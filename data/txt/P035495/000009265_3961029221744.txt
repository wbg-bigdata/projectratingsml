SOCIAL PROTECTION PROJECT
1. SOCIAL ISSUES IN ARGENTINA
A. Economic Setting'
1.1   Four years have passed since Argentina, emerging from the severe economic
crisis of 1989-90, adopted the Convertibility Plan. This innovative plan restructured
Argentina's economic landscape through reforms of the state and financial institutions,
privatization, and liberalization of foreign and domestic credit. From extreme hyper-
inflation, the country moved relatively quickly to a low annual inflation rate of 3.9
percent in 1994. Output and productivity increases have been remarkable for the last
four years, with GDP growth averaging 7.7 percent annually. The initial consumption-
led boom matured into a healthy pattern of investment and export-led growth.
Privatization of state assets has been far-reaching, and much more successful than
expected. As a result of the economic recovery, poverty levels declined significantly,
although economic restructuring with a rigid labor market has resulted in increased
unemployment, which reached about 13 percent of the labor force by late 1994.
1.2   With the dynamic evolution of the economy, shifting from consumption to
export and investment-led growth, GDP in 1993 and 1994 grew by 6 and 7.1 percent
respectively. Gross fixed investment reached 20 percent in 1994, associated with
increased national and foreign savings. Exports, which were affected by declining
international prices in 1992-93, rose by 20 percent in 1994, with manufactured goods
exports exhibiting particular buoyancy, growing at an average of 27 percent in
1993-94. Better international prices for grains and improved economic conditions in
Brazil contributed to the growth in exports. Imports of capital goods led the expansion,
indicative of the acceleration in investment and the restructuring of the economy.
Financing trade and current account deficits was not difficult, given Argentina's
improved access to international financial markets during 1993 and 1994. During the
first two months of 1995, exports rose by 35 percent, while imports remained
approximately at the previous year's level.
l  See the Country Assistance Strategy dated April 10, 1995 for a more comprehensive assessment of
Argentina's economic prospects.

B. The Mexico Crisis and Its Inpact on Argentina
1.3   Despite these achievements, Argentina is now facing its first serious financial
crisis since the implementation of the Convertibility Plan in 1991. The country has
been particularly vulnerable to the events in Mexico, due to Argentina's relatively
heavy reliance on foreign capital inflows (financing in 1994 an estimated current
account deficit of 3.6 percent of GDP), the inflexibility of its exchange rate regime,
and the need for a strong financial system under the Convertibility Plan. Higher
international interest rates and the Mexico crisis have reduced capital inflows. From
December 1994 through March 1995, the stock market declined by about 30 percent
and banking deposits fell by about 15 percent. Consequently, economic activity has
slowed considerably, with economic growth during 1995 expected to be flat.
1.4  In mid-March 1995, the Government reacted forcefully to mitigate the crisis.
To reestablish a fiscal surplus, it cut expenditures on export subsidies, public sector
wages, social security expenditures, and federally-funded social services, while raising
the VAT rate and other taxes. The Government extended to March 31, 1996 its
program with the International Monetary Fund, (IMF) and announced that tax
adjustments would generate a fiscal surplus of 1.4 percent of GDP (including
privatization proceeds) in 1995. The announced measures are estimated to yield US$6.3
billion, equivalent to 2 percent of GDP, in the remainder of 1995. At the same time,
public expenditures were cut by 3.6 percent in comparison with the original budget
approved in December 1994. This decline is expected to result in a contraction in
public sector wages, investment, and non-wage recurrent spending for a large number
of federal programs, including social services (see below).
1.5   The Government is reinvigorating the adjustment process by passing legislation
capping social security pensions, liberalizing labor laws to small and medium
enterprises, and taking measures to restructure the financial system by accelerating the
privatization of provincial banks and the consolidation of private banks. To bolster its
adjustment program, the Government has assembled a financial package of
approximately US$11 billion from multilateral organizations (US$5.4 billion from
IMF, the Bank and Inter-American Development Bank, IDB), the Japanese EXIM Bank
(US$0.8 billion), bond sales (US$2.3 billion) and projected asset sales (US$2.4
billion).
1.6   The strong and rapid reaction of the Government to the crisis has reduced
concerns about its future domestic action but the external environment remains
uncertain. Although the initially strong negative reaction of financial markets to the
Mexican crisis has now improved, there remains a reluctance to redirect significant
flows towards emerging markets, particularly in Latin America. Even under an
optimistic scenario, in which the principal countries affected by the crisis adopt

appropriate economic policy measures that reestablish credibility in the eyes of
international investors in the next few months, access to international financial markets
would be only slowly regained beginning in late 1995, and capital inflows would
remain below those observed in previous years.
C. Argentina's Poverty and Unemployment Situation
1.7   The general slowdown in economic activity, the rise in unemployment, and the
recent reduction of public expenditures could have adverse effects on social conditions.
A risk exists that the country's poverty situation, which has improved substantially
since 1989, could deteriorate under these circumstances.
1.8   Argentina's poverty level2 declined significantly between 1990 and 1993.
During that time, the share of the population living in poverty fell from about 35
percent to 20 percent. In Metropolitan Buenos Aires (MBA), where more than a third
of the country's population lives, the 1993 poverty rate (the proportion of the
population below an estimated poverty line) was 17.6 percent, or almost half its 1990
level. Not only did poverty in MBA greatly diminish in the 1990s, but the poor as a
group did not experience as much extreme poverty as in the past.
1.9   Notwithstanding these improvements, poverty remains a reality for a sizable
part of the population. Even though lack of reliable data on rural poverty continues to
be a problem, some limited information based on case studies, qualitative assessments
and surveys points to acute poverty in rural areas. The highest rates of poverty --
averaging 40 percent -- occur in the provinces in the Northeast and Northwest of the
country. The rate of poverty decline in the early 1990s has been much swifter in MBA
than in the remote provinces. While all provincial cities have experienced a fall in
poverty between 1990 and 1992, the speed of decline has been slowest in the northern
provinces. As a result, the share of the nation's poor living in the north has risen from
24 percent to 29 percent.
1.10 Rising unemployment has become a major concern in Argentina, in part because
it exacerbates the country's poverty situation (in 1993, more than 25 percent of the
unemployed population in MBA were living below the poverty line). Despite the
impressive growth performance of the Argentine economy during 1990-94, the number
of net jobs created was only around 350,000 or a 3.1 percent cumulative increase for
the four-year period. Most of this growth took place in 1991-1992. In 1993 there was
no employment growth, and in 1994 there was a net decrease of about 1.5 percent.
Consequently, the unemployment rate reached a high of about 13 percent of the labor
2  Data on household income used to measure poverty are only available from Argentina's urban areas.
However, since nearly 85 percent of the population lives in the cities, the numbers cited here are
broadly representative of the country as a whole. See "Argentina's Poor: A Profile," dated June
27, 1995.

force in October 1994 and 18.6% in May 1995, up from an average rate of about 6
percent in earlier years. Structural constraints in the Argentine labor market (i.e.,
segmentation and excessive regulations) and the effects of economic restructuring
largely explain these developments.
1.11   Current unemployment disproportionately affects the young (half of the
unemployed are less than 25 years old) with incomplete secondary or primary
education; less skilled workers (the unemployment rate for blue collar workers is nearly
four times the rate for professionals); and heads of households between 45 and 65 years
old. Unemployment rates are also about 25 percent higher for women than for men,
with the largest difference prevailing for the 35-49 age group. By economic sector,
unemployment is particularly high in construction and traditional manufacturing
industries such as textiles and clothing.
D. Social Budget Retrenchment and Program Issues
1.12          Public social expenditure3 under the Convertibility Plan has been growing
in absolute and relative terms, reflecting the Government's commitment to invest in human
capital and reduce poverty. Consolidated public social expenditure increased from 16.4
percent of GDP in the 1984-88 period to 17.3 percent during the first Menem
Administration (1989-94), reaching US$51.4 billion or 18.4 percent in 1994 (Table 1.1). It
is worth noting that this increase took place as the size of the overall public sector
diminished from 33.2 percent of GDP during the previous administration to 29.9 percent
in the 1989-94 period, on account of a major privatization effort. Consequently, overall
social spending as a share of total public expenditure rose significantly from 49.5 percent
in the 1984-88 period to 67.2 percent in 1994.
3 Public social spending includes expenditures of the national government, the provinces, and
municipalities in the social sectors (culture and education, health, housing, nutrition, water and
sanitation, social welfare, labor, sports, et.al.), and social insurance (social security, family
allowances, health funds, and unemployment insurance).

1.13 Within the social areas, more than half of the 1994 budget (57.3 percent) was
devoted to social insurance programs, including old age and disability pensions, health
insurance, family allowances, and unemployment insurance.4 This high proportion of
spending for social insurance, mostly financed through earmarked payroll taxes,
reflects Argentina's aging population profile, non-communicable disease epidemiology,
and an increased pool of unemployed persons and the working poor requiring social
assistance. Within social insurance, the largest proportional increases in spending have
occurred in social security pensions (up from 34 percent of the total in 1984-88 to
nearly 39 percent in 1994) and in health insurance for the elderly under the Instituto
Nacional de Seguridad Social para Jubilados y Pensionados, or INSSJP (from 4 to 5.1
percent during the same period). The remainder of public social expenditures (42.7
percent of the total) consists of education and health (excluding insurance), housing and
social welfare.
1.14 Taking into account all social expenditures, including social insurance, in 1994
the Federal Government accounted for 54 percent, provinces for 39.3 percent, and
municipalities for 6.7 percent of public social spending.5   Responsibility for social
spending has been shifting over time from the Federal Government to provincial and
municipal governments. This trend towards fiscal decentralization was further
accentuated in 1993, when the federal govemment transferred responsibility and
budgets for secondary education and public hospitals to the provinces. As a result, in
1994, about 62.6 percent of public social expenditure excluding social security was
executed by provinces and municipalities, even though part of those were still financed
by the Federal Government (e.g., the housing program, FONAVI). At the same time,
the Federal Government has maintained its responsibility for social insurance
expenditures, with social security alone accounting for 57.4 percent of the Federal
Government's social expenditure.

1.15 In response to the recent economic crisis that was initially manifested in Mexico
and spilled over to a number of emerging markets including Argentina, the Federal
Government in December 1994 and again in March 1995 cut its original 1995 budget
by a total of 3.9 percent or US$1.6 billion (from US$42.9 billion to US$41.3 billion).
The cuts in federal social sector expenditures were slightly lower - about 2.4 percent
(from US$27.9 billion to US$27.2 billion) - because social security programs and
several social programs based on transfers to the provinces, and thus linked to
earmarked taxes, were not affected by the cuts. Excluding social insurance
expenditures, the federal budget for the traditional social sectors was reduced by about
6.3 percent, from US$8.6 billion to about US$8.1 billion. The programs suffering the
largest cuts were education (down by 9.2 percent), health and labor (3.5 percent each).
1.16 Despite these recent cuts, total social spending in the adjusted 1995 budget in
real terms remains approximately unchanged from the actual spending levels of 1994 (a
small increase of 0.6 percent). At the same time, the adjusted 1995 budget for non-
social expenditures is 5.9 percent lower in real terms than the actual level of spending
in 1994 (Table 1.2). As a result, the share of social spending in the overall budget is
expected to rise from 64.5 percent in the 1994 executed budget to 66 percent in the
adjusted 1995 budget. In other words, in the face of budget cutbacks, the Federal
Government thus far has protected social spending relatively more than other areas and
has maintained social spending in absolute terms.

I By March 1996
1.17 The adjusted 1995 federal social budget of US$27.2 billion includes social
insurance (US$19.2 billion) and traditional programs "targeted" to the poor (US$3.8
billion) and of a more "universal" nature (US$4.3 billion). Even after taking into
account the announced budget cuts, the changes in spending between 1994 and 1995
vary substantially among these three categories -- a real decline of 4.1 percent for
social insurance and real increases of 2 percent for universal programs and of 38
percent for the targeted programs. In other words, despite the fact that the social
programs directed to the poor have been cut in 1995 about the same amount as the rest
of the federal budget, planned spending for these poverty programs is still more than
one-third higher than in the previous year of 1994. The Government's decision to
continue raising the budget of some of these programs in the future would be tempered
by the fact that some programs require significant improvement in internal efficiency
more than increased financing.



8
1.18 If the Federal Government makes any additional budget cuts before the end of
1995, however, these could fall heavily on the traditional social expenditures, resulting
in real declines in overall social outlays and eroding the increases that the targeted
programs currently expect to receive. This is because the current system of obligatory
and automatic national revenue transfers to the provinces (co-participation), and the
financing of other programs such as social security and interest on public debt that are
difficult or impossible to cut, leave the Government with a narrow base of a little more
than a fifth of the total budget from which any or all cuts would have to occur. Under
these circumstances, it is critical that the Government protect and increase the
efficiency of its spending for health, nutrition, education, rural development, and
employment and income support programs targeted to the poor.
E. Govermment Social Policy and Strategy
1.19 The Government's letter of social policy dated October 10, 1995 (Annex 1)
argues that the intensification of economic growth and the maintenance of stability
would strengthen overall social conditions in the country. The Government intends to
attach high priority to the development of policies to create new employment
opportunities and to invest in human resources (through education, training, and health
services) to prepare people for a competitive labor market.
1.20 To fight against unemployment, the Government is implementing a very
comprehensive policy. First, the Government is setting measures to improve the
functioning of the labor market: (i) the Law on contracts (Ley de Modalidades de
Contratacion, passed in March 1995) prescribes a three month probationary period for
apprenticeship contracts and streamlines part-time work; (ii) the Law on small and
medium enterprises (Ley de PYMES passed in March 1995) provides more flexibility
over contractual modes, labor practices and provides separate considerations for
collective bargaining agreements; (iii) the Compensation Insurance Law (Ley de
Riesgos de Trabajo submitted to the Congress) would reduce the costs supported by the
wages; (iv) the Law on bankruptcy (Ley de Quiebras submitted to the Congress) would
consolidate the economic restructuring process and subsequent sectoral shifts; and (v) a
law to modify the actual system of labor negotiations and labor contracts will be sent to
Congress. Second, the Government announced in August 1995 a package of measures
to increase employment and fiscal revenues: (i) a reduction of labor taxes will be done
progressively between September 1995 and January 1996, reducing the cost of labor by
about 7.5 percent in Buenos Aires to 20 percent in provinces like Chaco, Formosa and
Santiago de Estero; (ii) workers with salaries above $2000 per month will not receive
family allowances and the money saved will be deposited in a special fund for
emergencies and training for low income workers; (iii) enterprises that hire workers
over 55 years of age will be exempted from all labor taxes and contributions for these
workers; and (iv) the minimum age for employment, which at the present time is 14



9
years, would be increased and education or training for all the population below the
minimum age would be guaranteed.
1.21 To improve the quality and efficiency of spending for the social sectors, the
Government has sought the assistance of the World Bank. Major projects to strengthen
primary, secondary, and higher education have recently begun or are about to be
finalized. The recently effective Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary
Education Project (Ln.3794-AR) will strengthen the central education ministry and
seven provincial ministries. The Higher Education Reform Project (Ln. 3794-AR),
which has already been approved, will support a series of efficiency-enhancing
measures, including increased financial autonomy for universities, an accreditation and
evaluation system for public and private institutions, and a more transparent financial
mechanism for allocating federal resources to Argentine universities.
1.22 Similarly, important initiatives are being carried out for the health sector. The
ongoing Maternal and Child Health and Nutntion Project (Ln. 3643-AR) is targeting poor
mothers and young children in the urban poverty belts and the underdeveloped northern
provinces. A recently approved Provincial Health Development Project (Ln 3931-AR)
will transform public hospitals into independent trusts, strengthen the management
systems, develop hospital accreditation, and test new hospital reimbursement practices.
To enhance the efficiency of the more than 3 percent of GDP spent through the
Argentine health insurance system, the Government is planning to undertake a reform
program, with the help of a World Bank loan.
1.23 The development and implementation of an effective social policy is severely
constrained by the paucity of information and of appropriate systems to target, monitor
and evaluate social development actions, especially those meant to benefit the poor.
The Federal Government, through the Secretaria de Desarrollo Social (SDS), is
spearheading the development of targeting approaches for social programs and the
monitoring and evaluation of resulting actions. More specifically, SDS is launching a
program called SIEMPRO (Sistema de Informaci6n, Evaluaci6n y Monitoreo de
Programas Sociales) that would establish the information system to help improve
social program management in Argentina. With SIEMPRO's assistance, corresponding
capacity in poverty monitoring and targeting, evaluation and monitoring of social
programs would be developed in the provinces, which are now primarily responsible
for delivering social services. The Government is also encouraging the participation of
non-governmental and community-based organizations in programs specifically directed
to the extreme poor to complement weak public service delivery.

2. ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
A. Rationale for Bank Involvement
2.1   The proposed loan is fully consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy which was presented to the Board on May 4, 1995, with the Provincial Bank
Privatization project (Ln. 3878-AR). The strategy focuses on supporting Argentina's
efforts to: (a) consolidate and deepen structural reforms, with strong support during the
1995 crisis period; (b) reduce poverty and develop human resources; and (c) rebuild the
country's deteriorated infrastructure base. The proposed loan for the Social Protection
Project, part of a US$1.3 billion emergency package offered by the Bank to Argentina
(and including operations to reform the banking and health insurance sectors), would
help safeguard the delivery of critical social services to the poor and those most
adversely affected by the current economic crisis, particularly the unemployed, and
improve the efficiency of social expenditures. Thus, the proposed project would
support objective (b), related to poverty reduction and human resources development.
2.2   The Bank is already contributing substantial resources to improving the quality,
efficiency and effectiveness of social services in Argentina through a set of lending
operations in education and health, plus a health financing study and a recent poverty
assessment. In addition the Bank produced a background report entitled "Labor Market
and Institutions" for the Argentina Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) which
provides an analysis of the employment situation, a description of recent labor policy
reforms, and orientations for future governmental action. Through these activities, the
Bank has developed sector knowledge and strong ties with social sector agencies that
enable it to play a unique role in assisting Argentina during the current economic crisis.
B. The Role of Other Donors
2.3   The IDB has recently approved a US$450 million Social Sector Adjustment
Loan, designed to disburse in three tranches between July 1995 and June 1996. The
IDB and the Bank have worked closely together, both in Washington and in the field,
to ensure consistency in the operational design and conditionalities of their respective
operations. The key conditionality in the IDB operation relates to maintaining for 1995
at least 85 percent of the planned federal expenditure of US$1.039 million for a broad
"basket" of 23 targeted social programs. This is complemented by the proposed
condition in the Social Protection Project that the Government achieve at least 100
percent of planned 1995 spending for key social programs (within the basket of 23
programs) in the areas of employment, education, health and nutrition. To ensure that
federal social spending is rationalized over the coming years, the World Bank project
contains a conditionality that the Government carry out a public social expenditure



11
review. The Bank's project finances a major effort to build capacity to evaluate social
programs and improve their design and management.
2.4   There is strong complementarity between the IDB and World Bank operations at
the individual sector and program level. IDB's support for a national nutrition plan and
for improvements in the Ministry of Health's maternal and child health care program
are matched by World Bank protection of the ASOMA nutrition program. Similarly,
in the area of labor and employment, the IDB loan focuses on the implementation of
new labor legislation and the development of a labor market information system, while
the World Bank operation supports improvements in the design and management of
public works employment programs and the development of a more effective
surveillance system for unemployment insurance.
C. Lessons Learned from Other Operations
2.5   There has been no previous Bank experience in Argentina with this type of
project, which finances a number of existing social programs for a two year "time-
slice." A similar operation - the Mexico Program of Essential Social Services
(PROSSE), (Ln.3912-MX) - will be in an early implementation stage by the time the
Argentina operation is ready for Bank approval. Some lessons learned from the
preparation phase of the Mexico project are that: (a) it is important to identify up-front
social programs that use procurement and financial accounting practices already
acceptable to the Bank, to ensure that government expenditures would be eligible for
Bank financing; (b) choosing a limited number of relatively large social programs
greatly simplifies implementation; and (c) social expenditure conditionality should be
simple, clearly monitorable, and should build in some flexibility for adjustments in the
"outer" years to be agreed between the Government and the Bank. Each of these
lessons has been taken into account in the proposed project. A major effort has gone
into reviewing procurement and accounting practices during pre-appraisal and
appraisal. In the end, only Federal Government programs in employment and
education would be financed directly with the proposed loan. The expenditure
conditionality would set an aggregate floor level for 1996, but would be defined in
greater detail during consultations between the Argentine Government and the Bank
during the last quarter of 1995.
2.6   Relevant lessons learned from Bank experience with social investment funds
(SIFs) are now relatively abundant. The major lessons, which were taken into account
in the design of this operation, include: (a) appropriate integration of a social fund as
part of a country's poverty alleviation strategy and overall economic reform program;
(b) complementarity of SIF subprojects with other investments in the social sectors; (c)
the desirability of financing small, technologically simple projects with substantial
community involvement; (d) the need for transparency; (e) the need to attract high-
caliber staff by maintaining a non-bureaucratic environment and paying competitive



12
salaries to induce higher productivity; (f) the importance of using some monitorable
form of poverty targeting; (g) the involvement of both decentralized agencies and
NGOs/grassroots organizations in subproject implementation; and (h) the inclusion of
strong supervision mechanisms, both by the social fund during subproject execution and
through careful donor supervision.
2.7   Lessons of previous Bank technical assistance operations, incorporated into the
design of the proposed project, include: (a) Technical assistance (TA) projects should
be limited in scope, to permit focused implementation and supervision; (b) borrower
commitment and ownership of the project is essential to ensure implementability; (c)
continuity in project management is required to ensure sustainability; and (d)
appropriate institutionalization of the systems recommended or resulting from the TA
assistance should be sought.
3. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
3.1   The project's major objectives are to: (a) protect critical social programs for the
poor and the vulnerable during the period of severe fiscal restraint in 1995 and 1996;
(b) assist in providing income support to those who would be adversely affected by the
economic measures, especially those who would lose their jobs; and (c) improve the
focus and management of social programs by promoting transparency and efficiency,
participation of the civil society, and better targeting of social services to the poor. The
project supports the implementation of the Government's social policy (see Annex 1).
3.2   The project would protect planned 1995 spending for nine key social programs,
of which four would be financed partly by the Bank Loan. The latter would be
employment and training programs which respond to the recent marked increase in
unemployment being experienced in Argentina. For 1996, the set of programs to be
protected would be discussed and agreed with the Bank in late 1995. However, for the
purpose of estimating project costs, the budgetary allocations of the 1995 protected
programs are used for 1996. At appraisal a critical review of each of the selected
social programs was carried out, to ensure that benefits go to appropriate beneficiaries,
program management is relatively efficient, and procurement is generally in line with
Bank guidelines.
3.3   The project would also test a new mechanism - the pilot phase of the
Participatory Social Investment Fund (Fondo Participativo de Inversion Social, FOPAR)
- for channeling financial resources to targeted community-based subprojects,
strengthening social organizations and carrying out small-scale investments to address
basic needs. The project would finance a program of technical assistance (Sistema de
Informaci6n, Evaluaci6n, y Monitoreo de Programas Sociales, SIEMPRO) to develop



13
methodologies and systems for improving the targeting, evaluation and monitoring of
national and provincial social programs.
B. Project Description
3.4   The project would have three major components: (A) Priority Social and
Income Support Programs; (B) Pilot Participatory Social Investment Fund (FOPAR);
and (C) Improvement of Social Information, Targeting and Monitoring of Social
Programs (SIEMPRO). While FOPAR and SIEMPRO are discussed as separate
components of the Social Protection Project, they are essential parts of one SDS
program - the Participatory Social Development Program (Programa Participativo de
Desarollo Social, PRODESO) created by Resolution No. 2851 of September 15, 1995.
Each component of the Social Protection Project is described in detail in the following
sections.
Component A: Priority Social and Income Support Programs (US$366.8 million,
or 88 percent of total cost)
3.5   Under this component, loan funds would be used to finance a share of the 1995
federal budget for selected social programs in the areas of employment
(PROAS/PRENO, APRENDER (ex-PRONAPAS) and FORESTAR), and education
(PLAN SOCIAL EDUCATIVO). At the same time, the budgets of nine highly-
effective social programs, i.e., those mentioned above plus others in the areas of
nutrition, health, and rural development, would be protected in 1995 and 1996. The
protected programs have a total authorized (March 1995) budget of about US$300
million for 1995 (Table 3.1).
3.6   The nine protected programs were selected for Bank financing using the
following criteria: (a) effectiveness of targeting to the poor; (b) ability to provide
income support to the unemployed; (c) internal program efficiency; and (d) potential for
further rapid improvements in program effectiveness. The current targeting
mechanisms and proposed measures for improving program efficiency over the next two
years of the protected programs are described below and in Annex 2. Likewise, sample
monitoring indicators for the majority of those nine programs are presented in Annex 3.
At negotiations, some indicators and corresponding information being generated by the
Budget Evaluation Department (DEP) in the Secretariat of Finance were discussed.
Assurances were obtained that the Government would furnish the Bank not later
than December 15, 1995 a set of indicators, satisfactory to the Bank, to be used
for the monitoring of the execution of the protected programs (para. 9.1 (e)).
3.7   Maintaining and lmproving Public Social Expenditures. The nine protected
programs are a subset of the larger "basket" of 23 targeted federal social programs
with a March 1995 budget of US$1.039 billion (Annex Table 2.1). As part of the



14
IDB loan for social sector adjustment approved in 1995, the Government has agreed
to maintain the authorized budget of this basket and to spend in aggregate at least 85
percent of the authorized budget for 1995.6
3.8    To ensure that critical social programs receive adequate budget support during
1995 and 1996, during negotiations, agreement was obtained that:
(a)   The Government would ensure that its expenditures in 1995 for the
above protected social programs would amount in the aggregate to at least
US$300 million and would inform the Bank in writing, no later than
February 28, 1996 of the actual level and composition of 1995 expenditures
for the protected programs (para. 9.1(a));
(b)   By no later than December 15, 1995, the Government would furnish
the Bank a report on the physical and rmancial performance of the
protected programs for the first semester of the year (para. 9.1 (b)).
(c)   By no later than December 15, 1995, the Government would provide
the Bank with a proposal, acceptable to the Bank, describing the size and
composition of the selected employment programs to be rmanced by the
Loan under component A of the project during 1996 (para. 9.1(c)); the
submission of this satisfactory proposal to the Bank is a condition of
disbursement for Component A for 1996 (para. 9.2(a)); and
(d)   By December 15, 1995, the Government would furnish to the Bank
evidence that it has budgeted sufficient funds for the protected programs in
1996 in an aggregate amount at least equal to US$300 million (para. 9.1(d)).
3.9   Public Social Expenditure Review. To improve the longer-run efficiency of
public spending for social programs, the DNPGS of the MOE would carry out in 1996
a major review of public expenditures for the social sectors. Loan funds would be used
to finance this review. If the Govemment deems appropriate, the results of this review
could be used as an important input in the formulation of the 1997 budget. Draft terms
of reference for the study were reviewed during negotiations and were found to be
generally satisfactory. The Bank provided some comments on the terms of reference and
will further exchange views and information with DNPGS on the matter. It was
confirmed at negotiations that the Govermnent, through DNPGS, would provide
the Bank with rmal terms of reference, satisfactory to the Bank, not later than
6  More specifically, the IDB project stipulates that the authorized budget for the basket cannot be
changed unless the overall federal budget is cut by more than 4 percent. If the overall budget is cut
by more than 4 percent, the cut in the authorized budget for the basket cannot be more than half of
the overall percentage reduction. In addition, the basket is divided into two groups of programs:
Group A with a budget of US$762.9 million, and Group B with a budget of US$276.6 billion.
Actual expenditures for 1995 must exceed 90 percent of Group A, but only 70 percent of Group B.
This yields an average of 84.7 percent.

social expenditures not later than May 31, 1996, and on provincial social
expenditures not later than December 31, 1996. (para.9. 1(f)).
Selected Programs for 1995
3.10  The following sections describe in detail the characteristics of the education and
employment programs which would be partly financed by the Bank loan. Other
programs selected for budget protection but for which loan funds would not be used are
described in detail in Annex 2.
3.11   Education Program (Plan Social Educativo, or PSE). The PSE began in
January 1993 as a way for the federal government to help poor disadvantaged
communities and to guarantee greater equity in the access to basic education. The PSE
was created as an instrument to implement the Federal Education Law of April 1993,
which extends compulsory education to nine years of schooling for each child,
establishes the principle of free basic education, and calls for special federal programs
to ensure universal access to basic education. The PSE's objectives are to: (a) improve
the teaching process by providing textbooks, teaching materials, and teacher training;
(b) support innovative school-based quality improvement projects; and (c) increase
access by building new schools, rehabilitating existing schools, and closing precarious
facilities.
3.12 PSE beneficiaries are children living in areas with the greatest percentage of the
population in poverty. In addition, the Ministry of Culture and Education (MCE)
targets schools with: (a) sub-standard facilities; (b) more than two shifts a day; (c)
existence of boarding facilities; (d) high repetition and drop-out rates; (e) rural area
locations with scattered populations; (f) a high percentage of working, indigenous or
migrant pupils; and (g) insufficient physical capacity to meet local demand. An
operational manual provides guidance to municipalities and schools on accessing the
PSE.
3.13 PSE's initial 1995 budget of US$129 million has already been reduced to
US$99.4 million. The project would protect this reduced budget by financing: (a)
about 2 million textbooks and 5 million exercise books; (b) teaching materials paid
through direct transfers to about 6,000 schools (at US$7 per pupil, US$50 per
classroom and US$2,000 per school); (c) construction of 107,500 m2 of new schools;
and (d) rehabilitation of 500 schools.

(construction/repair of classrooms), or approximately US$39.5 million; and (b) up to

3.15 Employment Programs. The Argentine government's employment policy is
based upon employment law No. 240315 of December 1991. It is reflected in three
types of programs managed by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MTSS):
employment programs, training programs, and unemployment insurance (Table 3.2).
These programs are financed from the Fondo Nacional de Empleo (FNE), which

remaining funds have been reallocated to APRENDER.

receives resources from an earmarked tax of 1.5 percent of salaries. There are
numerous similar direct or indirect employment/training programs, such as the
Programa Joven financed by the IDB and the Programa de Capacitaci6n Tecnica
implemented by other ministries or by the provinces. In some cases, there is
overlapping among programs. The current structure can be confusing for potential
users and generates high administrative costs.

3.16 The resources of the FNE are expected to decline from US$562.9 million in
1994 to US$460.6 million in 1995, mainly because of lower payroll taxation rates and
a decrease in overall employment. The outlook for 1996 is also gloomy. In this
context, the project would support the policy of the MTSS to increase the efficiency of
its employment programs by: (a) eliminating the least effective programs; (b) reducing
program administrative costs; and (c) improving monitoring and supervision in order to
strengthen targeting and reduce fraud. A major objective is to reduce the cost per
beneficiary, which has already dropped from US$2,083 in 1993 to US$1,581 in 1994,
These programs correspond to the budget as March 1995. PROCRED and PROPYMES, programs
which are aimed at providing incentives to employees to hire unemployed are not implemented and
are phased out.



18
and is expected to drop further in 1995 to US$927 and in 1996 to US$740. The IDB
would complement the World Bank project by addressing the improvement of the labor
market regulatory framework and the administration and functioning of employment
offices, in order to provide better information to the public.
3.17 The MTSS has already adopted a series of measures designed to improve its
employment and training policy by: (a) closing the least efficient programs such as
"Programa de Empleo de Interes Social" (PROEDIS), "Programa de Subsidio a las
Primas de Accidentes ", "Programa Asistencia Crediticia para Empleadores" and
'Ayuda Economica al Concluir el Periodo de Seguro de Desempleo;" (b) merging
PRENO into PROAS in a single management structure; (c) eliminating the "Programa
de Apoyo a las PYMES" and merging its funds into "Programa de Empleo Privado,"
and (d) closing "PRONAPAS" and allocating the funds to a new program
"APRENDER." The MTSS will continue to rationalize its programs during the project.
3.18 Institutional strengthening of the MTSS. The project would finance
technical assistance for a total cost of $3.5 million necessary to increase the efficiency
of the employment and training programs. This technical assistance would support five
main activities: (a) a broad review of Argentine employment/training programs,
focusing on their consistency with employment issues, impact and level of compliance
with targeted objectives, administrative costs and cost-effectiveness, in order to provide
the basis for the design of new employment and training policy; (b) design of an
information system for unemployment insurance that would strengthen verification of
individuals' eligibility; (c) improvements in the targeting and management of
employment and training programs (for instance, by setting up a methodology in
PROAS to select the public works to be financed, using poverty and employment
indicators and standardized subproject documentation); (d) improvements in labor
market intermediation services; and (e) institutional strengthening of the MTSS,
principally to build the capacity to monitor and evaluate employment and training
programs. In addition, the project would finance the following equipment for a total
cost of $1.3 million: (a) in the MTSS, ten micro-computers along with printers and
other communication equipment for monitoring programs and communicating with
decentralized agencies in the Provinces; and (b) in the implementing agencies in the
Provinces, 110 microcomputers (an average of 4 by agency) and related printing and
communication equipment. To help coordinate the implementation of this technical
assistance, no later than January 31, 1996, the MTSS would hire a project
manager for the duration of the project whose terms of reference and
qualifications are satisfactory to the Bank (para. 9.1(g)).
3.19 PROAS/PRENO are two public works programs which differ only in their
financing plans and geographic locations. PROAS is implemented in the provinces of
Salta, Chaco, Misiones, Tucuman, Formosa, Jujuy, Santiago del Estero, Buenos
9 PROCRED and PROPYMES, programs which are aimed at providing incentives to employees to
hire unemployed are not implemented and will be phased out.



19
Aires, Corrientes, Catamarca, Santa Fe, San Juan, and La Rioja, with the provinces
contributing about 7 percent of total costs. PRENO is implemented in the provinces of
Mendoza, Chubut, Cordoba, Entre Rios, Rio Negro, Neuquen, San Luis, Tierra del
Fuego, La Pampa and Santa Cruz, which contribute about a third of total costs. The
MTSS finances the stipends given to the beneficiaries who participate in the public
works (US$39.6 million for PROAS and US$14.4 million for PRENO in 1995), the
Secretaria de Desarrollo Social covers the cost of tools and materials (US$37.5 million
for PROAS and US$12.6 million for PRENO), and the provinces bear the
implementation costs at the local level (US$6.1 million in PROAS and US$12.9 million
in PRENO). Since August 1995 those two programs have been merged into one single
program called PROAS.
3.20 PROAS/PRENO is used for the provision of water and sanitation, housing and
schools rehabilitation and other social infrastructure. By recruiting the poor, disabled,
and chronically unemployed, and by paying an allocation of about US$200 per month,
PRENO and PROAS effectively target the most needy households. About 2,000
projects are financed every year and about 44,000 households currently benefit from
the programs -- 33,000 from PROAS and 11,000 from PRENO. By selecting basic
social infrastructure for rehabilitation, they also contribute to poverty reduction. An
operating manual provides guidance to the municipalities on preparing projects. In
each province, a representative of the MTSS supervises the preparation and
implementation of the project.
3.21 APRENDER. This apprenticeship program was created by Ministerial decision
No. 461 of June 13, 1995. APRENDER benefits youths aged 16 to 25 with less than
secondary education, facilitating their entry into the labor market. For each
apprenticeship contract, it finances the costs to the employer of social insurance (US$9
per month) and of accident insurance premiums (US$12 - US$15/month) for 6 to 12
months. APRENDER provides scholarships to unemployed young persons attending
on-the-job training in private firms. The number of beneficiaries is expected to be
60,000 a year. APRENDER will use the remaining funds of the PRONAPAS, which
provided scholarships to unemployed young persons attending on-the-job training in
private firms.
3.22 FORESTAR (created by Ministerial decision No. 122 of August 7, 1995),
finances a monthly allocation of US$200 unemployed persons hired by firms working
on reforestation projects. Such payments may continue for a maximum of three
months. A total of US$8 million has been budgeted for this program for 1995.
3.23  PEP/PYMES (created by Ministerial decision No. 47 of January 18, 1995 and
modified by decision No. 110 of August 1, 1995), is an apprenticeship program
designed to promote employment in small and medium scale private enterprises (less
than 100 employees). The beneficiaries are young persons 16 to 25 years old, women,
and unemployed persons more than 45 years old. They receive a US$200 allocation



20
from the PEP every two months during their contract, which cannot exceed 12 months.
Employers are expected to match the Government's contribution.
3.24 The proposed World Bank loan would finance: (a) 75 percent of the cost of
training and stipends of the selected employment programs; and (b) 100 percent of the
technical assistance and equipment needed for institutional strengthening of the MTSS.
(see para 3.18).
Component B: Participatory Social Investment Fund (Fondo Participativo de
Inversion Social, FOPAR (US$36.7 million or 8.7 percent of total cost).
3.25 FOPAR is a two-year pilot social fund channeling resources to community-
based, demand-driven projects, with involvement of local NGOs and close coordination
with provincial and municipal formal structures. In this pilot phase, FOPAR would
finance basic social needs of the extreme poor in selected districts in the northern
provinces of Argentina. FOPAR would place important emphasis on targeting poor
communities and vulnerable groups; developing the capacity of poor communities and
social organizations to identify suitable projects, mobilize resources, and implement
selected projects; and testing transparent mechanisms for channeling resources to social
operations.
3.26 FOPAR's financing would support: (a) community-based subprojects; and (b)
institutional development. The first subcomponent, with a total cost of US$25.8
million, would finance the implementation of a range of subprojects, with priority for
small-scale infrastructure and strengthening of community organizations. Maximum
subproject size would be US$100,000. An initial set of subproject types has been
selected; however, given FOPAR's pilot nature, this initial set would be revised
periodically to be responsive to the actual needs of poor communities. During
negotiations, agreement was obtained that any revision of eligible subproject types
would be subject to the prior approval of the Bank (para. 9.1(j)). The initial set of
subproject types include:
(a) Development and strengthening of community organizations, including
strengthening of grassroots organizations, development of community
leaders, training in the use of basic social services, and promotion of
community development, which would primarily be undertaken by NGOs.
(b) Small-scale infrastructure, including the construction, rehabilitation or
extension of small water systems, drainage, environmental sanitation, small
community works (pedestrian bridges, sidewalks, slope protection, etc.),
and community infrastructure (health posts, education centers,
cooking/dining and other communal facilities);
(c) Revolving funds for credits to urban micro-enterprises, including those
for the self-employed. These subprojects would aim at income and



21
employment generation, including capacity building of managerial abilities.
Two pilot revolving funds not larger than US$350,000 would be
established, whose operations would be contracted out through a
competitive process with an NGO or some other organization experienced
in financial intermediation; and
(d) Other eligible types of subprojects as defined in the FOPAR
Operational Manual.
3.27 The second FOPAR subcomponent, institutional development, has a total cost
of US$10.8 million. This component includes the establishment of institutional
arrangements (see Chapter 4) to operate the pilot project, including staffing, training,
technical assistance for project appraisal, supervision, ex-post evaluation of
community-based subprojects, and office equipment.
3.28 Community-Based Subprojects. With respect to its first subcomponent as
described above, FOPAR's approach and strategy for subproject selection would vary
depending on the type and location of poverty being addressed, the assessment of
potential beneficiaries, and the existing institutional framework at the local level. Two
types of communities would be addressed: (a) poor communities in small towns and
rural or semi-urban areas; and (b) deprived neighborhoods in urban areas located in the
outskirts of provincial capitals. The distinguishing characteristics of these communities
are elaborated in the FOPAR Operational Manual.
3.29 In poor communities, groups have an acute lack of the most essential services
and employment opportunities are scarce. However, most of these communities tend to
have social networks which provide a good foundation for organizational strengthening.
Support to poor communities would focus on strengthening grassroots organizations
with the aim of promoting participation, and on addressing critical needs as defined by
the communities themselves. Projects would be formulated by grassroots organizations
and be evaluated by FOPAR on a project-by-project basis. Based on preliminary
surveys undertaken by FOPAR, subprojects for these communities would tend towards
construction or rehabilitation of social infrastructure, training in the management of
basic social services, and creation of the capacity to identify and formulate projects
suitable to community needs.
3.30 In the case of deprived neighborhoods, poverty tends to originate from a sharp
decline in wages and employment, aggravated by migrations from rural areas. These
areas normally show poor housing conditions and low levels of access to social services
and basic infrastructure. In these neighborhoods, the starting point is to identify
specifically vulnerable target groups. These communities normally have limited active
social networks, because of the existence of many vulnerable groups and/or migrants
from other areas. The vulnerable groups include female-headed households, children
under the age of four, and unemployed young people. Given that in the provincial
capitals there is a relatively large number of intermediary NGOs involved in social



22
issues, FOPAR intends to target its interventions to pre-identified neighborhoods by
inviting proposals aimed at vulnerable groups. These proposals would be evaluated
according to pre-established criteria. This process is further described below.
Whenever demand exceeds available resources, final selection among eligible projects
would be made by provincial councils.
3.31   Community subprojects would be supported in the form of grants to community
organizations, or exceptionally to NGOs or public agencies. Loan proceeds would
finance 80 percent of subproject costs and the balance would be provided by the
communities themselves. In those cases where communities are unable to raise the
required counterpart funds, FOPAR would supplement their contributions, out of its
own resources, by an amount determined during the subproject appraisal.
3.32 Targeting. Poverty maps have been developed by FOPAR at the district level
based on information available from the population census and the household surveys.
The NBI was used as a key indicator. Based on this criterion, poverty is concentrated
in 92 out of 122 poorest districts in the ten northern provinces of Argentina. FOPAR
would allocate its resources to these 92 districts in proportion to the total population
with' NBI. This targeting methodology has been further refined by defining criteria for
selecting poor communities and deprived neighborhoods, with strong emphasis on the
identification of vulnerable groups. Poor communities would be eligible if they are
located in a district with at least 40 percent of the population with NBI and would
receive higher priority if they are not being served by existing programs. A similar
approach would be taken for selecting and prioritizing neighborhoods in the provincial
capitals. As lessons are learned during the first year of project implementation,
FOPAR would refine the identification of municipalities with high poverty incidence
and the corresponding priority criteria for FOPAR resource allocation.
3.33 Project Cycle. The project cycle to be used by FOPAR includes targeting,
promotion and identification of needs and projects, appraisal and selection,
implementation, and ex-post evaluation. Guiding principles and procedures for all
these processes are described in the FOPAR Operational Manual. Although
community-based subprojects are demand-driven, FOPAR has established resource
allocations and activity targets based on the criteria discussed above. Poor
communities and deprived neighborhoods would be selected through promotion efforts
involving local authorities, NGOs, and grassroots organizations. A field appraisal
would be carried out by FOPAR's regional offices and completed by the Project
Evaluation Unit in the Head Office. This group would also handle the selection
process for project proposals for deprived neighborhoods. Implementation would be
the responsibility of communities. FOPAR has established a project supervision
scheme for monitoring to be carried out by the Regional Offices. An information data
base would be established for all projects completed. In-depth ex-post evaluation
would be done for a sample of completed projects.



23
3.34   Monitoring and Evaluation. FOPAR would undertake periodic evaluations of
its interventions. This is considered a critical tool during the pilot phase, to provide
continuous feedback for assessing policies, methods and procedures to achieve its
objectives. Evaluations would attempt to establish the contributions that each
intervention has had for raising the living standard of beneficiaries. It would also
determine: (a) how well project objectives have met community needs; (b) the degree
of acceptance and satisfaction among beneficiaries; (c) preliminary effects of the
project on the community: and (d) actions undertaken by the community to ensure the
sustainability of the solutions provided by the project. The FOPAR Programming
Unit, in close collaboration with SIEMPRO, would undertake internal evaluations
through established information channels as a permanent monitoring of impact. In-
depth external evaluations of FOPAR's instruments and modes of intervention would
be carried out. Participatory workshops with beneficiaries would also be organized as
part of these evaluations, as well as annual ex-post evaluations of subprojects. A set of
monitoring indicators to assess FOPAR's implementation progress is shown in Annex
4.
Component C: Technical Assistance for the Improvement of Social Information
and Monitoring and Evaluation of Targeted Social Programs (Sistema de
Informacidn, Evaluacion y Monitoreo de Programas Sociales, or SIEMEPRO,
US$14.4 million or 3 percent of total cost).
3.35 The primary objective of SIEMPRO is to serve as a catalyst in changing the
focus and management of social programs by promoting transparency, participation of
the civil society and appropriate targeting of social services to the poor. It specifically
aims to:
(a) establish a social information base for timely monitoring and analysis of the
situation of the poor and vulnerable groups and thus serve as a basis for
targeting social programs;
(b) define and apply appropriate methodologies and systems for targeting,
monitoring and evaluation (ex-ante/ex-post) of social programs especially
directed to the poor and vulnerable groups;
(c) assist SDS in disseminating and transferring developed methodologies and
social information systems to appropriate national and provincial agencies, and
(d) assist the national Social Cabinet to establish priorities and assure
coordination of social programs directed to the poor.
3.36 SIEMPRO's components are described below. Key activities, corresponding
schedules and expected results are summarized in Annex 5 (Matrix of Key Activities).
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that any substantive change in the
Matrix of Key Activities would be satisfactory to the Bank (para. 9. l(q)). A



24
SIEMPRO Project Document elaborating component features, institutional framework
and implementing mechanisms was reviewed and found satisfactory by the Bank. This
Document was sent to the Bank with a letter of the SDS Secretary dated June 15, 1995.
Draft terms of reference of major studies were also reviewed by the Bank during
appraisal.
3.37 Social Information and Targeting. This component would enhance the type,
timeliness and availability of information to improve the targeting, design, monitoring
and evaluation of social programs targeted to the poor. Whenever appropriate,
SIEMPRO would coordinate its actions with the National Directorate of Social
Expenditure Programming (Direccion Nacional de Programacion de Gasto Social,
DNPGS) of the MOE. The project would finance the:
(a) establishment and maintenance of a permanent and updated social
information data base using primary and secondary data sources, in
collaboration with appropriate statistical institutions (primarily INDEC), other
government, academic and non-governmental institutions;
(b) technical improvement of some social indicators and household data
information including the development of a geo-referenced set of social
information;
(c) a special survey on access to social programs in relation to living conditions
to be carried out by INDEC;
(d) participatory qualitative studies (PQSs) which would assess the vulnerable
groups' perspective on life conditions, survival and coping strategies, as well as
required actions to reduce poverty; the PQSs would be subcontracted to
independent research groups or NGOs;
(e) development of vulnerability indices based on selected indicators which
would permit the representation of the heterogeneous poverty characteristics in
small areas; and
(f) development of appropriate criteria and methodology for targeting of social
programs.
3.38 Since INDEC would supply the bulk of detailed population and household data
to SIEMPRO, as well as carry out a special survey on access to social programs in
relation to living conditions, SDS and INDEC signed a Subsidiary Agreement on June
7, 1995. This Subsidiary Agreement sets out the terms and conditions for INDEC's
provision of information, as well as SDS' commitment to provide the necessary
consultant services and use of equipment for the generation of information which are
not normally produced by INDEC. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that unless agreed with the Bank, SDS would not terminate, amend or fail to



25
enforce any provision of this Subsidiary Agreement (para. 9.1 (o)). It was also
confirmed that the draft terms of reference and tentative design of the survey on
access to social programs in relation to living conditions, prepared in coordination,
with DNPGS in areas of its competence, would be furnished to the Bank for its
review and comment (para. 9. 1(p)). The specific actions to be carried out under the
Subsidiary Agreement are summarized in Annex 6.
3.39 Evaluation and Monitoring of Targeted Social Programs. This component
aims to establish a system of monitoring and evaluation of targeted social programs to
assist the Social Cabinet in its coordination function. The activities of this component
started in the first quarter of 1995. An initial compilation of information on national
targeted social programs was prepared and served as an important background
document for Component A of this project. The SIEMPRO component would finance
the:
(a)   establishment and periodic updating of a data bank on national and
provincial social programs especially directed to the poor and promotion of
similar data bank for NGO projects. The data bank would include, among
others, information available from DNPGS of MOE, the national social
ministries, the Ministries of Social Action or equivalent agencies at the
provincial level, and NGOs;
(b)   development of selected methodologies and systems to monitor and
evaluate selected national and provincial social programs, including beneficiary
assessment surveys and monitoring of methods implemented by targeted social
programs; and
(c)   carrying out diagnostic evaluation of selected ongoing targeted social
programs in coordination with appropriate national and sectoral agencies.
During negotiations, it was confirmed that any SIEMIPRO activity on social
program evaluation using a methodology that includes public social
expenditures among its variables would be carried out in coordination with
DNPGS (para. 9.1(r)).
3.40 Dissemination and Transfer of Methodologies and Systems to National and
Provincial Agencies. The SIEMPRO unit in the SDS would disseminate the social
information, targeting and evaluation methods and systems, as well as provide technical
assistance, to appropriate national and counterpart provincial agencies. Specifically,
SIEMPRO would finance:
(a)   training programs and workshops for national and provincial agencies on
social management, including the application of the methodologies and systems
for targeting and monitoring and evaluation of social programs;



26
(b)   a demand-driven Technical Dissemination Plan (TDP) which would: (i)
establish small provincial SIEMPRO units (Unidades Ejecutoras Provinciales,
or UEPs) in the counterpart provincial agency to set up the social information
system and monitoring/evaluation or provincial social programs targeted to the
poor; and (ii) as needed, carry out monitoring and evaluation and/or other
technical studies related to social programs supported under Component A of
this Project. Through a flexible subcontracting mechanism based on demand,
the TDP would gradually transfer systems and methodologies and associated
training in the provinces. This mechanism would also be a flexible device for
assisting, when needed, technical studies required by programs being supported
under Component A of the Project. The operational procedures for the TDP are
explained in Chapter 4 and in Annex 7. The establishment of the TDP
mechanism was confirmed during negotiations (para 9. 1(t)).
(c)   promotion of the participation of NGOs in the process of monitoring and
evaluation of social programs;
(d)   the development and application of a social communication strategy to
disseminate the progress being achieved in improving the management and
transparency of public social resources; and
(e)   elaboration of an institutional plan to absorb SIEMPRO into the
permanent structure of SDS.
3.41 Institutional Strengthening and Management. The project would support the
establishment of a SIEMPRO unit in the SDS (Unidad Ejecutora Central, or UEC),
including a three-person group for social policy analysis that would make technical
inputs to the Social Cabinet. The preparation of plans and strategies to institutionalize
SIEMPRO in SDS' structure would be supported. Also, the preparation of the second
phase of SIEMPRO would be financed.
3.42  Environmental Impact. The project does not present major environmental risks,
and therefore an environmental rating of"C" applies.
4. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION
4.1.  The Ministry of Economy (MOE) would oversee the implementation of
Component A, drawing on the support of program managers from the MCE and the
MTSS. The SDS which is implementing PRODESO would be responsible for the
oversight of FOPAR (Component B) and SIEMPRO (Component C). The detailed
institutional arrangements for implementation are described below.



27
4.2.  The Ministry of Economy would be responsible for the execution and
coordination of Component A. At appraisal, the MOE provisionally designated the
Director of the National Directorate of Projects with International Organizations
(Direccion Nacional de Proyectos con Organizaciones Internacionales, DNPOI) as the
Bank's main interlocutor for this component. Agreement was reached during
negotiations that, as a condition of disbursement, the MOE would appoint a
Project Coordinator to supervise the implementation of Component A (para. 9.2
(a)). The principal functions of the Coordinator were discussed during appraisal and
draft terms of reference were sent to the Bank. In addition to a number of functions
related to ensuring compliance with specific loan conditionalities and reporting on the
selected programs, the Coordinator would manage the Special Account. ). The
Coordinator would also collaborate with the Budget Evaluation Department (Direccion
de Evaluacion Presupuestaria, DEP) of the Secretariat of Finance in the periodic
monitoring of the physical accomplishments of the selected programs (para. 3.6).
Agreement was also reached that the MOE would hire a Project Officer on or
before January 15, 1996 to assist the Coordinator in the daily operational tasks
(para. 9.1 (g). In addition, agreement was also reached during negotiations that
MTSS would hire by January 31, 1996, and retain until project completion, a
Project Manager to coordinate the technical assistance, as well as other Loan
administrative and reporting requirements for the Loan financing of the selected
employment programs (para. 9.1 (g)).
4.3   As previously mentioned, FOPAR and SIEMPRO are integral parts of a
Programa Participativo de Desarollo Social (PRODESO). The organizational chart of
PRODESO is shown in Annex 8. The internal institutional setting of FOPAR and
SIEMPRO is discussed in detail in the following sections. It is important to note that
the Unidad de Coordinacion Administrativo Financiera, (UCAF), within PRODESO
would carry out the financial, procurement, legal and other administrative support
services required for the implementation of FOPAR and SIEMPRO. The Coordinator
and staff of this unit would be financed under the budgets of FOPAR and SIEMPRO.
Because of the important financial management and control functions of this unit,
agreement was obtained during negotiations that SDS would maintain this unit
with appropriate staffmg including a Coordinator whose qualifications and
experience would be acceptable to the Bank.
4.4   FOPAR. During the pilot phase, FOPAR would be structured as part of the
PRODESO "special program" within the SDS. This scheme, used for other Bank-
financed projects in Argentina, would ensure sufficient autonomy and flexibility of
operation, and provide for a pilot phase prior to the institutionalization of any future
FOPAR activities.
4.5   The FOPAR institutional framework would be structured in three tiers. At the
central (federal) level there would be an autonomous Project Unit, acting as the head
office for the program, and assisted by an advisory committee, whose main role would
be to advise on strategic directions and policies of FOPAR. The Project Unit would



28
be headed by a National Coordinator reporting to the SDS Undersecretary of Social
Projects and would evolve to have about 25 professional staff. At the provincial level,
there would be a local office and a provincial council (Consejo Provincial
Participativo), created to assist in the targeting process within provinces. Up to ten
provincial offices with a staff of about 3-6 each would be established. A local council
would be established at the municipality level (Consejo Local de Desarrollo Social),
composed of local institutions and potential beneficiaries. It would become a forum for
local participation, focusing on needs assessment, project formulation, priority setting
and identification of poverty areas at the local level.
4.6   The internal functions of FOPAR would be comprised of programming,
promotion, project evaluation, monitoring and control, and administration and finance.
Provincial Offices would be responsible for promotion, and monitoring and control at
the local level. They would also coordinate the interaction with the provincial and
district councils and other entities at the local level.
4.7   The organizational structure and operational procedures of FOPAR were
reviewed during appraisal. Policies, structure and basic guidelines have been
documented in an Operational Manual, a draft of which was reviewed during appraisal
and found satisfactory by the Bank. A final draft of the Manual was reviewed by the
Bank during negotiations. The official issuance of the FOPAR Operation Manual is
a condition of disbursement (para. 9.2(d)). The National Coordinator, two line
managers and one regional manager had already been appointed by appraisal.
Confirmation of the establishment of a FOPAR Unit in SDS and the appointment
of all key staff (National Coordinator, two line managers, and the first provincial
coordinator) with terms of reference and qualifications satisfactory to the Bank is
a condition of disbursement (para. 9.2 (c)). At negotiations, assurances were
obtained that: (a) FOPAR would maintain a National Coordinator, as well as Line
and Provincial Coordinators with qualifications acceptable to the Bank ; and (b)
any substantive change in its organizational structure and Operational Manual
would require prior Bank approval (para. 9.1 (k)).
4.8   FOPAR would launch the program in two provinces before the end of 1995 and
would expand it progressively to the rest of the provinces in the northern region.
FOPAR would closely monitor the rate of expansion and the coverage at the district
level during the initial months of implementation, balancing the expectations which
would be created at the local level through promotion activities with FOPAR' capacity
for expansion. It was agreed during negotiations that provincial councils would
need to be established before any funds are disbursed for subprojects in the
provinces (para. 9.1 (1)).
4.9   FOPAR would approve grants for community-based subprojects following
procedures established in the Operational Manual. Subprojects for poor communities
would be approved directly by FOPAR. Meanwhile, proposals for deprived
neighborhoods would be declared eligible for financing by FOPAR, in accordance with



29
the standard solicitation forms for proposals. Whenever there is a resource constraint,
the final selection among eligible subprojects which have passed a technical appraisal
would be made by the provincial councils. FOPAR would enter into grant agreements
with representatives of beneficiaries organized into an executive committee (Nucleos de
Beneficiarios), specifying the obligations of the beneficiaries to complete the
subproject, and to implement it in accordance with specified procedures for
procurement, accounting and auditing. Model grant agreements have been reviewed
and found satisfactory. Agreement was obtained at negotiations that FOPAR
would submit for the Bank's no objection: (a) the rst five grant agreements for
subprojects, including their appraisal reports; (b) any subproject which does not
meet the eligibility criteria set forth in the Operational Manual; (c) the standard
solicitation forms for inviting subproject proposals for deprived neighborhoods in
provincial capitals; (d) the standard technical documents (letter of invitation,
terms of reference for proposals, the evaluation report, the recommendation for
award and the proposed contract) for the fiduciary arrangements for the micro-
enterprise revolving funds; and (e) a copy of each subproject summary sheet for
its ex-post review in a format acceptable to the Bank (para. 9.1 (m)). Because of
the pilot nature of FOPAR and the need for a tight monitoring of activities, a Mid-
Term review would be held no later than March 31, 1997 (para. 9.1 (w)).
4. 10 SIEMPRO. A SIEMPRO Unit (Unidad Ejecutora Central, or UEC) would be
created under the SDS Subsecretary of Social Projects (see Annex 8 for SDS and
SIEMPRO organization charts) as provided for in the PRODESO resolution. The UEC,
which would have about 23 staff, would consist of a General Coordination Department
and three subunits corresponding to the functions described in Chapter 3. The detailed
functions of each of these departments are described in the SIEMPRO Project
Document. The establishment of a SIEMPRO UEC with staff whose terms of
reference and qualifications are satisfactory to the Bank as reflected in the
SIEMPRO Project Document is a condition of disbursement (para. 9.2 (e)).
Agreement was obtained during negotiations that the Government would maintain
the SIEMPRO UEC Coordinator and staff with qualifications satisfactory to the
Bank.
4.11 At the provincial level, SIEMPRO would set up small executing units (Unidad
Ejecutora Provincial, UEP) in the Ministries of Social Action that would adhere to the
SIEMPRO program. It is estimated that about ten provinces would request the
SIEMPRO technical assistance in the next two years. As described in Chapter 3, the
UEPs would receive not more than US$200,000 assistance in the form of consultant
services and computer hardware/software. Provinces with unsatisfied basic needs
(NBI) of more than 25 percent would receive priority for this assistance (see Annex 7).
The SIEMPRO central unit would carry out diagnostic missions to selected provinces to
disseminate information on SIEMPRO objectives and missions, as well as review the
provincial institutional framework for social information generation and analysis.
Thereafter, the provincial participation in SIEMPRO would require two steps. First,
the SDS needs to receive a request from the Office of the Provincial Governor or the



30
Minister of Social Action (or equivalent agency) requesting the installation of
SIEMPRO (carta de adhesi6n). Second, a Subsidiary Agreement (Convenio de
Adhesi6n) would be signed between the SDS and the Ministry/corresponding
counterpart agency, detailing the resources that would be committed and the
implementation arrangements between SIEMPRO and the provincial agency. As of
April 1995, SDS had received letters from some provincial officials including those of
the Governor of Santiago del Estero and the Minister of Social Action in Misiones
requesting the start-up of SIEMPRO in those provinces. It was agreed during
negotiations that the draft subsidiary agreements (Convenio de Adhesion) for the
first two provinces joining SIEMPRO would be furnished to the Bank for its
review (para. 9.1(s)).
5. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN
A. Project Costs
5.1   The total project cost is estimated at US$417.9 million equivalent, including
taxes. The total cost of Component A (Priority Social and Income Support Programs)
is estimated at US$366.8 million, of which US$91.2 million would be foreign
exchange (25 percent of total component cost). This estimate reflects the 1995 budget
for three employment programs and one education program (Table 5.1), as well as an
assumption that the 1996 budgets for these, or other programs that may be selected,
would be similar to those of 1995. This estimate also includes an amount of US$5.3
million to finance the cost of consultant services and office goods and equipment for
the Ministry of Labor and the public social expenditure review, as well as for the
coordination of Component A in the Ministry of Finance.
5.2   The total cost for Component B (FOPAR) is estimated at US$36.7 million, of
which an estimated US$10.6 million would be foreign exchange (29 percent of total
cost), including price and physical contingencies. Contingencies are not applied to
subprojects under Component B since any changes in the cost of subprojects would be
compensated by the total number of subprojects. The total cost for Component C
(SIEMPRO) is estimated at US$14.4 million, of which US$3.6 million would be
foreign exchange (25 percent of total cost), including price and physical contingencies.
Foreign inflation rates are estimated at 2.6 percent over the period 1995-97, and local
inflation rates are estimated at 3 percent for 1995, and 2.6 percent for 1996-97. Table
5.1 summarizes the estimated costs by project component. Detailed cost tables are
shown in Annex 9.
5.3   Because of the special nature of this project (i.e., the greatest proportion of the
costs is actual budgetary reimbursement for existing social programs) estimated
contingencies are not significant. The estimated total project cost includes
contingencies of US$2.1 million equivalent (less than one percent of base costs).



31
Physical contingencies of US$0.4 million are for other goods and equipment under
Component B and Component C. Price contingencies (US$1.7 million equivalent)
reflect projected price increases for foreign costs for Components B and C.

B. Recurrent Costs and Project Sustainability
5.4      Component A  of the Project would not entail incremental recurrent costs, as
the programs to be financed are already under implementation. The main purpose of



32
this component is to sustain these ongoing programs during 1995 and 1996, at which
time Argentina is expected to have achieved the economic and fiscal adjustment that
would permit the Government to continue financing priority social expenditures.
Operational expenses under Components B and C, are less than one percent of the total
project cost. In the case of Component B, which is a pilot project, the recurrent cost
would be incremental only if the Government decides to convert the pilot operation to a
regular program after two years. In the case of Component C, there are plans to
institutionalize the SIEMPRO functions in the SDS, with the strategy and the timing of
this effort to be defined in the second SIEMPRO operation.
C. Financing Plan
5.5   The proposed fixed rate US Dollar single currency loan of US$152.0 million
would finance 36 percent of total project cost. The Government would finance the
remaining US$265.9 million equivalent or 64 percent of total project cost. Consistent
with the objective of protecting existing government social programs from further
budget cuts, the Bank share of financing for Component A is a modest 30 percent.
Since Components B and C are for pilot investments in a social fund and in poverty
analysis and program management, the Bank's share of planned spending is
correspondingly higher, at over 70 percent. Table 5.2 below summarizes the project's
financing plan. The loan would be made to the MOE which would make the funds
available to executing agencies for the implementation of the project. Also, assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the MOE would provide the counterpart
funds needed by Components B and C up to an estimated amount of US$13
million during project implementation (para. 9. l(u)). A PPF of US$1.5 million
granted for the preparation of Components B and C would be refinanced under the
Loan.

5.6   Argentina is eligible for single currency loan terms under the expanded SCL
program. Including the proposed loan, Argentina has selected single currency loan
terms for US$652 million (43-47 percent) of its expected FY96 borrowing program of
US$1.4-1.5 billion.



33
6. PROCUREMENT, DISBURSEMENTS AND AUDITS
A. Procurement
6.1   Under Component A, the Bank would finance eligible expenditures for small
civil works and remuneration of short term employees under education and employment
programs following applicable procurement national laws: the Financial Management
Law (Ley de Administraci6n Financiera), which supersedes the General Accounting
Law (Ley de Contabilidad) and the Public Works Law (Ley de Obras PWiblicas). The
procedures provided under this legal framework have been deemed acceptable under the
Bank's Guidelines (January 1995). Procurement of computer equipment not included in
the protected programs would be carried out through international competitive bidding
following the Bank's Guidelines (January 1995).
6.2  For this Component, the Bank would finance a time-slice (US$115.9 million
equivalent) of the national budget allocated for civil works, remuneration for temporary
fixed-term staff and training and stipends of the selected programs. Also, consulting
services and computer equipment for institutional strengthening for the employment
programs and the execution of a public social expenditure review would be financed
under this component directly from the Loan's proceeds. Procurement under
Components B and C would consist of purchase of office equipment and the provision
of consulting services.
6.3   Due to the special characteristics of Component A, and the need to ensure rapid
and timely disbursements, IBRD-financed procurement of goods would concentrate on
contracts awarded under procedures acceptable under the Bank Guidelines (1995).
Contracts for civil works would be awarded on the basis of comparison of price
quotations. The computers and office equipment for Institutional Development under
Component A would be procured following ICB procedures in accordance with the
Bank's Procurement Guidelines (January 1995). A large portion of the loan would not
involve procurement as the Bank would reimburse the Government for remuneration,
training and stipends paid to qualified beneficiaries of the employment programs upon
submission of acceptable payment certificates. The technical assistance for the
employment programs, the public social expenditure review and the coordination of
Component A would be contracted following the Guidelines for Use of Consultants by
World Bank borrowers (August 1981). External auditing, as well as DEP's monitoring
reports on the social programs would help ensure that these procedures are followed.
6.4   Loan proceeds would be used to reimburse the budget expenditures for the
infrastructure component of the Plan Social Educativo (PSE). These are small
rehabilitation works contracted individually by implementing agencies. The national
coordinating unit for this program in the Ministry of Education in Buenos Aires has the
capability of providing the Bank with acceptable documentation supporting actual
payments made for these contracts.



34
6.5  In cases of decentralized social programs which provide services through NGOs
or municipal or provincial governments (PROAS/PRENO, APRENDER, PEP and
FORESTAR), a fraction of the cost of such services would be financed directly. These
programs have easily measurable outputs and are executed in a cost-effective manner.
6.6   Under Component A, Civil Works for the PSE to be financed by the proposed
loan would involve the rehabilitation and construction of classrooms for schools spread
over the country. The cost of each contract would not exceed US$120,000 as a
condition of eligibility for PSE financing, up to an aggregate amount of about US$93.8
million (Table 6.1), of which approximately US$39.5 million equivalent would be
financed by the Bank. The contracts for these works are currently being awarded on the
basis of local shopping (comparison of at least three price quotations), which is
acceptable to the Bank given the small size of each contract.
6.7   Textbooks under PSE would be subject to retroactive financing in the
percentages and total amount specified under paragraph 6.15 below.
6.8   The Institutional Development (or technical assistance) part of Component A
(for the employment programs, the public social expenditure review and the
coordination of Component A) for a total amount of US$5.3 million equivalent (3.8
million for consulting services and 1.5 million for computers) would be financed
directly from the loan account and contracted in accordance with Guidelines on the Use
of Consultants by Mbrld Bank Borrowers and by the Wbrld Bank as Executing Agency
(August 1981).
6.9   Under Components B and C, procurement would be principally for office
equipment, including computers and software's, and the contracting of technical
assistance at the central level; and some procurement to be carried out by the
Subprojects, for which grants are provided under FOPAR (Component B).
6.10 Goods would include photocopiers, personal computer hardware and software,
and other office equipment and supplies for a total amount of US$1.5 million
equivalent, out of which the Bank would finance US$0.6 million. These equipment
would be procured by national or international shopping.
6.11 Consulting services for a total amount of US$17.4 million equivalent, out of
which the Bank would finance US$12.8 million, and training and workshops for a total
amount of US$3.5 million equivalent with US$2.7 million to be financed by the Bank,
would be contracted following the principles set out under paragraphs 6.13 and 6.17
below.

6.12 Subprojects would carry out their own procurement under the supervision of
FOPAR with due concern for economy and efficiency in their implementation. Most
of the subprojects would be undertaken by the communities themselves using labor
intensive methods. Projects costing less than US$50,000 up to an aggregate amount of
US$ 22.5 million equivalent would be implemented directly by the communities,
assisted by NGOs, using voluntary work and allowing very small contracts when
needed. The grant agreement for each subproject would specify the obligations of the
communities, including procedures for procurement during normal supervision of
subprojects. Civil works and goods for subprojects costing US$50,000 or more but
less than US$100,000 equivalent, would be contracted to local small contractors or
suppliers by comparison of at least three price quotations or national shopping,
respectively. No individual subprojects' contract would cost above US$100,000
equivalent. The average subproject cost will be of US$10,000 equivalent. It is
expected that 90 percent of the total number of subprojects, representing about 80
percent of the total value of subprojects financed, would be executed directly by the
communities.
6.13  Technical assistance, training and studies under Components B and C would
be carried out by individual consultants or consulting firms contracted in accordance
with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Vlbrld Bank Borrowers and by the Wrld
Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). A standard invitation package would be
used, including the Bank's standard form of contract for consultants services and model
letter of invitation.
6.14 Other costs not involving procurement. Approximately 42 percent of the
proposed projects costs or US$185.0 million equivalent would not involve procurement.
These costs include training and stipends for trainees under the PRONAPAS program
and remuneration for temporary fixed-term staff under the PROAS/PRENO, PEP and
FORESTAR programs.
6.15 Textbooks under Plan Social Educativo in Component A would be subject to
retroactive financing. A contract for a total of US$15.9 million equivalent was placed
directly with the editors in observance copyright laws in effect in Argentina which
applied for the selected books. The Bank has agreed to reimburse the Government for
payments for textbooks made after March 15, 1995, up to an amount of US$6.2 million
equivalent. The process for contract awards was reviewed by the Bank's mission during
appraisal and found to be acceptable for Bank's financing. In spite of having purchased
the books directly in obeyance of copyright legislation, the Ministry of Education
(MOE) aggregated all requests from individual schools across the country and obtained
wholesale prices in average 35 to 50 percent below regular cover prices.
6.16 Review of Procurement. Under Component A, prior review by the Bank
would be carried out for the technical assistance contracts and for the ICB for the
computer and office equipment for the Institutional Development component; the award
of civil works contracts under Plan Social Educativo would be subject to sample post



37
review. Under Components B and C, for FOPAR, the first five grants for subprojects
(and any subproject which does not correspond to the types established in the
Operational Manual) would be subject to the Bank's prior review. The Bank would
review ex-post, on a selective basis, contracts and bid evaluation for goods and civil
works awarded under other procedures not subject to prior review by the Bank.
6.17 The Bank would review documentation for consulting services to be financed
under the Loan. Bank prior review would be required for: (a) all contracts for
consulting firms of US$100,000 equivalent or above; (b) all contracts with individuals
(new or renewals) costing more than US$50,000 equivalent in aggregate during the
calendar year. For consultant contracts with firms that cost less than US$100,000
equivalent and for individuals that cost less than US$50,000 equivalent, prior review by
the Bank would only cover the corresponding terms of reference and the short list. This
exception shall not apply to: (a) single source selection of consulting firms; (b)
assignments of a critical nature as reasonably determined by the Bank; (c) amendments
to contracts for the employment of consulting firms raising the contract value to
US$100,000 equivalent or above; (d) amendments to contracts for the employment of
individual consultants raising the contract value to US$50,000 equivalent or above; and
(e) key staff positions of the project units in FOPAR and SIEMPRO (Table 6.2).
B. Disbursements
6.18 The proceeds of the proposed loan are expected to be disbursed in accordance
with the schedule shown in Thble 6.3 over a period of two and a half years (i.e., three
IMRD fiscal years), with the target of disbursing more than 30 percent of these
resources before end-1995. Because the implementation period for both Components B
and C is somewhat longer than for Component A, the project completion date is
estimated to be December 31, 1997 and Loan closing date is June 30, 1998.
6.19 Retroactive financing of up to 20 percent of the loan or US$30.4 million
equivalent would be available, including US$28.4 for Component A to help cover
eligible expenditures for textbooks, civil works, technical assistance and studies,
training and stipends incurred on or after March 15, 1995. For Component C,
retroactive financing of up to US$2.0 million would be provided for eligible
expenditures for consultant services, goods and equipment, and training and workshops
incurred on or after June 12, 1995. In both cases, retroactive financing would be
allowed on or after the above mentioned dates and, in any event, only up to 12 months
prior to loan signing.

6.20 Table.6.4 shows disbursement allocations. Disbursements would be made against
the following categories of expenditures:



39
(a)   For Component A: Disbursement percentages would be as follows for
each category: 75 percent of expenditures for civil works; 75 percent for
textbooks; 100 percent of the Institutional Development consulting services and
computer and office equipment; and 75 percent for remuneration of temporary
fixed-term staff under PROAS/PRENO and FORESTAR programs and for the
stipends and training costs under PRONAPAS.
(b)   For Components B and C: 40 percent of expenditures for goods; 80
percent of the expenditures for training and workshops and for consulting
services; and 70 percent of the grants for subprojects.
6.21  Wlthdrawal applications for consultant services with a contract value of
US$100,000 or more and US$50,000 or more for the employment of firms and
individual consultants, respectively, as well as the special cases noted in para. 6.14
would be supported by full documentation. Additionally, the first five grants by
FOPAR for subprojects would be fully documented. Disbursements would be made on
the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) against expenditures for contracts for:
(a) all civil works; (b) contracts of less than US$100,000 and US$50,000 for the
employment of consulting firms and individual consultants, respectively; (c) all
subprojects (consistent with the FOPAR Operational Manual) other than the first five
grants; and (d) disbursements against eligible expenditures not undertaken by contract.
Supporting documentation for these would be retained and maintained by the
Coordinating Unit in each program and would be available for periodic review by the
Bank.
6.22 Authorities responsible for coordinating each Component would be responsible
for ensuring that requests for reimbursement are made for eligible expenditures. These
requests can only be made when the coordinating units for each program has incurred
the expense and has sufficient supporting documentation (contracts, invoices, payment
orders, etc.). For Component A, the Coordinator and/or his alternate would prepare an
SOE at regular intervals (monthly) for presentation to the Secretary of Finance in the
MOE. For Components B and C, the coordinating units at FOPAR and SIEMPRO
would be able to draw on the Loan account directly.
6.23 Special Account . Two Special Accounts would be opened for this project in the
Banco de la Naci6n: (a) a Special Account of US$20.0 million for Component A to be
managed by the Ministry of Economy, and (b) a Special Account of US$5.0 million
(with an initial deposit of US$3.0 million) for Components B and C, to be managed by
designated authorities in SDS, FOPAR and SIEMPRO. Normal documentation
requirements apply, except that in addition, a copy of the Bank statement from the
institution holding the account detailing the transactions made and reconciled by the
MCE and by SDS/ FOPAR/SIEMPRO, respectively, would accompany each
replenishment request.

C. Audits
6.24 All executing agencies would maintain records and account adequate to reflect,
in accordance with sound accounting practices, the resources and expenditures in
connection with the execution of the programs. These records would reflect the
resources and expenditure in connection with the execution of the entire program.
During negotiations, it was agreed that the MCE and the MTSS for the loan-
fimanced programs, as well as SDS for FOPAR and SIEMPRO, would: (a) have
the records and accounts for each fiscal year audited by independent and qualified
auditors, with a separate opinion provided for SOEs, using generally accepted
auditing standards and procedures; (b) furnish to the Bank no later than six
months after the end of each fiscal year, a certified copy of the agreed audit
reports; and (c) furnish to the Bank such other information concerning the records
and accounts as well as the audit as the Bank would from time to time reasonably
request (para. 9. l(i)). For all expenditures with respect to which withdrawal from the
Loan Account were made on the basis of SOEs, and all expenditures with respect to
which withdrawals were made from the Special Account, the coordinating units for the
programs would upon request provide: (a) to MOE all records and accounts necessary
to allow the timely performance of its obligations and (b) to the independent auditor,
both the records and the supporting documentation.
6.25 The project's accounts would be available for inspection by the Bank. The
annual audit reports would include, inter alia: (a) an audit of the project; (b) an
auditor's opinion on the eligibility of expenses submitted through Statement of
Expenditures (SOEs); (c) opinions on compliance with the financial-managerial
covenants in the Loan Agreement; (d) an audit of the special account; (e) a
management letter; and (f) a disclosure of the audit procedures utilized. The audit
would be performed by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The terms of
reference for the annual audits would be submitted to the Bank for its consideration. It
was confirmed at negotiations that FOPAR would undertake and forward to the
Bank annual ex-post evaluations of sample grants for subprojects based on terms
of reference acceptable to the Bank (para. 9. l(n)).
7. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
7.1   Progress Reporting. For Component A, the Coordinator in the Secretariat of
Finance would send a semi-annual progress report to the World Bank based on
information provided by the implementing agencies and the DEP. DEP would prepare
periodic information on the status of each of the protected programs reflecting, among
others, accomplishment of program targets and financial performance. Reporting
procedures have been agreed also for Components B and C. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that such semi-annual progress reports would be



42
furnished to the Bank by March 31 and September 30 of each year of project
execution (para. 9.1 (h)).
7.2   Program Evaluation. Each of the protected programs would be evaluated
during the life of the project. Evaluations would focus on the effectiveness of the
programs in targeting the poor and unemployed: the internal efficiency of service
delivery; the impact of programs on the income and welfare levels of the intended
beneficiaries; and recommendations to improve targeting and efficiency. The
evaluation studies would be managed by SIEMPRO, as part of its mandate to evaluate
social programs in Argentina. SIEMPRO would execute letters of agreements (cartas
de adhesion) with the program implementing agencies for the carrying of the evaluation
studies. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the terms of reference
for the rst two evaluations would be sent to the Bank for its review and
comments by January 15, 1996; the rust two evaluation studies carried out on the
basis of said terms of reference would be sent to the Bank by May 31, 1996; and
the evaluation studies of the remaining programs would be sent to the Bank by
December 31, 1996 (para. 9.1 (v)). The timetable for these evaluation studies are also
included in the SIEMPRO matrix.
7.3   As discussed earlier (para 3.9), the DNPGS of the MCE would carry out a
critical review of federal social spending for the "targeted" programs amounting to
nearly US$4 billion in 1995. The review would analyze the efficiency of these
programs and would identify ways to improve their cost-effectiveness. The results of
the first stage of this would be sent to the Bank by May 31, 1996.
7.4   World Bank Review Missions. In general, Bank missions would focus on the
review of the quarterly budget release for the social programs supported under Part A
of the Project, the field implementation of the pilot social investment fund under
Component B, and the process and output results summarized in the Matrix of Key
Activities under Component C. Special attention would be paid to monitoring the
effectiveness of targeting to the poor, as well as the achievement of physical
attainment of the different social programs. The supervision team would be carefully
planned, involving staff and consultants with the necessary skills and experience for
each of the supported social programs. It is estimated that 50 staff weeks each would
be required for supervision in FY96 and FY97. This estimate takes into account the
multi-sectoral nature of this operation, the institutional development aspects, and the
procurement arrangements for some of the project activities.
7.5  In relation to Component A, the following actions would be implemented
during World Bank review missions:
(a) December 1995: to review the actual spending for the protected programs for
the first three quarters of 1995 and to agree on the composition and budget for the
social programs to be financed from the Bank loan in 1996;



43
(b) February 1996: to review the actual spending results for the protected programs
for 1995;
(c) August 1996: to review actual spending for the first two quarters of 1996; to
discuss the results of the first stage of the public social expenditure review and of
the first two evaluation studies on the protected programs; and
(d) February 1997: to review the actual spending results for 1996; to discuss the
results of the succeeding stages of the public social expenditure review and of the
evaluation studies on the remaining protected programs.
7.6   Mid-Term Review. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that a
Mid-Term Review would be held for Components B and C no later than March
31, 1997. It was also confwrmed that for Component C, the Mid-Term Review
would officially launch the start of preparation of the second phase of the
SIEMPRO program (para. 9.1 (w)).
8. BENEFITS AND RISKS
8.1   The proposed project would help to reduce the social costs associated with
Argentina's current economic crisis and related adjustment program. It would preserve
critical social services for about three million Argentines currently living in poverty or
facing unemployment. Of these, about 850,000 children and pregnant women would be
vaccinated and over half a million persons protected from Chagas Disease; and about
170,000 poor persons would receive supplementary feeding. Nearly 2 million students
would benefit from the Plan Social Educativo. The project would provide employment
opportunities and develop the skills of about 200,000 currently unemployed persons,
and would help improve the productive capacity of thousands of poor rural families.
The pilot phase of the FOPAR would also help generate a new model for financing
grass-roots poverty reduction activities using community participation. In the next two
years, FOPAR will benefit about 70,000 families in the poorest districts of Northern
Argentina.
8.2   The medium-term institutional development benefits of this operation include the
improvement of the targeting, monitoring and evaluation of social programs through the
technical assistance to SIEMPRO, strengthening of MOE's DEP in monitoring the
physical and financial accomplishments of the protected programs, and enhancement of
the Government's capacity to review social expenditure efficiency. At the same time,
the project would assist in building federal and provincial capacity for social policy
analysis and formulation and for monitoring and evaluating social programs.
8.3   The main risks facing the project are: (a) further budget cuts and (b) slow
disbursement as a result of lack of local capacity and insufficient coordination between



44
the Ministry of Economy, SDS and the implementing agencies. The Bank and the IDB
are working closely with the Ministry of Economy to safeguard the budget of the
targeted social programs. Project conditionality related to public social spending in
1995-96 would reduce this risk. The second risk would be mitigated by concentrating
on a small number of important social programs and by giving priority to
implementing agencies with a demonstrated record of strong program management.
Covenants for appointing the project coordinator and the hiring of the project officer
and sub-coordinator in the Ministry of Labor will help to ensure that an accountable
management team is in place at the outset of the project. Procurement and
disbursement procedures have been designed to expedite implementation and
reimbursement.
8.4   With respect to the loan terms, the Government expects the US dollar single
currency loan terms to facilitate improved debt management, and the fixed interest rate
to protect against possible market interest rate increases after the loan is fully
disbursed.
9. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
9.1    The following agreements were reached or assurances were given at
negotiations:
Component A: Critical Social Programs and Support
(a)    By no later than December 15, 1995, the Government would furnish the
Bank a report on the physical and financial performance of the protected
programs for the first semester of the year (para. 3.8);
(b)    The Government would ensure that its expenditures in 1995 for the
protected social programs would amount in the aggregate to at least US$300
million and would inform the Bank in writing, no later than February 28, 1996
of the actual level and composition of 1995 expenditures for the protected
programs (para. 3.8);
(c)   By December 15, 1995, the Government would furnish to the Bank
evidence that it has budgeted sufficient funds for the protected programs in 1996
in an aggregate amount at least equal to US$300 million (para. 3.8);
(d)   By no later than December 15, 1995, the Government would provide the
Bank with a proposal, acceptable to the Bank, describing the size and
composition of the selected employment programs to be financed by the Loan

SOCIAL PROTECTION LOAN
LETTER OF SOCIAL POLICY
October 10, 1995
Mr. James D. Wolfensohn
President
The World Bank
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn:
1.    This letter of social policy describes the Argentine Governmnent's reform program
and the various steps necessary for reforming the social sectors. To achieve these
objectives and implement them in their entirely, the Government is requesting financial
and technical assistance from IBRD.
I. The Macroeconomic Framework
2.    Price stability and sustained growth remain the centerpieces of the
Government's economic program. The Goverrunent has made important progress
since 1991. To eliminate fiscal deficits that were fueling inflation, the Government
initiated profound structural reforms. As a result, monthly price increases dropped
from over 30 percent at the beginning of 1991 to international rates in the second
semester of 1993, inflation during 1994 was only 3.9 percent
3.    By laying the basis for price stability, the Government has charted an agenda
for the future with the following objectives:
*     the consolidation of stability through strict compliance with Law No.23928 of
March 27, 1991 (the Convertibility Law), the preservation of fiscal equilibrium
/      and the operation of a market economy with deregulated and unrestricted
competitive.markets, and regulation by the state of non-competitive markets;
<   *  the strengthening of economic growth (annual GDP growth rates increased
from 0.1 percent in 1990 to an average of 7.7 percent during 1991-1994) through
; * L increased levels of savings, investment, productivity, privatization of public



49                      Annex I
enterprises, private sector development and exports, and an intensification of
trade, financial and technological integration of the Argentina economy into
world markets; and
the achievement of higher levels of employment and a more equitable
distribution of income, both at a personal and regional basis, through
consolidation of economic stability and growth, substantially increased public
investment in human resource development and social services, and measures to
promote regional development
4.    Sustained economic recovery and improvements in welfare will continue to
be achieved by undertaking lasting structural reforms in the public sector,
improvement in national savings, and policy reforms that would continue to remote
private sector activitv through gains in productivity, lower domestic taxes, and
factor market improvements. To ensure that the private sector remains the leading
expansionary force in the economy, the Government is committed to maintain
flexible and open markets free of domestic regulations and major external trade
barriers, and with a strong financial sector to improve intermediation. The
Government's program of market reforms covers the following areas:
(a) Open market economy The government has totally eliminated
controls on prices, wages, interest rates, and capital flows as well as a complex
network of subsidies and implicit taxes. The Government is committed to maintain
such policies. Additionally, to facilitate more rational allocation of resources in the
economy, and improve international competitiveness through the reduction of
production costs and improvement of incentives for productive investment, the
Government is committed to promote structural reforms by introducing and
supporting legislation for: (a) liberalizing labor markets; (b) streamlining
bankruptcy legislation; (c) reforming the health insurance cooperatives; and (d)
encouraging the reform of provincial finances, including the reduction of inefficient
taxes.
(b) Trade Liberalization: The Government has made rapid strides
towards opening the economy, in terms of flows of trade, capital, and technology.
The import tariff structure has been simplified and the average tariff rate was
lowered to approximately 14 percent To the extent that additional tariffs were
reimposed for fiscal reasons, it is the govermnent's intention to remove them as soon
as practicable. Export taxes have been nearly eliminated, and most quantitative
I l& - restrictions and other procedures that slowed the entry of trade, capital and



50                       Annex 1
2lir:lo  ale  conzomia
y   4ar y  eetLCOca ea2 io06
technology have been removed. The Government will keep the economy open to
international competition and will keep Argentina's antidumping provisions in line
with the respective GATT code. Moreover, the MERCOSLTR treaty came into full
effect in January 1995... As specified in the Treaty of Asunci6n, the Government
eliminated most intra-MERCOSUR tariffs, dropped all other intra-market trade
barriers, and established a common external tariff covering 85 percent of the
positions in January 1995.
(c) Financial Sector Reform: Financial sector reforms have been
aimed at increasing financial deepening and the efficiency of financial
intermediation. Following interest rate liberalization in 1987 and the elimination of
directed credit by the Central Bank, the Government's strategy has been to increase
depositor and investor confidence. Under the Convertibility Law price
stabilization, liberalized interest rates, and tighter regulation and enforcement of
liquidity, capital adequacy and provisioning requirements were the chief reforms
that permitted financial deepening (M4) to increase from a low of 7 percent of GDP
in 1990 to 19 percent in 1994. Similarly, capital market reforms, including the
elimination of transaction taxes on securities trading and improvements in the
regulation of public offerings, encouraged the development of a major emerging
market Banks and non-bank corporations raised US$9.9 billion in equity issues and
registered US$6.5 billion in bond issues during 1990-1993. The Government is
committed to maintain liberalized interest rates and to refrain from directing credit
allocation of financial institutions, and to further strengthen banking supervision.
5.    In the aftermath of the Mexico crisis, the Government's immediate aim is to
sustain past achievements through deepening reforms. The Government has
already taken far-reaching steps that will consolidate stability and deflect the
spillover effects from the crisis. Foremost among these changes are a deepening of
public and financial sector reforms. These will strengthen confidence in sovereign
debt, the financial sector, and the sustainability of the Convertibility Law. The
following sections discuss these reforms as well as upcoming steps of the reform
program.
II. Social Policy
6.    The objectives of the Government's social policy are to satisfy the basic needs of
,,,, the population and guarantee equality of opportunity. The purpose of its active social
policy is to provide opportunities for the population to participate in the process of



51
Annex 1
2l0nz2o d0 6     'e neamOz
y (ga y e9ce'       a  QYi e ficod
economic development and overcome the various causes and manifestations of poverty.
A context for this policy is provided by the proposals and targets contained in the 1995-
99 Five-Year Plan.
7.    Economic growth is essential for social development and the elimination of
poverty, but it will fall short of this goal unless it is accompanied by appropriate active
social policies. Consequently, the Government has allocated considerable resources over
recent years in order to deal with the needs of the underprivileged and support the
social sectors. Nevertheless, such policies have often achieved meager results, and the
actions taken have been supply-based, fragmented and erratic, and characterized by
fregmentation and a lack of transparency.
8.    In present-day Argentina (as in most countries in the region that are experiencing
similar problems of structural modernization), overcoming these difficulties requires
abandoning the traditional approach of state intervention, adopting instead a new
model of administration that is demand-oriented and combines effectiveness, efficiency,
transparency and participation.
9.    Consequently, the Government - through the Office of the Secretary for Social
Development - has decided to prepare the way for the gradual establishment of a
'National System of Social Policies," so that, in the medium term, a demand-oriented
management model can be introduced, guaranteeing a necessary degree of participation
and efficiency to achieve a measurable and quantifiable impact, thus producing
substantial improvements in the standard of living and eliminating poverty.
10.   In this process, the Government has the key role of setting policy, and regulating
and coordinating the functions of the various stakeholders while simultaneously
insisting on justice and equity for all.  The criteria guiding its actions are
decentralization, clear targeting, integrated approach, and participation.
11.   Achieving increased efficiency is a function of having clear focus and responding
to social demand. Consequently, consistent criteria must be applied to the allocation of
resources in all administrative areas, the setting of precise goals, and appropriate levels
v /7 of control. It is therefore essential that all the agencies involved should be provided
with the same mechanisms for monitoring and controL  The National Government
allocates resources according to its priorities, transferring them to the Provinces when
necessary and monitoring their impact in the social sphere.

e/J%nt4ao  We  &conomia
y    LSUta4 y cyeticeo6 CFidco6
12.   Although the National Government must not relinquish its fundamental
responsibilities, the principle to be applied is that the social agencies must operate as
links among individuals, among the organizations themselves, and between the
community and the Govermment For this reason, interaction between Government,
NGOs and municipalities is essential for the development of social policy, and must
increase.
13.   Social programs must be defined in terms of their objectives and targets, and
even though they are based on differing methodologies, they must include a consistent
approach to evaluating results. Evaluation as an ongoing process in the design and
implementation of programs is essential for achieving government objectives and
ensuring that resources are efficiently used. Thus, evaluation - provided that it is
correctly defined in terms of time, actors and processes - is one of the basic tools of the
State and society for guaranteeing effective social policy.
14.   The Government has called for an inventory of Targeted Social Programs that
would indicate the degree of each program's financial execution and physical targets.
This inventory will be based on data from the SIDIF (Integrated Financial Information
System) operated by the Office of the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretaria de Hacienda).
15.   The Social Cabinet (Gabinete Social) comprises officials from all agencies with a
direct or indirect responsibility for social affairs, and entrusted with the use of their own
funds. Consequently, the Social Cabinet has called upon the National Auditing office
(Sindicatura General de la Naci6n) to audit the programs relating to employment, food
and the activities of FONAVLI so that the principles applied by the various authorities
can be made uniform and the findings can be disseminated. This instrument serves to
reassert the full powers of the federal supervisory agencies over certain items of
discretionary funding.
III. The Development of Human Capital
A.    Public Social Spending
16.   Since 1991, public social spending has acquired considerable importance relative
to other types of public spending. This resulted from the reform of the State and the
transfer of functions that could be delegated to others so that the State could concentrate
on those activities assigned to it under the Constitution and relating to administrative
management and the application of resources to the social sectors. The fact that public
/k     social spending has increased while public spending in general has declined is evidence



53                       Annex I
AS(6nilhzo dc/e Tcanomla
y (9a_ y o7etziceoi4 etfj&eo
of the priority accorded to it by the Government Economic reorganization, GDP
growth, and more efficient tax collection have produced the resources necessary for
achieving these objectives. Nevertheless, the mere availability of financing does not
guarantee its efficient use, and therefore constant efforts must be made - in line with
clearly established principles - to provide guidance for all the institutional actors
involved in policy making and implementation.
17.   Ever since it was established, the Office of the Secretary for Economic Planning
(Secretaria de Programaci6n Econ6mica) of the Ministry of the Economy and Public
Works and Services has undertaken studies relating to public spending. These studies
show that social spending has considerably increased vis-a-vis other forms of public
spending, rising from 45% of total expenditures in 1980-83 to 65% in 1993-95. Its share
of GDP increased from 14% in the former period to 18% over the last three years. A
major component in public social spending is social security (which includes social
insurance, social facilities, unemployment insurance and dependency allowances), and
it has increased in recent years. In 1995 it accounted for more than half of public social
spending and 10.4% of GDP. Health, culture and education are the most important
items within the social sectors. Spending on health rose from 1.2% of GDP in 1980-83 to
1.7% in 1993-95, while spending on culture and education increased from about 3% of
GDP at the beginning of the 1980s to 3.6% in 1995. Social welfare has maintained its
share over recent years, despite a few fluctuations, while growth in other urban services
and in labor has been comparatively large, especially since employment programs
began to be implemented in 1993.
18.   The need to institutionalize the study of such issues led to the establishment in
mid-August 1994 in the Office of the Secretary for Economic Planring (Secretaria de
Programaci6n Econ6mica) of the National Directorate for the Programing of Social
Expenditure (Direcci6n Nacional de Programaci6n del Gasto Social), the Directorate for
Consolidated Public Spending (Direcci6n del Gasto Publico Consolidado), and the
Directorate for Studies on Living Standards and Poverty (Direcci6n de Estudios sobre
Niveles de Vida y Pobreza). The National Directorate reports directly to the Office of
the Secretary for Economic Planning and its main purposes are to evaluate and prepare
programs relating to consolidated public spending policies, their financing and their
impact on the population, and also to prepare diagnostic and monitoring studies on
living standards, such studies providing a framework for social and economic policy.
A  {    Since the Government is aware that there is no direct correlation between current levels
/of spending and the services provided, it is imperative to increase the efficiency and
effectiveness of programs and improve the standard of monitoring.

B.    Targeted Programs
19.   In order to reduce the social costs of fiscal adjustment, the National Government
intends to maintain its spending on certain social programs for the poorest members of
the population at apptopriate levels. A "basket" of social welfare programs has been
selected from among those financed by the National Government, which will keep its
spending on these up to a suitable level during the adjustment period. Similarly,
immediate action will be taken to improve these programs, with support from the Inter-
American Development Bank.
20.   Through the Office of the Secretary for Social Development (Secretaria de
Desarrollo Social), the National Government is formulating a Social Food Plan (Plan
Social Alimentario) to establish national policy on food assistance and identify
mechanisms for implementing policy, with a view to increasing equity, efficiency and
transparency in the use of resources.
21.   As part of the anti-poverty policy being promoted by the Office of the Secretaiy
for Social Development, it will support integrated and participatory projects targeted to
poor areas and to vulnerable groups. To this end, the establishment of a Participatory
Fund for Social Investment (Fondo Participativo de Inversi6n Social) was identified as a
priority need for supporting those groups living in extreme poverty. Its purpose is to
produce social investment projects for areas and municipalities where there is extreme
poverty, targeting these to households with high levels of unmet basic needs, thus
dealing with the community's urgent needs and improving the quality of life of the
most vulnerable groups. The Fund will provide support in the form of financial
resources, technical assistance and training in the fields of health, nutrition, education,
environmental sanitation, housing, and employment, among others.
22    It is essential that the process of social planning should include monitoring tools
that reach out to all those involved in social spending. Each Province is free to set its
own social investment priorities, but the National Government is also entitled to set
priorities and play an active role in allocating expenditures. In this way, the State's
social resources both combine with and encourage the financial efforts of the various
Provinces in meeting the needs of critical areas. The need to set up an information
system to coordinate the efforts of all stakeholders in social policy, while disseminating
,z1    basic data on which they can base their decision-making, has provided the motivation
for establishing SIEMPRO  (Sistema de Informacion, Evaluaci6n y Monitoreo de
Programas Sociales; System  of Information, Evaluation and Monitoring of Social
Programs), which is operated by the Office of the Secretary for Social Development Its
1 14.

purpose is to develop a national information base, as well as training, monitoring and
ongoing evaluation system for targeted Social Programs. The following are the main
aims of SIEMPRO:
-     establish an information system relating to social groups affected by poverty that
will make it possible to improve the formulation of programs and identify new social
needs and problems;
-     improve the management of social programs by strengthening the institutional
capacity of some provinces, thus contributing to bring about changes in the "culture'
and practices of the State;
-     establish a monitoring and evaluation network for targeted social programs, at
the national and provincial levels;
-     develop a National System  of Training and Technical Assistance for the
Management of Social Policies which would strengthen central units and  various
relevant agencies, to promote the adoption of new systems for managing anti-poverty
policies.
IV. Employment Policies
23.   Since mid-1992, the Government has been developing a set of policies for
promoting job creation and establishing an integrated system of unemployment
allowances that will cover the basic needs of those persons temporarily unemployed.
These programs are financed by the 1.5% levy on payroll established under the 1991
National Employment Law (Law No. 24013), which also created the National
Employment Fund.
24.   The National Government has been greatly concerned over unemployment and
is therefore making considerable efforts to intensify and diversify its activities and
programs so as to adapt them to the various needs of those affected.
25.   As the programs are developed, the necessary changes are being introduced to
make their management and administration more efficient - and transparent
Nevertheless, greater efforts must be devoted to reducing the costs of programs,
targeting them more precisely, and improving the mechanisms for evaluation and
inspection.

26.   A major objective is to enhance the social impact and effectiveness of programs
promoting employment, targeting them more accurately toward those groups within
the community that encounter the greatest difficulties in entering the labor force.
Resource allocation must be improved, making it better and more efficient, giving
priority to those programs with the greatest social impact, and improving their
implementation. The power to reallocate resources on a more rational basis will provide
for greater flexibility in responding to changes in the labor market and in taldng
effective action to reduce any negative repercussions. The actions taken will simplify
programs and reduce their cost, the purpose being to increase the number of
beneficiaries covered.
27.   Earlier labor legislation hadthe effect of increasing labor costs and limiting the
demand for labor. Faced with this situation, the Government has undertaken an
accelerated process of reform in order to reduce labor costs, create jobs, and improve
human capital, preparing it for the demands of a more competitive market
V. World Bank Stupport
28.   The above presentation demonstrates the depth of the Government's overall
public sector and social sector reform programs. The Government believes that financial
assistance from the World Bank is essential to implement improvements in social sector
programs.

SOME PROTECTED SOCIAL PROGRAMS (1995) -
WITHOUT BANK FINANCING
1.    Health: Vaccinations (Programa Ampliado de Imunizacion, or PM,
US$37.5 million or 6 percent of total cost). Towards the end of the 1970s the
Ministry of Health began to implement an immunization program, which currently
vaccinates: (a) infants and children against polio, measles, rubeola, mumps and
neonatal tetanus; (b) at-risk groups against diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough;
and (c) health workers against Hepatitis B. The program, which covers the whole
country, is implemented by the Immunization Departments of the provincial Ministries
of Health, using about 6,000 immunization centers nationwide. The program is
effectively self-targeted, as the majority of those utilizing public health centers are low-
income. In 1994, the immunization program had a 90 to 95 percent coverage of its
target groups.
2.    The physical targets of the program for 1995 and 1996 are: (a) more than 90
percent of children below one year old would receive all required vaccinations for this
age group; (b) more than 90 percent of women of reproductive age in selected
provinces would receive immunization against tetanus; and (c) more than 90 percent of
health workers would be vaccinated against Hepatitis B. These objectives translate to
targeted beneficiaries of about: 630,000 children below 1 year old, 340,000 health
workers, and 140,000 women of reproductive age. For 1996, the estimated number of
beneficiaries is similar to that of 1995. In addition, children of mothers detected to be
positive with Hepatitis B would also be required to receive the appropriate vaccination.
3.    The immunization program is coordinated and supervised by the Epidemiology
Department of the MOH central office. This Department also provides the norms and
guidelines to the Immunization Departments of the provincial Ministries of Health.
The Epidemiology Department carries out a monthly technical supervision of the
program based on the monthly report sent by the provinces on coverage and dosage of
different types of vaccines provided. Field supervision visits are also carried out at
least once a year by the professionals of the Epidemiology Department. Program
improvements for which financing would be sought in 1996 include the acute need for
updating the refrigeration units in the vaccination centers and training of health workers
in the program.
4.    The MOH Epidemiology Department receives monthly progress reports on the
program from the provinces which are consolidated periodically to provide a feedback
for the norms and decisions of the MOH. The MOH would send to the Bank a semi-
annual progress report on the immunization program including, inter alia, a review of
actual coverage vis-a-vis targets, detailed status of program expenditures by different



60                               Annex 2
category of expenditures, status of procurement for items to be financed under the
Bank Loan, and an updated execution plan for the following six months.
5.    Health: Chagas Control Program (Programa de Control de Enfermedades -
Chagas, US$45.5 million or 7 percent of total cost). The Chagas control program
originated in the 1950s, when the first epidemiological survey and laboratory dedicated
to the study of this disease were established. In the early 1980s, the program expanded
with the passage of the Chagas Law (Ley No. 22360) and receipt of institutional
development assistance from the World Health Organization (WHO). The program's
current objective is to eliminate over the next five years the occurrence of new cases of
the disease. This would be done by: (a) controlling the vectoral transmission of the
Tripanosoma Cruzi parasite using insecticide treatment of infected houses and
surrounding structures; (b) screening of pregnant mothers and monitoring children
whose mothers are infected; (c) quality control of blood donated to the 857 laboratories
that belong to the network of the Instituto Nacional de Chagas; (d) detecting and
treating infected children; (e) assisting the rural population in improving their housing
(up to a cost of US$2,500 per house) in order to eradicate the insect vector for the
disease; (f) carrying out entomological surveillance of inspected and treated houses
with community involvement; and (g) developing biomedical and operational research
necessary for the program.
6.    The Ministry of Health, which manages the Chagas program, targets the low-
income rural population (more than 80 percent are families with Unsatisfied Basic
Needs -- NBI) and those with difficult access to medical care. For 1995, MOH's goal
is to disinfect about 217,000 houses (1.6 million persons) and to carry out
entomological surveillance of about 800,000 houses (3.4 million persons). In addition,
the quality control of blood supply and the control of mother-to-child transmission are
estimated to benefit a total of 14 million persons.
7.    The program is implemented by the National Chagas Service (Servicio Nacional
de Chagas, or SNCH) under the Department of Sanitary Medicine of the MOH. Norm
and policy formulation of the program is carried out by the Director of the Department
of Epidemiology, the chief of the SNCH and the Director of the Instituto Nacional de
Chagas. Field implementation and supervision are carried out with about 500 sanitary
agents at the provincial level. Field supervision is also carried out at least once a year
by professionals from the MOH central office.
8.    The provincial MOH offices send monthly reports to the central office on the
progress of program implementation, including the number of houses infected, treated,
and inspected. On this basis, program targets are revised as necessary. The MOH
central office consolidates these reports and prepares annual progress reports. Under
the Project, the MOH Department of Epidemiology would send the Bank semi-annual
progress reports on the program including, inter alia, a review of actual coverage vis-
a-vis targets, detailed status of program expenditures by different category of
expenditures, status of procurement for items to be financed under the Bank Loan, and



61                              Annex 2
updated execution plan for the following six months. The primary monitoring
indicators of program status are shown in Annex 2.
9.    Nutrition (Apoyo Solidario a los Mayores, or ASOMA, US$86 million or 14
percent of total cost). The Secretaria de Desarrollo Social started ASOMA in 1993, as
a way of offering nutritional and health assistance to the elderly poor. The program is
designed to benefit people 60 years of age or more who do not receive a pension and
are at high risk of illness on account of their poor nutritional condition. Of the 4.6
million Argentines over 60 years of age, 350,000 are in need of social assistance, based
on the poverty index (NBI). Of these, 144,000 are now beneficiaries of ASOMA.
10.   Targeting is achieved through a poverty map which uses the poverty index (a
more sensitive index for this program is currently being tested). In addition,
information is provided by each potential participant through an extensive
questionnaire. This indicates, health condition, physical mobility, access to income and
other social services, and family circumstances. Details of the ASOMA beneficiary
population are currently being computerized. In situations where there are more
eligible candidates for the program than resources, the final selection of beneficiaries is
made by the community.
11.   For most beneficiaries, the food -- valued at US$25 a month -- is packed in a
17-kilo box of commodities designed to provide 1500 calories and 40 grams of protein
a day. A small fraction of participants receive daily meals in a dining facility.
Nutrition considerations are reflected in the selection of the foods.
12.   ASOMA's budget resources, currently amounting to about US$43 million for
1995, are transferred to the provinces. In most cases, the provincial governments
organize competitive bidding for the purchase of the food. About 15 percent of the
program is handled directly by non-government organizations, primarily church-related
groups. An effort is under way to expand NGO involvement in ASOMA.
13.   The ASOMA staff in the Secretariat of Social Development headquarters
consists of about 50 persons including 21 professionals. Half deal with planning, while
the other half review proposals, organize contracts, and manage project execution. The
Subsecretariat for the Elderly audits the receipts for purchases of food.
14.   An agreement signed in May 1995 between ASOMA and the Instituto Nacional
de Servicios Sociales Para Jubilados y Pensionados (INSSJP), which runs the
Programa de Atencion Medica Integral (PAMI), should strengthen ASOMA. PAMI
has successfully provided food to over 300,000 elderly persons receiving the minimum
pension of 150 pesos per month. It would provide training and technical assistance to
ASOMA and in some cases share its dining facilities. The collaboration would also
help to eliminate any overlap between the two programs.



62                               Annex 2
15.   The team managing ASOMA is committed to undertaking a series of measures
to improve the program's effectiveness. They include: (a) establishing procedures to
assure continuity of food delivery, e.g., a guarantee of funding levels for food
purchases and quicker reimbursement to the provinces through streamlining of
reporting requirements; (b) adding to the ASOMA coordinating units representatives of
major NGOs and community organizations, to assist in the selection of the neediest
beneficiaries; (c) improving financial control systems; (d) strengthening management
information systems, in order to avoid duplication of benefits, including recipients of
food supplements under the PAMI program; (e) strengthening nutrition education
activities to change beneficiaries' behavior; (f) incorporating as an investment objective
to the program community service activities for children rendered by beneficiaries in
exchange for the food package (e.g., the elderly would teach a child to read, help
prepare a school meal, clear fields for preparing playgrounds, etc.); (g) organizing
training sessions at each level of program implementation about how to improve
targeting, reporting, purchasing, and mobilizing communities; and (h) developing a
program of studies to measure the impact of ASOMA, assess the perception of the
beneficiaries on the food ingredients and better target the program. Implementation of
these institutional strengthening measures is estimated to cost US$1.8 million
16.   Rural Poverty (Programa Social Agropecuario, or PSA, US$10.0 million, or
2 percent of total cost). The PSA pilot program was created in 1993 by the Secretariat
of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries (SAGyP). The objective is to help improve the
income of the economically active rural poor through the provision of financial and
technical assistance. The original objective was to reach 30,000 producers nation-wide
over three years. The program assists with the organization of producer groups (of
about 6 to 20 households), which provides economies of scale and better bargaining
power vis-a-vis marketing intermediaries. Technical assistance from national and local
government institutions, NGOs, and the private sector provides access to better
technology. Subprojects are financed in the form of both grants and credit, with the
terms dependent on the type of investment.
17.   The program benefits poor smallholders; i.e., those whose deficiencies in
organization, infrastructure and technology and geographic isolation result in low
productivity and vulnerability to better organized brokers. It also benefits the new poor
i.e., those who have been affected by the privatization or restructuring of public and
private companies such as sugar and tobacco enterprises, or the closing of mines, and
are now returning to small-scale farming. Because of their small scale, limited
possibilities for providing physical guarantees, and general lack of integration into the
formal economy, these producers have no access to credit from commercial banks and
do not have the means to contract technical assistance.
18.   The program's beneficiaries must meet the following eligibility criteria: (a) the
producers work and live on their farm; (b) the producer has no permanent hired labor;
(c) non-agricultural income is lower than the wage of a rural worker; (d) the income
from agricultural activities is less than double the income of a permanent rural laborer;



63                                    Annex 2
and (e) the amount of capital owned is less than US$20,000. Special efforts are made
to ensure participation of indigenous populations through focused technical assistance
and representation in decision-making bodies. The program is also working
increasingly with underemployed rural laborers in small rural towns. Program funds are
allocated to provincial coordinating units consistent with that province's proportion of
small-holders as measured by the 1988 Agricultural Census, with over 70 percent of
funds assigned to the Northeastern and Northwestern Regions.
19.    PSA funds are used for: (a) training and technical assistance to staff, extension
services, and small producers (about 10 percent of budget); (b) production subprojects
(about 85 percent of budget); and (c) operating costs (about 5 percent of budget).
Subprojects include home-consumption (autoconsumo)l for groups whose physical
isolation or lack of organizational experience render commercial activities infusible,
and associative productive enterprises (EPAs)2 for groups with better opportunities.
From September 1993 to February 1995, PSA spent a total of US$15.3 million on
almost 400 autoconsumo projects benefiting 4,200 families and about 750 EPAs
benefiting over 9,000 families, at an average program cost of approximately US$227
per direct beneficiary.
For autoconsumo subprojects, a grant of up to $100 per family and $2000 per group is provided to
cover working capital (used for seeds or animals) and some fixed capital (primarily tools), contingent
on contribution of labor by beneficiaries. The grant has to be "repaid" in kind, without interest, to a
non-profit institution (e.g) school or hospitals) chosen by the beneficiaries. Autoconsumo projects
consist primarily of vegetable gardens and poultry production.
2 EPA subprojects cover working capital and fixed assets (maximum of $50,000 per project, and not
exceeding $1200 per family). Traditional activities receive two to six year loans with a grace period
of at least one year and then are charged an interest rate of 6 percent per year on the outstanding
balance. An additional non-refundable amount of up to 20 percent of the financing can be used to
contract technical assistance. Labor has to be provided by the beneficiaries. Innovative activities
have to be associated with research institutions (i.e., universities of INTA) and are provided with
softer financing terms including longer time frames for repayment and interest rate of only 4 percent.
EPA subprojects cover: (a) improvement or expansion of vegetable or fruit production; (b)
introduction of new crops to diversify production; (c) improvement in small-scale cattle production;
(d) small agro-industry; (e) rural handicraft production; (f) marketing improvements; and (g)
improvement of production-related infrastructure.

TECHNICAL DISSEMINATION PLAN (SEEMPRO)
(PLANDE TRANSFERENCI4 YASISTENCI4 TECNICA)
I. Objectives
1.    During the first two years of its implementation, SIEMPRO would develop a
program of gradual transference, technical assistance, and training based on the
information, methodologies and systems developed for targeting, monitoring and
evaluation of social programs especially directed to the poor. For this purpose, an amount
of about US$2.0 million would be allocated for a Technical Dissemination Plan (TDP)
under the proposed project with the following specific objectives:
(a) assist in the establishment of small provincial SLEMPRO units (Unidades
Ejecutoras Provinciales, UEP) in the provincial Ministry of Social Action or other
counterpart provincial agency which would set up the social information system and
monitoring/evaluation of provincial social programs targeted to the poor; and
(b) finance the monitoring and evaluation and/or other technical studies for
targeted social programs with priority for those supported under Component A of the
Social Protection Project.
H. Operational Mechanism
2.    The TDP would operate on a demand-driven basis with respect to resource
transfer to the provinces (i.e. objective (a) above). A provincial Ministry of Social Action
or equivalent SDS provincial counterpart agency interested in receiving financial
assistance for the above objectives would need to send a letter of request (carta de
adhesion) to SDS-SIEMPRO. The primary eligibility criterion to qualify a province for
TDP funding would be its poverty situation as characterized by its NBI level. Provinces
with more than 25% NBI would receive priority in TDP funding. In case the requesting
province qualify under this basic criterion, SIEMPRO would carry out a diagnostic
evaluation of the requesting provincial agency, taking into account the following factors:
(i) deficiency in availability of information for poverty monitoring; (ii) absence of clear
targeting criteria in the social programs of the province; (iii) absence of systematic
monitoring and evaluation of social programs; and (iv) internal institutional setting and
inter-institutional linkages of the requesting provincial agency. Once SIEMPRO approves
its inclusion, the provincial agency would need to execute a subsidiary agreement
(Convenio de Adhesion) with SIEMPRO, which would set out the conditions for the
resource transfer and the supervisory arrangements between SIEMPRO and the
counterpart institution. This agreement would be accompanied by a Work Plan (Plan de



82                              Annex 7
Trabajo) which would define the respective institutional responsibilities and expected
outputs with their corresponding schedules.
3.    After a subsidiary agreement has been executed between SIEMPRO and the
participating province, SEMPRO would contract the UEP coordinator and purchase the
information system hardware and software for the UEP. Each participating province
would receive funding of no more than US$200, 000 under the TDP in the form of
consultant services, computer hardware/software and basic training.
4.   In the case of national social agencies responsible for the programs under
Component A of this project (i.e.. objective (b) above! some specific technical assistance,
as necessary, would be supported through the TDP. Each proposal would need to be
reviewed and approved by the Bank. A subsidiary agreement would be executed between
SIEMPRO and the proponent agency to define the responsibilities for resource transfers
from SIEMPRO and expected outputs from the agency concerned.
