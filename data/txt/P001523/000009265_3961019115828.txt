MADAGASCAR
ENERGY I PROJECT
(Credit 1787-MAG)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Energy I Project in
Madagascar, for which Credit 1787-MAG in the amount of SDR 19.8 million (US$25.0
million equivalent) was approved on April 28, 1987.
The Credit was closed on December 31, 1994, two years after the original closing
date. Final disbursement took place on May 17, 1995 and a balance of US$1.6 was
canceled. Cofinancing for the project was provided by EIB, BADEA and US AID. Since
the Energy I Project financed only a part of the power sector investment program, the
remainder of this program was financed by CFD, the EDF and the Swiss Government.
The ICR was prepared by Nourredine Bouzaher of the Industry and Energy
Operations Division of the Central Africa and Indian Ocean Department of the Africa
Region (AF3IE), with inputs from Stephen Gaull, Shinichi Mori (Consultants) and
secretarial assistance from Liliane Yomekpe (Language Staff Assistant). It was reviewed
by lain T. Christie, Division Chief (AF3IE) and by P. Hari Prasad Operations Advisor
(AF3DR). The borrower and one cofinancier provided comments that are included as
appendices to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion
mission, June 13-July 1, 1994. It is based on material in the project file. The borrower
contributed to preparation of the ICR by preparing its own evaluation of the project's
execution.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
ENERGY I PROJECT
(Credit 1787-MAG)
MADAGASCAR
Introduction
1.    The Bank Group has provided funds for three energy sector operations and two forestry
projects wvhich have subsequentlv created important supplv options. The first energy project
financed the Andekaleka Hydropower Project with a credit of US$43 million (Credit 817-MAG,
May 1978). This credit was closed on September 15, 1986. The project included the construction
of a dam and power plant with two 29 MW  generating units, engineering services, technical
assistance, and training. The project achieved its objective of exploiting an important hydropower
resource to economically displace thermal power in the Antananarivo interconnected supply
network. In the process, the staff of JIRAMA increased their knowledge of major project design
and implementation. Lessons learned from the project include the need for improved demand
forecasting techniques and market analysis to reduce the risk of premature investment. Least-cost
planning, tariffs and management were also identified as areas where a capacity building effort was
necessaryv.
2.     Under the second energy sector project, the Petroleum Exploration Promotion Credit of
1980 (Credit 1016-MAG), the Government of Madagascar established the legal and fiscal
framework for exploration and promotion and assembled the required data. Four contracts were
signed with major oil companies and more than US$90 million were spent on drilling activities.
The third energy sector project, the Tsimorora Heavy Oil Exploration Project of 1982 (Credit
1298-MAG) delineated with more precision the Tsimorora reservoir, thereby justifying further
seismic analyses in 1985, and shallow drilling in 1986. However, recoverable reserves were too
low for commercial development. In the forestry sector, two operations contnrbuted to energy
sector development by generating large quantities of charcoal feedstock in the form of thinnings
and smallwood. These are the first and second Mangoro Forestry Projects (Loan 1065-MAG and
Credit 525-MAG, 1974-1981 and Credit 1661-MAG, 1982) which helped the Government
complete the establishment of about 80,000 hectares of pine plantations in the Haut Mangoro.
3.     Under the Joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment Program and at the request of the
Government of Madagascar, the Bank conducted an energy sector assessment. The report (No.
5700-MAG), which was published in 1987 after a detailed review by the Government, concluded
that the sector issues which required the most urgent attention were: (a) the rehabilitation of
gcneration, transmission and distribution facilities; (b) the gross  under-utilization of the
hvdropower potential available at the Andekaleka hydropower plant; (c) the general weakness of
energy policy, planning and investment programming; and (d) the increasing shortage of woodfuels
for household cooking and the ensuing deforestation and environmental degradation. The Energy I
Project was designed to address these issues.
Project Objectives
4.     The major project objectives were to: (a) help the Government strengthen energy policy
formulation, investment programming, and institutional development; (b) assist JIRAMA, in



ii Madagascar Energy 1. Implementation Completion Report
improving the efficiency of resource utilization in the power subsector by strengthening financial
management, planning and manpower development, and by rehabilitating deteriorated subsector
infrastructure; and (c) expand the supply of electric power and household energy products at least-
cost and through rational pricing.
5.     The components of the project, which are consistent with the above objectives, can be
broken down into a power subsector component and a household energy component. The latter
also included the institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Energy and Mines. The project's
objectives were clear and realistic in view of the implementation capacity of the borrower and the
implementing agency. Nonetheless, if one considers in retrospect, the number of contracts, the
geographical dispersion of the works and the number of cofinanciers involved, the project was
complex. However, after a teething period, both the Ministry of Energy and Mines and JIRAMA
have shown growing mastery and ownership of the process.
Implementation Experience and Results
6.     The project has substantially achieved its major objectives. Sector policies have been
substantially improved and there is greater reliance on price signals to allocate resources. Least-
cost planning and tariffs based on long-run marginal cost were introduced. Because the supply
costs differ significantly between the regions, three tariff zones were distinguished, therefore
eliminating the national uniform tariff that was previously in place. To maintain tariffs in real
terms, the government also introduced an indexation formula. However, payment arrears to
JIRAMA by government and other public bodies (universities and municipalities) have been and
remain a chronic problem. The project created and strengthened local capabilities to conceive,
design and carry out policies and project related work in a manner that raised the ability of the
borrower and the implementing agency to make the best use of the financial and human resources
2
put at their disposal. Judged by the number of units sold, the promotion of improved stoves in the
Antananarivo area has been a success. If sustained, it will have a non-negligible impact on poverty
and on the environment. The reliability of electric power supply has also improved mainly through
the rehabilitation of existing installations, and more consumers have been connected to the grid..
However, neither the energy audits nor the electric boiler component which was finally dropped
from the project had much success as beneficiaries expressed no interest in either. Notwithstanding
the commitments of the government and the executing agency to a lasting impact, the sustainability
of these achievements will be strongly affected by and dependent upon a follow-up project now
under preparation that would continue and expand the activities initiated in the project under
review. This forthcoming operation introduces several reforms in the sector, including private
sector participation, which are likely to strengthen sustainability.
7.     At appraisal the total cost of the project was estimated at US$59.8 million, of which
US$44.8 million was in foreign exchange. The actual project cost was US$54.7 million. The
financial arrangements and the coordination between the cofinanciers, the borrower and the
implementing agency were adequate. The original closing date of December 31, 1992, was
IDA. EIB, BADEA and US AID were involved in the financing of Energy L. CFD, the Swiss
Government and the European Development Fund (EDF) financed the remainder of JIRAMA's
reference investment program.

These stoves use an estimated 30% less woodfuel and charcoal than stoves currently found in many
households.

postponed to December 31. 1994. The 1991 civil unrest that marked the transition to a pluralist
democracv in Madagascar was the main factor in this implementation delav.
8.     However, the factors that were subject to government control which had an impact on this
project includc: (a) the time takcn to fulfill the conditions of effectiveness (about six months
between signature and effectivcncss: (b) the accumulation of payment arrears to JIRAMA; and (c)
the lag in the provision of counterpart funds for the components implemented bv the Ministrv of
Energy and Mines, although a substantial amount of these funds was mct by US AID.
9      Bank performance at all stages of the project cycle was satisfactory.  Comprehensive
sector work provided the foundation for the Energy I Project and gave it a strong focus. The
project was propcrlv appraised and intensely supervised. The borrower and the implementing
agency s performance were generallv satisfactory. Credit covenants were complied with except for
the regular payment of government's clectricity bills and the timelv provision of adequate
counterpart funds, as mentioned earlier.
10.    The overall outcome of the project is satisfactory. The project was timely. Without the
rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, the country's power system would have been crippled. The
reliability of supply has improved but the situation remains fragile and needs strengthening in
several arcas: the need to pursue the rehabilitation of existing assets not included in Energy I, the
extension of the distribution network to serve more people, and the reduction of system losses. The
houschold fuels component has madc a promising start in the Antananarivo area, especially with
the involvement of women's organizations. There is strong need to extend this effort to other parts
of the countrv where deforestation and environmental degradation are particularly critical (e.g.
Mahajanga).
Summary of Findin2s. Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
H1.    Scctor work was important in providing a strategic context and focus for the project. This
was instrumental in attracting funding from a number of external donors. Capacity building and
commitment to the operation were important in achieving project objectives. However, Government
commitment was at times ambiguous: on the one hand, it took courageous decisions regarding the
incrcase and indexation of tariffs, on the other, it failed to pav its bills on a regular basis. The
rehabilitatcd assets are a normal part of JlRAMA's asset basc and operations. A follow-up project
nowN undcr preparation will introduce. (a) performancc indicators to ensure that JIRAMA's
installations arc operated in an efficient manner. and (b) an institutional reform of the power sector,
including a new legal framework designed to encourage private sector participation which will
likely improve sustainabilitv.
12.    The kev lessons lcamed from the implementation of this project include: (a) the need to
have a clcar scctor strategy that idcntifics the most urgcnt needs of the sector; (b) a clear
understanding of the objectives of a projcct and commitmcnt to these objcctives bv the borrower
and the implemcnting agency, and (c) the importance of capacity building as an objective.

MADAGASCAR
ENERGY I PROJECT
(Credit 1787-MAG)
PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.    STATEMENT AND EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
Project Objectives
1.1   The major objectives of the project as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)
were to: (a) help the government strengthen energy policy formulation, planning and
investment programming, and institutional development; (b) assist JIRAMA, the power
utility, in improving the efficiency of resource utilization in the power subsector by
strengthening financial management, planning and manpower development, and by
rehabilitating existing deteriorated subsector infrastructure; and (c) expand the supply of
electric power and household energy products at least-cost and through rational pricing.
Evaluation of Objectives
1.2   The project's objectives were clear in the sense that they did not lead to difference
in interpretation between the borrower, the implementing agency and the Bank. They
were also realistic in view of the size of the problems the sector was facing at that time
and the implementation capacity of the borrower and the implementing agency.
Nonetheless, if one considers the range of policy and institutional improvements needed,
the number of contracts (268), the geographical dispersion of the works and the number of
cofinanciers involved, the project was complex. However, both the line Ministry and
JfRAMA have been responsive to change and, after a teething period, have shown
growing mastery and ownership of the process. Mobilization of domestic resources, least-
cost investment choice and international competitive bidding, rational pricing of energy
resources, project management and the fight against environmental degradation caused by
the extensive use of woodfuel were brought to the forefront of sector and country
dialogue.
B.    ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
1.3   The project has substantially achieved its major objectives.
1.4   Sector Policies have been substantially improved. The supply and demand for
various energy sources as well as issues in the relevant subsectors, particularly electricity
and renewable energy, are now better known and this knowledge has facilitated the design
of appropriate policies. The fundamental role of pricing and taxation in eliciting a supply
and demand response is now more widely shared than in the past. Least-cost planning is
routinely used in-house for determining the most appropriate investment program for the



2 Madagascar Energy I: Implementation Completion Report
utility and the tariff policy to be followed to meet the often conflicting objectives of
efficiency, financial viability of the utility, social considerations and ease of administration.
1.5   Financial Obiectivps have been substantially met. A tariff system based on long-
run marginal costs (LRMC) was introduced. In order to take account of the significant
difference in economic costs between the separate systems in its service area, JIRAMA
introduced three tariff zones according to the predominant fuel source used for power
generation in that zone (hydro, heavy fuel oil and gasoil) and the uniform national tariff
was eliminated. Initially, the predominantly hydro zone (the Antananarivo interconnected
system) subsidized the two other zones, but after successive tariff adjustments, the subsidy
was progressively eliminated and tariffs were brought up to levels dictated by supply costs.
During 1989-1992, JIRAMA raised tariffs by up to 30% annually and the average tariff
reached the level of LRMC for the utility as a whole (equivalent to US cents 12.4/kWh).
However, while these tariff adjustments were sufficient to meet the efficiency objective
they were not adequate to ensure the financial viability of the utility which has been
deprived of justified tariff increases in the past. At the end of 1992, the government
decided to allow JERAMA four successive increases of the average tariff level of 5% each,
to be applied at one-semester intervals. Furthermore, in order to maintain the real level of
tariffs, the government introduced the principle of automatic tariff adjustment, by means of
an indexation formula, linking tariffs to the exchange rate, fuel prices and the consumer
price index.  The ease of administration and billing was also considerably improved
through the streamlining of tariff categories to a manageable number (from well in excess
of 400 to about 30), and computerization. A process of billing decentralization to the
regions is also under way.
1.6     Government, universities' and municipalities' payment arrears to JIRAMA have
been and still are a major problem. Cross-debt settlements between the government and
JIRAMA were effected twice during implementation of the project. Although these
exercises were meant to provide a new starting point for the regular payment of
government bills, arrears accumulated anew. The problem is compounded by the fact that
the government does not accept responsibility for the arrears accumulated by universities
and municipalities, which it says are autonomous bodies that should pay their bills and not
rely on the government budget. The solutions agreed with the government include the
interdiction for government departments of transferring funds meant for utilities (water,
telecommunications and electricity) to other categories in the budget and a simplified
procedure for the payment of JIRAMA's bills. However, under-funding is also to blame,
in spite of joint discussions on forecast consumption before the budget is submitted to the
National Assembly.  On the other hand, JIRAMA  does not pay its debts to the
government. As for universities and municipalities, they often are financially strapped and
the only recourse for JIRAMA is to withhold supply of electricity. This, however, may
not always be feasible.
1.7   Institutional Development. The project created and strengthened local capabilities
to conceive, design and carry out policy and project work in a manner that raised the
technical ability of the borrower and the implementing agency to make the best use of



Part 1 Project Implementation Assessment 3
financial and human resources at their disposal either internally or through external
assistance. In the Ministry of Energy, a capacity to undertake policy formulation
(including in energy pricing and taxation), design energy efficiency programs and methods
for promoting the efficient production and consumption of woodfuels and charcoal has
been created.  JIRAMA's capacity to elaborate least-cost expansion plans and tariff
studies has already been referred to. However, given the project's complexity (seven
cofinanciers, numerous often small contracts and geographically dispersed works), project
management has perhaps been one of the most important of JIRAMA's achievements.
1.8   Physical Objectives.
a) Components Implemented by JIRAMA. When this project was appraised in
June 1986, the situation in the power sector was critical. The infrastructure was old and
deteriorating and there was a backlog in maintenance mainly due to lack of foreign
exchange to purchase spare parts.  This led to growing generation and distribution
difficulties and to frequent power cuts which paralyzed many economic activities. The aid
flow was modest and JIRAMA had to resort to short-term suppliers' credits to finance a
small part of its requirements (e.g. diesel power plant expansion) which often, in
retrospect, were a low priority use of foreign exchange. The foreign exchange limitation
was further exacerbated by natural disasters (floods and cyclones). Finally, weaknesses in
planning and overt government intervention in investment decision-making had led to an
imbalance in investment between generation expansion, which the government favored,
and rehabilitation of existing facilities, which continued to deteriorate.
1.9    With the implementation of the Energy I Project, the reliability of supply has been
significantly increased, although the lack of distribution equipment has become a
bottleneck to the extension of supply services. Between 1988 and 1994, gross generation
increased from 429 GWh to an estimated 557 GWh, representing a 30% increase over the
period. The share of hydro-electric generation in this increase is 77%. Installed capacity
remained about the same (from 212.8 MW to 215.4 MW) but comprises in excess of 30%
of rehabilitated generating units. Sales increased from 368 GWh to 449.5 GWh and the
number of consumers increased from 150,123 in 1988 to 184,940 in 1994 (an increase of
34,817 consumers over the period). Due to the country's poor economic performance in
recent years, the yearly average consumption per consumer stagnated at about 2430 kWh.
With a view to extending the supply of electricity to rural and peri-urban areas, a pilot
distribution project was tested using simple design and materials that could save up to
30% in construction costs. Its full scale implementation is left to a forthcoming IDA
operation (the Energy Sector Development Project).
1.10  Against these achievements, however, the level of electricity losses has increased
from 15.5% to 18%, with the largest increase in the Antananarivo area. This is due to the
large increase in demand in a poorly structured network that is no longer able to carry the
necessary flow. Past mistakes in the choice of the size of generating units are still felt
today as these units are poorly suited to the general pattern of demand. Although
considerable progress has been achieved in the maintenance of power installations,



4 Madagascar Energy 1 Implementation Completion Report
particularly hydro, less attention has been paid to the maintenance of thermal generating
sets which are mostly found in rural areas. As a result, new or rehabilitated generating
sets are deteriorating faster than desirable.
1.11   Components Implemented by the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MiEM  .  The
technical assistance provided to the Ministry of Energy to prepare and evaluate energy
sector policies, plans and investment programs was satisfactorily implemented. The results
have been the formulation of a national energy plan and the production, on a periodic
basis, of a national energy balance and other energy data.  As a part of a global
investigation on rural electrification in Madagascar, a study was also undertaken in the
main rice producing region of the country, the Lake Alaotra region, to assess its energy
needs and ways in which these could be met. One possibility that has been identified, on
the supply side, is the construction of a small woodfuel-fired power plant to supply the
electricity demand of the region. This plant would use the thinnings and small wood
provided by a nearby large government owned plantation as fuel. The idea is still being
investigated.
1.12  The household energy component comprised the design and dissemination of
improved stoves in the Antananarivo-Antsirabe area, an investigation into the sustainability
of the woodfuel source, training of small artisans in the production of improved stoves,
training of charcoalers in modern charcoaling techniques, and assistance to the state
owned plantation FANALAMANGA in market studies for pine charcoal for domestic and
industrial use (pine charcoal competes with eucalyptus charcoal). The total consumption
of woodfuel in the Antananarivo region is about 112,000 tons per year. This demand is
principally met from private plantations and not from the natural forest as originally
thought. This, however, may not be true for other parts of the country (e.g. Mahajanga).
The promotion of improved stoves, with a saving of up to 33% in charcoal consumption,
has been a success, especially with the involvement of women's organizations. Also, as
woodfuel and charcoal are mainly used by low income people, improved stoves had an
anti-poverty benefit in diminishing the relative share of energy expenditures in household
budgets. About 100 artisans have been trained in the production of improved stoves and
these are readily available in local markets at an affordable price (about I US dollar a
piece).
1. 13  Twenty four preliminary and ten detailed energy audits were carried out in various
industries. In general, the response was not good as industrialists were more interested in
replacing their old production equipment with new energy saving units. This, they argued,
would allow them to increase the quantity and the quality of their production and at the
same time reap the benefits of energy savings. The most interesting response was found in
modern export industries (textiles in particular). However, to date no action to implement
the recommendations of the energy audits has been taken by the beneficiaries.
At thc timc of appraisal. the Ministnr of Energy and Mines was known as the Ministrv of Industrv.
Energy and Mincs (MIEM).



Part I Project Implementation Assessment 5
C.  MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
1.14  The factor outside of government control that most affected the project was the
1991 civil disturbances which accelerated the pace of transition to a more open society in
Madagascar but which inevitably disrupted economic activity. During much of that year,
the project came to standstill  In this category, one should also include the electric boiler
component, whose aim was to encourage large-scale industrial use of surplus hydro-
electricity in the Antananarivo region, which was dropped from the project for lack of
interest by the four enterprises (three industries and one hotel) concemed. However, the
factors that were subject to government control which had an impact on this project
include: (a) the time taken to fulfill the conditions for effectiveness (about 6 months
between signature and effectiveness); (b) the accumulation of payment arrears to
J1RAMA; and (c) the lag in the provision of counterpart funds for the components
implemented by the Ministry of Energy and Mines, although a substantial amount of these
counterpart funds was met by US AID. On the side of the implementing agency, given the
complexity of the project there has been a process of leaming which caused delay in
project implementation. As of March 31, 1992, disbursements and commitments for the
components implemented by JIRAMA, accounted for 38% and 73% respectively. This
made it unlikely that the project would be fully implemented by the December 31, 1992
original closing date. At JIRAMA's request, the Bank agreed to postpone the closing date
to December 31, 1994.
1.15  Although there has been a two-year implementation delay due principally to the
1991 civil disturbances, the project was satisfactorily completed with a saving of US$1.6
million on the IDA Credit.
D.    PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
1.16  The Energy I Project only financed a time-slice of the power sector investment
program. The sustainability of its achievements, which has to be seen in a program
framework, will be strongly affected by and dependent upon a follow-up project now
under preparation that continues and expands the activities in the project under review.
This forthcoming operation, for which several cofinanciers have expressed an interest, is
essential to confirm the gains achieved under the Energy I Project. It introduces several
reforms in the sector, including private sector participation, which are likely to strengthen
sustainability. At the same time, the macroeconomic environment and the business climate
should improve sufficiently to encourage private sector participation. The commitment of
the implementing agency to the project is strong. Govemment commitment, however,
does not come out as clearly, sometimes strong (e.g. tariff increases) and sometimes
fading (e.g. lack of settlement of govemment arrears to JIRAMA). The institutional and
management capacity that was built under the project in both the Ministry of Energy and
JIRAMA is likely to be sustained.



6 Madagascar Energy I: Implementation Completion Report
E.  BANK PERFORMANCE
1.17        The Bank performance at all stages of the project cycle was satisfactory.
The issues facing the energy sector were correctly identified in the Madagascar: Issues and
Options in the Energy Sector (UNDP/World Bank, January 1987). The issues and
recommendations of this report, which had been known since June 1985, were adequately
taken into account in the preparation and appraisal of the Energy I Project in June 1986,
especially with regard to the power and renewable energy subsectors. In retrospect, two
elements could have been ascertained: (a) the interest of beneficiaries in the electric boiler
component. This was harmless, however, because it was later dropped from the project;
and (b) the lack of interest of industries in energy audits. This could have saved some
financial resources. Furthermore, more money should have been allocated to the
distribution component because it was later shown to be a bottleneck to the extension of
electricity services. The project served to channel external funding to the sector and the
Bank kept a close dialogue with the multilateral and bilateral agencies involved and, under
JIRAMA's leadership, all activities were quite effectively coordinated. The project was
intensely supervised and there was a close working relationship between the Ministry of
Energy, JIRAMA and the Bank. Implementation progress was adequately reported by
supervision missions and also through quarterly reports of the Ministry of Energy and
JIRAMA, for their respective components. Implementation problems were identified and
assessed and the Bank provided advice for resolving them whenever necessary. During
the implementation of this project, Bank policies and procedures were adhered to.
F.  BORROWER PERFORMANCE
1.18  The borrower and the implementing agency participated actively in the preparation
of this project and their performance can be judged satisfactory.  Implementation
performance was generally satisfactory. Credit covenants were complied with except for:
(a) the govemment arrears to JIRAMA. Although the Bank initiated two cross-debt
settlements between the govermment and JIRAMA, this problem was not permanently
resolved and still lingers; and (b) the timely provision of adequate counterpart funds for
the components implemented by the Ministry of Energy. Institutionally, both the Ministry
of Energy and JIRAMA organized themselves to deal with the implementation of this
complex project. Both institutions acquired a mastery of Bank procedures, especially in
procurement.  JIRAMA has competent technical staff and installations are generally
properly taken care of, except that more emphasis should be put on the maintenance of
thermal generating units, especially diesel sets.  Although to some extent outside
JIRAMA's control because it depends more on the quality of the network, there is wide
scope for the reduction in the level of technical losses, especially in the Antananarivo
network but probably also elsewhere.



Part 1: Project Implementation Assessment 7
G.  ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
1.19  The overall outcome of the project is satisfactory. The life of important assets has
been extended and the use of surplus hydro capacity in the Antananarivo network has
greatly improved. The reliability of supply is good and many new consumers were
connected to the system. In the absence of the project, the sector's assets would have
deteriorated to a point were the country's power supply system would have been crippled.
The project was therefore timely. However, the supply situation remains fragile and needs
strengthening in several areas: the need to pursue the rehabilitation of existing assets not
included in the Energy I Project which only dealt with part of existing assets, the extension
of the distribution network to serve more people, better utilization of hydro capacity in the
Fianarantsoa region and the reduction of system losses, in particular. The revision of the
legal and regulatory framework and alternative forms of private participation, particularly
through independent power generation, are now being investigated by consultants.
1.20  The institutional capacity building effort has been quite effective and owes much to
the commitment and ownership of the project by the Ministry of Energy and JIRAMA.
The promotion of improved stoves has been a success especially through the enlistment of
women's organizations, but the multi-dimensional problem of woodfuel use should have
been tackled in a more general framework that would have included forestry management
and agriculture, poverty, environmental protection, and pricing policies.
H.   FUTURE OPERATION
1.21  The technical, financial and institutional arrangements to ensure effective project
operation have been in place for sometime as part of JIRAMA's normal operations. Any
asset that is rehabilitated or replaced is immediately put back into service and operated so
as to minimize system costs. The agreement that has been reached between the Bank and
the government to allow JIRAMA to implement tariff adjustments in line with changes in
the consumer price index, the exchange rate and the price of fuel, will remain in place. As
stated previously, the distribution network needs to be extended to reach more consumers.
There is strong donor interest in the sector and several cofinanciers have expressed a
willingness to finance this extension.
1.22  During appraisal of the Energy I Project, technical, institutional and financial
performance indicators were agreed between JIRAMA and the Bank. These performance
indicators which were largely adhered to during the implementation of the project will be
maintained and form a part of the Bank dialogue with the implementing agency.
1.    KEY LESSONS LEARNED
1.23  The following lessons were leamed:
(a)   for a project to be successful, it should meet the most urgent needs of the
sector. The foundation is a clear sector strategy;



8 Madagascar Energy 1: Implementation Completion Report
(b)   a clear understanding of the objectives of a project and commitment to
these objectives by the borrower and the implementing agency are
essential. This commitment can be demonstrated in various ways such as
adjusting tariffs, improving the legal and regulatory framework, etc.; and
(c)   to enhance the prospects for sustainability, capacity building, that is raising
the capacity of the borrower and the implementing agency to do things for
and by themselves, should be an important objective of a project.

Table 9: Economic Costs and Benefits
1.     Incremental capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, and benefit streams (all in 1995
prices) refer to JIRAMA's investment program.
2.     Capital expenditures on generation, transmission and distribution investments at financial prices
are converted to economic prices by: (i) expressing the import content at c.i.f priecs; and (ii) applying a
standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.85 to local costs.
3.     Incremental operation and maintenance costs are estimated at 2.5% of cumulative investmcnt costs
and adjusted using a SCF of 0.85.
4.     Fuel costs are based on incremental thermal generation requirements.
5.     Economic benefits associated with incremental electricity supply to consumers are calculated using
consumers' willingness to pay as proxies for benefits.

Estimation of the Willingness to Pay (WTP)
7.     Domestic Electricity Consumption. Although data on elasticity of demand for electricity is not
available at the present time, the average willingness to pay for all classes of consumers is most certainly
higher than the level of the current electricity tariff. For low-income household consumers, who are not
connected to the grid and who cannot afford to install private generating sets, the actual costs of lighting
through use of kerosene lamps and candles are higher than reflected by the current tariff rate. The
estimated cost of using kerosene lamps and candles is currently about 862.5 FMG and 750 FMG/kWh
equivalent respectively. The weighted average cost of a kWh is 772.5 FMG.
Estimated Cost of Lighting in Madagascar using Kerosene Lamps and Candles
a. Kerosene Lamps
1. Cost of Kerosene                                 1120 FMG/liter
2. Equivalent kWh per liter of kerosene             3.4 kWh/liter
3. Ratio of conversion efficiency of kerosene       0.4
4. Equivalent cost of usable energy from
kerosene = (i,2)/3                                823.5 FMG/kWh
5. Capital cost of kerosene lamp                    1500 FMG
6. Capital annuity factor at 10% and 3-yr life      0.402
7. Equivalent capital cost
ovcr 200 kWh/year/lamp: (5*6)/200                 3.02 FMG/kWh
8. Total cost of using kerosene
for lighting (4+7)                                826.5 FMG/kWh
b. Candles
1. Equivalent power per candle                      133.3 watts
2. 1 kWh                                            7.5 candles
3. Cost of a candle                                 100 FMG
4. Equivalent cost of a kWh                         750 FMG/kWh
Based on field investigations, it has been estimated that only about 20% of households use
kerosene lamps for lighting. The remaining 80% use candles. The weighted average willingness to pay for
low-income household consumers is: (750*.8) + (862.5*.2) = 600 + 172.5 = 772.5 FMG/kWh. Minimum
lighting requirements represent about 50% of total domestic electricity use. In the absence of electricity
supply, households would use candles and kerosene lamps. This portion is valued at the economic cost of
FMG 772.5/kWh equivalent. The remainder of consumption is valued at a price declining to the average
tariff for low voltage consumers (FMG 226/kWh). Household budget data are hard to come by and those
available are generally outdated. It has however been estimated that on the basis of a specific consumption
of 10 kWh/month, the yearly electricity bill based on the adjusted WTP of 612.3 FMG/kWh would
represent 5 to 8% of the budget of an urban low income household.
8.     Non-Domestic Electricity Consumption.   Willingness to pay for medium and low (other than
domestic) voltage consumers is assumed to be approximated by the July 1993 respective average tariffs.
9.     Weighted Average WTP. The weighted average willingness to pay for a kWh of incremental
electricity supply is derived as follows using the 1993 consumption mix:

PROJET ENERGIE I
AIDE-NIEMOIRE DE LA MIISSION D'ACHIEVEMENT DU PROJET
1.           La mission d'achevement di- Projet Energie I dirigee par M. Stephen Gaull a
accompli son travail entre le 13 juin et le Ier juillet 1994, parallelement a une autre mission de la
Banque mondiale affectee au Projet de developpement du secteur 6nergetique (PDSE). La mission
tient a remercier les autorites, ses homologues au sein de l'Administration, la JIRAMA, ainsi que
les organismes, beneficiaires et bailleurs de fonds ayant participe au projet, pour leur collaboration
a l'accomplissement de sa tache, qui avait pour but d'amorcer les preparatifs d'un rapport
d'achevement de 1'2x6cution du projet couvert par le Credit 1787-MAG, dont la date de cloture est
tixee au 31 deceinbre 1994. La mission a examine les divers elements du projet avec les
responsables concernes, et a fourni des indications a la JIRAMA et a la Direction de l'Energie
Nationale (DEN) du Ministere de l'Energie et des Mines (MEM) - principaux organismes
d'execution - a propos de leur contribution au rapport d'achevernent et sur la facon de
comptabiliser les couts et le financement du projet. En plus de communiquer, d'ici quelques mois,
leurs propres vues concernant l'execution du projet, la JIRAMA et la DEN fourniront des
informations complementaires a la Banque mondiale. 11 a ete convenu qu'il vaudrait mieux
6laborer un plan de travail dans le cadre du PDSE, qui doit succ6der au Projet Energie I.
2.           Les principales conclusions de la mission peuvent se resumer ainsi:
a) En ce qui concerne le programme d'investissement de la JIRAMA:
. Ie solde du credit devra etre engage en totalite avant le 31 decembre 1994
. avant le 15 juillet 1994, une evaluation des avantages g6n6r6s par le Projet sera transmise
A l'IDA.
b) En ce qui concerne le renforcement institutionnel de la JIRAMA:
. Non-realisation des objectifs visant au retablissement de l'quilibre financier de la
J IRA MA
c) En ce qui concerne le renforcement institutionnel du MEM:
. Un effort soutenu devra etre fourni pour renforcer la capacite institutionnelle de la
Direction de l'Energie en rnatiere de coordination de la planification energetique et de la politique
sectorielle
. Le solde inutifise initialement affecte au MEM devra atre reporte sur l'exercice 1995 du
PIP
U Un credit bud.etaire additionnel est necessaire pour couvrir le deficit que les coats en
mnonnaie locale devraient connaitre d'ici a la fin de l'annee.
Pro-ramme d'investissement de la JIRAMA
Dans 1'ensemble. Ia JIRAMA a realise avec succes les investissements materiels
v isass dans le cadre du projet, ce qui renforce les perspectives de viabilite a l'avenir. La
m;n jeur e partie des travaux concernes portaient, en priorite, sur la remise en dtat des centrales



- 2 -
electriques et du reseau de transport et de distribution de la JIRAMA, qui avaient ete negliges en
raison d'un manque de pieces de rechange, auquel s'ajoutait un entretien inadequat. Au premier
trimestre 1994, la JIRAMA avait deja engage 87 % du montant du credit qui lui a ete attribue, et
compte engager le solde prochainement. Les engagements cofinances s'e1evaient a 94 % et
devraient atteindre 99 % d'ici peu. La mission a exhorte la JIRAMA a faire tout son possible pour
que le solde du credit soit engage et decaisse au complet d'ici a la date de cloture, soit le
31 ddcembre 1994.
4.           On a convenu d'une methode de calcul des taux de rentabilite ex post d'un
programme d'investissement ax6 sur des remises en etat hautement prioritaires. Pour mesurer les
avantages du projet, la JIRAMA determinera, avec le concours dela SOGELERG, un niveau de
degradation theorique voisin de celui qu'auraient atteint les centrales electriques et le reseau de
transport et de distribution si le projet n'avait pas e  entrepris. C'est par rapport A ce niveau de
reference que seront mesures les avantages decoulant de l'execution du projet, c'est-a-dire des
investissements de la JIRAMA dans la remise en etat des centrales et du reseau de transport et de
distribution. Une premiere estimation du niveau de reterence, ainsi que les indicateurs de mesure
des avantages decoulant du projet - c'est-a-dire les ameliorations apportees sur tous les plans
production, transport, distribution, disponibilite, fiabilite, efficacite, qualite du service, etc. -
seront communiques a la Banque a la mi-juillet 1994. Apres avoir defini ce niveau de reference, la
JIRAMA calculera les taux de rentabilite ex post en tenant compte de la date de cloture du
31 decembre 1994.
3.           La mission a pu proceder a une analyse preliminaire de l'investissement de la
JIRAMA dans l'informatique, dont le taux de rentabilitd interne a ete calcule avec reserve i 19 %.
Cette analyse prend en compte la totalite du couit d'investissement par rapport aux avantages pour
un seul des cinq ldments prevus dans le schema directeur informatique de la JIRAMA. Ces
avantages sont les suivants: i) exploitation assainie par suite d'une rdduction du manque a gagner
grace a des releves plus efficaces des compteurs, a un raccourcissement du cycle
facturation/recouvrement et a une meilleure gestion des stocks et du fonds de roulement; et
ii) economies decoulant de la prise en charge par la JIRAMA de services jadis sous-traites.
Renforcement institutionnel de la JIRAMA
6.           Hydro-Quebec International a aide la JIRAMA a mettre en place un systeme de
planification de 1'expansion au moindre coCit (PEMC), qui a joue un role primordial dans la
preparation du PDSE par la JIRAMA. Soulignons que la JIRAMA a ega]ement donne suite aux
recommandations des etudes relatives a la tarification de l'e1ectricite en fonction du coOt marginal a
long terme (CMLT) et a la simplification des tarifs. En janvier 1993, la JIRAMA a aussi instaure
un systeme d'ajustement automatique des tarifs (le Ministere de l'6nergie n'a et consulte qu'apres
coup) en fonction des variations du cout des combustibles, de la hausse des prix a la consommation
et des fluctuations du taux de change. Bien que la JIRAMA ait reussi a simplifier sa structure
tarifaire - tout en maintenant des tarifs differents pour les clients haute tension, moyenne tension et
hasse tension dans les trois zones - les fortes subventions croisees entre regions demeurent un
obstacle majeur au redressernent de sa situation financiere.



-3 -
7.           La lacune la plus serieuse dans l'execution du projet est la non-rea]isation des
objectifs visant au retablissement de l'equilibre financier de la JIRAMA. Cette carence est surtout
due i) a des tarifs insuffisants, ii) au probleme persistant des arrieres du Gouvernement aupres de
la JIRAMA, iii) au maintien d'une politique de surinvestissement au niveau des installations et de
1'equipement, iv) au fait que la JIRAMA est tenue de desservir des zones odi la demande est faible
alors que le prix de revient est eleve, sans pouvoir obtenir la compensation voulue ou pratiquer les
tarifs qui s'imposent, et v) a des pratiques comptables insatisfaisaintes, notainment en ce qui a trait
a la reevaluation de l'actif de la JIRAMA.
8.           Les pratiques comptables de la JIRAMA soulevent plusieurs questions qui
compliquent I'analyse financiere de 1'entreprise. Etant donne que I'actif est sous-6valu6,
I'amortissement et, par consequent, les tarifs, sont insuffisants du point de vue economique. En
outre, le fait de ne pas reevaluer l'actif constitue une violation de l'accord de projet, empeche le
respect de la clause relative au taux de rentabilit6 financiere, affaiblit le capital social de
l'entreprise et, si la situation n'est pas rectifiee, risque meme de porter prejudice au statut de la
JIRAMA en tant qu'entreprise durable. La JIRAMA pretend toutefois que cette situation a surtout
.te caus6e par la Banque qui, une fois l'actif reevalue, a reduit de 450.000 dollars EU a
250.000 dollars EU le montant budgetise au titre de l'assistance. Enfin, vu les pratiques
comptables de la JIRAMA, il est difficile de determiner le montant total de ses investissements.
Cela s'explique partiellement par le fait que certaines remises en 6tat de grande envergure sont
ddduites sur une base nette du compte "provisions pour renouvellement" sous la rubrique "capitaux
propres" dans les etats financiers de la JIRAMA. Si lon rectifie ces ecritures et si l'on applique
aux apports a l'investissement la definition normale de la Banque - au lieu de la clause mal ddfinie
de l'Article 4.02 (d) (iii) de l'Accord de projet, qui exclut le fonds de roulement - I'apport de la
JIRAMA est nul ou negatif depuis 1990. La situation serait plus grave si la JIRAMA n'avait pas
accumule ses arrieres aupres de l'Etat au titre du service de la dette, ou si elle n'avait pas beneficie
de remises au titre de credits bilateraux. Nonobstant la situation financiere de la JIRAMA, on peut
s'attendre a ce que le projet contribue dans une large mesure a son renforcement institutionnel.
Renforcement institutionnel du MEM
9.           La mission s'est reunie avec le Directeur de ['Energie, qui a 6te nomme en
novembre 1993. Elle a souligne qu'il etait important d'accomplir un effort soutenu pour renforcer
la capacite institutionnelle de la DEN en matiere de coordination de la planification energetique et
de la politique sectorielle, compte tenu de la reorganisation intervenue dans divers services durant
l'execution du projet. La mission souhaiterait egalement que les personnes ayant beneficie d'une
formation soient affectees a des postes oi l'investissement dans le capital humain qu'elles
representent soit directement applicable a leur travail, notamment pour mener a bien le PDSE, qui
reprend les initiatives du Projet Energie I. Le Directeur a tenu a rassurer la mission en precisant
qu'il etait le seul a n'avoir pas travaill6 a la DEN auparavant. La mission a egalement
recommande que la DEN coordonne la disponibilite et l'change d'informations avec les divers
organes places sous sa direction, afin de renforcer la synergie de travail et d'assurer la continuit6
voulue une fois que les consultants seront partis.
10.          Le d6marrage de l['l1ment 6nergetique du projet ayant 6et retarde. les tonds de
contrepartie en monnaie nationale provenant du programme d'investissement public (PIP) PL480 de



-4 -
I'USAID (clos le 31 decembre 1992) accusent un deficit. La DEN estime que la quote-part en
monnaie nationale des engagements pris dans le cadre du Projet Energie I s'elevera a plus de
900 millions de FMG a la fin de 1994. D'apres l'USAID, le Ministere de l'Economie, du Plan et
du Redressement Social (MEPRS) avait conseille a tous les ministeres dont les budgets
comprenaient des fonds provenant du programme PL480 d'utiliser ces derniers avant le
30 septembre 1993, les sommes inutilisees devant etre reportees sur les exercices 1994 et 1995 du
PIP, puis reaffectees a la discretion du MEPRS. Le solde inutilise initialement affecte au MEM
s'eleve, d'apres l'USAID et le MEPRS, a 288 millions de FMG. La mission a suggere que le
MEM et le MEPRS etudient la possibilite de: i) reporter ce solde de 288 millions de FMG sur
l'exercice 1995 du PIP, ii) prier l'USAID d'envisager la possibilite de cofinancer retroactivement
le cout en monnaie nationale des activites entreprises dans le cadre du Projet Energie I qui ont ete
extremement benefiques sur le plan environnemental, et iii) demander au Ministere des finances un
credit budgetaire additionnel pour couvrir le deficit que les co(ts en monnaie nationale devraient
connaStre d'ici a la fin de l'annee.
Element 6nerg6tique
11.         La mission a felicite l'Unite de Planification de l'Energie Domestique (UPED)
d'avoir execute avec succes les sous-elements qu'elle avait pris en charge et d'avoir depasse ses
objectifs initiaux. Le programme de fabrication du foyer econome (FE) a charbon de bois devrait
produire un taux de rentabilite interne qui, meme selon une estimation prudente, depassera les
38 %. Le programme FE contribuera aussi accessoirement a reduire la pauvrete - principal
objectif de la Banque dans le domaine du developpement - dans la mesure oui ceux qui beneficient
directement des avantages decoulant de ce programme (estirmes a 46.000 FMG par famille selon
l'indice des prix de 1993) appartiennent souvent aux couches les plus defavorisees de la societe.
Les autres realisations de l'UPED comprennent notamment la quantification de l'equilibre entre
l'offre et la demande de bois de feu dans la region d'Antananarivo, et le transfert de connaissances
techniques a ses homologues a travers le pays.
12.         Les autres aspects de 1'le6ment energetique sont plus difficiles a evaluer en ce
moment. En ce qui concerne 1'etude sur la possibilite d'accroltre le rendement energetique dans
l'industrie, la mission a passd en revue les questions que le bilan energetique industriel a soulevees
a la PAPMAD concernant le projet pilote. La PAPMAD s'y interesse en principe, mais. vu la
situation macroeconomique actuelle, elle estime que le moment est mal choisi pour un
investissement d'environ 2,5 millions de FF a Madagascar. La reussite de ce sous-element
dependra de la mesure dans laquelle l'industrie appliquera les recommandations du rapport, qui
feront l'objet d'une campagne de promotion organisee par le Comite malgache de la maitrise de
1'energie (CMME). La mission a suggere que le CMME - qui doit se reunir a la fin de
juillet 1994, soit 6 mois plus tard qu'il n'etait prevu - souligne non seulement les avantages
financiers. mais aussi les avantages technologiques decoulant des investissements envisages, vu la
possibilite d'ameliorer la qualite du produit et d'accroitre ainsi le potentiel d'exportation. La
PAPMAD a toutefois reitere les doutes emis par l'industrie au sujet du programme de chaudieres
electriques. qui avait ete ecarte du projet en 1989. Globalement, le remplacement du bois par des
combustibles modernes dans l'industrie est gene par les ecarts sensibles entre les prix des
combihustibles, et par le fait que les depenses energetiques ne representent qu'une faible partie des
trais d'exploitation des petites et moyennes industries a Madagascar.

13.         En ce qui concerne les autres initiatives de l'element energetique, I'etude entreprise
en vue de la planification regionale energetique du lac Alaotra (PRELA) est arrivee a la conclusion
qu'une centrale a bois de 1 MW serait l'installation la moins colteuse pour l'alimentation en
electricite a court terme. Cette centrale pourrait utiliser regulierement le bois de dechet et les
autres residus que laissent les travaux de maintenance courants de la FANALAMANGA. Quant au
sous-elment FANALAMANGA, ses objectifs etaient mal definisdes le debut du projet, mais cela
n'etait pas evident lors de l'evaluation. Dapres l'UPED, on ne manque pas vraiment de bois de
feu a Antananarivo, dont 1'approvisionnement est regulierement assure par des plantations privees.
D'ailleurs, les consommateurs preferent la combustion de l'eucalyptus k celle - plus rapide et plus
intense - du charbon de pin des plantations de la FANALAMANGA. Cette derniere a r6cemment
signe trois contrats qui lui permettront de fournir mensuellementjusqu'a concurrence de
1.100 tonnes de charbon de pin a l'industrie - ce qui contribuera a ameliorer le taux de rentabilit6
ex post du sous-projet et les perspectives commerciales de l'entreprise - et se trouve peut-etre dans
une situation propice pour exploiter des marches d'exportation regionaux, etant entendu que cela
pourrait exiger des investissements compl6mentaires. De ce sous-element se degage toutefois une
lecon importante: on ne doit pas privilegier le developpement d'un marche pour un produit
inferieur (le charbon de pin) fabrique par une societe d'economie mixte, meme si les installations
existantes sont inemployees ou sous-utilisees au moment ou se decide l'investissement, lorsqu'un
march6 prive efficace et competitif fabrique deja un produit superieur et moins codteux (le charbon
d 'eucalyptus).

Objet: RAPPORT D'ACHEVEMENT DU PROJET ENERGIE I
PARTIE ENERGE
L'evaluation du Secteur Energie, entreprise en 1985 avec le concours de la Banque
Mondiale, demontrait I'absence de planification dans le chois des investissements prioritaires du
Secteur Energie. Le manque total de donnees chifflres ne permettait pas une analyse objective de
la situation energetique nationale. En consequence, la politique du Secteur energetique n'est pas
claire et les actions dans ce domaine sont confuses et ne favorisent pas le developpement
harmonieux du Secteur en conformite avec la Politique Economique du Pays.
Le Projet ENERGIE I, (Partie Energie executee par le MEM) avait pour objectifs:
- Formulation d'une politique energetique nationale;
- Mise en valeur des ressources energetiques localement disponibles;
- Gestion efficace de la Demande et de l'Offre d'Energie;
- Amelioration du Systeme d'organisation institutionnelle du Secteur.
Le Projet ENERGIE I consistait en:
- La mise en place d'une cellule de Gestion de Projet (UGP/MEM);
- La mise en place d'une equipe de planificateurs en energie;
- La mise en place de l'unite de Planification de l'Energie Domestique;
- L'elaboration d'un schema standard de Plannification regionale de I'Energie et etude
de cas d'electrification rurale;
- L'etude de la consommation energetique industrielle;
- L'etude du placement des energies exc6dentaires de la Biomasse ligneuse.
Etant donne que le Projet est termine fin Decembre dernier, essayons de trouver ci-apres le
tableau synthetisant les resultats obtenus par rapport aux objectifs par Volet de la Partie II du Projet
en y mentionnant les performances acquises.

Malgr6 la defaillance du Budget PL480 en cours d'execution du Projet, qui a quelque peu boulevers6 la
bonne marche du Projet ENERGIE I (Composante Energie), les objectifs sont presque atteints.
Ces objectifs ont ete atteints grace a leur comprehension par les differents intervenants d'une part, et
d'autre part, par l'assistance technique et l'encouragement fournis par la Banque Mondiale aux diff6rents stades
de Realisation du Projet; ceci a permis le transfert du savoir faire qui permettra aux agents du MEM de piloter
eux-memes par la suite des projets similaires.
Aussi, etant donne que le Projet ENERGIE I ait ete la phase d'orientation generale du Secteur Energie, le
Projet ENERGIE 1I serait donc, logiquement, la phase d'action proprement dite. C'est a travers le savoir-faire
acquis durant le Projet ENERGIE I que vont se realiser les diverses composantes de l'ENERGIE II. Cette
realisation permettra au Secteur Energie de jouer pleinement son r6le dans le processus de developpement
economiquement et ecologiquement durable du Pays.

RAPPORT SUR L'ACHEVEMENT DU PROJET ENERGIE I
Nota: Durant la Gestion du Projct Energy I, outre les rapports de Mission do Supervision des Bailleurs de fonds,
une TRENTAINE de rapports trimestricls avcc Ies donndes chiffr6cs techniques et financieres detaillees, et TROIS
rapports BILAN-Energy I ont did emis par la JIRAMA et son consultant. Pour les d6tails chiffres on pourra donc
s'y rdfdrer.
- Le prdsent rapport rendra surtout compte do l'expdrience acquise par la JIRAMA. pendant le
ddroulement du projet, qui sera donc traitd dans sa globalite. tout financement confondu (BM. BEI. CFD, BADEA,
SUISSE).
11 essaicra d'etre Te plus objectif et Ie plus transparent possible, sans aucune complaisance. aui risque do
paraitre parfois trop critiquc, peut-6ire, mais avec constamment Te souci de rechlrcher de meilleures performances
encore pour Ies futurs projets.
C'est pourquoi. ct en guise de PREALABLE, il convient do souligner que, GLOBALEMENT, les
performances du projet ont ele plus que SATISFAISANTES pour les Exploitants de la JIRAMA. Les r6sultats sont
Ia pour Ie prouvcr, et le Bilan final essaiera do chiffre cc qui se sorait passer sur IT Service Public de l'Eicctricitd
SANS Energy I.
Le Chef de Projet profilera do l'occasion pour adresscr. au nomn do toutcs les Unilts, leurs meilleurs
REMERCIEMENTS a tous les BAILLEURS do Fonds, car apres un d6but hdsitant ils ont TOUS, sans exception,
fail preuve de beaucoup dc CONFIANCE et COMPREHENSIONS. Sans quoi cc projet. coinplexe de par la
multiplicitd des domaines qu'il intercssait. n'aurait pu etre mene ainsi a tcrme, et sans incidents.
1- CONCLUSIONS GENERALES
En RESUME, los lecons et suggestions a tirer dc la GESTION de ENERGY 1- pour les projets FUTURS,
sont:
- Confiance des Bailleurs de Fonds stir ]es capacites ct I'Expdrience de la JIRAMA
- Effort constant de la JIRAMA pour profilter de I'Enrichisseomient de son Savoir-Faire le conserver et le
d6e\ loppcr
- Etudes en Prdalables a toute action. mais cllcs doivent etre Pertinontes et ddboucher sur des realisations
Concrtles
- Consultants a titre de Conscillers. d'Assistants ct d'Expcrts. avoc obligations de resultats et ne doivent
pas dtre substitucs au "Maitre d'Ouvrage".
a) Si Ie projct ENERGY I n'avawt pas dti mis en place les centres d'exploitation de la JIRAMA auraient
dtd ETOUFFES par la carence dcvonuc chroniquc:
* des Pieces de Rechangos pour maintcnir ou remettre en dtat ses moyens de production et de transport
cl
* des matcricls ndccssaires au renforcement et au d6v eloppement de son rescau de distribution. La
PENURIE en devise empdchaii alors depuis deux a trois ans la JIRAMA de disposor de ces moyens
pourtant v itaux pour son activild.
Tous Is rapports de Mission des Bailleurs, et Is Diagnostics des Consultants (de 1986 a 1989) dtaient
Unanimes pour signaler la precarite do la situation des exploitations. et annonqaient uil Wrs proche
elfondrement du Service ou louaicnt, selon Ie cas, les efforts deployes par l'Exploitant pour maintenir ses
installations en vie.
b) Lc deroulement du projet a connu quclques difficultds pendant Ies premieres annecs de demarrage.
Elles sont duos essentiellement a



3
1- une meconnaissance des capacites reelles de la JIRAMA et des cadres par les Bailleurs de Fond;
2- F'inexperience de la JIRAMA dans la gestion de credits interssant ainsi PLUSIEURS branches des ses
activites a la fois: Exploitation. Equipement. Planification, Tarification, Informatique, Comptabilite;
3- a la lourdeur des procedures administratives
c) Au 31 decembre 1994, il y a eu 268 contrats signes (donl 104 finances par la BM pour 14,500 KDTS,
101 par la BEI pour 14.200 KECU, 10 par la BADEA pour 5,384 KS, 6 par la SUISSE pour 3,100 KFS, et 47
par la CFD pour 59,580 KFF). Pres de 1000 factures ont ete dmises et traitees.
La JIRAMA a du repenser entierement son organisation de la Gestion du Projet pou pouvoir traiter un tel
volume de documents, en particulier en intdgrant TOTALEMENT, et comme tete de file, les Services
Exploitation et en assurant toute la logistique et le traitement informatique par les Unites Specialisees et
Distinctes.
Cette organisation est evidemment perfectible, et la JIRAMA fera profiter les projets futurs de
l'experience et des lecons du passe.
d) Energy I a amene un assainissement financier et une augmcntation notable de performances et du taux
d'activite de la JIRAMA, comme le montrent les resultats suivants:
1- Jusqu'au 31/12/93 la production a augmente en 5 ans de 24,4% (429 a 534 GWH), pres de DEUX fois
PLUS que la periode de 5 ans anterieure qui a precedd El.
2- 28000 Kw, soit 30% du parc de production, en nombre de groupes, ont pu etre rdhabilites grace
A Energy I
3- De 1988 a 1993, le nombre d'abonnes s'est accru de 28500, soit 3,5% par an, contre 25% auparavant
4- La Consommation Specifique moyenne en combustible s'est amdliorde de 5gr/kwh (244 a 239 gr/kwh)
5- Les recettes sont passees de 28,5 Milliards de fmg en 1988 a 87,5 en 1993.
e) Cependant les travaux de renforcement des reseaux de Distribution n'ont pas pu suivre le rythme
d'augmentation du nombre d'abonnes, en particulier parce que le financement en a dtd bloque pendant presque
un an par la CFD, pour cause de conditionnalite non remplie par l'Administration pour le reglement de ses
impayes.
En consdquence les rendements des reseaux, en particulier a Tananarive ont continud a DIMINUER d'une
facon alarmante, et ce jusqu'a present (85,8 a 81,5%).
f) Actuellement, en pdriode de fin du projet, il faut attirer I'attention des Bailleurs sur les points suivants
qui creent des points durs dans sa gestion:
1- Suspension des paiements des factures par la CFD et BADEA
11 est parfaitement comprehensible que les bailleurs de fonds appliquent les clauses de suspension
du Crddit, sur des contrats A VENIR, quand des conditionnalitdes n'ont pas ete respectees.
Ces suspensions ne devraicnt cependant pas concerner les contrats EN COURS, dont certaines
prestations (services ou fournitures) ont deja etd effectuees, donc elles sont DUES.
Ceci porte prdjudice a la crddibilite de le JIRAMA en particulier aupres de ses fournisseurs,
d'autant plus qu'elle n'a pas ete la cause de la suspension et qu'AUCUN contrat n'a pu htre mis en vigueur
sans l'accord PREALABLE du bailleur lui-meme.
2- Clbture du Credit B.M.
11 est normal dgalement, pour eviter les ddbordements et respecter les rigueurs comptables, que
les dates de cl6ture des credits soient imperatives et respectdcs.
Pour une infime partie cependant, qui consiste en l'occurrence a l'envoi de reliquat de maldriels,
ou a finaliser une prestation dans le mois ou les deux mois apres la cl6ture, peut-etre qu'une exception
pourraient etre toleree dans Ic rTglement des factures y affdrentes, pour que le dossier puisse etrc ferme sans
incidents de paiement.
11 est certain que, dans ces deux cas precedents, la JIRAMA se doit d'honorer ces factures par ses
propres movens. Mais les raisons de refus de paiement des bailleurs quoique parfaitement legitimes ne sont pas
forcement bien comprises.



4
g) II fuit convenu avec le chef de mission de la Banque au moment du changement du Chef de
Projet a la JIRAMA, que les depassements de montant d'un contrat doivent etre exceptionnels. Aucun
depassement n'a eu lieu sur aucun des contrats que le chef de projet a eu a gdrer.
h) Les relations JIRAMA-BAILLEURS de fonds, etaient assez difficiles au ddbut. 11 y avait une
INCOMPREHENSION mutuelle. (meme certains membres des premieres missions ne parlaient pas le
Francais), due,
* d'un c6td a la meconnaissance, donc la mefiance, des bailleurs sur les capacites rdelles des
cadres de la JIRAMA;
* et de l'autre a l'inexperience de la JIRAMA sur des projets aussi vastes.
Par la suite, la confiance est venue quand la JIRAMA a commence a faire ses preuves, et les
relations sont memes devenue tres cordiales, ce qui a grandement faciliter le deroulement du projet.
i) Des ETUDES realisees par un bureau d'Experts exterieurs etaient une Condition PREALABLE
a tout ddblocage de fonds. C'est pourquoi les Etudes furent nombreuses et ont engagd un montant relativement
important du Crddit.
If a dtd constate que la duree de ces etudes doublait pratiquement lorsque la JIRAMA ne s'etait
pas, ou n'a pas ete, impliqude d'une facon consequente.
11 est certain que la JIRAMA a eu un net enrichissement de son savoir-faire apres toutes ces
etudes. II lui appartient dorenavant de preserver cette augmentation de la competence de ses agents.
j) Le Projet Energy I devrait d'abord en priorite s'interesser a la REHABILITATION des
installations.
C'est pourquoi, la FORMATION a du passer en second lieu bien que l'on se soit toujours efforce
de l'inclure dans presque tous les contrats.
11 en est de meme en ce qui concerne la mise en place d'un systeme rationnel et moderne de
MAINTENANCE des installations.
De cc fait il a ete reservd dans le prochain projet ENERGY une large part du financement pour
ces deux volets. 11 reste maintenant a le concrdtiser, car la Formation et la Maintenance sont les plus sfirs
moyens de perenniser une Rchabilitation.
k) Pratiquement toutes les Evaluations des offres ont re,u I'approbation des Bailleurs des leur
Premiere presentation. Les raisons en etaient que, le Directeur de la production lui-meme ayant passe plusieurs
mois avec un consultant de la Banque specialiste des procedures de la redaction et de passation des marches,
ces procedures ont dte parfaitement comprises et appliquees a la lettre.
D'autre part, les recommandations des commissions de depouillement ont toujours ete enterinees,
sans modifications, par la Direction Generale. aucun conflit non plus n'a ete enregistre sur ce plan.
Un point merite d'etrc signale, au profit des projets a venir:
Les fournisseurs sous-evaluaient les cofits des Assurances et Frets au moment de l'appel d'offre,
cc qui faussait Ics resultats. Aussi, il a fallu recourir au syst6me de couit Assurance et Fret PLAFONNE, au-
dcla duquel Ic fournisscur devait prendre a sa charge le surplus.
2- DEROULEMENT DU PROJET
DEMARRAGE DIFFICILE
Durant les Trois premieres annces dc leurs mise en vigueur, les Credits Energy I n'ont finance
cssentiellement que des ETUDES.
Les Bailleurs s'inquictaient en effet de savoir. a cette epoque, si les besoins exprimes alors assez
maladroitement par la JIRAMA, et qui se chiffraient a plusicurs dizaines de Millions de Dollars,
CORRESPONDAIENT reellement a ses PRIORITES, tellement ces besoins etaient nombreux, disparates et
prdsentes dans le ddsordre.
Ceci denotait en fait l'etat critique de toutes les activites de la Societe a cause de cette penurie chronique
en devise et en consequence I'ETOUFFEMENT des Centres d'Exploitation, pour qui la premiere urgence



5
n'dtaient meme plus ses Pieces de Rechanges. mais ses moyens de DEPLACEMENT. C'est pourquoi, outre les
depenses pour Etudes, parmi les tous premiers achats de matdriels sur le Crddit 1787-MAG, figuraient les
VEHICULES.
Aussi les Bailleurs de fonds. Ia Banque Mondiale en premier lieu, imposerent que des ETUDES soient
d'abord mendes par des Consultants externes pour permettre d'v voir un peu plus clair. Et seuls les chapitres
ETUDES du Crddit dtaient donc LIBERABLES.
ETUDIER des ETUDES
II v a eu d'abord l'expression sommaire de ses besoins par la JIRAMA. Ensuite les rapports des Experts
successifs de la Banque Mondiale. le rapport ESMAP, et apres, les divers dossiers des Bureaux de Consultants.
Ces dossiers successifs n dtaient pas discordants, mais concluaient A des montants A chaque fois plus
importants des besoins, jusqu'a ddpasser les 100 Millions de Dollars, alors que les crddits qui pourraient etre
disponibles s'dlevaient tout au plus a 50 millions de Dollars.
II ffit de nouveau ddcidd d'engager un autre Bureau d'Etude pour consolider tous ces dossiers et
determiner un critere de priorisation des besoins. Ce consultant ffit alors chargd d'etablir un PROGRAMIME
d'EQUIPEMENT au MOINDRE COUT... Ie PEMC.
Entre temps les Exploitations continuaient A pdricliter on dtait en 1989, TROIS ans apres la signature des
Conventions de Crddit. Aussi, suite A une demande pressante des Exploitants les credits ont commencd a etre
ddbloquds, mais seulement pour l'achat de matdriels classds Urgents.
REORGANISER LA GESTION du PROJET
En fdvrier 1990 la Banque Mondiale  IvPOSA LA DATE LIMITE DU 30 Mars pour que la JIRAMA et
ses Consultants dmettent enfin les premiers dossiers d'Appel d'Offre.
Aussi, apres que l'Equipement ait assurd la mise en place des financements grace A ses expdriences
acquises avec les Amdnagements d'Andekaleka et de la Namorona,
afin que le Gestionnaire ait dgalement une autoritd hidrarchique sur le Rdalisateur, la Gestion du Projet fuit
alors confide, et coordonnee au niveau le plus dlevd possible, aux Exploitants eux-memes qui d'une part
ddtenaient et dominaient les informations et d'autre part seront les realisateurs.
Enfin, ENERGY I devait mettre en ocuvre plusieurs CENTAINES de contrats, contre une dizaine au plus
pour un nouvel amdnagement, il a donc fallu revoir et repenser entierement le systeme de gestion du projet
EVOLUTION des APPRECIATIONS de la BANQUE MONDIALE.
L'Exdcution du projet s'est amdliorde au fur et A mesure de son avancement. Les rapports des mission
successives de surveillance de la Banque Mondiale dont on reprend ci-dessous les principaux dldments rendent
compte au mieux de cette evolution.
1- Des Etudes doivent etre mendes en PREALABLE A toute action concrete. La Banque s'inquiete des
retards, et recommande mdme de nouveau 1'embauche d'un consultant pour accdldrer les procddures selon les
rapports de:
- Fevrier/Mars 89 ("..sauf les travaux classds Urgents, tous les autres doivent attendre les rdsultats des
etudes sur le PEMC).
- Aouit/ Septembre 89 ("..L'etude tarifaire n'a pas avancd d'un maniere satisfaisante..")
- Octobre/Novembre 89: "I'Execution du Projet Energy I a subi d'importants retards.  lls sont dus en
partie a l'insuffisance des fonds de contrepartie, et aux procedures administratives Malgaches... aussi les
marchds pour 1990 doivent etre soumis A la Banque avant le 15 Mars 90... La preparation du projet Pilote de
Distribution par Hvdro-Quebec a dtd fortement retardde.."
..."La Banque recommande alors d'engager des CONSULTANTS pour Etablir les Appels d'Offre,
accelerer la passation des marchds, ASSURER l'execution des travaux..."
2- La Banque enregistre des progres dans le ddroulement du projet A partir de 1990:
- AvrilVMai 90... ("La Banque enregistre le changement du Chef de projet, indique des progres sensibles
dans son deroulement, accepte le principe que la JIRAMA assure l'essentiel des actions, et que les consultants
soient des "CONSEILLERS uniquement dans les domaines ou l'Expertise Extdrieure est Indispensable..". Le
R6le de HQI dans le Projet-Pilote sera A rendgocier...)
- Novembre 90... (les evenements de progres constatds par la Banque dans son aide mdmoire sont: La
Sous-Station de Tana Sud (CFD) a dte operationnelle le 31/10/90; - Les contrats Majunga, Nosy Be,
Antsiranana (BEI) ont dte signds; - La rdhabilitation de Tuldar (CFD) se termine...)
On commence alors A parler de ENERGY 2



6
"La mission tient a feliciter les Ingenieurs de la JIRAMA des progres realises sur le Projet Pilote de
Distribution.". "La JIRANvA est a feliciter sur la reorganisation de ses procedures d'entretien."
3- Le Deroulement du projet a atteint son rythme de croisiere en 1991 bien que durant cette annde, des
evenements Socio-Politique se soient ddroules a Madagascar. Mais le Projet El a ete classe PRIORITAIRE car
tout Ic personnel, meme greviste...
- Septembre/Octobre 1992 ...("la Mission a note avec satisfaction que l'execution du projet a beaucoup
progresse notamment dans les 6 derniers mois...La Banque a requ des rapports reguliers et de qualite de l Unite
de Gestion et la Mission voudrait exprimer ses compliments au Chef de Projet et son equipe pour les travaux
rdalises pour la Mise en Oeuvre et la Gestion du Projet.."
- Fdvrier/Mars 93..("L'execution du Projet El continue de progresser de maniere satisfaisante.. La mission
desire exprimer sa satisfaction avec le travail realise par l'Unite d'Execution..")
- Novembre 93..("I n'y a pas de problemes particuliers dans 1'execution des composantes El JIRAMA
"..et la Banque recommande que les paiements des factures soient acceleres...")
Nota: Cette acceleration des paiements, ainsi que le Souci permanent de ne pas depasser les Enveloppes de
Credit ni la Date limite d'utilisation fixee au 31/12/94, seront les principales recommandations des Missions de
Supervision de la Banque durant l'annee 94.
3- LES ETUDES
II est entendu qu'un projet aussi vaste et complexe que ENERGY I ne pouvait se faire sans une partie
ETUDE serieuse et tres consequente.
Ainsi, plusieurs Etudes ont ete menees durant le projet. La grande majorite a ete parfaitementjustifiee:
car a indeniablement permis de realiser correctement les travaux de rdhabilitation auxquels Energy I
devrait etre consacre et accessoirement a egalement apporte un enrichissement dans le SAVOIR-FAIRE de la
JIRAMA.
Quelques Etudes cependant auraient pu avoir de meilleurs resultats s'il n'y avait pas eu cette
incomprehension mutuelle au debut du projet. Deux ou trois ont ete arretees ou confides a un autre consultant
apres une premiere phase non concluante.
II convient de rappeler que les ETUDES etaient, au debut, et pour tous les Bailleurs une condition
PREALABLE a tout Deblocage de fonds. Ce ne ifit qu'en 1990, apres que le projet ait marque le pas d'une
facon alarmante, et que la JIRAMA ait rassure sur ses capacites de le gerer convenablement, que cette attitude
se fut assouplie.
Ce changement dans la conception des Etudes a eu une influence tres importante dans le deroulement des
projets, car on a remarque que lorsque la participation de la JIRAMA n'a pas ete assez importante, le delai
d'Etude etait pratiquement DOUBLE. En effet, les consultants devaient d'abord commencer par "connaitre la
JIRAMA", ensuite essaver de comprendre le probleme pose lui-meme, avant de se mettre a y reflechir. Ce qui
prenait un temps relativement important.
Ainsi pour les projets finances par la BANQUE, la BADEA, la BEI, la SUISSE, rien que les etudes ont
demande TROIS ans, voirc plus pour la SUISSE (5 ans, etudes specifiques et complexes).
Alors que pour la CFD. qui, il faut signaler, connaissait mieux la JIRAMA de par des projets anterieurs
qu'ellc a finance. Ics projets Tana-Sud et Tulear, dont les etudes ont ete menees integralement par la JIRAMA,
sc sont ddroules en TROIS a Quatre ans. Etudes et Travaux compris.
Dans certains cas mdmc. lcs exploitants ont du prendre les devants pour faire avancer le projet (Lister des
travaux d'urgence en attendant le PEMC, arrdter les etudes HQI sur le Projet-Pilote, faire changer de methode
dc travail Ic Consultant Thermiquc. diminuer les Prestations du Consultant Hvdro, ctc...)
En analvsant Ics Ordrcs de Virement on releve quelques points significatifs:
Ics conventions de pret Banque Mondiale ont ete signees en 1987. De 1988 jusqu' en 1990, les Ordres de
Virement nc concernaient que des factures d'Etudes. Ce fut seulement en 1990, suite a l'insistance des
Exploitants, que quelqucs matcrieIs classes Urgents ont ete approvisionnes et que des travaux concrets ont ete
commences. Le restc devait attendre la fin du PEMC, qui etait en retard.
Lc gros du matcriel Wa vraiment commence a arriver que durant I'annees 1991. Le projet ENERGY I se
scrait donc en definitive deroule pratiquement en QUATRE ans.
Ccci ctant dit. ces Etudes malgre leurs nombres, montant et conditions de realisations parfois, etaient dans
leur grandc majorite, necessaires et bdnefiques. passe en revue ci-dessous les plus importantes, avec leurs points
les plus determinants:



7
- ASSISTANCE TECHNIQUE a la PLANIFICATION (ATP) ct PEMC
- L'ATP a perrms d'acquerir des m6thodes nornialisec pour etablir Ics PREVISIONS dc la dcmande. et
pour evaluer des PROGRAMM4ES d'Equwpment en Production en particulicr (programmc WASP)
- 11 faut signaler cependant que les resultats auraient pu etre meilleurs si les termes de reference avaient
itait suffisamment contraignantes quand a l'obligation de rdsultats.
- Dc meme le PEMC a subi un retard important car Ie logiciel d'Etudc (WASP). impose par la Banque
etait encore inconnu et par le Consultant et par la JIRAMA.
- TARIFICATION
Ces ctudes Tarifaires ont permis d'obtenir une Simplification remarquable du systeme existant puisque les
438 tarifs. ont etc reduits a 24. avec une indexation sur trois parametres simples (Taux de change. Prix du Gas
oil. Indice des Prix a la Consommation).
Nota: 11 convient de noter ici cependant. que lEnergie Electrique n'est pas seulement un facteur Economique,
mais tient aussi un r6le important dans Ic d6veloppernent Social.
Aussi, et a notre avis. une fois assuree la condition primordiale de la viabilite financiere de la Socidtd. Ie
Tarif devrait evoluer quant a son niveau en Harmonie avec l'environnement Economique gdndral du pays.
En effet. les augmentations successives actuellcs des tarifs. ne semblent plus etre supportables par les
consommateurs, ct une IMPLOSION du Senrice Public est a craindre.
- REHABILITATION des CENTRALES. des LIGNES, et de la TELECOMMUNICATION:
Ces Etudes ont permis des expertises detaillees des Installations. de les Justifier d'une fa,on rationnelle et
chiffree au-devant des Bailleurs en confirmant les inquietudes des Exploitants, et de realiser les rehabilitations.
Les methodes d'expertises ont ainsi dte acquises egalement par les agents.
- PLANS DIRECTEURS RESEAU PLAN DIRECTEUR INFORMATIQUE:
Ces Plans Directeurs en cours de Concretisation actuellement servent de ligne directrice au developpement
de ces svstemes.
Plusieurs phases ont ete prT&ues. [es premi&res sont termindes ou en cours. tandis que les autres attendent
la mise en place du projet Energ, suivant.
- MAINTENANCE:
Une Etude sur la Mise en Place d'un Svsteme Rationnel de Maintenance des installations a dtd entamec
dans sa premiere phase.
Malheureusement, il a fallu renonce a la phase suivante. evalude a un cout bien trop elevd (plus de 40
MNFF), d'autant plus que les points de vue du Bailleur, de la JIRAMA et des Consultants ne concordaient pas
sur l'dtendue des actions a r6alfscr
La JIRAMA a commened cependant a cxploiter Ies resultats de l'dtude par des actions ponctuelles en
mettant en place dans quelques centres des tableaux d'entretien
- CHAUDIERES ELECTRIQUES
Pour engager plus rapidement toute la capacite installee d'Andekaleka. des Etudes d'utilisation de
Chaudieres Electriques ont cte menees   Malleureusemetll. aux Nxues des coits de la transformation, les
utilisateurs potentiels de ces chaudieres ont prefdre garde leurs installations existantes  Le projet f6t donc
abandonne.
Nota. Dans cette optique d'utiliser au mieux Ie Potentiel Hydrodlectrique du Rescau Interconnecte, I'alternative
d'un Svstrme de Transport en commun par TROLLEY-BUS a Tananarive a ete lanc6e aupres d'une Mission de
la Banque. ceci permettrait en meme temps de diminuer d'une facon non n6gligeable Ies besoins en Gas-Oil de
la Capitale.
Cette suggestion devait etre transmise au departement Transport de la Banque
- GESTION DE PROJET:
Un consultant a dtd engage pour ddfinir un Syst6me de Gestion du Projet Energy I.
Suite au changement du Chef de proJet. il est apparu a celui-ci. que l'Etude en question ne satisfaisait pas
entierement les besoins. 11 a done, mis en place unc Unitd specifique de Gestion du Proict El et une cellule



8
Informatique distincte, et s'est attele a concevoir et mettre en application un Systeme Informatisee de Gestion
du projet, ce qui a permis jusqu'a present de:
gerer les 268 marches, le Millier d'Ordres de Virement, de connaitre a tout instant la situation et de
chaque Contrat et de chaque Credit, d'integrer les variations des taux de Change et d'etablir des previsions de
soldes pour parer a tout risque de depassement.
- PROJET PILOTE DE DISTRIBUTION
Le Projet a dtd confide initialement a Hydro-Quebec International. Mais suite a une mdsentente dans le
choix du lieu d'experimentation du Projet (HQI voulait I'appliquer directement sur le reseau Tananarive), le
Projet est reste bloque.
Les Exploitants ont alors demande a la Banque de prendre eux-memes en charge cette dtude et de faire
appel a la STEG (Societe Tunisienne d'Electricite et de Gaz) pour les nouvelles techniques MALT qu'il fallait
experimentees et que cette Societc connaissait.
- ETUDES D'AMENAGEMENT HYDROELECTRIQUE:
- Rehabilitation de la centrale de VOLOBE
- Plusieurs Avant-Projets pour le site d'AMBODIROKA
- ETUDES PONCTUELLES:
Acquisition d'un Logiciel pour la Gestion du Parc de Production Hydrodlectrique et Thermique du
Systeme Interconnectl (Logiciel PARSIFAL de l'EDF).
Mcthode de Contr6le des roues de turbine, et d'exploitation des mesures d'observations des mouvements
des barrages.
Gestion des Immobilisations et Gestion de la Clientele JIRAMA.
- SUGGESTIONS
Lcs Bailleurs de Fonds doivent continuer a faire confiance a la capacite de la JIRAMA de mener pour elle-
mnme des dtudes, en particulier en matieres de Lignes et Postes.
On aurait peut-etre avancd plus vite si les etudes menees par les Consultants ne concernaient que
seulement les Gros Centres (6 a 7), en laissant a la JIRAMA le soin de mener les memes etudes pour les petits
centres, et d'utiliser si besoin est les methodes determinees avec les Gros Centres.
Les Bailleurs avaient demande que les travaux a realiser soient LISTES dans le detail. Cette mdthode est
parfaitement valable si l'amenagement est NEUF, mais elle est ddfaillante pour une installation en cours
d'Exploitation dont l'etat EVOLUE constamment.
Un svst6me de Budget-Enveloppes est peut-etre dans ce cas preferable, et aurait dvite d'avoir des travaux
non-rdalises en fin de projet avec pourtant un reliquat de credit.
4- LES CONSULTANTS
COMPORTEMENT
Une DIZAINE de Bureaux de Consultants sont intervenus dans le cadre du projet.
On peut Ics classcr en trois categories:
I - Les Consultants Professionnels (COB. SOGELERG, CORT..)
2- Les Consultants appartenant a des Entreprises d'Electricit (EDF, HQI, STEG)
3- Les Consultants dc la Banque Mondiale
Les Consultants de tNpe 1. avaient besoin d'une periode de "mise au courant" tres longue, ils avaient
tendance a chercher des solutions "generales' aux problmes, et il fallait de nombreuses reorientations pour
cibler des Etudes pertinentes.
Les Consultants du Groupe 2. avaient au contraire tendance a imposer des solutions toutes faites, en
gendral cclles de leurs Societes d'origine, sans chercher a Lenir compte du contexte particulier de la JIRAMIA,
de l'historiquc ni des specificites de ses installations.
Les consultants de la Banque Mondiale etaient des Spdcialistes de Haut Niveau, ce qui entrainait des
polarisations sur des points particuliers en rapport avec leur spccialite (Dossiers d'Appel d'Offre et Marche).



9
Ainsi par exemple, alors que le delai impose du 15 Mars allait etre respecte, les experts de la Banque ont
demande qu'au lieu d'etre par projet, les dossiers d'Appel d'Offres soient redecoupds par Type de Matdriel. Ce
qui fuit refait. Ulterieurement cependant, on s'est apercu qu'il v avait, et il y encore, de grosses difficultes pour
rdpartir de nouveau les materiels par projet, comme il se doit de toute faqon avant de pouvoir entamer les
travaux.
PODS
Comme dit plus haut. les Etudes etaient un Prealable a tout deblocage de fond, plus encore, ces Etudes
devaient etre menees par des consultants Externes a la Socidtd. C'est dire le poids que ceux-ci avaient.
De plus, les experts ayant parfois des idees preconcues ou leur specialitd propre, laissent dchapper des
points importants.  Ainsi par exemple, les experts de l'ESMAP, au ddbut du Projet, avaient ndgligd
l'importance des Lignes de Transport et des Sous-Stations et ne les ont pas pris en compte dans l'affectation
des credits. Et pourtant ce sont les maillons les plus fragiles de la chaine.
La JIRAMA a du alors faire appel au service d'un expert EXTERIEUR membre de l'ECTI (association de
retraites bdnevoles) pour que Postes et Lignes aient pu finalement etre pris en compte dans le Credit.
RETARDS
De 1986 a 1989 on attendait les resultats qui tardaient a venir et ces retards s'accumulaient.
En fait le projet n'avanqait pas et parfois tournait en rond:
Les Consultants devaient d'abord commencer par "apprendre" la JIRAMA, et parfois les mdthodes
d'6tudes imposdes par les Bailleurs de fonds (cas du WASP), ou dlaborer des mdthodes pour analyser. certains
problemes.
Parfois ces mdthodes se rdvelaient inadequates, ou les etudes insatisfaisantes, il fallait alors refaire le
travail ou changer de consultant (Projet Pilote).
Ce ne fMt que lorsque la Banque accepta en Avril 90 que les Consultants soient des "CONSEILLERS"
uniquement dans les domaines ou l'Expertise Extdrieure est INDISPENSABLE, et considdra que les avis de la
JIRAMA avaient egalement "Valeurs" d'avis d'Experts que le projet commenca reellement a dvoluer.
INCOMPATIBILITE
La JIRAMA demanda alors aux consultants de changer de methode pour etre rdellement des Assistants et
Conseillers. Et a la place des Etudes de Conception, leurs competences furent mises a contribution pour trouver
les solutions a des problemes tres precis avec des etudes ponctuelles que la JIRAMA ne pouvaient pas mener
elle-meme.
La notion d'obligation de resultats fMt introduite dgalement dans les contrats.
Certains Consultants, (EDF, SOGELERG), se sont adaptds a la nouvelle mdthode qui priorisait la
concrdtisation a la perfection d'une dtude. D'autres comme COB ont eu beaucoup de difficultes, meme pour
dmettre des rapports ou des factures sous des formes imposees par la JIRAMA. Enfin pour certains, commne
IIQI, CORT, CGE, qui ont prdfere camper sur leur position sans transiger, les contrats ont du etre interrompus,
ou non renouveles pour cause d'incompatibilite.
JIRAMA
La JIRAMA a du suppleer parfois aux Consultants pour apporter son experience des problemes
d'exploitation ou meme ses connaissances en planification.
Ainsi, sans son intervention pour sortir elle-meme un dossier URGENCE en 1990, le retard aurait dte
encore plus important dans I'attente du PEMC.
De meme, sans les adaptations preconisees par les Exploitants et relevant d'un bons sens acquis par
l'expdrience, le programme WASP n'aurait pas pu sortir un PEMC rdaliste. En effet, WASP avait des lacunes
pour traiter les problemes de mouvements de groupes de production entre centrales, ainsi que leur
remplacement en fin de duree de vie.
5- LES TRAVAUX
On se reportera aux Rapports Trimestriels ou aux rapports de Bilan pour connaltre les details sur les
Travaux. Seuls les travaux les plus importants et les Resumes par Unitd de Realisation seront repris ici.



10
PRODUCTION THERMIQUE
Rehabilitation de la Centrale de Tulear, avec un regroupement des moyens de production dans une seule
centrale au lieu de Deux precddemment.
Rdhabilitation de la centrale de Majunga, avec des revisions-modernisations des groupes MAN,
reamdnagement et modernisation de cellules MT, installation d'un groupe de 4,5 MW venant de Tulear donc
extension du batiment pour l'abriter.
Rehabilitation des centrales d'Antsiranana et de Nosy Be, et renovation des auxiliaires, avec l'apport d'un
nouveau groupe de 1,6MW pour Nosy Be.
Rdhabilitation de 30% de l'ensemble du parc de production, avec les auxiliaires, pour l'ensemble des
autres sites.
PRODUCTION HYDRAULIQUE
Les travaux ont subi des retards importants du fait de la complexitd des etudes.
Volobe: fiabilisation de la partie amont de la centrale (Canal d'amenee et Hydromecanique)
Antelomita et Mandraka: fiabilisation, par la revision des alternateurs et des regulateurs de vitesse,
rdnovation des auxiliaires, contr6le detaille des turbines.
Namorona, Vatomandry, Ankazobe, Tsiazaompaniry, Manandray: divers travaux qui ont permis de les
maintenir en service malgre leur vetustd, car leurs contributions restent encore appreciables sinon necessaires.
RESEAU DE TRANSPORT
Des acquisitions de materiels et d'outillages de maintenance ont ete realisees, ainsi que, des actions de
flabilisation (Rcmplacement de poteaux ct d'armements, renovation complete de portions de lignes)
POSTES SOURCES
La realisation la plus importante a ete la mise en place de TANA SUD, qui assure depuis son installation
la majcure partic de l'alimentation de Tananarive.
Les autres postes ont did rehabilites en particulier au niveau contrble-commande, avec extension des
bhtiments pour certains.
Trois postcs sources en Region, ont eu leurs tableaux de commande et leurs cellules completement
rdnoves.
RESEAU DE DISTRIBUTION
On rcl6vc les principaux travaux suivants en longucurs de lignes: 22 KM en lignes HT, 300 KM en MT,
3400 KM cn BT.
44.566 branchements outt ete realises en BT et 261 en MT. L'Objectif fixe dans El pour realiser 10.000
branchcmcnts par an a donc ete pratiquement atteint. peut-etre meme depasse s'il n v avait pas eu toutes ces
difficultcs de demarrage du projet.
Un programme de modcrnisation de la conduite du reseau en vNuc de minimiser les temps de coupure est
en cours de realisation (systcmc de tclcconduitc du reseau a partir d'un Bureau Ccntrale de Commande). Cc
programmc a subi un retard important pour cause de Suspension de Credit de la CFD.
Un projet PILOTE de Distribution d'Encrgic en vue dcessayer lc svst&mc MALT en zone rurale. est en
cours d'cxpcrimcntation depuis Septembre 94 a,cc 220 abonnes contre 900 de prevus. a causc apparemment du
montant encore trop clcv du co6t de branchement. Aucun probleme lechnique majeur n est apparu jusqu a
present gricc a l'insistance dc la JIRAMA pour isoler clectriquement cc nouveau si steme du rescau existant de
Tananarive.



11
RESEAU DE TELECOMMUNICATION
Ce reseau a fait l'objct d'un developpement important qui a ameliore nettement les conditions de gestion
des divers centres.
Ainsi le reseau de Tananarive a ete dote d'un systeme telephonique de securite reliant toutes les centrales
aux postes sources et les centres de contr6le.
SIX reseaux VHF ont ete mis en place et QUATORZE centres sont relies enfin par BLU entre eux et avec
Tananarive.

Ref.: Votre lettre du 23 f6vner demier
1) Vous rernercions pour le prcjet d'ICR sur le projet energie I a Madagascar.
2) Par'Lageons dans 1'ensemble ses conclusions. notamment le cote globalement satisfaisant du projet,
et la r6alisation des objerifs prevus, notamment sur I'amelioration de la capacite technique de
JIRAMA. et sur le taux de disponibilite des generateurs lectnques.
3) Partageons aussi votre analyse financiere, sur les retards de paiement entre l'Etat et Jirama
(factures d'elecncite et dettes rdtrockd6es). Avons deja sugg4r4 une compensation de ces creances
croisees, qui nous parait une priontte. Une re,evaluation du bilan de JIRAMA. surtout depuis le
flottement du FMG, seirait aussi opportune.
4) Avons de notre c6t& estime a 4 ans le retard du projet, d'une part A cause des trcubles de 1981 que
vous avez mentionnnes, d'autre part suite aux retar:ls des etudes de base 'plan d'expansion a moindre
coXt". De plus, considerons qu'une partie des investissemerns 'distnbution d'6nergie' prevus n'est
toujours pas rdalis4e.
5) Les fonds BEI comprencient deux tranches de prets, toutes deux au gcuvemement
- pret A, convertible de 13,5 Mecus, entierement ddbcurs6, taux d'interet 2 %, remtcurseement sur 20
sernestrialites A partir du 15.8.93.
- pret G, conditionnel de 2 MWcus, entierement debourse fin decernbre 1994. taux d'intdrdt 1%.
remboursement en 2 tranches les 15.12.96 et 15.6.97.
Le pret A hlait destine a r'ttude 'plan directeur" et au materiel de telecommunications internes a
JIRAMA, et a l'extension du reseau de distribution; I'essentiel a donc finance des depenses en
devises.
Le pret B dtait destine a pernettre l'importation de pieces de recnange, en contrepartie de monnaie
locale A payer par JIRAMA.
Une conversion du pret A en c3pital, comme prevu dans le contrat, est en courJ.
6) Enfin suggerons que sodt mentionne I'inttrAt qu'a eu le projet pour i'environnement, notamment en
arr4tant les fuites d'huile et fuel des vieilles centrales qui se deversaient directement dans des zones
de peche a la crevetse, ou en reduisant la pollution atmosphenque.
Meilleures salutations.
