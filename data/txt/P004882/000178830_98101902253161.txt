REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPUILAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendations on a proposed
loan to the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for the equivalent of
US$47 million to help finance a second education project. The loan would
have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2
percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Economic Development and Prospects of
Algeria" (900-AL) was distributed to the Executive Directors in November,
1975. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        In 1966, Algeria's Revolutionary Council defined the fundamental
objectives which the country intended to pursue during the period ending
1980. These are: (i) to expand and organize the production base, enabling
the economy to reach, by about 1980, a stage of self-sustained growth with
full employment; (ii) to achieve economic independence, which implies that
the country would rely first on its own resources for development, although
international economic relations would be expanded and diversified; and (iii)
to improve income distribution, particularly among regions. These objectives,
and the strategy which has evolved towards their implementation, take into
account the country's physical and socio-economic potential; the country's
leadership is deeply committed to them.
4.        To attain the objectives defined in 1966, Algeria has adopted a
long-term strategy with four main aspects. The first is industrialization,
which is viewed as the principal means of achieving the long-term growth and
employment objectives, as the scope for expanding agriculture rapidly is
limited by physical and social constraints. Several essential functions are
assigned to industry in this perspective: first, to produce and process
natural resources, particularly the sizeable reserves of hydrocarbons (oil
and gas), for export to earn foreign exchange; to produce modern equipment for
use in all economic sectors; and to provide essential consumer goods required
to raise the living standards of the population. The second aspect of
Algeria's long-term strategy is the introduction of structural institutional
changes to keep the economy in Algerian hands, as a means of imparting
dynamism to investment and production. The main structural reforms are the
application of central planning to the economy as a whole, the expansion of
the role of public enterprises in industry and services, the Agrarian Revolu-
tion involving land and livestock redistribution to poor farmers and the in-
troduction of cooperative management in agriculture, decentralization in

favor of local government, and the participation of workers in the management
of state enterprises. The third element of Algeria's long-term strategy is
the acceleration of training and education to meet the skilled manpower needs
of the economy, improve employment opportunities, and develop an authentic
Algerian culture. The fourth and final element of Algeria's strategy is
austerity in consumption, to generate national savings for investment and
avoid excessive recourse to external sources.
5.        In the seven years, 1967-73, which constituted the first phase of
implementing the above strategy, structural reforms and investment were push-
ed with vigor. The Government acquired nearly complete control of economic
activity through the systematic nationalization of foreign assets, including
those of foreign oil companies, and through the creation and expansion of
public enterprises. Total investment increased from 15 percent of GDP in
1966 to nearly 40 percent in 1973, public sector investment rising from 9
percent to 36 percent with more than half going to industry. In agriculture,
farms left vacant by departing foreigners in 1962 (about 2 million hectares)
have been managed by their workers under central planning and control, and
since 1971 the private agricultural sector (about 5 million hectares of cul-
tivated land and 20 million hectares of steppe pasture) has been progressive-
ly brought under the provisions of the Agrarian Revolution. Education and
training were rapidly expanded and improved. The school population rose from
1.5 million in 1966/67 to 2.9 million in 1973/74 while the education and
training systems were progressively modified to improve their efficiency,
their relevance to economic needs and their accessibility to the largest num-
ber of Algerian children and workers.
6.        Algeria's strategy also yielded some less satisfactory results.
First, the real growth of output was below target (about 6 percent per year
as against a target of 9 percent) in the 1970-73 period, mainly because of
delays in implementing many projects or in bringing their output to design
capacity. and due to poor agricultural performance. Second, the sectoral
imbalance in investment caused bottlenecks in lagging sectors such as construc-
tion, transportation, communications and housing. Third, while the unemploy-
ment rate in non-agricultural sectors declined from 27 percent in 1966 to 12
percent in 1973, the number of emigrated workers increased to about 440,000
in 1973, when emigration was officially stopped. In agriculture, slow output
growth was accompanied by an increase in underemployment; about 9 percent of
the agricultural labor force was officially considered to be seriously under-
employed in 1973, compared with 4 percent in 1966. Thus, in 1973, providing
jobs for unskilled labor continued to be a worrisome problem, while the shortage
of skilled and experienced nationals was a primary restraint on investment and
efficient management. Fourth, due to sharp differences in sectoral and regional
development, disparities in income levels and living standards have persisted;
for instance, in 1973, per capita consumption was estimated at $130 on average
in rural areas compared to $450 in urban areas. The impact of these differences
is, however, smaller than in most other developing countries at Algeria's level
of development due to the strong income and price controls and substantial free
social services.
7.        The increase in oil prices during the last quarter of 1973 boosted
Algeria's receipts from its main export product, crude oil. Although, due



- 3 -
to production difficulties in the last four months of 1974, crude oil output
and exports declined in quantity by about 9 percent bet:ween 1973 and 1974,
export receipts from hydrocarbons rose from $1.6 billicon in 1973 to an esti-
mated $4.3 billion in 1974. The additional $2.7 billion ($190 per capita)
which Algeria derived from hydrocarbons in 1974 greatly improved the balance
of payments. Despite the rise in the import bill due to sharp increases in
import requirements (30 percent) and prices (35 percent), Algeria was able
to repay in advance a part of the commercial bank loans it had contracted in
1972 and 1973, and to increase its foreign exchange reserves by about $550
million during the year. There was a corresponding improvement in the domestic
financial situation, particularly in the position of the Treasury, which captures
most oil revenues. But, due to import price rises and domestic pressures, price
inflation accelerated to an annual rate exceeding 10 percent. The financial
improvement was accompanied by continued GDP growth in 1974. The decline expe-
rienced in crude oil output was more than offset by the sharply increased level
of investment, new output from industrial projects and the recovery of agricul-
tural production from the low level of 1973. GDP growth is estimated to have
been around 7 percent in real terms, and nearly 55 percent in current prices
due essentially to the oil price increase. With the liberalization of consumer
goods imports, private consumption growth was rapid (more than 10 percent),
while national savings also rose sharply.
8.        The improvement in Algeria's financial situation and prospects led
the Revolutionary Council to envisage an acceleration of the pace of economic
development and structural reform during the second Four-Year Plan (1974-77).
On the basis of the physical implementation capacity likely to be available,
the Plan estimates that total investment should reach at least DA 85 billion
($20.4 billion) in 1973 prices during the 1974-77 period, and thus be about
2.3 times larger than during the 1970-73 plan. The Plan also specifies a
higher (maximum) investment target of DA 110 billion ($26.4 billion), with
supplementary projects to be undertaken if implementation capacity can be
raised above the estimated minimum level. The share of industry and hydro-
carbons in total investment would decline to 44 percent in 1974-77, from 54
percent in 1970-73, while the relative importance of other sectors would in-
crease. Based on the expected outputs from sectoral investment programs, the
Plan fixes a minimum (11.2 percent a year) and a maximum (12.5 percent a year)
GDP growth target. The projected growth of investment and output would, ac-
cording to the Plan, create enough new jobs to improve the employment situation
substantially. The Plan estimates that the unemployment rate in non-agricul-
tural sectors would decline to around 4 percent in 1977, while there would be
a marked reduction of underemployment in agriculture.
9.        The Plan also provides for an acceleration of consumption growth
and a reduction of regional disparities. It estimates that private consump-
tion should rise by 11.3 percent a year over 1974-77, compared to a growth
rate barely equal to that of population (3.3 percent) in 1970-73. On a per
capita basis, the growth rate of private consumption would be higher in rural
areas (9.6 percent a year) than in urban areas (5.5 percent a year) as a re-
sult of increases in expenditures on rural development and social services.
While the Plan projects import requirements to rise at constant prices by 21
percent a year in response to the rapidly rising demand for investment and
consumption, it expects export receipts to be large enough to leave a small



- 4 -
surplus on goods and non-factor services for the 1974-77 period as a whole.
Thu,-. the Plan does not anticipate any foreign exchange constraint, nor any
difficulties in domestic firancing.   Hawever, it does foresee that the re-
source balance would deteriorate after 1974 and turn into deficit by 1977.
10.       From the viewDoint of physical implementation capacity, the minimum
target for investment appears to be within reach. The orientation of the in-
vestment strategy in favor of lagging sectors and regions is highly desirable
An view of the difficulties that have appeared with the past heavy emphasis
on industry. Hlowever, the estimate of implementation capacity on which the
Plan's investment target is based implies that short-cuts will continue to
be t-m.en In the preparation of many projects with adverse consequences for
implementing and bringing them to planned output.   In part for thIs reason,
but also because of the high proportion of projects with long gestation pe-
riods in the investment programn (e.g. hydrocarbon production, petrochemicals,
and heavy metal, mechanical and electrical industries), the delay between
irxresi-ment and the accrual of benefits is expected to lengthen temporarily.
Indeed, the Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR) implied by the Plan's
rnnimrum projections of investment and output tends towards 5.0 by the end
o; :he Plan period compared to less than 4.0 on average in the 1967-73 period.
t,xurthar, while the employment situation wlll probably improve substantially
between 1973 and 1977, the investment cost per additional job is fairly high.
On the basis of Plan estimates in 1973 prices, it is about $38,000 in 1973
orices in the non-agricultural sectors, and around S25,000 in agriculture.
i" the same time, and in spite of the large planned effort further to accele-
rate edtucation and training, the supply of skilled nationals will continue to
be significantly short of projected needs at the high, and especially at the
rm-ddle, levels of qualification.  The Government is taking a number of measures
to alleviate the problems created by this situation, including the introduction
of inproved financial and other procedures to bring about better operational
r-;-ults on the part of enterprises, and the extensive use of international
cooperation to help in project implementation and carry out extensive on-the-
b   -ralning of nationals.   It expects that the imianagement of assets will
4,ipruve progressively after the current Plan period when the supply of skilled
rf-_.:.crls is expected to catch up with needs and the beneficial effects of
or-ganizational improvements are increasingly felt.
,1;.      An unusually wide margin of uncertainty surrounds the prospects for
h-,ifocarbon export receipts which are to finance most of Algeria's import re-
cuirements. This uncertainty concerns the strength of external demand for
crude oil and natural gas, the policies that Algeria and other OPEC countries
muay rollow concerning the volume and prices of oil production, and the tech-
.,cal problems still being encountered in oil production and large-scale gas
liquefaction for export. Whereas the 1974-77 Plan expected that during the
Flan period Algeria's crude outDut would rise by 4.7 percent per year and the
pirchasing power of Algerian crude on international markets would remain at
the level reached at the end of 1973, these crucial assumptions have not been
borne out by developments in 1974 and 1975. Due to technical and economic
factors, crude oil output declined to an annual rate of 45 million tons in



1975 from 50 in 1973, and the realized price of crude exports also declined
from an average $13 per barrel in early 1974 to less than $12 in 1975. Re-
ceipts from hydrocarbon exports declined to less than $4.0 billion in 1975,
from about $4.3 billion in 1974. While the growth of receipts should resume
in 1976 and later years, particularly with the expected recovery of crude oil
output and new exports of natural gas, such growth is likely to be signifi-
cantly less rapid than anticipated in the 1974-77 Plan.
12.       Meanwhile, in 1975, Algeria has iiiiplemented the ambitious investment
strategy of the Plan, causing a rapid increase in import requirements, and
the appearance of sizeable external borrowing requirements.   The current ac-
count of the balance of payments, which experienced a surplus of about $180
million in 1974, showed a deficit estimated at more than $800 million in 1975.
To finance this deficit and keep reserves at the leveL needed for confidence
and liquidity, Algeria borrowed on a commitment basis some $3.3 billion from
external sources in 1975.
13.       In later years, the investment effort that Algeria can undertake
will depend mainly on the level of hydrocarbon export recaipts--the country's
main source of investible funds. It will also depend more indirectly on the
efficiency of domestic production for import substitution and exports. And
there will be a need for austerity in consumption policies. In the light of
export vrospects and other factors, the Government has decided that in 1976
public investment appropriations by the budget and annual plan would be kept
at the same level as they were in 1975 (i.e, DH 26 billion ecuivalent or ap-
proximately $6.5 billion). This decision may result in a decline in real
investment in 1976, which would ease somewhat the pressures on the balance of
payments that developed in the course of 1975. While Algeria's economic and
financial prospects are particularly difficult to forecast beyond 1976, since
they will depend on uncertain domestic and external factors (mainly the rate
of investment, its efficiency, and the level of hydrocarbon export receipts),
it seems likely that Algeria will continue to have sizeable external borrow-
ing requirements until the early 1980's, when the large export projects con-
cerning gas and petrochemicals are expected to make a substantial contribution
to export receipts.
14.       Algeria's total external debt, outstanding and disbursed, was
$3.3 billion ($6.1 billion including undisbursed) at the end of 1974. It rose
further to some $7.0 billion ($9.2 billion including undisbursed) at the end
of 1975, due to heavy external borrowings made in 1975. Debt service, is esti-
mated to have fallen from 14.4 percent of exports of goods and non-factor
services in 1973 to about 10 percent in 1975. Depending on the investment
strategy which Algeria may choose and the level of hydrocarbon export receipts,
the ratio would rise to a level between 17 and 19 percent of exports by 1980.
It would follow a gradually declining trend in the 1980's when the large gas
and petrochemical projects generate increasing exports. Algeria's external
borrowing needs are large in the next few years, but can be accommodated in
view of the considerably enhanced capacity to carry debt which the country
has acquired as a result of the new relationship betw-een the prices of hydro-
carbons and other commodities in world markets, and of the long-term pros-
pects for gas and petrochemical exports.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ALGERIA
15.       Lending to Algeria resumed in FY73 and by January 1976, the Banlk
had lent $356.5 million in seven loans for transport, power, education, in-
dustry and rural development.   Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans as of December 31, 1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
While the physical execution for most project is progressing well, effective-
ness and disbursements for some of them have been slow. Increasing familiari-
ty with Bank procedures is expected to lead to a better record on this account.
16.       The Bank's future lending to Algeria can only meet a small part of
its considerable external financial requirements, as detailed above, though
in FY 1976 it is expected substantially to exceed the relatively low FY 1975
level of $48 million which resulted from delays in project preparation. At
the end of 1974 the portion of Algeria's total debt outstanding and disbuirsecd
owed to the Bank was less than one percent; this share will rise over the next
years, but is expected to remain well below 10 percent at the end of the
decade.
17.       The provision of technical assistance and institution building sulp-
port in connection with lending operations remains a major objective in the
Bank's strategy in Algeria, to which the Government attaches special impor-
tance. The aim is to assist the Government to relieve bottlenecks in lagging
sectors, such as transportation, education and rural development, and to ex-
pand the contribution of institutions in these areas to national development.
Bank operations will also systematically attempt to introduce sound criteria
for project preparation, appraisal and implementation, and to aid Algeria in
making more economic use of its resources. Finally, future lending will also
aim at reducing sectoral imbalances in support of the socio-economic trans--
formation of Algeria which the Government is undertaking, particularly in the
rural areas. The two FY 75 loans to Algeria in support of the regional in-
dustrial development program through the Banque Algerienne de Developpement,
and for technical assistance in rural development, are initial steps in these
directions. However, the level of awareness and tmderstanding of the Bank's
methods of work varies considerably among government agencies and the estab-
lishment of a program of Bank lending operations has proved a complex task.
The dissemination of the objectives of the Bank's activities in Algeria will
continue to require a close dialogue with the Government and sustained Bank
lending to meet these objectives will call for substantial strengthening of
project preparation in the executing agencies.
18.       In the present fiscal year, in addition to the loan of $46 million
for a cement expansion project approved by the Executive Directors last Decem-
ber and to the project proposed in this report, a second power project is ex-
pected to be presented to the Executive Directors. For subsequent years, fur-
ther projects in education, highways, ports, rural development, and for on-
lending to industry, are under discussion with the Government.



-7-
19.       As the present project exemplifies, nearly every project to be
presented to the Executive Directors is expected to have one or more techni-
cal assistance components. In addition, special technical assistance activi-
ties have included a joint Bank-IMF mission which visited Algeria in the
spring of 1974 at the request of the Government, to study the financial plan-
ning system. Acting on one of the mission's recommen,iations, in late 1974
the the Economic Development Institute held a course In Algeria dealing with
various aspects of financial planning at the central government, banking and
project levels.  The authorities showed considerable interest in this course.
At their request, the EDI is organizing a project course, with the Government
bearing the cost, in April 1976, and may organize further ccurses as well.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
20.       Education in Algeria fulfills both social arid economic objectives
that are crucial to the country's chosen development strategy.    The social
objective is to provide a common education base to all, through nine years
of fundamental education, and adult literacy programs, using an increasingly
Algerian teaching force and employing Arabic as the principal language. The
economic objective is to provide sufficient technical an(d vocational training
resources at the secondary and post-secondary levels to satisfy the economy's
growing need for skilled manpower.
21.       The formal education system in Algeria is being restructured to
reduce the academic orientation of the inherited French model and to enable
it to produce the scientific and technological high school graduates that are
more relevant to an industrializing economy. In 1970, the secondary cycle
was divided into a first cycle of four years, followed by a second cycle of
three years. In addition, the content of both fundamental 1/ and secondary
education has been modified to provide a balanced common core program that
nevertheless brings out special aptitudes of individuals, ensuring their
adaptability for further training. Under the 1974-77 Plan, fundamental level
curricula will be broadened to include sciences, agriculture, industrial arts,
and home economics. New specialized secondary schools will provide courses
of one to three years with a strong vocational basis, and the expanded en-
rollments of the universities will be reoriernted towards engineering and
sciences.
22.       Prior to independence in 1962, only 10 percent of the jobs requiring
technical and professional skills outside the agricultural sector were held by
Algerians. The departure of the French population after independence resulted
in severe manpower shortages, particularly in the manufacturing sector, in
which technical expertise was essential, and which has grown to provide 25
1!   Fundamental education extends over grades 1-9 and is divided into two
cycles - elementary education (grades 1-6) and polytechnic education
(grades 7-9).



- 8 -
percent of Algeria's GDP and 17 percent of total employment today. The Gov-
ernment has, therefore attached high priority to educational spendirig since
1963/64, with enrollments increasing twofold in primary education, seven-
fold in secondary education, and over fifteenfold in higher education, there-
by raising the literacy rate from 10 to 25 percent over the last decade. Be-
tween 1970 and 1973, public expenditures on education annually averaged 9
percent of GDP and absorbed approximately 30 percent of the Government's cur-
rent budget. The 1974-77 Plan, which provides for increased enrollments in
fundamental education (from 21 percent to 32 percent of the age group), reor-
ientation of secondary education, the development of new technical schools
for vocational training, and the expansion and reorientation of tile univer-
sity system.  It represents the first phase of a long-term reform program
calling for an average annual increase of total public expenditures on edu-
cation of at least 11 percent per annum in real terms over 1973-85, which
would lead to education and training spending of about 9.4 percent of pro-
jected GDP in 1985. The rapid expansion and reform of the education system
has resulted in some imbalances and bottlenecks. There is a heavy reliance
on expatriate consultants for the physical preparation of projects, without
sufficient guidance and control by the government; as a result, projects are
sometimes overdesigned and costs are frequently hligher than necessary. Re-
course to e;patriate teachers is widespread (45 percent of the teaching force
in lower secondary education, 59 percent in upper secondary, and 55 percent
at university level).   In spite of government efforts to improve the situa-
tion, there are inequalities in the distribution of educational opportunities
between regions, and partly because of cultural reasons, girls have consti-
tuted only 39 percent of those enrolled in primary education since 1963.
At the university level, only 20 percent-of students graduate.
23.       Given the lead time required to implement the comprehensive reform
of Algerian education, the Government recognized that measures had to be taken
to increase access to education, and to improve its efficiency and output in
order to meet the most urgent needs for trained manpower. Thus, in 1969 the
decision was taken to create a new type of secondary level education institu-
tion, the Technological Institutes, which are intended to train both middle
level technicians and specialized professionals. This is an innovative form
of training in several ways: admission is based on work experience as well
as examination standards; programs are based on actual job requirements, and
curricula combine classroom and on-the-job training, with examination proced-
ures designed to test practical competence rathet than academic proficiency.
Since 1970, technological institutes have been set up for mining, petroleum
technology, agriculture, commerce, planning, tourism, public works, mechanics,
topography, public health, and telecommunications, each under the authority
of the technical ministry concerned. The first Bank education project is
concerned with the improvement of three such institutes and provided techni-
cal assistance for a pre-investment study of a fourth. Implementation of
this project initially suffered delays, due to ineffective liaison with the
Bank and differences within the Government concerning the planned reorganiza-
tion of post-secondary agricultural education. However, liaison and perform-
ance have improved over the recent past and this trend is expected to continue.
To avoid duplication of effort and problems of jurisdiction and realizing that
any further expansion of the system of technological institutes needs to be



integrated with post-secondary education as a whole, t:he Algerian Government
has decided to gradually transfer jurisdiction of the institutes from the
respective technical ministries to the Ministry of Higher Education and
Scientific Research. In the long run, as the university system becomes more
responsive to the economy's manpower needs, most, if not all, technological
institutes are to be absorbed into the university syst:em.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       The proposed project was identified in JanuaLry 1975, and prepared
by the Government, with the assistance of consultants. It was appraised in
June 1975. Negotiations took place in Washington in J'anuary 1976. The
Algerian delegation was headed by Mr. Rachid Hassam, Director General of the
Ministry of Finance. A report, entitled "Appraisal of a Second Education
Project in the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria" (No. 1007-AL,
dated January 27, 1976) is being distributed separately. A Loan and Project
Summary is attached as Annex III.
Purposes and Description of the Project
25.       The nroposed project is intended to reinforce the expansion and re-
organization of technical education in response to Algeria's skilled manpower
needs, and to provide essential technical assistance that would be the basis
for reforms in four other priority areas: fundamental education, general
secondary education, vocational training and higher education. It would
follow up the first education project, approved in 1973, which brought im-
provements to three technological institutes supplying technical manpower
for agriculture, mining and metallurgy, and the oil sector. Substantial Bank
participation in the financing of the University of Oran had initially been
contemplated as a major component of the project; however, the Government,
on the advice of foreign consultants, proposed physical facilities that far
exceeded in terms of size, standards, and costs, what would have been justi-
fied for the university. Therefore, this component was not retained in the
proposed project. The project would include:
(i) Construction, furnishings, equipment and related technical
assistance for a new Technological Institute of Electricity
and Electronics.
(ii) A study of Algeria's needs through 1980 for high level engineers
and technicians, in particular for electrical and electronics
specialists.
(iii) Technical assistance for primary and secondary education reform.
(iv) Pre-investment studies on the development of vocational training
centers and on the development of an establishment required to
meet the need for vocational training instructors.
(v) Pre-investment studies on automated data processing and on the
introduction of modern technology in higher education.

Institute of Electricity and Electronics
26.       The Institute of Electricity and Electronics at Tlemcen would have
an enrollment capacity of 3,000 students, 1,000 in engineering courses of
five years' duration, and 2,000 in technician courses of four years' duration.
This would result in an annual output rate of about 190 engineers and 440
technicians providing about 50 percent of the projected average annual demand
for such skills in the early 1980s. The institute would be the only one of
its kind in Algeria, producing urgently needed specialists in the area of
power and process control systems. In return for free tuition, subsidized
boarding, and a pre-salary, students would be expected to work in the public
sector for at least 10 years following graduation, and would receive their
diploma only at the end of that period.
27.       The Institute would be administered by a Director General reporting
to the Minister of Industry and Energy through the Directorate of Hiuman
Resources. Initially, the Director General would be advised by a steering
committee comprising representatives of the institutions involved in its
planning. in addition, in order to ensure a permanent dialogue with tile
users, the Government would establish an Advisory Council composed inter
alia of public enterprise representatives to provide guidance on manpower
needs, curricula, practical training and evaluation, within one year of the
signing of the Loan Agreement (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.04(c)). The
Government would also ensure that. not later than two years after loan signing,
a tracer system is established in the Institute to monitor premature termina-
tion of studies, repetition, and employment and advanced studies of graduates
(draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.04(a)).
28.       The Institute's curricula, which provide for practical training
periods in industry, were designed in cooperation with the public enterprises
to ensure immediate relevance to industrial needs. English will be used as
the language of instruction, and accelerated upgrading courses will be used
to supplement language training received in secondary school; at capacity,
the Institute will require 200 teachers. Initially, teaching will be pro-
vided by expatriate staff - a maximum of 119 foreign professors would be
reached in 1981/82. About 50 of these are expected to be drawn from facul-
ties of the universities involved in the planning groups. A counterpart Al-
gerian senior staff will be developed to fill all teaching positions by the
mid-1980's. The Government has provided an assurance that procedures would
be established to ensure recruitment of the remaining teachers and that the
growth of enrollments during an initial five-year period will be consistent
with the actual recruitment of teaching staff (draft Loan Agreement, Sec-
tion 3.04(b)).
29.       Jurisdiction of the Institute of Electricity and Electronics may
be transferred to the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research,
as mentioned in paragraph 23. This may involve a potential risk that the
innovative nature of the Institute may be weakened somewhat by the more



traditional academic orientation of the Ministry. I:n this regard, however,
the Government has agreed to maintain the Institute's educational program
as presently conceived, and to exchange views with t:he Bank prior to making
any change in the objectives, curricula, operational. procedures, and admin-
istration of the Institute (draft Loan Agreement, Setction 3.05).
Study of Algeria's needs through 1990 for high level. engineers and technicians
30.       If the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research's plans
for increased university enrollments were to be realized, this might lead to
an oversupply of certain categories of technical skills.  The project there-
fore contains an in-depth study of Algeria's needs for engineers and high
level technicians through 1990. The study would be performed, with Bank
financing, by consultants acceptable to the Borrower and the Bank, on terms
of reference agreed between the Borrower and the Barnk. The study would be
completed within two years of the signing of the LoaLn Agreement. The Gov-
ernment has provided assurances that the findings and recommendations of
the study would be discussed with the Bank, and would be given due considera-
tion prior to any decision regarding further expansion of the training of
electrical and electronics engineers (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.08).
Technical Assistance for Primary and Secondary Education Reform
31.       The proposed program of technical assistance would provide the Min-
istry of Primary and Secondary Education (MPSE) with. the services of educa-
tional specialists, who would assist in the preparation of appropriate admin-
istrative and testing procedures, the design of training programs for teachers
and for key central and regionally-based administrators, the elaboration of
norms and standards, the design and evaluation of research and planning studies,
and the design and testing of learning-teaching aids. Given the experimental
objectives of the reform, the technical assistance would not be precisely
scheduled, but would be provided as required, upon the recommendations of
the Algerian authorities as the need arises. The Government has, therefore,
agreed to submit detailed annual proposals for technical assistance for the
forthcoming 12-month period, at least three months in advance (draft Loan
Agreement, Section 3.06).
Pre-investment studies on the development of vocational training centers and
on the training of instructors
32.       The objective of the first study would be to determine the extent
and nature of a national network of training centers to complement existing
facilities in order to ensure that the skilled manpower needs of the expanding
industrial and construction sectors will be met. This network would include
existing facilities operated by various ministries and public enterprises.
The study would examine (i) the needs of each technical ministry for manpower,



- 12 -
and the corresponding needs of major industrial enterprises, (ii) existing
stocks of manpower, (iii) proposals for a plan to ensure the reconciliation
of output with needs (organization, administration, criteria for decision-
making as to type of training program), (iv) location and detailed require-
ments of the individual training centers. The second study would aim at
the development of an institution which would meet the needs for vocational
training instructors. It would, in particular, consider vocational training
needs by specializations, training programs, organization and management,
required equipment, materials and facilities, detailed specifications and
estimated operating costs. The two studies would be executed by a task force
assisted by a team of expatriate experts. Establishment of this task force
is a condition of disbursement from the Bank loan for this item (draft Loan
Agreement, Schedule 1, paragraph 4 (b)).
Pre-investment studies in automated data processing and on the introduction
of modern technologies in higher education.
33.       The first study would define a model of automated data processing
adapted to the system of higher education in the country. More specifically,
it would (i) evaluate the present system and quality of data collection and
processing; (ii) evaluate administrative and planning problems posed by thle
expansion and reform of higher education; (iii) determine the administrative
and management areas and processes which can best be ser--ed Ihy in automated
system; (iv) consider the cost-effectiveness of introducing such a system and,
if found viable, elaborate an action program for the establishment of the
service; (v) define personnel requirements and initiate a personnel training
program; and (vi) plan the facilities required. The second study would iden-
tify the most appropriate teaching technologies to improve learning and pro-
mote the flow of students through the higher education system; elaborate a
program for training teachers in the use of the new media and techniques;
determine the additional physical facilities or modifications of existing
ones that may be necessary for the introduction of the new technologies;
and determine the required equipment.
Project Implementation
34.       The Ministry of Industry and Energy would be responsible for the
implementation of the Institute of Electricity and Electronics, as well as for
the program of related technical assistance, including the pre-investment
studies on the development of vocational training centers and future needs
for engineers and high level technicians. The Ministry of Labor would be
responsible for the study on the development of an institution to meet the
need for vocational training institutions. The Ministry of Primary and Secon-
dary Education would co-ordinate and supervise the technical assistance pro-
gram for primary and secondary education reform, and the Ministry of Higher
Education and Scientific Research would be responsible for the studies on
automatic data processing and the introduction of modern technologies in
higher education. Construction, as well as procurement and installation of
equipment and furniture for the Institute of Electricity and Electronics are



- 13 -
expected to be completed about four and a half years after signing of the
Loan Agreement. The various studies are expected to be com pleted within
eighteen months to two years from signing. The Projec.t Liaison Officer,
appointed for the first education project, would be responsible for coordi-
nation of activities among the various ministries and government agencies
involved in the second project as well as for providing liaison with the
Bank (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.02(b)). In addition, a committee
for the coordination and supervision of the project will he set up. This
committee would comprise representatives of the ministries concerned.
Cost and Financing Plan
35.       The total cost of the project is US$78.0 million including an in-
vestment component of US$49.1 million for the Institute of Electricity and
Electronics, a technical assistance component of US$3.9 million, and physical
and price contingencies of USS25.0 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$47.0
million would finance the foreign exchange cost of the project. Local expend-
itures would be financed by the Algerian Government. UNI)P financing is not
available for the technical assistance component. Retroactive financing is
recommended for architectural fees for the Tlemcen Institute, up to a maximum
of US$200,000, provided that the consultant architects are acceptable to the
Bank (draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, paragraph 4(a)).
Procurement
36.       Civil works contracts will be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Since Algeria has a
well-developed construction industry, it is expected that Algerian firms will
win the awards. Furniture and equipment items or categories of items costing
less than US$10,000 but in total not exceeding US$1.0 million may be procured
tnder normal government procurement procedures, which are satisfactory to the
Bank. The remaining equipment and furniture would be procured on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines ex-
cept for equipment items of such highly specialized nature manufactured by
few international firms, whose purchase through international competitive
bidding would not be practical. In the evaluation of bids, local manufac-
turers of equipment and furniture would be allowed a margin of preference
equal to the existing rate of custom duty applicable to competing imports
or 15 percent of c.i.f. prices, whichever is lower. Nearly all equipment
is expected to be obtained from foreign manufacturers, while most of the
furniture contracts will probably be awarded to local manufacturers.
Disbursement
36.       Disbursements would be on the basis of (i) 100 percent of the c.i.f.
cost for imported equipment and furniture; (ii) 80 percent of total expendi-
tures for imported, but locally purchased, equipment and furniture; (iii) 65
percent of total expenditures for locally manufactured or purchased furniture;
(iv) 45 percent of the total cost of civil works, representing the estimated



- 14 -
foreign exchange component; (v) 70 percent of total expenditures for pro'es-
sional services; and (vi) 80 percent of total expenditures for technical as-
sistance. The implementation period is expected to span six years from the
signing of the Loan Agreement.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
38.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Democratic and Popular lepublic
of Algeria and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Art.icle
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft
resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed separately to
the Executive Directors.
39.       The draft agreement conforms to the -ormai pattern for education
projects. Features of the draft Loan Agreement of special interest are
referred to in paragraphs 27 through 35 of ti,[s report.
40.        I am satisfied that the proposed loani would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
41.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Effective date: October 26, 1973; CLosing Date:
December 31, 1976.
The highway improvement works and procurement of project equipment
are progressing well. Due to the Government's reassessment of highway develop-
ment priorities, the preinvestment studies were delayed. However, the co-
ordinating consultants were appointed in June 1975 and four consulting firms
were contracted in September 1975 to carry out highway studies. Some changes
in the studies foreseen at appraisal are being made, with the Bank's concur-
rence.
Loan 913-AL    Education Project; US$6.0 million Loan of June 19, 1973:
Effective Date: October 26, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
Implementation of this project has suffered initial delays, due to
ineffective liaison with the Bank and political issues associated with the
planned reorganization of post-secondary agricultural education. The Govern-
ment has appointed a liaison officer and communications have improved in
recent months. Work is now progressing satisfactorily on the technician
centers of the Algerian Petroleum Institute. As for the planned extension of
the Institute of Agricultural Technology, the GoverTunent has made a request
for the cancellation of this project item and the reallocation of the funds
thereof.
Loan 995-AL    Port Project; US$70.0 million Loan of' June 10, 1974;
Effective Date: February 10, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Work is progressing satisfactorily and consultants are supervis-
ing construction. Disbursements are somewhate behind schedule but are expec-
ted to catch up in the near future.  The project cost, based on contracts
already received, is about the same as the appraisal. estimate.
Loan 996-AL    Railway Project; US$49.0 million Loan of June 19, 1974;
Effective Date: November 11, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
The physical execution of the project is being carried out on time.
Maintenance of locomotives and rolling stock has still to be reorganized in
order to achieve agreed operating targets. Consulting studies financed under
the loan should help SNCFA to improve the availability of locomotives and
rolling stock in the near future.

Loan 997-AL    Power Project; US$38.5 million Loan of June 10, 1974;
Effective Date: December 20, 1974i Closing Date:
December 31 _198*
The project comprises ten substations, two gas turbine stations,
despatch facilities, and consulting services for management and engineering
services. Technical progress of the project is satisfactory. All main con-
tracts have been awarded. Delays have been encountered in the provision of
financial information due to lack of experienced staff. interdepartmental
changes of personnel, and changeover to a new computer. The estimated foreign
exchange cost of the project has doubled due to (a) increases in the capacity
of the gas turbine stations, (b) price increases, (c) increased cost and
expansion of studies, and (d) exchange rate changes. In order to maintain a
well-rounded project financed by the loan, SONELGAZ proposed and the Bank has
agreed to withdraw one gas turbine station and five substations from Bank
financing.

Banque Algerienne de Developpement of September 4, 1975;
Effective Date: January 5, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
