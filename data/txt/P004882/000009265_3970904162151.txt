SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 1209-AL)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This report presents a Project Completion Report (PCR) of the
Second Education Project in Algeria (Loan 1209-AL), for which a loan of
US$47.0 million was approved on February 9, 1976. The loan account was
closed on December 31, 1981 after the undisbursed balance of US$37.24
million had been cancelled.
The Project Completion Report was prepared following a field
visit by EMENA education staff in April 1982. The director of the
principal project institution, INELEC, made a substantial input to the
report. The project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.
The PCR was sent to the Government for comment in February
1984. Comments received from the Government have been taken into account
in finalizing the report and an English translation of the comments is
reproduced as Attachment I.

ALGERIA
SEODND EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 1209-AL)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
1.       The Second Education Project in Algeria--Loan 1209-AL--provided a
loan of US$47.0 million, which was approved in February 1976, to (a) assist
in construction, furnishing, equipment and technical assistance for a new
Institute of Electricity and Electronics at Tlemcen, (b) provide technical
assistance for the Ministry of Education's (MOE) efforts to reform the
primary and secondary education sytem, and (c) finance preinvestment studies
for the Ministries of Labor (MOL), Higher Education (MOHE), Light Industry
(MOLI) and Heavy Industry (MOHI).
2.       By the Closing Date (December 31, 1981) only about 21% of the loan
proceeds (USt9.76 million) had been disbursed and the undisbursed balance of
the loan was cancelled as of March 31, 1982 (paras. 3.01 and 3.05). The
project failed to meet the appraisal objectives (under (a) above) of
creating 1,000 places for engineer training and 2,000 places for technicians
urgently required for the electricity/electronics sub-sector. Although work
is under way to create these places at Tlemcen, no firm schedule is possible
given the contractor's performance to date. Only 8% of the works have been
implemented, and no firm schedule for their completion could be determined
(para. 2.18a). The difficulties encountered in project implementation are
largely attributable to managerial and technical problems which were not
apparent at the time of contractor prequalification.    Despite the slow
disbursement record and the fact that only a limited amount (8%) of the
civil works at Tlemcen were completed by the Closing Date, the project was
successfully implemented in many respects. Specifically,
(a) INELEC has been established and is successfully functioning at an
interim facility at Boumerdas pending completion of civil works at
Tlemcen (paras. 2.01 and 2.32).
(b) Although the annual output of engineers and technicians produced at
Boumerd4s is far less than the national requirement and project
objectives, the quality of the INELEC program is excellent and
training is modern and effective (para 2.32). The laboratories of
the existing school at Boumerd4s have been updated by equipment
purchased under the loan (para. 2.29). In addition INELEC has
direct access to the latest technical information on electronics by
virtue of its use of English as the language of instruction, and
through its recently trained faculty.



- v -
(c) The educational and physical planning for INELEC was well conceived
by the architects and the Educational Development Center (EDC) of
Watertown, Massachusetts (para. 2.03). Their collaboration with
the director of INELEC was excellent. These plans will serve well
once the civil works are completed and the program at Boumerdas is
transferred and expanded at Tlemcen.
(d) By the Closing Date the proportion of INELEC faculty who were
Algerian had increased from zero to over three-quarters, due to
overseas training provided under the fellowship program
(para. 2.30).
(e) The placement/employment record of INELEC graduates is good, as
evidenced by results of the tracer system established under the
Loan (para. 2.33).
(f) The preinvestment studies funded under the loan have proved useful;
four of the five studies in fact led to Bank-financed components in
subsequent education projects (para 1.05).
(g) Technical assistance to assist the MOE in training planners,
administrators and other education specialists has been successful
and these staff are now contributing to the reform of the formal
system of technical education which is well under way (para 2.31).
3.       With regard to the construction of the Tlemcen campus, the history
is as follows: The civil works component of the project was divided into
two phases to aid implementation--Phase I included academic facilities and
laboratories Phase II consisted of dormitories, amphitheater and other
student and staff facilities. At Project Closing, Phase II was not yet
contracted.
4.       For Phase I, a contract with an Algerian contractor (the lowest
bidder, following a thorough prequalification process) was signed in
February 1979, nearly two years after construction had been scheduled to
begin. The subsequent performance of the contractor led to further delays
due to problems involving designs, labor and materials. The contractor was
unable to mobilize a sufficient and well-qualified workforce at the site.
In addition, other problems experienced by the contracting firm, including
lack of experience in dealing with foreign architectural firms and with
certain imported materials, cash-flow problems, and extensive commitments to
other on-going projects, contributed to the delays (paras. 2.24 and 2.25b).
Construction was also closed down for nearly a year when the Government
assigned priority to reconstruction following the Ech Cheliff (El Asnam)
earthquake.
5.       On the positive side, the performance of the consultant architect
was efficient. The Director General in INELEC collaborated well with the
architects. He also worked hard to resolve the construction problems at
Tlemcen although with only limited success.



- vi -
6.       The project highlights the problems facing the still evolving
construction sector notably in site management, logistics and skilled
manpower.
7.       The limited amount of equipment which was purchased under the
Second Project to update the Boumerdgs campus has been efficiently installed
and maintained (para. 2.29).

Summary and Conclusions
i.       A Bank loan (1209-AL) of US$47.0 million was extended to the
Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria in 1976 to finance a Second
Education Project, the major objective of which was to assist the Government
to establish a Higher Technical Institute for Electricity and Electronics
(INELEC) at Tlemcen, 80 km south of Oran, by financing the foreign costs of
civil works and equipment. Other components were: technical assistance and
fellowships for staff at INELEC; technical assistance and fellowships for
the Ministry of Education (MOE) in its efforts to reform the primary and
secondary education system; and the financing of various pre-investment
studies planned by the Ministries of Labor (MOL), Higher Education (MOHE),
Light Industry (MOLI) and Heavy Industry (MOHI).
ii.      The major failing of the project lay in the slow pace of construc-
tion (only 8% of the civil works at Tlemcen were completed by the Closing
Date). As a result of the organizational and financial problems that had
held back construction, the Bank and the Algerian authorities were unable to
establish a firm schedule for completion of the works. In order to tackle
these problems and achieve the target of creating 1,000 engineer-level and
2,000 technician training places within the current Plan period (1981-1984),
an ad hoc committee (Heavy Industry, Planning and Housing) has been formed
to explore possible solutions (for example, splitting the works between
several contractors). Nevertheless, there were several positive
achievements;
(a) INELEC's technical assistance and fellowship program has been
satisfactorily completed. As of school year 1981/82, 44 out of 57
faculty at the Institute are Algerian as a result of this training.
(b)  INELEC is functioning--albeit in temporary accommodations in
Boumerdas-as an effective institution, which has graduated 201
higher technicians and 47 engineers in the fields of electrical and
electronic engineering since its inception in March 1976
(Table 4). INELEC is also unique in Algeria in that it uses
English as the medium of instruction. There are several reasons
for this choice; ready access to the rapidly evolving body of
technical information on electronics; coherence between programs of
instruction and the training received by the Algerian faculty
(trained in the U.S. and the U.K.); and the ability to recruit
faculty from those countries.
(c) a tracer study (Table 3) has been introduced at INELEC, as required
under Section 3.04 (a) of the Loan Agreement, which indicates the
successful placement of the majority of the gtaduates;
(d) all five preinvestment studies were completed in a timely manner,
four leading to Bank-financed components in subsequent education
projects; and



- viii -
(e) the fellowship allocation to the MOE in connection with the
educational reform was generally well utilized.
iii.     Based on the above, it is considered that the project successfully
met, in qualitative terms, its educational objectives, but that inasmuch as
the Tlemcen campus for INELEC was not completed, a severe quantitative
constraint has been placed on the country's ability to meet its present and
future needs for higher electrical/electronic technicians and engineers.
More than 2000 applications are received from qualified school-leavers for
the 100 places available annually at Boumerdas. INELEC should therefore
remain a high priority for the Government in the future.



I. THE PROJECT
Background
1.01     At the time of appraisal, reorganization and expansion of technical
education was in line with the Algerian Government's strategy of rapid
industrialization coupled with educational reform. Responsibility for the
education and training of middle and upper level personnel employed in
specific sectors, i.e. technicians and engineers, rested with the ministry
concerned, and for that reason the INELEC component was proposed and
prepared by the Ministry of Heavy Industry (MOHI) assisted by the
Educational Development Center (EDC) of Watertown, Massachusetts. An
institution was planned with a total enrollment of 2,000 higher technician
students in four-year programs following Grade 13 of formal schooling, plus
1,000 engineer students in five-year programs following the Baccalaureate.
Annual output was seen as 440 higher technicians and 190 engineers.
1.02     During project appraisal, the Algerian Government and the Bank
agreed to locate the institution in Tlemcen (close to electronic assembly
plants in a new industrial zone), at a total cost of US$67.0 million
(including contingencies). It was to offer programs in the following
interrelated disciplines: electrical power, electronics manufacturing
processes, digital electronics and electronic communications. About US$2.0
million was allocated to foreign technical assistance in order to establish
and launch the various curricula, laboratories and workshops, plus about 50
man-years of overseas fellowships for the training of selected Algerian
faculty.
1.03     The civil works component of the project (estimated at appraisal as
US$49.93 million) was broken into two phases to aid implementation. The
first phase (Phase I hereafter) included academic facilities and
laboratories: the second (Phase II hereafter) was to include dormitories;
amphitheaters and other student and staff facilities. Preliminary designs
for Phase I were approved by the Bank in January 1977. Due principally to
delays in payment of the architects, the master plans were not ready until
November that year. Bid documents were ready by May 1978. At the same
time, some 12 firms, including one Algerian firm, had been preselected. The
lowest bidder, the Algerian firm, received a contract in February 1979
(almost two years after construction had been originally scheduled to start)
for US$57.8 million. Bids were received for Phase II in June 1979 from the
winner of the Phase I contract and from three foreign firms. However, bids
were high--two to three times the cost of Phase I per square meter--and it
was decided to declare the tender unsuccessful and proceed to direct
negotiation with individual, preselected firms. At the time of writing,
Phase II remains uncontracted. Phase I developed a series of problems:
failure of the contractor to develop site level drawings; work interruptions
due to the Ech Cheliff (El Asnam) earthquake; and above all, failure of the
contractor to effectively mobilize men and resources on site--in large part
because of overstretched capacity and ongoing internal reorganization (para.
2.25). Work began on site in May 1980 (almost a year after contract award)
but progress was desultory; in June 1981 less than 10% of the work had been
completed, due to the absence of resources (workers, equipment, materials).
In October 1981 it was noted that little progress had been made since June.
Annex 2 gives the aide-memoire left with the Government on that occasion.

It was felt that considerable time would be needed to complete the
buildings. The project was therefore closed on the scheduled date, by joint
agreement of the Algerian Government and the Bank, following the first joint
review of Bank projects in Algeria.
1.04     Other elements of the project were implemented successfully:  by
the Closing Date the majority of the staff was Algerian, trained overseas
under the fellowship program (para. 2.30); and about US$2.0 million had been
disbursed for equipment to completely update the laboratories of the
existing school at Boumerdas.
1.05     In addition to this major item, the agreed project included
financing for five separate preinvestment studies relative to future
projects in various ministries (Heavy Industry, Labor, and Higher Education)
and technical assistance aimed at assisting the MOE to achieve its objective
of reforming the formal system of technical education by training planners,
administrators and other education specialists. This reform is now well
advanced, and is founded on a planned rapid growth of upper secondary
technical education. This is to be offered through an expanded network of
"technicums" (secondary schools with technical and prevocational curricula)
which are intended to progressively replace the lower secondary "colleges
d'enseignement technique" and uvDer cycle "lycees techniques" now in
operation. The Third Educ:tion Project is aiding in the establishment of
this network.
Project Items
1.06     The project consisted of the following:
Part A:
(a)  Construction, furnishing and equipment for a new Institute of
Electricity and Electronics at Tlemcen with an approximate gross
area
of 30,000 sq.m. for academic and communal facilities, 33,000 sq.m.
for boarding facilities and 1,000 sq.m. for covered areas;
(b) Twenty-six man-years of technical assistance to the institute for
specialists to serve as heads of various departments during the
first two years of operation, plus approximately 50 man-years of
fellowships for training Algerian faculty abroad (U.S.A. and U.K.).
Part B: Eighteen man-years of consultant services together with 42
man-years of fellowships to assist the MOE in carrying out its work
program covering the study, experimentation and implementation of
primary and secondary education reform.
Part C:
(a) Thirty man-months of technical assistance to the MOL to facilitate
a preinvestment study on the development of vocational training
centers (VTCs) and the need for instructors. This led to the
inclusion of two VTCs under the Third Education Project (Loan
1378-AL), one of which is under construction and the other being
contracted;



ALGERIA II--PCR                      - 3 -
(b) Fourteen man-months of technical assistance to the MOL to
facilitate a study on the development of an instructor training
institute to meet the needs of the VTCs. This led to the financing
of such an institute at Annaba under the fourth education project
(Loan 1595-AL). This institute is now under construction after
successful ICB.
Part D.
(a) Thirty-four man-months of specialist services to the MOHE to
facilitate a study on the use of automatic data processing of
management information systems in higher education. This led to
the inclusion of a data processing system which is now being
procured under the fifth education project (Loan 1803-AL);
(b)  Thirty-six man-months of technical assistance to the MOHE to
facilitate a study on the introduction of modern teaching
technologies in higher education.  The study was completed in April
1978, but its findings were rejected by the MORE as being
unsuitable for adoption in the Algerian context.
Part E:
Eighty-four man-months of technical assistance to the MOHI, to
facilitate a study of the national need for engineers and higher
technicians. This led to the inclusion of the National Institute
for Mechanical Engineering (INGM) under the Fourth Education
Project (Loan 1595-AL).

II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Overview
2.01     The project did not provide the number of training places foreseen
for INELEC and disbursements fell far short of the loan total, since only
US99.76 million out of US$47.0 million had been drawn down by the Government
by the Closing Date. Nevertheless, judged against the original qualitative
objectives, the project did meet with a measure of success. For example,
INELEC is functioning as a highly respected institution, all studies were
satisfactorily completed and most led to components in subsequent projects.
All the technical assistance allocation for INELEC was taken up and has
produced positive results. Only in the case of the MOE was the technical
assistance program incomplete, although that Ministry's fellowship allocation
was taken up. The non-completion of the civil works at Tlemcen was the most
serious shortcoming in project implementation, only 8% of the work having been
finished by the Closing Date and only US$4.46 million disbursed against a
total of USt20.61 million available. At present, no firm schedule for
completion of this infrastructure can be established pending the
recommendation/decision of the ad hoc government committee (Ministries of
Heavy Industry, Planning, Finance), appointed to explore solutions to this
major problem. The reasons behind this situation are dealt with below.
Covenants and Borrower Performance
2.02     All covenants were satisfactorily met by the Borrower, although the
performance of individual ministries varied widely so far as the submission of
the required annual proposals for technical assistance was concerned. Of the
three ministries involved, the NOHI performed best in this regard, and INELEC
was tireless in its efforts to resolve the construction problems at Tlemcen.
Quarterly reports were submitted promptly, and Bank missions received every
cooperation.
Civil Works
Historical Review
2.03     Under a contract signed in 1976, the Educational Development Center
(EDC) of Watertown, Massachusetts, which included the participation of several
American universities, developed in close cooperation with the National
Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (INELEC) of Algeria, the
educational and physical requirements of the project, including an Architect's
brief This preparatory document--addressing the problem of creating a higher
technical, English-language school-has remained the blueprint for the
continuing development of the school.
2.04     Among 13 foreign architectural firms interested in the project, six
were preselected. A Boston-based architectural firm was selected by the
Borrower, approved by the Bank, and on September 23, 1976, a contract was
signed commissioning them to carry out architectural designs. The contract
included the design of staff and faculty housing-which would not be
Bank-financed. This design was in two phases: the first for the academic



ALGERIA II--PCR                        - 6 -
facilities and the first "tranche" of student and staff housing; the second
for the library, the amphitheaters and the second "tranche" of student and
staff housing. The contract for the preparation of bid documents stipulated
the firm's responsibility for prior approval of the shop drawings which would
be prepared by the contractor, as well as responsibility for the supervision
of site works. The shop drawings indicated the site organization and methods
of excavation and types of shuttering to be employed. Thus, they constituted
an integral part of the contractor's work program.
2.05     The Bank received and approved the preliminary plans for Phase I in
January 1977. Delay in payment of the architects' fees caused a six-month
slippage in the schedule of preparation for the construction documents.   This
was compounded by the October 1977 decision in to reduce the site area of the
new institute from 100 hectares to 34 hectares. However, the site location in
the industrial suburb of Tlemcen, close to an electronic assembly plant,
proved eminently suitable. 1/
2.06     The architects completed the master plans in November 1977. A local
contractor was chosen for the preliminary sitework while the bid documents for
Phase I were under preparation. In collaboration with different engineering
firms, the architects completed the bid documents for Phase I in May 1978.
Construction for Phase I was provisionally scheduled to start in September
1978 (instead of March 1977 as envisaged at appraisal).
2.07     INELEC started prequalifidltion procedures (open to international as
well as local contracting firms) in early 1978 and the Bank reviewed and
agreed on the prequalification of 12 contractors for civil works, of which one
was an Algerian state-owned firm.
2.08     During Seotember 1978, site earthworks were completed satisfactorily
and all preselected contractors submitted their bids.
2.09     Initially, the lowest bidder was an Italian firm.  The Algerian firm
then reduced its price, becoming the lowest bidder. At the same time, a
suggestion was made to the local firm by the consultant architectural firm
that they establish an association with an experienced foreign firm with
special reference to management aspects. The civil works contract for Phase I
was finally awarded to the Algerian firm for US$57.8 million in February 1979
and construction was scheduled to begin on that date.
2.10     Because of problems in developing shop drawings on the basis of the
architects' documents, the contractor postponed the start-up of construction
until September 1979. Efforts to improve the technical and operational
management of the project through an agreement between the contractor and a
French firm on a joint venture for this contract were unsuccessful. Finally,
another Algerian firm, identified as a possible source of technical expertise,
proved unable to assist the contractor in developing shop drawings because of
previous commitments.
1/ INELEC remarked in their comments that there had never been any question
of reducing the area of the original INELEC site to 34 hectares and that
the area has therefore remained unchanged.



ALGERIA II--PCRl                      - 7 -
2.11     In June 1979, INELEC received bids for Phase II of the civil works.
The contractor for Phase I and three foreign firms competed for this contract,
but unit prices were considerably higher than those for Phase I (ranging from
two to three times the price per sq. m.). It seems likely that foreign
contractors inflated their prices to cope with obligatory use of local
subcontractors and materials, and bureaucratic and logistical problems.
Finally, the foreign firms dropped their bids and the MOHI rejected the local
contractor's bid as too high (almost double the price of Phase I).
Negotiations between the MOHI and the two prospective contractors for Phase II
were still under way in January 1981, and no award was envisaged by that date.
2.12     Prolonged disputes between the contractor and the architects
continued during 1979 and 1980 over Phase I, on such topics as the use of
local cement (instead of imported, anti-corrosion cement), the use of sea
sand, graduation of aggregate, cleaning of gravel, plumbing, etc. The limited
number of drawings which the contractor developed had to be sent to Boston for
approval before the contractor could submit them to the "Office de Contrtle
Technique de Construction" (CTC) for a building permit.
2.13     On May 1, 1980, excavation started on the foundations of three
buildings in Phase I--38 months behind the start-up date for civil works
scheduled at the time of appraisal. A June 1980 supervision mission estimated
completion of Phase I by March 1983 and completion of Phase II by March 1984,
this last date being based on the assumption that a contract would be signed
with the consultants in September 1980. Work stopped, awaiting CTC approval
of the foundation designs, which was obtained in November 1980.
2.14     In February 1981 it was reported that all site work had stopped
because the contractor had mobilized its equipment and staff to assist in the
reconstruction of the earthquake- stricken town of Ech Cheliff (El-Asnam).
2.15     In June 1981, some of the contractor's equipment had been returned to
the site, but little progress was being made, and the workforce was
insufficient and of poor quality. After failing twice, through ICB, to obtain
bids for Phase II, the MOHI decided to negotiate the award of the Phase II
contract with the Phase I contractor.
2.16     In October 1981 it was noted that the contractor had been unable to:
(a) mobilize effectively (only 40 workers--poorly trained--out of a possible
600 were on site, and there was a shortage of materials and appropriate
equipment); (b) ensure an adequate cash flow to the operation to improve the
standard of work (poor quality of concrete was noted); and (c) adhere to the
revised implementation schedule agreed upon in June 1981. It was not possible
to draw up any reasonable schedule for completion of the buildings. Between
June 1981 and October 1981, no progress was made.
2.17     Consequently, at the November 1981 joint review of Bank-financed
projects, the Algerian Government and the Bank together decided to maintain
the Project Closing Date of December 31, 1981.



ALGERIA II--PCR                       - 8 -
Current Situation
2.18     The completion mission visited the site at Tlemcen on April 7, 1982.
Following a site tour and discussions with the resident chief engineer, the
regional deputy director of the contractor and the resident representative of
INELEC on the site, the mission summarized the situation regarding the civil
works as follows;
(a) less than 8% of the work had been completed at that date--negligible
progress since June 1981; the completed work represented mainly the
foundations of three service buildings, a reinforced concrete
skeleton up to the second floor for two boarding units, and the
columns of a third up to the first floor level. The quality of
concrete was bad because salt-contaminated sand had been used and the
grading of aggregate was inadequate;
(b) the contractor had received from INELEC the sum of DA 45.0 million,
of which only DA 4.5 million was for works claims, the remainder
being for site installation and mobilization;
gc) there was a shortage of equipment (especially cranes) on site. There
were also few workmen --only about 140 instead of the agreed 500 to
600. Consequently, monthly production was estimated at between
DA 0.6 million to DA 1.0 million, instead of DA 8.0 million; and
Cd) the initial contract (for Phase I) of DA 214 million had been
increased to DA 364 million. 1/
2.19     The architectural firm's resident architect left Algeria in February
1982 when his contract expired.  In future, INELEC intends calling on the firm
for short-term consultancies. The contractor is now employing an Algerian
firm to produce the necessary shop drawings and is envisaging the use of four
subcontractors to help speed up the execution of works--a solution which could
aggravate site management problems.
2.20     The contract for Phase II is still under negotiation and the idea of
a fixture joint venture between a local and a foreign contractor has not been
completely abandoned.
2.21     The joint review committee is charged with examining the problems
encountered so far and following-up on the implementation of the project.
2.22     Given the above uncertainties, a firm time schedule remains difficult
to determine. No completion dates have been suggested by any of the
authorities involved.
1/ INELEC remarked in their comments on item (d) that the original contract
has not been changed and that the figure of DA 364 million was the amount
of the re-estimation of the individual plan items.



ALGERIA II--PC-                       - 9- 
Performance of the Consultant Architects
2.23     The architectural firm converted the architect's brief into a
functional and successful master plan, developed the drawings and bid
documents in a timely manner and collaborated constructively with the Director
General of the Institute. He expressed his full satisfaction with their
performance in the design and supervision of the project.
2.24     The problems arose mainly between the architects and the contractor
and, on some of these, more constructive action by the architects might have
led to improved relations. Such measures might have included:
(a) an understanding of the lack of experience of the contractor in
working with U.S. architects and in applying certain international
specifications;
(b)  flexibilitY toward the substitution of certain local materials for
imported ones, providing quality did not suffer (e.g. cement,
sanitary and electrical fittings, etc.); and
(c) in view of the contractor's inability to contract locally for the
shop drawings, the architects might have attempted to assist them in
obtaining the services of a qualified firm.
Performance of the Contracting Firm
2.25     The civil works contract was awarded to the contractor not only
because they were the lowest bidders, but also because they had a good record
of implementing projects in Algeria and were consequently prequalified. The
problems which hampered their efforts to implement the INELEC project can be
summarized as follows
(a) they were undergoing a far-reaching reorganization along regional
lines. Limited resources and cash-flow problems were compounded by
the firm being awarded a large housing project in Tlexcen; the scarce
equipment and skilled labor at Tlemcen had as a result to be shared
between the two sites. It was also apparent that the firm was unable
to attract a skilled workers-in part due to other competing projects
at Tlemcen but also due to overall conditions of employment.  Many of
its ,workers" were in fact displaced agricultural laborers.
MObilization of all contracting firms to participate in the
reconstruction of the earthquake-striken town of Ech Cheliff (El
Asnam) forced the contractor to close down its site activities and
remove its staff and equipment for almost a year;
(b) they did not have sufficient experience with U.S. architectural firms
or in using certain imported materials. Strained relations between
the contractor and the architect over the quality of materials,
workmanship and specifications were further exacerbated by the
tedious procedure of having to send shop drawings to Boston for
approval by project engineers before submitting them to CTC for the
required permits. The drawings and calculation notes sometimes took
more than six weeks to arrive; and



ALGERIA II-PCR                        - 10 -
(c)  they were incapable of marshalling the necessary resources to
generate the shop drawings required to start work on the basis of the
working drawings presented by the architects and engineers and were
also unable to commission other firms (such as local or locally based
French or Romanian firms), or to establish a joint venture with a
foreign contractor.
Bank Supervision
2.26     Between July 1976 and October 1981, the Bank sent 15 missions to
Algeria. The average interval betweeen missions was about 4-1/2 months. The
missions were composed of general educators, technical educators, architects
and economists and totalled 90 man-days. The situation and trends were
described in the mission report and suggestions and recommendations were
raised at the highest level, notably with the Ministry of Finance. The
missions monitored the procurement process for equipment, the studies which
were completed as planned, and the choice of effective technical assistance
for INELEC.
Equipment Procurement
2.27     The urgent need to establish INELEC as quickly as possible, in view
of the national shortage of electronics engineers and technicians, led to the
decision to commence operations in temporary premises at Boumerd&s in March
1976. Equipment procurement therefore proceeded earlier than would otherwise
have been the case if the opening had been phased to coincide with the
completion of the Tlemcen campus. From a total of US$14,660,000 allocated for
equipment procurement, US$1,957,000 was disbursed at the Closing Date, which,
although only 13.5% of available funds, has fully equipped the few available
laboratories and workshops at BoumerdAs. The remaining 86.5% of the funds
were to have replicated the Boumerd4s equipment in line with the larger
student enrollment planned at Tlemcen. The mission was favorably impressed
with the way in which this equipment (most of it of a highly sophisticated
nature in line with both current electronics technology and the level of
programs being conducted) had been installed and was being maintained.
Technical Assistance (TA)
2.28     Of the US$3.54 million originally allocated to TA, US$1.79 million
remained undisbursed at the Closing Date. The main objective of the INELEC TA
program was to allow for: (a) the recruitment of specialists to produce
curricula, install equipment and start up courses; and (b) to train selected
Algerian graduates overseas in preparation for their becoming members of the
faculty. The care taken by the INELEC management to recruit high caliber
expatriates showed results as, almost without exception, they performed
excellently and devoted much time to the training of their Algerian
counterparts. Table 2 below illustrates the success achieved.

2.29     TA allocated to the MOE was for assisting the reform of primary and
secondary education. During the latter part of the project, however,
important and wide-ranging decisions were taken by the Government which
affected this reform, e.g., the creation of a new Secretariat of State for
Secondary and Technical Education which removed responsibility for this
activity from the MOE, leaving the latter solely responsible for the planning
and implementation of a new nine-year basic education program, incorporating
prevocational elements. As a result, only the fellowship component of this TA
was taken up by the MOE, and 30 fellows attended programs aimed at improving
their teaching and educational management capabilities in various universities
and institutions in France and Belgium. The duration of these fellowships
ranged from three to nine months. Although the Government was requested to
provide information about their present activities and past assignments, such
information has not been conveyed to the Bank to date.
Educational Objectives
2.30     The qualitative objectives established for INELEC have been achieved
in large measure. An evaluation carried out in 1981 jointly by two U.S.
institutes of technology awarded a top university rating to INELEC, comparing
it favorably with institutions in the U.S.A. . It is a fact, however, that
the annual output capable of being graduated from the temporary facility at
Boumerdas (40 engineers and 90 higher technicians) falls far short of the
national requirement and the project objective. Once the new campus at
Tlemcen has been completed, the highly successful programs at Boumerdas can be
transferred and offered to a larger number of students. Given the strong
technical leadership available at Boumerdas, plus the solid and relevant
programs introduced, the Bank may wish to consider further assisting the
Institute by financing the procurement of the remaining equipment when the
Tlemcen campus is ready to receive it. Currently, the number of qualified
applicants for courses at Boumerdas exceeds the number of places available by
9:1 for engineers and 18:1 for higher technicians.
2.31     A tracer system, required under the terms of the Loan Agreement
(Section 3.04(a)) has been established by INELEC and has collected data
relating to the 1981/82 graduating classes of engineers and higher technicians

III. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
Costs
Construction
3.01    The project costs as estimated at appraisal cannot be readily compared
to the costs of the project as estimated at the time of the completion mission
(April 1982), because implementation of civil works at that time did not
exceed 8% of the total project works. The total project cost at appraisal was
estimated at US$78.0 million of which US$47.0 million was in foreign
currency. The cost estimated by the completion mission stands at US$106.0
million with a foreign component of US$63.5 million. This estimated cost
overrun of about 35% over the appraisal estimate is based on a completion date
of June 1985, three and a half years behind that estimated at appraisal.
Because of prolonged delays in implementation and the uncertainty of
completion dates, the Algerian Government and the Bank decided to: (a)
maintain the initial Closing Date of December 31, 1981; and (b) maintain
financing of the technical assistance out of the balance of US$0.3 million
through March 31, 1982, at which date the undisbursed balance of US$0.144
million was cancelled. The total amount cancelled at July 13, 1982 was
thus US$37.24 million.
3.02    Currently, only Phase I of the civil works contract has been signed at
a cost of US$98.3 million or 70% higher than the contract of 1979 for Phase I
US$57.8 million.  The contract for Phase II is still under negotiation and the
Government currently has no implementation schedules or completion target date.
Equipment
3.03    Equipment cost was appraised at US$14.7 million (including price
contingency). Only US$1.957 million was disbursed by the Closing Date or
13.4% of the initial funds. The procured amounts were used to equip INELEC's
provisional installation at Boumerd?s while the balance was not procured
awaiting completion of civil works at Tlemcen.
3.04    Project costs by type of expenditure as estimated at appraisal and at
completion are as follows:

Disbursements
3.05    Estimated and actual disbursements are shown graphically in Chart 1.
Disbursements lagged far behind appraisal estimates as a result of analogous
delays in implementation. A comparison of actual withdrawals with appraisal
estimates is shown by semester in Annex 1. The following table shows total
disbursements by type of expenditure:

Algeria (Loan 1209-AL), dated February 3, 1984
Dear Sir:
I thank you for the above-mentioned report and have the following
comments to offer:
Page vii
The Inter-Ministerial Commission referred to was composed of the
ministries of Heavy Industry, Planning and Housing.
Paragraph iii, page viii
100 places, not 150, are offered annually by competitive examination.
Paragraph 2.05
There has never been any question of reducing the area of the
original INELEC site to 34 hectares. The area has therefore remained
unchanged.
Page 8. paragraph (d)
The original contract with DNC has not been changed. As for the
figure of DA 364 million, this is the amount of the re-estimation of the
individual plan items.
Very truly yours,
/s/ A. BENAZZOUZ
Director General
INELEC
