TEACHER TRAINING PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:           People's Republic of China
Beneficiary:        State Education Commission,
Provincial/Municipal/Prefectural Governments
Amount:              SDR 36.8 million (US$50.0 million equivalent)
Terms:               Standard, with 35 year maturity
Project Objectives
and Description:  The project objective is to expand and upgrade inservice
training of lower secondary school teachers to assist the
Government in its efforts to achieve universal basic
education. The project emphasizes improvement in the
quality of teachers and institution building. The project
would have three components. The first component would
assist 16 provincial and 53 prefectural institutes of
education (IOEs) to expand and improve their capability to
meet the urgent demand for qualified lower secondary
teachers. The second component would assist three munici-
pal IOEs to evolve into: (a) information clearinghouses
on teacher training curriculum, methodology and materials;
and (b) research and evaluation and monitoring cernters on
key issues in teacher training. The third component would
improve management capability of the teacher training
system. The proposed project would provide construction,
equipment, books and teaching materials, and related
technical assistance. The Government plans to take the
following actions in parallel with the proposed project to
improve the teacher training system: (a) to increase
intake of students from disadvantaged provinces; (b) to
increase IOE average weekly teaching hours by 50%; (c) to
experiment with training teachers to teach two subjects;
(d) to increase female participation in inservice lower
secondary teacher training; (e) to increase funds to equip
lower secondary science laboratories adequately; and (f)
to increase annual intake of lower secondary teacher
trainees to at least 70Z of the total intake at provincial
IOEs.
Benefits and        The principal benefits of the proposed project would be:
Risks:             (a) expanded and improved lower secondary teac  - training
institutions, and cost-effectiveness of inserv te tea-her
training programs; (b) demonstration effects for non-
project institutions nationwide; and (c) enhanced capa-
bility in planning, curriculum development, management,

research and evaluation to strengthen the teacher training
system. The major risk of the project would lie in the
inexperience of, and variation in ability of provincial
and prefectural authorities in the implementation of an
IDA-financed project. This risk will be reduced consider-
ably by the participation of the State Elucation Comr-
mission (SEdC), which is experienced in the implementation
of four Bank Group-financed education projects.

CHINA
TEACHER TRAINING PROJECT
I. BASIC EDUCATION AND TEACHER TRAINING IN CHINA
A. Overview of the Basic Education
1.1       In May 1985 the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
announced its "Decision on Reform of the Education Structure," which marked
the most significant reform in Chinese education since 1949. The reform
called for universalizing nine years of basic education, expanding vocational
and technical e4ucation at secondary and post secondary levels, increasing the
enrollment and autonomy of higher education institutions, and strengthening
education management at all levels.
1.2       On the basis of the "Decision on Reform of the Education Structure,"
the Government passed the "Compulsory Education Law" in 1986, under which
nine-year Universal Basic Education (UBE) was to be achieved in stages:
(a) in the cities and coastal areas by 1990;
(b) in towns and villages with a medium level of development by 1995;
and
(c) in the more remote areas, at a rate commensurate with the economic
development of each area. (See Annex 1).
1.3       Achieving universal schooling at the primary level will not be
difficult because the net enrollment ratio in primary schooling is already
96%. Furthermore, as a result of an effective population control program, the
primary school age group is expected to decrease, with the result that the
required numbers of primary school teachers will decrease from 5.4 million at
present to 5.0 million in 1990 and remain relatively stable thereafter. The
future output from primary school teacher training institutions will therefore
be employed to replace the 2.1 million primary school teachers who do not have
the required education credentials (39Z of the present primary school teaching
force).
1.4       Universal schooling at the lower secondary level (grades 7 through
9), however, can be achieved only with great difficulty; at present, the gross
enrollment ratio is 52%, a respectable figure for a developing country but far
short of the goal. If universal schooling is to be achieved at the lower
secondary level by the year 2000, enrollment will have to increase by a
staggering 22 million students. This would impose a heavy burden upon the
lower secondary school building program and the corresponding budgets of the
provinces which are financially responsible for primary and secondary levels
of education. All are committed to achieving this national goal, and all but
the poorest provinces are likely to succeed by the year 2000.



1.5       Far more difficult than constructing the needed additional
classrooms and purchasing equipment will be the task of providing sufficient
numbers of qualified teachers at lower secondary level. To achieve universal
education, the number of lower secondary school teachers would have to
increase from 2.2 million in 1985 to 3.1 million in the year 2000. If a fully
qualified teaching force is to be achieved, the teacher training system, in
addition to providing the above numbers of new teachers, will have to train
the massive numbers of unqualified lower secondary school teachers (not
possessing the required academic qualification of 2-3 years of post-secondary
education); they constitute an overwhelming 73Z of the lower secondary school
teaching force. The most urgent task is to train the 1.6 million unqualified
lower Lecondary teachers. Of this pool of "unqualified" teachers, there are
about 0.3 million teachers without the appropriate edu_-tion credentials but
with more than 20 years of teaching experience; they are not considered to
require further training. In addition, another 0.3 million teachers are
considered "untrainable" due to lack of skill or motivation and will be
gradually reduced through attrition. Thus, the task is to provide necessary
training to roughly one million existing unqualified teachers.
B. The Lower Secondery School Teacher Training System -
1.6       Junior Normal Colleges (JNCs).  Preservice training of lQr4er
secondary school teachers consists of two- or three-year programs _  in a
Junior Normal College (JNC). All students have completed upper secondary
school and have passed a nationwide examination. The JNCs are 100l residen-
tial and are regarded as the primary source of the new teachers that will be
required by the proposed expansion of the lower secondary school system.
Accordingly, JNCs increased by 801 between 1980 and 1985 reaching 183 in
number. There is no plan for an overall increase of JNCs in the next ten
years since the recently expanded facilities will be adequate to meet the
planned enrollment expansion.
1.7       Provincial and Prefectural Institutes of Education (IOEs).
Inservice teacher training for upper and lower secondary teachers is provided
at 29 provincial/municipal IOEs and 233 prefectural IOEs, respectively.
However, increasingly provincial IOEs are asked to train unqualified lower
secondary teachers due to the urgency to meet the mandate for UBE. The intake
for IOEs consists mainly of "unqualified teachers" who do not have the
required education credentials. In addition to a two-year full-time residen-
tial training, the IOEs also provide three-year on-the-job training through
commuting and correspondence programs. Provincial IOEs are financially
supported by the Provincial Bureau of Education (PBOE) whereas Prefectural
IOEs are supported by their respective prefectural governments. Many provin-
1/   See Annexes 2 and 3 for structure of the ove.:all teacher training systems
and 1986 statistics on teacher training institution, respectively.
2/   Until 1986, JNCs provided a three-year program.  This was reduced to a
two-year program to increase output. During the current transitional
period two types of programs coexist.



- 3 -
cial and prefectural IOEs have only 40-50X of the laboratory equipment
required to carry out the standard list of science experiments prescribed by
the SEdC.
1.8       The IOE enrollment has increased sixfold since 1981.  This is partly
due to increased enrollment in part-time commuter and correspondence programs,
which are not constrained by lack of student dormitories. Since 1985, the
provincial and prefectural governments have built 45 new IOEs and 5 more are
exp,ected by 1988. In order to train the 1 million trainable teachers
(para. 1.5), the Government plans to expand the current annual output of IOEs
from about 70,000 to 80,000 by 1990. The total student output between 1986
and 1992 is estimated at 470,000. In addition, the JNCs are also requested by
SEdC to begin inservice programs (mainly correspondence) to produce an annual
output of 10,000 students for a total of 50,000 by 1992. The Government
therefore expects that 50% of the current stock of "unqualified trainable
teachers" will obtain the appropriate education credentials by 1992 through
expansion of existing institutions.
1.9       Municipal Institutes of Education.  In economically advanced areas
such as the three major municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai), where
nearly all the primary and lower secondary teachers needing upgrading will
receive training within a decade, the role of an IOE is changing to that of a
resource center for professional supportp including information dissemination,
research and evaluation, and management training. This includes refresher
courses and preparation of innovative teaching materials and reference
materials. The refresher programs at the Beijing and Shanghai IOEs are short,
3-4 week workshops on special topics. The Shanghai IOE is planning to provide
every qualified teacher with 160-240 contact hours of inservice training
within the next five years. Courses will focus on practical training in areas
new to teachers such as computer literacy and use of science laboratory
equipment.
1.10      The Beijing IOE already serves a major role as a reference center
for new and experimental teaching materials, and as a center for the evalua-
tion of such materials and teaching methods, and the dissemination of their
findings. The Tianjin IOE has developed microcomputer-based management
systems for accounting, student registration, and library book inventory. The
Institute is training school administrators to use such systems to improve the
efficiency of school management. All the municipal IOEs recently began to
reserve places specifically for unqualified lower secondary teachers from
disadvantaged provinces and minorities regions. These trainees are provided
with full financial support by the sponsoring municipal IOEs.
1.11      Cost-Effectiveness of Alternative tnservice Training Systems.  China
uses taree methods of inservice training:
(a)  a two-year residential pro3ram where the teachers take a paid leave
of absence from their jobs;
(b) a three-year commuter program where teachers commute to the IOE
campus three days a week and spend the remaining three days teaching
in their respective schools; and



- 4 -
(c)  a three-year correspondence program in which the trainees receive 30
days of classroom instruction per year at either an outreach station
from a visiting IOE faculty membur, or on an IOE campus during
summer and winter vacations.  While on campus, the trainees perform
laboratory experiments required by the curriculum for about 15 days,
6 hours per day.
1.12      In the commuter and the correspondence programs, the cost of
providing residential accommodation is eliminated and the teachers remain on
their jobs in the classrooms where they are able to apply the benefits of
training directly to their current teaching. The commuter program, however,
can only be offered in cities and town centers where public transportation is
easily available.
1.13      Increasingly correspondence programs incorporate education
television (ETV) courses. Since the introduction of satellite education in
1986, a total of about 1,000 receiving stations have been set up in China.
About 400 of these stations also have equipment to re-transmi.  the program to
rural areas. Since August 1987, the ETV stations began broadcasting inservice
programs for lower secondary teachers in seven specialties (Chinese, History,
Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Physical Education). Many IOEs
are planning to incorporate ETV into their correspondence programs.
1.14      Comparison of pass rates between students in a full-time residential
program versus those in a correspondence-only program indicate that the full-
time program is more pedagogically effective. It results in virtually no
dropouts and provides high quality training as judged by scores on national
examinations. The low dropout rate and good examination results may, however,
simply reflect the higher quality of students admitted into this type of
program. The correspondence program, when supplemented by ETV and classroom
instruction, is significantly more cost-effective. Currently, its recurrent
cost per student is less than 1OZ of that of the residential programs. Even
with higher dropout rates of about 10Z-15Z, the correspondence/ETV program is
much more cost-efficient and a more effective means of training large numbers
of unqualified teachers by the year 2000. Currently, about 25X of the
trainees are in the residential program, 8Z are in the commuter program and
67Z in the correspondence program (See Table 2.1).
C. Issues in the Teacher Training System
1.15      Shortage of Teachers.  There is a quantitative as well as
qualitative gap in teacher supply at the lower secondary level. Projections
of teacher supply and demand based on national data suggest that the upgrading
of unqualified teachers can be completed within a decade with the existing
capacity, or even earlier with expansion of inservice teacher training insti-
tutions. However, further calculations based on detailed provincial data
reveal that the national data obscure the huge dispari.y between advanced and
disadvantaged provinces. While advanced provinces would ciuse the gap in
qualified teacher supply within five or six years, the most disadvantaged
provinces would continue to have a gap well beyond the year 2010. There are
17 provinces in the latter category requiring 5,000 to 152,000 qualified



- 5 -
teachers in 1995 (Annex 4). In some provinces as many as 88Z of teachers
currently in post are unqualified, and the percentage is not likely to
decrease as new unqualified teachers are added to the teaching force to meet
the rising enrollment due to UBE. A ranking of the provinces in terms of
greatest need for qualified teachers is shown in Annex 4. Bank projections
indicate that for about half of the country, the mandate for UBE with quali-
fied teachers cannot be met unless drastic measures are taken to improve the
existing capacity of inservice teacher training institutions. Under the
present five-year plan, the Government plans to train 50X of the unqualified
lower secondary teachers by 1992.
1.16      Inequality among Provinces.  The three advanced municipalities have
already established a four-year undergraduate-level degree as the appropriate
standard for secondary teachers (including lower secondary teachers) and have
begun to train teachers to meet the new higher standards. However, the
disadvantaged provinces are having difficulties to produce enough qualified
teachers even at the two-year JNC level. The gap is expected to widen as
financial and management responsibilities for education become increasingly
decentralized. It is difficult to transfer educational resources from the
advanced provinces to allow poorer provinces to catch up, or to transfer
substantial numbers of surplus qualified teachers to poor provinces. Even
within a province, disparities exist between urban and rural areas. However,
on an experimental basis, the Government is setting aside 50-100 student
positions in each well-off municipal and provincial IOE for students from
poorer areas. Due to the rigid job a2signment system for teachers in China,
all trainees return to their place of origin without exception.
1.17      Underutilization of Teachers.  Faculty of IOEs teach between 4 to 8
hours per week. This is far below the international norm of 8 to 18 hours per
week, and is due in part to the fact that some IOEs and departments within
them have '-i-fficient enrollments to utilize fully the specific faculty
members.      hers also lack facilities.
1.18      Teacher Training Curriculum.  All teachers are currently trained in
one speciality and about 80X of the curriculum is devoted to training in that
specialty. In addition to the problem of low teaching loads, the small size
of many lower secondary schools makes it virtually impossible to provide
single-subject specialist teachers with a full timetable. Some rural schools
teach only six classes and are not large enough to employ one teacher for each
subject in the curriculum. As a result, these schools are forced to offer a
reduced curriculum. Even in larger schools, the subject specialists in areas
other than basic courses such as Chinese language and Mathematics cannot teach
a full load as hours allocated to other subjects are relatively fewer. There
is, therefore, growing pressure on many IOEs by rural schools to train
teachers who can teach two subjects. Some IOEs have already begun training
teachers in specialties which share some common courses such as History and
Politics where one speciality is designated as a "major" and the other a
"ominor" subject. Without violating the existing SEdC curriculum guidelines
regarding the number of hours allocated to major subjects, those IOEs have
sought to increase coursework in the minor subjects.



1.19      Under-utilization of Space and Facilities.  State Education
Commission (SEdC) gui2delines for academic and non-academic buildings are based
on a standard area (m ) per student. This has resulted in wide spread over-
building and under-utilization of laboratories. Furthermore, the common
practice is to give group lectures in the morning and to conduct experiments
in the afternoons only. Thus laboratories are empty for at least half of the
day and are rarely used for more than 4 hours per day. Another common
practice is to allocate one laboratory to each major topic in each science
speciality with specialized equipment affixed to benches in the specialized
rooms.
1.20      Low Female Participation.  The share of female trainees in different
provincial and prefectural IOEs ranges between 7Z to 47X of total enroll-
ment. Ihe overall average is a low 27Z. This is a result of past low female
enrollment at all levels of education which *esulted in the current low ratio
of female teachers at all levels: 37Z in primary education, 26Z in secondary
education and 26Z in higher education. The burden of housework and child care
is the key reason for the reluctance of prospective females to enroll in
IOEs. This problem is not, however, as severe in urban areas as in rural
areas. The Beijing and Tianjin municipal IOEs, for example, however, enroll
more female than male teachers in their inservice training programs (Annex 5,
page 3). Correspondence programs attract more female students than residen-
tial programs, especially since some correspondence outreach stations have
facilities for child care.
D. Public Expenditure on Education
1.21      From 1980 to 1985, China significantly increased public recurrent
and capital expenditures for education. Recurrent and capital expenditures
increased by 191 and 40X per year, respectively. During the same period, the
share of the total education s7penditures (recurrent and capital) as percent
of the total national budget - also significantly increased from 6.11 to
7.8Z.  Despite such national efforts, financial support for education at all
levels comprises only 3.1Z of GNP, which is still smaller than those in other
developing countries (about 4Z-5Z) and developed countries (61 or much
higher). In 1985, about 801 of current and 40Z of capital expenditures in
education were allocated to primary and secondary education. It is estimated
that about 5Z of total recurrent expenditures was allocated to teacher train-
ing in 1985.   Per capita recurrent expenditures in basic education and
teacher training averaged about Y 100 (Y 50 for primary education and Y 150
for secondary education) and Y 1,100 (Y 1,400 for preservice teacher training
and Y 800 for inservice teacher training), respectively, in 1985. Full-time
preservice and inservice teacher trainees are provided with free tuition,
boarding and subsidies for food. Direct subsidies for teacher trainees in
preservice and inservice teacher training institutes average only 1Z of the
recurrent budget allocated to teacher training.
3/   The national budget includes expenditures by the Central, Provincial,
Municipal and Prefectural Governments.



- 7 -
1.22      Recognizing that development of the teacher training system is an
urgent priority, the Government has earmarked a Y 1.3 billion special supple-
mentary fund for teacher training under the 1985-90 Five-Year Plan. Of this
amount, Y 0.3 billion are for new civil works, and Y 0.2 billion per year for
improvement of facilities including equipment, furniture, and instructional
materials. In the past two years, most of this supplementary fund has been
spent on JNCs. The Government has recently embarked, however, on a massive
renovation and building program for the IOEs. Most of this construction is
scheduled to be completed by mid-1988. China estimates that its GNP will
triple before the end of the century. This anticipated growth--together with
favorable demographic trends and possibilities of improving efficiency--offers
China the opportunity both to meet the financial needa of the planned educa-
tion development and to achieve quality improvements, without a sharp increase
in the share of GNP allocated to general education, teacher training and
higher education.
E. Government Strategy and Objectives
1.23      The National People's Congress has officially recognized teacher
training as a top priority in implementing UBE. Given the necessary time lag
to produce output to meet teacher demand, strengthening the teacher training
system is considered a most urgent task in the 1985-1990 Five-Year Plan.
1.24      The Government has made several major policy changes to achieve its
objectives in meeting the demand for lower secondary teachers:
(a)  allowing Provincial IOEs to train lower as well as upper secondary
teachers;
(b)  encouraging "multiple channels for teacher inservice training,"
including ETV, correspondence programs and contracting with
comprehensive universities and other higher education institutions
for short-term courses;
(c)  increasing output by shortening the duration of the training
programs for lower secondary teachers at the JNCs from three to two
years (para. 1.06); and
(d)  allowing experienced teachers without formal academic credentials to
reach "qualified status" by examination.1-
F. Bank Group Strategy
1.25      To date, the Bank Group has focussed much of its attention in the
education sector on the development of higher education, in accordance with
4/   This examination is held yearly and candidates choose one or two subjects
they wish to sit for.  In 1987, 2,600 sat for the exam and only 412
passed. If a candidate passes two subjects per year, it would still take
five or six years to reach qualified status.



the Government's priorities. In view of pressing needs for professional
manpower, the Bank Group will continue its strategy of further strengthening
higher education through development of postgraduate education in selected
disciplines. In addition, the Bank Group completed sector work in support of
the Government's policy to expand the vocational and technical education
systems to meet growing needs for skilled manpower and providing technical
assistance in management education. The Bank Group is now prepared to assist
the Government in its effort to achieve UBE through financial support and
policy advice directed at the expansion and improvement of inservice training
of lower secondary school teacners and the provision of textbooks and other
learning materials and relevant technical assistance. The Bank Group's
involvemient in basic education began with the education component of the Gansu
provincial development project and a sector report on the production and
distribution of textbooks and preparatior. of a project in this area.
1.26      The "Compulsory Education Law" (Annex 1) gives local governments the
responsibility for achieving UBE, and, as discussed in paragraph 1.7,
provincial and lower level governments are financially responsible for teacher
training. Bank Group assistance in teacher training is therefore directed at
provincial and lower level governments. However, as policies in teacher
training are decided and prescribed at the national level, planned actions
leading to greater cost-efficiency and effective management would be insti-
tuted at the national level through this project. Planned improvements in
teacher productivity and utilization, teacher training curriculum, the
efficient mix of delivery systems, and space and facilities utilization will
be critical to achieving increased cost-efficiency in the teacher training
system.
1.27      Given limited resources, the Bank Group would focus its short-term
and long-term support on:
(a) inservice teacher training to upgrade as quickly as possible the
lower secondary teachers who are unqualified, particularly as the
Government has already devoted a large share of its own resources to
preservice training; and
(b) longer-term institution building, focussing on IOEs to upgrade
permanently the professional support network for teachers.
G. Rationale for Bank Group Involvement
1.28      The proposed project would provide the Bank Group with its first
opportunity to assist the Government to address urgent needs for the national
teacher training system to meet the mandate for the nine-year UBE to be
achieved in stages (para. 1.2). Achieving the UBE is an important aspect of
the overall strategy to strengthen education's contribution to reform a devel-
opment in China. The proposed project would contribute directly to increasing
the capacity and improving the quality of teacher training in each of the
three municipalities and 17 provinces included in the proposed project,
including relatively poor provinces and autonomous regions. To carry its
mandate effectively and efficiently, the Government fully recognizes that the
issues discussed earlier (paras. 1.15-1.20) must be urgently tackled. The



- 9 -
Government also recognizes that management capabilities of the SEdC and local
education authorities need to be strengthened. In parallel with the proposed
project, the Government has decided to undertake the following measures:
(a) raising teaching hours of IOE faculty members;
(b) experimenting new curriculum to train lower secondary teachers to
teach two-subjects;
(c) raising female participation rate in inservice lower secondary
teacher training;
(d) increasing intake of lower secondary trainees at provincial IOEs;
and
(e) equiping lower secondary schools with required basic science equip-
ment, where needed to enhance quality of lower secondary educa-
tion.
These measures would have an impact not only on the teacher training system in
the provinces and municipalities included in the project, but also on the
teacher training system in other provinces through expected demonstration
effects.
H. Experience with Past Lending
1.29      Seven Bank Group-financed projects in China have supported education
under three ministries. Four are under the SEdC. The first project, the
University Development Project (Loan 2021/Credit 1167-CHA, US$200 m), assisted
28 major national universities in the fields oA science and technology. It
was approved in 1981 and has been satisfactorily completed. The Project
Completion Report (PCR) dated September 30, 1987 indicates that the project
met its objectives of increasing enrollments and enhancing the quality of
graduates in science and engineering. It also helped to improve the quality
of university management. Another project was approved in 1983 for the
development of polyteLhnic and television education (Credit 1411-CA,
US$85 m). The Second University Development Project (Credit 1551-CA, US$145 m
approved in 1985) is helping to strengthen education in engineering, economics
and finance in 35 universities. In 1986, the Provincial Universities Project
was approved (Credit 1671-CA, US$120 m). It is assisting provincial universi-
ties and the SEdC to expand enrollments and improve the quality and management
of provincial higher education programs. Special emphasis is being given to
teacher education programs in normal universities (NUs). Under the Ministry
of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, two loans/credits were
extended in 1982 and 1984 for the development of professional agricultural
manpower (Credit 1297-CA, Loan 2444/Credit 1500-CA, total US$144 m). A Rural
Health and Medical Education Project approved in 1984 (Credit 1472-CA, US$85
m) included about US$43 m for support of medical universities under the
Ministry of Public Health. The Gansu Provincial Development Project (Ln.
2812, Cr. 1793-CHA), which was signed in 1987, has an Education Component
(US$20 m) that will assist the province to meet the objectives of the
education reform. It is also the first operation specifically focussing on



- 10 -
basic education. Implementation of the projects is generally very satisfac-
tory. Policy initiatives are being implemented as agreed and other
quantitativ' and qualitative targets in ongoing projects are generally being
achieved as scheduled.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
2.1       The proposed project is designed to expand and upgrade inservice
training of lower secondary school teachers to assist the Government in its
efforts to achieve UBE. The emphasis of the project is on improvement in the
qualification of teachers and on institution building. Specifically, the
objectives of the proposed project are to:
(a) improve the quality of and the output from the inservice training of
lower secondary school teachers;
(b)  improve the management capability of SEdC, provincial and municipal
education administrators in teacher training system;
(c) help alleviate inequality among provinces;
(d) raise female participation in inservice training programs for
unqualified lower secondary teachers; and
(e) increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the lower
secondary school teacher training system.
B. Project Components
2.2       The proposed project would comprise the following components:
(a) construction, instructional equipment, books and teaching,materials,
and related technical assistance (TA) for 16 provincial,- 53
prefectural and 3 municipal IOEs; and
(b) TA to improve the management of the teacher training system.
Provincial and Prefectural Institutes of Education
2.3       The objectives of this component are to:
(a) assist 16 provincial and 53 prefectural IOEs (26Z of the total
number of IOEs in China) to improve and expand their capability in
5/   Seventeen (17) provinces are included in the proposed project (para.
1.28), out of which Jiangsu Province did not request its provincial IOE
to be considered for inclusion in the proposed project.



- 11 -
meeting the urgent demand for qualified lower secondary teachers in
their respective provinces and prefectures; and
(b) serve as a vehicle for significant improvement measures on a
national scale.
It is expected that the project IOEs will demonstrate the merits of these
measures so convincingly that these planned improvements in the teacher
training system will be adopted on a national scale. All project IOEs (Anvex
5) are strategically located in provinces and prefectures with large numbers
of lower secondary schools and large pools of untrained lower secondary school
teachers, including those from disadvantaged/minority areas.
2.4       Table 2.1 summarizes the present enrollments and planned expansions
of the proposed provincial and prefectural IOEs in alternative inservice
training programs for unqualified teachers (see Annex 6 for more details).

From 1987 to 1992, enrollment in the residential program will increase by an
average of 471, whereas the commuter program will increase by 1101 and the
correspondence/ETV program by 501. On average, the project IOEs plan to
expand enrollment by 541 over the project period.
2.5       The proposed project would include the construction of additional
classrooms, laboratories, and libraries and the provision of instructional
books and teaching materials. The project would also provide instructional
equipment to augment the existing items to enable each IOE to perform the
complete range of experiments prescribed by the SEdC in the subjects of
physics, chemistry, biology, geography, languages, psychology, computer
science, and audiovisual methods. Each prefectural IOE would also be provided
with two four-wheel drive vehicles and additional equipment packages to be
used exclusively by traveling outreach teams in classroom instruction centers
(County Teacher Inservice Schools generally). This would permit teacher
trainees upgraded through distance media to benefit from effective classroom
instruction for at least 30 days per year.
2.6       Thirty-six staff-months of specialist services would be provided
under the project to assist in the upgrading of the teaching statf of all
project IOEs (Annex 12). Pedagogial experts in physics, chemistry,
mathematics, biology, geography, education, psychology, instructional media,
low-cost instructional equipment, and computer science would conduct one week
seminars in four strategically located centers during each visit of one
month. The number of visits to China would vary from specialization to
specialization and would range from two visits for a geography specialist to
five visits for the physics and chemistry specialists. With an average class.
size of 30 trainees, approximately 4,320 IOE staff are expected to benefit
from this program. The project would also include a large local training
program of longer duration. In addition, 800 staff members of project IOEs
would receive one year sf training in local NUs in laboratory instructional
methodology and equipment maintenance procedures; another 1700 would receive a
half year of training in subject courses in local NUs. A substantial overseas
training program would be included in the project to provide post-graduate
training and to acquaint the teaching and administrative staff of the IOEs and
PBOEs with the latest developments in teacher training abroad. One staff
member from each provincial and municipal IOE (19) would enroll in a two year
master's degree program; 120 staff members from the project IOEs would study
abroad in a Visiting Scholars program; and 86 teachers and administrators
would participate in month long study tours.
Municipal Institutes of Education
2.7       The objective of this project component is to help improve inservice
teacher training programs for unqualified lower secondary teachers and develop
a permanent network of professional support in teacher training by using the
resources of the IOEs in three advanced municipalities, Beijing, Shanghai and
Tianjin (para. 1.9) to assist other IOEs nationwide.   The three municipal
IOEs will become:
(a) the clearinghouses for gathering, evaluating and disseminating
information on teacher training curriculum, methodology and



- 13 -
materials (textbooks, reference books, didactic aids), and research
and development relating to the above, carried out all over China by
individuals or commissioned agencies; and
(b) research, evaluation and monitoring centers on key issues in teacher
training, especially the proposed measures to improve the teacher
training system (para. 2.13).
2.8       The three municipal IOEs will undertake the following studies on the
proposed improvements of the teacher training system the Government plans to
undertake in parallel with this proposed project (para. 2.13):
(a) a study on the cost-effectiveness of alternative delivery systems
including residential, conmuter and correspondence/ETV programs
analyzing cost factors, pre-post tests of student achievement, mode
of delivery, and appropriate mix of classroom instruction,
correspondence and ETV instruction;
(b) a study on the training of dual subject teachers investigating the
appropriate combination of subjects, and the cost-effectiveness of
dual subject teachers in rural schools; and
(c) a study on methods of increasing female participation in the teacher
training system, particularly in lOEs.
The three studies would be completed by September 1990. During negotiations,
agreement was reached that these studies would be carried out with Terms of
Reference and specific timing for each study agreed between the Government and
the Association, and that the results of the studies would be furnished to the
Association for comment promptly upon completion. The results of these
studies are expected to lead to revisions in the SEdC guidelines. Findings of
the studies will be disseminated through the information network established
under the proposed project component.
2.9       The proposed project would include the same general categories as
included for the other project IOEs--construction of additional classrooms,
laboratories, and library and the provision of instructional equipment, books,
and teaching materials. In addition, however, this project component would
include equipment and TA specifically intended to enable the municipal IOEs to
assist better the entire IOE system (para. 2.7). This equipment would
comprise:
(a) two microcomputers and software for each municipal IOE and for each
of 16 Provincial IOEs that serve as nodes for the information net-
work; and
(b) one microcomputer and software for the offices of each of the
project IOE presidents and PBOE directors.
TA would consist of 24 staff-months of specialist services to be distributed
among the following fields: cimputer data processing, library management,
research and evaluation methodology, facilities planning and utilization, and
institutional management.



- 14 -
2.10      During negotiations, the Government peovided assurance that a
Coordinating Committee would be established in the SEdC by December 31, 1988,
including representatives of the three municipal IOEs, to coordinate the
proposed studies and other research activities and specialist services to
realize the full potential of the municipal IOE programs.
Management of Teacher Training System
2.11      The primary objective of this proposed project component is to
improve the management capability of the teacher training system at the
national, provincial, municipal and prefectural levels. The proposed compo-
nent would include four statf years of specialist services to be distributed
among the fields of:
(a) planning and statistical data processing;
(b) curriculum development, with particular regard to a curriculum to
train dual subject teachers;
(c) management systems;
(d) testing and evaluation; and
(e) facility planning.
In addition, 14 staff-months of overseas study tours would be provided for
SEdC administrators, IOEs administrators and provincial/municipal bureau of
education directors to examine personnel, administration, financial management
and planning procedures. One month seminars in management would be offered to
four members of each project IOE and PBOE to improve their administrative
abilities. To assist in the development of a management information system,
the SEdC would be provided with 3 microcomputers for data processing and
statistical analysis.
2.12      The Government prepared detailed action plans including
implementation timetables for the proposed TA for the provincial, prefectural
and municipal IOEs, and management of teacher training system. These detailed
action plans were discussed during negotiations, and the Government provided
assurances that it would carry out the TA programs as agreed with the
Association (Annex 12).
Project-Supported Improvements of Teacher Training System
2.13      In light of the issues affecting basic education development (paras.
1.15-1.20), the SEdC, provincial, municipal and prefectural authorities
involved in the proposed project plan to undertake the following education
measures to make the national teacher training system at all levels efficient,
cost-effective and more responsive to changing needs:
(a) alleviate the existing inequality among provinces (para. 1.16), by
setting aside 50 to 100 student places each year in the residential
programs of the more developed provincial IOEs, as well as the three



- 15 -
proposed municipal IOEs, for students from poor rural areas and
minority students from autonomous regions;
(b) gradually raise the teaching load of IOE faculty members by 502 from
the current 4 to 8 hours per week to about 6 to 12 hours (para.
1.17). This increase would be applied to both the proposed IOEs
(about 11,200 faculty members in 1986) and non-project IOEs (14,000
faculty members) in 17 provinces and three municipalities included
in the project. Under the Government plan the project IOEs will
meet the target of raising average weekly teaching hours by 1993 and
non-project IOEs by 1995. It is expected that this increase would
ultimately lead to a similar increase in weekly teaching hours for
JNC anm normal universities faculty members (59,000 and 22,000
teaching staff, respectively, in 1986);
(c) revise the IOE curriculum, beginning in 1989 (para. 1.18), to
prepare lower secondary school teachers to teach two subjects
instead of only one as at present. The dual subject combinations
would depend on the relationship between the contents of the two
subjects, and the needs of the catchment areas of the IOEs and IOE
staff capability. This policy will improve the efficiency of the
lower secondary schools, particularly in rural schools which do not
have enough classes for single subject teachers to teach a full
load, and would raise the quality of rural schools which cannot
afford to hire single subject specialists. By the end of the
project period 50X of the proposed IOEs would introduce two-subject
teacher training programs;
{d) raise the female participation in inservice lower secondary teacher
training (from an average of 272 of total enrollment in 1986 to
about 402 in 1993) by increasing intake in correspondence/ETV
programs and through active recruitmient campaign 1para. 1.20);
(e) ensure that each PBOE will provide adequate funds to equip lower
secondary science laboratories (28 million students enrolled in
about 61,000 schools in 1986), in accordance with the SEdC guide-
lines, which is satisfactory to the Association, during the project
period; and
(f)  the provincial IOEs will increase the annual intake of lower
secondary teacher trainees to at least 702 of the total annual
intake of all the training program over the project period.
2.14      A Commitment to undertake the above actions by the provincial and
municipal governments was a condition for inclusion in the proposed project as
established by the SEdC. The Government has prepared detailed action plans
including implementation timetables (1988-93) for the above measures which
were discussed at negotiations. Tne Government plans to carry out these
measures during the project implementation period, based on the understanding
reached.

Basis of Cost Estimates
3.2       Base costs refer to March 1988 p ices.61  Civil works costs were
estimated on the basis of unit costs per ml in recent building contracts
awarded by the provincial governments, taking into account the type of build-
ing and thy,regional cost differences. Space requirements were based on SEdC
standards.-/ Equipment costs are based on bid prices for recently imported
similar equipment and on recent local prices for miscellaneous items included
in the equipment list for each type of institution. Local training costs are
based upon current costs at Chinese universities, appropriately adjusted for
the shorter lengths of the training sessions and for the travel and subsis-
tence costs required to bring tOE staff to central locations for the month-
long mant:gement courses and for the one-week seminars in pedagogy. Two-year
overseas f-llowships for the master's degree have been estimated at US$15,000
per year, one year Visiting Scholar programs at US$12,000, and month-long
overseas study tours at US$7,000 per tour. Costs of foreign specialists have
been estimated at an average of US$8,000 per man-month, consisting of fees and
6/   Scheduled date of negotiations.
7/   The Finance and Planning Department of SEDC sets standards on the unit
area per student for different levels of education. These standards are
used throughout China to allocate capital expenditures for enrollment
increases.



- 18 -
per diem, US$600 for travel within China, and US$2,000 for travel to and from
the home office.
Foreign Exchange Component
3.3       The foreign exchange component is estimated as follows:  civil works
and furniture, 11X; instructional equipment, 20Z; books and teaching
materials, 20%; overseas training, 96Z; cpecialists, 89X; and local training
and local specialists, 0Z. The foreign exchange component of instructional
equipment and books and teaching materials is based upon an assessment of the
probability of foreign suppliers winning equipment procurement contracts, and
the probable proportion of books and teaching materials that will be foreign-
produced.
Contingency Allowances
3.4       Physical contingencies are estimated at 10Z of the base costs of
project items. Price contingencies have been calculated on the basis of
expected international price increases of 3% for 1987, 1X for 1988-90, and 3Z
for subsequent years, and expected domestic price increases of 6.5Z for 1987-
90, and 4.5Z for subsequent years. Accordingly, aggregated price increases
are estimated at about 6.7Z of baseline costs plus physical contingencies.
Total contingencies are estimated to be 17% of baseline costs.
3.5       The project cost includes the indirect cost of import duties and
taxes on building materials and materials for locally manufactured equipment,
which have not been identified separately because the amount is negligible and
is financed by the Government. Imported instructional equipment and technical
assistance are exempt from import duties and taxes, respectively.
B. Financing
Capital Costs
3.6       As Table 3.3 indicates the IDA Credit would finance 100Z of the
costs of the equipment, books and teaching materials, overseas fellowships,
specialists' services, and the cost of the local training of the IOE teaching
staff. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Central Government
would make the proceeds of the Credit funds available to the project
provinces, municipalities, and prefectures on terms and conditions satisfac-
tory to the Association. The Credit funds would be onlent at an annual
interest rate of 2%, repayable over a period of 20 years, including a 5 year
grace period. The provincial and municipal governments would finance 100Z of
the costs of construction and furniture.

Operating Costs
3.7       The project would entail two changes in operations that would yield
significant improvements in efficiency. First, participating IOEs would be
required to increase their average teaching hours by 502 (para. 2.13 (b)).
Even after paying teachers higher compensation for their increased work, unit
costs would fall because of an increase in teaching hours. Second, the
expansion in enrollments would include a shift toward more efficient programs
of correspondence training and ETV which would yield additional savings. The
two project-related changes imply that the 542 increase in enrollment (para.
2.4) can be achieved with only about a 42X increase in recurrent expendi-
tures. The project IOEs would therefore achieve a significant improvement in
the efficiency of their production of qualified graduates. IOEs not partici-
pating in the project would also be similarly affected through a 502 increase
in teaching hours (para. 2.13(b)) and through changes in the mode of training
as they expand. The efficiency gains in them would be less, hor'ever, because
of their lower rate of enrollment expansion. The budgets for IOEs are small
relative to total spending on education within the provinces, representing
only about 122 of total education spending in 1986. The project IOEs comprise
262 of the total number of IOEs. Therefore, the incremental operating costs
associated with the expansion of the project IOEs would in most provinces be
less than 302 of their total spending on IOEs, or less than 32 of their total
education spending. This component would not entail a significant budgetary
burden for the provincial governments. It is well within the projected
expansion of educational budgets, and the provincial governments would be
further helped by anticipated lower demands for primary school teachers and
their training.



- 20 -
C. Implementation
3.8       SEdC would be responsible for implementing the project and would be
the Government's interlocutor with the Association on project matters, similar
to implementation arrangements for other Bank Group-financed education
projects. Overall direction would be provided by a Steering Committee
comprising the Vice-Minister of the SEdC and senior officers of the various
bureaus of the SEdC that would be involved in project implementation-the
Foreign Investment and Loan Office (FILO), the Planning and Finance Depart-
ment, the Teacher Training Department, and the External Affairs Bureau. A
senior officer of the Teacher Training Department, in cooperation with the
FILO, would be responsible for all pedagogical aspects of the project, includ-
ing the enactment at the provincial/municipal level of agreements reached with
the Association. FILO would be the coordinating and executing arm of the SEdC
for the day-to-day management of the project. FILO is well staffed for this
responsibility; it consists of a Project Coordination Division, Procurement
Division, Technical Assistance Division, Finance Division, and Administrative
Support Division. In addition, it has already managed the implementation of
four Bank-Group financed education projects and is therefore experienced with
the tasks associated with the proposed project. Through the above divisions,
FILO would directly manage domestic staff training and recruitment of domestic
specialists, but would engage an agency to implement the overseas fellowship
program and recruitment of foreign specialists included in the technical
assistance porLion of the project, procuring the equipment through direct
purchase or Local Competitive Bidding (LCB), as well as submitting withdrawal
requests and maintaining financial accounts. For the procurement of equipment
through International Competitive Bidding (ICB), FILO would contract the China
National Technology Import Corporation (CNTIC) under the Ministry of Foreign
Economic Relations and Trade, which is responsible for the international
procurement of equipment.
3.9       Although the SEdC woulc. be the focal point of project implementation
and is responsible for maintainir,g national standards of education, including
teacher training, considerable responsibility for the proposed project would
be devolved to the Provinces and Municipalities included in the project. In
essence, each Province and Municipality would be responsible for the financing
and supervision of the civil works program in the proposed project, the review
of existing instructional equipment in each project IOE and the approval of
the respective IOE's requests for additional equipment to be forwarded to SEdC
for purchase under the proposed project, the review and financing of the IOE's
staff development plans through local training programs to be forwarded to the
SEdC, and the approval and forwarding to the SEdC of the IOE's requests for
overseas training of provincial and municipal IOE staff and the services of
foreign specialists. The specific responsibilities of the Provinces/
Municipalities and the SEdC will be formalized in Project Iwplementation
Agreements acceptable to the Association, which will be signed by the
Governors of the project Provinces and Mayors of the Municipalities and the
responsible Vice-Minister of the SEdC. The Government would bring these
agreements in draft form to negotiations for discussion. Assurances would be
obtained at negotiations that the Project Implementation Agreements would be
concluded as a condition of Credit effectiveness.



- 21 -
3.10      To carry out these responsibilities, each project Province and
Municipality has established a Project Implementation Office (PIO), typically
staffed as shown in Anney 8. The PIO is usually headed b--: the Deputy Director
of the Provincial/Municipal Education Bureau who would be the link between the
Province/Municipality and the SEdC. PIO periodic progress reports and all
requests to the SEdC would be forwarded through him. The PIOs include
representation by the most senior staff in the relevant provincial/municipal
bureaus such as Planning and Finance. At the same time, the Provincial PIOs
have close working relations with the responsible units at prefectural
level. As such, they are well-staffed to provide the overall direction for
the Province's role in the proposed project, to handle any policy issues, and
to adjudicate promptly any possible disputes or problems that may arise at the
provincial or prefectural IOE level.
3.11      A PIO has also been established in each project IOE (Annex 8).
Either the President or the Vice President of the IOE has been named as the
Director of the PIO. As such, he would forward periodic progress reports to
the Head of the Provincial/Municipal PIO and all requests for assistance to
the Province/Municipality and the SEdC. The Chairmen and Chiefs of the other
relevant departments and sections, such as Teaching and Studies Affairs,
Equipment, Construction, Finance and Planning, are members of the PIOs. The
PIO staffs are usually augmented by two or three assistants, clerks and
accountant. None of the Directors would be a PIO member on a full-time
basis. The installation and maintenance of project equipment and the
supervision of project construction would, however, occupy essentially the
full-time of the Directors of the Equipment and Construction Departments,
respectively. The PIOs are well organized, however, and regard the proposed
project with such obviously high priority that sufficient attention to project
implementation would be assured. Nevertheless, during negotiations, the
Government agreed that the PIOs would continue to function throughout the
project implementation period, with functions and responsibilities acceptable
to the Association. Adequate numbers of staff, both support and senior staff,
would be provided on a full-time basis, if and when needed, during peak
periods of project implementation.
3.12      More specifically, the Institute PIOs would be responsible for:
(a)  the coordination of the scheduling of construction and the
procurement of equipment;
(b)  the compilation, approval and forwarding of equipment requests to
the provincial/municipal PIOs;
(c)  the receipt and, together with the relevant department and section,
inspection of delivered equipment and related claims;
(d)  local training of teaching staff;
(e)  identification of teaching staff suitable for overseas training;
(f)  liaison with SEdC, through the provinciaL/municipal PIO, on the
utilization of foreign specialists; and



- 22 -
(g) maintaining all project accounts.
The Institute PIOs would prepare statements of expenditures (SOE) and would be
responsible for preparing annual project account and progress reports for
forwarding to the Association through the provincial/municipal PIO and the
SEdC.
3.13      The IOE departments constitute the basic units of the proposed
project. Here the Department Chairman, assisted by the teaching staff,
formulated the lists of required instructional equipment, the space require-.
ments, and the plans for upgrading the department's teaching staff. These
were submitted to the provincial/municipal PIO and the SEdC for approval and
inclusion in the proposed project. Although not a formal member of the
Institute PIO, each Department Chairman would be expected to maintain a close
working relationship with the Institute PIO on project matters throughout
implementation, and would be ultimately responsible for the receipt, inspec-
tion, installation, operation and maintenance of each department's instruc-
tional equipment. Each department now has the capability of maintaining all
of the laboratory equipment that it has at present, including such items as
computers and video equipment. In anticipation of receiving relatively
sophisticated equipment under the proposed project, IOE Department Chairman
are planning to send laboratory staff to learn and work for one year in the
laboratories of NUs in order to become familiar witih such equipment and to be
able to maintain it. In addition, selected IOE staff members would attend NUs
for one year of instruction in the use and maintenance of laboratory equipment
(para. 2.6).
3.14      Each IOE is responsible for the implementation of its building
program, with the approval and the financing provided by the Province/
Municipality. The IOE Construction Section:
(a) engages a local architect to prepare the sketch plans, technical
specifications, working drawings, cost estimates, and detailed
implementation plans;
(b) supervises the local bidding procedures for construction; and
(c) with the approval of the President of the IOE, awards the
construction contract.
It then maintains close on-site supervision of the construction. About one-
third of the construction proposed for inclusion in the proposed project is in
an advanced stage and is scheduled for completion by mid-1988. Construction
of the balance is scheduled to begin in mid-1988 and to be completed in late
1989 and early 1990. Because of their advanced stage, review by IDA of the
sketch plans and working drawings would not have been meaningful. Instead,
the Government intends to employ the services of a facility planner under the
technical assistance portion of the proposed project (para. 2.11) to improve
the planning of school buildings, and has evidenced a strong desire to ensure
that future school buildings will be more functional and economical.



- 23 -
3.15      The SEdC has prepared a standard list of instructional equipment for
use in preparing teachers to teach in the lower secondary schools. This
standard list served as the basis for the preparation of equipment requests by
the IOEs. The list was first reviewed and modified by the Association and
later by a 14 man team of local equipment experts employed by the SEdC. The
team of local equipment experts visited each project IOE and compared the
IOE's equipment requests with the equipment on hand. The Association then
reviewed the recommendations of the local equipment experts, and final
agreement between the Government and the Association was reached on the
content of the equipment lists. The equipment requests by each IOE, as
modified by both the Association and the government's team, were submitted to
the SEdC for approval and procurement. FILO would be responsible for super-
vision and preparation of the technical specifications (para. 3.8) required
for procurement.
3.16      SEdC officials would provide guidance and assistance to the
provincial/municipal and IOE officials, which would help to overcome their
lack of experience with Bank Group-financed projects. Implementation of the
various project components is therefore likely to follow the implementation
schedule (Annex 9). Key implementation dates are shown in Annex 10.
Estimated schedule of project's first year activities is detailed in
Annex 11. All equipment, books and teaching materials are expected to be
purchased by end of 1990. Staff development, both local and overseas,
however, would not be completed until mid-1992 (see Annex 12 for details of TA
component), and together with some remaining construction would require a
Completion Date of December 31, 1992. The Closing Date would be December 31,
1993.
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
3.17      Progress towards meeting project objectives would be monitored in
two broad areas and with three tools. The two areas would be:
(a) achievements in lower secondary teacher upgrading in terms of
quantity and quality; and
(b) progress in implementing project components. The three tools would
be:
(i) annual progress reports using indicators to track progress; and
(ii) the Association's progress review missions; and
(iii) a mid-term review.
IDA missions would review status of progress towards the achievement of
targets, but in addition would review the overall progress of the project and
would, when needed, focus on specific issues. The midterm review would take
place during April and September 1991. The overall evaluation would be after
project c3mpletion in December 1992 and the results would be included in the
PCR due in June 1993. Responsibility for preparing the completion report
would rest with the Steering Committee, which would be assisted by the



- 24 -
Provincial/Municipal/Prefectural PIOs and departments/divisions involved in
the project. The Government is expected to implement the project-supported
improvement measures of the teacher training system (para. 2.13). Assurances
were provided at negotiations that the Government would:
(a) by April 1, 1989 and annually thereafter provide the Association
for review and comment a progress report on the implementation of
the project-supported improvement measures to assess progress
during the previous school year; and
(b) hold a mid-term review of the implementation of the new measures
jointly with the Association during April and September 1991.
Project monitoring indicators are shown in Annex 13.
Status of Project Preparation
3.18         The proposed project is in an advanced stage of preparation.
Forty-two percent of the IOE building program has already been completed, 21Z
is under construction and scheduled for completion by mid-1988, and the
balance will be started in mid-1988 and completed by the end of 1989 or early
1990. Equipment lists and major specifications have been reviewed and are
satisfactory (para. 3.15). The procurement of equipment is expected to begin
soon after Credit effectiveness. Efforts will be made to complete fellowship
selection by mid-1988 for the first group of scholars and to place them in
overseas institutions in September 1989. Local training is expected to
commence in September 1988.
D. Procurement
3.19         Procurement procedures would be essentially the same as in
previous China education projects and are sulmmarized below:

/a   Direct purchase for proprietary items, or where justified by need for

/b   International and local shopping.
Note:     Figures in parentheses denote the amount of the Association's
financing.
3.20      All civil works and furniture would be financed by the Provincial,
Municipal and Prefectural Governments.  The Credit would finance about
US$43.6 m equivalent of instructional equipment, including books, journals and
teaching materials, and about US$6.4 m equivalent of TA. About 352 of the
equipment would be procured through ICB and the remainder through LCB,
international and local shopping or direct purchase. Books and teaching
materials in the amount of US$3.6 m equivalent would be obtained directly from
either publishers or suppliers on the basis of international and local
shopping procedures acceptable to the Association.
3.21      The SEdC has indicated that it intends to group the most expensive
and sophisticated equipment items to form one bid package of about US$14 m
equivalent, which would be procured following ICB procedures. The
International Tendering Company of the CNTIC would manage the procurement for
this package, as it has for previous education projects, on behalf of FILO in
SEdC (para. 3.8). For purposes of comparing foreign and local bids under ICB,
local manufacturers of equipment would be allowed a margin of preference equal
to the existing rate of customs duties applicable to competing imports or 15S



- 26 -
of the CIF price, whichever is lower. About US$2.0 m of items that must be
compatible with existing equipment and proprietary items would be purchased
directly, in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Association. The
balance, comprising contracts less than US$200,000 each and US$24.0 m
equivalent in aggregate, would be obtained through LCB procedures satisfactory
to the Association. This equipment, which is relatively simple and for which
local unit prices are quite low, would be unlikely to attract foreign
suppliers. In addition, equipment packages would vary from province to
province and would be procured at various times.
3.22      The   *ociation would review the bidding documents before ICB, the
first LCB bidd.ng document prior to tendering, and all subsequent bidding
documents for equipment estimated to cost more than US$500,000 equivalent.
For all other contracts, the Association would retain the right to review the
awards ex post. All specialists would be selected and appointed in accordance
with the IBRD/IDA Guidelines for the Use of Consultants, dated August 1981.
E. Disbursements
3.23      The credit of US$50.0 m equivalent would be disbursed over a period
of 5.5 years (Table 3.5). Disbursements would be made on the basis of:
(a) 100Z of the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment, books and journals,
or the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment and 751 of
local expenditures for other items procured locally;
(b) 100Z of expenditures for specialists;
(c) 100Z of expenditures for overseas fellowships and study tours; and
(d) 100Z of expenditures for local training of IOE teaching staff.
The disbursement profile of the proposed project reflects an anticipated rate
of withdrawal much higher than the average education project. This has proven
to be true of all previous education projects in China.

Closing Date: December 31, 1993
3.24      In order to facilitate the Association's processing of disbursement
applications, the minimum level of withdrawal would be US$200,000. Disburse-
ment applications for contracts valued at US$200,000 or more would be sub-
mitted to the Association with two copies of the contracts and, if applicable,
other supporting documents. For goods and services contracts, each valued at
less than $200,000 equivalent, study tours and fellowships, SOEs certified by
authorized Provincial/Municipal Government officials would be used. Under SOE
procedures, contracts and/or other supporting documents would be retained by
the Provincial and Municipal PIOs and FILO and, upon request, would be made
available for review by visiting missions from the Association. Disbursements
against SOEs would be made on the basis of a consolidated summary, each not
less than US$500,000. Disbursements for other project expenditures would be
made against rull documentaLion.



- 28 -
3.25      A Special Account would be opened and maintained in US dollars in a
bank acceptable to the Association to facilitate disbursements for eligible
project expenditures. An initial amount in US$5.0 m equivalent to SDR 3.6 m
would be deposited into the Special Account. This should be sufficient to
cover all eligible project expenditures during any six months period except
for the peak year of FY90. Applications for replenishment of the Special
Account would be submitted quarterly to the Association, or when amounts
withdrawn are about 50Z of the initial deposit, whichever occurs first.
F. Accounts and Audits
3.26      Project accounts and details of the Special Account would be
maintained by FILO. The Audit Administration of the People's Republic of
China would audit these cash flows accounts. During negotiations, agreement
was reached that:
(a) project accounts would be maintained by the FILO and all the PIOs
according to normal and satisfactory accounting practices;
(b)  annual audit reports prepared by the State Audit Administration
would be submitted to the Association within eight months of the end
of the Government's fiscal year; and
(c) a separate opinion on the SOEs would be submitted to the Association
together with the audit report.
Within six months of the Closing Date, the Steering Committee, assisted by
PIOs, would submit a PCR to the Association.
IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Benefits
4.1       The principal benefits of the proposed project would be:
(a) expanded and improved lower secondary teacher training institutions
in 16 provinces and three municipalities included in the project;
(b) improved cost-effectiveness in inservice teacher training system;
(c) demonstration effects for non-project institutions in the project
provinces and for others; and
(d) enhanced capability of planning, curriculum development, management,
and research and evaluation.
Improvement in the quality of the lower secondary education would be achieved
by:
(a) the provision of facilities and laboratory equipment that would make
possible the upgrading of 178,000 unqualified lower secondary
teachers, 18X of about one million unqualified lower secondary
teachers who are trainable; and



- 29 -
(b)  the Government's comitment to provide basic science equipment to
about 402 of total lower secondary schools (about 61,000 schools
with 28 million students), which are not provided with basic science
equipment.
Improved cost-efficiency would be achieved through:
(a) a shift in emphasis toward highly cost-effective correspondence
couroes complemented by satellite education; and
(b) a 50X increase in teaching hours per IOE teacher (about 11,200
project and 14,000 non-project IOE teachers). This change in IOE
teaching hours is expected to generate pressure for a corresponding
increase in the teaching load for all the JNCs (59,000 teachers) and
Normal Universities (22,000 teachers), and possibly for secondary
schools.
A decision to give higher priority to correspondence/ETV courses would help
increase the female participation rate in inservice teacher training (from a
low 271 in 1986 to 40X in 1993). The new measures in the teacher training
inetitutions preparing teachers to teach two subjects in the lower secondary
schools instead of only one, as at present, would result in substantial
financial savings. Demonstration effects of the proposed project combined
with the above new measures would be significant nationwide. Finally,
capabilities in planning, curriculum development, management, and research and
evaluation would be enhanced through the provision of relevant staff
development and specialist services at the central, provincial and municipal
levels.
B. Risks
4.2       The major risk is delays arising from the inexperience of and
variation in the ability of provincial, municipal and prefectural officials in
the implementation of an IDA-financed project. This risk will be reduced
considerably by the participation of FILO (para. 3.8) which is experienced in
the implementation of four Bank Group-financed education projects and which
will be responsible for local procurement of equipment and the major share of
the technical assistance program. In addition, no major problems are antici-
pated in view of:
(a) the excellent performance in project implementation exhibited by
SEdC in the University Development Projecra and the Polytechnic/
Television University Project, where the beneficiaries are also
provincial institutions;
(b) the active involvement of SEdC in overall project coordination; and
(c) the strong commitment shown during preappraisal by the Provinces and
Muricipalities to provide counterpart funds and the best profess-
ional and administrative staff to implement the project. ICB
procurement would be conducted by CNTIC, the central agency



- 30 -
responsible for ICB in China, which has had extensive experience
with Bank-financed projects. Moreover, IDA staff would provide
assistance and training in project implementation through frequent
and extended review missions.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.1       During negotiations the Government has agreed to the
following:
(a) the three municipal IOEs would carry out the three studies with
Terms of Reference and specific timing for each study agreed with
the Association, and the results of the studies wo4ld be furnished
to the Association for comment promptly upon completion (para. 2.8);
(b) a Coordinating Committee would be established in the SEdC by
December 31, 1988, including representatives of the three municipal
IOEs, to coordinate the proposed studies and other research
activities and specialist services to realize the full potential of
the municipal IOEs (para. 2.10);
{c) the Government would carry out the TA program as agreed with the
Association (para. 2.12);
(d) the Central Government would make the proceeds of the Credit funds
available to the project provinces, municipalities, and prefectures
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association (para. 3.6);
(e) PIOs would continue to function throughout the project implementa-
tion period with functions and responsibilities acceptable to the
Association (para. 3.11);
(f) the Government would: (i) by April 1, 1989 and annually thereafter
provide the Association for review and comment a progress report on
the implementation of the project-supported improvement measures of
the teacher training system (paras. 2.13 and 3.17) to assess
progress during the previous school year; and (ii) hold a mid-term
review of the implementation of the new measures jointly with the
Association (para. 3.17); and
(g) the PILO and PIO would uiintain project accounts according to normal
and satisfactory accounting practices; (ii) an.-ai audit reports
prepared by the State Audit Administration would be submitted to the
Association within eight months of the end of the Government's
fiscal year; and (iii) a separate opinion on the SOEs would be
submitted to the Association together with the audit reports
(para. 3.26).
5.2       A condition for Credit effectiveness would be approval by the State
Council of the Development Credit Agreement and the conclusions of Project
Implementation Agreements acceptable to the Association, which will be signed



- 31 -
by the Governors of the project provinces and Mayors of the Municipalities and
the responsible Vice-Minister of the SEdC (para. 3.9).
5.3       Subject to the above conditions, the project would constitute a
suitable basis for an IDA credit of SDR 36.8 million (US$50.0 million
equivalent) on standard IDA terms, with 35 years maturity, to the People's
Republic of China.

TEACHER TRAINING PROJECT
Technical Assistance Program
1.        The technical assistance (TA) component of the proposed project as
shown in the attached Table 1 is designed to accomplish the following:
(a)  improve the management skills of key administrators of the 72
project IOEs, the 16 provincial educational bureaus, and the SEdC;
(b)  upgrade the teaching staffs of the project IOEs in terms of their
knowledge of: (i) the subject matter of the courses they teach and;
(b) the most advanced developments in China and abroad in the teach-
ing methodologies employed in such courses, both in the classroom
and the laboratory; and
sc)  develop expertise in specialized areas such as curriculum develop-
ment, educational planning, facilities planning, library management
and computer science applications in educatien management in the
SEdC and the three municipal lOEs that wiii be responibLe fv.o dis-
seminating developments in these areas to the provincial education
bureaus and the project IOEs.
Local Training
2.        The local Normal Universities (Nus) are competent to train the IOE
staff in the management of the IOEs and in all of the subjects offered by the
IOEs. Therefore, overseas training would not be necessary except in pedagogy,
methodology, modern education techniques, including computer-assisted manage-
ment, and foreign languages. As 16 NUs have agreed to participate in the TA
program (attached Table 2), the largest part of the program would consist of
training to be provided in China by these NUs, as follows:
(a) one month courses in the management of the IOEs would be provided in
the NUs to 288 IOE administrators and 80 provincial education bureau
staff;
(b) staff upgrading in course content and teaching methodologies would
be accomplished by three separate programs:
(i) 217 NU teachers would be assigned for one year each to IOEs to
conduct one semester courses in which 3,280 IOE teaching staff
and 30 provincial education bureau staff are expected to partici-
pate;
(ii) 800 IOE staff would attend NUs for one year and 1,700 IOE staff
would attend NUs for one-half year. The principal thrust of this
program would be to combine instruction in laboratory methodology
with instruction in equipment operation and maintenance; and



-52-
ANNEX 12
Page 2 of 3
(iii)  144 one-week seminars in how to teach each of the major IOE
subjects would be conducted at four strategically located centers
during the project implementation period. Each pedagogy expert,
whether local or expatriate, would conduct a group of four
seminars at intervals of about one year. Travel and subsistence
costs to enable trainees from surrounding areas to assemble at
the seminar site would be included in the project costs. As the
class size of each seminar is estimated to be 30, 4,320 IOE staff
members are expected to participate in these pedagogy seminars.
Overseas Training
3.        The overseas training program would consists of the following:
(a) Master's Degree Program. A two year fellowship would be provided to
one staff member from each of the provincial IOEs and the municipal
IOEs to upgrade his knowledge of his specialization.
(b) Visiting Scholar Program. 120 selected staff members of the project
IOEs would attend overseas universities for one year as Visiting
Scholsrse Three staff memer. would be selected from each of the
provincial and municipal IOEs, two from each of the ten city IOEsp
and the balance from the prefectural IOEs. Because the objective of
this program would not be a degree, the programs of studies would
not be as structured; the resulting greater flexibility would enable
the Visiting Scholars to study the combination of subjects that
would best suit their particular needs.
(c) Study Tours. One staff member from each project IOE and a total of
14 staff from the provincial education bureaus and the SEdC would
visit educational institutions abroad for one month. Educational
institutions to be visited would be selected on the basis of their
status as leaders in the field of teacher training, development of
