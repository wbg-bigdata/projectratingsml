MEMORAI.DUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A TEACHER TRAINING PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed develop-
ment credit to the People's Republic of China for SDR 36.8 million (US$50.0
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be
on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity and would help finance a teacher
training project.
2.        Background.  The Government of China has set a target to achieve
nine years of Universal Basic Education (UBE) in stages by the year 2000.
Since the national net enrollment ratio at the primary level (grades 1-6) is
already 96%, and with declining enrollments due to success in slowing
population growth, the present output of primary school teachers will be
sufficient to meet UBE targets as well as replacing the 39% of the current
primary school teachers who are considered unqualified. The enrollment ratio
at the lower secondary level (grades 7-9), however, is only 51%. Universal
education at this level would require an increase in enrollment of about 22
million students by the year 2000 and an increase in the number of lower
secondary school teachers' credentials of a3out 900,000. Moreover, 73% of the
present 2.2 million lower secondary teachers do not have the required
education credentials. Upgrading of these lower secondary teachers'
credentials is therefore critical to achieving the Government's nine-year UBE
target.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  To date, almost all Bank Group
investment in China's education sector has been in higher education. The Bank
Group will continue its strategy of further strengthening higher education to
meet higher level manpower needs. With the education component of the Gansu
Provincial Development Project (Ln. 2812/Cr. 1793-CHA), the Bank initiated
work in the basic education area. The proposed project would provide the Bank
Group with its first opportunity to assist the Government to address urgent
needs for the national teacher training system to meet the mandate for the
nine-year UBE. This project would be followed by a textbook project which
would complement the proposed project.  Achieving the UBE supported by an
expanded and improved teacher training system is an important aspect of the
overall strategy to strengthen education's contribution to reform and devel-
opment in China. Selection of provinces and municipalities for the proposed
project was based on: (a) a large gap between projected demand and supply of
qualified lower secondary teachers; and (b) a commitment to undertake
significant policy actions (para. 6) that would improve efficiency and cost
effectiveness of the entire teacher training system and lower secondary
education. The Government plans to improve and expand inservice lower
secondary teacher training with its own resources in the remaining provinces
and autonomous regions.



4.        Project Ob ectives.  The objectives of the proposed project are to:
(a) improve the quality of in service training of lower secondary school
teachers; (b) increase the output from the in service lower secondary school
teacher training program; (c) improve the management capability of national,
provincial, and municipal education administrators in teacher training
systems; (d) increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the lower
secondary school teacher training system through assisting the SEDC in
implementing new policy actions; and (e) help alleviate inequality among
provinces and raise female participation in teacher training.
5.        Project Description.  The project would have three components.  The
first component would assist 16 provincial and 52 prefectural institutes of
education (IOEs) to expand and improve their capability in meeting the urgent
demand for qualified lower secondary teachers. The second component would
assist three municipal IOEs (Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai) to become clearing
houses for gathering, evaluating and disseminating information on teacher
training curriculum, methodology and materials, and research and evaluation
centers on key policy issues in teacher training. The third component is
designed to improve the planning, curriculum development, and management
capability of the SEDC and local education authorities. The proposed project
would provide: construction, equipment, books and teaching materials, and
related technical assistance (TA) for the first and second project components;
and TA for the third component.
6.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to undertake the follow-
ing actions to improve the teacher training system in parallel with the
proposed project: (a) setting aside a sufficient number of student places each
year in the in-service training programs of the more developed provincial and
municipal IOEs for students from poor rural areas and minority students from
autonomous regions; (b) rai.ing the average teaching load of IOE faculty
members by 50% in both project and non-project IOEs during the project period;
(c) revising the IOE curriculum to prepare lower secondary teachers to teach
two subjects instead of one subject and experimenting with the new curriculum
in at least 50% of the project IOEs by 1993; (d) raising female participation
in lower secondary in service training by 50% from its current level of 27%
over the project period; (e) providing lower secondary schools in the project
provinces/municipalities with adequate science equipment during the project
period; and (f) increasing provincial IOEs' annual intake of lower secondary
teacher trainees to at least 70% of the total annual intake of all the
training programs over the project period. In addition, the Government has
agreed that: (a) the three municipal IOEs would undertake studies of: (i)
the cost-effectiveness of alternative inservice teacher training systems; (ii)
the training of dual-subject teachers; and (iii) the methods of increasing
female participation in the teacher training system, as agreed with IDA; (b)
it would establish a Coordinating Committee in the SEDC to coordinate research
activities and specialists' services provided to the municipal IOEs; (c) it
would carry out the TA program as agreed with IDA; (d) it would provide annual
reports on progress with the parallel actions; and (e) it would hold a mid-
term project review with IDA.
7.        Benefits.  The principal benefits of the proposed project would be
expanded and improved lower secondary in service training institutions in the



-3-
17 provinces and three municipalities inclu4ed in the project, upgrading of
about 178,000 unqualified lower secondary tea '.ers, and improved cost-
effectiveness in in service teacher training. There would be a 501 increase
in average IOE teaching hours, covering about 11,200 project IOE teachers and
about 14,000 non-project IOE teachers, and ultimately 71,000 faculty members,
at Junior Normal Colleges and Normal Universities, and increased emphasis on
much more cost-effective correspondence/ETV courses. In addition to the
demonstration effects of the expanded and more cost-effective teacher
training, there would be enhanced capability for planning, curriculum develop-
ment, management, and research and evaluation through staff development and
specialist services. In addition, the Government's commitment to equip lower
secondary school science laboratories in the project provinces and municipali-
ties would affect about 70% of nearly 28 million students enrolled in 61,000
lower secondary schools which lack appropriate science equipment.
8.        Risks.  The major risk of the project would lie in the inexperience
of provincial, municipal, and prefectural officials in the implementation of a
Bank Group-financed project. This risk would be reduced considerably by the
participation of SEDC, which already has experience in implementing four Bank
Group-financed education projects.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
