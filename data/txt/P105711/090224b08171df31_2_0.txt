            IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT MISSION FOR
AFRICA STOCKPILES PROGRAMME – Project 1 (ASP-P1) – P105711/TF090543
                     September 26 – 30, 2011


I.       INTRODUCTION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

An implementation support mission of the Ethiopia Africa Stockpiles Programme (ASP) was
conducted in Addis Ababa from September 26 to 30, 2011.1 This mission was the first after ASP
restructuring was approved by the World Bank’s Executive Board of Directors in June 2011. The
mission’s objectives were to i) discuss changes introduced through the recent ASP restructuring;
ii) discuss project implementation progress since the last supervision mission2; iii) agree on a
consolidated Project Work and Procurement Plans for the remaining project period; iv) assess
ways to support the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) in finalizing the bid process for the disposal
contract; v) review progress in the preparation of the Country Environmental and Social
Assessment (CESA) for safeguarding and removal of obsolete pesticides and the Environmental
and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the construction of a new pesticide store; vi) review the
linkage between ASP and the recently launched Pesticide Risk Reduction Programme; vii)
discuss options to bridge the funding gap for the removal of obsolete pesticides and associated
wastes; and vii) follow up on ASP compliance with fiduciary and safeguard polices.

The mission wishes to thank the GoE, in particular Ato Fikre Markos (Deputy Director of the
Animal and Plant Health Regulatory Directorate) of the MoA, and Dr Tesfaye Alemu (Senior
Expert, International Financial Institutions Cooperation Directorate, MoFED) for their full
support and cooperation as well as the ASP coordinator Ato Shimelis Hassen and his Project
Management Team (PMT) for excellent mission organization. The mission wishes to express its
gratitude to H.E. State Minister, Wondirad Mandefro, for his availability during the debriefing
meeting and expressing his strong support for ASP.

This Aide Memoire summarizes the main findings and agreements reached during, the mission.

II.           CONTEXT

ASP-Ethiopia was launched in July 2007 with an original closing date of June 30, 2011.
However, after the project launched, a more thorough inventory revealed that 200 tons more of
obsolete pesticides were available. In order to make the originally formulated PDO achievable,
ASP was restructured and the following changes were made:

  The Mission team consisted of Asferachew Abate (Environmental Specialist and TTL), Gabriele Rechbauer (Senior
Environmental Specialist), Shimelis Woldehawariat (Procurement Specialist), Meron Tadesse (Financial Management
Specialist) and Dawit Tadesse (Team Assistant).

Original PDO was to “Assist the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to eliminate
inventoried publicly-held obsolete pesticide stockpiles and associated waste, and implement
measures to reduce and prevent future related risks.?

 Revised PDO is to “Assist the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to eliminate and/or
safeguard inventoried publicly-held obsolete pesticide stockpiles and associated waste, and
develop a strategy for sustainable management of future accumulations.?

The PDO level indicators were revised as follows:

OI 1: Inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticides and associated waste disposed of and/or
safeguarded by the end of the project.

OI 2: A strategy for sustainable management of future accumulation adopted by the Steering
Committee by the end of the Project.

The restructuring has also resulted in a reallocation of proceeds and an extension of the project’s
closing date from June 30, 2011 to December 31, 2012.


III.           KEY FINDINGS

Project Implementation Performance: Project implementation has been slow since the last
supervision mission which was conducted in October 2010. One of the most important reasons
attributed to the slow ASP performance was the delay in approving the Country Environment and
Social Assessment (CESA) and Environment and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) reports
prepared by the project. It was also noted that the project did not achieve planned activities under
the prevention component of the project. The previous rating of achieving the PDO has been up-
graded from Unsatisfactory (U) to Moderately Satisfactory (MS) - see below for detailed project
ratings:

                                                                     Rating

The mission agreed that the project’s priorities for the remaining fifteen months are: i) the timely
and satisfactory completion of safeguarding and disposal of 450 tons of obsolete pesticides; ii) the
construction of a new pesticide store in the Kality area; and iii) the development of a sustainable
pesticide management strategy as well as initiating safeguarding of associated wastes (e.g. empty

containers).  A revised and up-dated work plan extracted from the detailed project
implementation and monitoring and evaluation plan for the remaining 15 months is attached in
Annex 5. A detailed action plan for the next five months is provided in Annex 1.

The mission has noted that a close follow-up from the PMT and the Bank is needed to speed-up
project implementation and achieve the PDO within the remaining tight project completion time.

Implementation performance and the mission’s recommendation related to each of the project’s
components are described below:

Component A: Obsolete Pesticides Inventory

Activities under this component were completed. A detailed inventory of publicly held obsolete
pesticides stocks and associated waste carried out, all data were entered into a database and
validated.

Component B: Safeguarding and/or disposal of publicly held obsolete pesticides stocks and
associated waste

CESA submitted to the Bank for non objection: A draft CESA was prepared and sent to the
Bank’s ASP safeguard specialist in February 2011 for comments. The CESA stipulated that the
MoA has the capacity to safeguard medium and low risk pesticides stores. The CESA includes an
EMP for safeguarding obsolete pesticide before disposal. During this mission, the final CESA has
been submitted to ASPEN for final review and no objection.

Draft bidding document for safeguarding and disposal has been prepared: The bidding
document for the disposal contract – including equipment for safeguarding of 450 tons and
disposal of approximately 300 tons of identified obsolete pesticide stocks- has been completed. A
final draft bidding document was submitted to the Bank for no objection in April 2011. The
bidding document has been reviewed by the Bank’s Procurement Specialist, ASP technical
consultants and FAO/TSU. The mission noted that the bid document requires safeguarding of the
high-risk MoH store to be done by an international company. Thus, a separate EMP for the high
risk MoH store as previously planned by the PMT is no longer required.

The mission identified the need for the PMT to up-date the final draft bidding document to: i)
reflect the accurate schedule; ii) to amend the amount of obsolete pesticides to be included (from
initial 250 tons to 300 tons based on review of the unit costs and reallocated budget available for
disposal); and iii) to verify adequacy of safeguarding equipment needed.

Additional funds are required: The mission confirmed that the project funds are only sufficient
to dispose 300 tons and safeguarding 150 tons of obsolete pesticides. The funding gap for the
disposal of these 150 tons of obsolete pesticides is estimated to be USD 500,0003. With regard to
the safeguarding and disposal of associated waste, the project budget includes the procurement of
a mobile shredder and a generator to shred empty plastic containers. The current budget only
allows for very limited piloting of actual safeguarding and/or disposal of empty containers. The
funding gap for safeguarding and disposing the 433 tons of associated waste excluding

3
  Unit cost/ton for safeguarding and disposal estimated at 2,750 EUR including packing material, road transportation to
Djibouti port, and maritime transport to EU facility and disposal. Noteworthy, unit costs in EUR may differ depending
on repackaging needs in addition to variations related to total volume of contract and an average EUR/USD exchange
rate of 1.40 has been used.

contaminated soils is roughly estimated at USD 2.4 million. The mission agreed on the need to
have a more detailed cost estimate for the safeguarding and disposal of associated waste. The
PMT took the responsibility to prepare the detailed and updated cost estimate in consultation with
FAO, CLI and other experts on this aspect. Such information should be made rapidly available to
MoFED and MoA as well as to the Bank to assess additional financing options. The GoE intends
to organize a donor roundtable in March 2012 where the ASP achievements as well as a draft
strategic pesticide management framework including container management and associated
funding needs for implementation would be presented. The Bank was requested to facilitate the
preparation of such roundtable.

Three hundred ninety five tons of Obsolete Pesticides removed: The mission noted that the long-
awaited disposal of 395 tons of obsolete pesticides (legacy stocks from predecessor FAO
projects) by a CLI contracted company in the UK. The national safeguard team participated in
refresher training on health and safety4 and safeguarded successfully 75 tons of associated waste.
The safeguarding and transportation operation was monitored by two MoA pesticide inspectors
who received technical training. The Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) was notified and
conducted a two days visit at the Gotera site.

Draft ToR for container management prepared: The PMT submitted the ToR for the container
management study to the Bank for no-objection in April 2011. It was noted that the ToR require
some major revisions to reflect the mission agreements on (i) the immediate procurement of the
plastic shredder; (ii) better alignment with the Pesticide Risk Reduction Programme (PRRP)
container management consultancy (aiming to regulatory national strategy for the management of
empty pesticides containers) and (iii) including pilots for safeguarding of empty containers in
priority locations. The assignments funded by PRRP and ASP are expected to complement each
other to establish a national system of safe collection of empty pesticide containers and
contaminated equipment, decontamination, recycling and safe final disposal. The mission agreed
to launch the immediate procurement of a mobile shredder and a generator. MoA agreed to
request a related recurrent budget for maintaining and operating the shredder and generator
starting from next fiscal year.

Component C: Reduction of Obsolete Pesticide and Associated Waste Re-Accumulation

Draft ESIA for the construction of a new pesticide store has been prepared: A final draft
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the construction of a pesticide store in
Kality Area/Addis Ababa for temporary storage of imported pesticides for migratory pests was
sent to the Bank’s safeguard consultant in April 2011. The ESIA has been submitted to ASPEN
for no objection in October 2011. The PMT received the Bank’s non-objection for recruiting a
consultant responsible for the store design review and supervision process in April 2011. A draft
bidding document is available but needs to be up-dated to match the final ESIA conclusions.

Draft ToR for sustainable pesticide management strategy has been prepared: A draft ToR for
sustainable pesticide management has been developed and submitted to the Bank for comments
and no-objection in January13, 2011. Under the restructuring, the relevance of such strategy has
been emphasized. The ToRs will require further input and improvement from key stakeholders
(i.e. PRRP, MoA, FAO, CLI) to incorporate the container management strategy to be developed
by PRRP and international lessons and good practices. The mission recommended increasing the
budget for the assignment by shifting the budget allocated for the EIA training.

     -    Radio and TV messages as well as print materials (brochures, calendars, etc.) have been
          developed in January 2011but have not yet been printed/distributed and/or aired. The
          mission urged the PMT to follow-up with the print material consultant to finalize the
          contract, print the media support and air the audio and TV messages. This will then
          trigger the associated training of stakeholders to use and distribute the media support in
          the regions.
     -    A three-day workshop was organized in May 2011 with 45 participants from
          Government, private sector and civil societies to raise awareness on the new
          proclamation on pesticide registration and control and to validate related draft
          regulations.

Capacity building:
   -     Pesticide management training (funded by CLI) was conducted for 29 crop protection
         staff from regional offices and commercial farms in December 2010 and a store
         management training (funded by CLI) was conducted for 28 pesticide store keepers in
         February 2011.
   -     A two-weeks safeguarding training was conducted by FAO in South Africa for 4
         PMT/MoA staff in December 2010.
   -     PMT’s financial management officer attended 2 weeks WB Financial Management
         training in Malawi in November 2010.
   -     The mission confirmed that the new PRRP/MoA project (FAO, NL/Wageningen) will
         focus on strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for pesticide management
         by building on ASP achievements and support. PRRP and ASP linkages have been
         identified at institutional level (same stakeholders in Steering Committee and national
         stakeholder forum) and at thematic /activity level related to legal/regulatory framework
         and development of sustainable container and pesticide management strategy. A
         coordination mechanism between MoA’s Pesticide Risk Reduction Programme (PRRP)
         and ASP is established and functional.
   -     The mission reassessed the need for keeping the delayed training on EIA in the work
         plan and concluded with the MoA that due to past training by FAO, the schedule for
         safeguarding and disposal of obsolete pesticides and the role of EPA, it was decided
         that the training could be removed from the work and procurement plans. The training
         budget will be reallocated to increase the budget for the sustainable pesticide
         management strategy consultancy.


Component D: Project Management

Restructuring:
   -     The amendment to the legal agreement signed by the GoE on July 29, 2011.

Reporting and Monitoring:
   -    Two progress reports (covering July – Dec. 2010 and Jan. – July 2011) were submitted
        to the Bank.

Procurement:
   -    The procurement plan was up-dated and received no-objection by the Bank in July
        2010. The mission had a discussion with the project staff on the status of
        implementation of the procurement aspect of the project. The implementation status of
        the project for all procurement packages was also reviewed with the team. The

            procurement management of the project is found to be unsatisfactory. Please see Annex
            3 for details.

Financial management
   -    The disbursement of the project proceeds as of September 30, 2011 amounts to USD
       628,745 (24 % of total grant of USD 2,620,000). It is the conclusion of this assessment
       that there is reasonable adequacy that the FM system provided the necessary reasonable
       assurance that Bank loan proceeds are being used for the intended purposes (please see
       Annex 2 for details). As a result of the supervision, the project’s FM rating is upgraded to
       Satisfactory whereas the FM risk of the project remains as Moderate. However, the
       following are key areas that need management attention and follow up:
                 Improve the current disbursement trends- i.e. from IDA to the Project, by
                    sending withdrawal applications with SOEs and necessary documentation as
                    appropriate at least once per month to avoid the Designated Account being
                    inactive.
                 Internal audit units should be requested to submit their reports on the reviews
                    they conducted on the project so that the project can follow up on the
                    findings and donors could see the weaknesses noted.

Project management support / TAD:
   - The five project management support missions (July 2010 – January 2011, five days
        each) provided by an international consultant team funded by the Bank assisted the PMT
        in up-dating and refining project management tools as well as finalizing the bidding
        document for disposal of obsolete pesticides. The mission noted however that the PMT
        would benefit from additional technical and management support. A discussion with CLI
        resulted in a general agreement that CLI would fund a Technical Advisor for Disposal
        (TAD) for the remaining project implementation period to focus on the disposal process
        and compliance monitoring issues. ToRs as well as CVs from existing TADs from other
        ASP countries were shared and will be revised before a formal request for direct funding
        and contracting will be sent to CLI.

Steering Committee:
    - The mission urged the PMT to organize the overdue Steering Committee meeting to
       present the restructured ASP project and request for approval of the final fifteen month
       work plan and procurement. This is expected to enhance project ownership, support and
       monitoring by GoE.

Reporting and Monitoring:
   - The mission reviewed the revised results framework in order to report on progress made
       and found that some of the targets had to be refined. The mission notified the PMT that
       the next progress report should follow the restructuring results framework (see annex 4).

A comprehensive list of all agreed actions over the next 6 months are in Annex 1. In addition
close follow-up will be maintained by the field based Team Lead for the project.

Next Mission. It was agreed that the next mission would tentatively be held in March 2012.

Executive Summary
A financial management review mission was conducted for the above mentioned project
September 29, 2011. The main objective of the mission was to review the project
financial management arrangements whether they continue to be adequate as designed to
give timely reports which reflect project transactions and whether such reports can
reliably be used for project monitoring and to review the action taken by the PMT with


                                                    11

regards to the action plan of last supervision mission. The FM team made its review at
project coordinating unit (PCU) of MOA.
The review focused on assessing the status and adequacy of the project’s financial
management arrangements and compliance with the legal covenants related to financial
management. Some of the aspects considered in this review include budgeting
accounting, internal control, financial reporting, fund flow management and external
audit and selected sample transaction review at the PCU.
It is the conclusion of this assessment that there is reasonable adequacy that the FM
system provided the necessary reasonable assurance that Bank loan proceeds are being
used for the intended purposes. However, the following are key areas that need
management attention and follow up:
         Improve the current disbursement trends- i.e. from IDA to the Project, by sending
          Withdrawal applications with SOEs and necessary documentation as appropriate
          at least once per month to avoid the Designated Account being inactive.
      Internal audit units should be requested to submit their reports on the reviews they
          conducted on the project so that the project can follow up on the findings and
          donors could see the weaknesses noted.

ISR FM Rating
On the basis of the issues highlighted, the overall summary rating on the financial
management arrangements of the project is assessed as Satisfactory, which is an
improvement from the previous status of Moderately Satisfactory.
The main reasons underlining the decision made on the rating are the timeliness of the
financial reports and their quality, the audit report being unqualified with only one
weakness of internal control, prompt action on the audit finding and the variance analysis
being conducted on quarterly basis.
The submission of WAs is very discouraging. More than 60% of the budget will be
utilized once the two contracts of obsolete pesticide disposal and store construction are
finalized. Since both contracts are environment sensitive, the finalization of the contract
has so far taken more than a year. The project is advised to submit WAs on monthly basis
even if the amount involved is small.



FM Risk Rating
Following the findings of mission, the Bank team suggests to rate both the Inherent and
Control risks as Moderate as was the case in last mission. The total FM risk rating
therefore will remains as Moderate.

FM Review: Findings and Action Plan
     1. Budgeting
          The overall EFY 2004 annual budget of the project is prepared and submitted to MoFED
          for approval. The amount submitted is Br. 31,166,520. The budgets are prepared by
          component and sub-components which are submitted for approval. We also noted that
          the PCU prepares and analyses the project performance on a quarterly basis by sending
          quarterly progress report to its management and MOA. This report includes budget
          utilization and variance analysis. Efforts were also made to compare budgets with actual
          expenditures for the purposes of quarterly FMRs sent to the Bank as well. Therefore we
          are also satisfied that budget monitoring/control aspect are well addressed.

     2. Accounting

          The PCU uses adequate computerized accounting system called peach tree accounting
          software to process and journalize the financial transactions. We noted that
          transactions were posted to this system as of September 29, 2011.

          The PCU has a Finance and Administration officer for the project since November 5,
          2009. The officer has work experience in other Bank financed projects. The PCU has
          assigned/recruited an accounting clerk. It was noted that the Finance and
          Administration officer got training in November 2010 in Malawi Institute of

                                                13

          Management as was organized by the World Bank. We are pleased to observe that files
          of the project are properly and separately kept.



     3. Internal Controls

          Normal government internal control procedures are in place for the project. In addition
          to this, the FM manual covers a wide range of internal control procedures.

          The authorized signatories approve payment vouchers and related documents before
          payments are processed. In addition, adequate segregation of duties has been
          maintained. There is satisfactory property management and related internal controls.

          Bank reconciliations are prepared on a monthly basis. The latest reconciliation is for the
          month ended August 06, 2011.

          The internal audit department of MoA has reviewed the documents of the project in
          May 2011. Although they have finalized their work, they have not yet issued their final
          report. We recommend that the project team should follow up with the internal audit
          department to obtain the report. The same should be shared with the Bank as soon as
          received.


     4. Funds Flow

          The mission noted that there were serious delays or lags in disbursement. Since the
          project became effective, out of the USD 2.6 million agreed financing, so far only 24%
          (USD 628,745.47) has been disbursed to the project, out of which USD 250,000 is an
          advance to the designated account. The submission of WA from the project is
          unsatisfactory. Only one withdrawal application was sent from January 2011 to date.

          The mission was informed that the main reasons that contributed to the lag in
          disbursement is the delays in implementation of the project including lag in
          procurement process that takes too much time to finalize some of the big
          procurements. The restructuring the project has been finalized which is expected to
          enhance the implementation of the project. The project should continue to submit WAs
          frequently so as to avoid the designated account being inactive.

          The Table below depicts the allocated budget versus the disbursement made for the
          project so far. The allocation table will change based on the restructuring document.

     5. Financial Reporting

          The project has submitted FMRs that were reviewed by the Bank’s FMS. We observed
          that there are no reportable weaknesses in the FMRs. The timeliness of the reports have
          been significantly improved. We would like to remind the project team that the FMR for
          the next quarter ending on October 10, 2011 needs to be submitted to the Bank before
          November 22, 2011.



     6. External Audit.


          The project has submitted the audit report for the year ended July 7, 2010. The audit
          report was submitted to the Bank with some delay. The auditors’ certificate contained
          unqualified (clean) opinions on the financial statements of the project. The
          management letter, which is part of the audit report only reported the failure to stamp
          payments with “PAID? rubber stamp to avoid duplication of payments and they
          recommended the use of such a stamp. The Project accepted this recommendation and
          has started using the stamp. Sample transactions were seen to verify this.

                                                15

          The project accounts for the FY ended July 7, 2011 has been prepared and finalized. The
          project has prepared RVP for inviting auditors acceptable to the Bank. we would like to
          remind the team that the audit report of the mentioned period needs to be submitted
          to the Bank before January 7, 2012.

     7. Counter -part Funding

          The Borrower’s contribution to the project has continued to flow through appointment
          of staff to the project and the payment of staff salaries and benefits (pension, medical
          bills), payment of utilities (including communication services (facsimile, internet, and
          telephone), water and electricity. The values/costs of these contributions were not
          quantified and reported in reports including the FMRs. It is as such recommendation for
          the project that the values of these in kind contributions be reflected in reports.

Annex 3: Procurement Review

The procurement management of the African Stockpiles Project was reviewed as part of the joint
supervision and implementation support mission of the Ethiopia Africa Stockpiles Project
(GEF TF090543-ET) from September 26-30, 2011. The mission had a discussion with the
project staff on the status of implementation of the procurement aspect of the project. The
implementation status of the project for all procurement packages was also reviewed with the
team. The procurement management of the project is found to be unsatisfactory.

Under the updated procurement plan the project has planned for the procurement of goods, works
and consulting services. The status of the implementation of the planned procurement was
reviewed and the findings are provided as follows.

Procurement of Goods: In the updated procurement plan the project has planned to undertake
the procurement of packages of goods which include the supply of safeguarding equipment and
disposal of pesticides, procurement of shredder for plastic pesticide containers, and printing of
outreach materials. Of these the most important packages are the safeguarding equipment and the
disposal of pesticides and disposal equipment (plastic shredders). These purchases could not be
moved since the CESA is not cleared. The draft bidding document for this particular
procurement package was received in March 2011. Although comments on the draft bidding
document were given by the procurement unit of the country office at the beginning of April 2011
no action has been taken on the draft bidding document for the safeguarding and disposal of
obsolete pesticides. Although this is the core activity under the project there appears to be no
action being taken by all concerned to clear the CESA and to move the procurement process of
the safeguarding and disposal of the obsolete pesticides.

The mission strongly recommends that appropriate actions should be taken by all concerned
bodies to expedite the procurement processes of the safeguarding and disposal of pesticides
which is important for the attainment of the development objectives of the project. Moreover, it
should be noted that unless appropriate measure is taken immediately the project is unlikely to
complete the disposal of the obsolete pesticides during the lifetime of the project.

Works: In the updated procurement plan there is only one package of works, i.e., the
construction of a pesticide store. The procurement processes of the pesticide store could not
proceed since it is expected that the design work should incorporate the findings from the
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Study (ESIA). This is another critical procurement
component of the project and more so which requires more time for completion. Unless the
procurement process for the construction of pesticide store is given appropriate attention, the
design review, the procurement process for the construction work, and the construction work
itself are not likely to be completed within the lifetime of the project.

Thus the Mission strongly recommends that appropriate actions should be taken to finalize the
ESIA, and to expedite the design review and the procurement process for the construction of the
pesticide store if the construction is to be completed within the life time of the project.

Consultancy Services: There are about twelve consultancy assignments planned in the updated
procurement plan of the project. Of these PSMS data entry and validation, preparation of CESA,
army worm control and strategy, and hiring of communication consultant to develop outreach
materials are reported to have been completed. Moreover, the selection and employment of
project staff is reported to have been completed except for the procurement staff of the project.
However, the process for the selection of other consultancy services is not initiated as yet. The

                                               19

initiation of some of the consultancy assignments, the survey of contaminated containers and
selection of appropriate technology is awaiting the completion approval of the ESIA.

The procurement processes for the consultancy assignments which are provided in the updated
procurement plan have been stalled for the past couple of years or so. The Mission strongly
recommends that some of the issues which are hindering the initiation of the procurement
processes including the completion of ESIA be resolved and actions taken to initiate and finalize
the procurement processes of the planned consultancy services.

Employment of a procurement officer for the project: The absence of a procurement staff is
one of the reasons for the delay in the implementation of the procurement aspect of the project.
Given the limited time remaining and a number of procurement activities to be completed the
availability of a procurement proficient staff in the project is very critical for the completion of
most of the remaining activities of the project. If the employment of a procurement staff is not
feasible alternative options for expediting the procurement process have to be sought given the
amount of procurement activity to be carried out during the remaining life time of the project.

Prior Review Thresholds: Upon the review of the prior review thresholds in the Africa Region
all Task Teams were advised to make an amendment to the legal agreement to reflect the change
in prior review thresholds for Goods, Works and Consultancy Services. It has now been noted
that such an amendment to the legal agreement of the African Stockpiles Project might have not
been made for the Ethiopia ASP Project. Under such circumstances the Mission recommends
that either the Task Team Leader should make an arrangement for an amendment to the legal
agreement or the prior review thresholds which are provided in the financing agreement of the
initial project shall apply.

Conclusion:

The planned procurement of goods, works and services under the project have not moving to
date. This is by and large attributed to the completion of two important studies viz. CESA and
ESIA. Since these studies have not been completed the procurement of the most critical
components of the project has been at a standstill since the effectiveness of the project.

The procurement of safeguarding equipment and disposal of pesticides, the construction of
pesticide stores, and other critical consultancy services could not be initiated at all since the
foregoing studies are not finalized and cleared by the Bank. The mission strongly recommends
that the CESA and ESIA should be finalized, cleared by the Bank and give way to the initiation
of the procurement processes of goods, works and consultancy services provided under the
project.
