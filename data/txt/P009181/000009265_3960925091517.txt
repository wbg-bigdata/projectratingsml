EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The project was the first integrated rural development project in
Yugoslavia which evolved from a number of studies of the project area carried
out by the UNDP from 1972 throdgh 1974.
Objectives
The main objectives of the project, appraised in December 1977 and
effective in January 1979, were to: (i) assist in the development of the BK
Region by financing investments in agriculture and agroindustries; (ii)
increase the productivity and income of the rural population; and (iii)
increase production of meat, milk, foodgrains, and processed food products
primarily for the domestic market.
Proiect Description
The main components of the project included: (i) provision of credit
to about 12,000 farmers for expansion of agricultural production; (ii)
,rovision of credit to the social sector for the establishment and/or
expansion of complementary support services to farmers; (iii) provision of
credit for land reclamation, irrigation and drainage for about 10,000 ha; and
(iv) establishment and/or expansion of agroindustries to process various
agricultural raw materials.
Implementation Experience
Inadequate capacity of PBS to appraise subprojects submitted by AIPK,
resulted initially in implementation delays of about two years by 1981 and the
project was scaled down. While design changes, Cost overruns and procurement
problems in agroindustries delayed implementation by a total of about three
years, project works were successfully completed by December 1985.
The final cost of the project exceeded the appraisal estimate of
Dinars 3,668 M by 388% in Dinar terms but was about 202 lower in US$ terms
mainly because of the initial two-year delay, substantially higher domestic
and lower-than-expected foreign inflation. About 40% of the loan proceeds
were invested in the individual sector and support services compared to 60%
anticipated at appraisal. The savings were used to cover financing of local
costs in agroindustries.



(v)
Results
Most of the individual farm production investments were successful
and most support services for private farmers were well utilized. However,
the capacity utilization ari  profitability of agroindustries has been
seriously threatened by technical delays in construction, cost overruns, sharp
input price increases, uncertainty of raw material supplieF, increased
processing and packaging costs and marketing problems.
Sustainability
Preliminary results indicate that increases in primary production due
to the project would be sustainable with the exception of fruit and
vegetables. The demand for some support services hy the farmers may not
develop to the extent anticipated at appraisal casting doubts on their
sustainability. Results from land improvement investments indicate that while
land reclamation and drainage exceeded appraisal targets, irrigation has been
disappointing. Results from agroindustries indicate that while most
facilities were well designed, equipped and with good potential to be
efficiently run from a technical point of v'!w, revenues do not in general
cover full costs of production and management faces difficult financial and
marketing problems.
Findings and Lessons Learned
Although the objectives of the project were to produce primarily for
the domestic market, reorientation toward exports is now needed due to a
contraction of domestic consumer demand.  However, a number of issues such as
availability of raw materials, better management and more effective marketing
would have to be first resolved to expand exports.  While conceptually and
technically sound, the project appeared oversized and too complex for AIPK and
PBS. This was reflected in the long period required prior to construction
starts ^f agroindustries and in the need to encourage individual farmers to
undertake on-farm investments.
While many of the lessons from this project may be valid only in the
context of Yugoslavia, the following comments should be taken into account in
the formulation of future projects:
(a) More careful assessment of the executing agency to implement the
project within the agreed time should have been undertaken.
(b) More time should have been allowed to complete the technical
documentation and financial appraisal prior to procurement
including demand assessment for new products.
(c) More vigorous follow-up by the borrower prior to approval of
requests for financing by subborrowers should have been required
to ensure: (i) adequate supply of raw materials; (ii) realistic
projections of market demand and prices; (iii) realistic
estimates of future financial viability.
(d)  More PBS attention and e rlier involvement nf the agricultural
extension service could have accelerated th,. growth of primary
production.

Project Completicn Report
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Yugoslav EconomY.  Despite an impressive record of economic and
social development since World War II, Yugoslavia has been facing a difficult
economic situation since the 1979 oil price shock.  Inflation has increased
from 20% in 1979 to 90% in 1986, agricultural and industrial production has
declined, merchandise exports have dropped and foreign debt has grown
steeply. The value of the Dinar, which remained stable since 1971 at about
US$1 = 18 Dinars through 1979, fell rapidly to US$1 = 500 Dinars in April
1987. To face the situation, the Government introduced in 1982 restrictive
monetary and fiscal policies, and various other measures to promote exports,
curb imports, and strengthen the social sector.
1.02     Agricultural Sector in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The Socialist Republic of
Bosnia-Herzegovina (SRBH) is one of the less developed republics. Its per
capita income amounts to about two thirds of the Yugoslav average. While
employment in agriculture declined from 48% (1975) to less than 20% (1985),
production grew at about 1.4% annually. However, SRBH agricultural
productivity remains low compared to Yugoslav averages.
1.03     Two main reasons account for SRBH's low agricultural productivity:
(i) difficult, predominantly mountainous terrain with the exception of the
Pannonian plains on the south bank of the Sava River; and (ii) low efficiency
of the individual sector which holds 95% of cuiltivated land and 90% of the
livestock population, but in terms of yields per hectare or per animal for
major products is about 25-30% below Yugoslav averages and about 50% below the
yields of the SRBH's social sector.
1.04     Bank's Involvement in Yugoslavia.  By September 1978 the Bank had
made 53 loans to Yugoslavia totalling about US$2,063 M comprising US$ 867 M in
17 loans for infrastruc.ure projects, US$ 288 M in six loans for agriculture
and agroindustries projects, and US$ 908 M in 17 loans for industry, pollution
control and tourism.
1). PROJECT PROCESSING
2.01     Project Setting.  The Bosanska Krajina (BK) Region with a total
population of 850,000 (1980) is located in the western part of SRBH, with the
Sava River flowing at its northern boundary (Map No. IBRD 13592R and 13593R).
The project area consists of 18 communes covering a total of about 1.2 M ha or
24% of SRBH. The main town in the project area is Banja Luka with poptulation
of 200,000.
2.02     The climate is moderate with highest temperatures (21°C) in July
and total rainfall 900 mm/year in the North to 1,300 mm/year in the South



-2-
enabling most crops to perform well without irrigation. However, because of
rainfall deficits of up to 400mm in the summer months, double cropping is
possible only with irrigation. In the North, poor drainage conditions limit
crop production on about 50,000 ha. Most soils are moderately heavy in
texture and mainly acidic with reasonable waterholding capacity.
2.03     Project Origin.  The project evolved from a number of studies c-rried
out under the UNDP/Yugoslav financed regional plannin6 project, 1972-74 (UNDP
project)."' The UNDP project prepared a development strategy for the
project area focussed on promoting increases in farm production, mainly in the
individual sector, in parallel with increases in processing capacities and an
expansion of marketing opportunities. To implement this development strategy,
an agroindustrial kombinat AIPK was established 2', in 1974, to be
responsible for integrated rural development of the BK Region. In its
Five-Year Development Plan (1976-80), AIPK adopted the development strategy
and many of the targets proposed in the UNDP project; the project was an
integral part of tiis Plan.
2.04     Identification and Preparation.  AIPK prepared the project with the
assistance of FAO/IBRD Corporative Program staff, which included experts in
milk and meat processing, land development, fruit, vegetable and potato
processing. The project preparation report, issued in October 1977, formed
the basis for appraisal if the project, which was carried out in December 1977.
2.05     Appraisal.  Main issues during project appraisal related to project
size and scope, the loan amount, retroactive financing and procurement. The
mission recommended to include a land reclamation component but to delete five
agroindustry components which were not adequately prepared or did not appear
financially viable. As the Bank's funds available for the project were not
sufficient to cover the foreign exchange cost, the missi-n recommended
cofinancing or raising additional local funds (para 3.25). The mission also
recommended retroactive financing for some of the project preparation
activities and equipment. Finally, the mission could not endorse PBS request
to waive ICB procurement in favor of local procedures. All recommendations by
the appraisal mission were endorsed by the Bank's management.
2.06     Newotiations.  Negotiations started on July 10, 1978 and were
completed on July 20, 1978. Th- main issues were the on-lending interest rate
and the work program for agricultural extension. Concerning the interest
rate, the Yugoslav delegation objected to the policy of the Bank to determine
interest on funds on-lent by the Borrower from proceeds of the Bank loan as
well as for local funds on-lent under the project. However, the Yugoslav
delegation accepted the Bank's proposals that: (i) interest rate for
on-lending of the Bank loan be 112; (ii) interest rate on domestic resources
loaned under the project to the social sector subborrowers at 6Z and to
11       UNDP Project "Development of an Agroindustrial Food Complex in the BK
Region" (UNDP/FAO/YUG 71/514): Consolidated Plan.
2/       Agroindustrijeski i Prometni Kombinat (AIPK) was formed as an
umbrella organization for some 78 previously independent Basic
Organizations of Associated Labor (BOAL).



individual farmers through Zadrugas'' be at least 5%.  This rate structure
was to provide PBS with a spread of about 3.1X on the proceeds of the Bank
loan and 1.2% on the local funds portion of the subloans and was to cover
administrative costs of Privredna Banka Sarajevo (PBS), the borrower.
2.07     Board Presentation and Effectiveness.  The Board approved a loan of
US$55 million on October 5, 1978 subject to three conditions of effectiveness
and the loan documents were signed on November 6, 1978. The conditions of
effectiveness included: (i) establishment of a Project Unit (PU) within AIPK;
(ii) preparation of a detailed work program for the establishment of adequate
extension service for individual farmers in the project area by AIPK; and
(iii) ratification of the Project Agreement by AIPK. These conditions were
fulfilled and the Loan was declared effective on March 28, 1979.
2.08     Proiect Objectives.  The main objectives of the project were to:  (i)
assist in the development of the BK Region by financing investments in
agriculture and agroindustries; (ii) increase the productivity and income of
the rural population; and (iii) increase production of meat, milk, foodgrains,
and processed food products primarily for the domestic market. The project
was also to help AIPK and the Privredna Banka Sarajevo (PBS) through provision
of technical assistance and training of staff. The project objectives to
promote development of the least developed areas, and in particular, to
increase productivity of private farmers were consistent with the development
strategy of the Government and Bank in Yugoslavia.
2.09     Project Description.  The project was to include the following
components:
(a) Individual Farm Production. Provision of credit through 23
Zadrugas to about 12,000 individual farmers for the construction
of buildings, machinery, equipment, animal breeding stock,
planting material, packing and storage sheds, sprinklers and
other supplies to increase crop and livestock production.
(b) Support Services. Provision of credit to the social sector for
the establishment and/or expansion of complementary support
services to farmers such as Heifer Rearing Farm, Pig Breeding
Farm, Cattle Breeding and Progeny Testing, Sheep Research Farm,
Seed Processing Plants, Technical Support Unit for specialised
technical assistance to Zadruga extension workers, Fruit Tree
Nursery and Farm Machinery Workshop.
1/       The Zadruga is a Working Organization of Associated Labor (WO) and
part of a kombinat. It may comprise of two or more Basic Cooperative
Organizations established among individual farmers. Zadrugas are set
up under provisions of Law on Associated Labor. In this report the
term Zadruga also refers to basic organization of contract farmers
(BOC) which is another form of association of individual farmers.
The main difference between a Zadruga and a social sector
organization is that the resources of the Zadruga are pooled by its
members (individual farmers) who retain the right of ownership over
pooled resources, whereas the resources of a social sector
organization are property of society and its workers are vested with
a right to use and dispose of the product, and to manage means of
production.



-4-
(c)  Land Reclamation, Irrigation and Drainage.  Provision of credit
for land development, reclamation and drainage of about 8,300 ha
and 1,500 ha in the social and individual sectors respectively.
Also included was a sprinkler irrigation systerm for 1,20' ha in
the social sector and farm machinery and equipment to cultivate
reclaimed land.
(d)  Agroindustries.  Establishment and/or expansion of
agroindustries to process increased crop and livestock
production including Milk and Meat Processing Plants; Poultry
Processing Plant; Meat Rendering Plant; Maltery; Fruit,
Vegetable and Potato Processing Plants; and Plum Processing
Plant.
From the total project cost of about US$ 204 M the individual farm production
accounted for about 401, support services for about 107, land reclamation for
10X, and agroindustries for 40%.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01     Start-up.  Prior to loan effectiveness in January 1979 the Project
Unit (PU) was established and its Director appointed. This was followed by
the recruitment of marketing and procurement specialists and international
consultants for the preparation of designs and tender documents of the
agroindustry subprojects. Delays occurred in recruiting a consultant to set
up a project monitoring and evaluation system.
3.02     Project lending policies and procedures (Annex 3, SAR) required PBS
to appraise each of the social sector subprojects submitted from the Zadrugas
and BOALs through the PU of AIPK and to prepare an appraisal report prior to
each subloan approval. However, PBS had difficulty in processing the large
number of preparation reports submitted by PU, and the physical implementation
of most subprojects started one or two years behind the appraisal
implementation schedule. Staffing in numbers as well as quality fell short of
appraisal requirements during the first year of implementation. Preparation
of feasibility studies, detailed designs and tender documents for the
procurement of equipment experienced delays compared to appraisal
implementation schedule already by early 1980 and of the 75 subprojects
submitted to PBS, only 45 had been approved and eleven submitted to the Bank.
In addition, attempts by PU to work simultaneously on almost all subprojects
resulted in delays of up to five months before their submission to PBS.
3.03     Revisions of Project Scope.  With implementation delayed by about two
years in early 1981 and with further delays expected because of inadequate
local cost financing and cost overruns, the Bank requested PBS to prepare a
revised project implementation schedule and financing plan and to scale down,
defer or delete some investments. The amended May 1982 Project Agreement
deleted the Heifer Rearing Farm, the Sheep Research Farm, and the Maltery from
the project. The Bank agreed to modify the original plan to expand and
modernize the existing IMPRO slaughterhouse in favor of a new plant as
recommended by AIPK and the Commune of Prijedor. In addition, the Bank agreed
to conceptual changes and expansion of storage and processing capacities of
the milk processing plant in Banja Luka.
3.04     The Loan Agreement was also amended on several other occasions to
enable the Bank to: (i) increase the disbursement percentages for local
expenditures due to Dinar devaluations; (ii) reallocate loan proceeds from



I                             -    5   --
primary production components to agroindustries; and (iii) to enable AIPK to
expand its dairy and heifer breeding farms in Nova Topola with the purchase of
400 units of breeding stock.
I
Physical Implbmentation
3.05     General.  Design changes, cost overruns and procurement problems
particularly in agroindustries, delayed implementation considerably. However,
the overall project works were successfully completed by December 1985, three
years later than originally planned.
3.06     Individual Farm Production.  The process of identification, technical
and financial reporting and approval of subloans by PBS and Basic Banks took
much longer than anticipated at appraisal. Less than 10% of the individual
farms subprojects were under construction and not a single subloan for
vegetable farms had been approved by April 1981.
3.07     One major unforeseen bottleneck was the time required by Commune
administrations to clear land titles before loans could be approved.
Following a request by AIPK, the individual farm production program was
reduced on the ground that farmers' demand for credit was less than expected
due to the inflow of savings from BK workers employed abroad.
3.08     The number of approved subprojects increased considerably later on
through the efforts of the project coordinating teams and by the end of 1985
the number of subloans for livestock production had almost reached the
appraisal target. However, less than two-thirds of planned vegetable farms
received financing and the average loan size was much smaller (in constant
terms) than the appraisal target. The results for the individual farm
production component are surmarized below.

3.09     As part of the individual farm production component four out of five
planned grain drying and storage sites, and eighteen general purpose storage
units (13,550m2) were constructed. Farm machinery such as tractors, co)mbine
harvestors and farm implements were distributed to farmers on credit through
Zadrugas.'
3.10     Support Services.  Except for the Heifer Rearing and Sheep Research
farms, which were deleted from the project (para 3.03) all support services
contemplated under the project were implemented. The Pig Breeding Farm, Seed
Processing Plant and Fruit Tree Nursery became operational by 1982. The Bank
also approved the importation of 55 units of breeding stock for the Cattle
Breeding Farm in 1984 afLer initial delays due to cost overruns and management
changes. The strengthening of the Regional Extension Service started in 1980
was completed in 1983.
3.11     Land Reclamation, Irrigation and Drainage.  PBS approved the first
two subprojects, the Bosanska Dubica land improvement project (4,500 ha) and
the Nova Topola irrigation project (1,200 ha), in July 1979. Subsequently,
the Nova Topola drainage project (2,750 ha) was approved followed by two other
drainage projects: Srbac (1,237 ha) and Prnjavor (1,260 ha). Difficulties
were reported in finding suitable local consulting firms to prepare
feasibility studies. Irrigation works were initially delayed due to changes
in final designs needed to reduce subproject costs but works were largely
completed by 1982 except for about 1,500 ha in Bosanska Dubica and a small
area in Srbac. Thus while construction was delayed by one to two years,
implementation generally conformed to schedule or went faster than
contemplated once started. Of the 9,700 ha to be reclaimed or drained 8,870
ha or 90% had been completed.
Agroindustries
3.12     Milk Processing Plant Expansion - Bania Luka.  Technical documents
were submitted by AIPK to PBS for appraisal in October 1979. At the time of
tender preparation in September 1980, cost estimates had reached Dinars 440 M
compared to appraisal estimate of Dinars 180 M due to Dinar inflation and
devaluation, and inzreased processing and storage capacities. While the Bank
approved this subproject in September 1980, the first of over 40 contracts for
the delivery of milk processing equipment was signed only in June 1982. Due
to delays in bidding evaluation and difficulties in completing the financing
plan, construction started soon after the civil works con. sct was signed only
in March 1983. However, important equipment remained in customs as duties had
not been paid for months. As a result of these and other constraints, the new
dairy plant has lost several years of operation.
l
3.13     Meat Processinig Plant (IMPRO) - Prijedor.  The PBS appraisal plan to
reconstruct the IMPRO slaughterhouse was changed late in 1979 in favor of a
new plant and as a result in March 1981, cost estimates increased to Dinars
300 M compared to Dinars 56 M planned for old plant rehabilitation. While the
Bank supervision mission strongly urged to delete the subproject, it agreed in
response to continued AIPK requests to proceed with a detailed feasibility
study, an appraisal report and preparation of tender documents. During bid
evaluation in September 1982, revised costs reached Dinars 670 M. While the
Bank again expressed strong reservations to the planned design capacity (4.5
times of the old plant) and the uncertainty of raw material supply it finally
approved the subproject in October 1982 based on additional information and
studies. Contracts for civil works and imported equipment were signed in



May 1983 and the plant was completed in early 1985, followed by trial
operations and regular production assisted by consultants in 1986.
3.14     PRO1jEINKA - Bosanska Gradiska.  The PBS appraisal included
slaughterhouse modernization and expansion, meat processing and ready-food
preparation line of 10,000 meals per day capacity. Designs and tender
documents were prepared by foreign consultants appointed in 1979. A major
delay occurred when AIPK found final designs in conflict with Yugoslav
regulations. The revised designs and the preparation of 27 construction
contracts also required more time than anticipated. Civil works started in
late 1982 but delays reoccurred due to late downpayments and problems of
coordinating the large number of suppliers. Most of the equipment from a
Dutch supplier had arrived on site prior to completion of civil works by the
end of 1983 and its installation started only in the fall of 1984.  Although
limited scale production continued during plant rehabilitation and
modernization (1983-85), trial production of new facilities started only in
June 1985.  At the time of the PCR mission, federal inspectors were at the
plant to decide on awarding meat export license, which is essential for the
plant's profitability. However, export to EEC countries will only be allowed
after further inspection by EEC officials, which was expected by May 1987.
The complete ready-food line has also been installed but to become operational
requires four to five months of foreign expert assistance to run trial
operations and train local staff.
3.15     Poultry Slaughterhouse - Srbac.  The PBS appraisal for a turnkey
poultry slaughterhouse was approved by the Bank in November 1979. Tendering
took place in the summer of 1980 and the contract with a Swiss company was
finalized for Dinar 480 M on September 1981. The Bank had requested PBS to
reassess the financial viability of the investment to ensure that sufficient
financing was available to cover the contract price, permanent working capital
and interest during construction. Based on additional information and studies
site preparation started in September 1981 and construction was completed by
September 1982 followed by pilot production in April 1984.
3.16     Plum Products and Dried Fruit - Prijedorcanka.  The PBS appraisal
included the expansion of distilling operations of plum brandy and new
facilities for industrial processing of 1,200 tons of dried fruit, mainly
plums. The Bank approved the subproject in November 1979 and tender documents
in February 1980. During the bid evaluation in the summer of 1980, the Bank
requested PBS to reassess the financial viability of the subproject in view of
the substantially increased investment costs. Based on additional information
and studies construction of a new factory building started at the end of 1980
and was completed by 1985. Five complete fruit drying units installed in 1982
started production in 1984 but other equipment for drying of apples, pears and
apricots was not installed due to foreign exchange shortage.
3.17     Potato Processing and Storage Plant - Glomoc.  The PBS appraisal for
a new potato processing plant near Glomoc included storage of 12,000 tons
(2,000 tons of seed potatoes) and equipment to produce washed, graded and
packed fresh potatoes, french fries, potato salad and croquettes. The
subproject was approved by PBS in early 1979 and thereafter by the Bank and
implemented in two contracts; first with a Swiss engineering and contracting
company approved in November 1980 and second with a local civil construction
firm approved in September 1980. The scope of works had changed from the
original appraisal with more complex civil works, processing lines of higher



i                                 - 8 -
capacities, an additional flow freezer and by switching from oil heated to
coal operated steam boiler, all of which led to higher cost. Most of the
installation work was completed by March 1983 and pilot operations started one
year and a half behind schedule in January 1984.
l
3.18     Fruit Juice Factory.  The PBS appraisal included a new fruit juice
factory as a joinit venture of two older plants in Banja Luka (Bosanska and
Vitaminka), at a site adjacent to the Vitaminka. Existing equipment from both
processing plants was to be installed in the new factory to produce thick
juices, clear juices, concentrates and frozen fruit pulp. A new more
diversified project concept was prepared in September 1980 including packing
and a line of carbonated fruit juices. As some essential equipment had not
been included during project preparation, revised cost estimates rose to
Dinars 597 M compared to the appraisal estimate of Dinars 244 M. The Bank
suggested to PBS to: (i) reassess the adequacy of raw material supply and
market prospects tor the expanded investment; (ii) review the availability of
funds; (iii) and reassess the financial viability of the joint venture. The
revised appraisal report and draft tender documents submitted to PBS raised
concern about mnarketing 2,000 tons of frozen pulp and 700 tons of juice
concentrate annually and recommended that AIPK engage an international export
specialist to review the marketing aspects of the project. After additional
review of ptiduct marketing, ten contracts were signed for supply of equipment
and civil works in July 1982 and by September 1983 all imported equipment had
been delivered and pulp freezing and fruit juice concentrate lines had been
installed and test operated.
3.19     Vitaminka Expansion - Banja Luka.  The PBS appraisal included
production of baby foods, jams, mushrooms, compotes and purees. The designs
completed in September 1980 resulted in cost estimates 64% higher than at Bank
appraisal. Of the ten contracts (eight with foreign suppliers), only six had
been negotiated by September 1981, mainly because foreign exchange loans were
hard to obtain in view of the small number of suppliers, and amounts
involved. Most of the equipment was delivered in May/June 1982 and by
September 1983 various processing lines were in operation but at limited
capacity.
3.20     Quality of Project Works.  The quality of physical project works has
been generally satisfactory. The civil works are of good quality and above
average design, and the processing equipment is sophisticated and of high
quality.
3.21     Procutement.  The proeurement procedures stipulated in the Loan
Agreement comprised ICB for agroindustries equipment, planting material and
harvesting machinery for crop production.  The civil works and other
agricultural machinery were to be procured in accordance with LCB procedures
acceptable to the Bank. Apart from delays, the procurement of equipment and
works was undertaken in accordance with the Loan Agreement.  AIPK retained the
services of foreign consultants to prepare designs and bidding documents for
agroindustries. The Srbac poultry slaughterhouse and the rendering plant were
built under ICB turnkey contracts.
3.22     Project Cost.  The total project cost was 388S higher in Dinar terms
than estimated at appraisal, but 20% lower in US$ terms (Table 1-2). The main
reason for the Dinar cost overrun was that many components were carried out
two to three years later than anticipated and that inflation during project
implementation was far higher than projected at appraisal. The Dinar was
devalued by about 1,500Z between 1979 and 1985.



- 9 -
3.23     Actual costs expressed in US$ terms for crop and livestock
production, land reclamation and support services were 40-55% below appraisal
estimates. The total investment in agroindustries exceeded the appraisal
estimate by only 4% because the Livno maltery was not constructed and
appraisal cost estimates for;agroindustries expressed in Dinars and converted
into US$ included price contingencies for foreign costs exceeding considerably
actual international inflation during implementation. However, the largest
cost overruns occurred in the agroindustries.
3.24     The total investment in the individual sector amounted to 36% of the
cost compared to the anpraisal target of 40%. In terms of the Bank loan only
about 40% of the loan -roceeds were invested in the individual sector,
compared to 60% at appraisal (Tables 3-4). The Bank loan savings in primary
agricultural production and support services were used to finance local costs
and were partly diverted from individual sector activities to the
agroindustries (para 3.04). Only about 30% of actual expenditure was incurred
between 1979 and mid-1983 compared with the appraisal estimate that by
mid-1983 the project would be essentially completed as indicated below:
1979    1980      1981     1982      1983     1984      1985  mid 1986
Appraisal    3%       39%       72       98%      100%        -         -        -
Actual        -        1%       4%       22%       36%      54%       67%    100%
3.25     Financing.  The financing plan excluding interest during construction
showed that AIPK would contribute 20% of the project costs, IBRD 85% of
foreign exchange costs or 27% of total project costs, and the remaining 53%
would be provided by PBS from its own sources, including cofinancing and funds
from the Republic and Federal services (Tables 3-4). The Loan Agreement
stipulated a minimum of 20% contribution to project costs from individual and
social sector subborrowers, the maintenance of at least 75% to 25% debt/equity
ratio by social sector subborrowers and sufficient cashflow to meet all
financial obligations. However, the Loan Agreement also permitted exceptions
to the stipulated requirements provided the subborrower entered into an
agreement with the Borrower or another Yugoslav bank to increase its equity
over a suitable period of time, to a level, determined in the course of
appraisal, to be not less than 25% of its capitalization. The cost overruns
experienced in agroindustry subprojects (Table 1) were finan-ed by resorting
to borrowing from Federal and Republic Funds, local banks and from the World
Bank. This lack of financial discipline and inadequate monitoring of
financial performance at the time of rapid inflation and Dinar devaluation
left many subborrowers in a precarious financial condition.
3.26     While the IBRD loan covered only 85% of the foreign exchange costs of
the project, PBS arranged a US$20 million cofinancing with foreign commercial
banks. However, due to long delays in disbursements and rapid inflation,
foreign exchange requirements were delayed and the cofinancing funds were used
by PBS in the SRBH energy sector. Suppliers' credit for agroindustries
amounted to only 2% of total'project costs (Table 4). Own funds in the
"narrow" sense amounted to only 12% of total financing. However, AIPK's PCR
estimate for agroindustries (Table 3) shows this 27%, which is due to
inclusion of Federal and Republic funds as equivalent to equity for financing
purposes.
3.27     Disbursements.  Throughout the project, disbursement lagged behind
appraisal estimates and at the original loan closing date only 51% was
disbursed. However, it should be noted that appraisal forecasts were



- 10 -
optimistic. Disbursements under the project surpassed by one and a half year
the disbursement profile of about six years for the Yugoslav agricultural
sector. Disbursements for agroindustries were slower than for other
components and had not reached even 10% three years after project
effectiveness, mainly because the appraisal forecast did not allow for the
design, contract and procurement phases. The loan closing date was extended
twice from June 30, 1983 to December 31, 1984 and then again to December 31,
1985 with final disbursement by July 31, 1986 at which undisbursed amount of
US$0.32 M was cancelled. Details are given in Table 5.
3.28     Compliance with Loan Covenants.  PBS and AIPK generally complied with
all covenants and the provisions of six side letters. The principal covenants
included: (i-) assigning additional staff to the PU in AIPK; (ii) engaging
consultants for various agroindustries; and (iii) engaging consultants for
designing a monitoring and evaluation system for the project by May 1, 1979.
Covenants requiring Quarterly Progress Reports and Audit Reports have been
complied with satisfactorily. Difficulties were only encountered in
maintaining separate Project Accounts in agroindustries with preproject
operations (Project Agreement 9.02).
IV. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT
Individual Farm Production
4.01     Incremental Crop and Livestock Production.  Information on
incremental production and yields remains incomplete due to the wide range of
subprojects financed and the limitations of the monitoring and evaluation
system. A revised estimate of the project's annual incremental production in
the individual sector is tased on AIPK's PCR, M&E reports and farm surveys
(Table 6). Systematic M&E farm surveys were abandoned after 1985.
4.02     Dairy Farms.  Investments in buildings was generally on target but
the number of heads per farm through acquisitions of in-calf heifers rose only
to seven in 1985 against the appraisal target of eight. The total milk
production per farm according to AIPK farm survey was about 22,000 liters
which was close to the appraisal target. However, of the total incremental
milk production from over 1,300 farms that received project funds only a small
share is being delivered to the Banja Luka Dairy Plant. High sales of calves
were reported and a number of dairy farmers are engaged in cattle fattening.
Such a mix of activities enables farmers to diversify their risks,
particularly in view of price uncertainties. Cattle prices (liveweight)
increased by about 450% compared to an increase of 222% for milk prices during
the 1980-83 period.
4.03     No comprehensive data were collected by AIPK on incremental milk and
meat production of participating farms. However, the difficulties encountered
by the Banja Luka dairy in increasing its milk collection from farm
cooperatives indicates that either the incremental milk production has been
lower than planned or a major part is consumed on the farm or sold directly to
consumers.
4.04     Calf and Pig Fattening.  About 500 farmers invested in facilities for
calf fattening each with a herd of 48 heads and average calf weight of 320 kg,
achieving appraisal targets. Pig fattening attracted about 30X less farmers
than anticipated at appraisal and the average number of sows was seven with
annual piglet production of 22 or 10% of the appraisal tLrget.



- 11 -
4.05     Poultry Farms.  About 50 farmers compared to appraisal target of 130
invested in broiler and egg farms with farm sizes considerably larger than
anticipated. Performance indicators, such as average weight and feed
conversion ratio reached appraisal target.
4.06     Sheep Farms.  More farmers invested in sheep with flocks almost twice
the size anticipated and annual meat and cheese production higher than
projected at appraisal.
4.07     Fruit Farms.  About 310 farmers invested in fruit farming and planted
on average 7.5 ha of fruit trees (appraisal target 7.7 ha) consisting of
apples (542), pears (262) and plums (10%). The remaining area (10%) was
planted with a variety of other fruit species. Total fruit production on
project farms was about 4,250 tons in 1985, which was substantially less than
projected at appraisal mainly due to a severe 1984/85 winter frost that
affected the entire BK Region.
4.08     Vegetable Farms.  About 300 farmers planted on average 2.0 ha with
vegetables in 1984 and 2.9 ha in 1985 compared to the appraisal target of 3.5
ha (mainly potatoes, cabbages and peppers). Yields recorded in 1985 were
below appraisal estimates except for potatoes. Total incremental production
of the vegetable farms estiwated at 14,400 tons has been substantially less
than anticipated at appraisal.
4.09     Storage and Drying Facilities.  The utilization of grain silos and
drying facilities by farmers has been poor (Table 7). Only 13% in 1985 and
3L2 in 1986 of the total capacity of 20,000 tons has been used over rather
short periods. Although the quantity of grain dried surged from 2,400 tons in
1985 to 9,700 tons in 1986, two of the four drying facilities remained
virtually unused during the same period. Use of the 13,500 m general
purpose flat storage was far better and averaged 21,000 tons during the
1984-86 period (an estimated 80% of capacity).
4.10     Farm Machinery.  The rate of utilization of major farm equipment
procured for cooperatives has been satisfactory and in accordance with project
appraisal estimates.
Support Services
4.11     Although the support services had been implemented as envisaged at
appraisal, farmers utilization of some of them did not reach appraisal
estimates. The Seed Processing Plant has reached only 50% capacity
utilization by 1986 and Fruit Tree Nursery produced only 96,000 seedlings in
1986 or 19% of capacity. The Cattle Breeding Farm was more successful
utilizing 95% of capacity and producing 378,000 AI doses annually. The Pig
Breeding Farm also operated near its capacity due to strong farmer demand. In
contrast, the utilization of machine workshops was below expectations and has
resulted in poor financial results.
Land Reclamation, Irrigation and Drainage
4.12     While the incremental crop production from the 8,870 ha (appraisal
target of 9,700 ha) reclaimed land generally exceeded appraisal targets, the
incremental crop production on the 1,200 ha irrigation scheme has been
disappointing and casts doubt on the sustainability and the justification for
further BK irrigation development.



- 12 -
Agroindustries
4.13     About 55Z of all project investments was undertaken in milk, meat,
fruit, and vegetable processing, all of which face common problems in recent
years including: (i) increased competition for scarce raw materials resulting
froim increases in raw material prices; (ii) increased disparity between output
and input prices evident in an extreme form in certain agroindustries; (iii)
steady decrease in purchasing power of the retail consumer market which
contributed to a decline in capacity utilization and sales (Table 8); (iv)
higher costs of produiction; (v) low export prices relative to domestic prices;
and (vi) lack of financial management. Therefore, while most facilities were
well designed, with good layout, equipment, and potential to be efficiently
run from a technical point of view, revenues do not in general cover the full
costs of production and management faces difficult financial and marketing
problems.
4.14     Milk Processing.  The PBS appraisal report estimated sufficient daily
raw milk supplies to be available to produce 48 M liters of milk, yoghurt and
cream and 1,600 tons of cheese in the BK Region by 1985. It was expected that
part of the incremental milk supply would come from the expansion of
production under the project. However, despite the participation of over
1,300 farmers in the .dairy development program, the industry has been facing a
very serious shortage of raw milk deliveries. The completed plant lacks milk
deliveries from the private sector to utilize its increased capacity because
private farmers are not interested in producing and delivering milk to the
industry at official farmgate prices. Therefore, increases in capacity
utilization will depend on higher producer prices.
4.15     Meat Processing.  Capacity utilization of the slaughterhouse during
the first year of operation (1985) reached about 57X. Fresh and processed
meat production increased substantially between its first year of operation
(1985) but reached about 50Z capacity in 1986. The ready-to-eat meal line
planned to produce 10,000 meals daily is not yet in operation. The rendering
plant is entirely dependent on its raw material supply from four
slaughterhouses and has not been able to reach full capacity. Utilization
rose parallel with meat production from 37% in 1985 to 60% in 1986. The
poultry slaughterhouse in operation since 1984 obtained export permits and
gradually increased its throughput to 3,800 tons or 66% capacity in 1986.
4.16     Potato Processing.  Production of processed potatoes started in early
1984 and reached about 500 tons or 332 of capacity. No rate of utilization is
available for the bagging and storage facility. The plant has had great
difficulties in marketing and exporting its products and AIPK has been in
cuntact with a fast-food chain to examine the possibility of a long-term
marketing arrangement.
4.17     Plum Products and Dried Fruit.  Production performance of this plant,
which started to operate initially on target by September 1982, has been
declining. Production of dried prunes dropped from 378 tons (322 of capacity)
in 1985 to 182 tons (15Z of capacity) in 1986. Likewise, the distillation of
plum brandy dropped from 395 tons in 1985 to 253 tons in 1986, 25Z utilization
of capacity. Sales for plum products have been declining on the domestic and
export markets and the plant has been in heavy competition with nine other
brandy producers. Project investments in the new plant at Prijedor were
scheduled at appraisal for the production of one million liters of plum brandy
and 1,200 tons of dried fruits.



- 13 -
4.18     Fruit and Vesetable Processing.  Production records do not clearly
distinguish between quantities processed in the new fruit juice factory and
the expansion of Vitaminka. About 7,600 tons of juices were produced in 1986
utili.ing 312 of capacity. Exports of fruit juices and other fruit products
amounted to 5,000 tons in 1982 but declined to 3,500 tons in 1983. During the
July 1984 supervision, it was observed that in order to fully utilize the new
fruit juice plant, exports would have to reach about 5,000 tons. However,
vegetable exports reached modest 330 tons in 1982, and then declined to 200
tons in 1983. In addition to preblems faced in export markets, Vitaminka also
faces raw material supply problems at home.
V. FINANCIAL RESULTS
Individual Farm Production
5.01     The financial rates of return (FRRs) have been reestimated for ma0or
types of investments in primary agricultural production and land reclamation
components financed under the project. Omission of minor project components
would not result in deviations from the estimated benefits of the project.
The FRRs based on actual investment and operating costs and benefits have been
recalculated by AIPK's M&E unit.  All costs and benefits have been expressed
in January 1987 constant prices.  The appraisal and PCR FRRs (before
financing) are compared below.

- 14 -
While the PCR FRRs of the dairy farms are close to the appraisal estimate, the
FRRs for the cattle fattening and pig breeding farms are considerably lower
due to the high cost of feed concentrate. The acute shortage of soyabean meal
and fishmeal caused by foreign exchange constraints led to shortages and
significant increases in the costs of high protein feed required in the case
of cattle fattening and pig breeding production. The larger than anticipated
broiler and egg farms are run efficiently and have a higher FRR. The sheep
farms, not so dependent on high protein feed, have also higher than
anticipated FRR.
Agroindustries
5.02     General.  Agroindustries' profitability has been seriously threatened
by sharp input price increases, technical delays in construction, cost
overruns, increased processing and packaging costs, uncertainty in raw
material supplies, marketing problems, limited domestic demand and low export
prices, all of which affect the financial situation of AIPK (Table 9).
5.03     Input Prices.  From the time of appraisal input prices have increased
15-30 fold together with a 26 fold increase of the consumer price index
(Table 10). For example, the farmgate price for milk of 4.5 Dinars/liter in
1978 increased to 140 Dinars/liter in early 1987. Beef for 26 Dinars/kg
liveweight in 1978 increased to 950 Dinars/kg in early 1987. Fruit and
vegetables also increased dramatically in price. However, most output prices
have increased less compared to input prices which may well be due to the
large growth in food processing capacity and upward pressure on demand for
fresh produce, downward pressure on prices of finished products from increased
supply and stagnant consumer demand. In addition, the costs of collecting and
processing of raw materials and the costs of energy and packaging also
increased.
5.04     Financial Performance.  Apart from their heavy debt burden, most
agroindustries operate in a much worse financial environment then foreseen at
appraisal. Most agroindustries make losses except the milk processing plant
and the fruit juice plant which broke even in 1986. The combined loss
amounted to Dinars 2,787 M (US$10.3 M) in 1985 and Dinars 2,403 K (US$6.3 M)
in 1986. These financial results would have been worse if provisions for
accrued interest, amortization and foreign exchange losses were made in
accordance with international accounting standards.- The balance sheets
and in'ome statements for 1985/86 and actual lending terms of the nine
agroindustries financed under the project are given in Tables 11-13.
5.05     The Bank made comprehensive recommendations to improve the
performance of the two meat processing plants, the fruit juice plant and the
plum processing plant in 1984. The Bank also advised that the potato
processing plant in Glomoc be closed due to insurmountable technical and raw
material supply problems. However, PBS did not show any active interest in
implementing the recommendations and in a subsequent visit to AIPK the Bank
learned that little has been done iti implementing its recommendations. The
managerial, marketing and technical shortcomings still continue.
1/ Yugoslav accounting practices differ from international accounting
standards. For example, interest on loans are accounted only when paid,
amortization is reduced to minimum levels disregarding economic rates and
foreign exchange losses are capitalized.



- 15 -
5.06     Financial Rates of Return.  The FRRs calculated in constant 1987
prices for all plants are based on actual operations in 1985 and 1986. At a
time of very high inflation and devaluation. when margins change frequently,
the rates calculated on such projections are of limited reliability. The
results are shown in Table 9. The longer than expected construction period,
cost overruns, price declines and lower than estimated growth of capacity
utilization are the main reasons for FRRs in some cases below 102 or even
negative. As indicated at appraisal, sensitivity analysis shows that results
have beeu highly sensitive to changes in operating costs.
5.07     Privredna Banka Sarajevo (PBS).  Due to delays in project
implementation and adverse financial conditions of the agroindustry
subborrowers, PBS was forced to reschedule agroindustry subloans. PBS had
accumulated a cashflow deficit of over US$20 M on account of interest and
principal payments to the World Bank by 1986. Also, about 172 of the
long-term portfolio was affected by arrears by 1985, and the arrears ratio for
1985 was about 14X. Although an improvement over the previous year, the
quality of the loan portfolio remains a major problem.
VI. ECONOMIC IMPACT
6.01     Individual Farm Production.  Information on incremental production
remains incomplete due to the wide range of financed subprojects and
limitations of the monitoring and evaluation system. Moreover, many of the
subprojects have not reached full development stage. However, partial
information available from monitoring and evaluation reports indicates a
modest increase in average real incomes of individual farmers.
6.02     Beneficiaries/Employment.  AIPK records show that about 2,540
subloans were made in the individual sector. This co.ipared to 2,800 estimated
at appraisal. In addition, farm families who were able to hire tractor and
combine harvester services to plant larger areas also benefitted indirectly
from the increased availability of equipment services. Increased employment
opportunities for permanent and hired seasonal laborers on social sector farms
which expanded their area through land reclamation and drainage works also
increased the number of beneficiaries.
6.03     Foreign Exchange Effects.  As anticipated at appraisal, most of the
incremental production of commodities under the project is marketed in the BK
Region. While no estimate was made on the foreign exchange earnings likely to
be generated by the project at appraisal, export sales of the eight
agroindustries financed by the project amounted to Dinars 393 M (US$1.5 M) in
1985 and Dinars 193 M (US$0.5 M) in 1986, corresponding to 3.51 .nd 0.8% of
total sales respectively. The major exporter was Vitaminka (fruit juices) and
to a lesser extent Prijedorcanka (plum products). Exports of other industries
were negligible. That the project has not been successful in generating
foreign exchange is of particular concern since the foreign exchange risk of
the Bank loan is carried by the subborrowers. However, various products
(processed meat, plum products, juices) could become significant foreign
exchange earners.

6.04     Econo tc Analysis.  The project benefits include:  (i) incremental
farm production; (ii) incremental value added from the land improvement,
drainage and irrigation subprojects; and (iii) incremental value added from
the nine agroindustries. The project costs include all investments and
operating costs excluding transfer payments such as taxes and subsidies. The
output of fruit and vegetables, milk and meat and the inputs of fertilizer,
insecticide, concentrate feed and energy have been priced as tradeables based
on their border equivalent values or actual export prices excluding
subsidies. All prices in the analysis were expressed in constant 1987 terms
(Table 10). The PCR overall Economic Rate of Return (ERR), based on the
aggregated costs and benefits of 91, compares to the appraisal estimate of
221. The ERRs for the main components of the project are compared below.

VII. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
Institutional Design and Performance
7.01 The Borrower (PBS). The World Bank loan was channelled through PBS
which on-lent to AIPK and other social and individual sector subborrowers and
was responsible for appraisal and supervision of subprojects. Although PBS
had expertise in agriculture, livestock, drainage and agroindustries,
additional appointments were made in marketing and procurement under the
project. Also international consultants were recruited to assist with the
appraisal of the potato processing plant and establishment of a supervision
and monitoring system as required under the Loan Agreement. PBS had
difficulty in appraising and processing the number of preparation reports
submitted by PU of AIPK. Training organized in 1979 to enable more staff in
Basic Banks to appraise minor subprojects directly had been useful. However,
PBS staff strength and experience to assess the viability of various project
investments remained limited and PBS encountered difficulties in: (i) review
of technical and financial justification for conceptual changes in
agroindustry investments; (ii) review of cost estimates; (iii) financial
viability review of substantially increased investments; (iv) supervision of



- 17 -
approved subprojects; and (v) review of adequate financing for subproject
implementation. This was partially due to the absence of clear lines of
responsibility and the absence of a single entity in PBS fully engaged with
the project. Supervision and monitoring of financial data during the early
phase of the project was inadequate as was review of procurement documents.
The procurement specialist worked only part-time on the project and the
marketing specialist left PBS in the early stages of the project.
7.02     PBS became more actively involved in the implementation of the
project and recruited more staff for supervision in 1981. Further, during the
course of the project, a number of changes occurred in the financial situation
and in the physical implemeptation of the subprojects that PBS should have
signalled to the Bank for discussion.
7.03 The Project Unit (PU). The PU consisted initially of a Director, three
coordinators (livestock, cereals and legal affairs), two interpreters and
support staff working full-time. Subsequently it was expanded by an economist
(M&E), a fruit and vegetable expert and a civil works engineer. A Project
Implementation Committee was established to accelerate project implementation
through weekly progress meetings in February 1981. Execution Groups were set
up in each of the agroindustries to activate construction and worked closely
with PU staff since 1983.
7.03     Technical documents, feasibility studies and tender documents were
prepared by different units within AIPK. The PU decided to implement most of
the subprojects immediately creating a bottleneck for appraisal at PBS. The
AIPK Internal Bank reviewed the documents from BOALs before submitting them to
PBS. Consultants were engaged to assist with the detailed engineering design
and bid document preparation for the potato processing plant, all four meat
processing plants and the dairy plant. The PU was generally effective in
carrying out its responsibilities of physical project implementation,
particularly as staff gained experience and confidence in dealing with
contractors. They were hard working and dedicated. The PU carried out
regular supervision of subprojects which enhanced implementation and often
mediated in conflicts arising between BOALs and contractors.
7.04     AIPK improved and strengthened the agricultural extension service
offered through Zadrugas and BOALs to farmers of the project area in
accordance with the Loan Agreement. Each Zadruga established 52 basic
extension services each covering a number of villages. The extension agents
were instrumental in assisting farmers interested in associating with the
project activities particularly during the second half of the project.
However, the extension agents were sometimes diverted from their basic
assignments of technical and planning support, to coordinating delivery of
farm inputs and outputs to the social sector.
7.05     The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System was prepared by a Yugoslav
firm but initially the M&E tasks were performed on a part-time basis by PU
staff and data collection and M&E activities started by spring of 1982. A
first annual M&E report covered subprojects completed by January 1, 1982, and
operating during the fall of 1982 (the sample consisted of 17 farms). During
1983, 70 farms (5% of the total) were surveyed. The unit prepared annual
reports covering project activities from 1983 to 1984.

Performance of the Bank
7.06     The project design to integrate production and processing and to
improve cooperation between the social and individual sectors was too complex,
and a greater impact could have been achieved by designing a less complex
project to increase primary production required to provide adequate supplies
of raw materials for new and expanded agroindustries.
7.07     While the investments in agroindustries used modern imported
technology in their design, less attention has been paid to the availability
of raw materials and marketing of finished products. Some subprojects were
over-designed. This was particularly the case for the Glamocanka potato
processing factory which had processing equipment installed in an operation
that was not based either o.. sufficiency of raw material, nor proven market
demand. The market potential for plum products in view of the vast
competition on the internal market was also insufficiently considered.
7.08     During project execution, emphasis was placed on the development of
nine agroindustries. Bank supervision missions were concerned with issues
related to the preparation of technical and financial documents required for
appraisal by PBS and the Bank, for tendering, and procurement. Supervision
missions generally advised caution when several subborrowers proposed
expansions to their plants. Throughout the project, supervision missions made
comments and contributed to technical and procurement issues, physical
implementation and disbursement aspects of the project. However, Bank
missions did not always closely monitor the PBS's application of criteria
outlined for subproject appraisals, particularly criteria related to financial
viability and adequate financial structure of the subborrowers. In spite of
financial problems and poor financial management of agroindustries, no
financial analyst took part in supervision until mid-1984.
7.09     With hindsight, it appears that an important opportunity was missed
during the project revision requested by the Bank in 1981. The change
requested PBS to reduce the scope of investments in the agroindustries to a
level consistent with expectations of consumer demand and availability of
local funds. However, the revision led only to a relatively modest down
sizing of the project which included the elimination of two support services
to the individual livestock farmers and the elimination of one agroindustry
(para 3.03).
7.10     The Bank concluded its involvement in project implementation by a
review of all project agroindustries with the exception of dairy and poultry
processing in October 1984. It developed a three-phase restructuring plan to
strengthen the industries and to make them more competitive and financially
viable in the difficult financial environment. However, as described earlier
(para 5.05), the Bank's recommendations were not implemented due to lack of
support by PBS.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Overview
8.01       While the physical goals of the project were met, considerable
difficulties remain in promoting growth of agricultural production and food
processing mainly due to the adverse macroeconomic conditions prevailing in
the country, the lack of financial planning and controls, management



- 19 -
deficiencies and overstaffing, raw material supply problems and inadequate
marketing arrangements. Also, the completion of the physical implementation
of many components, particularly the agroindustries component, has been
delayed by two to three years. The delays in investments in primary
production and support services and the resulting delays in production
contributed to raw material shortages for some of the agroindustries.
8.02     Although the objectives of the project were to produce primarily for
the domestic market, due to a contraction of domestic consumer demand a
reorientation toward exports is now needed. This was already emphasized
during the agroindustry review carried out by the Bank in October 1984. While
conceptually and technically sound, the project appeared to be oversized and
too complex for AIPK and PBS. This had been reflected in the long period
required prior to construction starts of agroindustries and in the need to
encourage individual farmers to undertake on-farm investments.
Lessons Learned
8.03     While many of the lessons from this project may be valid only in the
context of Yugoslavia, it seems that the following comments are fairly evident
and should be taken into account in the formulation of other future projects:
(a) Large and complex projects such as this one require careful
preparation. Implementation delays may occur and the project
justification may suffer as a result of unrealistic estimates of
time required to complete technical documentation and financial
appraisal prior to procurement, inadequate demand assessment for
new products, unclear links between private and social sector
objectives and requirements.
(b) Appraisal missions should carefully assess the ability of the
executing agency to implement the project within the agreed time.
(c) Future involvement of the IBRD or of PBS should more vigorously
follow up on requests to subborrowers (agroindustries) to
ensure: (i) adequate supply of raw materials, technical
performance, management, planning; (ii) realistic projections of
market demand and prices for the processed products; (iii)
realistic estimates of likely future financial viability; (iv)
estimates of financing requirements; and (v) appropriate capital
restructuring of plants.
(d) An intensive review of the project by the IBRD supervision
mission by the end of the project could have a greater impact if
scheduled earlier. Also, Bank supervision missions should pay
more attention to monitoring of financial performance of
subborrowers.
(e) While the individual sector farmers responded well to credit
availability and financial opportunity, with more attention from
PBS and with earlier involvement of the agricultural extension
service, the growth of primary production could have been
accelerated.

Re: Project Completion Report for Bosanska Krajina Agriculture and
Agroindustries Project - Loan 1621 YU
Dear Sir,
Project Completion Report prepared by Agriculture Operation Division,
Country Operations Department IV EMENA Region, on February 25th, 1988.has
strived to give the most realistic outlook of the project implementation
and the problems and the difficulties with which Privredna banka Sarajevo-
Udruzena banka, as the debtor, and AIPK bosanska Krajina, as the investor
and in charge of the project, have been facing, being the most important
factors in the entire project. It should be emphasized that the Report
contains respective observations on physical implementation of the individual
purposes and that the largest difficulties and delays have been experienced
in the construction of the agroindustrial facilities.
We are of the opinion that the successful cooperation between
PBS and PU with the Bank representatives in resolving the running problems
ci implementation of some projects, has been insufficiently underlined
that was particularly



- 34 -                              ANNEX 1
Page 2
significant during initial years, having taken into the account
the inadequate experience, both of PBS and AIPK, in implementation
of such a complex projects with large number of investors and complying
with the methodology applied by the Bank. This especially relates
to the application of ICB, particularly when the principle of "Turn-key"
biddings are followed.
It has been recognized that the application of ICB procedure,
applied by the Bank, is ineffective, as the Bank's approval is required
at all stages of work, starting from the notificatio., of the bidding
to the contract with the suppliers, and it is time consuming work.
This increases the  problems       to the investors as well as to the
creditors in periods of high inflation, as it is very difficult to
forseen the realistic inflation rate, especially when the economic
policy of the country has put,as one of its main goals, stabilization
of economy, which is very slowly implemented. The investors are constantly
finding themselves in difficulties with respect to the provision
of necessary funds, particularly when new facilities are in question,
as additional funds has to be looked for, mainly on the basis of
new loans. It requires from the investor to prepare corresponding
documentation for submission of applications for new loans and normally
it all has to come through the respective procedures of loan approval
in the commercial banks. It should be noted that all these above
mentioned steps has to be followed in the circumstances of restricted
credit policy and within the limits of bank lendings, as well as
of shortage of uncommitted funds in some basic banks. That practically
meant having each subproject appraised in the banks for several times,
having normally the impact both on the quality and the realistic
features of the appraisal, primarily as those were the facilities
under construction and it was impossible to stop them. The appraisal
of the overruns is the specific and complex work which is not dealt
by the Bank, as entire responsibility for the cover of overruns
is transferred to the debtor by means of loan agreements, particularly
when Bank is the debtor. We highlight this issue as the PCR might
lead to the conclusion of inadequate personnel qualification, as
well as the insufficient activity and interest shown by PBS as one of the main
causes for delay in project implementation, which in practice is
not accurate.



ANNEX 1
- 35                             Page 3
PCR also insufficiently emphasizes the impact of difficulties
in the economy and the changes in the economic status of certain
productions on the implementation of the parts of the projects,and
it mainly relates to the individual sector.Namely,during the period
of full activities on the project implementation since 1981.,large
disturbances on the livestock market and the disparity in prices
of fodder and the livestock have occured, having great impact on
decline of interest for investment in production of beef and pork
in the individual sector. It happened few times that in already
constructed farms for cattle and pig breeding the production has
stvpped due to losses.
Still, it has to be noted that the project has been
successfully implemented, although with significantly lesser results
than the expected ones, especially in agroindustrial facilities,
provided that it should be taken into the account that the erected
facilities were in the first yearof production with all   the
difficulties relating to provision of raw materials,running -in of
the   technological process,  unexpected difficulties in placements,
financing problems, organizational problems, provision of skilled
personnel and similar.
On this occasion, we would like to lay down some
concrete remarks:
1. Item 2.03. AIPK is not established by the Government but it is
founded on the basis of corresponding self-managing procedures.
2.  Item 2.06. the last line, it is probably misprint, it should
read"Privredna" and not"Private".
3. Item 3.07. the last sentence should be deleted, as the limits
in lending were of short life, as the Bank's loans have been
excluded from these restrictions.



- 36 -                       ANNEX 1
Page 4
4. Item 3.26 - it is accurately stated that PBS has managed to
provide coinancing of the project with foreign commercial banks
and in cooperation with the Bank. The funds have been directed
to energy facilities, provided that PBS has undertaken to provide
these funds to the investors according to the requirements within
the implementation of the project out of other favourable sources.
PBS has been providing these assets from the developing funds
during consideration and approval of the loan applications,particularly
when the overruns were in question.
5. Item 5.07. indicates that PBS had a cash flow deficit of over
20 million US Dollars on the account of interest and principal
payments under the Bank loans. The source of thewe data is unknown
to us, but should it relates to the information from the Audit
Report of the Social Accounting Services for 1986. on the conse-
quences of applying the currency pooling system,then the technical
error is in question, as all consequences of this system are
borne by the beneficiary of the loan and PBS has no risk in that
respect.Normally, there are some delays in payment of due interests
and principal by the investor, but it has not such a wide extent.
However, the far greater and far more serious problem with this
issue is the Bank policy with respect to the conditions for repayment
of the loan. Namely, Bank with its policy determines the duration
of grace period according to the level of development of the debtor
country, and not according to the actual possibiiities of the
project itself for the repayment of the loan. That was the case
with this project. Repayment of the principal was stipulated
by the loan agreement in equal amounts, provided that the first
installment due on June lst,1982., and the deadline for withdrawal
of funds under this loan, as per the loan agreement, was June 30th,
1983.This fact itself shows that this project ,even without the
extension of the implementation term, objectively could not have
been able to fulfill the obligations on repayment of the Bank's
loan based on the achieved financial results. The similar examples
could be found with some other larger projects(Semberija drainage



- 37                                 ANNEX 1
Page 5
project, HE Vigegrad,etc.).Normally, this creates major problems to
the investor, particularly in the first years of operation. All incentives
and suggestions made by PBS and AIPK to amend the repayment schedule
and adjust it with the actual possibilities of the project,have not
been accepted by the Bank. We are of the opinion that the Bank should
not have such approach to the issues of repayment of the loan, but
to adjust it to the actual possibilities of the project in accordance
with its realistic cash flow.
For the purposes of overcoming this problem, PBS has
replaced the Bank's funds by approving the loans out of other domestic
sources, particularly with food industry facilities and adjusted it
with the possibilities of the individual project. Thereby , in some
facilities the rescheduling of portion of the Bank's loan by 1990.
has been stipulated. That should, in fact; create more favourable financial
conditions in the first years of production. This was one of the most
important measures suggested by the Bank in October 1984.,which PBS
has, in our opinion, very successfully implemented.Unfortunatelly, in
Item 5.05. it was indicated that PBS did not show any active interest
in these suggestions.It was only after resolving the financial difficuties
in the Potato processing Plant in Glamoc that the status of production
especially with respect to the placement,has improved significantly,
although the Bank's recommendation was to close the same.
6. Item 7.01. emphasizes again the difficulties facing PBS in its
appraisal of the large number of projects as a result of the limited
possibilities of PBS or even non-existence of a special unit completely
committed on the implementation of this project. We would like to
point out that it was just in this part of the operations in imple-
mentation of the project that there were the least problems and
the least delays. We have indicated above some other reasons having
far greater influence on the delay in implementation of the project,
still there is a question of whether the appraisal of the completion
term of such a  extensive and complex project has been a realistic
one.



- 38 -                              ANNEX 1
Page 6
7.  In Item 7.02. it is objected to PBS that it has failed in notifying
the Bank on the problems and the changes in the financial situation
and in physical implementation of the subproject. The Bank has
regularly receiving the project implementation reports, and it has
also sent its supervision missions that have very seriously appraising
the project status and, within their limited competences,resolving
the problems with AIPK , PBS and the investors for the purposes
of more successful implementation of the project.Unfortunatelly,
the series of problems have been the consequance of the objective
economic and financial situation, both with the investor and with
PBS and its basic banks.
8.  It is stated in Item 7.08. that the supervision missions have not
monitored sufficiently the application of criteria by PBS in appraisal
of the subprojects. With this respect, we would like to point out
that PBS, when relating the appraisals for the approval of the first
loans,has consistently applied the strict criteria necessary
for determination of the financial-economical justification of the
investments.However, that was not always the case when the appli-
cations for overruns have been considered. It is normal that very
often the financial position of the subdebtor has changed and
mainly worsened and PBS has strived to find out the best solutions
within the framework of its actual possibilities. We are of the
opinion that the Bank should, in these cases,participate also in
resolving the incurred difficulties by certain financial supports
through reschedulings and similar.It is not enough to have only
the assistance of the Bank's experts on the basis of contractual
obligations towards other participants, although the same is
the precious one.
Finally, we would like to put an emphasis on the successfull cooperation
with the Bank experts notwithstanding all the difficulties during the
project implementation. Very valuable experiences  for such a complex
projects have been gained and it will be ensured to make much significant

Page 7
preparations in dealing with similar projects, both in organizational
and personnel aspect as well as the financial one, so that the project
Implementation might be much more successful.
It has to be stressed again that the project as a whole has been
successfully completed and in relatively short period, having in mind
its complexity and the conditions under which it has been operated.
Yours faithfully,
Dr. Avdo Spa
