MMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TIlE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
FOR A MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL TRAINING PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Russian Federation for the equivalent of US$40 million to help finance a Management and
Financial Training Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a
maturity of 17 years, including five years of grace. The Governmntit of Switzerland intends to contribute
$1.1 million equivalent of grant co-financing for an integrated pilot project in the field of accountancy,
audit and financial management.
County/Sector Background
2.         The Russian government is in the process of making a massive, unprecedented shiR from
a command to a market economy. The requirements for such a change include restructuring most
productive sectors completely, creating more service-oriented functions, establishing a labor market, and
wholesale restructuing of the government's role. Experience elsewhere has shown that these reforms
cannot be realized adequately without a parallel effort to equip the country with market-oriented skills.
3.         Russia has had little exposure to market activity, even compared to other Central and
Eastern European countries. Foreign investment and private domestic activity have been lower in Russia,
the concentration of employment in the state system has been higher, and the command economy lasted
longer. For decades the managers of Russian enterprises were sheltered from the direct impact of market
forces and were cut off from international management experience and thinking. Thus the basic market
skills iat are taken for granted in industrial countries and in many developing countries are virtually
nonexistent in Russia, for example, accountants performed rudimentary bookkeeping tasks and the
auditing profession did not exist at all.
4.         Under the command system enterprise managers were concemed with meeting quantitative
production targets for established state markets. Their main challenge was to secure the raw materials
necessary to meet these targets. In contrast, managers in the emerging market economy face a much
broader array of functions and tasks, such as raising capital to finance production and expansion,
controlling costs and maximizing the use of available resources, controlling quality and finding markets
for their goods and services. As a result, training requirements are enormous in areas that were
nonexistent, underdeveloped, or distorted under the command economy. This includes such areas as
business strategy, marketing and selling, costing and pricing, banking, financial management, export
promotion, corporate governance, productivity, and quality management and human resource
management. The development of the state sector is also generating a demand for new skills in such
areas as budget and tax administration.
5.         Russia inherited an impressive institutional network from the command economy for the
training and development of management and financial "cadres" that consists of about 500 degree-le'el
institutions plus an elaborate network of more than 100 sectoral upgrading institutes for senior managers.
The system was geared toward the needs of a politicized and centraUy-controlled economy whose collapse



- 2-
has disrupted the system: some training institutions have closed, while others are attepting to reform
and modenize their service offerings, but usually without access to the necessary expertise.
6.         Efforts are under way to bring the management and financial training system in line with
the requirements of the emerging market economy. The most significant and visible reforms have taken
place outside the traditional institutional network through the establishment of new mangement, business,
and finace schools, most private or semiprivate. However, these efforts are limited, sporadic, and
insufficient in the light of progressing privatization. They suffer from fragmeation of effort, inadequate
resources, poor understanding of market requirements, and lack of policies on how to improve the system
has a whole. In sum, the current training system produces too few graduates in market-oriented fields,
and those it does produce tend to be ill-equipped to meet the requirements of open market practices.
7.         The main problems with management and financial training concern relevance, quality, and
throughput. New subjects that were mostly or completely missing need to be introduced, including
problem-solving and decision-making, business and taxation law, product development, market research,
financial management and cost accounting, human resource management. Teaching also needs to be
adapted to local circumstances because Russian conditions are so unpredictable and changing that standard
offerings from the West tend not be completely relevant. Learning quality suffers from the lack of
standards and the competency profile of most Russian trainers. Virually all teachers and trainers are
products of the command economy and tend to be deficient in theory, practical experience, and teaching
methods. Finally, a wide quantitative gap exists between the demand for and the supply of management
and financial training. The present throughput in management and financial training programs of
acceptable quality can barely meet a fraction, perhaps 1 to 5%, of the requiements.
8.         The government faces major structural and financial obstacles in changing the training
infrastructure. Despite several attempts, it has adopted neither an overall staegy nor specific proposals.
External donors are financing virtually all development programs in the field of training. Most external
donors have targeted training in their programs of assistance, and many are providing useful assistance.
However, the assistance being provided or pledged is sizeable, but it can only meet some of the high
priority requirements. With few exceptions the assistance has been directed toward specific institutions,
and, has thus tended to be dispersed and piecemeal. Most of the assistance is devoted to financing
international experts and study tours abroad. Much less is spent on pro-iding training in-ountry,
developing Russian trainers, or adapting training materis to the Russian context.
9.         Based on a dialogue between various government ministries, employers' associations,
professional associations, and training institutions, an overall training strategy has been prepared to
overcome the problems inherent in the curret system. The objective is to organize an efficient supply
of the market-based skills needed for the economic transformation. This strategy has four principal
elements:
*  restructung the management and finance of the training system by redefiing the
central govermment role in traiing provision, creating demand-driven incentives, and
using competition to chamnel development funds to training suppliers;
* improving the relevance of what is taught, generating training materials adapted to
Russian conditions, and giving employers a major voice in determining what training
is given and its content;



*  building quality into the training system by setting achievement standards, concen-
trating resources on centers of excellence, introducing learner-centered tea"hing
methods, and evaluating results systematically; and
*  expanding delivery capacity by training a new generation of master trainers and
management consultants, revamping in-company training, and capitalizing on modern
technologies for distance learning programs (for example, computer-based instruction,
television, and electronic mail).
Project Objectives
10.        The project would constitute the first phase of a long-term program to implement the
strategy for market-oriented training. The overall purpose of the program is to increase the quality and
supply of skills needed to support the transition to a market economy. Within this context, the first-phase
project has three principal objectives, namely:
* to increase the supply of well-trained, market-oriented practitioners in three core areas
- management,
- the financial sector,
- public finance;
* to develop an intermediary organi7ation, the National Training Foundation (NMF), to
mobilize and channel resources for priority market-oriented training programs on a
competitive basis. Through the NTF the project would help make aid flows more
effective and efficient; and
c to establish the basis for a broader second-phase project by piloting effective
interventions in other key market areas, such as small business development, public
administrion, and market economics for the general population.
Project Description
11.        Training areas and programs have been selected because of their priority in speeding the
restructuring of key sectors vital to the accelerated establishment of the market economy, such as
enterprise restructuring, financial sector reforms, and privatization. Within each program, the project
would finance the following kinds of activities: (i) developing curricula and materials, (ii) training
instructors and trainers, (iii) teaching through distance learning and the mass media, and (iv) training
practitioners in-country. Loan proceeds would finance, iP particular, expert services (both external and
Russian); the development and acquisition of other teaching materials; fellowships abroad; and the costs
of organizing and delivering media programs for distance education (including some equipment), local
taining programs, and studies. The eligible program areas are summarinzed below.
12.        Management Developnt (US$14.8 mXilion of base costs). The strategy for assistance to
management development would assign first priority to reforming and upgrading enterprise-based
mamgement, relating the training of practicing managers to the main objectives of economic reforms and
enterprise restructurig. Enterprises would be directly assisted to implement management development



policies and programs that meet the needs of the reform and to retrain managerial staff in high priority
areas. In this context, it is expected that the proposed project would collaborate with the Russian
Privatization Center and, in particular, with the Local Privatization Center in St. Petersburg to identify
specific enterprises for assistance. Second, external training programs for managers would be
strengthened. The restructuring and modernization of both enterprise-based and external training systems
would be supported in the critical areas of developing new programs and learning materials, training of
trainers, and improving quality. Nonconventional training and learning methods, including distance
learning and the use of mass media, would be promoted, and management consulting and information
services would be strengthened. All programs would stress effective application of the best international
and Russian experience.
13.        Assistance would be structured in five subprograms supporting developments in the
following areas: (i) policy framework and quality standards for management development; (ii) enterprise-
based management development; (iii) learning materials, trainers, and teachers; (iv) management
consulting; and (v) networking and information. Project activities -would be started through four pilot
project focus d on (i) identifying and removing the barriers hampering management development; (ii)
assessing the priority needs of enterprises and preparing for enterprise-based, action-oriented training;
(iii) collecting, developing, and distributing recent Russian case materials on management during the
transition period; and (iv) designing a database and compiling the first Russian management development
directory.
The Financial Sector.
14.        Accountancy, Auditing, and Finance (US$14.6 milion of base costs): The proposed
project (developed in consultation with the International Accounting Board of the Russian Federation)
would finance the implementation of a comprehensive, integrated training strategy focusing on (i) a "top-
down" sequence that would attend first to higher levels of enterprises and niinistries; (ii) the adaptation
of international .ccounting and auditing standards; (iii) the determination of income, cash flow, and
related concepts; (iv) the collaboration among training constituencies; (v) the achievement of a balance
between immediate results e.g., problem solving for practitioners and long-term institutional development
(training of university faculty and curricula revision); and (vi) the leverage obtainable through training
and distance teaching to achieve a multiplier effect through the development of computer-based self-
training.
15.        The principal emphasis would be on building training infrastructure, producing relevant
training resources, and developing human resources with programs developed and delivered to senior and
chief accounting, auditing, and finance practitioners. In addition, training programs would be mounted
for senior executives of enterprises in accounting and corporate finance. The project would also support
the revision of curricula in accounting and finance at the university level, the development of teaching
faculty within these fields, and the preparation of computer-based training courses for distance learning.
Implementation of the proposed project is expected to make an immediate impact on the financial sector
in Russia. During the three-year project period, some 750 trainers and master trainers would be
developed as a means to train more than 7,500 practitioners. Also 100 senior executives and 80 faculty
members would be trained, in addition to the production of 100 Russian case studies, 4 computer-based
self-training courses, and 4 adapted advanced textbooks of about 2t) modules each. The program would
be initiated by one integrated pilot project to (i) develop relevant training materials, (ii) train trainers, and



(iii) build training capacity through the establishment of one information technology training center in the
first six months of implementation.
16.        Banking (US$7.4 million of base costs): The overriding goals of the banking program are
to strengthen Russia's banking profession by focusing on staff skill development and to increase student
throughput so as to respond better to industrial demand. The principal emphasis of the banking program
is on training practitioners. The proposed banking program would help implement overall strategy by
financing subprojects under a banking-operations subprogram including: (i) training chief executives in
bank management (strategic planning, credit risk management, financial management, human resources
management, and compliance and control systems); (ii) training mid-level managers and credit officers
in asset management (credit assessment, lending policies and procedures, securities); and (iii) training
department heads and those involved in transactions in international banking areas (trade finance, foreign
exchange, and correspondent banking relationships). A second major subprogram would cover training
accountants in bank accounting and managers in how to use this information as a decisionmaking tool.
In addition to training the practitioners indicated, each subprogram would emphasize the training of
trainers and the development of resource materials, including the "Russification" of international source
materials. The program would commence with the initiation of one pilot project to train chief executives
in bank management.
17.        Public Finance Training (US$4.6 million of base costs). The proposed project is divided
into two main subprograms designed to enhance government capacity to manage public finances
efficiently and effectively. The aim of both would be to train civil servant at the federal and regional
levels in sound fiscal management practices. With the demise of central planning, public finance officials
require both a broad background in macroeconomics, financial management, and accounting as well as
training in the specifi; skills associated with the budget process and taxation in a market economy. The
first subprogram would be designed in modular format to provide parliamentarians as well as senior and
miid-level officials with relevant training in budget and taxation policy. The second, which would be
developed in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), would train new Treasury officials in the Ministry of Finance
in budget execution. Each subprogram would involve a limited amount of overseas training for senior
federal and regional managers and for master trainers. Both subprograms would begin the process of
developing capacity within universities and technical schools in public finance policy to create a talent
pool for future recruitment into the civil service. Inplementation of the two sub-programns is expected to
train an initial cohort of 20,000 Treasury officials in budget execution and 4,500 senior and mid-level
managers who require training in budget planning and tax policy over the next 3 to 4 years.'
18.        Phase 2 Pilot Projects (US$2.3 million of base costs). In addition to the above three
priority areas, the proposed project would build a knowledge base for appropriate interventions in other
critical areas. It would finance pilot projects and preparatory studies in such areas as small business,
public administration, and market economics education for the general public. The project would fiance
a pilot project in the Moscow region for the creation of two small business training and support centers.
In Nizhny Novgorod assistance would be provided for training oblast, raion, and municipal officials.
II A separate stand alone project would finance computerization and training programs to improve the revenue collection
capacity of the State Tax Service. Development and preparation of the project is presently in progress with the assistance
and fimancial support of the IMF.



-6-
Support for market economics education would include training journalists in market economics and pilot
efforts at popular progrmming through such mass media as television.
19.        TheNational TrningFoundaion (US$5.3milion of base costs). Faced with myriad and
urgent needs for market skills in the above areas, the question is not so much what to do as where to
begin and how to manage the process without being overwhelmed. The choice is cemplicated by Russia's
size and the number of sectors, institutions, and levels of administration involved. The project strategy
to cope with this complexity is to focus on the establishment of an intermediary for channeling funds to
the beneficiaries. The intermediary is the National Training Foundation (NTF), including a central
institution with a network of regional analogues. The NTP would be the vehicle for defining strategies,
identifying priorities and allocating funds to various locally-generated training projects of high priority.
The establishment of a new organization for this purpose was justified by the broad range and massive
sc-pe of training needs that exceed the mandate and capacity of current institutions.
20.        The National Training Foundation has been established on the basis of the following organi-
zational principles: It (i) is a partnership between government and the private sector; (ii) is a non-
governmental, independent organization; (iii) involves clients, or "users" of skills (e.g. employers) in
establishing priorities for training; (iv) is partially decentralized to respond to diverse local needs; and
(v) is non-profit, but operates on sound fnancial principles in managing its investments and resource
allocations.
21.        The National Training Foundation operates at two levels:  a Central Foundation and
Regional Foundations-initially in three regions (Moscow, St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod).2 The
criteria for selecting the initial three regions were: (i) population coverage; (ii) commitment to economic
reforms; (iii) commitment to the project; and (iv) ease of access for supervision. The NTF has three
essential functions: to mobilize resources for training, to select high priority training subprojects from
among competitive bids and to supervise their execution and evaluation. Each entity of the NTF shares
common characteristics, such as a general assembly comprised of mixed government and non-government
mnembers, a board of directors, a small permanent staff and ad hoc experts for project analysis and
evaluation. In addition, the Central Foundation has a Consultative Council comprised of extemal donor
organizations, to advise on policies, programs and performance, and to serve as a catalyst for raising
additional external funding.
Costs and Implementatin
22.        The proposed project would be carried out by the National Training Foundation. The
project cost is estimated at US$51.4 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$24.5
million equivalent (48%) including taxes and duties estinated at about US$2.8 million equivalent. The
total financing required is US$51.4 million, of which the Bank would finance US$40.0 million equivalent
(98% of the foreign exchange, 60% of local costs and 78% of the total). Bank financing of local costs
at this level is justified by (i) project concentration on training activities in Russia so as to build local
capacity and economize on costs; (ii) current pressures that preclude full governnent contribution to local
costs; and (iii) need for Bank participation as a catalyst to establish the NTF and start its training
2/ Eventually, some 8-10 regional foundations would be needed to cover the entire country and could be considered for
establishment as a follow-on phase to the project.

activities, all of which entail significant expenditures on local costs. The Swiss Government intends to
co-finance the project with US$1.1 'nillion equivalent for an integrated pilot project in the field of
accuuntancy, audit and financial management. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, aad the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events srd the status of Bank
Group operations in the Russian Federation are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is
provided. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 12987-RU dated November 23, 1994, is being distributed
separately.
Actions Agreed Upon
23.        During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government and the NTF and were
incorporated in the negotiated Loan and Project Agreement regarding: definition of NTF programs;
maintenance of structure, organization and stsffing policies and appointment of senior staff of the NTF
acceptable to the Bank; accreditation of Regio'tal Foundations acceptable to the Bank; consultation with
the Bank on the financial terms of grants and loans to subproject beneficiaries by the NTF; maintenance
by the NTF of acceptable internal rules and regulations; subproject processing by the NTF entities in
accordance with the approved Operational Manual; submission of each NTF entity's annual budget and
work program for Bank review annually; prior Bank approval of subprojects over $250,000; and audited
accounts by independent auditors. The following conditions have been met prior to Board presentation:
(i) receipt of a letter from the Government confrming the negotiated terms of the Subsidiary Loan/Grant
Agreement between the Government and the NTF; (ii) appointment of the Executive Director of the
Central Foundation acceptable to the Bank following procedures acceptable to the Bank; and (iii) adoption
of an Operational Manual by the NTF acceptable to the Bank. A condition of effectiveness is signature
of a Subsidiary Loan/Grant Agreement between the Govermnent and the NTF acceptable to the Bank.
A condition of disbursement for each Regional Foundation is conclusion of a subsidiary financing
agreement satisfactory to the Bank between the Central Foundation and that Regional Foundaton.
Environmental Aspects
24.        This is a Category C project: "no appreciable environmental impact."
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations
25.        Although the Bank's lending experience in Russia is limited, the proposed training project
has incorporated some key lessons in projec design. In particular, extraordinary efforts were taken in
project development to build consensus by involving a wide range of Russian authorities in and dut of
government. Thus, akeady in project development, an important dialogue has been created between
public and private agencies over sectoral issues and policy. The result has been a remarkable degree of
consensus and wide-spread commitment to the objectives and means of the project. Moreover, the overall
program has been divided into phases to facilitate its manageability. The first phase concentrates on four
core areas.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
26.        The most recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Russia was discussed with the Board
on May 19, 1994 in the context of the Financial Institutions Development Project aR94-67). At that time,



- 8-
the Bank recommended an Intermediate Case lending program on the order of $1-1.5 billion annua s (not
including quick-disbursing lending). The proposed project is included as one of the operations uri.._ r the
Intermediate Case program. As described in the CAS, the Bank's key objectives in Russia are to (i)
support the development of a market-oriented economy based on private sector initiatives; (ii) encourage
the redirection of public sector involvement in the economy toward the establishment of open and
competitive markets and the provision of physical, social, legal, and institutional infrastructure not
normally provided through the private sector; and (iii) establish the Bank as a trusted adviser to the
Government.
27.        The proposed Project is fully consistent with the Bank's CAS. First, by developing the core
skills required for a market economy to function effectively, the proposed project would help accelerate
the economic transition. As experience elsewhere has shown, economic reforms cannot be implemented
adequately without trained personnel. Second, the proposed project would help to restru.ture key parts
of the enormous training infrastructure and place it on a greater market footing. It would encourage the
expansion of private sector training programs and innovations based on quality, standards for accreditation
and increased cost recovery, with important spill-over effects on publicly-financed training programs.
Third, the Bank's support for strategic targeting of training investments and for the institutional
development of the National Training Foundation should help create conditions conducive to mobilizing
official and private assistance for additional investment in priority training programs, thereby promoting
the Bank as a reliable and trusted partner of Russia. The Status of Bank Group Operations and IFC
Investments is shown in Schedule D.
Prog7am Objechve Categories
28.        The proposed project supports the Bank's program objectives including: (i) private sector
development by increasing the supply and quality of skills required in a market economy and by
encouraging the development of private traming markets; and (ii) economic management by enhancing
the capacity of the Government to manage public finances efficiently and effectively.
Participatory Approach
Project develorment followed a highly participatory approach. The defining event was a
workshop in May 1994 in which seventy-five Russian experts divided into seven working groups to
identify the possible program content of the project. This initial event lead to the formation of Russian
expert groups that provided advice throughout project preparation and appraisal in the areas of
management, accounting, and finance. These ad hoc groups are in the process of being formalized as
advisory bodies to the NTF. In addition, other key stakeholders, including various government agencies
and also the beneficiaries of NTF activities-banks, enterprises and employers-were directly involved
in project formulation and are represented formally in the continuing governance of the NTF.
Project Benefis
30.        The project's ;mmediate outputs would be (i) the development of an umbrella organization
able to define training strategies and evaluate locally-generated subprojects according to technical
standards; (ii) the creation of new and better training resources in management, accountancy, banking and
public finance, including teaching standards, curricula, trainers, teaching materials, and networks; and
(iii) the creaion of new capacity to deliver training, including the development of a private training

infrastructure, local training capacities, distance learning, and in-company training. The ultinate output
would be substantial numbers of people trained to standard in the core skills required for a market
economy. The outcome would be increased productivity and more rapid labor redeployment. The
benefits of the project would be accelerated transition to the market economy, greater individual and
capital earnings and increased tax revenues.
Asks
31.        The project entails the creation of a new institutional structure in a complex and changing
environment. Potential risks include: (i) lack of quality control in subproject selection; (ii) inadequate
application of financial controls; (iii) insufficient demand for, or failure to repay, subproject loans funds;
and (iv) a possible dispersion of funds over too many programs with consequent loss of impact. The
project design has incorporated structures, procedures and criteria to minimize the above risks. However,
in such a fluid context, such factors must be kept under close review. Finalil, the project entails
development work such as curricula and materials development and training trainers. Full realization of
the benefits from the project depends on their dissemination and application under subsequent
investments.
Recommendaton
32.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of Bank
and recommend that the Erecutive Directors approve the proposed loan.
