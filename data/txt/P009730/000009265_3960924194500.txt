freedom to the borrower in deciding on the subprojects to be financed
under the project once these projects fulfilled specified engineering

detailed project costs or number of beneficiaries were not exactly

PROJECT COMPLET'LON REPORT
INDIA GUJARAT MEDIUM IRRIGATION PROJECT (CREDIT 808-IN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Iatroduction
1.       The Gujarat Medium Irrigation Project was the second IDA-supported
line-of-credit project designed to promote investments in medium-sized irriga-
tion projects in India. The first project of this kind was the Orissa
Irrigation Project (Credit 740-IN) for which OED issued an audit report on May
17, 19a5 (Report No. 5661). Both projects involved the Bank in devolving some
of its normal appraisal and supervision responsibilities to an Indian
institution, the Central Water Commission (CWC).
Oblectives
2.       The credit financed the construction of new medium irrigation projects,
the modernization of projects already in operation, the establishment of a
network of automatic discharge measuring stations, and the technical services
needed to execute monitoring and evaluation studies. The cost of constructing
new medium projects, which was estimated at Rs 1178.8 M (US$137.07), was
expected to be about 80% of the total project cost. Modernization costs were
estimated at Rs 276.9 M (US$32.2). Equipment, including the river gauging
network, was expected to cost Rs 7.91 M, US$0.92 1), and technical services Rs
2.69 M (US$0.31 M). Total project cost was estimated at Rs 1,466.3 M (US$170.5
M). IDA approved a credit of US$85.0 M, which was to fully finar.ce the foreign
exchange component and 40% of local costs.
Implementation Experience
3.       The credit became effective on October 31, 1978.  In December 1978, the
U.S. Agency for International Development decided to provide a loan of US$30 M
for Gujarat's medium irrigation development, which enabled the Government of
Gujarat to step up its investment p;rogram. In accordance with the criteria and
procedures agreed upon with IDA, the Government of India made its CWC
responsible for appraising the sub-projects and monitoring their progress. In
keeping with the line-of-credit approach, the number of sub-projects to be
included under the time slice had not been predetermined at appraisal. A total
of 23 new medium and 6 modernization projects were appraised by CWC. IDA
approved 22 medium and all modernization p ojects under the project, which was
fully disbursed by June 1984.
4.       Owivg to the generally slow and uneven progress of construction, only
one new MIP was partly completed and operational at the closing date, while the



v 
remaining new sub-projects were at various stages of construction. Moderniza-
tion projects were even more behind schedule, so that the wc:ks on the main
distribution system of only one project were substantially completed. Thus, the
eonstruction of new and modernization projects will take longer to implement
than the five years estimated at appraisal. Progress to date suggests that, on
the average sub-project, the works should be completed within a total period of
10 years. The costs per irrigable hectare of constructing new irrigation works
are now estimated to be 22% greater than appraised, and the costs of modernizing
old works 35% greater. Because of greater-than-expected areas irrigated,
however, total project costs will be 102% greater than estimated at appraisal.
Although delayed by one year, the stream-flow monitoring program was implemented
smoothly. The technical services concentrated on socio-economic investigations
- the results of which were used in preparing phase II of the project - and on
network design and water management studies.
Results
5.       The MIP component would create at full development a total of 192,436
ha of new cultivable command areas in contrast to the 63,000 ha anticipated at
appraisal; the modernization component covered a total command area of 151,674
ha, whereas the appraisal estimate was 55,000 ha. The economic rates of return
(ERR) of new MIPs estimated at completion were in the range 12-14%, substan-
tially lower than the average 19% estimated at appraisal. However, the addition
of modernization works, begun substantially in the follow-up Gujarat Medium
Irrigation II Project (Credit 1496-IN), bring the overall project ERR to 30%,
compared with 20% at appraisal.
6.       The water management studies covered two distributaries in the Panam
sub-project and focused on design and realignment of the network, appropriate
structures, integration of existing tanks for additional in-system storage, and
field channel construction that could handle a rotational water supply on an
"on-off" schedtle with fixed constant flows at predetermined times. These pilot
efforts led to the development of the structured network design approach, a
concept that is being considered for all new future Bank-supported schemes in
India.
Sustainability
7.       Institution building was a major objective of the project, continuing
the arrangements pioneered under the preceding, Orissa Irrigation Project. The
involvement of GOI's Central Water Commission under this credit in appraisal and
review of sub-projects helped ensure continuity and hence sustained institution-
building efforts.
Findings and Lessons
8.       The project experienced several major problems during implementation:
(a) technical and engineering staff were in short supply for sub-
project planning, design and extension. The human resource



- vi -
component was weakly appraised; the appraisal report implied that
available staff would ensure smooth project implementation.  While
this risk was not foreseen at appraisal, it turned out to be a
major factor in the implementation delays;
(b) the dam and spillway designs had to be reviewed in 1979 and 1983
following unprecedented floods;
(c) the project was initiated without statewide standards and criteria
for minor system design, and staff were inexperienced in minor
network planning and design. Both factors contributed to slow
progress in this part of the project. The appraisal dealt
extensively with design criteria, but owing perhaps to inexperi-
ence it did not recognize the importance of minor systems design,
particularly in regard to the introduction of rotational water
supply.
(d) the acquisition of land for the construction of the main canals
and distributary sletem on some 10 sub-projects was delayed
because of inadequate planning, lengthy administrative procedures,
and insufficient compensation packages for the displaced people;
(e) the quality of construction, particularly of the lining component,
was difficult to assure owing to insufficient embankment
compaction and inappropriate methods of lining; and
(f) not enough attention was given to sociological issues, particu-
larly resettlement. Specifically, there were no understandings
pertaining to the planning of resettlement, to compensation, to
the creation of new facilities for displaced persons, or to any
other measures that would enable them to regain a standard of
living comparable to or better than their pre-relocation
situation.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
Backaround
1.01    The State of Gujarat covers an area of 18.8 N ha and its population,
according to 1983 estimates, is about 36 M. Although Gujarat i8 relatively
urbanized and has a fast-growing manufacturing sector, the agricultural
sector accounts for more than one-third of the State's income and for riore
than 60% of the working population (1981). Agricultural productiou fluc-
tuates greatly since the rainfall in much of Gujarat is low and highly vari-
able and irrigatiou facilities are limited. The state is therefore suscep-
tible to drought and famine. Serious food shortages due to drought have
occurred at least 25 times since 1900.
1.02    Gujarat"s water resources are heavily concentrated in the southern
and central parts of the State. Three large rivers flow through this area
and the rainfall there is relatively high. In contrast, North Gujarat,
Saurashtra, aud Kutch have limited surface aud groundwater resources, but
have high to exceptionally high needs for irrigation. The following table
gives an idea of the State's irrigation potential.

Government of Gujarat, Draft Annual Plan 1984/85.
The private sector has been the principle force behind the rapid development
of the State's groundwater resources, about 90% of which have already been
tapped. The Government of Gujarat (GOG) has therefore accorded high priority
to the development of surface irrigation. Until the mid-1970s, the emphasis
was on major schemes. But the long gestation periods of these projects aud
the political desire for balanced regional development have induced GOG to
step up the investments in mediumrsize surface projects, which were expected
to have shorter implementation periods and hence high and quick returns.

1.03    Prior to this project, the Bank provided two credits for the develop-
ment of irrigation in Gujarat. The Bauk Group's first loan for irrigation
development in ludis (Credit No. 13-IN, 1961, U0$4.5M) financed the coustruc-
tion of Shetrunji's canal system. Because of inadequate agricultural support
services and lagging construction of field channels and drains, the full
agricultural potential was not reached under the project. As a result of
these experiences, the Kadana Irrigation Project (Credit No. 176-IN, 1970,
US$35.OM) was concerned with on-farm development and agricultural support as
well as the construction of a dam and main canal. 1/
Identification. Pregaration, and Angraisal
1.04    The project was identified after Gujarat's investment pipeline of
medium irrigation projects and its irrigation investment outlays for the
sixth plan period (1980/81 - 1984/85) were reviewed during the preparation
stage. Given the need for expanding Gujarat's surface irrigation potential,
the then planned investment program was considered balanced and sound.
1.05    In the past, the number of sub-projects, their widespread location,
and relatively small size had discouraged the Bank from becoming involved in
medium irrigation projects. Ij However, an apex-type lending operation made
it possible for the Bank to provide assistance for Gujarat's Medium Irriga-
tion Investment Program. The Gujarat Medium Irrigation Project (Cr. 808-IN)
was the oecond in a series of State-based, time-slice line-of-credit
projects. Preparation of the project was carried out in 1977 by GOG and the
Bank, assisted by the Project Preparation Cell (PPM) in Central Water Conmis-
sion (CWC), the highest authority for water resource development established
within the Government of India (GOI). CWC's functions have included inter
alia the establishment of nationwide design criteria for dams and couveyance
systems, dam safety reviews and reviews of designs prepared by the irrigation
departments of individual states. Particularly for large irrigation
projects, CWC has also taken the role of a consultant to those states in
which the experience of irrigation department staff has been insufficient to
deal with the planning and design aspects. The project was appraised by the
Bank in August/September 1977. Negotiations were held in Washington in April
1978. Board presentation took place on May 25, 1978, and the credit became
effective on October 31, 1978.
1/ The subsequent IDA-assisted irrigation projects in the State of Gujarat
are the Gujarat Irrigation II Project (Cr. 1011-IN; US$175); the Gujarat
Medium Irrigation II Project (Cr. 1496-IN; US$172), which is a follow-up
to the Gujarat Medium Project; and the Narmada investments, Gujarat
Narmada Canal (Cr. 1496-IN), and Gujarat Narmada Dam (Cr. 1552-IN;
'n. 2497-IN).
2/ Following the classification applicable to irrigation schemes in India
since 1978, irrigation proje'ts having cultivable command areas (CCA)
greater than 10,000 ha are considered major schemes; medium schemes have
CCAs in the range of 2,000 to 10,000 ha, and minor schemes have CCAs of
less than 2,000 ha.

1.06    At the time of the negotiations, U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) and GOI were considering the possibility of channeling
US$30M of USAID funds to GOG in addition to the proposed IDA credit to sup-
port GOG's development plan for MIPs. The USAID loan materialized in Decem-
ber 1978.
IIL THE PROJECT AT APP41SAL
The Project Area
2.01    The subprojects and the areas they cover are scattered throughout
Gujarat. Subprojects are located in all five major agroclimatic zones, but
most of the new MIPs are concentrated in central Gujarat. Modernization
projects are located in Saurashtra as well as in central Gujarat. The area
to be covered during the time slice was estimated to be about 118,000 ha
(net CCA). In the course of project implementation, however, the area
increased to 354,110 ha, of which about 46Z will be in modernization
projects, and the number of households in the project area increased to an
estimated 112,000 (1981), and the projected benefiting farm families to about
94,200. Average holdings, which average about 3.4 ha, range from 4.1 ha in
Saurashtra to 3.0 ha in central Gujarat. The CCAs of newly constructed MIPs
vary greatly, but on the average cover about 8,750 ha.
Project ScoDe
2.02    The project consisted of four distinct components:
(a) Construction, over a five-year period, of medium irrigation projects,
rovering about 63,000 ha throughout the State;
(b) Modernization of existing medium irrigation projects (covering about
55,000 ha) in order to bring them up to the technical standards
agreed with IDA for new projects;
(c) A network of automatic discharge measuring stations that will improve
the hydrological data base used in the planning of future major and
medium projects; and
(d) MonitoriLg and evaluation studies.
Cost and Finance
2.03    The credit was to support a five-year segment of Gujarat's medium
irrigation program. At appraisal, GOG's investment pipeline for 1978 to 1984
consisted of 22 ongoing medium projects; in addition, 64 new medium projects
were suggested for investigation. In accordance with the line-of-credit
approach adopted for this project, specific sub-projects were not appraised
individually by IDA but were to be appraised by CWC in line with procedures
agreed at appraisal. In principle, all medium projects that met the agreed
criteria were eligible for funding under the credit. In view of the invest-
ment pipeline presented at the time, it was estimated, however, that the
design of about one-third of the 30 ongoing MIPs could be modified, and about
ten of new MIPs in Gujarat's project pipeline would be designed specifically

to meet the stipulated criteria (2ee Annex 1). These estimates were used to
calculate project base costs, vhich came to Rs 1176.7 M, excluding price
contingencies. These costs are summarized below:

The IDA credit of US$85M was to fully finance the foreign exchange component
and about 40X of local cost. Appraisal assumptions of the cost estimates are
further discussed in para 4.01 where they are compared to actual expendi-
tures. The USAID funds of US$30 M, granted after negotiations, enabled GOG
to step up the pace of MIP development (para 4.02).
Procurement
2.04    MIPs.  Civil works were to be constructed by labor-intensive methods.
Because these works are relatively small and are scattered throughout the
State, it was considered uneconomical to group them into large contracts
suitable for international competitive bidding (ICB). Contracts for con-
struction works for dams, spillways, and the main canals were to be awarded
according to local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures. The remaining works
were to be completed under small unit contracts. Force account was to be
limited to a maximum of 10% of all civil works.
2.05    Modernization.  Given the labor-intensive character of these works
and th- need to schedule construction so that the water delivery schedules
would not be severely disrupted, tenders were to be invited for piecework
contracts from qualified firms.
2.06    Vehicles and Equipment.  ICB procedures were deemed impractical for
these components since individual orders of the stream-gauging equipment were
expected to cost less than US$100,000, and the field vehicles to be procured
would depend on servicing facilities and the availability of spare parts.
Standard GOG procedures were considered satisfactory for the procurement of
these items.



-5-
Implementation Organization
2.07    The Appraisal Committee (AC) established within GOI's CWC to appraise
MIPs under Orissa Irrigation Project (Credit 740-IN) was to appraise each
sub-project (para 1.05). In the project cycle, GOG was to identify and to
prepare the sub-projects according to the design criteria agreed with IDA.
GOG was to submit the preparation reports of MIPs or modernization projects
to CWC's AC for appraisal. The AC was required to visit the sub-project area
and review the proposed MIP or modernization project in detail. The AC was
to ensure that, from an engineering viewpoint, designs were technically sound
and that the specified technical and economic criteria were met. 1.1 The AC
was to confirm and adjust the cost estimates as well as implementation
schedules as necessary and to prepare a Project Summary to be submitted to
IDA. The AC was authorized to approve each sub-project suggested by GOG on
behalf of IDA that met the agreed criteria, had a benefit-cost ratio exceed-
ing 1.0, and costed less than Rs 70 M (excluding price contingencies). IDA
was to participate in the field appraisals of sub-projects with a command
area of more than 12,000 ha. Furthermore, IDA was to review and appraise
sub-projects costing more than Rs 70 M. Disbursements were to be initiated
after CWC and IDA approval. After sub-project appraisal and approval, AC
staff were to review project implementation three times during each construc-
tion season; this activity was to consist of field visits and the preparation
and updating of an implementation report.
Benefits
2.08    The initial economic analysis assumed that about 10 MIPs already
under construction and 10 new MIPs would be financed under the credit. Five
sub-projects already in operation were to be modernized. Together these
sub-projects were expected to cover a total of 118,000 ha. The project was
to increase foodgrain production by about 113,000 tons at full development
and was expected to benefit 23,000 farm families lirectly and to generate
10,000 full-time jobs in farm employment and 12,000 full-time jobs nonfarm
employment. The project's overall economic rate of return (ERR) was
estimated at 20Z.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENT&TION
Effectiveness and Start-up
3.01    Once the Development Credit Agreement was signed, GOG's Irrigation
Department (ID) made every effort to bring designs of sub-projects already
under investigation or construction at that time into conformity with the
appraisal standards agreed upon. Within eight months of credit effective-
ness, GOG submitted seven sub-project appraisal reports to the AC in the
agreed upon format. In consultation with the Bank, CWC appraised and sub-
sequently approved the sub-projects. The annual progress is summarized below
(see Table 1 for details).
jj A summary of the specified teebuical and economic criteria is presented
in Annex 1.

The initially approved sub-projects were already well identified and the
required data for the preparation report to be submitted to aWC were avail-
able. After the initial rush, appraisal progress slowed considerably. GOG's
preparation of subsequent sub-projects was at early stages in the project
cycle at that time, and the slowdown was a result of the time required to
collect necessary data. In 1980, CWC decided to take a more active role in
coordinating the sub-project preparation done by GOG and to take respon-
sibility in preparing the sub-projects' appraisal reports. However, it was
mainly GOG's ID that supplied data and engineering details required to draft
the reports. Nainly owing to staffing constraints, GOG's submission of
required information was delayed (para 3.04). By the end of 1983, CWC had
appraised 29 sub-projects, of which IDA approved 28 for disbursement. 1/
Pbvsical MWorks
3.02    MIPs.  IDA approved 22 MIPs that were to be started or finished under
the project. Table 2 presents a summary of the construction progress by
sub-project up to June 1984. Of the 22 new MIPs, four had cultivable command
areas (CCAs) of more than 10,000 hectares and thus could be classified as
major irrigation projects according to Indian standards.  Dams were con-
structed in nine MIPs. The main conveyance systems were more than 50% com-
plete in 13 projects. The construction of the minor network was less than
half complete in 10 sub-projects and not even started in another 10
sub-projects. The reasons for the slow progress in implementation are dis-
cussed in paras 3.04 to 3.06.
1/  CWC approved another HIP (Zankhari) in 1983. The Bank did not accept
this scheme for inclusion under Phase I of the project owing to the fact
that it still required clearance of GOI's Forest Department. The PCR
refers only to the 22 MIPs eligible for disbursement.



-7-
3.03    -odernization.  IDA approved six modernization projects that con-
centrated on lining the main and minor system and extended the minor network
down to blocks of 5-8 ha. CCAs exceeded 10,000 ha in five sub-projects which
can therefore be considered major irrigation projects. At project closing,
modernization works on the main conveyance system were more or less complete
in only one scheme, while works on the minor networks were in early stages
in only two schemes. A tight schedule was maintained for modernization works
so that the canal would not have to be closed for a prolonged period and thus
agricultural production would not be jeopardized. However, modernization
works were affected, although to varying degrees, by problems discussed in
the following paras.
3.04    Because technical and enkineerinnLstaff were in short suRRlY at the
start of the project, and the staff build-up did not take place as quickly
as required, the initial planning and design of sub-projects proceeded
slowly. GOG's decision to revise the dam and spillway designs in the light
of the unprecedented flood in the fall of 1979 further delayed implementation
aud further extended staff in the Irrigation Department. Only about 80% 1/
of the staff targets set out in the sub-project appraisal reports were
reached by mid-1982. 21 The staffing problems were resolved by the end of
that year with the hiring of a substantial number of civil engineering
graduates (see Table 7). At that time, implementation of the already
approved sub-projects was close to 30Z behind schedule, on the average.
By September 1982, completion of the design of conveyance systems was on the
average 28 oercent behind targets; construction of dams was 36 percent, of
main canais 53 percent and of the distribution systems 85 percent behind
targets. Furthermore, delays in appropriating funds and inadequate alloca-
tions by GOG complicated the planning of implementation schedules of
individual sub-projects and made it difficult to meet the annual targets. a
As a result, GOG revised implementation schedules and cost estimates at the
end of 1982 to take into account available financial and manpower resources.
At the suggestion of IDA, the physical and financial targetb were further
modified in July 1983 and thereafter in December 1983. It was envipage4 that
five of the 28 approved sub-projects would be completed by the project clos-
ing date. However, project implementation coutinued to fall behind, in part
because of poor ma:agement and inadequate monitoring of construction which
did not permit timely corrective actions. Project authorities could not
respond quickly enough to shortages of cement and construction labor in some
sub-projects during 1983. Another flood in Saurashtra in mid-1983, which was

21 GOI/GOG objected against the Bank's observation of insufficient staffing.
However, this constraint was consistently identified by the CWC as a
problem, based ou Indian norms of staff required for a given volume of
work. CWC indicated correlation between implementation rate and staffing
level.
3/i GOI/GOG maintain that actual funding after the first two years was more
than appraisal estimates, and that project costs increased on account of
increased input costs and inclusion of additional works. This is not
contested.

more severe than the one of 1979, again raised dovbts about the adequacy of
dam and spillway designs based on hydrological data that had not taken into
account such heavy storms. Subsequently, GOG decided to review the hydrology
of all Saurashtra schemes, and thus the construction of major structures was
delayed further.
3.05    At the same time that overall construction dropped behind schedule,
the imbalance between heavy emphasis on dams and major works on the one hand
and little emphasis on minor and field works on the other, impeded the early
generation of benefits. Delays in designing minor networks and difficulties
in acquiring land for the construction of main conveyances and minor systems
hampered progress in about 40% of the sub-projects. The overall imbalances
in progress can be seen in the following summary of the physical progress up
to June 30, 1984, in the first nine sub-projects appraised.

It should be kept in mind that the Panam sub-project was already well under
way when the credit became effective.  The most striking imbalances occurred
in the Kalubhar and Watrak sub-projects, where the emphasis was clearly on
constructing major structures, whereas minor network construction was
neglected. One of the problems here was the lack of statewide standards and
criteria for laying out minor distribution networks that would have
facilitated the introduction of rotational water supply; in addition, the
planning of the minor distribution network proceeded slowly because the staff
lacked experience. 1/ In retrospect, these were serious weaknesses in the
overall initial design of this program. Recognising these constraiats, GOG's
ID began to adopt new standards for minor system design at the end of 1982.
The standards were based on the lessons learned through ID& supported
implementation assistance that had focused in particular on the Panam and
Dantiwada sub-projects (para. 3.09). GOG also started training
and increasing the staff assigned to minor network planning and design and
agreed to limit transfers of trained staff to other tasks. These efforts
were reinforced under Phase II of the project with the creation of a central
1/ This is contested by GOI/GOG. Based on further experience under Phase II
of the project (Cr. 1496-IN), the Bank maintains that the level of train-
ing and skills of staff charged with minor systems planning and design
required substantial enhancement.

Minor System Design Cell (MSDC), which is to establish and promote statewide
design standards for minor systems.
3.06    Difficulties have ariseu in acquirina the -rivatg land needed for
the main coaveyance and the minor system in some 10 sub-projects, par-
ticularly those in Saurashtra. Procedures for land acquisition are set out
in India's Land Acquisition Act of 1894 (updated in 1968), which requires
that numerous administrative steps be followed in order to balance public and
private interests. As a result of these lengthy procedures, and in some
cases with delays causing the termination of contracts by suppliers and the
need for retendering, construction was postponed significantly. GOG's prac-
tice of awarding contracts to construction agencies for work on canals and
distribution systems before land rights were acquired and court procedures
initiated by landowners to obtain higher compensation prevented contractors
from completing the contracts ;it the agreed rates. Recently, GOG determined
that procurement actions are to be initiated only after land acquisition
procedures have been completed.
3.07    Lining of the minor distributary system and installation cf control
structures down to 8-ha outlets were both new to the implementing agency and
the relatively small contractors.  Lack of staff and equipment for quality
control within the ID made supervision even more difficult and created
problems in establishing and enforcirg uniform quality standards. Construc-
tion deficiencies were mainly the result of insufficient compaction of earth
works, insufficient wetting before the lining was placed, and insufficient
curing of concrete. By the end of 1981, however, GOG had reorganized and
strengthened the Quality Control Units (QCU) within the construction divi-
sions of GOG's ID. It also introduced procedures for procuring minor system
compaction equipment in order to facilitate departmental execution of these
works. By the end of 1983, the quality of lining work had improved sig-
nificantly, mainly because the quality of precast cement concrete blocks had
improved. However, with the delay in procuring compaction machinery, the
introduction of agreed construction standards for lining works in a number of
MIPs had to be postponed to early 1984.
3.08    Stream Flow Monitorin.  After an initial one-year delay in procuring
required equipment that was not available locally, GOG began to install the
measuring equipment. By mid-1979, automatic water-level recorders were
installed at 20 sites, and staff was found to be properly trained and
equipped to take the recordings. Owing to the extremely variable flows of
Gujarat's rivers, acquisition of additional equipment was recommended. It
was duly procured and installation was completed by beginning of 1983.
3.09    Studies.  The monitoring and evaluation studies focused on
(a) network design and water management, (b) socioeconomic investigations in
new medium-size modernization projects, and (c) water flow monitoring in
minor systems. By 1983, local institutions had completed socioeconomic
baseline studies for all new MIPs and most of the modernization projects.
This information was used in the preparation of phare II of the project and
will be required for the overall evaluation of the project once all
sub-projects are operational. Although the design and construction of the
distribution network of all new MIPs were to be such as to accommodate rota-
tional water supply (RWS), it became evident in early 1980 that the ID's
staff was inexperienced in operating, planning, an4 designing the minor

distribution network of such systems (para. 3.05). The project beuefitted
from its inclusion under the UNDP-finauced technical assistance program for
assisting irrigation developmeut _/ aud by the establishment of the pilot
Water Management Area (WMA) in the Panam sub-project in 1980. The pilot
efforts included water flow measurements in the minor system of Panam
sub-projects, a task that was contracted to local consultants from 1981/82 co
1983/84.
3.10    Water Management.  The water management studies and pilot operations
were conducted in Panam and Dantiwada sub-projects. Initially, the WMA iu
Panam was limited to a 165-ha site at Morva distributary where improvements
were introduced. The existing network was upgraded and realigned-that is,
control structures were added, existing tanks were integrated into the net-
work to increase in-system storage, and the number of field channels were
improved aud augmented. 51S was then started iu rabi 1981/82. The dis-
tributary was to be operated on an "on-off" schedule and fixed constant flows
were to be delivered in rotatiou to each subchak of 8 ha at predetermined
times. Concurrent monitoring of delivery flows (para. 3.08) revealed that
the system could not yield constant flows on the Morva distributary. Flows
were unstable during the on-schedules and existing networks were not capable
of delivering coustant flows, as expected of a reliable RWS. Nevertheless,
the performance of farmers during the first season indicated that agricul-
tural production could be enhanced even with less reliable rotational sup-
plies. Farmers in the Morva WMA had higher irrigation intensities, more
diversified cropping patterns in which high-value crops dominated, and
generally higher yields, mainly as a result of more reliable and timely
supplies compared with previous seasons (para 5.04). In order to demonstrate
the impact of a system designed to supply water at constaut flows in 30-60 ha
blocks, GOG introduced water management activities in a new area comprising
2,000 ha at Sansoli distributary. This paved the way for the development of
the "structured network design." jI In the future, this concept is expected
to be used in many other irrigation schemes in India. The operational objec-
tive of having "rotational supplies with predetermined s6hedules" guided the
planning, design, and construction of the Sansoli minor network. At Credit
Closing, the construction of the Sansoli network was approaching completion,
whereas field channel construcEion lagged behind. Water delivery was begun
in 8% of the design area in the rabi season of 1984/35.
i} Project IND/781/047 Advisory Services for Modernization of Irrigation
and Land Water Management Schemes, Technical cooperation between UNDP
and the World Bank extended from August 1979 to December 1984.
2/ It has since been recognized that rotatioual water supply based on 5-8 ha
"chaks" is not a workable concept, as it requires frequent opening and
closing of gates to such chaks if a manageable stream size (about 1
cusec) is to be delivered. The chak size needs to be about 30-60 ha for
this purpose, which was implemented in the Sansoli distributary.



-11-
3011    In addition to the WMA in the Panam sub-project, the Water Management
Team of the Bank's New Delhi office in mid-1983 helped GOG start a water
management program in Dantiwada, one of the moderuization sub-projects.
Dantiwada, a water-short project, serves a CCA of about 44,000 ha. The
irrigated area, however, varied greatly over the years owing to high con-
veyance losses. Water supply followed a demand-orieuted sanctioning system
in which farmers faced considerable uncertainty about supplies, and water
application per unit area varied greatly. GOG introduced an operational plan
for 3,700 ha in 1983/84, which aimed at sharing the available supplies among
all farmers in proportion to farm size. Water was to be supplied in a
predetermined delivery schedule with each irrigation issue completed in one
week and water distributed below the outlet following a rotational schedule.
Preliminary evidence suggested that irrigation ibtensities were higher in the
pilot area than elsewhere (58X versus 48X in rabi 1983/84). However, even
there irrigation intensities varied from head to tail of a distributary,
owing to the lack of calibration of outlet discharges in proportion to area
served.
Procurement
3.12    The project did not envisage any ICB contracts for civil works since
most of the works were relatively small and were scattered throughout the
State.  Hence, overall procurement followed LCB procedures.  In general,
0OG's procurement standards and procedures were consistent with the Bank
Group's guidelines. Minor difficulties arose in four of the larger con-
tracts, which exceeded Rs 6.45 M and therefore called for prereview of the
documents by IDA before the contract could be let. Because of apparent
misunderstandings about the required procedures, contracts were let before
IDA review. IDA agreed to support them after thoroughly reviewing the
various procurement stages. Unit rate-based contracts did not exceed 302 of
the civil works. They were mainly used for modernizatiou works in ongoing
schemes to ensure fast execution over a relatively short construction period
when canal closures would least affect agricultural production. Equipment
was not expected to be procured under ICB procedures, although international
competitive shopping was initiated for the river-gauging equipment since it
was not available locally, and limited ICB procedures were followed for the
procurement of compaction and lining equipment. This equipment was not
expected to be purchased under the credit and required reallocation of credit
proceeds. Procurement of this equipment went smoothly, if somewhat delayed,
and Bank Group standards were fully met.
Compliance with Covenants
3.13    GOG complied with most of the legal covenants (Annex 2).  In com-
pliance with the Project Agreement, water charges were reviewed and increased
in 1981 and 1983 to cover O&M costs in full. Although most of the planuing,
design, and construction criteria were met, sub-projects could not be com-
pleted within the stipulated five-year period owing to the initial and sub-
sequent implementation delays. On the average, implementation of a



-12-
sub-project is expected to take about 10 years. .1/ GOG's Department of
Agriculture (DA) did not fully comply with the requirement that layouts be
prepared for each 8-ha chak served by an outlet, that help be given to
farmers to implement these works and that demoustration plots be established.
Although DA engaged in micro-level works in acme sub-projects, such as Panam,
the covenanted arrangements were not effective in accelerating the develop-
ment of command area works. Under phase II of the credit, these works are
entrusted to the ID, With only one project partly operational at the closing
date, the establishment of demonstration plots in irrigated areas was also
delayed. Although action was still pending under the first credit, the DA
agreed to take early action under Phase II of the project.
IV. COST. DISBURSEMENTS. AND FINANCIAL SOURCES
Cost Estimates
4.01    At the time of appraisal, the cost of the KIP construction component
(area 63,000 ha) was estimated at Re 1,178.8 X (including physical and price
contingencies). The modernization component was expected to cost Rs 276.9 M
and to cover a total of 55,000 ha (para. 2.03). The Project eventually
included construction work on 22 MIPs with a command area of 192,436 ha at an
estimated cost of Rs 2,688 M to complete them. Six modernization projects
with a total command of 161,674 ha were included; their completion costs were
estimated at Rs 864.62 M. With the substautial increase in the area to be
developed, project costs increased commensurately. CWC revised the cost
estimates in 1983 to account for these increases. During appraisal of
phase II of the project, cost estimates for NIPs and modernization projects
were revised once more to take into account field channel construction,
another new medium-size project, and any improvements in the headworks based
on hydrology revisions following the 1983 floods. Because the investment
program was substantially increased, appraisal and revised cost estimates 2
can only be compared on a per hectare basis. In its appraisal of phase I,
IDA estimated that the average cost of MIPs would be Rs 15,000/ha (US$1,740)
and those of modernization projects Rs 4,000/ha (US$470). CC's initial
estimates, which were based on the appraisal of individual MIPs, came to
Rs 14,000/ha for new MIPs and Rs 4,000 per modernized hectare of CCA. CWC's
revised December 1983 estimates averaged about Rs 18,300/ha for new MIPs and
Rs 5,400/ba for modernization schc'ues. The MIP estimate represents an
/ This estimate takes into account the information of the most recent
supervision report of Phase II of the project, dated June 4, 1986.
According to this report, implementation is expected to be further
delayed owing to financial constraints experienced by GOG, which are
partly a consequence of the recent drought.

tingencies.



-13-
increase of 312 over CWC's MIP appraisal estimates, and is about 22% higher
than IDA's original cost assessmento Up to June 1983, the project had spent
Rs 2,972 M, whereas the appraisal estimates had been Rs 1,456 M.  According
to the 1983 revised cost estimates, about 60% of the expenditures for comple-
tion of subprojects were incurred up to the project closing. The costs for
stream-flow monitoring equipment were estimated at Rs 6.8 M, with actual
expenditures of Rs 6.35 M for setting up the stream-gauging stations and for
installing the monitoring equipment for canal losses. The cost of studies
was estimated at about Rs 2.0 M. However, the scope of the technical serv-
ices was expanded to include minor network design and water management
studies, so that actual expenditures amounted to about Rs 9.2 M, which repre-
sents a 360% increase over the appraisal estimate.
Disbursement and Financial Sources
4.02    The actual disbursements and the appraisal estimates are compared in
Table 4a. Disbursement percentages for civil works were adjusted from 60% to
47% when USAID d-cided to support GOG's development plan for medium irriga-
tion with US$30 M. USAID funds were to be used in the same way as the
proceeds under this credit. IDA and USAID funds were disbursed in a ratio of
85:30. Although start-up delays slowed down disbursements substantially in
the fist two years after credit effectiveness, it was expected that disburse-
ments would pick up with the increase in the number of subprojects (paras.
3.01 to 3.07). But, detailed analyses showed that on the average about 57%
of the expenditures incurred for civil works on MIPs up to the end of 1981
were ineligible for disbursements as they covered land acquisition, main-
tenance and repair of vehicles, and stocks, materials, and equipment trans-
ferred from other projects. From 1982, construction progress accelerated and
disbursements picked up. With advancing construction, GOG and IDA realized
the additional need for construction equipment and vehicles for which provi-
sion had not been made under the credit. The borrower asked for reallocation
of the credit, to which IDA gave its concurrence in April 1984. Disburse-
ments under the project's main components as against the appraisal estimates
were as follows:

-14-
4.03    IDA approved 28 subprojects for financing, 6 of which were modern-
ization projects. Actual expenditures for these subprojects exceeded
appraisal estimates by Rs 1,207 N. This difference reflects the sig-
nificantly larger (in terms of area) investment program than expected. CWC
approved about 129,000 ha CCA (or 196%) more in new MIPs than foreseen by IDA
at appraisal. Similarly, the total area under modernization exceeded
appraisal estimates by almost 97,000 ha (or 176%). The size of the invest-
ment program was expanded in part because more funds were available as a
result of the USAID loan, and GOG wanted to include as many subprojects as
possible to take full advantage of the IDA and USAID funds. I/ Furthermore,
four of the new MIPs and five of the modernization projects supported under
the credit were actually major projects with CCAs exceeding 10,000 ha. The
difference between annual expenditures on civil works and appraieal estimates
for both MIPs and modernization projects is detailed in the following table:
AnDraisal Estimate Actual Expenditures
(Rs M)               (Rs M)
1978/79                  177.4                146.8
1979/80                 302.3                 249.0
1980/81                 327.7                 337.0
1981/82                 301.5                 501.9
1982/83                 346.8                 579.3
1983/84                    -                  640.7
April-June 1984             -                  207.6
TOTAL                1.455.7               2.662.3
Although the size of the investment program accounted for most of the dif-
ference, revisions in project hydrology (in 1979 and 1983), higher prices for
cement, and higher costs for lining added further to the cost overruns.
These overruns were reflected in the costs estimated under the project's
second phase.
V. AGRICUL_URAL IMPACT
Generail
5.01    Of the 22 new MIP financed under the project, only one subproject
was operational in 1984 (Panam), whereas the others were at various stages of
construction. The six modernization subprojects were in operation before
they were brought under the project. The modernization vorks, however, were
in early stages of construction at the credit closing date. Hence benefits
to agricultural production were not visible under this phase but will accrue
under the follow-up project. The following discussion is therefore based on
1/ In retrospect, the increase in project scope may have resulted in slower
than expected implementation of individual sub-projects. Concentration
on and early completion of fewer sub-projects appears more advisabe.

preliminary results from the WNAs and on information collected during the
appraisal of phase II, which draws primarily on experiences witb irrigated
agriculture in the five major agricultural zones of Gujarat.
Irrigated Area. Yields. and Productioa
5.02    Now that the investment program for medium schemes has been stepped
up, Gujarat is adding about 192,440 ha of new command area to its existing
NIP area over the next five years (1984 to 1989). 1/ By modernizing six
existing schemes, reducing seepages losses in the canals, and improving water
discribution in the minor network, GOG will bring assured water supply some
161,680 ha (see table 1). Since most of the new MIPs have yet to become
operational, agricultural production is predominantly rainfed at this time.
The Phase I appraisal included a broad assessment on the structure of trends
in Gujarat's agricultural production. The agricultural situation in the
project area could not be described in detail, however, since the composition
of the subprojects to be appraised by CWC was not fully known. At appraisal,
Gujarat's average cropping intensity was 107Z. After the C£C appraisals were
completed, a more exacting, assessment could be made. Despite the overall
progress made under the pioject, pro-project conditions prevailed in most
of the NIP and modernization schemes at the closing date. During appraisal
of phase II of the project, the information on cropping intensities and
yields was updated to take into account more recent developments. These
estimates, which are summarized below, represent the best judgment of the
prevailing conditions and likely developments (for more details, see
Table 5).

On the average, production levels under nonirrigated conditions are low and
reflect the limitations of rainfed agriculture. With irrigation, cropping
intensities in the project area are expected to rise by 27Z, from 110X to
140% at full development.
5.03    Appraisal estimates of yields were based on information from existing
schemes, the WMAs and well-irrigated areas. The estimates presented in this
report are based on Phase II eppraisal data, and thus differ significantly
from the 1977 estimates for the without-project situation. They are detailed
in Table 5. Advances in millet, sorghum, and cotton technology can be seen
at farr level from the late 1970Q on. By and large, farmers with access to
irrigation cultivated the higher-,.elding varieties then available, which,
coupled with fertilizer input, enabled them to obtain higher yields than they
would have obtained with local varieties under rainfed conditions. These
technological improvements were not predictable at appraisal. The data on
yields are compared below.

5.04    Without irrigation, yield levels are expected to remain relatively
low, though higher than had been predicted at the time of appraisal. Farmers
who can rely on a timely and assured supply of water will have the incentive
not only to invest in land improvements, but also to increase the use of cash
inputs required to intensify production. Without such supplies, farmers will
be forced to minimize their risks by cultivating crops that are more drought
resistant. They will also use fewer yield-increasing cash inputs, par-
ticularly fertilizer. Monitoring results from the WMA (Morva distributary)
in Panam project indicate that for the 1981/82 rabi season:



-17-
(a)  irrigation intensities were about 30% higher iln the 'WA than in
non-WMA for farms of all sizes;
(b) cropping patterns in the NMA included higher portions of high-value
spice and vegetable crops;
(c) production expenses were about 20% higher in the WMA owing to the
increased use of fertilizer and organic manure.
Yield data indicated significant differences between WMAs and non-WMAs, as
can be seen in the following figures for selected crops:
WMA        Non-WMA
Wheat        2.35         1.95
Gram         0.69         0.33
Mustard      0.80         0.45
The physical infrastructure of the MIPs supported under the project was to be
designed for rotational supplies, and therefore the emphasis is on timeli-
ness, predictability, and reliability. According to the preliminary results
from the WMA, the yields at full development can be erTected to increase by
30% to 50% over the without situation.
5.05    Farmers in the MIP areas have had limited experience with irrigated
agricultural production and thus it will take time for them to adjust to
intensification and to adopt yield-increasing techniques. Farmers in the
modernization areas have already been exposed to irrigated conditions and are
expected to respond more quickly to the increased and more reliable water
supplies. Appraisal estimates of production increases were based on a much
smaller command area, lower cropping intensities, and slightly lower yield
levels and thus differ from the estimates made for Phase II of the project.
PCR estimates ar. based on the latter assessments. At full development, the
project is expected to geLerate the following incremental production.

6.01    Economic Rate of Return.  Oving to the fact that the  aomposition and
number of subprojects was not known at appraisal, the economic evaluation for
Phase I was based on estimates of average investment costs for MIP's and
modernization subprojects and on typical croppiug patterns of two main
agricultural zones for the calculation of the benefit streams. This approach
yielded an approximation of the overall econamic viability of the project.
The economic viability of individual subprojects was to be assessed at sub-
project appraisal in accordagce with criteria and procedures detailed in the
BAR (see Annex 1). The costiand benefit streams of each subproject were to
be discounted at a 12 percent interest rate, approximating the opportuwity
cost of capital in India. Since only subprojects with a benefit-cost ratio
above unity were to be approved, the approach ensured econamically viable
subprojects and at the same time, consistency of the assumptions. During the
appraisal of Phase II the economic viability ef the project was reassessed.
Since it would be difficult to separate the effects of Phase I and Phase II
of the project, the evaluation covers both periods and calculates costs and
benefits from start to completion of construction over the expected lifetime
of the project. The analysis takes into account the actual implmentation
period, the actual costs incurred, the estimated expenditures for completion,
and the estimated agricultural benefits 1/. The economic reassessment is
based on four representative subprojects, three MIPs, and one modernization
project. The costs and benefits for the selected subprojects are detailed in
Tables 6a to 6d. With the exceptiou of prices for groundnut, output prices
for commodities produced in the project area declined in real terms during
phase I of the project.  At appraisal of phase II the economic re-evaluation
of the representative subprojects, reflected the generally lower prices for
grains and cotton, the dominating crops in the cropping pattern, and the
modest price increases then expected for the late eighties and nineties. The
following table shows the ERR calculated at appraisal with that of the PCR.
However, owing to the differences in the methodology at appraisal of Phase I
and Phase II, the results are not fully comparable.

The projected ERR for the entire project, including sunk costs, is estimated
at 30X. Even though the economic rates of return of the two reports are not
fully comparable since the PCR estimate is based on more exacting information
than the original appraisal estimate, there are some factors that caused a
lower ERR for MIP's than could have been expected: (a) construction periods,
particularly with regard to the completion of the minor network, were longer
than anticipated; and (b) investment costs had to be revised upward to take
into account design changes and a more expensive lining component than was
called for in Phase I. The ERR for modernization works is higher than
anticipated mainly because of the higher benefits accruing from the introduc-
tion of reliable water supply. Furthermore, owing to the implementation
delays in Phase I, the majority of the expenditures for modernization works
will occur in the first years under Phase II of the project. Thereby,
implementation periods for modernization subprojects are not stretched out so
much as they are in MIPs.
VII. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Appraisal Committee of the Central Water Commission
7.01    The Central Water Commission within GOI constitutes the highest
technical authority for water resource development in India (para 1.05). In
view of the expected numerous subprojects and their relatively small size,
IDA agreed with GOI that sub-project appraisal and routine progress reviews
would be the responsibility of CWC. Moreover, the institution building
efforts initiated under Orissa Medium Irrigation I Project (Cr. 740-IN) were
expected to continue. Under the Orissa Medium project a special Appraisal
Committee was constituted in 1977. The AC is an interdisciplinary group of
engineers, agriculturalists, and economists headed by a chief engineer and
provides a capable project preparation and appraisal unit within the existing
institutional framework. The AC's input is reflected in the quality of its
appraisal work, which has been satisfactory and has improved consistently
over the project period. The speed with which subprojects were appraised by
the AC, reflected the preparation and implementation capacities of GOG (para
3.04 to 3.06). GOG also accorded higher priority to planning and implementa-
tion of new medium projects, which explains why the AC appraised the first
modernization subproject only in 1981.
7.02    The AC will have no appraisal tasks under Phase II of the project,
since no new subprojects will be added. Its expertise, however, has been
used and broadened under the ongoing IDA-supported Madhya Pradesh Medium
Irrigation Project (Cr. 1108-IN) and under the USAID-supported Maharashtra
Medium Project. In the project cycle, the AC was to supervise the project;
its duties included field visits to the subprojects and the preparation of
progress reports (para. 7.08). Construction supervision has traditionally
been the domain of the State's irrigation departments, and CWC has not per-
formed such tasks as part of its regular duties (para 1.05). Since most of
the Cwc staff had some experience in construction supervision from previous
assignments in the states' irrigation departments, they were able to pinpoint
major bottlenecks of project implementation. Furthermore, CWC identified the
staffing crisis within GOG's ID at an early stage of project implementation
(para. 3.04), and also pointed out funding problems and drew attention to the
imbalance of the overall construction program (para. 3.05). Although CRC
staff were effective in identifying these bottlenecks, they were not fully



-20-
effective in communicating them to GOG or in discussing remedial actions,
mainly because of differences in the seniority level of the staff involved
(para. 8.06). Overall, CWC was only partly effective in carrying out the
supervisory functions under phase I of the project.
7.03    A dam safety service organization was created within CWC in 1979 to
review the design of dams and related structures, particularly the details
pertaining to hydrology, geology, and structural engineering. Althougb this
unit satisfactorily reviewed the dam designs of the 22 new MIPs under the
project, the failure of a dam in Gujarat in 1979 1/ suggested that an inde-
pendent body of experts could help to ensure that dam safety criteria are
being met during construction and subsequently in the operational stages. A
Dam Review Panel was therefore established under Phase II of the project.
Irrigation DeRartment
7.04    At appraisal, direct responsibility for planning, design, and
implementation of medium irrigation projects in Gujarat rested with the
Irrigation Projects Branch (IP), while the Irrigation Branch was in charge of
operation and maintenance of all major and medium projects. These sections
along with two other departments--the Kadana and the Narmada branches--formed
the Irrigation Wing of Gujarat's Public Works Department (PWD). When the
irrigation investment program was stepped up, GOG recognized the need for a
more specialized department and thus in 1979 separated the Irrigation Wing
from the PWD. Headed by a Secretary of Irrigation, the Irrigation Department
(ID) consists of three main wings: the IP remains responsible for the plan-
ning, design, and construction of all major and medium schemes, except for
Narmada Project; the Command Area Development (CAD) wing is in charge of O&M
in all irrigation projects as well as command area development works; and the
Narmada Development Department.
7.05    At the beginning of the project, progress was slow because not enough
staff were available to plan and design the project or supervise construc-
tion, but with the massive recruitment of young engineers in 1982, the situa-
tion improved (see Table 7). As emphasis shifted toward the distribution
system and operation during implementation, however, the need for greater
knowledge and experience became evident in certain areas, particularly in
minor network design, quality control of construction, and systems operation.
Under Phase II of the project, GOG agreed to strengthen the ID by reinforcing
the Central Design Organization (CDO) and the Quality Control Unit (QCU) and
to establish a special Water Management Unit (WMU) within the CAD wing. The
increase in staff in these units was or is to be accompanied by training.
Training in minor design was provided to ID staff under the UNDP-supported
implementation assistance program (para 3.05). A training component in water
management at all levels of ID, CADA and AD staff has been included in phase
II of the project, and GOG has started with regular courses since 1984.
7.06    Now that O&M has been separated from the planning, design, and con-
struction functions within the ID, the organizational setup is by and large

-21-
satisfactory and is expected to ensure construction, operation and maiu-
tenance of irrigation projects. Despite this much-needed change in the
organizational setup, the effects of poor planning in regard to the operation
of projects are still evident. As has been generally the practice in India,
GOG desigaed the new MIPs without clearly planning the system of operation
for each. 1/ Alt1'ough the MIPs supported under the credit were to be based on
the RWS principle for operation, neither GOG nor IDA realized at appraisal
that a necessary first step was to formulate an operational plan before
design could begin on the subproject (para. 8.03). Thus the MIP designs were
oriented toward Gujarat's traditional application system of water supply
instead. During project implementation, the flow monitoring results provided
by the Morva WMA demonstrated that these designs were not capable of deliver-
ing constant flows, a precondition for reliable RWS (para. 3.09). Necessary
corrective action will be taken in most of the MIPs under phase II of the
project; that is to say the design of the minor systems-- which is still to
be finalized--will be oriented toward prescheduled, rotational supplies, and
the flow rates in these systems will be constant during "on-schedule" phases
of operation. In addition, chak rotational units will be in most cases of
30-60 ha size, rather than the 5-8 ha size envisaged under Phase I.
Agriculture Department
7.07 The Agriculture Department (AD) was responsible for (i) preparing the
layout for each 8 ha block served by an irrigation outlet, (ii) establishing
irrigated demonstration plots in each MIP area and (iii) ensuring that
appropriate services, iucluding extension, were provided to allow a smooth
transition into irrigated production. Nonetheless, overall construction
progress was considerably behind schedule, and only one MIP was partly opera-
tional at the project closing. Hence the establishment of irrigated demon-
stration plots would have been premature under the first phase, as would have
been any measures to improve input services beyond the needs of the agricul-
tural production systems in practice at the close of the first phase. The AD
was to concentrate on the establishment of demonstration plots, farmer train-
ing, and improvements in service infrastructure, particularly extension,
under the project's second phase. Its performance in prenaring the designs
for watercourses, field channels, and land shaping in Fhe 8-ha blocks and in
helping farmers during implementation was not fully satisfactory. Manpower
constraints in the AD and poor coordination between the AD and ID partly
explain the slow pace of progress of works in the 8-ha blocks, and thus the
delay in irrigation. Under phase II of the project, the ID (specifically,
the CAD wing) will be responsible for the design and implementation of the
1/  This is contested by GOI/GOG.  However, the Bank maintains that there
was a lack of operational plans for individual sub-projects as a basis
for corresponding designs, and that the traditional systems of operation
are not satisfactory. This is now being addressed, however, by GOG,
under the Phase II project. The experience with Morva distributary in
Panam project was indeed unsatisfactory: 8 ha chaks are difficult to
operate. This was addressed under Sansoli distributary when the
experience was, on the whole, not as disappointing. However, even under
Sansoli, outlet capacities were not in proportion to area served, and
thus equitable distribution of water was not ensured,



-22-
8-ha block outlays. Since the CAD wing will also be charged with the opera-
tion and maintenance of the MIPs, it has an interest in completing the
field-level works on time. These institutional arrangements are expected to
facilitate the timely completion of most subprojects in the second phase. 1/
Accounting. Auditin2. and ReRorting
7.08   GOG:maintained an identifiable project account for each MIP and mod-
ernization project. Project accounts were audited by GOG's Accountant
General. IDA found them satisfactory and acceptable. GOG complied with
auditing and reporting requirements. However, the deadlines for submission
of the audited financial reports were not met in each year. Audit reports
were to be submitted within 9 months after the close of each fiscal year.
GOG was regularly 2 to 6 months late in supplying them to IDA.
7.09   A two-tier system was set up for progress reporting.  The Project
Preparation and Monitoring Cell (PPM) established in 1977 in GOG's Irrigation
Department with a multidisciplinary staff was to continuously monitor the
physical progress of the individual subprojects and to coordinate the work of
the departments concerued. The PPM's progress reports were to be reviewed by
the AC, which in turn was to provide feedback to GOG and submit summary
progress reports to IDA. Although reporting was never considered deficient,
apparently the information in the implementation reports was not used as a
management tool by GOG in that appropriate remedial actions were not
initiated expeditiously whenever shortfalls in implementation time or cost
slippage was reported.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
Pre-paration and Appraisal
8.01    Gujarat Medium I Project was the first line-of-credit project in
Gujarat to finance a portion of the medium irrigation investment program.
Preparation and appraisal emphasized the engineering, agricultural, and
economic criteria to be followed in preparing, designing, and constructing
subprojects and the procedures to be followed by GOG and CWC during the
project cycle. IDA reviewed and commented on the appraisal reports of sub-
projects and was generally represented at the decision meetings of the AC.
IDA's participation in the appraisal of the 15 subprojects below the free
limit is thought to have been appreciated by CWC and GOG, and its technical
expertise considered valuable.
1/ CADA is now fully in charge of construction of field channels and drains
and of operation and maintenance of any completed part of an irrigation
system (1987).



-23-
8.02    Although the appraisal dealt extensively with the technical criteria
to be applied and the procedures to be followed, not enough attention was
given to sociological issues, particularly resettlement. Specifically, there
were no understandings pertaining to the planning of resettlement, to compen-
sation, to the creation of new facilities for displaced persons, or to any
other measures that would enable them to regain a standard of living com-
parable to or better than their prerelocation situation. The appraisal
mission did not include resettlement specialists, but did familiarize itself
with the resettlement practices in Gujarat, which were at the time considered
adequate. In 1977, GOG"s resettlement and rehabilitation policies for medium
irrigation projects focused mainly on compensating individuals for lost
assets and on replicating the infrastructure in the village to be submerged.
During project implementation, GOG twice is6ued new guidelines for resettle-
ment (in 1979 and 1983). 1/ The 22 MIPs included under the project involved
the dislocation of some 18,200 families in total (see table 8). Because of
the relatively slow initial implementation progress, the majority of people
displaced under Phase I of the project were rehabilitated according to the
1979 and 1983 guidelines (which are sunmmarized in Annex 3). CWC was asked to
review the resettlement activities in each sub-project in accordance with GOG
resettlement policies. Although information was gathered on the number of
families involved (Table 8) and sub-project cost estimates included resettle-
ment costs, IDA was, in retrospect, not sufficiently explicit or active in
the early stages of the project in encouraging GOG to take consistent and
planned action that would enable the displaced persons to regain at least
their previous standard of livelihood. The appraisal mission missed an
opportunity to avoid implementation delays resulting from land acquisition
problems by not initiating resettlement planning and establishing proper
procedures as a regular part of a MIP's planning and preparation process.
Because overall construction progress was slow, however, there was still time
available to improve resettlement planning and implementation under Phase II
of the project. GOG agreed to prepare resettlement plans for 9 sub-projects
in which more than 300 families were to be relocated under phase II. /
Moreover, GOG agreed to improve the compensation offered to these families;
specifically, landless families were to be included in the compensation
scheme, preference was to be given to "laad-for-land" compensation, 2/ voca-
tional training schemes were to be developed, the landless were to be given
1/ The 1979 and 1983 guidelines differ mainly in the limits on the land
to be allotted to displaced landowning farm families.
2/ At the time of PCR preparation, these plans were already submitted to
IDA and approved.
3/ GOG has subsequently not seen itself in a position to provide "land
for land". Instead, compensation was enhanced by providing a grant of
Rs 5,000/ha to enable oustees to buy replacement land themselves.
This has not proven entirely successful.



-24-
first rights with respect to participating in project construction works,
fisheries were to be developed in the reservoirs, and displaced persons were
to be given first rights in exploiting these fisheries.
8.03    Although the appraisal covered the technical and engineering aspects
of the project in substantial detail, systems operation planning was somewhat
neglected (para. 7.06). The appraisal team had intended to make RWS the
guiding principle for systems operation, but perhaps because IDA too was
inexperienced in the operational aspects of irrigation projects in Gujarat,
the team neglected to make the formulation of an operational plan for each
sub-project an integral part of overall sub-project preparation. The
insights gained during the implementation of this project--particularly the
information from the water management studies and from the water management
efforts of the Water Management Team of the New Delhi Office in other irriga-
tion projects--subsequently went into the preparation of phase II of this
project, the Narmada (Sardar Sarovar) projects, and the National Water
Management Project (para. 9.02). A major change consisted in defining
chak-rotational units in accordance with a practical stream size (about one
cusec), i.e., as about 30-60 ha.
8.04    The appraisal mission detailed the implementation organization of the
project, however it did not specifically appraise the staffing and training
of staff desired to implement the program. The appraisal implied that the
then available human resources were adequate to ensure smooth project
implementation. IDA's judgement proved to be unrealistic as staffing issues
constituted a major source of delayed implementation (para 3.04).
Sunervision
8.05    Through mid-1979, IDA was directly involved in appraising two
sub-projects and was consulted during the appraisal of the other five
sub-projects. The first formal supervision mission arrived in mid-1980 and
thereafter a total of seven missions visited the projects at regular
six-month intervals. Following each mission, letters were sent to GOI and
GOG simmarizing the main findings and outlining corrective actions. In
addition, field reports presented detailed comments and suggestions to the
project implementing agencies. Although the formal reviews were prepared
mainly by engineers and economists, the project benefited extensively from
the work of water management specialists who regularly visited one
sub-project and supervised the pilot scheme (para 3.09). Since the first
phase of MIP construction was concerned with establishing major infrastruc-
ture, agriculture specialists were not invited to participate in review
missions.



-25-
Now that the focus has shifted to minor network construction and operation
under phase II of the project, the composition of the review missions needs
to be changed. Also, since the prior formulation of operational plans is now
a required step, the expertise of agriculturalists will be needed in prepar-
ing suitable irrigation schedules. 1/
8.06    Because the sub-projects are scattered throughout the State, IDA
review missions were able to visit only a sample of sub-projects. This
possible weakness was partially offset by the regular field visits that AC
staff paid to each sub-project (para. 7.02). AlthoughS AC staff identified
major constraints to project implementation and expressed their concerns in
their regular implementation reports, the differences in seniority between
CWC review staff and ID engineering staff reduced the effectiveness of CWC's
supervision effort. Since construction supervision has not been part of the
regular tasks of CWC given to them by GOI, but has been a special feature of
the Bank-supported line-nf-credit projects, there was no special incentive to
improve CWC's effective ;8s beyond the requirements of the project. IDA
review missions slowly recognized these deficiencies and strongly encouraged
GOG to use the data given in CWC implementation reports. IDA staff have
helped resolve the issues connected with initial staffing, deficiencies in
minor system planning, and design and quality control. IDA responded quickly
to GOG's request for credit reallocation to allow for the purchase of compac-
tion equipment which was crucial to improve th uality of works. However,
in retrospect, IDA did not do a particularly go.d job in timely reacting to
the consequences (in terms of financial and implementation constraints) of
GOG's commitment of funds to more sub-projects than GOG could complete within
the stipulated five-year implementation period (para 9.03). Steps have,
however, been taken to ensure that most projects under phase II of the
project are completed.
IX.  LESSONS LE
9.01    Overall, the project has been successful.  Project implementation has
not been as smooth and balanced as expected owing to several problems. Those
shortcomings seem to have been recognized and corrective measures taken under
phase II in order to ensure that most of the sub-projects are completed and
operation started during the implementation period of the follow-on project.
These problems relate to the management of implementation, long-term plan-
ning, operational planning, and resettlement.
Implementat-ion Manageement
9.02 (a) Proliferation of SubRrojects. The project encompasses 22 MIP's
and 6 modernization sub-projects covering a total area of almost
344,000 ha, which is around three times the appraisal estimate of
118,000 ha. Since the area to be developed was expanded, the total
1/ This has since been implemented.



-26-
costs by far exceeded the estimates made at appraisal. The fact
that the available limited funds had to be spread over a large
number of sub-projects explains why only one sub-project was partly
operational at project closing and no sub-project was fully com-
pleted within the stipulated five-year implementation. In
retrospect, the cumulative approval of sub-projects should have
much more closely reflected the overall financial and implementa-
tion capacity of the State (see also para 9.03 below). 1/
(b)  Balance in Construction Program.  In many MIPs, construction of the
dam and main canal proceeded much faster than that of the minor
distribution system. Moreover, the responsibility for field chan-
nel construction and on-farm works rested with a different depart-
ment, whose work program was not effectively coordinated with that
of the ID. As a result, few works were completed at the chak and
subchak level. Standardized design criteria have been developed
for planning minor works, and staff recruited and trained. Also,
under phase II the work focus is on completing works. The respon-
sibility for works below the 5-8 ha outlets was delegated to the
ID, so that the former imbalances are now expected to disappear.
(c) Information Manaaemegt. GOG's PPM cell monitored implementation
progress. CWC pinpointed the constraints that hampered fulfillment
of the original and revised schedules and provided regular reports
to GOG and IDA. However, tha information was not used as a
managerial tool by GOG's project managers. Had more effective
implementation planning and review management systems been in place
in the ID or at the sub-project level, it is likely that some
bottlenecks, such as staff shortages, would have had less effect
on the overall implementation time and might have prompted the ID
to respond to these problems sooner. Such a system would also have
shown up the implicit costs of such delays in each sub-project.
The Need f-or Lout-Term Plauuiug
9.03    Although the investment program increased almost threefold in physi-
cal terms, GOG was not prepared to allocate the required funds to sustain
such a program in the agreed time frame. The shortages in staff numbers
during the early years of project implementation and the delays in deciding
on project budgets and allocating funds to the sub-projects clearly indicate
that financial and investment planning were poorly coordinated. A careful
analysis of public finance preceded the appraisal, and confirmed the sound-
ness of the then-suggested investment program. During supervision of the
substantially expanded MIP program, IDA representatives pointed to the
1/ GOI/GOG object to this view. The Bank maintains its position in this
regard. The proliferation of new schemes is explained to some degree
by political factors which have little connection with investment plan-
ning in the irrigation sector.



-27-
budgetary consequences and noted that the economic viability of the
sub-projects would suffer if implementation was dragged out owing to cur-
tailed annual project budgets. Appraisal authority rested with CWC and there
were no legal provisions that formally permitted IDA to insist that the
investment program be coordinated with public financial resources during the
project period. By expanding the investment program for medium projects, GOG
committed itself to providing funds from its investment budgets for this
project, not only for the annual plans and the sixth plan period (1978/79 -
1984/85), but also for the future seventh plan period (1985/86 - 1990/91),
and possibly later plan periods. GOG thereby restricted its options with
respect to possible other new investment projects. In the absence of
long-term investment and financial planning, GOG failed to recognize that
its enlarged medium project investments could conflict with its high-priority
Narmada development program. 1/ In mid-1982, IDA attempted to speed up
progress on the then 23 approved sub-projects by refusing to accept addi-
tional sub-projects, for reimbursement, even if cleared by the AC. In
mid-1983, when the need for a second phase to complete the project became
very obvious, IDA approved another 5 sub-projects for reimbursement. Under
phase II, expenditures are concen rated on sub-projects already approved by
IDA, and therefore the chances are that GOG will complete these projects,
provided no major unforeseen budgetary crisis arises.
Operational Plans
9.04    Under Phase I of the Gujarat Medium Project, the focus was on
improvements in design and construction. However, experience proved that the
organization of the water delivery system and its implications for the layout
of the minor system require, at the design stage, a concept of operation of
the overall system. This aspect of the project was somewhat neglected under
Phase I, but since overall implementation has been delayed, it is still
possible to place more emphasis on minor network design and to introduce RWS
in the follow-on project.
Resettlement
9.05    Resettlement planning was not considered an integral part of the
overall preparation of sub-projects under phase I (para. 8.02). Although
the legal framework and administrative arrangements existed, resettlement
1/ Until 1986/87, this was in fact not a significant conflict, due to delays
in the Narmada program. GOI/GOG object to the notion that some MIPs may
have been included to "utilize the Credit or preempt utilization of funds
under the following project". The fact is maintained that GOG tended to
overextend its budgetary resources to cover too large a number of
schemes. The fact that the costs and implementation schedules were
revised at least twice while plan funds remained constant, and that all
schemes are taking unduly long to complete, constitute evidence of poor
investment planning.



-28-
actions tended to be implemented in an ad hoc manner and wiere not consis-
tently included in the implementation schedules for project construction
works. Moreover, since GOG lacked effective institutionalized monitoring
procedures, it was unable to determine to what extent the compensation pack-
ages it offered displaced persons enabled them to set up sustainable
income-generating arrangements. In recognizing these deficiencies, GOG
agreed to prepare and implement detailed resettlement plans for nine
sub-projects under phase II of the project (para. 8.02). The progress of
resettlement activities is now monitored regularly in conjunction with the
implementation monitoring carried out by the PPM cell. Purthermore, special
evaluation studies are being undertaken to analyze the standard of living of
displaced persons in five sub-projects and to provide GOG with feedback on
its compensation package.

Comments Received From  the Borrower on the Draft Project Completion Report
(3/4/1987)
FROM SHRI G. P. JOSHI, UNDER SECY ECOFAIRS, NEW DELHI, INDIA.
TO SHRI CM VASUDEV ADVISER TO ED (BANK) WORLD BANK WASHINGTON
KINDLY PASS ON THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE TO THE GRAHAM DONALDSON, CHIEF, AHRD, OED. QUOTE:
RE: DRAFT PCR GWARAT MEDIUM IRRIGATION PROJECT,       ank£CQm
CREDIT 808-IN AND YOUR LET I ER OF FEBRUARY 20,1987.
OUR PARAWISE COMMENTS ARE REPRODUCED BELOW:
SUBQUOTE. AAA. EVALUATION SUMMARY PARA 8(A) GOG      Staff constraint was consistently identified as a
FEEL THAT STAFF STRENGTH WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH      problem by CWC. CWC's analysis indicated
THE STATE NORMS AND ADEQUATE AND DID NOT             correlation between implementation rate and
CONSTITUTE A MAJOR BOTTLENECK. HOWEVER, THIS WAS     staffing levels.
SUBSEQUENTLY REVISED TO MEET BANICS REQUIREMENT.
PARA 8(C). GOG DO NOT AGREE WITH THE OBSERVATION OF  The State was indeed following the traditional
THE BANK. THE STATE WAS FOLLOWING TRADITONAL         systems, although the project was supposed
SYSTEM OF NETWORK PLANNING AND DESIGN AND THE        to introduce a new type of design and
STAFF HAD THE NECESSARY EXPERIENCE.                  operation.

BBB. PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT. PARA 3.04. THE  Accepted.
STAFFING DEVELOPMENT DEPICTED IN TABLE 7 SHOWS
THAT SHORTFALL WAS ABOUT 12 [PERCENT] IN 1979-80 AND
1980-81 AND 20 [PERCENT] IN 1981-82. THE FIGURE OF 50
[PERCENT] IN THE TEXT IS INCONSISTENT WITH THIS. GOG'S
VIEW OF STAFF STRENGTH HAS BEEN GIVEN IN AA ABOVE.
ACTUAL EXPENDITURE ON THE PROJECT WAS NEARLY
DOUBLE OF APPRAISAL ESTIMATES, AND EXCEPT IN THE
FIRST TWO YEARS, WAS MORE THAN APPRAISAL ESTIMATES
EVERY YEAR. OVERALL PROJECT COSTS INCREASED ON
ACCOUNT OF ESCALATIONS IN INPUT COSTS AS WELL AS
INCLUSION OF ADDMONAL WORKS. THIS HAD A BEARING
ON THE PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE.
PARA 7.01. AC IN THE CWC IS HEADED BY A CHIEF   Noted and corrected.
ENGINEER.
PARA 7.06. GOG DOES NOT AGREE THAT PLANNING IN  The Bank does not agree. See footnote to
REGARD TO THE OPERATION OF PROJECTS WAS POOR. THE    pam 7.06 in PCR.
MIPS WERE DESIGNED WITH TRADITIONAL SYSTEM OF
OPERATION WHICH IS FUNCTIONING SATISFACTORILY IN
THE EXISTING IRRIGATION PROJECTS. HOWEVER, ON THE
BANK'S ADVICE, PILOT PROJECTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON
MORVA AND SANSOLI DISTRIBUTARY OF PANAM PROJECT
FOR INTRODUCTION OF RWS. THE RESULTS OF THESE DID
NOT CONFORM TO EXPECTATIONS. BASED ON THE
EXPERIENCE OF PILOT PROJECT AND THE TRADMONAL
SYSTEM, A STRUCTURED SYSTEM OF OPERATION HAS
BEEN EVOLVED FOR ADOPTION IN THE SECOND PHASE.



PARA 8(D). LAND ACQUISITION PROCEDURES HAVE TO          The eink agrees that time required for land
CONFORM TO THE LAND ACQUISITION ACT AND CANNOT BE       acquisition was indeed underestimated in
