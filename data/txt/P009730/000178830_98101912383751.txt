INDIA
GUJARAT IRRIGATION PROJECT
Staff Appraisal Report
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.01      The State of Gujarat, located along the northwestern coast of India,
is characterized by low and highly variable rainfall. This has made Gujarat
extremely susceptible to droughts and famine. In spite of large public invest-
ments in surface irrigation since Independence and rapid private development
of groundwater, only about one-sixth of the cropped area is irrigated. Most
of the State's groundwater resources have now been developed and the Govern-
ment of Gujarat (GOG) gives high priority to the development of surface
irrigation.
1.02      The Shetrunji Irrigation Project (Credit Nb. 13-IN, 1961, US$4.5 M)
in Gujarat was the first Indian surface irrigation project supported by the
Bank Group. Subsequently, IDA assisted in financing the Kadana Irrigation
Project (Credit No. 176-IN, 1970, US$35 M) and supported groundwater develop-
ment through the Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project (Credit No. 191-IN, 1970,
US$35 M) and the line of credit to the Agricultural Refinance and Development
Corporation (ARDC).
1.03      The Government of India (GOI) has requested IDA assistance to
finance construction of new medium irrigation projects (MIPs) and moderni-
zation of existing MIPs in Gujarat. Utilizing numerous small rivers located
throughout the State, the new MIPs would provide irrigation to areas where
large scale development is not feasible and where the potential for further
groundwater exploitation is limited. The modernization of existing MIPs
would improve the utilization of past irrigation investments, that so far
have yielded returns that are significantly below the potential.
Agriculture in India
1.04      India covers some 3.28 M km  of which 49% is cultivable and about
11% irrigated. India's population of about 620 M (1976) is growing at an
annual rate of 2.3%. National income has grown at nearly 4% per annum since
1950, and the per capita GNP reached US$150 in 1975. Although average per
capita income has increased and access to public services has improved, in
general there has been little change in the incomes of the vast masses of
urban and rural poor, which--conservatively measured--consist of some 250 M
people with incomes below the poverty line of US$70 per capita per year.
Thus, the Government's development plans give emphasis to alleviating poverty
and creating employment, especially in rural areas.



-2-
1.05      Agriculture is the dominant sector of the Indian economy and con-
tributes about 45% of GNP. It engages about 70% of the labor force and
provides the base for about 60% of India's exports. During the last decade,
GOI development plans have emphasized agriculture and sought to raise food-
grain production by increasing the use of fertilizers, plant protection
chemicals, and improved varieties. In support of this, GOI has modernized
and expanded the agricultural credit institutions and accelerated the develop-
ment of irrigation.
1.06      Despite these endeavors and the impressive results of the green
revolution in some areas--primarily the wheat growing northwestern states--
the annual overall growth rate in foodgrain production over the last 15 years
has been only about 2.3% or approximately equal to the population growth.
Furthermore, India's agriculture remains heavily dependent upon the vagaries
of weather, and foodgrain production can vary as much as 20% from one year to
another. Major factors in reducing this dependence would be the expansion
of irrigation and the improvement of existing irrigation facilities.
Irrigation in India
1.07      Up to 1964/65, the irrigated area increased at a rate of only about
2.1% per year, of which approximately two-thirds was from surface water
resources and one-third from groundwater. Since then, the rate of increase
has about doubled, mainly through an accelerated program of groundwater devel-
opment. At present, the irrigated area is 45 M ha, about three-fifths of
which is surface irrigated and two-fifths groundwater irrigated.
1.08      Much of the groundwater development took place in the northwestern
States, which were the center of the green revolution. The limit of the
area's groundwater resources is being approached and the pace of development
has recently fallen off. In the northeastern states, with excellent ground-
water potential, the pace of development has been hampered by institutional
constraints, such as a lack of a well functioning credit system and small
and fragmented farms. However, there are indications that these difficulties
are being overcome and that the overall rate of groundwater development is
again accelerating.
1.09      After independence the pace of surface water development remained
relatively constant at about 0.5 M ha per year until the end of the Fourth
Plan (1969/70-1973/74). During this period, the physical plan targets set by
GOI for a more rapid development of surface irrigation were never fulfilled.
A major problem was the continuing pressure in the states to start a large
number of projects, which because of limited financial resources resulted
in long construction periods and delayed benefits. However, in recent years,
budgetary allocations have grown rapidly and Indian authorities have increased
their efforts to complete ongoing projects. As a result, the irrigation
potential created in 1976/77 was 1.1 M ha or about twice that achieved in any
single year before the start of the Fifth Plan in 1974/75.
1.10      In most completed projects, actual crop production is significantly
less than the potential created by the irrigation system. Consequently, GOI



and the State governments now emphasize "command area development" (CAD),
with the objective to enable a more rapid agricultural development and
to improve water use efficiency at the farm level. CAD involves public
investment in associated infrastructure (drainage, roads, markets, agri-
cultural extension and research) as well as private farm investments, usually
supported by institutional credit, (watercourse lining, field channels and
drains, landshaping and leveling).
1.11      Less attention, however, has been paid to improving planning and
design criteria for irrigation works. In particular, water losses assumed
in the design of the conveyance system are generally much lower than actual
losses which reduces the irrigated area far below the planned target.
Similarly, water allocation and canal operation procedures have changed little
since the nineteenth century when the prime objective of irrigation was to
provide "insurance" against droughts. As a result, most existing irrigation
systems cannot meet the exacting requirements of a modern agriculture based
on high yielding crop varieties. Consequently, GOI and the State governments
are in the process of starting a major program for modernization of existing
irrigation systems. As illustrated by the proposed credit, both these
developments are supported by the Bank Group.
II. THE STATE OF GUJARAT
General
2.01      The State of Gujarat, covering an area of 19.6 M ha, has a popula-
tion of about 30.7 M (1977). It is relatively urbanized and has a large
modern manufacturing sector; but agriculture, which in a normal year contri-
butes about two-fifths of State income, has a predominant influence on the
State's economy. Continuous economic progress is largely dependent on the
removal of constraints to further agricultural growth, particularly through
the expansion of irrigation. By most other indicators, Gujarat is one of
the most advanced states.
The Economy
2.02      By Indian standards, Gujarat is highly industrialized.  However,
the modern manufacturing sector has failed to provide significant stimulus
for growth. Between 1960/61 and 1975/76, State income grew at an annual
rate of 3.4%, which is equal to the rate of growth for the Indian economy
as a whole. 1/ However, because of the rapid population increase, the per
capita income increased only 0.8% p.a. compared to 1.1% p.a. for India. The
structure of Gujarat's economic growth has been significantly different from
the all-India pattern:
1/   Measured in terms of net domestic product at factor cost at 1960/61
prices.

Total               100           100         3.4         3.4
2.03      Agriculture has grown relatively rapidly, but all other sectors
have lagged behind the rest of India. While the sectoral composition of this
relative stagnation of the non-agricultural sectors is broadly based, it can,
to a large extent, be traced back to textile manufacturing. Declining demand
for cotton cloth from the poorer segments of the population, price controls
and policies to protect the handloom sector have resulted in a stagnation of
the modern textile industry in India. Gujarat's textile industry, which
produces about one-third of the nation's cotton cloth, has grown at an annual
rate of only 1.4% since 1960/61 and its share of the State's manufacturing
industry has declined from 66% in 1960/61 to 44% in 1974/75.
2.04      In absolute terms, the fastest growing sectors of Gujarat's economy
have been mineral production, especially of petroleum products, and manufac-
turing of chemicals. However, these sectors are highly capital intensive
and have few links to the rest of the State's economy. Thus, they have not
increased consumer incomes significantly and they have largely failed to
generate growth in other sectors. Manufacturing of machinery has more than
quadrupled since 1960/61, but it started from a low base and, presently, it
accounts for only 8% of value added in manufacturing. The dynamic growth
of this sub-sector, which was fueled by the expanding demand for irrigation
pumps and engines (para 4.15), illustrates the strong linkages that exist
between agriculture and other sectors of the economy. Another example of the
entrepreneurship for which the Gujarates are famous is the rapid growth of
India's export-oriented diamond cutting industry which is based in Surat
district.
Socio-Economic Conditions
2.05      Population.  Gujarat has one of the highest birth rates in India
and its 30.7 M population is increasing by about 2.6% per year. GOG realizes
this problem and, since 1971/72, its expenditures on family planning have
been the highest among the States. With about 29% of its population living in

towns and cities, it is, next to Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, the third most
urbanized of the States. Although the three largest cities--Ahmedabad
(population about 2 million), Surat and Baroda--are all located on the Gujarat
mainland, the Saurashtra peninsula, with an extensive network of small and
medium sized towns, is the most urbanized part of the State (Annex 1, Ti).
2.06      About one-quarter of the population belong to traditionally dis-
advantaged groups: tribes (18%) and scheduled castes (7%). The tribal
population is heavily concentrated in the rural areas of the eastern hill
region while the people of scheduled castes are widely dispersed throughout
the State (Annex 1, T2).
2.07      The labor force constitutes 31% of the total population.  Its par-
ticipation rate among the tribal population is signficantly higher (over 40%)
than for the population at large. Cultivators and agricultural laborers
account for 43% and 22% of the labor force, respectively.
2.08      Rural Incomes and Wealth.  Rural areas of Gujarat are characterized
by a relatively equal distribution of income. 1/ In a normal year, about 40%
of the rural population have incomes below the poverty line (US$70). However,
there are large regional variations in the incidence of poverty. In the
eastern and southern parts of the State about two-thirds of the population
live below the poverty line, while the proportion in Saurashtra is less than
one-third.
2.09      These income differences can be explained largely by ecological
factors and the historic evolution of agriculture in the State. The southern
and central parts of the mainland, with high rainfall and relatively fertile
soils are densely populated with small farms and a large portion of landless
households. Kutch and Saurashtra, with low and unreliable rainfall and less
fertile soils, have traditionally not been able to support a large population,
which is clearly reflected in the farm size distribution for the State (para
2.11). With the advent of irrigation and modern farming practices, some of
the low rainfall areas' natural disadvantages have been removed and the
average rural household in Saurashtra is now twice as wealthy as in other
parts of the State.
2.10      There are no statistics that give the incomes for different socio-
economic groups, but the assets and liabilities (1971/72) of rural households
give an indication of the living standard of various groups:
1/   Since 1960/61, the Gini coefficient for consumption in rural areas has
ranged between 0.24 and 0.30, averaging 0.28.

As noted in para. 2.09, the present farm size distribution is largely deter-
mined by local agro-climatic conditions, and farms in the low rainfall areas

2.12      Tenancy legislation, giving tenants ownership rights to the land
they previously rented, has been strictly enforced in Gujarat. Depending on
the type of tenancy, the land has been transferred to the tenants either with
or without payment to the former owners. Tenants have either payed for the
land in installments or have taken loans for this purpose from GOG or land
development banks. According to the 1970 Agricultural Census, 97% of all
holdings were fully owned; 2% were partly owned and partly rented, and 1%
wholly rented.
2.13      The land ceiling in Gujarat for areas irrigated from a Government
source is 4.1 ha to 10.9 ha, depending on soil type and reliability of irriga-
tion water. In rainfed areas, the ceiling ranges from 8.1 ha to 21.9 ha per
family. For each member in excess of five, the ceiling is increased by 20%
up to a maximum of 100% when there are ten or more members.

Public Services
2.14      Both the urban and the rural areas are served by a well developed
network of primary schools and 98% of the pupils live within two kilometers
from their school. Primary school enrollment is 60% above the national aver-
age and the literacy rate (36% in 1971) is one of the highest in India. How-
ever, the drop-out rate is high and secondary school enrollment is only half
of the national average.
2.15      In rural areas, the number of doctors and health centers per 1,000
persons is significantly above the national average. The provision of safe
drinking water is a serious problem in this drought prone State, where the
groundwater is unreliable and often saline: GOG estimates that about one-
third of the 18,300 villages in the State have an inadequate supply.
However, GOG is undertaking an ambitious program to provide most of these
villages with a reliable water supply within the next five years.
2.16      The progress of rural electrification has been slow and presently
only about one-third of the villages have electric power. This is largely
a reflection of the capital and power intensive development of the manufactur-
ing sector that Gujarat has adopted in recent years. The comparison with
Haryana and Tamil Nadu is noteworthy: The per capita electricity consumption
in these two States is about 20% lower than in Gujarat, but in both Haryana
and Tamil Nadu all villages have electricity.
2.17      Gujarat has a well developed road network and more than 90% of
villages are located within 3 km from a regular bus route.
III. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
General
3.01      Agriculture contributes 30-40% to Gujarat's State income and employs
about 65% of the labor force. The farmers are progressive and oriented towards
cash crops. Due to low rainfall and limited irrigation facilities, yields are
relatively low, but as a result of improved farming practices, they have in-
creased faster in Gujarat than in most other parts of India. Thanks to the
cultivation of high value crops and relatively advanced farming practices,
the productivity per agricultural worker is the fourth highest in India.
3.02      The potential for further increases in agricultural production is
limited by a number of factors discussed below:
(a) Climate;
(b) Topography and soils;
(c) Present land use and the possibility of expanding the
cropping area; and
(d) Agricultural supporting services.



-8-
Climate
3.03      Gujarat has a tropical monsoon climate with temperatures that are
suitable for gear-round cropping. Daily minimum and maximum temperatures
range from 13  - 27 C in January to 27  - 41 0C in May.  Annual rainfall ranges
from less than 300 mm in the Northwest to over 2,000 mm in a small area in the
Southeast, with most parts of the State receiving 500-800 mm (Map 13202). About
95% of the rainfall occurs during the June-September monsoon. However, varia-
tions in timeliness and amounts are great and in more than 60% of the State,
the rainfall is highly unreliable (i.e. the coefficient of variability is
over 40% 1!).
3.04      The low and uncertain rainfall, combined with limited irrigation
facilities (paras 4.01 - 4.06) has made Gujarat extremely susceptible to
droughts and famines. The latest drought years were in 1972/73 and 1974/75
when foodgrain production fell 50% below its normal level. Especially hard
hit were rice and groundnut growers who, on the average, lost two-thirds and
three-quarters of their crop, respectively. In large parts of the State,
there was complete crop failure which led to severe malnutrition in spite
of sizeable famine relief expenditures (about US$100 M following each of the
two droughts). Although these droughts were more severe than any other during
the last two decades, drought in Gujarat is a regular occurence: since 1900
the State has experienced severe food scarcity not less than 25 times.
Topography and Soils
3.05      The State divides naturally into three geographical units:  the
Gujarat mainland, the Saurashtra peninsula, and Kutch. Mainland Gujarat com-
prises extensive alluvial plains flanked by hilly terrain in the east. The
land slopes gently towards the west and southwest and is traversed by the
State's four major rivers (Tapi, Narmada, Mahi and Sabarmati) and numerous
small streams. At frequent intervals, the major rivers cause widespread
floods in the coastal areas. Due to the low gradient, natural drainage is
inadequate in the northern and central-western part of the mainland; asso-
ciated with the poor drainage are water-logging and salinity. Most of the
southern mainland has deep black soils (Map 13203). The central mainland
has sandy loam soils in the western part and medium deep black soils in the
eastern part. The soils of the northern mainland range from sandy alluvium
in the hilly areas along the Rajasthan border to sandy loam at lower eleva-
tions. Coastal alluvium dominates along the Bay of Cambay.
3.06      The central part of the Saurashtra peninsula is elevated and the
land slopes very gently towards the coast and the plains of the Gujarat
mainland. Most of the rivers originate in this central table land and run
radially into the sea. The central portion of the peninsula is character-
ized by low hills of coarse and shallow residual soils, underlain by porous
1/   This criteria was adopted by the Irrigation Commission (1972); the
coefficient of variability equals the standard deviation divided
by the mean.



- 9 -
disintegrated rock, alternatively with deeper clay loam or clay alluvial
basins. Along the Gulf of Cambay and the Arabian Sea, coastal alluvium
predominates while the soils along the Gulf of Kutch are sandy alluvium.
In the coastal areas, the water table is shallow and some localized areas of
salinity and high boron content occur. In recent years, over exploitation of
groundwater has resulted in an increasing problem of salt water intrusion
along the coast.
3.07      The Kutch land mass is crescent shaped, sloping towards the Great
Rann in the north and the Little Rann and the Bay of Kutch to the south. The
soils are generally derived from sandstones and limestones and are coarse in
texture with satisfactory internal drainage. Large areas are affected by
salinity and the Great and the Little Rann of Kutch are, without reclamation,
unsuitable for agricultural production.
Land Use
3.08      About 9.8 M ha (52% of the reporting area 1/ in the State) is under
cultivation. The forest area is only 1.6 M ha (8%) and cannot be reduced
further without disturbing the ecological balance. About 3.8 M ha (20%) are
either barren, uncultivable or put to non-agricultural uses. Officially,
cultivable waste land accounts for 2.2 M ha (12%), but most of this land is
located in Kutch and has--without irrigation--extremely low production poten-
tial. 2/ The remaining 1.4 M ha (8%) are either fallow or used as permanent
pastures and grazing land. Thus, in practice, there is little scope for in-
creasing the net cultivated area except through reclamation of desert, saline
and ravine areas.
3.09      The cropping intensity (107%) is one of the lowest in India.
However, this figure gives a somewhat misleading picture of the intensity of
land use, since almost one-fifth of the area is cultivated with two seasonal
or perennial crops. Given the low rainfall, the intensity of cultivation
cannot be significantly increased without irrigation. Further increases in
agricultural income are primarily dependent on continued yield increases in
rainfed areas, expansion of irrigation and shifts in the cropping pattern to
higher value crops.
Crops and Cropping Patterns
3.10      There are three cropping seasons in Gujarat:  kharif (June -
October), rabi (November - February), and hot weather (March - May). Most of
1/   Land use is reported for an area of 18.8 M ha while the official
estimate of the State's area is 19.6 M ha. Water bodies account
for a part of the difference between the two estimates, but the
difference is mainly due to incomplete coverage of the land use
surveys.
2/   Before 1970, about 1.4 M ha of cultivable waste land in Kutch was
classified as uncultivable.



- 10 -
the cropping is done during kharif utilizing the monsoon rainfall. In rabi,
crops are grown on residual soil moisture or with irrigation. Except in
limited areas with perennial irrigation no cultivation is done during the
hot weather season.
3.11      The climate and soils are suitable for cotton, groundnuts and
tobacco, and Gujarat produces about one-quarter of India's cotton and ground-
nuts and one-third of its tobacco. The area under tobacco (90,000 ha) is
small, but cotton and groundnuts are the most widely grown crops in the State,
each accounting for about 1.8 M or one-sixth of the cropped area.
3.12      Cereals--primarily pearl millet (1.7 M ha), sorghum (1.1 M ha),
wheat (0.7 M ha), paddy (0.5 M ha) and maize (0.3 M ha)--and pulses (0.4 M ha)
account for less than half the cropped area. As a result, Gujarat is seri-
ously deficient in foodgrains; in a normal year production is about 4.5
M tons compared to estimated requirements 1/ of 5.5 tons.
3.13      Pearl millet is the most important foodgrain, accounting for 30-35%
of total production. It is grown as a rainfed kharif crop throughout the
State, even though it is of lesser importance in the southern part. Since
Independence, yields have increased at an annual rate of 5.4% as a result of
successful research. Hybrid varieties were introduced in the mid-1960s and,
at present, two-thirds of the area is covered by these varieties. However,
since only 9% of the crop is irrigated the average yield remains relatively
low (0.8 tons/ha).
3.14      Sorghum is grown as a food and fodder crop throughout the State.
The kharif crop is almost without exception rainfed and the rabi crop is
mostly grown on residual soil moisture. Short season hybrid varieties are
available, but because of their relatively poor fodder value, they are
rarely used. Grain yields are extremely poor (0.4 tons/ha).
3.15      Wheat is the most popular rabi crop.  High yielding varieties were
introduced in 1967 and production has increased rapidly (8% p.a.). About
two-thirds of this increase was due to improved yields and one-third due to
expansion of the wheat area. One-third of the crop is grown on residual
soil moisture, especially in Ahmedabad and Kaira districts. Irrigated wheat,
which is grown throughout the State, yields about 2.2 tons/ha compared to
0.7 tons/ha for the unirrigated crop.
3.16      Irrigated paddy (accounting for one-third of the area) is usually
transplanted and gives an average yield of about 2.0 tons/ha. The rainfed
paddy, with a yield of about 1.2 tons/ha, is usually drilled. High yielding
varieties are primarily grown under irrigation. Wheat and coarse grains
are the staple food of the Gujarates. Since paddy requires much more water
than upland crops, paddy cultivation is concentrated in the southern part
of the State, where soils and climate are favorable.
1/   Assuming:  (i) a per capita requirement of 16 oz. (0.454 kg) per day;
and (ii) seed requirements and storage and transport losses amounting
to 10% of production.



- 11 -
3.17      Maize is grown in the eastern hill areas where it forms an impor-
tant component of the tribal diet. Like other kharif foodgrains, it is rarely
irrigated. However, hybrid varieties are gaining popularity and now account
for one-fifth of the area. The average rainfed yield (1.1 tons/ha) is higher
for maize than for any other foodgrains in the State.
3.18      Cotton is grown primarily in the central and northern parts of the
mainland and in the northern part of Saurashtra. Quality has received more
emphasis in cotton than in other crops; in the 1970s, short staple cotton
contributed nearly two-thirds of the total production while it now accounts
for less than one-fifth of the crop. Gujarat produces over 50% of India's
medium, 30% of long and 60% of extra-long staple cotton. Since Independence,
the area of irrigated cotton has increased twenty-fold, but still less than
one-quarter of the cropped area is irrigated. Over this period, yields have
increased at an average rate of 2.3% p.a. mainly due to the expansion of the
irrigated area. Research emphasis has been on yields without concern for
length of growing season, and thus, the 275 day varieties, developed in
Gujarat, are unsuitable for areas where irrigation water is scarce.
3.19      Groundnuts are primarily grown in Saurashtra under rainfed condi-
tions. The yield is highly influenced by the rainfall; in the drought year of
1972/73, the average yield was only 0.20 tons/ha while it reached 1.24 tons/ha
three years later. The crop is also affected by a number of diseases. This
makes groundnuts an extremely risky crop, and it has slowly lost ground since
the early 1960s.
3.20      Tobacco is concentrated in a small area in central Gujarat with
favorable climate and soils. Since it is a high value cash crop, cultivation
practices are well advanced and about half the crop is irrigated. Since the
early 1960s, yields have increased rapidly (by 4.6% p.a.) and are presently
about 1.5 tons/ha.
Agricultural Production Trends I/
3.21      The early years after independence were characterized by a rapid
acreage expansion; between 1950/51 and 1955/56, the cropped area increased
from 8.5 M ha to 9.5 M ha. Cotton accounted for half of this increase,
followed by groundnuts, wheat and pearl millet. In the period up to the
mid-1960s, the cropped area expanded much more slowly (by 0.6 M ha). However,
there were signficant changes in the cropping pattern. The groundnut area
more than doubled to somewhat over 2.0 M ha. This expansion took place
largely at the expense of the area under foodgrains (especially millets).
Combined with the expansion of the cultivated area and the shift towards
high value cash crops was a general yield increase. As a result, between
1952/53 and 1964/65, agricultural production grew faster in Gujarat than
in any other State.
1/   The trends in area, yield and production of major crops are given
in Annex 1, T4-T6.



- 12 -
3.22      Two factors changed the agricultural scene in the mid-1960s:
(i) the potential for an expansion of the net cultivated area had largely
been exhausted; and (ii) high yielding varieties for a number of foodgrains
were introduced on a large scale. Due to the close competition between
groundnuts and kharif foodgrains, the increased yield potential of especially
pearl millet meant that the area under this crop expanded, largely displacing
groundnuts. However, most spectacular was the doubling of wheat production
between 1965/66 and 1975/76. About two-thirds of this increase was due to
yield increases and one-third due to expansion of the area under wheat.
However, much of the transformation that was associated with the "green
revolution" took place between 1965/66 and 1970/71.
3.23      Largely because of favorable weather, agriculture reached a peak
in 1970/71 and this level has not been achieved since (i.e. up to 1976/77,
which is the latest year for which data is available). In recent years, many
of the "progress indicators" have been disturbing: fertilizer consumption
has remained relatively unchanged; the use of hybrid varieties of several
crops (especially cotton) has declined or remained constant; and the area
irrigated from groundwater has grown very slowly compared to the rapid ex-
pansion in the 1960s. There are a number of explanations of this mixed per-
formance: (i) the weather--1972/73 and 1974/75 were extreme drought years
and 1973/74 had less than normal rainfall; (ii) increased costs of fuel
affected the profitability of well irrigation; (iii) fertilizer prices were
drastically raised in 1975/76; and (iv) rapid changes in output prices--food-
grain prices boomed during 1973 and 1974 and fell during 1975 and 1976 while
groundnut and cotton prices also declined in 1975 but increased rapidly in
1976. The combination of changing absolute prices and changing relative
prices made crop planning extremely difficult for the farmers. The perceived
risks of droughts and falling prices reduced the incentive for private farm
investments as well as for use of fertilizers and high yielding varieties.
After the drought years, agricultural production recovered in 1975/76 and
1976/77, but it still remained below the 1970/71 level.
3.24      Even though the stagnation of recent years largely can be explained
by a combination of unfavorable exogenous factors, there are reasons to assume
that the easy benefits of the "green revolution" have already been reaped.
To regain the momentum, GOG's present plans give emphasis to:
(i) Strengthening the agricultural supporting services;
(ii)  Expansion of the canal irrigated area and improvements
to existing projects;
(iii) Scientific assessment of the groundwater resources and
enforcement of legislation of optimum use of the ground-
water potential;
(iv)  Strengthening of agricultural research with special focus
on drought and pest resistant high yielding varieties;



- 13 -
(v)  Shifts in the cropping pattern to higher value crops, for
example, replacing groundnuts with soybeans and hybrid castor;
and
(vi)  Development of improved dry farming techniques, with special
emphasis given to methods for soil moisture retention, and
expansion of the soil conservation program.
3.25      Given the past success of agricultural research in the State and
the well educated and progressive farmers, the prospects for a sustained high
growth rate of agricultural production are favorable.
Dairying
3.26      Animal husbandry and dairying provide important supplemental income
to many farmers in Gujarat. The Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producer's
Union, usually known as "Amul", is a model for dairy development in India.
Amul was started by a handful of members in 1948. At present, it comprises
794 primary societies with a total of 235,000 members. It processes some
600,000 liters of milk per day, largely for supply to Bombay, and its dairy
products are sold nationwide. Amul has been a powerful force in modernizing
the dairy industry; it maintains 580 artificial insemination centers, popu-
larizes green fodder cultivation and operates a cattle feed compounding
factory. Its economic impact is illustrated by a recent socio-economic
survey 1/ which showed that 56% of the incomes of farm households in the Kaira
District are derived from dairying. The success of Amul is being spread over
the State and, presently, there is a well established network of some 2,000
dairy cooperatives organized into 12 district unions.
Agricultural Supporting Services
3.27      Agricultural Research.  Since 1973, Gujarat Agricultural University
(GAU) has been responsible for agricultural research.  Its four campuses--
Anand, Dabtiwada, Junagadh and Navsari--are located in different agroclimatic
zones. The University has seven main research stations, specializing in dif-
ferent crops, and about 50 regional stations. In general, Gujarat's plant
breeding programs have been highly successful. In particular, the research
station at Jamnagar has achieved impressive results in the development of
hybrid pearl millet. Largely due to this research, the all-India yields of
pearl millet have increased faster than those of any other kharif crop. Sig-
nificant contributions have also been done in the development of long staple
hybrid cotton. Research on dry land farming technology and water management
has not achieved the same level of success as the plant breeding programs.
3.28       Research on irrigated agriculture is carried out on 15 trial-cum-
demonstration farms. The main focus of this research has been to determine
water requirements in relation to soil types, climate and critical stages of
1/   V. J. Vyas and N. J. Jodha, "Contribution of Dairying to Rural Economy
with Particular Reference to Small and Marginal Farmers", in Dairying

crop growth. So far, relatively little attention has been given to irrigation
practices and land development for irrigation. Results are mixed, as farmers
do not readily accept demonstrations under such controlled conditions which
they regard as not adaptable to their own farm. At the same time, many of
these farms do not have adequate staff and equipment to properly fulfill their
research function.
3.29      Agricultural Extension Services.  Technically, agricultural exten-
sion is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture (DA), however, the
primary contact with the farmers--the multipurpose Village Level Worker (VLW)--
belongs to the Department of Community Development. He works under the admin-
istrative control of the Taluka Development Officer and under the general
guidance of the Taluka Panchayat (an elected body). On technical matters,
there is a direct line of communication over the Agricultural Extension Officer
(at Taluka Level) and the District Agricultural Officer to DA. This dual line
of command, in combination with the VLW's multi-faceted tasks and low mobility,
has rendered the general extension system relatively ineffective.
3.30      In recent years, awareness of the disadvantages of the present
set-up has increased and GOG now plans to reorganize the extension service
in accordance with the "training and visit" system that has been implemented
in other States under a number of Bank Group financed projects. A pro-
posal for such a reorganization has recently been submitted to IDA and the
scheme is scheduled for appraisal in the summer of 1978, as part of a multi-
state project. The basic elements of the proposal are to:
(i)  Transfer the VLWs to DA;
(ii)  Strengthen applied agricultural research and
establish a better link between research and
extension; and
(iii)  Increase staff mobility at all levels.
Under the scheme, the VLW would work only on extension, covering 500 to 800
families, through a system of visiting groups of 80-100 farmers on a regular
basis every two weeks.
3.31      Agricultural Inputs.  There is a well developed system for distri-
bution and sale of seeds, fertilizers and pesticides throughout the State.
Certified seeds are produced both by the District Panchayats, under the
guidance of DA, and by the State Cooperative Marketing Federation. They are
distributed primarily through the cooperative marketing societies. Gujarat
is more than self-sufficient in the production of nitrogenous and phosphatic
fertilizers (the Gujarat State Fertilizer Corporation, a joint venture
between the GOG and the private sector is India's second largest manufacturer).
Fertilizers and pesticides are distributed through both cooperative marketing
societies and approved private retailers. There are about 6,000 distributors,
of which 5,000 are cooperatives, and inputs are usually available within easy
reach of the farmers.



- 15 -
3.32      Farm Mechanization.  There are now an estimated 12,000 tractors in
Gujarat or 1.2 tractors per 1,000 ha, which is below the national average.
Most of the tractors are owned by individual farmers but group ownership is
not uncommon. The Agro-Industries Corporation has recently established a net-
work of "Agro-Service Centers" which provide repair facilities for tractors
and implements and custom hiring services (at a rate of Rs 30 per hour for a
50 hp tractor). They also provide training facilities for mechanics and
drivers. The private sector, however, handles most of the sales and repairs
of tractors and implements.
3.33      Marketing and Processing.  With about half the area under cash
crops, Gujarat has a well developed system for agricultural marketing and
processing. Most of the trade is through regulated markets that serve a
specified area, usually within a 10 km radius. The 280 regulated markets
are under the control of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees. Some
30 markets have not yet been regulated, mainly due to resistance from vested
interests. Licensed traders are allowed to operate inside the service areas
of the regulated markets. Normally, these traders pay the same price--at
farm gate--as the farmers would get at the regulated market. About three-
quarters of the storage and processing facilites are owned by the private
sector with the remainder provided by the public and cooperative sectors.
In general, the present system for marketing and processing, which is highly
competitive, has responded quickly to increased output of both foodgrains
and cash crops.
3.34      Agricultural Credit.  The organization for institutional credit
to farmers follows the normal pattern in India. The cooperative banks, which
provide short (up to one year) and medium-term (one to five years) credit at
an interest rate of about 13%, are organized on a three tier basis with the
Gujarat State Cooperative Bank at the State level, 18 central cooperative
banks at the district level, and 8,700 primary cooperative credit societies
at the village level. The cooperative movement has always been strong in
Gujarat and about 80% of the farmers are members. The State Cooperative
Land Development Banks (SLDB) with about one million members, has 182
branches. It provides long-term (up to 15 years) loans at an interest rate
of about 11%. Commercial Banks, which provide all three types of credit,
have, since 1969, rapidly expanded their lending for agricultural purposes,
and they now account for about 15% of all loans to farmers. Private money
lenders play a relatively minor role.
IV. THE IRRIGATION SUB-SECTOR
Need for Irrigation
4.01      As noted earlier (paras. 3.03-3.04), Gujarat is characterized by
a low and unreliable rainfall. Based on both the amount of rainfall and
its variability, GOG has assessed the need for irrigation as follows:



- 16 -
Annual           Coefficient of       Irrigation            Percent
Rainfall           Variability            Needs              of Area
less than 500 mm         over 60%           Exceptionally high    16%
less than 500 mm          40-60%            Very high              21%
500 - 1,000 mm            40-60%            High                   26%
500 - 1,000 mm            20-40%            Moderate               26%
1,000 - 2,000 mm          20-40%            Moderately low         10%
over 2,000 mm             20-40%            Low                     1%
4.02      According to this classification, Kutch, with an annual rainfall of
250 mm to 400 mm, has a very high to exceptionally high need for irrigation
(Map 13202). In Saurashtra, the rainfall is higher (400 - 700 mm) and more
reliable, and the need ranges from moderate in the eastern part to very high
along the Bay of Kutch. On the Gujarat mainland, with rainfall ranging
between 500 mm and 2,000 mm, the need for irrigation decreases from very
high in parts of Banaskantha District in the north to low in parts of Bulsar
District in the south. However, farms in the southern and central parts of
the mainland are small (para 2.11) and farm incomes are well below the State
average (paras 2.08-2.09). Thus, from an income distributional point of view,
irrigation development in these parts of the State deserves a high priority.
Water Resources and Irrigation Potential
4.03      The distribution of Gujarat's water resources are heavily con-
centrated in the southern and central parts of the main and.  Three major3
rivers (Narmada, with a mean annual runoff of 44,300 Mm ; Tapi, 19,700 Mm
and Mahi 11,800 Mm') flow through this area which has a relatively high rain-
fall. The northern mainland, Saurashtra and Kutch, with high to exceptionally
high needs for irrigation have limited surface and groundwater resources.
3
4.04      The State's groundwater resou ces are about 10,000 Mm  1/ and the
surface water resources about 82,000 Mm . 2/ However, the potential for
development of the surface resources is limited by a number of factors:
(i) All the rivers, except the Narmada and the Tapi, are
seasonal and more than 90% of the total flow occurs
during the June - September monsoon when the need for
irrigation is the lowest;

and Power, New Delhi, 1972.



- 17 -
(ii)  The topography is not conducive to the construction of
large dams, and especially in Saurashtra and Kutch, the
damsites are costly to develop; and
(iii) The Narmada, Tapi and Mahi rivers all have the major part
of their catchments in other States and the availability
of water for Gujarat depends largely on agreements with
the upper riparian States. Such an agreement has not
yet been reached for the Narmada, but a tribunal is
presently considering the allocation of its water
between Madhya Pradesh, Maharasthra and Gujarat.
The tribunal's award is expected within two years.
4.05      Taking these constraints into account, the available water resources,
excluding Narmada, and the present utilization of irrigation water are esti-
mated as follows:

ment, Ahmedabad.

4.06      Statewide, about 64% of the groundwater resources have already been
developed. The discussion of Gujarat's irrigation potential in the Irrigation
Commission's Report (1972) indicates that the award of the Narmada Tribunal is
likely to increase potential water resources by 50% or more. However, it is
likely that it will take two or three decades before the Narmada Scheme can be
fully developed.
Past Development
4.07      General Trends.  In 1950, the irrigated area in Gujarat was only
about 0.46 M ha (5% of the cropped area), almost exclusively served from
wells. A number of irrigation projects were started in the 1950s, but



- 18 -
implementation was slow, and not until the early 1960s did the development
of surface irrigation accelerate. The private development of groundwater
was much more rapid and accounted for two-thirds of the increase in the
net irrigated area between 1950/51 and 1975/76 as shown below:

/a   The results from the 1970/71 agricultural census indicate that the
area irrigated, according to official statistics, from major and
medium schemes might be over-estimated by 50-60% and from ground-
water by about 30%. The adjusted estimate assumed that: (i) the
census figures are correct and (ii) the relative error in the agri-
cultural official statistics has remained unchanged since 1970/71.
4.08      According to official statistics, about 15% of the cropped area
(1.58 M ha) is presently irrigated. This figure is less than two-thirds
of the national average, and only two States (Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra)
have a lower percentage of its cropped area irrigated. Wheat and cotton have
accounted for most of the expansion of the irrigated area since Independence.
The general trends in irrigation of major crops are:

4.09      Surface Irrigation Projects (Map 13257).  At Independence, there
were only two small canal systems in Gujarat, both of which dated back to
the nineteenth century. A major reason for the almost complete lack of
irrigation projects was that Saurashtra, which combines a high need for
irrigation with a reasonable potential, consisted of about 200 Princely
States. Their technical and financial resources were limited and even minor
schemes created conflicts over riparian rights. Moreover, the alluvial plains
of mainland Gujarat did not offer easily developed damsites.
4.10       In the early 1950s, three major schemes were started:  Mahi Right
Bank Canal (RBC) with a cultivable command area (CCA) of about 143,000 ha;
Kakrapar, CCA of about 225,000 ha; and Shetrunji, CCA of about 57,000 ha.
Mahi and Kakrapar are both diversion schemes, while Shetrunji has a dam for
storage of monsoon flow for use in the rabi and hot weather seasons. On all
three projects, progress of dam/weir construction was relatively rapid but
canal construction lagged far behind. The Bank Group's first loan or credit
for irrigation development in India financed the construction of Shetrunji's
canal system (Credit No. 13-IN, 1961, US$4.5 M). Like other Indian irrigation
projects financed by the Bank Group at about the same time, the Shetrunji
project failed to achieve its agricultural potential due to inadequate agri-
cultural supporting services and lagging construction of field channels and
drains by the farmers. These problems have lead GOI, the State Governments
and the Bank Group to adopt a more integrated approach to irrigation develop-
ment rather than focus only on construction of dams and canals (para. 1.10).
4.11      Based on these experiences, the Kadana Irrigation Project (Credit
No. 176-IN, 1970, US$35.0 M) was the first of a second generation of Bank
Group financed irrigation projects in India. It included: (i) a dam across
the Mahi River mainly to provide storage for the Mahi RBC; (ii) construction
of a Left Bank Canal (LBC) with a CCA of 20,000 ha; (iii) extension of the
Mahi RBC to serve 263,000 ha; (iv) construction of field channels, drains and
landshaping and financing of these works through institutional credit; (v)
construction of market roads; and (vi) an agricultural support program. The
Kadana project is now basically completed, about two years behind schedule
due to two extreme floods which seriously disrupted dam construction. A
Project Completion Report is scheduled for late 1978.
4.12      The Ukai project was started in 1960 to provide carry-over storage
for the Kakrapar project and to extend the CCA to cover a total of about
375,000 ha. Up to 1977, an irrigation potential of 314,000 ha had been
created, but only about 146,000 ha were actually irrigated. The canal system,
especially in the old Kakrapar part, was not designed to meet the exacting
requirements of modern high yielding varieties and inadequate drainage has
created problems of waterlogging. The GOG is presently undertaking a major
program of on-farm development, drainage and modernization works in the
Ukai-Kakrapar command. Command area development (see para. 1.10) is also
in progress in the Shetrunji and Mahi-Kadana areas.
4.13      While the State's major irrigation works are concentrated on the
Gujarat mainland--only Shetrunji is located in Saurashtra and no major pro-
ject is located in Kutch--the about 50 completed medium irrigation projects



- 20 -
(MIPs) are located in all parts of the State. The dry areas of Kutch and
Saurashtra have been given priority in the construction of MIPs. However,
because of the limited water resources in Kutch, only a few medium projects
have been built there.
4.14      Typically, tanks for storage of local runoff during the monsoon
provide only supplementary irrigation during the kharif season and the area
irrigated varies substantially from year to year. The district panchayats
are responsible for the construction--with the assistance of the Public Works
Department's Irrigation Wing--and the maintenance of tanks and other minor
irrigation projects. Due to the large variations in monsoon rainfall and
poor maintenance, the water supply from these projects is unreliable, and
they have lower priority than major and medium projects. The exception is
the low rainfall areas of the State where there are few possibilities for
larger projects and where important social benefits can be derived from
minor irrigation projects.
4.15      Groundwater.  For centuries, Gujarat farmers have used wells for
irrigation. At Independence, the well irrigated area in the State was 0.40 M
ha. During the 1950s, the well irrigated area increased at an annual rate of
about 3.5%, mainly due to the sinking of new wells. In the 1960s, the pace of
development almost doubled and traditional lift methods such as Persian wheels,
poise lifts and rope-buckets were rapidly replaced by pumps driven by diesel
engines. In several areas, the limit of groundwater resources is now being
approached and the overall pace of development is slowing down. At present,
there are some 700,000 wells, over half of which are equipped with pumpsets,
and about 2,500 tubewells.
4.16      In the hard rock areas of Saurashtra, large diameter open dugwells
must be used. These wells depend on rains for annual recharge and the well
discharge varies substantially over the year. In years with low rainfall,
many of the wells are almost completely dry. In the alluvial areas, dug-cum-
bore wells are usually used. They are a development of the open dug well in
that a boring of about 15 cm diameter is sunk in the bottom of the dug well
in order to increase the flow. These borings may be as deep as a hundred
meters. A dug-cum-bore well in alluvium typically has three times as large
capacity as a dug well in hard rock areas, and the discharge is much more
reliable. Most of the tubewells are located in the northern part of the
Gujarat mainland with deep alluvial soils. Public tubewells--slightly over
half of all tubewells--are constructed by the Gujarat Water Resources Devel-
opment Corporation but are operated and maintained by the district panchayats.
Private tubewells are often owned by a group of farmers.
4.17      Investigations of groundwater potential and the establishment of well
spacing criteria are the responsibility of the State Groundwater Directorate.
Gujarat is, so far, the only Indian State that has passed groundwater legisla-
tion, but it has not yet become effective. In the meantime, GOG relies on
lending institutions for the--partial--enforcement of well spacing criteria.



- 21 -
4.18      IDA has supported the development of groundwater in the State
through the Gujarat Agricultural Credit project (Credit No. 191-IN, 1970,
US$35.0 M). This project financed, inter alia, construction of about
41,000 wells and about 450 tubewells, and installation of about 45,000
pumpsets.
Past Performance of Major and Medium Irrigation Projects
4.19      Since Independence, the average cost for major and medium irrigation
projects in Gujarat has been about Rs 10,500 per ha of "irrigation potential
created", which is about 50% higher than the national average. The higher
cost can, to a large extent, be explained by a relative lack of good damsites.
However, the actual utilization of the irrigation potential is significantly
lower in Gujarat resulting in a cost of about Rs 15,000 per irrigated ha,
or almost twice the national average. Given the present level of irrigated
yields, it is likely that the direct economic returns from past irrigation
investments in Gujarat have been both lower than the "national average"
and lower than the opportunity cost of capital. On the other hand, the
indirect economic and social benefits of irrigation in this drought prone
state are considerable.
4.20      Outstanding among the reasons for underutilization of existing
major and medium projects are:
(a) The hydrological data base is typically poor which results
in over-or-under-design of the dam and the irrigation net-
work in relation to the water de facto available.
(b) Many of the projects are run-of-the-river schemes supplied
from a diversion weir. Large variations of the river flows
make the water supply unreliable and usually the potential
for rabi irrigation is limited.
(c) Water losses in the conveyance system and on fields are
grossly underestimated at the design stage resulting in
the area actually irrigated being considerably smaller
than the area commanded by the distribution system.
(d) The water conveyance systems, especially in medium projects,
are incomplete at the farm level. Water is presently sup-
plied through outlets serving 40 ha blocks, and the farmers
are expected to construct watercourses and field channels
within the blocks. However, with few exceptions, there
are no effective organizations to help the farmers with
the design, implementation and financing of these works.
Consequently, the few channels that exist have been
poorly constructed resulting in both excessive water
losses and unreliable supply to the individual farms.
(e) Inadequate water allocation procedures. For the highest
yields, the farmers should plant most irrigated kharif crops



- 22 -
in June, but the approval of their water applications comes
only after the reservoir has started to fill up in mid-July.
This usually results in too late a planting date, especially
if the application is rejected and the crop has to be grown
under rainfed conditions. Being "risk minimizers", the
farmers plant with the first monsoon rains in the later
part of June and go for a "low technology package" under
the assumption that they might not get any irrigation water.
Only in the case of drought during the later stages of the
crop will they apply for water. Thus, in normal years, the
potential for kharif irrigation remains largely unutilized.
(f) The farmers are poorly trained in irrigated crop management
which leads to a wasteful use of water on the field. 1/
Project Formulation
4.21      Expansion of the irrigated area is one of the cornerstones in
Gujarat's agricultural development strategy. Because of the limited scope
for groundwater development, GOG gives high priority to surface irrigation.
In per capita terms, the investment rate is almost twice the national average.
Annual capital expenditures, in constant 1977/78 terms, rose from Rs 160 M
during the First Five Year Plan (1951-56) to Rs 431 M during the Fourth Plan
(1969-74) and are expected to reach Rs 727 M in 1977/78.
4.22      The plans for the next five year period emphasize:
(a)  The completion of all on-going major and medium
projects in order to minimize the gestation period
and get a more rapid buildup of irrigation benefits;
(b)  Construction of new medium projects, especially in
drought prone and backward areas;
(c)  Start on the Narmada scheme 2/; and
1/   A project for reorganization of the State's agricultural extension
service and research is presently under preparation for possible
Bank financing in early FY79.
2/   The award of the Narmada Water Tribunal is crucial for both GOG's
investment program for the 1978-1984 period and for its long-
term development strategy; the former is largely determined by
the timing of the award and the latter by the total quantities
of water allocated. If the award is delayed beyond 1979, it is
likely that the investments in major and medium projects will
be increased but the total irrigation investments are reduced
to a slightly lower level. Once the award is given, GOG intends
to prepare a comprehensive perspective plan for the development
of the State's water resources.

(d) Modernization of existing projects, primarily through
the provision of additional control structure, canal
lining and construction of watercourses/field channels.
4.23      In constant 1977/78 terms, the investments envisaged for the 1978/79-
1982/84 period are:

the advance plan assistance has averaged about Rs 150 M per year.
4.24      Within the constraints imposed by the State's limited surface water
resources, this represents a well formulated investment program. It balances
short gestation, high yielding investments in medium irrigation projects,
completion of major projects and modernization of existing medium and major
projects with the need for a continuous long-term expansion of the irrigated
area through the start of the Narmada project. By the later part of the
1980s, when it is likely that the first areas will be irrigated from the
Narmada Project, virtually all surface water resources outside the Narmada
basin will have been fully developed. In the formulation of the program, a
high weight has also been given to the needs of drought prone and backward
areas.
4.25      The proposed credit would support GOG's irrigation program and
have the following objectives:
(a) achieve a more economic use of scarce surface water
resources;
(b) ensure a reliable irrigation supply to individual
farmers;
(c) spread irrigation to areas where large scale development
is not feasible;
(d) strengthen GOG's project preparation; and
(e) further build up and consolidate GOI's capability to
appraise irrigation projects.



- 24 -
4.26      To achieve these objectives, the proposed credit would finance,
over the 1978/79 - 1982/83 period, the construction of new medium irrigation
projects (MIPs) and the modernization of existing MIPs. All MIPs that meet
technical and economic criteria agreed between GOI, GOG and IDA (see paras.
5.03 - 5.09) would be eligible for financing under the credit. Most important
among the criteria are full lining of the canals and extension of the system
to serve 8 ha blocks instead of the traditional 40 ha blocks. It is estimated
that about one-third of the approximately 30 on-going MIPs under construction
would be modified to meet these criteria and that about ten new MIPs de-
signed specifically to meet the criteria would be started under the credit.
Together, these projects would account for about three-quarters of GOG's total
expenditures for the construction of MIPs over the next five years. The
modernization works, which would be eligible for IDA financing, would bring
about five existing projects up to the same technical standards as have been
agreed for new MIPs. In view of the large number of MIPs involved, appraisal
and progress review by IDA of individual MIPs would not be practical. Instead,
this would be carried out by the recently established Appraisal Committee (AC)
of GOI's Central Water Commission (CWC) (paras. 6.05-6.07). The procedures
for sub-project preparation, appraisal and progress review (paras 6.08-6.17)
would conform to those established for the Orissa Irrigation Project (Credit
No. 740-IN, 1977, US$58.0 M).
4.27      This procedure would also enable IDA to review in depth and get
fully involved in a large part of Gujarat's irrigation sector and to make a
major impact, Statewide, on technical and economic standards applied to all
irrigation projects.  The GOG has become increasingly aware of the shortcomings
of existing projects and the proposed technical criteria for the new MIPs were
worked out jointly during IDA appraisal of the proposed credit. Subsequent to
the appraisal, GOG has decided to apply the same technical standards to most
medium irrigation projects and is considering to introduce them in the major
projects.
V. THE SECTOR CREDIT
General
5.01      The proposed credit would finance:
(a) Construction, over a five year period, of medium irrigation
projects, covering about 63,000 ha throughout the State;
(b) Modernization of existing medium irrigation projects, cover-
ing about 55,000 ha in order to bring them up to the technical
standards agreed with IDA for new projects;
(c) A network of automatic discharge measuring stations to improve
the hydrological data base for the planning of future major
and medium projects; and
(d) Monitoring and evaluation studies.

Medium Irrigaton Projects
5.02      Under the proposed credit, medium irrigation projects (MIPs)
would encompass cultivable command areas of 2,000 to 30,000 ha. Each
MIP would generally be composed of:
(a) an earthfill storage dam with a gated spillway;
(b) a fully lined canal network which would deliver water
through outlets serving 8 ha blocks; and
(c) a drainage network connected to natural drains.
Typically, about 80%-90% of the command area would be irrigated in kharif
and 30%-60% in rabi. The average cost would be about Rs 15,000 (US$1,740)
per ha of cultivable command area, ranging from about Rs 12,000 (US$1,400) to
Rs 18,000 (US$2,090). Normally, the dam accounts for two-thirds of the cost
of an MIP and the conveyance and drainage networks together for about one-
third. This is significantly higher than the cost of about Rs 10,000
(US$1,160) per ha for major irrigation schemes designed to similar standards. 1/
However, MIPs have shorter gestation periods and thus, yield quicker benefits.
Salient features and the cost breakdown for a typical MIP are described in
Annex 1, T7.
Criteria for Medium Irrigation Projects
5.03      Basic data requirements, specific criteria for planning, design and
construction, and a minimum level of economic viability have been established
for MIPs eligible for disbursement under the credit. An agreement has been
reached with GOI and GOG that MIPs financed under the IDA credit would be de-
signed, constructed and completed in accordance with these requirements and
criteria which are detailed in the Implementation Report and summarized below:
5.04      Basic Data Requirements:   (i) a land classification map based on a
soil survey; (ii) an agro-economic survey to provide a basis for future agri-
cultural, social and economic development planning; (iii) rainfall records
in or near the project area for a minimum of 20 years; (iv) a 20 year estimate
of monthly runoff based, to the extent possible, on streamflow measurements
with current meters correlated with observed rainfall data; and (v) sediment
samples at or near each damsite for determination of expected sediment levels
in the reservoir.
5.05      Water Requirements and Reservoir Operation Studies:  (i) the modi-
fied Penman method should be used to estimate crop water requirements;
(ii) water requirements for paddy would include allowance for land preparation
1/   The distribution networks are slighlty costlier in major projects,
but this is more than offset by the economies of scale in dam
construction; the per ha cost of dams is significantly lower than in
MIPs. Generally, the dam accounts for one-third and the distribution
network for two-thirds of the cost in major projects.

and percolation; (iii) assumed field irrigation efficiencies would not be
greater than 90% for paddy and 70% for diversified (upland) crops; (iv) assumed
canal conveyance efficiencies would not exceed 75%; (v) the size of the command
area and the live storage capacity of the reservoir would be such that full
kharif irrigation requirements would be met in 15 years out of 20; (vi) the
average area to be irrigated in rabi would be established through a 20-year
reservoir operation study; and (vii) sediment for a minimum period of 50 years
would be considered for determining the diversion elevation from the reservoir.
5.06      Design Criteria:  (i) the canal system would be fully lined; (ii)
regulated outlets with a capacity of about one cusec would serve irrigable
areas no larger than 8 ha on the average; (iii) minor canals would be designed
for rotational (warabundi) irrigation; (iv) the main canal system would be
designed with the necessary structures to permit full irrigation deliveries to
all commanded areas when flows are less than 50% of capacity; (v) structures
for measurement of water flows would be provided from the head of the main
canal down to and including each minor; and (vi) an emergency spillway for the
reservoir would be provided wherever favorable topographical and geological
conditions exist.
5.07      Construction:  (i) all land would be properly prepared for irriga-
tion prior to the delivery of water; (ii) canal embankments and the invert,
when the invert is in fill, would be mechanically compacted; (iii) earthfill
around structures would be compacted; (iv) minors and sub-minors would be
thoroughly saturated before lining; (v) construction of each project would be
completed within five years; and (vi) construction of water courses and field
channels and, where required, land shaping would be started before the release
of water.
5.08      Cost Estimates:  (i) cost estimates would be based on bid prices
prevailing in the project area at the time of appraisal; (ii) cost estimates
would include: a physical contingency factor of not less than 20% for
feasibility grade estimates and costs for administration, design and super-
vision (normally about 15% of construction cost), land acquisition, and
resettlement of families displaced by the project.
5.09      Economic Criteria:  (i) individual MIPs would have a benefit-cost
ratio exceeding 1.0 based on annual net benefits and investment costs dis-
counted at a 12% interest rate; (ii) the benefit-cost ratio would be estab-
lished by using techniques set out in the "form for establishing the economic
viability of medium irrigation projects" (Annex 1, T20); (iii) financial cost
of land acquisition would be excluded; (iv) the agricultural production lost
on lands flooded by the reservoir or used for canals would explicitly be
taken into account in the estimation of the benefit-cost ratio; and (v) cost
of land clearing and shaping on presently uncultivated land would be included.
Modernization of Medium Irrigation Projects
5.10      In view of the deficiencies of existing irrigation projects, GOG
has started a program to modernize both major and medium projects, primarily
through lining of main canals and distributaries. Under the proposed credit,



- 27 -
existing MIPs would be improved to the same technical standards as those
adopted for new MIPs (paras. 5.03-5.09).  The principle items of work would
be: (i) to extend the canal system down to regulated outlets serving 8 ha,
on the average; (ii) lining of the whole canal system; (iii) additional con-
trol structures to enable a better regulation of the water deliveries; and
(iv) local drainage works.  The cost for the improvements is estimated at
Rs 4,000 per ha.
River Gauging Network
5.11      At present, river gauging is done through float measurements usually
taken twice a day. Most of the rivers in Gujarat are flashy; they reach their
peak a few hours after a heavy rainfall and subside quickly. Under these
circumstances, accurate flow measurements can be done only through a conti-
nuous monitoring 24 hours a day. In order to improve the hydrological data
base for the planning of future major and medium irrigation projects, a net-
work of automatic river stage recorders would be installed throughout the
State. Consulting services (five man-months) vehicles, current meters and
associated equipment would be provided together with installations for river
stage recorders (Annex 1, T8 & T9).
Monitoring and Evaluation of Project Performance
5.12      There would be a need to monitor and evaluate the costs and bene-
fits associated with the improved design and construction standards introduced
under the credit. For this purpose: (i) PWD would monitor canal/conveyance
efficiencies in selected projects undergoing modernization and make a compara-
tive study of conveyance losses in unlined and lined canal systems; (ii) DA
with the assistance of GAU and in cooperation with PWD would assess the bene-
fits resulting from the reduction of the outlet blocks from 40 ha to 8 ha,
in terms of both water savings and agricultural benefits; and (iii) an in-
dependent economic research institute would prepare an evaluation of MIPs
financed under the credit, utilizing, inter alia, the bench mark agro-economic
surveys (para 5.04), CWC progress reports and evaluation reports prepared by
PWD and DA on the studies under item (i) and (ii). These studies would form
the basis for a project completion report prepared by GOG. Technical services
and some minor equipment would be provided for this purpose. (The equipment
required for monitoring of canal losses is included in Annex 1, T9.)
Cost Estimates
5.13      The proposed credit would support a five year time-slice of
Gujarat's medium irrigation program which is projected to amount to about
Rs 1,313.4 M (para 4.23). The IDA credit would finance all expenditures on
MIPs, designed and constructed in accordance with the agreed criteria (paras
5.03-5.09), during the 1978/79-1982/83 period. Ongoing MIPs and MIPs started
in 1978/79 would be completed under the credit while MIPs started 1979/80 or
later would only be financed up to 1982/83. However any MIP started under the
credit would be completed in accordance with the agreed criteria (para 5.03).
The five-year expenditures on MIPs that meet the criteria are estimated at
Rs 947.8 M, of which about one-quarter would be for completion of on-going



- 28 -
and three-quarters for new MIPs.  The funds provided would enable the full
development of about 63,000 ha.
5.14      The irrigation and drainage networks would be improved on a total
of about 55,000 ha. The cost of these modernization works is estimated at
about Rs 4,000 per ha, including physical contingencies (about 20%) and
administration, engineering and supervision (about 15%). The cost of river
gauging, and monitoring and evaluation studies are estimated at Rs 6.9 M and
Rs 2.0 M, respectively.
5.15      Total project cost would be about Rs 1,466.3 M (US$170.5 M), with
a foreign exchange component of Rs 243.4 M (US$28.3 M), or about 17% of the
total cost. Taxes and duties are insignificant and, therefore, not included.
Price contingencies have been estimated at about 25% of base cost (Annex 1,
T10).

Financing
5.16       The proposed IDA credit of US$85.0 M would finance the foreign
exchange component (US$28.3 M) and about 40% of local cost or about 50% of
total project cost. All infrastructure works would be financed from GOG's
development budget, which would include a GOI contribution. The credit would
be made to GOI on standard terms. An agreement has been reached that GOI
would make the proceeds of the credit available to GOG on GOI's standard
terms and arrangements for development assistance to the States.
5.17      GOI and the State governments are presently adopting a system of
"rolling" five year plans which provide the framework for the present annual
development plans. The rolling plans will be updated each year. This means
that only the investment program for the current year is known with certainty.
Consequently, an agreement was reached that GOG would promptly provide the
funds to implement and complete IDA-financed MIP works in accordance with the
schedule of expenditures (Annex 1, T10). IDA would annually exchange views with
GOG on the implementation program for construction and modernization of MIPs.

Procurement
5.18      Construction of Medium Irrigation Projects (US$93.2 M) 1/.  Civil
works would be restricted to seasonal construction and would be carried out
through labor-intensive methods. Works would be relatively small and
scattered throughout the State. Consequently, it would neither be feasible
nor economic to group them into large contracts for international competitive
bidding (ICB). Present practice of GOG for ongoing MIPs is to award most of
the construction works for dams, spillways and main canals after local com-
petitive bidding (LCB), and this practice would be followed under the proposed
credit. Gujarat has a well developed construction industry and the procedures
for LCB are satisfactory. Some of the minor works would be awarded under
small unit price contracts. Force account would be used only when required
by safety or quality considerations, and would be limited to a maximum of
10% of all civil works.
5.19      Modernization of Medium Irrigation Projects (US$21.8 M) 2/.  These
works would be highly labor-intensive and be scheduled intermittently in order
to fit into the irrigation program. They would be tendered on the basis of
well proven piece work type contracts. These contracts, with their inbuilt
flexibility, would be the only appropriate method of constructing small
scattered works to ensure minimum interruption of irrigation service in the
ongoing projects.
5.20      Vehicles and Equipment (US$ 300,000).  The stream gauging equipment
would consist of small off-the-shelf items costing less than US$100,000 for
each order. The field vehicles would depend on existing servicing and spare
part facilities. These items would not be suitable for ICB and would be pro-
cured through standard GOG procedures which are satisfactory.
Disbursements
5.21      Disbursements would be made for:  (i) 100% of the foreign expendi-
tures for directly imported equipment; (ii) 100% for locally manufactured
goods procured ex-factory; (iii) 70% for other locally procured goods; (iv)
100% for technical services; and (v) 60% of expenditures for civil works on
approved MIPs. Disbursements for force account work and for payments of less
than Rs 100,000 under civil works contracts and Rs 50,000 for equipment and
vehicles would be made against certificates of expenditure--itemized by sub-
project--submitted by GOG. Documentation for these works would be retained
by GOG and made available for inspection by IDA during review missions.  Full
documentation would be required for all other disbursements. The estimated
schedule of expenditure, the proposed allocation of the proceeds of the credit
and the semi-annual disbursement schedule are presented in Annex 1, Tll & T12.
It is expected that disbursements would be completed by June 1984.

Accounts and Audits
5.22      The Public Works Department (PWD) would be subject to normal Govern-
ment control and auditing procedures which are satisfactory. Agreements have
been reached with GOG that: (i) it would maintain separate accounts on project
expenditures (in the case of construction and modernization of MIPs, accounts
would be maintained for each sub-project); (ii) these accounts would be
audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; (iii) audit
summaries would be submitted to IDA within nine months from the end of each
fiscal year together with the auditor's reports; and (iv) complete accounts
and financial statements would be made available for inspection during IDA
review missions.
Environmental Effects
5.23      The main water-related diseases in Gujarat are malaria and typhoid.
The construction of drainage facilities and the lining of canals would
minimize areas of stagnating water which are suitable breeding grounds for
mosquitoes. Also, borrow pits excavated in the course of project implemen-
tation would be drained. Under these conditions, it is not expected that
the incidence of malaria and typhoid would increase due to project works.
However, an agreement has been reached with GOG that it would take all mea-
sures as considered necessary to minimize the hazards of malaria and other
water-related diseases in areas covered by MIPs financed under the credit.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
The Irrigation Wing of Gujarat Public Works Department (PWD)
6.01      The direct responsibility for planning, implementation, operation
and maintenance of the MIPs would rest with the Irrigation Wing of PWD. 1/
The Irrigation Wing, which has a sufficient staff of well trained engineers
to meet the increased workload under the credit, is organized into four
branches, each headed by a Chief Engineer who works under the guidance of
the Special Secretary, Irrigation:
(a) the Irrigation Projects (IP) Branch is responsible
for the planning, design and construction of all
major and medium projects in the State with the
exception of Kadana and Narmada.
(b) The Kadana Branch was set up for the design and con-
struction of the IDA financed Kadana Irrigation
Project (Credit No. 176-IN) and for the Panam Project.
1/   The PWD has two other wings; one for the construction and maintenance
of Government buildings and major roads and one for electrical instal-
lations in buildings.



- 31 -
(c) The Narmada Branch is responsible for the planning and
construction of the Narmada Project.
(d) The Irrigation (I) Branch operates all major and medium
irrigation projects. It also assists the district
Panchayats in the design and construction of minor
irrigation projects.
6.02      The IP-Branch is organized along both functional and geographical
lines. The Water Resources Investigation Circle (WRI), headed by a Super-
intending Engineer (SE), is responsible for the hydrological, geological and
soil surveys and the preliminary design of all major and medium projects. In
order to provide basic data for irrigation planning purposes, it maintains a
network of rainfall and river discharge gauging stations and carries out in-
depth studies of selected river basins in the State. The Central Designs
Organization (CDO), with three SEs, prepares detailed designs of earth and
masonry dams and major canal structures. It lays down design standards and
provides typical designs for minor canals and canal structures to the con-
struction circles. The CDO has a special unit that also assists the con-
struction circles in computerized PERT planning for all projects. Model
studies for the design of irrigation projects are carried out by GOG's
Engineering Research Institute (ERI) in Baroda and by GOI's Central Water and
Power Research Station in Poona, Maharashtra. In 1977, a Project Preparation
and Monitoring Cell (PPM), with a multidisciplinary staff was established in
order to better integrate agricultural development aspects in the planning of
irrigation projects.
6.03      The Irrigation Wing's construction organization is flexible and
adjusted to the implementation program. With the exception of Narmada,
Kadana and Panam, the responsibility for construction of medium and major
projects rests with the four Irrigation Project Circles that report to
the Chief Engineer (IP). Each circle is headed by a SE and handles a work
program of US$5-10 M annually. All designs of canals and minor canal struc-
tures for the circle are prepared by a design office directly under the SE.
Typically, the circle consists of 4-6 divisions, headed by Executive Engineers
(EEs), and about 25 sub-divisions. For a typical 10,000 ha project, three
sub-divisions are created; one for dam construction, one for construction of
the canal and drainage networks and one for planning and quality control.
Testing of construction materials is carried out by ERI. The sub-divisions
are headed by Deputy Engineers.
6.04      The I-Branch of PWD has four irrigation circles that are responsible
for the O&M of irrigation projects within specific geographical areas. As in
the case of the IP circles, the irrigation circles are headed by a SE and con-
sist of 4-6 divisions and about 25 sub-divisions.  The I-Branch also has one
circle for the construction of field channels, one circle for assistance to
the district panchayats in design and construction of minor irrigation pro-
jects. The director of PWD's Staff Training and College reports to the Chief
Engineer (I).

The Appraisal Committee of the Central Water Commission
6.05      The Central Water Commission (CWC) of GOI is the highest technical
authority for water resources development in India. The Commission consists
of a Chairman and four members. It has a staff of more than 1,000 engineers.
A large part of the staff is on rotation from the States.
6.06      The CWC prepares guidelines for the design and construction of
irrigation projects and is responsible for technical review of all major
and medium projects before they are submitted for approval by the Planning
Commission of GOI. In the case of medium irrigation projects, the review
is only proforma, while major irrigation projects are analyzed in detail.
The CWC usually is actively involved in the planning of large projects of
high national importance. Recently, CWC established a Central Monitoring
Organization, which continuously follows the implementation of selected major
projects. The CWC is also sometimes directly responsible for the planning
and implementation of federally sponsored schemes.
6.07      The CWC would be responsible for appraising and reviewing the
progress of MIPs financed from the credit. In connection with the Orissa
Irrigation Project (Credit 740-IN), CWC established an Appraisal Committee
(AC) for this purpose. The AC is headed by a Chief Engineer who reports to
the Member, Planning and Progress, of CWC. The committee's staff presently
consists of a director, six engineers, two agriculturalists and one economist.
The AC has completed appraisal of three MIPs in Orissa and has recently sub-
mitted the Project Summaries (para. 6.13) to IDA for approval. 1/ The pro-
gress of CWC's appraisal and review work has been satisfactory. During
implementation of the proposed sector credit, the workload of AC would in-
crease and, thus, CWC would gradually increase AC's staff based on the follow-
ing man-power coefficients: 24-32 man-weeks per MIP appraisal and 18 man-weeks
per MIP per year for progress review during implementation. These man-power
coefficients would be reviewed and, if necessary, adjusted based on experience
gained during project implementation.
Procedures for Medium Irrigation Projects
6.08      There would be a continuous interaction between AC and GOG during
the implementation of MIPs. The main activities in the "project cycle" would
follow procedures described below.
6.09      Project Identification.  Potential MIPs are identified in the Per-
spective Plan of Gujarat 1974-1984. The initial investigations are carried
out by WRI which prepares a Preliminary Investigation report. This purely
engineering report, which gives an indication of the technical feasibility of
1/   Under the Orissa Irrigation Project, CWC is authorized to approve MIPs
costing less than Rs 70 M (the same "free limit" would also apply to
the proposed credit, see para 6.14). However, in order to establish
quality standards for CWC's appraisal work, the first three sub-projects

the project and outlines the requirements for detailed investigations, pro-
vides the basis for a decision about a full scale investigation program.
The investigation and preparation priorities of MIPs are established by the
CE (IP) after consultation with concerned GOG Departments.
6.10      Project Preparation.  Detailed hydrological, geological and soil
investigations are carried out by WRI and contour survey by the Survey of
India at the request of GOG. The WRI prepares a Project Report which includes
preliminary designs, cost estimates and a tentative implementation plan. An
agreement has been reached with GOG that a Project Preparation Committee
would be established for each MIP to be financed under the credit. This
Committee would be headed by the District Development Officer and have the EE
responsible for project preparation as convener and the Agronomist--Irrigated
Agriculture and district level officers from the Agriculture, Cooperative,
Revenue and Forestry Departments as members.
6.11      Subsequent to clearance by GOG technical and administrative depart-
ments, the Project Report is approved by CE (IP). Designs for earth and
masonry dams and major canal structures are prepared by CDO. Designs for
canals and minor structures are prepared by the designs office under the SE
responsible for implementation of the project. The progress of project
preparation work would be reviewed every six months by the AC to ensure the
implementation of established criteria for planning and preparation.
6.12      Submission of Project to CWC.  After approval by CE (IP), the
MIPs would be included in GOG's annual development plan to be reviewed
by the Planning Commission of GOI. Subsequent to GOI approval of the plan,
the selected MIPs would be submitted for CWC for appraisal.
6.13      Project Appraisal.  The AC would visit the sub-project area to
review the proposed sub-project in detail and ascertain that the proposed
MIP meets the criteria agreed with IDA (paras. 5.03-5.09). The AC would also
ensure that: the designs are technically sound, with special emphasis given
to the safety of the dam and to the drainage network; the proposed cropping
pattern is suitable for the command area; agricultural supporting services
are adequate; and the implementation schedule is realistic. The AC would
confirm and adjust the cost estimates as necessary and prepare a Project
Summary, which would be submitted to IDA. Field appraisal for projects with
a command area larger than 12,000 ha would be carried out with full partici-
pation of IDA, but responsibility for preparation of Project Summaries would
remain with AC. The first appraisal of a modernization project would also
be carried out with IDA participation.
6.14      Project Approval.  The AC would be authorized to approve sub-projects
that meet the technical criteria and cost less than Rs 70 M (US$8.1 M) exclud-
ing price contingencies if the benefit/cost ratio is higher than 1.0. In all
other cases, sub-projects would be reviewed by IDA which would base its deci-
sion on an analysis of Project Reports and Summaries (paras. 6.10 and 6.13),
supplemented by field visits, if necessary. It is expected that about 40% of
eligible MIPs representing more than 60% of the IDA financed investment pro-
gram, would be subject to detailed IDA review and approval.



- 34 -
6.15      Project Implementation.  The IP-Branch of PWD would be responsible
for the implementation of all irrigation works. Each MIP would be implemented
by two or three sub-divisions that would be technically and administratively
controlled by the divisional EE (para. 6.03). Agreements have been reached
with GOG that: (i) the DA would establish irrigated demonstration plots in
each MIP area; (ii) the DA would prepare a layout for each 8 ha block served
by an irrigation outlet, showing the design of water courses, field channels
and land shaping, and it would assist the farmers in implementing these works;
(iii) the DA would maintain staffing of its agricultural extension services
in the MIP areas in accordance with statewide standards to be agreed with IDA
(para 3.30); and (iv) in order to meet the needs of irrigated agriculture,
GOG would, where required, strengthen the credit, input supply, storage and
marketing facilities that serve the MIP areas. The PPM would continuously
monitor the progress of project implementation to ensure that all necessary
actions are taken by concerned departments. Progress of project implementa-
tion would be reviewed by AC three times during each construction season.
During one of these review missions, special emphasis would be given to the
construction of the dams.
6.16      Operation and Maintenance.  As at present, responsibility for day-
to-day operation of each project would rest with the sub-divisional Deputy
Engineer. Under him, three to five Section Officers would each be responsible
for a section of the canal system (commanding about 5,000 ha) down to the farm
turnouts. Within this area, about four Canal Inspectors would assess the
water delivery requirements and each would supervise two gate keepers, who
would operate sluices and outlets and do routine maintenance within a command
area of about 500 ha each. Water would be delivered, on a rotational basis,
through outlets serving about 8 ha. Before the beginning of each irrigation
season, the farmers would submit applications for irrigation water through the
Canal Inspector to the divisional EE. Water allocation would subsequently
be determined by the Canal Advisory Committee, which includes staff from PWD
and Department of Agriculture and farmers' representatives. Under the credit,
this committee would be strengthened so that it could coordinate all other
activities pertaining to irrigated agriculture such as cropping patterns,
input distribution and credit facilities.
6.17      Most system maintenance would take place during the non-irrigation
season (March to May) with the use of temporarily hired labor or small unit
price contractors. The gate keepers are responsible for routine maintenance
during the irrigation season. An agreement was reached with GOG that it
would provide adequate funds for O&M of the MIPs financed under the credit.
Since the present investigation and design practices for storage and diver-
sion dams are consistent with IDA standards, no criteria has been specified
for these structures. However, the designs of the dams would be reviewed by
technical experts from CWC--representing the fields of hydrology, geology
and structural engineering--to ensure its safety. An agreement has also been
reached with GOG that periodic safety inspections, under arrangements satis-
factory to IDA, would be undertaken for all dams. The proposed arrangements
would be submitted for IDA review not later than December 31, 1978.

Progress Review and Reporting Requirements
6.18      Progress review and reporting requirements, which have been agreed
with CWC, are designed to: (i) ensure that the projects are designed,
appraised and implemented in accordance with the agreed criteria; (ii) ensure
that work for which disbursements are requested actually has been carried out;
(iii) provide information to allow better project preparation and appraisal
in the future; (iv) provide guidance for the AC staff in its review of project
progress; (v) develop channels for mutual exchange of experience between IDA,
CWC and GOG staff; and (vi) provide early warning signals to IDA if problems
are developing in implementation of the MIPs.
6.19      The following reports would be prepared by the AC:
(a) An "Annual Implementation Program" would be prepared after
a review, with the GOG officials of projects under pre-
paration and implementation. Special attention would be
given to budgetary allocation for each sub-project in order
to ensure that adequate funds would be provided in accord-
ance with agreed implementation schedules.
(b)  A "Progress Summary:  Preparation" would be prepared after
each visit to the Divisional Office where a sub-project is
being prepared and preferably to the project site. Progress
of sub-project preparation would be reviewed every six months.
(c) A "Progress Summary: Implementation" would be prepared and
updated three times during each construction season, after
visits to the MIP site.
(d)  A "Progress Summary:  Operation" would be prepared once a
year after a visit to the completed project to assess
irrigation benefits and to review the quality and effec-
tiveness of O&M.
6.20      The main thrust of IDA review would be to:  (i) assess the quality
of AC's appraisal and review work; (ii) spot check whether agreed criteria
have been followed; (iii) review procurement procedures; (iv) check the
financial records kept by GOI and GOG; (v) assess the appropriateness of
established criteria; and (vi) examine the contents and timing of reports
submitted by CWC.
Cost Recovery
6.21      Capital and O&M Costs.  The investment cost for MIPs would amount
to about Rs 15,000 per ha and the annual charge for recovery of these costs
over 50 years at 10% would be about Rs 1,510 per ha. Annual O&M costs are
estimated at Rs 70 per ha.
1/   The format and content of these reports are given in the Implementation
Report.



- 36 -
6.22      Water and Water Related Charges.  At present, the prime vehicle
for recovery of capital and O&M costs for irrigation works is the water charge.
GOG has a policy of reviewing and revising the water charge every two or three
years. Over the last decade, the rates have increased about 2% annually in
real terms, reflecting the increased agricultural productivity. The next
review is due in 1978. The present rates, together with the rates in
Maharashtra, are the highest in the country:
Crop                              Rate (Rs/ha)
Paddy                                       104
Other kharif foodgrains                      27
Wheat                                       104
Other rabi foodgrains                        74
Groundnuts (kharif)                          74
Cotton                                      124
Sugarcane (12 months)                       585
6.23      For the projected cropping pattern of the MIPs, the water rate
would average about Rs 104 per ha of CCA. A 20% local cess is levied on the
water rate, which would bring the total assessment up to about Rs 125 per ha.
6.24      The Irrigation Act 1/ provides for collection of a betterment levy
from farmers benefitting from irrigation works. According to the Act, the
betterment levy should be set at half the increase in land value due to an in-
dividual project (defined on a before-and-after basis). The repayment period
and the interest to be charged on the outstanding amount are set through an
executive order, published in the Official Gazette. However, the assessment
of the betterment levy has been successfully challenged in the courts, and,
like in most other States, the levy is, not collected at present.
6.25      Other Agricultural Taxes.  GOG is making a strong tax effort. 2/  In
recent years, its tax revenue has increased about 10% per year in real terms,
and is presently about Rs 130 per capita or roughly 50% above the national
average.  Since incomes in the agricultural sector are much lower than in the
manufacturing and service sectors, the rate of agricultural taxation is rela-
tively modest. The land revenue and associated cesses amount to about Rs 15-
20 per ha. More important from a revenue point of view is the agricultural
sales tax which is levied--at a rate of 4%--on cotton and oilseeds. It is
estimated that GOG's revenues from the agricultural sales tax would increase
by Rs 120 per hectares brought under irrigation from an MIP. In addition,
GOG would get significant additional revenues from taxes levied on agricul-
tural processing industries.
6.26      Level of Cost Recovery.  Considering all the water and water related
charges collected at present, the annual payments would amount to about
1/   The Bombay Irrigation Act of 1897, as subsequently modified.
2/   For a review of GOG's finances see:  "Gujarat State Finances and
Planning for Irrigation and Agriculture," by Roger Grawe, December 1977.



- 37 -
Rs 125/ha. This would give a cost recovery index of 8%. Taking into account
the automatic increase in revenues from agricultural sales taxes, due to the
construction of MIPs, GOG would recover about 16% of the annual capital and
O&M costs.
6.27      Farmers' Ability to Pay Water Charges.  For the assessment of farmers'
ability to pay water charges, the "project rent" has been estimated. The pro-
ject rent is equal to net incremental farm income less the necessary rewards
to the farm family for its labor, entrepreneurship and cultivation risk. The
project rent has been analyzed for two representative farm models: a 2.0 ha
farm on the Gujarat mainland and a 5.0 ha farm in Saurashtra (Annex 1, T18).
At the present level of yields and prices, the prevailing water charges re-
present about 9% of the average project rent. At full development in the late
1980's, the project rent for MIPs is estimated at about Rs 3,000 per ha, which
would give a rent recovery index of 4% if the water rates remain unchanged.
However, in the past, the water rates have been increased in real terms to
reflect the increased benefits from irrigation. This trend is likely to con-
tinue in the future. Even though more than two-thirds of the expected bene-
ficiaries presently have incomes below the poverty level, their incomes
would increase five or six-fold as a result of the construction of a new MIP
(paras. 7.04-7.05). Thus, there would appear to be scope for a significant
increase in the water related charges.
6.28      However, there are not only large variations in the benefits accru-
ing from different projects but also between different farmers in the same
project. In view of the difficulties of assessing the benefits to each indi-
vidual farmer, the general policy in India is to charge a uniform water rate.
It has been observed in the older projects, that the water supply to most tail-
end farmers is highly unreliable and their benefits from "irrigation" are
fairly low. Consequently, water rates have to be set at a low level in order
to give the tail-end farmers sufficient incentive to use irrigation water,
even though the "average" farmer would be able to pay substantially higher
charges. Until it is technically and administratively possible to implement
volumetric water charges that better reflect the benefits that accrue to each
farmer, the water charges will generally remain at an inherently low level.
6.29      The technical standards introduced under the credit are specific-
ally designed to ensure that each farmer in the command area receives a
reliable water supply. The cost per hectare of command area 1/ would be sig-
nificantly higher than in existing MIPs while, at the same time the benefits
to the individual farmer would be higher and more secure. There is a clear
justification for collecting higher charges from the farmers benefitting from
the construction of new MIPs and from the modernization of existing MIPs.
Consequently, agreements have been reached with GOG that it would: (i) by
December 31, 1982, review the water and water-related charges in the State;
and (ii) based on the outcome of the review and after paying due regard to
IDA's comments, implement a system of such charges to ensure recovery of
1/   However, the cost per actually irrigated hectare would be lower than
in existing systems.

annual O&M costs and, to the extent possible, cost of infrastructure invest-
ments. In establishing the level of charges, due consideration would be
given to incentives for and payment capacity of farmers.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION _/
General
7.01      The proposed credit would assist in expanding the area under irri-
gation and increase the productivity of existing irrigation projects. Through
these means, it would increase the production of foodgrains, oilseeds and long
staple cotton and provide additional year-round employment opportunities to
landless laborers and small farmers. The provision of irrigation in low
rainfall areas would reduce the risk of drought and famine.
7.02      Organizational arrangements introduced under the credit would
strengthen local capabilities for project planning, design and implementation
and, thus, lead to a general improvement in the technical and economic via-
bility of all projects in the irrigation sector.
7.03      The overall impact of IDA supported works can be summarized as
follows:

Income Effects
7.04      At present, some 70% of Gujarat's farmers have no access to irri-
gation. Another 25% of the farmers have, on the average, one-quarter of their
land irrigated, usually from privately owned wells. The lack of irrigation
facilities is the major constraint facing these farmers. Once this con-
straint is removed, net farm incomes increase five or six-fold. The estimated
income effects of the MIP component are:
1/   The assumptions regarding prices, yields, input requirements and the
derived crop and farm budgets and economic benefits are given in
Annex 1, T13-T19. Details of the economic analysis are presented in
the Implementation Report.

7.05      Somewhat over three-quarters (in area terms) of the MIPs in Gujarat's
project pipeline would be constructed in mainland Gujarat and one-quarter or
less in Saurashtra and Kutch. In terms of farm families benefitting from
the construction of MIPs, about seven-eights would live on the mainland.
The present and future income levels of the MIP beneficiaries are illustrated
below:

Income for India (US$300)               99%         99%     66%
7.06      Most of the benefits of the modernization of MIPs would go to
farmers in the tail-end of existing systems. At present, these farmers
rarely receive any water and their incomes would basically follow the same
pattern as the incomes of farmers benefitting from the construction of new
MIPs. Farmers in the head-reaches would benefit from reduced water logging
and a more reliable water supply. Their income gains would be relatively
modest.
Economic Rates of Return (ERR)
7.07      According to the economic criteria established for new MIPs, CWC
would be authorized to approve projects with an ERR exceeding 12%. Based
on an average investment cost of Rs 15,000 per ha and on typical cropping
patterns for Saurashtra and mainland Gujarat, it is estimated that the
average ERR of MIPs would be around 19%. Based on an estimated investment
cost of Rs 4,000 per ha for modernization component the ERR is estimated at
26%. The overall ERR for the two components together is estimated at 20%.



- 40 -
Project Risks
7.08      The risk associated with the construction of new MIPs components
would stem from: (i) uncertain hydrology (ii) the use of standardized yield
and input projections for the economic evaluation of all sub-projects; and
(iii) the procedures for approval and progress review of sub-projects. The
hydrological data base is typically poor for the MIPs since the smaller rivers
are flashy and require continuous gauging during the monsoon, which has not
been the case in the past (paras 4.20 and 5.11). The criteria adopted for
MIPs (para 5.04) are designed to improve the data base and equipment would
be provided for this purpose. Thus, for MIPs financed under the credit, the
risk would be acceptable. The agro-economic conditions in all sub-project
areas would be reflected primarily in the cropping patterns. The irrigated
yields in different parts of the State are broadly similar and the estimated
ERR is not sensitive to the prevailing differences in rainfed yields. Con-
sequently, the error introduced by the use of standardized projections in
the evaluation of an individual sub-project would be small. Furthermore,
the overestimation of actual benefits for one MIP would be compensated for by
the underestimation of benefits for another. Thus, the risk of the MIPs taken
as a group is minimal. Arrangements for approval of the sub-projects and the
reporting requirements that would permit IDA to identify problems early and to
intervene directly, if necessary, are designed to minimize the risk associated
with the proposed appraisal and progress review procedures. Furthermore, the
project would also include a monitoring and evaluation component. In view of
the benefits from institution building, the risk is acceptable, and the risk
associated with the modernization works is small.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      An agreement has been reached with GOI and GOG that IDA-financed
MIPs would be designed, constructed and completed in accordance with estab-
lished technical and economic criteria (para 5.03).

(c) The accounts would be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA (para 5.22);



- 41 -
(d) Audit summaries would be submitted to IDA within
nine months of each fiscal year together with the
auditor's reports (para 5.22);
(e) Complete accounts and financial statements would be
made available for inspection during IDA review
missions (para 5.22);
(f) It would take all measures as considered necessary to
minimize the risk of malaria and other water related
diseases in areas covered by MIPs financed under the
credit (para 5.23);
(g) A Project Preparation Committee, headed by the District
Development Officer and comprising the EE responsible
for Project preparation (convener), the Agronomist--
Irrigated Agriculture and district level officers from
Agriculture, Cooperative, Revenue and Forestry Departments,
would be established for each MIP to be financed under
the credit (para 6.10);
(h) The DA would establish irrigated demonstration plots in
each MIP area (para 6.15);
(i) The DA would prepare a layout for each 8 ha block served
by an irrigation outlet, showing the design of water courses,
field channels and land shaping, and it would assist the
farmers in implementing these works (para 6.15);
(j) The DA would maintain staffing of its agricultural extension
services in each MIP area in conformity with statewide
standards to be agreed upon between IDA and GOG (para 6.15);
(k) In order to meet the increasing needs of irrigated farming,
GOG would, if necessary, strengthen the credit, input supply,
storage and marketing facilities that serve the farmers in
the MIP areas (para 6.15);
(1) GOG would provide adequate funds to operate and maintain
all project works in accordance with sound engineering
standards (para 6.17);
(m)  GOG would undertake periodic safety inspections in accord-
ance with arrangements satisfactory to IDA, of all MIP
dams, the proposed arrangements for the inspections would
be submitted for IDA review not later than December 31,
1978 (para 6.17); and
(n) GOG would, by December 31, 1982, review the water and water-
related charges in the State, and, based on the outcome of



- 42 -
the review and after paying due regard to IDA's comments,
implement a system of charges that would ensure recovery
of annual O&M costs and, to the extent possible, costs of
infrastructure investments. In establishing the level of
charges, due consideration would be given to incentives for
and payment capacity of farmers (para 6.29).
8.04      With the above agreements, the proposed project would be suitable
for a sector credit of US$85.0 M on standard IDA terms. The Borrower would
be the Government of India.

1/  Exponential trend, fitted through least square regression.
2/  1972/73 and 1974/75 were extreme drought years.  The low rainfall in these
years not only affected the yields but also the cropped area. Since these
two drought years occurred almost in sequence and towards the end of the
time period, they might seriously distort the regression results especially
for the 1963/64-1976/77 time period. Thus, in the "adjusted" time series,
1972/73 and 1974/75 have been excluded.
3/ t - values are given within parentheses.
* - indicates that the coefficient is significant at the 10% level for a

Salient Features of Sukhi Irrigation Project
The Sukhi Irrigation project is one of the MIPs anticipated to
be included under the line of credit. Preliminary work on the project
started in 1977/78. The project was reviewed in detail by the IDA appraisal
mission.
The project is located in the Baroda District in central Gujarat.
It envisages the construction of a dam across the Sukhi River in the
Narmada Basin, along with a distribution and drainage network. The project
would benefit about 6,600 farm households mostly of the subsistence cate-
gory which practice rainfed farming. Farm size distribution in the command
area is 50% less than 2 ha, 35% between 2 to 5 ha and about 15% above 5 ha.
Average per capita farm income is about Rs 450 and well below the poverty
level. About 30% of the population belongs to tribal groups and about 47%
of the agricultural labor force comes from landless households. Salient
features of this project are:

1/ Some studies of farmers' behavior, show that a simple approach can be
adopted to take into account the farmers' risk aversion by estimating a
certainty equivalent value (CE) of the expected value (EV). The formula
used is:                     CE = EV - n x s
where s = the standard deviation
n = a factor that expresses the farmers' risk aversion
The studies indicate that the farmers' choice of cropping patterns and
production techniques can be predicted for values of "n" in the interval
1 to 2 and that "n " decreases when the farm size increases. For this
analysis, it is assumed that n = 1.5 for the 2.0 ha farm in mainland
Gujarat and n - 1.2 for the 5 ha farm in Saurashtra. The variation in
historical gross returns under rainfed conditions are roughly within 20%
of the average values in mainland Gujarat and 30% in Saurashtra. It has
been assumed that under "with project" conditions, the gross returns
would bary within 10% of the average values.
2/ The reward for management and entrepreneurship is primarily a premium for
the special skills that farm management requires. Consequently, it has
been assumed that the "management fee" is equal to 10% of the net returns.

GUJARAT MEDIUM IRRIGATION SECTOR CREDIT
IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
I. Criteria for Medium Irrigation Projects
General
1.        Based on a review of existing medium irrigation projects (MIPs)
in Gujarat and of present design standards, a number of specific criteria
for the planning, design and construction of MIPs to be financed under the
medium irrigation sector credit have been developed. It would be the
responsibility of CWC to ensure that these criteria are met for all the
sub-projects approved.
Soil Survey
2.        A soil survey and land classification derived therefrom should
be carried out prior to the implementation of the MIP 1/ in order to estab-
lish the acreages and the levels of suitability of the proposed project lands
for sustained crop production under irrigation. The lands should be classi-
fied through consideration of the physical and chemical attributes, topo-
graphy, drainage and other relevant soil-related characteristics, and should
be designated by classes on the basis of the integrated effects of these
characteristics on attainable, profitable crop production. The land classi-
fication should identify: (i) classes of land suitable for production of
various types of crops; (ii) the need for land shaping and other soil con-
servation measures; and (iii) lands where irrigation development would not
be feasible. These classes should be indicated appropriately on maps along
with subscripts denoting the kind and the intensity of constraints that now
have or would have a strong influence on the yield and/or on the cost of
producing adaptable crops.
Agricultural Development Plan
3.        An agricultural development plan should be prepared for each MIP
area. The plan, which would take local agricultural, social and economic
constraints into account would: (i) establish and justify the design crop-
ping pattern; (ii) outline necessary actions to strengthen the agricultural
supporting services; and (iii) identify measures required to ensure good
on-farm water management. In order to provide a basis for the plan, an
agro-economic survey should be undertaken in the command area prior to the
1/   For on-going projects, these data can be collected concurrently with
project construction.



66
ANNEX 2
Page 2
planning of the project. 1/ The project preparation committee representing
the Department of Agriculture, PWD, local, and other interested parties
should be responsible for the plan and survey. The survey should cover the
following factors:
(a) Demographic and social characteristics (i.e. population,
average family size, labor force, etc.);
(b) Employment (farm, non-farm) and income;
(c) Land use, ownership and farm size distribution;
(d) Existing cropping pattern and yields (distinguish
between rainfed and irrigated agriculture;
(e) Agricultural production and marketable surplus;
(f) Use of agricultural inputs for both rainfed and irrigated
conditions (i.e., fertilizer, draft power, etc.);
(g) Marketing channels and prices; and
(h) Agricultural supporting services (i.e., extension services,
research, storage facilities, credit, transport, etc.).
Water Supply and Demand
4.        The following hydrological data would be required for each MIP:
(a) A stream gauging network should be established on major
tributaries and/or at the dam site to develop basic hydro-
logical data for the planning, design and operation of the
project. 1/ Initial emphasis should be on obtaining fre-
quent gauge heights readings and in establishing the stage-
discharge rating curve so that stream runoff can be recorded
on a daily, monthly and annual basis. The gauge-discharge
relationship should be verified by current meter measure-
ments; however, until such time as measurements by current
meter become available it may be necessary to rely on the
float method now commonly used. (See ISO publication
R 1,100, establishment and operation of a gauging station
and determination of the stage-discharge relation.)
(b) Stream flow should be reconstituted on a monthly basis for
a 20-year period using established rainfall-runoff correla-
tions and recorded runoff patterns at nearby stream gauging
1/   For on-going projects, the agro-economic survey and the current meter
measurements could be carried out simultaneously with the construction
of the dam or diversion weir.

or existing reservoir projects. At least one-year stream
gauging record for the MIP should be included in the 20-year
study period. MIPs submitted for approval in the second
and third years should have a 2 and 3-year stream gauging
record for correlation purposes, respectively.
(c) Sediment estimates should be developed at each dam site by
an actual sediment sampling program. In the absence of
actual measurements an estimate could be based on measured
sediment deposition at existing reservoirs in surrounding
areas. It would be desirable to establish sediment ranges
for new reservoirs constructed under this credit so that
measurements of silt can be made in the future.
5.        General planning criteria to be followed in determining water
requirements and for reservoir operation studies:
(a) Crop water requirements for paddy and diversified upland
crops should be calculated according to the modified Penman
method (FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 24). A monthly
or, preferably, a fortnightly irrigation water requirement
should be developed for the study period using actual monthly
recorded rainfall in the project command area (as measured
at a centrally located station or as an average of two or
more representative stations). Irrigation water would be
required during the paddy growing period to offset percola-
tion losses and to maintain the desired cultivation depth
(normally 25 to 75 mm).
(b) At this stage of development, assumed field irrigation
efficiencies should not exceed 90% for paddy and 70% for
diversified (upland) crops.
(c) For planning purposes, assumed conveyance efficiency should
not be more than 75%.
(d) Early seeding of kharif crops should be encouraged. Wherever
possible land preparation for cereals, groundnuts and cotton
should be done prior to the month of June, so that pre-monsoon
irrigations could be limited to seeding and one additional
irrigation in case monsoon rains were delayed. Pre-kharif
water should also be provided for paddy nursery needs. Land
preparation for transplanting of paddy would be delayed until
the first rains or inflow to the reservoir become available.
Project water supplies would normally not be sufficient enough
for irrigation of hot season crops. Perennials such as sugarcane,
bananas and fruit should not be supplied with project water unless
the fields served have established wells for meeting the irrigation
needs in the hot weather season.

ANNEX 2
Page 4
(e) A full kharif water supply should be the first objective
in the reservoir operation and carry-over storage should
normally be provided for pre-monsoon irrigation. A 10%
under - irrigation in any single month could be assumed
with a slight reduction in yield. The area to be cropped
in the rabi season would be determined by the storage
available at the end of the monsoon (rainy season) which
normally is the end of September. For the economic eva-
luation, the average rabi acreage served during the 20-year
operation study period should be used in the computation.
Design Criteria
6.        The following minimum design standards should be met:
(a) The Public Works Department should layout, design, con-
struct and maintain lined conveyance and distribution
facilities (i.e., main canals, branches, distributaries,
minors and sub-minors) down to regulated outlets serving
8 ha (as an average) command areas.
(b) Minors should be designed together with connecting sub-minors
to deliver 1 to 2 cusecs of water on a warabundi (rotational)
basis.
(c) Conveyance and delivery channels should be designed and con-
structed to permit full irrigation deliveries to command
areas from canals, distributaries and minors when they are
flowing at less than 50% capacity. Ordinarily, cross-
regulation would be obtained with gates or stop logs at
bridge crossings and inlet transitions to other canal
structures. However, when necessary, separate cross-
regulator structures should be provided. Continuous check-
ing to full design capacity should be avoided as it increases
canal seepage losses. Cross regulation would be required
immediately downstream of escape structures.
(d) Escapes (wasteways) should be provided at the end of canals
and as needed at various points along the canal alignment.
Wherever possible wasteway gates should be combined with
side channel overflow sections so as to provide both an
automatic control feature and capacity to empty the canal.
(e) Drain inlets and other design alternatives for cross drainage
structures should be considered whenever flood or erosion
protection would be beneficial to cultivated lands below the
main canal and where there would be an opportunity to store
the intercepted water in a "balancing" reservoir. A reduc-
tion in number and magnitude of cross-drainage flows would
reduce the structures needed in minors and sub-minors, would



69
ANNEX 2
Page 5
facilitate farming operations by the cultivators and
permit an increase in CCA by reclaiming land which would
otherwise be lost to drainage channels. Project managers
should record high water marks on existing structures so
that slope-area determinations of flood occurrences could
be used to check the validity of theoretical formulae and,
thus, provide data for improving designs in the future.
(f) Small regulating ("balancing") reservoirs within the CCA,
along the canal alignment or above the canal would increase
project water supplies for the irrigation scheme, add
flexibility to project operation and reduce main canal
capacity needed during peak periods. Where topographic
conditions are favorable for developing a significant
increment of storage, the addition of the reservoir should
be considered.
(g) An auxilliary spillway (overflow section) in combination
with a smaller service spillway (gated masonry section)
should be used wherever topographic and geological condi-
tions are favorable. A concrete sill or cap should be
provided for the overflow section to ensure that the crest
elevation would be maintained. Damage sustained downstream
from the overflow crest, if and when the spillway comes
into use, would be treated as an operation and maintenance
expenditure. In addition to the possibility for reducing
spillway costs the presence of an overflow section would
reduce the risk of dam failure due to a flood occurrence
greater than predicted in the design flood computation.
(h) Structures for measurement of water flows should be provided
from the head of the main canal down to and including each
minor.
Construction Methods
7.        The construction of the MIPs should follow sound engineering
practices, in particular:
(a) Special care should be taken in the construction of canals
and distributors to guard against leakage and erosion. In
this regard, canal embankments and earthfill around struc-
tures should be thoroughly compacted. Furthermore, where
the canal invert is in fill, the invert should be compated.
Mechanical compaction equipment should be employed whenever
feasible.
(b) To ensure proper settlement of foundation in minors and sub-
minors the sections should be thoroughly saturated by ponding
or exposing to one season of monsoon rains before lining
operations are undertaken.

ANNEX 2
Page 6
(c) Construction should be scheduled for completion within
five years or less.
(d) GOG should ensure that watercourses and field channels are
constructed and that land shaping is done by the concerned
individuals/agencies prior to delivery of irrigation water.
For this purpose, the GOG should prepare a layout for each
8 ha block served by an outlet, showing the design of
watercourses, field channels and landshaping. The GOG
should provide technical guidance to the farmers and where
required, construct the watercourses and field channels.
Cost Estimates
8.        Cost estimates for the project should be based on bid prices pre-
vailing in the region in which project is located, at the time of submission
of project to CWC. To account for variations in estimated quantities and
any change in scope and design of the project, at the time of actual con-
struction of a project, a physical contingency factor of 20% of the con-
struction cost should be considered in the project estimate. Establishment
charges at the rate of 15% of the construction cost (excluding cost of land
and equipment) should be provided in the estimates. The estimate should
also include cost of land acquisition and resettlement of farmers displaced
due to the project.
Economic Criteria
9.        The economic viability of the projects should be established
through a comparison of the discounted project benefits with the discounted
project costs. In order to ensure that consistent and realistic yield,
input and price assumptions are made to simplify the calculations, the bene-
fit matrix, 1/ developed by IDA, should be used for the economic evaluation
of projects included under the credit. The "Form for establishing the
economic viability of medium irrigation projects" should be filled out in
the following manner:
(a) Benefits. The present and the anticipated cropping pattern
should be inserted on the appropriate lines of the form and
total benefits should be calculated through multiplications
with the benefit factors of each crop. Adjustments should
be made to the benefit factors to reflect the conditions in
various agro-climatic zones. The "without project" cropping
pattern should include land that would be flooded by the
reservoir and taken out of production because of the con-
struction of canals.
1/   Basic assumptions used in the derivation of the economic value per ha
of each crop ("benefit factors") are described in detail in Chapter III.



71
ANNEX 2
Page 7
(b) Costs. The basic project cost should be calculated in accord-
ance with procedures described in para 8. For the economic
analysis, land acquisition cost should be excluded. The basic
cost should be adjusted for the length of the implementation
period. For projects with an implementation period of five
years, no adjustment should be done, for projects with a four
and three-year implementation period, the base cost would be
reduced by 6% and 11% respectively.
(c) Economic Viability. The build-up rates and discounting factors
for both benefits and costs are taken into account in the
benefit factors. Consequently, the total incremental project
benefit should be compared directly to the adjusted project
cost. If the benefit/cost (B/C) ratio is higher than 1.0, 1/
the AC would be authorized to approve the project.
II. Reporting Requirements
10.       The following reports would be prepared by CWC's Appraisal
Committee and submitted to IDA for review:
(a)  An "Annual Implementation Program" would be prepared
after a review, with the GOG officials of projects
under preparation and implementation. Special atten-
tion would be given to budgetary allocation for each
sub-project in order to ensure that adequate funds
would be provided in accordance with agreed imple-
mentation schedules.
(b)  A "Progress Summary:  Preparation" would be prepared
after each visit to the Divisional Office where a sub-
project in being prepared and preferably to the project
site. Progress of sub-project preparation would be
reviewed every six months.
(c)  A "Progress Summary:  Implementation" would be prepared
and updated three times during each construction season,
after visits to the MIP site.
(d) A "Progress Summary: Operation" would be prepared once
a year after a visit to the completed project to assess
irrigation benefits and to review the quality and effec-
tiveness of O&M.
The format of these reports are given in Appendix 2. 2!
1/   A 12% rate of opportunity of capital has been chosen for the
calculation of the benefit factors.
2/   The format is subject to change after return of an IDA mission that
presently is reviewing the progress of the Orissa Irrigation Project.

III. Development of Benefit Matrix for Medium Irrigation Projects
General
11.       The medium irrigation projects (MIPs) would be appraised and
approved by the AC of CWC within a free limit of Rs 70 M. In order to ensure
that assumption of yields, inputs and prices are uniform and realistic and
that projects financed by the IDA credit are economically viable, a benefit
matrix, developed by IDA would be applied to the economic evaluation of
projects submitted to the AC for approval.
12.       Based on field visits and analyses of available climatic and agro-
economic data, the following conclusions have been drawn:
(i) the variations in rainfall and soil types between
different parts of the State and reflected in both
yields and cropping patterns under rainfed conditions;
(ii)  under irrigated conditions, the yeilds differ relatively
little from one agro-climatic zone to another; however,
there are relatively large variations in the irrigated
cropping patterns of various zones; and
(iii)  for the purpose of evaluating MIPs, the State can broadly
be divided into five agro-climatic zones.
13.       Consequently, the benefit matrix has been designed to accommodate
local variations in cropping patterns, both under "with project" and "without
project" conditions. The "without project" cropping pattern would be derived
from a survey of the present cropping pattern in the MIP area. The "with
project" cropping pattern would be projected by the local agricultural staff
and reviewed by the Project Preparation Committee (see para 6.10). Recommended
ranges for the area under the major crops have been developed by IDA to guide
AC in its appraisal of individual MIPs. The ranges have been specified for
the five agro-climatic zones.
14.       The benefit factors for each irrigated and rainfed crop are based
on standardized yield and input assumptions that reflect the "average" situ-
ation in Gujarat. Differences in the yield levels between the agro-climatic
zones are taken into account through an adjustment of the total benefits
accruing from rainfed crops in the project area, both with and without the
MIP.
Basic Assumptions
15.       Yields and Crop Input Requirements.  The State-wide average irri-
gated and rainfed yields in a year with normal rainfall are shown in SAR,

ANNEX 2
Page 9
Annex 1, T-15. 1/ The same table also gives the projected future yields and
the input requirements and economic crop budgets.
16.       Prices.  Economic prices and conversion factors of agricultural
outputs, inputs and construction costs are discussed in Chapter IV.
17.       Discounting Factor.  A 12% interest has been chosen in the devel-
opment of benefit matrix as this rate approximately represents the opportunity
cost of capital in India. The final year of the construction period is chosen
as the base year for discounting purpose.
18.       Build-up Rates.  In order to take into account the time perspective
of yield development, build-up rates have been estimated for each crop under
each situation (rainfed, irrigated). Full development of project benefits
is projected to be reached six to seven years after completion of the MIP.
Rainfed yields and yields of irrigated crops in the "without project" situ-
ation have similarly been assumed to grow--at a constant annual rate--for
about six or seven years after.
19.       Construction Costs.  The annual rate of implementation of MIPs
has been assumed as follows:
Year                         Implementing Period
5 Years              4 Years                   3 Years

-1           25                    21                        -

1/   The monsoon rainfall has a large influence on both rainfed and irri-
gated yields. Because of the variability of the rainfall, the present
yields for the major crops have been estimated by fitting an exponential
trend line to the State-wide yields over the last decade. (However,
the extreme drought years of 1972/73 and 1974/75 severely distorts
the trend and they have, thus, been excluded from the regression
analysis.)

Benefit Factors
20.       The crop specific benefit factors, expressed in rupees per hectare,
are based on the discounted net present value (NPV) of the future production
benefits from one hectare under the crop. Certain adjustments have been made
to the discounted NPV in order to simplify the application of the benefit
matrix for project evaluation. These adjustments are discussed below.
21.       A project is economically viable if the discounted benefits are
higher than the discounted costs:
0 b c                    50    bc                     p
Z  (A x               )     E   (B x  E      i        >      E      i *C*CCF

In addition to variables defined in para 19, the following variables are
used in formula (2):

B  = area under crop c without project

x  = (E            ) /(k  * CCF)                                     (4)
22.       The X , as defined in formula (4) above, is equal to the discounted
value of all future production benefits from one hectare under crop c, adjusted
to take the shadow pricing of construction cost and construction period into
account.  However, as noted in para 9, the value of k  depends on the imple-
mentation period. Most MIPs would be implemented over a five-year period,
which gives k  = 1.243.
The benefit factor for crop C is defined as:
50    bc
Fc=   (E          ) /(1.243 * 0.75)                      (5)

The factor K' represents an adjustment for implementation periods shorter
than five years. For four and three year implementation periods, K' is 0.94
and 0.89, respectively.
23.       The benefit/cost (B/C) ratio for an IMP is:
E  A  *F        E  B   *  F
B/C - ratio   c         c      C   c       c
K' * C
24.       A summary of benefit factors for future with and without project
conditions is presented in SAR, Annex 1, T-19. The discounted value of future
agricultural production would be established by multiplying the "future with
project" and present (approximation for the "future without project") cropping
patterns with the relevant benefit factors. The difference between "with"
and "without" production values would give the discounted net benefit of the
project, which would be divided by the adjusted capital cost to obtain the
benefit/cost ratio. A B/C-ratio above 1.0 indicates that the MIP is econo-
mically viable.
Adjustments to Benefit Factors
25.       There are significant variations in yields between the different
agro-climatic zones. Ideally, benefit factors should be developed for each
crop in each zone. However, the available agro-economic data is not reliable
enough to allow accurate estimates of the crop specific economic net returns
for each zone. Instead, a general adjustment factor, applied to the total
benefits derived from rainfed crops, has been estimated for each zone.
Variations in irrigated yields are relatively minor, and, consequently, they
have been disregarded.
26.       The following five agro-climatic zones have been defined for the
evaluation of MIPs. I/ The zones are:
Zone                             Districts
I                  Banaskantha, Kutch
II                  Amreli, Bhavagar, Janinagar
III                  Broach, Bulsar, Dangs, Surat
IV                  Baroda, Kaira, Panchmahals
V                  Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Mahesana, Sabarkantha
1/   Normally, GOG works with eight agro-climatic zones, that represents
variations in both yields and cropping patterns. Since the local
cropping patterns are explicitly taken into account in the benefit
matrix, the main purpose of the definition of agro-climatic zones
for the evaluation of MIPs is to take local yield variations into
account. For this purpose, five zones give the require accuracy.



77
ANNEX 2
Page 13
A brief description of the zones and the recommended ranges in cropping
patterns for MIPs in each zone are given in Appendix 1.
27.       Based on an analysis of present rainfed yields, the following yield
indices have been developed for the major crops:
Crop                     Zone I   Zone II   Zone III   Zone IV   Zone V

28.       Assuming an input elasticity in the order of 0.5 as a result of
yield increase, economic crop budgets have been developed for each zone.
Subsequently, the average actual return per ha for the zone has been esti-
mated, utilizing the prevailing rainfed cropping pattern. The corresponding
net returns based on the standard yield and input projections have been cal-
culated. By dividing the actual net return per ha by the weighted "standard"
net return per ha, an adjustment factor was estimated for each zone. This
adjustment factor corrects the error that is introduced when the standard
benefit factors are used for all zones. The estimated adjustment factors
are:
Zone                      I       II     III      IV     V
Adjustment Factor              67%     90%    100%   110%   100%

were also tested through a regression analysis based on district-wide and time

series data on kharif rainfall and irrigated yields. 1/ The results of these
regressions, which are shown in Figure 1, are generally in line with the yield
assumptions in para 27. However, there is a significant difference for ground-
nuts. This can largely be explained by the fact that the regression analysis
disregards the distribution of rainfall and the soil types.
IV. Prices for Economic Analyses
General
30.       The economic prices of major traded agricultural outputs and inputs
are derived from the IBRD projected 1985 world market prices expressed in 1978
currency value with appropriate adjustments for freight, handling and process-
ing. The projected economic prices for non-traded foodgrains, on the other
hand, are based on the historical ratios between these crops and that of wheat.
The financial prices of various crops are projected on the basis of their
historical price trends (para 33). Present and projected financial and eco-
nomic prices are given in SAR, Annex 1, T-13. The detailed assumptions behind
the estimates are described below.
Official Exchange Rate (OER)
31.       Until September 24, 1975, the Rupee was official valued at a fixed
Pound Sterling rate. Since then it has been fixed against a "basket" of cur-
rencies.   As these currencies are floating, the US Dollar/Rupee exchange
rate is subject to change. Conversions of financial prices have been made
at US$1 to Rs 8.60.
Standard Conversion Factor (SCF)
32.       The benefits of the MIPs are evaluated at world market prices, i.e.
they measure what India would have to pay for imports or receive for exports.
Most of the costs, however, are for items that are not traded on the world
1/   Regression equation:   Y  = a  + a. R  + Rk

R   = Kharif rainfall

Other variables such as fertilizer consumption, cultivable area per agri-
cultural worker and average farm sizes were included in the analysis but
the regression coefficients were always insignificant at the 10% level
and virtually no improvements in the correlation coefficient was achieved.

market. Tariffs and trade restrictions introduce a distortion in the price
relationship between traded goods -- valued at world market prices -- and
non-traded goods -- valued at local prices. Thus, the costs are not directly
comparable with the benefits. In order to make them comparable, an SCF is
applied to the price of non-traded goods and consumption. In the absence
of trade restrictions, the SCF can be approximately calculated using the
formula:
X + M
SCF     X+SMT              1
91 X + S + M + T      1/
x       m    -
For the period since 1970, this calculation gives an SCF of 0.86. However,
since this estimate does not take into consideration quantitative restric-
tions, it provides only an upper limit for the SCF. The Indian Planning
Commission recommends for the evaluation of industrial projects the use of
conversion factors for foreign exchange and for untraded goods that implicit-
ly give a SCF of about 0.75. Because of the approximate nature of this esti-
mate, a SCF of 0.8 has been used in the economic analysis.
Prices of Agricultural Outputs
33.       The economic prices for traded goods such as rice, wheat, maize,
sorghum, cotton, groundnuts and sugarcane are based on their border prices
at the OER. The domestic cost components (i.e. local transport and market-
ing charges) are adjusted by the SCF of 0.80. The economic prices for non-
traded foodgrains such as pulses are derived by applying the historical price
ratios between these outputs and wheat to the economic price of wheat.
Similarly, the economic price of non-traded oil crops has been derived
from the economic price of groundnuts. The projected financial prices
for various crops are based on the estimated historical price trends 2/
in India, adjusted for local conditions in Gujarat. In general, there is
a close correspondence between the projected economic and financial prices.
Prices of Agricultural Inputs
34.       Fertilizers have been valued at the projected world marker price.
Pesticides and insecticides have been assumed to be traded. It has further
been assumed that no taxes, duties or subsidies are levied on them and, thus,
the economic price is approximately equal to the financial price. The
financial price of bullocks and miscellaneous charges have been multiplied
1/   X = fob value of exports at the official exchange rate (OER); M = cif
value of imports at OER; S = export subsidies; T = import duties.

by the SCF to express them in economic terms. Analyses of farm labor supply
and demand in various Indian irrigation projects typically give an economic
shadow wage rate for farm labor in the range of 1/2 to 2/3 of the average
financial wage rate. For the analysis of MIPs in Gujarat a shadow wage rate
of 67% of the market wage has been assumed.
Construction Conversion Factor (CCF)
35.       The MIPs would be constructed using a mixture of equipment, skilled
and unskilled labor. For the economic analysis, the CCF is estimated as
follows:
(a) Traded Component. This component includes capital-intensive
works which require imported materials. Since it is traded,
the conversion factor is 1.00. It is estimated that about
15% of the construction costs fall under this category.
(b) Non-Traded Component. This component includes works that
require skilled labor and locally manufactured materials.
The SCF of 0.80 is used as the conversion factor for these
works. About 30% of the construction costs are included in
these category.
(c) Unskilled Labor. A minimum wage for unskilled construction
labor is in force in Gujarat. Since daily workers virtually
never are paid above the minimum wage, it is likely that this
wage is higher than the wage at which the workers would be
willing to work (i.e. their supply price). Civil works con-
struction is harder physical work than farming, and experience
from similar areas in India indicate that the laborers require
a premium of 25%-30% to shift from agriculture to construc-
tion work. By comparisons with agricultural wages in the
State, it is estimated that the construction laborers' supply
price is about 15% to 20% below the minimum wage. This gives
a shadow wage factor which is 10%-20% below the SCF, or appro-
ximately equal to 0.67. It is estimated that unskilled labor
constitutes about 55% of the construction cost.

V. Evaluation of Design Standards for Medium Irrigation Projects
General
37.       In order to fully utilize Gujarat's scarce surface water resources,
two major design improvements would be introduced for medium irrigation pro-
jects (MIPs) under the credit:
(a) The canal system would be extended down to regulated outlets
serving 8 ha blocks, on the average, instead of the tradi-
tional 40 ha blocks; and
(b) All canals would be fully lined.
This Chapter provides the economic justification for these design standards.
Estimates of Water Losses in Existing and Improved MIPs
38.        Conveyance Losses.  For a 10,000 ha unlined system with 40 ha
outlets, the wetted perimeter is typically 400,000 m (40 m /ha of CCA). For
a2corresponding lined system, the wetted perimeter is estim5ted at 350,000
m . The seepage losses are assumed to be 8 cusecs per M ft  in an unlined
system (silty clay loam, see para ....) and 2 cusecs per M ft  in a lined 3
system. The annual field irrigation requirements are estimated at 6,000 m /ha
of CCA for projects with a cropping intensity of about 120% and a mix of up-
land crops.
39.    3  The seepage Aosses when the canal system is running full are
0.975 m ls and 0.213 m /s for unlined and lined systems, respectively. When
the releases are less than what corresponds to the full capacity of the canal
system, the wetted perimeter is reduced. However, the reduction in wetted
perimeter is less than proportionate to the flow. If the canal deliveries
are rotated, the seepage losses are lower than if no rotation takes place.
It is estimated that the average seepage losses are 75% of the losses when
the system is running full. For a ten-month irrigation season, the total
seepage losses would be about 19.2 M m3 and 4.2 M m  for unlined and lined
systems, respectively.
40.       Operational losses occur both on farmers' fields and the canal
system. Some of the losses on the fields are due to poor farm irrigation
practices. However, wastages also occur when the releases from the canal
system are not properly controlled, which results in water deliveries either
at times when the farmer does not require water or in amounts that are larger
than what he requires to effectively irrigate his crops. These types of



82
ANNEX 2
Page 18
wastages are attributable to the canal system 1/ and are included in the ope-
rational losses in the canals, which also include wastages at the time of canal
closings, breaches, etc. In general, the operational losses are higher in an
unlined system than in a lined system. Based on a review of irrigation releases
and field irrigation requirements in a number of MIPs, it is estimated that
the operational losses in unlined systems is about 20% of the diversion. The
operational losses in lined systems are assumed to be 15%.
41.        The total conveyance losses in lined and unlined (10,000 ha) sys-
tems with outlets serving 40 ha blocks are thus estimated as follows:
Unlined  3  Lined
------M m -------
Total Releases                   99.0         99.0
Seepage Losses                 -19.2          -4.2
Operational Losses             -19.8         -14.9
Supplied at the Outlet          60.0          79.9
Conveyance Losses                39.4%        19.3%
Rounded                         40%           20%
42.       The conveyance losses in lined canal system with outlets serving
8 ha blocks (rather than 40 ha blocks) are estimated at 25% 2/. The con-
veyance efficiencies corresponding to these losses are:
Unlined system with 40 ha blocks             60%
Lined system with 40 ha blocks               80%
Lined system with 8 ha blocks                75%
43.        Field Irrigation Efficiencies.  For a 40 ha block, the field ditch
(channel) efficiency is estimated at 70% and the field application efficiency
at 75%, giving a field efficiency of 52.5%. In a 40 ha block, the total
length of field channels is typically about 70 m/ha. In an 8 ha block, the
length of field channels is reduced by about two-thirds. Thus, it is assumed
that the field ditch efficiency within an 8 ha block is about 90% which gives
an overall field efficiency of 67.5%.
1/   Many other studies count this as operational farm losses.  As a result
of this difference in definition, on-farm losses that have been observed
in most studies are higher than what is assumed in this study. However,
the overall system losses are of the same magnitude.
2/   Thus, there is an apparent increase in conveyance losses when the
lined canal system is extended down to outlets serving 8 ha from
20% to 25%. However, this increase is more than offset by the
reduction of field ditch losses between the outlet and the field
(see para 43). Thus, the overall losses from the reservoir down
to the field are estimated to be reduced from 58% to 33%. This
would enable a 60% increase in the irrigated area.

the corresponding project efficiencies can be summarized as follows:

Factors Determining the Value of Water Savings
45.        The economic value of water savings depend on a number of factors,
the most important of which are:
(a)  the water supply situation;
(b)  the groundwater situation; and
(c)  the level of agricultural development and the efficiency
with which farmers use irrigation water.
46.       The Water Supply Situation.  If the supply of water is plentiful
and the water allocation to the project under investigation can be increased
without any reduction in the supply to other projects, then the value of water
saved through design improvements is zero (i.e. the opportunity cost of water
is zero). In this case, modernization has to be justified through cost sav-
ings, reduced water logging and improved reliability of the irrigation supply.
This might be the case in delta areas of large, perennial rivers or in a few
river basins when the amount of cultivable land is limited. However, if the
water supply is scarce, any water savings will result in increased agricul-
tural production. This is virtually without exception the case in Gujarat
and in all the low rainfall areas of India. Consequently, the present analy-
sis is based on the assumption that the amount of water available is less
than what can be productively used for irrigation in the command area.
47.       The Groundwater Situation.  It is possible to identify four possible
groundwater situations, each of which require a separate type of economic
analysis:
(a)  Surplus groundwater--deep aquifer.  Under these circumstances,
it would be feasible for the Government to install tubewells
either for direct irrigation or for augmentation of canal
supplies. Thus, the Government can provide additional water
for irrigation either by pumping groundwater or by reducing
losses in the canal system. Under these circumstances, canal
lining is justified only if the cost of serving water through
lining is lower than the cost of pumping.



84
ANNEX 2
Page 20
(b) Surplus groundwater--shallow aquifer. In this case public
groundwater development would not be feasible. Since there
is surplus groundwater, additional recharge of the aquifer
is of no value. Water savings through better design of the
irrigation system will directly increase agricultural pro-
duction and if the production benefits are greater than the
cost of the improvements, then the improvements are justified.
(c) Limited groundwater resources. If the groundwater in the
project area already is fully utilized or can be expected to
be utilized in the near future, any reduction in the recharge
to the aquifer will reduce the water available for pumping.
In this case, lining, for example, results in making more
water available at the canal turnouts while at the same time
reducing -- albeit to a lesser extent -- groundwater irrigation.
Thus, an economic evaluation of design improvements has to take
the reduced groundwater recharge into account. This is the
prevailing situation in Gujarat.
(d) Non-useable groundwater.. If the aquifer is saline or cannot
be used for irrigation, any water going into the ground is
lost from productive use. The economic justification of design
improvements will follow the same principle as in (b).
48.       The Central Groundwater Board of GOI has estimated that between
one-third and half of the water lost through canal seepage gets absorbed in
the top layers of the soils in areas close to the canal where it is lost
through evaporation or non-productive evapotranspiration.  Of the remaining
quantity that reaches the groundwater table, only about 70% can be drawn
out locally. The rest regenerates elsewhere where it may or may not be
useable. 1/ Thus, between 35% and 67% of the seepage losses can be reused.
For the purpose of this analysis, it is assumed that 50% of the seepage
losses can be utilized through pumping of groundwater while the remaining
50% are inevitably lost.
49.       The cost of punping groundwa er, which depends on the aquifer,
ranges between Rs 9.12/m to Rs 0.23/mi for shallow wells (Table 1) and
is about Rs 0.09/m for augmentation tubewells.
50.       Value of Irrigation Water.  The weighted 2/ economic returns per
hectare for irrigated and rainfed crops are Rs 2,780 and Rs 670, respectively.
It is estimated that one hectare of irrigated crops replaces about two-thirds
of a hectare of rainfed crops. Thus, the net benefits from one hectare under
irrigation is about Rs 2,330.

Irrigation Systems and Integrated Development of Command Areas; New Delhi,
1973.
2/   The weights are based on the irrigated and rainfed cropping patterns
in 1970 according to the agricultural census.



85
ANNEX 2
Page 21
51.       Based on projected future yields, input requirements and prices,
the average returns from rainfed land are estimated at Rs 850 per ha. For
irrigation projects designed at present standards, the expected future returns
are estimated at Rs 4,210 per ha and for projects designed at the proposed
standards with irrigation outlets serving 8 ha blocks, the estimated returns
are Rs 4,730 per ha. The projected future net benefits from irrigation are
estimated at Rs 3,640 per ha for projects designed at present standards and
Rs 4,160 per ha for projects designed at improved standards.
52.     3 The gross utilization of irrigation water in 1973/74 was about
6,360 Mm from groundwater and 8,850 Mm from surface water. The losses
from the well to the plant can be assumed aS 25%. Canal systems have not
been completed for full use of the 8,850 Mm of surface flows that so far
have been harnessed by dams and diversion weirs. It is estimated that about
1/3 of the diversions can not be utilized at present. In para 44 above,
the overall efficiency for a typical MIP has been estimated at 32%. Records
of diversions and actual irrigation in several major projects indicate even
lower overall efficiencies for these projects. For all irrigation projects
in Gujarat, the overall efficiency can conservatively be set at 30%. Based
on these assumptions, the toSal amount of water available "it the plants"
can be estimated at 4,770 Mm  from groundwate3  and 1,770 Mm  from surface
sources, respectively, or a total of 6,540 Mm
53.       According to land use statistics, the irrigated area in 1973/74
was about 1.5 M Va, which would give an average water application at the
plant of 4,360 m per ha actually irrigated. However, it is likely that
the agricultural census provides more reliable data than the land use stat-
istics. Based on a comparison of the data for 1970/71, it is estimated that
the land use statistics are over-estimated by about 30%, which would give
an actually irrigated area of 1.15 M ha in 1973/74.  In t is case, the aver-
age water application at the plant would be about 5,690 m per ha actually
irrigated.
54.       By conservatively assuming that the water application is 5,690 m
per ha, the value of water is estimated at:
Value of Water (Rs/m )
Present, surface prbjects                         0.36
Present, groundwater                              0.41
Future, surface projects designed
at present standards                            0.64
Future, surface projects designed
at improved standards and
groundwater                                     0.73



86
ANNEX 2
Page 22
55.       For the present analysis, 2he average value between present and
future have been chosen as R fl0.50/m for surface projects designed at pre-
sent standards and Rs 0.57/m for groundwater and surface projects designed
at improved standards. The higher value for the latter is due to a more
reliable water supply.
Evaluation of Design Improvements for MIPs
56.       The investment cost for the distribution network in an unlined
canal system with 40 ha outlets is estimated at Rs 1,600 per ha of CCA. For
a lined system the cost is estimated at Rs 3,080 per ha with 40 ha outlets
and Rs 3,800 per ha with 8 ha outlets, net of engineering overheads (15%) and
physical contingencies (20%). For the economic analysis, these financial
costs are multiplied by the construction conversion factor (0.75).

62.       Besides the benefits that have been included in the analysis above,
canal lining would:
(a) Reduce water logging near the canals;
(b) Reduce weed growth and the resulting deterioration of canal
capacity;



89
ANNEX 2
Page 25
(c) Reduce O&M costs;
(d) Improve the reliability of water deliveries through reduction
of breaches etc; and
(e) Reduce the costs for earthwork and structures.
63.       Because of these additional benefits that would result from canal
lining, the "cut-off" seepage rates given in para 60 are conservatively high.
Especially for minor canals (say, with a capacity below 100 cusecs) experience
in India has shown that the benefits from items (b) through (d) above are si-
nificant. Since the cost of lining minor canals typically is around Rs 20/mi
it can be concluded that these canals should always be lined, no matter which
soil type they pass through. In the case of major canals (say, with a capa-
city over 100 cusecs), the benefits in terms of reduced water logging and
reduced costs for earthwork and structures 1/ often are quite substanEial.
The cosi for lining of the major canals are typically between Rs 20 m and
Rs 30 m . Consequently, on account of reduced seepage losses alone, it is
justified to line all major canals (i.e. with a capacity over 100 cusecs) in
medium clay loam and more pervious soils. Taking into account the additional
benefits from lining and the fact that the aquifer in impervious clay soils
usually is low yielding and, thus, groundwater development is of minor
importance, it can be concluded that, as a general rule, also major canals
should be lined in impervious clay loams.
1/   Usually in the order of 10-40% of the cost of earthwork and structures.

IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
Selection of MIP Cropping Patterns
General
1.        For the purposes of this credit five agricultural zones are
delineated. Major differences in climate and soil are assigned to dif-
ferent zones although considerable variation exists in cropping patterns
within each zone due to local market demands, availability of irrigation
water, credit, transportation and farmer preference. Agricultural statis-
tics are gathered by villages, then combined to talikas and then for the
19 districts of the State. Since the village and taluka statistics are
difficult to examine on a statewide basis, for this project entire districts
have been assigned to a single zone. The major features of the agricultural
zones are discussed below. The Appendix is concluded with guidelines for
the selection of cropping patterns.
Zone I - Kutch and Banaskantha
2.        Kutch and Banaskantha districts are characterized by low rainfall
and sandy soils. Pearl millet (45% of the cropped area) fodder and grain
sorghum (20%), pulses (10%) are the predominant crops. There is very limited
irrigation from surface sources. Rabi crops and perennials are of minor
importance in the zone and only produced with irrigation.
3.        The soils are coarse in texture with satisfactory internal drain-
age. A body of medium depth black soil occurs near Bhug. Soil salinity in
the Rann and near the coast is general. Low rainfall and salinity are prin-
cipal restraints to crop production in the zone. With stock enterprises will
occur. It is unlikely that enough water will be available for large scale
reclamation and farming of presently saline areas.
Zone II - Saurashtra
4.        All of the Saurashtra peninsula (Amreli, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar,
Junagadh, Rajkot and Surendranagar) is placed in this single zone although
differences in soils and cropping patterns are apparent especially along



91
ANNEX 2
Appendix 1
Page 2
the coastal plains. The most important crops are groundnut (40%), cotton
(17%), pearl millet (20%) and sorghum (13%). Along the coast in the
better rainfall areas with littoral soils, sugarcane and fruit crops
(mangos, bananas) are locally important. In all areas, minor crops such
as pigeon peas or maize may be mixed with the dominant crops; cotton and
groundnuts are interplanted in some areas. Rabi and perennial crops are
of little importance in the zone except with irrigation.
5.        The central portion of Saurahtra is characterized by low hills
or residual soils alternating with small alluvial basins. The coastal
soils are generally deeper alluvial characterized by a shallow water table
and some small areas of localized salinity. Groundwater resources are
quite limited and without guidance farmers tend to develop too many shallow
wells in limited areas so demand exceeds recharge capacity.
6.        The Saurashtra is the main area for groundnut production:  the
carryover of water for irrigation at planting and one early season irri-
gation will permit earlier planting, thus, increasing yields. In project
areas additional water will be available for irrigation during dry spells
in the kharif season. Earlier planting of groundnuts and cotton and irri-
gation during kharif dry spells should increase and stabilize crop yields.
In addition, the assurance of water will, by reducing risk, encourage
the farmer to apply fertilizers, crop protection practices and establish
higher plant populations.
7.        Some increase in the area of cash crops; cotton to 20%, groundnuts
45% of planted area is projected, but pearl millet, sorghum and pulses for
home consumption will remain important. In the coastal areas, where good
quality water is available, there may be more fruit crops and sugarcane.
Wheat acreage will be expanded when irrigation water is available during
the rabi season.
Zone III - South Gujarat
8.        Broach, Bulsar, Surat and Dangs districts are the high rainfall
area of the State (1,000-2,000 mm). Paddy is important, as are forage
crops for dairy and other animals. Considering the zone as a whole, the
most important crops are cotton (29%), livestock forages (16%), paddy (15%)
and grain sorghum (12%). About 85% of the area is planted during the
kharif (including the perennial crops). Rabi crops are planted in 14% of
the gross sown area. On the west side of the zone is a large alluvial
coastal plain capable of the production of many perennial crops. Surface
drainage problems are common in this area due to heavy rainfall and low
slopes.
9.        Few medium irrigation projects are contemplated for this area.
The present needs are for better water management in the coastal areas.
Bananas, paddy, sugarcane and livestock feed will continue to be important
crops in the coastal area. The inland areas will continue with cotton,
paddy and sorghum and the most important crops.

Zone IV - Central Gujarat
10.       Within the districts of Baroda, Kaira and Panchmahals, there are
two sub-zones--the eastern hills, and the plains and coastal area. The hills
are undulating shallow to medium depth black soils and small alluvial areas
suitable for irrigation. The large plain is mostly good deep black soils
but in the coastal area drainage and salinity are common problems.
11.       Rainfall is higher in the south and favors the longer season kharif
crops of cotton, groundnuts, sorghum and paddy. In the northeast maize and
pearl millet dominate although there is also paddy and groundnuts. A few
perennial tree crops, especially mango and citrus, are produced. Cotton and
pearl millet are the most important crops in the plains area and there is an
area of tobacco in Kaira. Considering in the entire zone the most important
crops are: cotton 23%, paddy 16%, maize 13%, pearl millet 12%, wheat 8%,
tobacco 5% and groundnuts 5%. Rabi crops account for about 15% on the area
sown.
Zone V - North Gujarat
12.       The districts of Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Mehsana and Sabarkantha
are each quite distinctive. The eastern hills of zone IV extend north to
Sabarkantha and maize is the most important crop. The majority of Mehsana
and parts of Sabarkantha and Ahmedabad are loamy sands where pearl millet
and cotton are the characteristic crops. Finally, on the west side are the
cay alluvial soils which separate the mainland from the Saurashtra peninsula,
where wheat is an important crop.
13.       The most important crops are:  cotton 26%, pearl millet 25%,
wheat 16%, sorghum 10% and groundnut 7%. Rabi crops occupy 18% of the
cropped area and are indicative of the intensity of tubewell irrigation.
