MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$115.5 MILLION
TO THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC FOR A DECENTRALIZATION AND
IMPROVEMENT OF SECONDARY EDUCATION AND POLYMODAL EDUCATION
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.  I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Argentine Republic for the equivalent of US$115.5 million to help
finance a project to improve Argentina's recently-decentralized secondary education system.
The loan would have a maturity of 15 years and a grace period of five years with loan
amortization based on level repayments of principal.
2.  Subloans to the Provinces shall be made under the same terms and conditions of the
Loan with respect to repayment period, interest rate, commitment charge and currency
provisions.
3.  Background. Following a severe economic crisis in the 1980s, Argentina embarked on
a comprehensive program to stabilize and restructure its economy. Inflation, which exceeded
1,300 percent annually in 1990, stood at less than 4 percent for 1994. Economic growth
improved (GDP increased by 6 percent in 1993, and by 7.1 percent in 1994), although
growth is expected to be very low for 1995. Fiscal performance at the federal level has also
improved, thanks in part to an increased tax effort, privatization of state-owned industries,
and reductions in federal employment. These measures have also been accompanied by
substantial reform and reorganization in the social sectors, which has had as a primary
strategy the decentralization of service provision to the provincial governments. In spite of
these recent improvements, however, the establishment of a solid base to foster long-term
economic growth remains an important national challenge. The long-term success of the
current economic program will depend in large part on increases in productivity and
competitiveness in world markets, which in turn will depend on effective investments in
human resources.
4.  Secondary education, as an entry point to the labor market, is a particularly crucial area
in this regard. Currently, secondary education in Argentina is characterized by poor quality
and low internal efficiency. A 1994 nation-wide sample survey of secondary students'
academic achievement shows that, on average, students scored less than 50 percent of
answers correctly in the areas of mathematics and Spanish. Nationwide, repetition rates
average 10 percent per year and some 40 percent of each cohort of students drops out before
completing the four-year cycle. On average, in the selected provinces of this project,
repetition is 14.1 percent and the drop-out rate is 46 percent. High dropout and low
achievement levels are partly due to inefficient management and inadequate spending on
educational materials and other educational inputs. Overall spending on education was
severely affected by the economic crisis of the 1980s, averaging only 3.1 percent of GDP
from 1980 to 1993. Low public investment in the sector and a concentration of educational
expenditures on personnel have also led to the deterioration and overcrowding of school
buildings. In many provinces, secondary schools share physical space with primary schools
or occupy unsuitable locations. In addition, internal productivity is low, as reflected by
student-teacher ratios which average approximately 8 to 1 in the participating project



- 2 -
provinces. Although community groups (Cooperadoras) assist with school rehabilitation and
provision of basic school equipment, their resources are insufficient to fill the gap resulting
from the crisis which has affected the public sector. The private non-subsidized sector,
which represents 28 percent of total enrollments, has remained relatively unchanged during
this period, serving mostly upper-income groups.
5.   To address quality and efficiency problems in the sector, Government has started to
implement a far-reaching reform embodied in the new Federal Education Law (FEL) of
1993. The FEL provides a framework for reorganizing educational management and the
internal structure of the educational system. A central component of the Government's
strategy, which is being supported by the Bank, is the decentralization from the federal level
to the provinces of educational provision, financing, and management.' Decentralization
was carried out for primary schools in 1978, and was completed in 1994 for national
secondary schools. The FEL has redefined the roles of the central and provincial
governments. Provinces now finance and administer all public pre-university education while
the central government provides policy guidance, establishes minimum curricular content,
monitors student achievement, and implements compensation programs targeted to poor
schools and/or regions. Other objectives outlined by the FEL include: (i) raising
compulsory education from 7 to 10 years, including one year of pre-school; and (ii) changing
the curriculum of each cycle, converting the primary level into a General Basic Education
cycle and shifting the secondary level from two specific tracks (professional and academic) to
a polymodal cycle that will be focused on more general skills and competencies. The Bank
has supported this reform in approving a (First) Decentralization and Improvement of
Secondary Education Project (Ln.3794-AR). 2
6.   Project Objectives. This project will have the same objectives as those of the first
project, for seven additional Provinces (Buenos Aires, Chaco, Corrientes, Entre Rios, Salta,
Santa Cruz, and Tucuman) and the Municipality of Buenos Aires 3. These objectives are to:
(a) strengthen institutional capacity in the Provincial Ministries of Education (PMEs) under a
decentralized framework; (b) increase the quality and efficiency of secondary education; and
1.   The Bank has been a strong advocate of decentralization as a means of addressing sectoral problems:
Sector work (Bank Country Study, Argentina: Reallocating Resources for Improvement of Education, 1991) and
a Social Sector Management Technical Assistance Loan, SSMTAL (Loan 2984-AR) have provided the
groundwork for many interventions including those in the first and proposed in this second project.
2.   The seven provinces included in the first project are Cordoba, La Pampa, Mendoza, Misiones, Neuqudn,
Rio Negro and Santa Fe.
3.   These provinces were selected based on the following criteria: (i) signed Transfer Agreement for
secondary schools; (ii) commitment of the provinces to participate in the National Management Information
System (NMIS) and National Student Assessment System (NSAS); (iii) a satisfactory diagnosis of the provincial
education sector and project proposal; (iv) willingness to carry out reforms to improve productivity and
efficiency in the sector; and (v) need to improve coverage and quality as reflected by educational indicators.
Additionally, final selection was contingent on PMEs' completion of specific tasks outlined for each step of
project preparation, pre-appraisal, and appraisal.



- 3 -
(c) enhance physical capacity to serve the secondary-school-aged population more effectively.
The Province of Buenos Aires subproject will follow a more simplified design.4
7.   Project Description. Each subproject in the selected provinces will include three broad
components. The institutional strengthening component amount (US$32.3 million including
contingencies, approximately 20% of total project cost), will include: (i) improvement of
educational administration, budgeting and planning capacity5; (ii) the development of a
management information system; (iii) the development of a student assessment system; and
(iv) the training of administrative and management staff. The educational quality
improvement component (US$56.3 million including contingencies, approximately 34% of
total project cost), includes: (i) provision of in-service training and other programs for
upgrading the skills of teachers and administrators; (ii) provision of textbooks and
teaching/learning materials; (iii) strengthening of curriculum development in basic skill areas
(such as language and math); (iv) strengthening of school-based management; and (v) support
for school-based quality improvement projects. The rehabilitation and expansion of physical
infrastructure component (US$67.0 million including contingencies, approximately 41 % of
total project cost), involves mostly repair and renovation of school facilities, and
establishment of systems for rational use and sustained maintenance of buildings. Project
management expenditures account for the remaining 5 percent of project costs. The content
of each provincial subproject varies, based on the specific needs and priorities of the
Provincial Ministries of Education.
8.   Project Cost and Financing. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$164.4
million based on prices of April 1995. The total foreign exchange cost is estimated at
US$18.3 million, or about 11 percent of the total cost. The proposed project would be
financed by a Bank loan of US$115.5 million or 71 percent of total project cost. The loan
would cover 100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures and about 84 percent of estimated
local costs (excluding taxes). The Government of Argentina would finance the remaining
US$48 million (including duties and taxes). A breakdown of project costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursement
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Argentina are presented in Schedules C and D respectively.
9.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The secondary education projects are a priority for
the government sectoral objectives, and respond to the urgent need to improve this education
level to ensure the trainability, adaptability, and productivity of the labor force in a
4.   Buenos Aires Province's education system is too large to be fully addressed by a project of this
magnitude. Thus, the subproject of this province will have only two subcomponents of the Institutional
Strengthening component described in para. 5, and a set of studies. The objectives will be to support the
province's short term participation in the national education reform, analyze its secondary education sector, and
develop a more comprehensive future project of its own, that could be financed by the Bank.
5.   During project preparation the PMEs carried out a diagnosis of sector inefficiencies based on available
data at the provincial level. Additionally, each of the eight provinces agreed to carry out a Sector Management
Productivity Study (SMPS). These SMPSs, financed by the NMCE and conducted through competitively
awarded contracts with consultant firms, will: (i) refine the diagnoses earlier carried out by the PMEs; and (ii)
provide recommendations on the basis of which the provinces will prepare their own action plans for improving
sector efficiency.



decentralized framework. The involvement of the Bank in this project complements ongoing
activities of the Bank and other donors in the sector 6. The proposed loan is also fully
consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board on May 4, 1995.
10.    Project Preparation. The project was prepared by the Provincial Ministries of
Education (PMEs) with the assistance of the National Ministry of Culture and Education
(NMCE). To develop and maintain a sense of ownership, provincial education
administrators and technical staff took an active role in defining their subprojects. Project
preparation was financed by grant funds from the Japanese Government.
11.    Project Implementation and Monitoring. Project implementation would be
coordinated by NMCE's National Project Coordination Unit (NPCU), which would be
strengthened accordingly. Nevertheless, implementation would be carried out in a
decentralized framework by each participating province which would have its own project
coordination unit (PPCU). To strengthen project long term objectives, a set of Impact
Indicators and Monitoring Indicators were agreed between the Federal and provincial
governments and the Bank. The institutional strengthening activities to be financed under the
project will provide technical support for effective project monitoring. Furthermore, to
avoid delays in subprojects implementation, as well as to promote competition among the
participating provinces. The loan agreement include the possibility to reallocate unused
funds which could become available if a participating province: (i) had not signed the
subsidiary loan agreement within the eight months period following the loan effectiveness;
(ii) requires the reduction of the amount of its subloan; or (iii) had disbursed less than 20
percent of its subloan after a period of 30 months after loan effectiveness. In either case the
NMCE in agreement with the Bank, could propose the use of the available funds to finance
subprojects of replacing provinces.
12.    Project Sustainability. The effect of the proposed project on total sector costs, and
the ability of the participating provincial govemments to sustain the expenditures that will
result from project implementation, has been assessed. The assessment of the expenditures
resulting from project implementation has shown that this increase is within the financial
capacity of the provinces, especially when considering the importance provincial govemments
give to the education sector, and the gains in management efficiency to be achieved through
institutional strengthening. Recurrent expenditures resulting from the project are expected to
range from approximately US$300,000 per year in the provinces of Buenos Aires, Chaco and
Santa Cruz to US$1.1 million per year in the Province of Entre Rios. From the point of
view of sustainability, the additional recurrent expenditures would represent in most cases
less than 1 percent of the estimated sector budget projected for the year 2000 and less than 5
percent of the forecast secondary education budget of the PMEs.
6.   The Provincial Development I Project (Loan 3280-AR) finances investments in primary education
infrastructure. The Higher Education Improvement Project would support the implementation of legal,
management and administrative reforms that have recently been initiated by the government. The Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB) is financing a program to support basic education (pre-school and primary)
focusing on problems similar to those faced at the secondary level, especially with regard to quality and
efficiency.



13. Lessons Learned. There has been only one education project completed in Argentina
to date, the Vocational Training and Technical Education Project (Ln. 1905-AR, approved in
1980). This US$58 million project aimed at improving institutional capacity and expanding
the quality of Argentina's vocational training system. The project was canceled seven years
after approval, disbursing less than 2% of project funds because of deteriorating economic
conditions, political turmoil, project complexity and changes in project administration. The
First Decentralization of Secondary Education project is expected to become effective by
August 1995. Bank research on secondary education emphasizes the importance of the
following: improving general education, promoting better access (especially among the poor),
supporting teacher training and provision of learning inputs, and supporting institutional
strengthening. These lessons have been incorporated into the design of both the first and the
second projects.
14. Poverty Category. School construction under the project will be targeted to areas in
which schools are overcrowded or in need of renovation, which are generally located in poor
communities. Schools serving poor children will also be disproportionately benefitted by the
provision of educational materials, which are a key factor in improving educational quality.
Further, the provision of information systems and improved management capacity will also
enable the provincial governments to better target investments to the needs of the poor.
15. Environmental Impact. The project does not present environmental risks other than
the relatively minor ones associated with school construction and maintenance activities.
These will be addressed in the design and approval stage of investment subprojects. The
project has an environmental rating of "C."
16. Program Objective Categories. Within the broad category of human resource
development, the project's objectives are to improve the efficiency and quality of secondary
education in the participating PMEs.
17. Participatory Approach. The proposed project, like its predecessor, seeks to support
decentralization of education and transfer of authority over schools to levels closer to
individual communities. In a broad sense participation was achieved during preparation
through involving the provinces in all aspects of preparation. In addition, all provinces have
incorporated subcomponents for intra-provincial decentralization and for strengthening
school-based management. Four provinces (Chaco, Entre Rios, Salta and Santa Cruz) have
also incorporated subcomponents to provide school-based grants for quality improvement
based upon participatory planning approaches at the level of the individual school.
18. Key Issues and Actions. The Govemment has already presented to the Bank: (a) the
final versions of terms of reference, revised on the basis of the early findings of the Sector
Management Productivity Studies (SMPSs), for consultant services to implement institutional
and administrative reorganization, modemization of norms and procedures, and strengthening
of planning capacity; and (b) final version of the technical plans and specifications, and
preliminary designs, for all civil works to be included during the first and second year of the
project. During negotiations, agreements or assurances were obtained from the Govemment
on the following: (a) updated analyses of sector inefficiencies and project impact indicators
and targets, for each province, based upon early findings of the SMPSs; (b) assurances of
annual budget allocations for each year of project implementation at the provincial level; (c)



- 6 -
maintenance of PPCU staff or similarly qualified professionals during project
implementation; (d) agreement on the scope and content of the project's Mid-Term Review,
with special attention to the implementation of the action plans based on the
recommendations of the SMPSs, to address sector inefficiencies. As a condition of loan
effectiveness, the Bank would require: (a) at least one signed subsidiary loan agreement; (b)
the establishment of the PPCU in the same province, with signed subsidiary loan agreement;
and (c) an action plan, based on the recommendations of the SMPSs, in the same province
with signed subsidiary agreement and establishment of the respective PPCU. As a condition
of disbursement in each remaining province, the Bank would require: (a) a signed subsidiary
loan agreement; (b) the establishment of the PPCU; and (c) an action plan, based upon the
recommendation of the SMPS, to address previously identified sector inefficiencies.
19. Expected Benefits. The project would: (a) contribute to a more educated and trainable
workforce by raising students' cognitive achievement and problem-solving skills; (b) increase
the opportunity of children in low-income areas to receive a better quality education, thus
increasing their possibilities in the labor market and opportunities for social mobility; (c) help
consolidate the decentralization process by strengthening provincial institutions, thus
generating more efficient responses to local problems; and (d) help increase sector
productivity, thus creating net savings for the education sector which could be reallocated to
inputs which have a high impact on educational quality (e.g., textbooks and teacher training).
The project will directly benefit over 550,000 secondary students--roughly 25 percent of the
nation's total secondary education enrollment, not taking into account the Province of Buenos
Aires enrollments.
20. A quantitative estimate of benefits arising from the project was made on the basis of
assumptions considered reasonable from experience in the sector. These include: (a) a
reduction in repetition rates from an average of about 14 percent per year to about 10 percent
per year in the seven provinces7; (b) a reduction in the current dropout rate by
approximately 15 percent by project completion; (c) improvements in the student/teacher
ratio from an average of 7:1 to 9:1; and (d) administrative savings equal to at least five
percent of current expenditures through organizational and administrative reforms. If these
assumptions hold, they would together result in potential benefits accruing to project
provinces of US$442 million per year upon the completion of the project.
21. Risks and Safeguards. The main risks associated with the project can be classified as
direct and indirect. Direct risks are: (a) limited implementation capacity at the provincial
level as well as limited sectoral experience with Bank-financed projects; and (b) slow
implementation of new policy decisions arising from the new FEL such as the new
curriculum content. Indirect risks mainly involve macroeconomic difficulties that could
impair the provinces' financial capacity to assure availability of counterpart funds.
22. Direct risks will be minimized by: (a) strengthening the NPCU established for the
(First) Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary Education Project with additional
technical staff to perform specific functions of monitoring and supervising the provincial
subprojects in the field; (b) ensuring coordination between the NPCU and the Provincial
7.  The Province of Buenos Aires is not included in the estimates of project benefits, since this project will
not cover direct quality investments in that Province.



- 7 -
Project Coordination Units (PPCUs) which would also have a small but highly qualified
staff; (c) prior agreement with the NPCU and PPCUs on annual targets for the project; and
(d) prior agreement on technical assistance activities and training that will be supported by
the project, including those related to project implementation. Indirect risks will be
minimized by ensuring the availability of counterpart funds through the co-financing
mechanisms in place between the federal and provincial governments. These risks would be
further mitigated by allowing for the reallocation of the project funds to a province not
originally in the project, as explained in para. 11.
23. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
