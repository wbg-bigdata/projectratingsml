EKORANDWM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSF0 CREDIT TO NEPAL
FOR A FIFTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT.
1.   I submit for your approval the following report and recomndation on a
proposed development credit to Nepal for SDR40.1 million (US$55.0 million
equivalent), on standard IDA terms with maturity of 40 years to help finance a
fifth telecommunications project. The proceeds of the credit would be relent to
the Nepal Telecommunications Corporation (NTC) for 15 years, including five years
of grace, with variable interest based upon the six month LIBOR plus 3X per
annum. DANIDA, FiRNIDA and JICA are co-financing this project through grants to
His Majesty' s Government (HMG). DANIDA and FINNIDA grants will be on-lent to NTC
on terms similar to this IDA credit; the JICA grant will be passed on as an HNG
equity contribution.
2.   CguUtr/eotor Backg           Over the past decade HMG has increasingly
recognized the important role which effective telecommunications play in
political, social and economic development. Given Nepal's mountainous terrain
and Xathmandu Valley's separation from the densely populated areas of the Terai
near the India Border, telecommunications has become a vital element in govern-
ment administration and commercial operations. Furthermore, during the late
1980's, an estimated 9X-10 p.a. of Nepal's foreign exchange earnings (excluding
foreign aid) was derived from tourism for which telecommunications is of primary
importance.     Currently  Nepal  has  one  of  the  lowest  densities  of
telecommunications service in Asia, although from 1985 to 1990 services grew at
a rate of 221 p.a. This relatively high growth was snainly the result of the low
starting base. Despite low service penetration, the facilities provided are
generally modern and perform reasonably well because of the sector's relatively
recent development.
3.   The Ministry of Communications (MOC) is responsible for communications in
Nepal.  Under this Ministry different services are provided by the Nepal
Television Corporation (ITVC), the Postal Service Department, the Broadcasting
Services Development Committee (BSDC), and the Nepal Telecouuunications
Corporation (NTC). NTC is responsible for all public telecommunications
services. While dedicated networks by other public sector entities are not
prohibited, no other entity owns or operates dedicated network facilities of
significant size. NTC's operational and project performance has been gradually
improving, primarily due to the efforts of top management and support from HMG.
NTC has consistently met or exceeded its covenanted target of achieving a 121
financial rate of return; increases in telephone tariffs adopted in November 1991
in accord with IDA recommendations are expected to provide a basis for NTC's
continued satisfactory financial performance. However, there is still much room
for further improvement, and consultants contracted under the ongoing IDA
telecommunications project have highlighted the need for: (a) extensive
improvements in management techniques and systems because of the sixfold increase
in assets and the rapid change in technology; and (b) reviewing the existing
tariff structure and level, because domestic rates have been virtually unchanged
for five years, while the relatively high international rates have been adjusted
wlth the exchange rate variation, leading to low local and high international
rates.



-2-
4.   Against this background MMG has tentatively set two major targets for
telecommuications development in Nepal: (a) to significantly extend reliable
telecommunicatLons services to all districts, and (b) to Increass telephone
density to one telephone (about 0.8 telephone lines) per 100 population by the
year 2000. AlthouAgh their achievement is unlikely to satisfy demand fully, these
appear to be resonable, viablQ targets. The targeted density of 0.8 telephone
lines per 100 population would require installation of 129,000 lines during 1991-
2000.
5.   Prolect Objectlves.  In preparation of its Eighth Five Year (1992-1997)
development plan HllO has proposed an investment project that would support the
expansion  of  the  country's  telecommunicatlons  system, strengthen  NTC's
institutional capacity and fund NTC's investment program for Ml-FT95.  To
achieve  this  the  project  aims  to:  (a)  increase  the  proportion  of
telecommunications services demand met in urban areas; (b) provide modern
telecommunications facilities in all 75 districts and some 30 sub-districts and
provide 60,250 new llnes by 1996; (c) improve the perforance quality of the
telecommunications services; (d) further strengthen TC,' s management capabilities
and system; (e) maintain and improve NTC's financlal performance; and (f) assist
MG to review the appropriateness of the sector structure and develop a plan for
reform.
6.   Prolect Descriytion.  The proposed project, to be implemented over six
years, would consist of two components. The irvstment comuone=t (US$112.5
milllon, including contingencies) and ineludes provision of Equipment & Serviees
and Civil Works, in partieular: (a) telephone switching exchange, outside plant
and ancillary equipment to connect about 60,000 new telephone lines, in both
urban and rural areas, (b) digital transmission links to replace the old Pokhara-
Nepalgunj analog link in the main transmission network and to extend secondary
and rural transmission links to new distriets, (c) equipment to extend data and
text services as appropriate throughout Nepal and potentially to all 75
distriets, and (d) switching and transmission equipment to extend nation-wide and
internattonal subscriber trunk dialing. The second component would provide
t=chnical aLstance funding of US$4.0 million (ineluding contingencies) for (a)
NTC instltutional strengthening (US$2.7 million, of whieh US$0.2 million are
financed by IDA, remaining amount is financed by DANDA and FIVNIDA), ineluding
consultant services to support improving the integration between technical and
financial areas, creating a corporate data base which would form the base for
billing, accounting and operational processes, and strengthening corporate
management through appropriate training, und (b) a sector organization sub-
component (US$0.3 milllon) in which the sectoral structure would be analyzed by
consultants, following which IDA would assist }BIG to develop and implement an
appropriate sector reform program. Key sectoral issues to be reviowd include:
the institutional framework for developing; and reviewing sector policy and
structure; private and public sectors' roles in delivering telecommunications
services; sector regulation; and provision of social and remote area services.
7.         The total project cost is estimated at US$116.5 million equivalent
(including contingencies and excluding interest during construction), with a
foreign exchange component of US$97.5 aillion (841). A breakdown of costs and

financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Nepal are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.  A map
highlighting the project areas, IBRD No. 23474, ts attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 10062-NEP dated April 8, 1992 is being distributed separately.
8.   Prioect Ilam          . As with previous projects, NTC will undertake all
technical construction related to the project. Where equipment installation and
operations procedures are new to NTC, suppliers will be contracted to provide
training to NTC staff and to supervise the installation and initial operation of
their respective equipment. NTC will contract out civil works for buildings,
outside plant ducts and some transmission tower works. NTC will be assisted in
detailed engineering by suppliers and consultants. For switching equipment,
suppliers will undertake detailed engineering, and IDA/NTC have already engaged
an independent consultant, funded under IDA's Trust Fund, to help with tender
preparation, evaluation and technical contract negotiations. FINNIDA will engage
a consultant to help NTC with specifications and path designs for the more
complex transmission systems. Consultant support is already being provided by
DANIDA to help NTC with detailed planning and engineering of outside plant;
additional consultant support is to be provided to help supervise construction.
Furthermore, a project supervision consultant engaged by DANIDA and managed by
IDA would assist NTC to develop and integrace its implementation plans and
undertake detailed technical supervision of the project to supplement IDA, DANIDA
and FINNIDA supervision resources.
9.   Goods and services to the value of 87X of the credit would be procured
using IDA's ICB procedures; for the remainder, direct purchase would be used to
procure proprietary equipment and international and local shopping for minor
items. Consultants would be engaged under IDA's Guidelines.
10.   Project Sustainabilitv. The project is expected to be fully sustainable
because (a) tariffs have been set to realize a satisfactory rate of return above
the cost of capital, (b) it is one of a series of previously successful projects,
(c) the now networks will be built on a sound, modern infrastructure base with
proven technology, (d) NTC is a relatively competent organization, and (e)
related institutional development will further enhance WTC's ability to operate
and maintain the project's facilities.
11.  Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement.  IDA' s involvement in
Nepal's telecommunications sector began in 1969 with a credit of $1.7 million
(Credit 166-NEP of November 1969).  Since then IDA has financed three more
operations: Credit 397-NEP for $5.5 million in June 1973, Credit 799-NEP for
$14.5 million in August 1978 and Credit 1588-NEP for $22 million in April 1986
(the ongoing Fourth Project). The June 1988 PCR for Credits 397-NEP and 799-NEP
rated these projects as  successful, with significant contributions to the
development of physical facilities, improvements of the quality of the
telecommunications services and institutional development of NTC.  The main
implementation constraints were delays in start-up, in deciding on new
technologies, in arranging financing and in the commissioning of some systems.
From the earlier projects, important lessons incorporated into the design of the



-4
proposed project were to (1) make more realistic implementation schedules, (ii)
assist NTC in making organizational changes before the project starts, (iii)
advance planning for procurement to facilitate timely implementation, and (iv)
help NTC finalize financing arrangements in time for project implementation.
12.   Rasionale for IDA Involvement.  Under the earlier projects IDA played a
significant role in the sector's evolution and provided a coordinating focus for
assistance from other sources.  H10  values this leadership role (in both
assisting NWG to develop sector policy and mobilUzing funds).   Thus IDA's
continued involvement would help achieve several important objectives in the
development of Nepal's tolecommunications sector. First, it would broaden the
focus of reform to examine the sector's overall organization. The proposed
project is part of IDA's proposed 1-ng-tera involvement ln the sector intended
to make it a contributor to sustained economic growth, a positive agent in the
country's socio-economic development and largely self-reliant for meeting its
investment needs.   IDA's cross-country experience in the tolecommunications
sector in developing countries is directly relevant in advising HNC on sector
structure, management and organization, financial relations with the operating
entity, tariff structure, level and adjustment policies, and the timing and
opportunity for introducing elements of competition and private sector
participation. Second, IDA involvement would assist HNG maintain a necessary
balance between physical and institutional development of NTC. IDA involvement
would provide NTC with assistance for its institutional development -- in
particular, strengthening of planning and project management, management
training, extension of the use of computers for daily operations, and general
strategic-technical guidance. Finally, IDA involvement would also contribute to
economy in investment costs of equipment through procurement pro-planning and the
use of ICB for IDA-financed items and ICB prices as a benchmark for other
procurement.
13. Agreed Actipns. NTC has agreed to (a) implement, December 15, 1993 a
revised organization structure and review and improve its human resource
management arrangements; (b) appoint by June 30, 1993, management consultants,
acceptable to IDA, for initiating and implementing a management development
program; (c) furnish to IDA for each year beginning 1993, unaudited financial
accounts by January 15, and audited financial statements and accounts by July 15
of the following year; (d) review annually with IDA progress on its institutional
development program (IDP) and performace against agreed operational targets and
take appropriate easures identified in those reviews to improve the IDP or its
operational performance; and (s) ensure its annual rate of return on revalued
assets is at least 12X after tax and before interest. Additionally, HMO has
agreed to (a) implement a detailed action plan for preventing the accumulation
of new arrears and eliminate arrears annually through a credit arrangement in
relation to NTC's payments to HMG and (b) engage consultants, by December 15,
1992, to review the sector's structure and policies and, based on the
consultants' report and with IDA assistance, develop and implement an appropriate
sector reform program. During negotiations, the understanding was reached that,
HNG/NTC will engage a consultant in time to prepare a report reviewing the tariff
structure by December 15, 1993, and that the joint review, by IDA and HNG/NTC,
of the consultant's recommendations will take place during the first quarter of
1994. Conditions of effectiveness are (a) the signing of a Subsidiary Credit



Agreement bftween H1G and NTC ecceptable to IDA, Including on-lending
arrangements for the proceeds of the IDA credit to NTC; and (b) that IDA should
have receLved for its approval bid documents for the procurement of swLtchLig
equipment.
14.  FAMLAA W WEXa Aggets. The proposed project would not have a significant
onvironmental i4maet, as construction would be lilmted to same minor site
clearing and access roads needed to reach transmission tower sites.  Road and
verge surfaces will be effected by the laying of ducts for underground cable, but
IDA will ensure that civil works contracts require full surface restoration. The
disruption of virgin land is expected to be minimal.
15.   Project Benefits.  The proposed project's benefits would accrue to all
sectors of the economy through improved access to telecommunications facllities
and improved service quality. Users would benefit from the almost doubling in
access, from 77,700 installed lines to 138,500 installed lines, and around 50,000
new subscribers would gain access to the network.   Additionally, business
activities would benefit from expanded transmission facilities for data and
information.   Extended facilities would widen the reach of emergency and
government services and add to the quallty of life. HKG would also benefit,
first as a user of the services, and second through increased transfers from the
sector. Grants from DANIDA and FINNIDA would be on-lent to NTC on commercial
terms, generating an inflow of funds to HMG. Furthermore, increased payments
from NTC to HMG for sales tax and income tax would add to total net transfers of
around US$104 million in the period 1992-2000 (equivalent to 2.5 years of NTC
revenues). Continued emphasis on NTC's institutional strengthening would improve
its performance as an effective telecoumunications entity operating on a sound
commercial basis, increasing its responsiveness to users and the cost
effectiveness of its investment, as shown by a projected economic internal rate
of return of 222.
16.   Laka.   The project has been designed to minimize toehnical risks.
However, implementation, and hence project benefits, would be impacted by delays
in procurement and shortfalls in NTC's institutional capacity to implement the
project. These risks have been recognized and actions initiated to minimize
their impact: the various cotsultancies referred to in para. 8.
17.   Re         ion. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply wlth
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recom_end that the Executive
Directors approve it.
