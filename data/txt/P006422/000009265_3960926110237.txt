MENORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
0N A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE STATE OF MINAS GERAIS OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR THE MINAS GERAIS FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the State of Minas Gerais of the Federative Republic of Brazil for
U.S.$48.5 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan
would be repayable in 15 years on a fixed amortization schedule, including
3 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would
help finance a forestry development project. Funds for reforestation
subloans woold be passed by the Borrower to the Minas Gerais Development
Bank (BDMG), which would either onlend directly to subborrowers with a
spread of 22 or pass the funds to participating commercial banks. In the
latter case, BDMG would charge a one-half percent administrative charge and
the comuercial banks would charge a 1.5? spread to subborrovers. There
would be a cap of 10? above monetary correction on the interest charged to
subborrowers during the first year of project implementation and a cap of
11? thereafter. The Sta:e would assume the foreign exchange risk. For the
credit financing reforestation there would be a 14 yea. amortization
including up to 7 years grace, and, for credit financing charcoal
manufacturing infrastructure, there would be a 4 year amortization
including up to 1 year grace.
Background
2.       Forestry and forest industries account for 112 of the GDP of the
State of Minas Gerais and about 390,000 jobs. The State Forestry Institute
(IEF) which receives less than 12 of the State's total budget is
responsible for formulating, coordinating and executing forest policy in
the State. The strategy for forestry development in the State includes the
promotion of industrial and small-scale reforestation to improve supplies
of wood to the vital steel and pulp industries while at the same time
improving conservation of the remaining native forests in the State. IEF
is one of Brazil's best state forestry services and it has a very
successful small-ecale reforestation program financed, in part, by two Bank
rural development project loans. However, IEF needs strengthening to
accomplish its sizable responsibilities.
3.       Forestry production, and in particular, charcoal production for
the iron and steel industry (the State"s most important industry which
produces 852 of Brazil's charcoal-based pig iron and steel) has been one of
the most rapidly growing subsectors in the past decade. This growth,
however, has taken its toll on the State's forests. In 1911, 48S of the
State's area was under undisturbed forests. Today, with the exception of a
few small state parks, there are virtually no virgin forest areas left,
although an estimated 25.7 million ha (43? of the total land area of the
State) are classified as Oforest' iands. Most of these forests, however,
are heavily degraded as a result of repeated wood removal, lack of
management and frequent and poorly controlled burning. Furthermore, in
response to the oil crisis and increasing prices of petroleum in the late



1970's, Government policies promoted the substitution of nationally
produced alcohol, firewood, charcoal, coal and oil for imported ft-els,
especially in energy-intensive industries such as lime, cement, ceramics
and grain-drying. The fuel oil substitution program was completed in Minas
Gerais in 1984, by which time 30Z of the fuel oil consumed by industry was
replaced with charcoal, the consumption of which increased by 50? from
1982 to 1985.  These developments have given added urgency to expanding
reforestation since, despite the planting of nearly 2 million ha in the
State since 1967, more than POX of the State's wood and charcoal production
still comes from native forests. The increasing industrial demand for
fuelvood and charcoal (produced with less than state-of-the art technology)
has led to an increase in the rate at which native forests have been cut,
and these cannot be sustained by natural regrowth.
4.       In general the resources for financing large-scale industrial
reforestation in Minas Gerais are quite limited; the Federal Government has
gradually reducel its fiscal incentive program (FISET) and only limited
credit is available (through the National Economic and Social Development
Bank-BNDES); this credit is restricted to Brazilian firms (several of the
larger potential subborrowers for the proposed line of credit in this
Project are multinationals). In order to provide alternative sources of
financing, the State Government approached the Bank for assistance for a
forestry project which, in addition to providing credit resources would
also strengthen the State's institutional capacity for supplying forestry
conservation and research services. The project was prepared by the State
Gover,jment with FAO/CP and Bank assistance.
Rational for Bank Involvement
5.       The Bank's strategy in Brazil is aimed at promoting sustainable
economic growth. At present, the future growth of some major industries
(e.g., iron aLnd steel) in one of the most important industrial states in
the country, Minas Gerais, is in jeopardy becAuse the natural resource base
(forests) on which these industries depend, is being depleted. At present,
the supply of financial resources needed to support both the private and
public investments required to protect and expand that resource base are
limited and shrinking. The Bank's involvement in the proposed project is
essential for providing the necessary financial support to help to
establish a more cost-effective and sustainable alternati're to FISET for
financing industrial reforestation and to strengthen a public forestry
development and conservation institution (IEF).
Proiect Obiectives
6.       The project's objectives are to: (a) increase industrial wood and
charcoal production by expanding reforestation, increasing native forest
productivity through better management and improving charcoal manufacturing
technology; (b) reduce degradation of the native forests through
rehabilitation and conservation; (c) alleviate rural poverty through
employment generation; (d) improve environmental protection through
conservation education, state parks management and environmental research;
and (e) strengthen the management capabilities of the IEF.
Proiect DescriRtion
7.       The project would finance: (a) the planting of up to 165,000 ha of
industrial-scale forests and the building of charcoal manufacturing



infrastructure through a line of credit administered by the Minas Gerais
Development Bank - BDMG, which has experience handling similar lines of
credit. The credit line would finance up to 802 of any reforestation
subproject's costs (except land) but no more than 502 of the total costs of
all reforestation subprojects financed. Funds would be onlent at a
variable interest rate equivalent to the cost of Bank funds plus 22 with a
cap of 10% above full monetary correction for the life of subloans approved
during the first year of project implementation and a cap of 112 for
subloans approved thereafter. For the credit financing reforestation,
there would be a 14 year amortization including up to seven years grace,
and for credit financing charcoal manufacturing infrastructure, there would
be a four year amortization including up to one year grace; the State of
Minas Gerais would bear the foreign exchange risk (this component would
account for 84% of tctal project costs); (b) the planting of about 40,000
ha of small-scale wood lots by small farmers as a continuation of the
successful program implemented by the State Forestry Institute and financed
under the two Bank-financed Minas Cerais Rural Development projects (72 of
total project costs); (c) forestry conservation (6Z of total project costs)
including (i) control, supervision an5 management of forest harvesting,
(ii) conservation education, (iii) development of parks and reserves; (d)
institutional development to strengthen IEF (22 of total project costs);
and (e) project evaluation (1Z of total project costs). 'While general
coordination of the credit component would be handled by the BDMG, the IEF
would implement all non-credit components. General project coordination,
monitoring and evaluation would be performed by the State Secretariat of
Planning and General Coordination lSEPLAN-MG).
8.       The project, to be carried out over seven and a half years
provides funds for the credit line, civil works, equipment and materials,
consultant services anu project administration and training. The total
cost of the project is estimated at US$100 million equivalent with a
foreign exchange component of US$9.5 million (9.5Z). A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. Project expenditures incurred prior to loan signing but
after June 1, 1987, would be eligible for reimbursemernt through retroactive
financing up to US$1.0 million. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 6919-BR, dated November 3, 1987, is attached.
Agreed Actions
9.       As conditions of loan effectiveness, the State would:  (a)
allocate adequate counterpart funding in the 1988 state budget (i.e., no
less than US$2.0 million equivalent); (b) sign a subsidiary loan agreement
with BDMG; and (c) assure the prompt availability of funds for the project.
Receipt of a signed agreement between BDMG and each participating bank
satisfactory to the Bank, specifying responsibilities and subloan terms and
conditions, would be a condition of Bank disbursement for the first subloan
presented by each participating bank.
10.      Other Maior Covenants  (a) The Bank and the State would annually
review the onlending terms and conditions, including the use of the
National Treasury Bonds Index (OTN) as the basis for full monetary
correction of the subloans, and the Bank would refrain from approving
subloans if it were not in agreement with those onlending terms and



-4-
conditions; (b) the first two subloans and any subsequent subloan of US$4.0
million equivalent or more, would be submitted to the Bank for approval
before signing of the subloan contracts; (c) the annual budget proposal for
project activities would be made available to the Bank by October 31 each
year for review and agreement; (d) BDMG and the partici,!,ating banks would
appraise the proposed subprojects using BDMG's technical, financial and
economic criteria which have been reviewed by and found acceptable to the
Bank; (e) SEPLAN would maintain a unit satisfactory to the Bank to provide
for overall coordination and monitoring of the project; and (f) IEF would
maintain a project implementation unit with organization structure and
functions satisfactory to the Bank, and staffed with personnel in numbers
and with qualifications satisfactory to the Bank.
Benefits
11.      The economic rate of return of the Project has been estimated at
17S. The principal benefits to be derived from this operation includet
ti)increased economic growth through greater production of wood raw
materials from native and planted forests to supply basic manufacturing
industries (e.g., iron and steel, cement, ceramics, pulp and paper); (ii)
increased employment, especially for women in impoverisheO rural areas and
increased income of small land owners through reforestati a; (iii) improved
environmental protection, reduced erosion and reduced pressure on native
forest resources; (iv) increased State fiscal revenues through generation
of economic growth and personal income; and (v) Improved utilization of
land resources by substituting productive commercial forests for marginal
agricultural activities (i.e.. extensive grazing). It would also create
cost-effective financing which could eventually substitute for the
expensive fiscal incentive system (FISET) of the Federal Government.
Risks
12.      With the industrial-scale reforestation component, the main
project risk is that current economic uncertainties or reluctance by
commercial enterprises to borrow for projects with a long pay-back period
(with inherent associated risks) might slow disbursement of the industrial
reforestation credit component. However, the increasing demand for and
cost of charcoal, the reduced availability of wood from native forests and
the continuing reductions in FISET funds for reforestation are likely to
reduce this risk. Furthermore, the survey of potential subborrowers shows
a clear interest in borrowing for reforestation.
Recommendation
13.      I am satisfied that the proposed lcan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
