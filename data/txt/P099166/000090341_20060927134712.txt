                                  REPUBLIC OFMOLDOVA


               PROPOSEDPOVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT


                                       CREDIT SUMMARY

Borrower:     Republic o f Moldova

Amount:       SDR 6.8 million(US$10 million equivalent)

Terms:        Standard IDA Terms, with 40 years maturity, including a 10-year grace period

Objectives:   The proposed Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) for the Republic o f Moldova
              follows an intensification of the Government's reform efforts over the past several years
              and is intended to bolster and deepen those efforts. More specifically, the proposed credit
              aims to enhance the Government's ability to accelerate economic growth and improve the
              efficiency o f its social programs and public administration   - key elements in poverty
              reduction. To this end, the proposed PRSC will support selective areas o f the
              Government's reform agenda, as outlined in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
              (PRSP) and the European Union (EU)-Moldova action plan, thereby complementing and
              reinforcing other Bank Group programs in Moldova, the International Monetary Fund
              (IMF)-supported Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) and other donor activities.
              Closely aligned with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the PRSC will support the
              EGPRSP objectives of:

              Improvingthe Investment Climate. Moldova is entering a new phase in its economic
              development where consumption driven growth - based on the export o f labor and inflow
              o f remittances - can no longer be expected to sustain current growth rates over the
              medium-term.       Sustaining and accelerating future growth and poverty reduction in
              Moldova will depend on increases in domestic productivity which, in tun, will depend
              on the extent to which firms and farms address current low levels o f investment and
              innovation.   The Government's agenda focuses on further improving the investment
              climate for private sector development. These efforts will also directly contribute to
              Government efforts to improve governance and reduce corruption. Key to Moldova's
              efforts to accelerate economic growth and poverty reduction will be improving the
              performance o f the agriculture sector.       Similarly, reducing destabilizing economic
              impacts o f external energy price shocks will require improvements inenergy efficiency.

              Improvingthe Efficiency and Management of Public Resources. Better governance
              and public institutions are central to growth and poverty reduction. The EGPRSP i s
              conscious o f the constraint imposed by the insufficient functional and institutional
              adaptation o f the public administration to the requirements set by the transition from a
              centrally planned economy to a market economy.             The EGPRSP recognizes that
              establishing a modern and efficient public administration i s necessary in order to achieve
              the country's longer-term development outcomes. Increased public investment spending,
              particularly inpublic infrastructure, will be needed inorder to support Moldova's private-
              sector led growth. This will require enhancing the strategic allocation o f public resources
              by improving the (Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) process, public
              procurement practices and includingbetter public investment management. Reforms in a
              number of key sectoral areas can also improve the efficiency of public resource use,
              yielding increased fiscal space for more public investment spending without crowding
              out the private sector.

                  Strengthening Pension and Social Assistance Systems. While the recent slowdown in
                 poverty reduction highlights the need to improve the quality o f growth in Moldova, it
                  also points to the need to strengthen existing social safety nets. The Government's
                 program to improve delivery o f utility, infrastructure and social services i s reflected in
                 the EGPRSP. The PRSC would strengthen the effectiveness and future fiscal viability o f
                 the pay-as-you-go pension program by supporting efforts to complete the 1999 pension
                 reform, including efforts to unify the pension system for all types o f pensioners.
                  Improving targeting efficiency o f social assistance programs and gaining efficiency in
                 program administration will be a necessary element o f Moldova's poverty reduction
                  efforts.

Benefits:         Benefits are: (i)improved business environment and investment climate, which directly
                  contributes to changing the quality o f growth and poverty reduction in Moldova by
                  stimulating a stronger domestic supply response, particularly in the key agriculture
                  sector; (ii)a more professional civil service combined with increased transparency and
                  accountability o f public finances with improved public expenditure management and
                  strategic allocation o fresources - through better medium-term budget planning, as well as
                  strengthened procurement functions - enabling an increase in current low levels o f public
                  sector investment, particularly in rapidly deteriorating public infrastructure;        (iii)
                  strengthening existing social safety nets for vulnerable groups by completing the 1999
                  pension reform and improving the targeting efficiency o f social assistance programs.

Risks:            Primary risks to the proposed operation include: (i)    public financial management and
                  procurement systems have been strengthened but fiduciary risks remain non-negligible;
                  (ii)lowimplementation capacityatthecentral anddecentralizedlevel. Dovetailingthe
                  PRSC with other Bank Group operations and donor activities that provide detailed
                  support to capacity building helps mitigate this risk; (iii)Destabilizing external shocks,
                  such as the volatility o f energy prices and ban on Moldova exports o f wine by Russia,
                  could seriously affect public finances and delay implementation o f poverty reduction
                  measures in the PRSP. The PRSC's support to prudent fiscal policy and medium-term
                 budget planning, combined with an IMFPRGF program, mitigate these risks.

                              PROGRAMCONCEPTDOCUMENT


                                      I.    INTRODUCTION

1.            This program document proposes a single-tranche First Poverty Reduction Support
Credit (PRSC-1) to the Republic o f Moldova for SDR 6.8 million(US$10 millionequivalent) on
standard International Development Association (IDA) terms o f 40 years maturity including 10
years grace. The proposed operation i s an integral part o f the Bank's strategy to support the
implementation of Moldova's Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EGPRSP) and
EU-Moldova Action Plan. The move to supporting poverty reduction through programmatic
lending is consistent with Moldova's level o f institutional, economic and political development
and acknowledges the country's strong and sustained performance inrecent years. PRSC-1 i s the
first in a series o f three single tranche operations that would facilitate the implementation o f
cross cutting reforms aimed at improvingthe living conditions o f the Moldovanpopulation.

2.            The first EGPRSP Annual Evaluation Report, circulated to the BoardinApril 2006,
raised the concern that overall poverty reduction in Moldova has stalled in recent years despite
continued strong growth performance. Indeed, the Bank's recent Poverty Assessment update
shows that poverty in rural areas has actually increased. The Government i s aware that to
address these stagnant poverty trends the quality o f economic growth needs to be changed. To
accelerate economic growth and poverty reduction, the three pillars o f the PRSC will support the
Government's efforts to: i)improve the investment climate so as to stimulate a greater domestic
supply response; ii)increase the efficiency and management o f the public sector resources to
create fiscal space for increased public investment spending; and, iii)strengthen social protection
systems to better protect the poor and vulnerable groups.

3.            Bilateral and multilateral donor assistance will continue to play an important role in
supporting the implementation o f the EGPRSP and EU-Action Plan, given that the country's
own resources fall short o f the levels required for achieving the objectives spelled out in the
strategy. The PRSC i s an important step to further the principles o f harmonization, providing a
framework for policy dialogue and decisions linked to progress in the implementations o f the
critical areas o f the EGPRSP. Insupport o f the EGPRSP, the PRSC has created the momentum
for a significant group o f donors to align their budgetary support under a common framework.
The PRSC will be supported by co-financing from other multilateral and bilateral donors,
includingthe United Kingdom (DFID), Sweden (SIDA) and the Dutch Government with close
coordination with the EUinthe context o f the new EuropeanNeighborhoodPolicy initiative.

                                         A.          RECENT        ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

4.                  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Growth, Inflation and Exchange Rate. Since
2000, Moldova's strong growth performance has reversed a decade o f economic decline and
rising poverty. The economy has grown by nearly 40 percent since 2000 with average real
growth o f around 7 percent per annum. In 2005, the economy grew at 7.1 percent but
developments in the first part o f 2006 point to some weakening (see next section). The major
source o f growth inMoldova has been domestic household consumption and construction fueled
by massive inflows o f workers' remittances - officially recorded at nearly 30 percent o f GDP in
2005. While growing slowly as a share o f GDP, private domestic investment has averaged only
17 percent o f GDP since the beginning o f recovery. Similarly, public domestic investment has
remained very low (less than 2 percent o f GDP) with the result that public infrastructure,
particularly roads, has continued to deteriorate with negative implications for growth. Duringthe
recent recovery, the increase indomestic output has relied more on increased capacity utilization
rather than significant additions to capacity. While remittance inflows are likely to continue to
support strong consumption growth in the short run, over the medium-term the EGPRSP notes
that Moldova will need to generate a stronger and more robust domestic supply response.
Indeed, as the opportunities reaped from labor shedding and increased capacity utilization are
exhausted, future gains in productivity will require increasing domestic investment and
innovation.

5.                  Agriculture i s the largest real sector o f the economy, accounting for nearly 20
percent o f GDP (30 percent if agroprocessing i s included), generating the majority o f Moldova's
exports (59 percent), and employing over 40 percent o f the labor force. Like other sectors o f the
economy, agriculture suffered during the transition, with agricultural value added shrinking by
more than 50 percent. Moldova carried out its farm restructuring later than most other transition
economies, which prolonged the contraction o f the sector. But with the launch o f the National
Land Program in 1997-1998, there was a marked acceleration in the creation o f new peasant


                                                                        2

farms and a coincident increase in agricultural production by the individual sector.          These
reforms resulted in a gradual increase insector output beginning in 2000. However, beginning in
2001, farm restructuring stalled and the sector was frozen in a semi-reformed state with
approximately half o f agricultural land used by 300,000 individual family farms, and the other
half o f the land still managed by 300-400 new corporate forms that are the heirs to the former
collectives. The sector i s also characterized by underdevelopedand imperfect markets and policy
uncertainty, which cause low agricultural producer prices and lack o f access to inputs. Thus, the
sector has not been able to fully benefit from the land reform and farm restructuring efforts that
have taken place. As a result, the agriculture sector has continued to underperform the industrial
and services sectors in both absolute and relative terms. To generate sustained growth in the
sector, the Government recognizes the need to build upon its earlier reform efforts by creating
the incentives for continued farm restructuring, market-oriented production by individual family
farms, and increased efficiency inthe sector.

6.            In recent years, monetary policy has strived to achieve a number o f objectives,
including maintaining a competitive exchange rate, keeping inflation low and accumulating a
precautionary level o f international reserves. The large inflow o f remittances has contributed to
appreciation pressure on the real and nominal exchange rate underscoring the need for more
rapid improvement indomestic productivity. The National Bank o f Moldova (NBM)has actively
intervened in the foreign exchange market and has been rapidly accumulating foreign exchange
reserves. To rein in the monetary impact o f these interventions - and the inflationary pressures -
the NBM sharply increased its sterilization efforts in 2005 and significantly slowed reserve
money growth. Thus, despite the pick-up in energy prices in mid-2005, inflation dropped to 10
percent (y-0-y) at the end o f 2005, after peaking at over 14 percent in April 2005.           The
macroeconomic framework supported by the IMF PRGF program envisages a gradual decline in
inflation over the program's three year horizon.

7.            Fiscal Policy. The Government has maintained a prudent fiscal stance, with the
overall cash balance o f the general government averaging only 0.2 percent o f GDP since 2001,
with a budget surplus o f 1.7 percent o f GDP recorded in 2005. Recovery-induced buoyancy in
fiscal revenues has given Moldova the fiscal space to increase public expenditures. Since 2001,
both expenditures and revenues have increased faster than GDP. There is a need to maintain
fiscal discipline and for recognizing that the share o f tax revenues and expenditures to GDP in
Moldova already greatly exceed international norms for countries o f similar income levels. To
avoid crowding out private sector activity, the fiscal space needed to implement the EGPRSP,
particularly increasing public investment in infrastructure, will require inter- and intra-sectoral
reallocation o f public expenditures and an increase in the efficiency o f public spending rather
than increasingthe relative size o f government.

8.            The bulk o f Moldova's fiscal revenues come from the taxation o f consumption -
primarily the value added tax (VAT). The VAT (with a rate o f 20 percent) now supplies nearly
50 percent o f total consolidated budget revenues with over 87 percent o f that coming from the
VAT collected on imports.       Corporate and personal income taxes, on the other hand, each only
contribute about 10 percent o f fiscal revenues.    To broaden the tax base and increase revenues
coming from direct taxation, the Government has been reducing tax rates.            Since 2001, the
corporate tax rate has been reduced from 28 percent to 20 percent in 2004. Similarly, personal
' See MoldovaAgriculturalPolicv Note Vol. I-Land, ReportNo. 36366-MD, World Bank, June 1,2006.

                                                  3

income taxes have also been reduced, with the highest marginal rate declining from 32 percent to
25 percent. The positive performance o f corporate and personal income tax revenues duringthe
recovery has encouraged the Government to undertake further cuts in these taxes rates. Both the
corporate tax rate and the highest marginal personal income tax rate are scheduled to drop to 15
percent inthe next few years.

9.            On the expenditure side, the Government has focused spending increases on those
programs that were cut dramatically at the end o f the 1990s and earlier. Since 2000, spending on
health, education and social protection, which comprise nearly two-thirds o f total government
expenditures, has increased by nearly 6 percentage points o f GDP. Public expenditures on
capital and operation and maintenance o f basic infrastructure, however, have remained very
small and have declined as a share o f GDP since 2000, with negative implications for public
infrastructure, particularly the road network.         The EGPRSP recognizes the importance o f
increasing public investment and improving public investment management. As noted below,
planned increases in public sector wages will need to be tempered to make room for additional
domestic capital expenditures. Foreign grant and concessional financing will play a significant
role incovering the cost o f increased public investment.

10.           External Sector. As a small open economy, closer integration into the world
economy and a rapid growth in exports must serve as an engine o f growth.                 While strong
economic performance in Moldova's main trading partners has encouraged a rapid increase in
exports (averaging 19 percent over 2001-2005), the remittance-fueledincrease inconsumption as
well as higher energy prices have pushed up import growth even faster (averaging 23 percent
over the same period). As a result, the trade deficit has continued to worsen, exceeding 40
percent o f GDP in 2005. With large inflows o f workers' remittances (31 percent o f GDP in
2005), the current account deficit has been more modest (averaging slightly over 4 percent o f
GDP since 2000). The overall balance o f payments has been in surplus allowing for increases in
internationalreserves.

11.           Nearly 60 percent o f Moldova's exports are in the form o f agricultural products
(including from the ago-processing industry) and predominately from the wine and beverage
sectors. Though the direction o f trade has been slowly redirected towards the EU, this
transformation has been much slower than in other transition countries. As a result, the majority
o f exports are still bound for CIS members and Russia inparticular. With pressures on the real
exchange rate to appreciate, the increased international competitiveness needed to close the trade
gap will require an increase in domestic productivity.            This will require significantly more
domestic private and public investment, as well as foreign direct investment, than i s currently
undertaken.

12.            Since Moldova imports nearly all o f its energy needs, recent increases in energy
prices have had a severe impact on Moldova.           Fuel oil import prices rose by an estimated 44
percent in 2005. For the 2004-2005 period, Moldova paid $8O/thousand cubic meters (mcm) for
natural gas imports from Russia. Early in 2006, however, the price o f natural gas was increased
to $1lO/mcm and further increases (possibly to $160/mcm) innatural gas prices can be expected
inthe near future. The direct impact o f this increase has been to widen the underlyingtrade and
fiscal deficits. It has directly raised the cost o f electricity, natural gas and oil products procured
bythe Government at all levels (adding 0.5 percent o f GDP to government expenditures).



                                                    4

13.           Since the Government has largely passed these higher energy prices on to final
consumers, there have beenrisingpressures for additional subsidies and transfers. Currently, the
biggest government transfer program related to energy i s the nominal compensation scheme
introduced in 2000 to assist more vulnerable categories o f the population to pay for heating and
electricity. In 2005, there were nearly 260 thousand recipients o f this energy subsidy with
expenditures amounting to 385 million lei or 3 percent o f the general government expenditures.
This compensation ranges from 25 to 50 percent o f the cost o f the service. While this energy
subsidy program transformed the former system o f privileges into a relatively more targeted
program, the current program i s still not very efficient intargeting the poor. The criteria used to
define the vulnerable groups are not well defined - based on a categorical target system - and
more than one third o f the budget i s misallocated to the non-poor. (The distributional impacts o f
higher energy prices are detailedinthe poverty andsocial impact analysis o f SectionVI).
                B.       MACROECONOMIC ANDDEBTSUSTAINABILITY
                                             OUTLOOK

14.           The macroeconomic framework currently inplace i s satisfactory. InMay 2006, the
Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a new three-year
arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for an amount equivalent
to Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 80.08 million (about US$ll8.2 million). The IMF supported
program is designed to support growth and poverty reduction by maintaining macroeconomic
stability, particularly in the face o f strong inflows o f remittances and sharply higher prices for
imported energy. It also strives to improve the performance o f the financial sector, building
upon the lessons o f last year's Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). Key structural
measures supported by the PRGF include modernization o f the tax administration, improving
corporate governance and transparency for state-owned enterprises (as well as reinvigorating the
privatization process) and trade liberalization. The macroeconomic framework which underpins
the authorities' program is aiming for further gradual disinflation in the coming years. Further,
the fiscal program strikes the appropriate balance between the objectives o f supporting
disinflation and meetingthe country's extensive developmental needs.

15.           The export o f labor and resulting inflow o f workers' remittances have come to
dominate the economic and social landscape o f Moldova. Some 25 percent o f Moldova's
economically active population is now working abroad. Workers' remittances, equivalent to 31
percent o f GDP, have increased disposable income and fueled a rapid growth in final
consumption expenditures - the primary driver o f the current economic recovery. In addition,
migration and the inflow o f remittances have also contributed to an increase in the equilibrium
wage as well as the reservation wage o f workers.          While the relatively abundant inflow o f
workers' remittances is likely to continue over the foreseeable future, it i s unreasonable to expect
that these flows will continue to grow at the same rapid rate. Further, since the beginningo f the
economic recovery, increases in unit labor costs in Moldova have outstripped growth in labor
productivity.    Without increases in investment and innovation, it will become increasingly
difficult to sustain past growth in labor productivity since the opportunities provided by labor
shedding and factor reallocation inthe economy are gradually being exhausted.

16.           But a number of external shocks risk dampening economic growth inMoldova. In
late March, Russia's consumer protection agency announced a ban on imports o f wine from
Moldova. As wine represents 30 percent o f Moldovan exports, o f which about 80 percent (10
percent o f GDP) traditionally go to Russia, the impact o f this ban - even if resolved relatively

quickly  -  will have medium-term effects on the macroeconomic outlook.                                   Given its complete
dependence on imported energy, the recent large increases in energy prices will put further
pressure on the economy. Fueloil import prices increased by over 40 percent in2005 and natural
gas prices were increased by 38 percent in early 2006 with further increases in natural gas prices
expected (to $160/mcm).

 17.          As shown inTable 1, these external shocks are expected to contribute to slower real
GDP growth in2006 (4 percent) as well as
a weaker medium-term outlook (with real                        Table 2. Moldova: Fiscal FinancingGap200448

18.           To support lower inflation, address the widening trade deficit and avoid crowding
out private sector investment, fiscal policy will remain relatively tight and supportive o f
monetary policy over 2006-2008. As shown in Table 2, the IMF PRGF program targets an
underlying general government budget deficit o f no more than 0.5 percent o f GDP over the
program period. Bilateral and multilateral donors are expected to support the budget's efforts to
meet the EGPRSP spending objectives with external grants and concessional financing.                                               The

All o f these values fall below the debt distress thresholds for countries with Moldova's Country
Performance Indicator Assessment (CPLA) overall score.2

22.              Consistent with the authorities' medium-term fiscal program, supported by the
IMF's PRGF, a further decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected, with the NPV of public
sector debt-to-GDP ratio declining to 10 percent by 2025. The alternative scenarios and stress
tests also show declining ratios over time (with the exception o f the most extreme test which
posits a permanently lower GDP growth and, being a static exercise, assumes that public
spending would not adjust to this lower growth).

23.             Debt sustainability analysis suggests that Moldova does not face a structural debt
sustainability problem. The M a y 2006 agreement with Paris Club creditors to restructure its
external debt has alleviatedpressing short-term liquidity difficulties (which had been resulting in
the accumulation o f external arrears) and frees up resources for other development needs. The
Paris Club agreement consolidates roughly USSl50 million due on debts contracted before
December 31, 2000. This amount consists o f arrears (US$68 million through end-April 2006) as
well as repayments falling due from M a y 2006-December 2008 (US$81.8 million).                            The
rescheduling i s structured on the so-called "Houston Terms". This agreement i s expected to
reduce debt service due to Paris Club creditors during the program period from US$149.9 to
US$60.8 million (mainly interest on the rescheduled amounts and payment on the arrears).
Along with the funding from the proposed PRSC and other expected donor assistance, this
rescheduling will reduce Moldova's financing gap over the program period.

24.             A prolonged recession through the 1990s made Moldova the poorest country in
Europe. By 1999, over 70 percent o f Moldovans were poor and over 60 percent o f the population
was extremely poor.          Moldova's social indicators, a measure o f non-income dimensions o f
poverty, were also considered among the worst inthe region.

25.             The recent economic recovery has led to a massive movement out o f income
poverty. Between 1999 and 2003, over 37 percent o f the population moved out o f poverty in
Moldova, marking the largest absolute decline in poverty in Europe and Central Asia over this
period. The decline in absolute poverty was broad-based and poverty fell across all locations.
Inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, has been on a slight downward trend since the
late1990s. Starting in 2004, however, poverty reduction has stalled despite continued vigorous
economic growth. Indeed, during the first three quarters o f 2005, the seasonally adjusted poverty
rate actually increased, heightening concerns that rapid economic growth i s no longer reducing
poverty.

* According  to the Bank's classification,the critical debt distress thresholds are: NPViGDP =40 percent,
NPV/exports=l50 percent and debt service/exports=20percent.

sector accounts for the largest share o f
informal employment, where the poverty risk i s higher than inthe formal sector. The agricultural
character o f poverty in Moldova i s not surprising in an economic environment where the
agricultural sector has provided a significant source o f income for many households while at the
same time experiencing a prolonged contraction throughout most o f the transition period.                 The
continued underperformance o f the agri-food sector i s perhaps the most critical constraint to
faster economic growth and poverty reduction.

27.            While the initial turnaround o f agricultural output and decline in rural poverty was
associated with the land privatization and farm restructuring program that began in the late
199Os, the recent uptick in rural poverty coincided with stalled farm restructuring characterized
by a slight reversal o f the amount o f land usedby individual farms in2002 and 2003. The delay
inrestructuring farms and getting land into the hands of individualfarmers is having an adverse
affect on agricultural output and farmer incomes. Calculation o f total factor productivity (TFP)
by farm type has shown that small, individual farms inMoldova are significantly more efficient
than large, corporate farms. This is consistent with evidence from around the world, where
agriculture in developed market economies is generally agriculture by individual family farms,
and where many studies have shown that agriculture i s not generally characterized by economies
o f scale. Infact, in Moldova today, individual farms produce over 70% o f agricultural output on
50% o f the land. By keeping 50% o f land tied up in inefficient corporate farms, the land
available to family farmers i s reduced, which in turn reduces their income-generating
opportunities and often restricts them to practicing subsistence agriculture. With few
opportunities, many smallholders have no alternative but to rent their land at low rates to
corporate farms, which usually pay in kind, and often do not pay at all. This further constrains
incomes o f smallholders.

28.            There are two reasons why rental prices paid by corporate farms are low, and the
same arguments apply to agricultural wages. First, due to their large size, corporate farms
specialize in field crops such as cereals and oilseeds that are typically low-margin, and these
margins are further reduced by government policies such as export restrictions and other market
distortions. Second, corporate farms are less efficient (lower TFP) and less profitable (according
to official figures, only 55% o f corporate farms were profitable in2004).

29.            Distortions and imperfections in agncultural output and input markets reduce the
scope for farm restructuring and rural poverty reduction. Analysis shows that agricultural
producers are receiving less for their outputs and paying more for their inputs relative to
international parity prices than they s h o ~ l dThe           . ~ effects on six major commodities are reflected
in Figure 2, which compares the prices received by Moldovan farmers to international prices,
after accounting for transportation, handling and other costs. The results show that, on average
for these six commodities, farmers received 29% less on their sales than they should have based
on world market prices over the period 2000 to 2004. Further, the situation has not been
improving over time, and for crops like wheat and tomatoes, it has worsened considerably. This
has a direct negative effect on rural poverty by squeezing the incomes o f farmers, and reduces
the ability o fpeasant farms to succeed as viable businesses.

30.            While peasant farmer incomes are squeezed by poor agricultural terms o f trade,
corporate farms are protected by favorable public expenditures and government policies. The
repeated writing off, rescheduling and accumulation o f debt without consequence has allowed
inefficient corporate farms to continue operating at a loss. At the same time, many government
support programs are targeted to large, corporate farms.6 This i s done by setting restrictions on
minimum farm size or ownership structure, or by targeting crops grown primarily by corporate
farms. The combined effect o f such policies is to reduce the incentive for restructuring o f the
large corporate farms, and limit the flow o f land and public support to peasant farmers.

31.            This PRSC is designed to spur growth and rural poverty reduction through
increased farm restructuring and enhanced competitiveness by improving policies in two key
areas: Improving the investment climate through the development o f agricultural output and
input markets (see Pillar 1.C below); Improving the efficiency and management o f public
resources for the agricultural sector (see Pillar 1I.C.1below).

32.           Despite Moldova's remarkable achievement            in reducing income poverty,
comparable progress has not been achieved along non-income dimensions o f poverty. There are
persistent or increasing disparities in access to education and health care. For example, while
enrollment rates have increased during the recovery period, they have been driven mostly by the
increased participation o f richer households. Out o f pocket expenses for public services, which
have been on the rise, have impacted the poor disproportionately.

   111. THE GOVERNMENT'SECONOMIC GROWTHAND POVERTY
                                 REDUCTIONPROGRAM

33.            The EGPRSP was presented to the Boards o f IDA and IMF inNovember 2004 and
was the first full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) prepared by the Moldovan
authorities. It was developed in broad-based consultations with stakeholders and civil society,
and benefited from a participatory process that was organized under the supervision of a
Participation Council comprised o f representatives o f all stakeholder groups. This process has
remainedinplace duringthe EGPRSP implementation period.

34.            The EGPRSP establishes three medium-term objectives: sustainable and inclusive
economic growth; reduction o f poverty and inequality and increased participation o f the poor in
economic development; and human resource development. To achieve these objectives, the
EGPRSP calls for a three-pillar strategy: (i)promotion o f sustainable and inclusive economic
growth; (ii)  improved human development; and (iii)strengthened social protection o f the most
vulnerable groups.

35.           Under the first pillar, the stated goals o f the EGPRSP are improvements in the
business environment and access to infrastructure, and maintenance o f prudent macroeconomic
management to promote sustainable growth. The EGPRSP attaches a highpriority to improving
the business environment and investment climate to reverse a decline in investment, and thus
foster quality economic growth. To ensure that growth is inclusive for the rural poor and the
marginalized populations, the EGPRSP focuses on furthering agricultural and rural development.
Recognizing that improving human capital is key to economic growth, the second pillar o f the
EGPRSP rests on human resource development, through education and health. The EGPRSP

pension and social assistance systems are at the center o f the social protection strategy - the third
focuses on measures to increase access to and improve the quality o f education. Reforms o f the

pillar o fthe EGPRSP. Reform o f the pension system will include the rationalization o f the social
insurance system to ensure its long-term financial sustainability and pension adequacy. The
social assistance system will be strengthened through improved targeting and efficiency to
ensure that benefits reach the most vulnerable poor. Inachieving these strategic objectives, the
EGPRSP i s conscious o f the constraint imposed by the insufficient functional and institutional
adaptation o f the public administration to the requirements set by the transition from a central
planned economy to a market economy.        Establishing a modem, efficient public administration
is, therefore, recognized in the EGPRSP as an important element in achieving the development
outcomes o f the Government's poverty reduction strategy.

36.           In April 2006, the Moldovan authorities prepared the first Annual Evaluation
Report (AER) highlightingprogress in implementingthe EGPRSP from late 2004 to early 2006.
In the Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) the staffs noted that the AER provided a candid
assessment o f the accomplishments and shortcomings of the past year, focusing on outcomes

                                                11

rather than inputs. The AER highlighted the continued poverty reduction, but also noted areas
where policy implementationhas been slower than originally envisaged. Staffs noted that reform
momentum has been enhanced by the European Union-Republic o f Moldova (EU-RM) Action
Plan, approved in February, 2005. Inthose areas o f endeavor where the two documents overlap,
the EGPRSP and the EU-RMAction Plan are mutually consistent, and reforms have accelerated.

37.           The report raised the appropriate concern that the decline in poverty among
households in rural areas   - where the majority o f the poor live - has stagnated. In this regard,
the quality o f growth poses a major concern for the macroeconomic and poverty outlook. The
AER recognized the need to implement sound policies and structural reforms aimed at
revitalizing the business climate and creating the conditions conducive for private sector
investment and productivity gains. Strengthening accountability and improving governance in
the public sector, goals o f the public administration reform effort, are also acknowledged as key
priorities inthe period ahead.

38.           The report noted that, while the allocation o f resources to cover EGPRSP priorities
in the social sectors has been reasonable, the increase in the level o f spending has not been
accompanied by sufficient progress in improving the efficiency o f this spending. Inthe area o f
social assistance, the AER noted that the system i s still fragmented and inadequatelytargeted. In
education, the growing availability o f resources has still been insufficient to maintain the quality
o f education and plans to optimize the school network are highlighted. The report notes that
while indicators on maternal and infant mortality are below targeted levels, increasing the
efficiency o f healthcare will be needed in order to maintain the benefit package o f universal
health insurance. The need to increase public investment in infrastructure i s clearly recognized,
but actual and planned budget allocations remain inadequate, raising doubts that the EGPRSP
priority actions in this area will be met. The JSAN recommended that the authorities ensure
better strategic linkages between the annual budgets, the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF) and the EGPRSP. Strengthening the efficiency o fpublic spendingwill also be needed if
the priorities specified inthat strategy are to be met.
               Iv.     BANKSUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT'S                     PROGRAM

                             A.      MOVING THECASHIGHCASE

39.           The 2004 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was presented to the Executive Board
against a backdrop o f a difficult policy environment. Both the IMF (PRGF) and the World Bank
Structural Adjustment Credit I11(SACIII) programs had recently gone o f f track with less than
one-third o f the committed funds under these programs being disbursed.                Further, the
Government's Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP), which was
adopted in mid-2004, contained policies and actions that reflected a radical departure from the
Government's 2001 Economic Revival Program. These circumstances raised considerable
concern about the government's commitment to the reform program articulated in the EGPRSP.
As a result, the CAS adopted a cautious approach with the Base Case lending scenario including
only investment operations targeted at the local and community level.

40.           CAS High Case Triggers. At the same time, under a High Case lending scenario,
the CAS left open the opportunity for a resumption o f policy based lending (i.e. a PRSC)
provided that Government ownership o f the reform program was demonstrated in a good


                                                  12

implementation track record. To this end, the CAS developed a series o f key reform benchmarks
that would provide the basis for evaluating reform progress incritical areas: the maintenance o f a
stable macroeconomic framework and fiscal discipline, public sector reform and governance,
improving the business environment, furthering pension reforms, and promoting liberal and
market-oriented agricultural sector policies.

41.              As indicated inTable 5, most o f the reform benchmarks established under the CAS
high case have been fully or substantially accomplished demonstrating a track record o f reform
by the Government.               In some areas, such improving the business environment (reducing
licensing and inspection costs and import clearance times),                             and maintaining a stable
macroeconomic framework (including external arrears clearance), the government has exceeded
the CAS high case triggers. In the area o f public sector reform, the Government has moved
beyond the limited reform trigger established for the CAS and launched an ambitious public
sector reform with donor support. Insummary, this track record includes:
          Meeting the benchmarks spelled out in the EGPRSP's annual implementation plan. As
          noted earlier, the Government's first Annual Evaluation Report highlighted progress in
          implementing the EGPRSP and provided a candid assessment o f the accomplishments
          and shortcomings o f the past two years o f reform.
     e    Maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework andflscal discipline. Economic growth
          has continued to be strong, inflation has been under control, the general government
          budget has been in surplus, and external debt ratios have declined rapidly. A new IMF

PRGF program was approved by the IMF's Executive Board o n M a y 5, 2006 with an
agreed macroeconomic framework for the next three years. Following the IMF program,
an agreement was reached with the Paris Club that resultedinthe rescheduling o f existing
external arrears.
Public Sector Reform and Governance. At the beginning o f 2005 the Government
embarked on a major public administration reform (PAR) effort aimed at streamlining the
public administration, improving the system and capacity for government decision
making, reforming the civil service on merit principles and improving the systems for
aligning government strategies and resources. This reform effort i s much more ambitious
and extensive than envisaged under the CAS. With donor support, the Government has
prepared a sound reform strategy and implementation planwhich it adopted inDecember
2005. A Bank administered multi-donor trust fund has been established to support this
reform effort. Efforts to improve public financial management are being supported by a
Bank investment operation. Increased competition for public procurement contracts i s
evidenced by a decline in single source procurement from 51 percent to 45 percent o f the
value o f contracts awarded (including utilities) and an increase in the use o f open
tendering from 28 to 40 percent o f the value o f contracts awarded.
Improving the Business Environment. Duringthe last few years Moldova has simplified
business registration and licensing procedures, while reducing the required number o f
licenses and documents for business registration. In2005, these reform efforts intensified
with the adoption o f the so-called "Guillotine" law which reviewed and streamlined
business regulations still further (as evidenced by the improvement in Moldova's 2005
BEEPS results).    As a result, licensing and inspection costs have declined as have the
number o f business inspections.         In the area o f trade facilitation, progress in
implementing the Trade and Transportation Facility for Southeast Europe (TTFSE)
project and the alignment o f custom's legislations and regulations to EU standards have
significantly reduced the time needed to clear the inland customs terminal. The adoption
and implementation o f the Asycuda clearance system will contribute to the acceleration
o f these improvements.
Improving Social Protection. Steady progress has been made in implementing the 1998
pension reform program. No new types o f pension privileges have been introduced and
the overall retirement age has beenraised from 60 to 62 for men and 55 to 57 for women.
The Government has also made a commendable effort towards the system which bases
actual pension payments on actual pension contributions with more than 75 percent o f the
5.8 million required records now entered into the contribution database system.
Agricultural Reforms. The 2001 Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) on Agriculture
lays out a number o f agreed policy principles. Overall, the Government has largely
adhered to the principles contained in this MoU. In particular, the Government has
resisted pressures to change the land code and i s working with the Bank (as part o f the
Rural Investment and Services Project (RISP) to develop a pilot land re-parceling
program.    Government policy towards agricultural markets has been largely market
oriented. Export restrictions that had been imposed in 2005 will be removed as part o f
the IMF PRGF program. The Government has refrained from imposing any policies
directed at managing agricultural production. While the Government has been developing
its extension and advisory services to provide support to independent farmers (under
RISP) additional efforts will be required to rationalize subsidy and support programs to
the needs o f post-privatization agriculture. Given current fiscal constraints, the existing
subsidy program consumes only a small fraction o f the government budget. The PRSC

                                         14

        will support the Government's efforts to restructure agriculture expenditures, increasing
        the share o f spending on agricultural services and investment, and reducing share o f
        product and input subsidies.

42.              EU-Moldova Action Plan. Inaddition to demonstrating progress in implementing
these key reform benchmarks, the Government's commitment to economic reforms has been
further reinforced by its stated EU aspirations which culminated in the adoption of an EU-
MoldovaAction Plan inMay 2005 (see Box 1). This plan aims to establish an increasingly close
relationship between the EU and Moldova and involves a significant degree o f economic
integration and deepening of political co-operation.                     Implementation o f the action plan will
significantly advance the approximation of Moldovan legislation, norms and standards to those
o f the EuropeanUnion. Consistent with the EGPRSP, from which it is largely drawn, the policy
framework contained inthis EU action plan has sustainable development as its objective. Inthe
2005 elections, the Government retained its majority in Parliament giving it some breathing
room to undertake major reforms before the commencement o fthe next political cycle.

                    B. COLLABORATION WITHTHE IMFAND OTHERDONORS

44.           IDA partnership with the IMF in Moldova's development strategy has been
excellent over the past few years.      The Bank and Fund Boards endorsed the EGPRSP in
November 2004 as well as the first annual progress report (May 2006). Bank and IMF staffs
have executedjoint work and have continued to carry out joint missions at least twice a year for
macroeconomic policy dialogue with the Government.                             The IMF policy dialogue with the
Government takes place in the context o f the ongoing Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF), covering the 2006-2008 period. The PRSC has been prepared in conjunction with the
PRGF to ensure the consistency o f the macroeconomic and structural policy reforms supported
by both programs. The IMF is taking the lead on macroeconomic issues while IDA takes the
lead on structural and social issues.    In a number of areas where the mandates of the two
institutions overlap, such as public finance, the work i s being closely coordinated to ensure that
consistent advice i s provided to the authorities.              The existence o f an IMF program i s an
important input for the determination o f the adequacy o f the macroeconomic policy framework.
(See Annex 3)

45.           Donor support plays an important role in supporting the implementation o f the
EGPRSP and PRSC programs.           Coordination between IDA, the United Kingdom (DFID),
Sweden (SIDA), and the Netherlands has been especially strong since all these donors have been
collaborating in the preparation o f a single policy framework to be included in the PRSC.
PRSC-1was catalytic in starting improved donor harmonization inMoldova. Duringpreparation
o f the PRSC, DFID, SIDA, and IDA carried out joint missions in consultation with the European


                                                    16

Union. This harmonization process was carried forward through a Development Partnership
Framework signed between the Government, IDA, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom
(DFID), Sweden (SIDA), the UN, IMF, and EU entitled "Co-ordination and Harmonization of
Government and Donor Practices for Aid Effectiveness in the Republic o f Moldova" signed in
Chisinau on May 29, 2006. This Partnership Framework commits the parties to joint reviews,
harmonization o f indicators, and prior actions and synchronization with Government budget
cycles with a view to reducing transaction costs o f assistanceto the Government.
     c.ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGSAND             RELATIONSHIPTO OTHER BANKOPERATIONS

46.          Analytical Work.The PRSC rests on a wide program o f analytic work carried out by
the Government, the Bank, and other donors that have helped inform the design o f the PRSC.
The recent Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) (2005) and Poverty Assessment (2004) and
Poverty Assessment Update (2006) provide in depth analysis and recommendation related to
growth and poverty reduction in support o f the implementation o f the EGPRSP. The studies
underlinethe need to change the quality of growth inMoldova, moving away from the current
consumption led, remittance fueled growth paradigm. They highlight the need to raise domestic
productivity, particularly inthe agricultural sector, by improving the investment climate so as to
encourage greater investment and innovation as the most direct means to accelerate growth and
reduce poverty in Moldova.      The CEM, Agricultural Policy Notes (2006), InvestmentClimate
Assessment (2004), the annual Cost o f Doing Business Surveys, and the Trade Diagnostic Study
(2004) provide a detailed analysis o f the business environment, providing recommendations to         a


reduce regulatory and administrative costs and improve trade facilitation as a means to
encourage an acceleration in economic growth and poverty reduction. The CEM, as well as the
Trade Diagnostic Study and Public Finance Review (2006), highlight the constraint to economic
growth imposed by the deteriorating infrastructure and highlight the need to increase the
currently low levels o fpublic investment.

47.          The Public Economic Management Review (2003) and the Public Finance Review
provide recommendations on improving the efficiency and management o f public sector
resources. These studies examine public expenditures in the social sectors - education, health,
social assistance, and pensions  - and highlight the need to improve the strategic allocation o f
public resources by increasing efficiency o f spending so as to free public resources to increase
public investment.   The studies also point to the need to establish a modem and efficient public
administration, necessary in order to achieve the country's longer-term development outcomes.
They provide recommendations on improving the MTEF process, public procurement practices,
as well as public investment management. The Education Strategy Note (2006), the Health
Policy Note (2007), Social Assistance Note (2007), and the Agriculture Policy Notes (2006)
provide recommendations on improved public sector resource use to achieve better outcomes in
these sectors.

48.          The Bank's fiduciary work, Country Procurement Assessment Report (2003), and
the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (2003), which has focused on the
Government's financial and procurement systems, has been complemented by a recent multi-
donor Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA) (2006). The latest
PEFA assessment has been produced during a period of significant overall reform o f public
financial management in Moldova. The MTEF i s being strengthened and expanded, leading to
improved budget preparation. The introduction o f a new FMIS i s planned which should offer


                                                17

significant improvements in the quality and timeliness o f financial information. A new
procurement law i s being developed, training and the development o f a strategy for public
financial internal control i s ongoing. These studies provide an integrated assessment o f public
financial management performance and the impact o f public financial management weaknesses,
as well as the recommendations for reform which have informed the preparation o f the PRSC.

49.           Bank Operations. The CAS Progress Report recognizes the PRSCs as the main
instrument o f the Bank for providing support to the implementation o f the EGPRSP. It also
states that complementarity o f efforts between programmatic support and investment lending i s
key to making efficient use o f Bank resources. The current portfolio includes support for
infrastructure (water and energy), private sector development, agriculture, community based
development, public financial management, education, health, HIV/AIDs,and environment.

50.           A number o f investmentprojects support institutional reforms and capacity building
to help the government realize its vision o f a private sector led economy. The recently approved
private sector Competitiveness Enhancement Project (2005) will assist Moldova in enhancing
competitiveness o f enterprises through improvements in the business environment and making
adequate standards, testing, and quality improvement services available to enterprises.      The
project will contribute to the overall government effort in the area o f improving business
environment and provide strategic input, including continuous support for developing regulatory
reform strategy, building institutional capacity for deregulation, and introducing Regulatory
Impact Assessment (RIA) in the legislative process o f Moldova.         The Trade and Transport
Facilitation in Southeast Europe Project (2003) seeks to reduce non-tariff costs to trade and
transport and reduce smuggling and corruption at border crossings.            The Second Rural
Investment and Services Project (2006) for Moldova provides long-term support to accelerate
agricultural recovery and growth so that Moldova's agricultural and rural sectors can play their
full role in providing the underpinnings for future income growth and poverty reduction. The
project provides information, knowledge, and know-how to newly established private farmers
and rural population, strengthens the emerging rural private sector, and expands the outreach o f
formal financial sector to rural areas via the development o f Savings and Credit Associations.
PRSC support i s aimed at leveraging these reform efforts and supporting complementary reform
efforts to improve the business environment.

51.           The Bank also supports a number o f projects aimed at improving the efficiency o f
public sector resource use. The Public Financial Management Project (2006) aims to achieve
effective and transparent management o f public finances by providing assistance to improve
budget formulation and execution, a new financial management information system, and better
internal control and audit capability. A Bank managed, multi-donor trust fund (2006) has been
established to assist the government in their public administration reform efforts.      The IDF
grant for the Development o f Public Procurement Infrastructure (2004) follows up on the CPAR
to assist the Government in the development o f its public procurement system.        The project
supports Capacity building, further development o f the procurement legislative framework, and
increased automation o f public procurement functions.

52.          Bank operations have also focused on improving resource use in specific sectors.
The Quality Education in Rural Areas Project (2006) supports the Government's education
program to enhance the quality o f teaching and learning in rural schools and improve the
efficiency inpublic spending for education, particularly inthe context o f projected demographic

                                                 18

trends. The PrimaryHealth and Social Assistance project (under development) would scale-up
the Bank's previous interventionsthrough competitive mechanisms established under the Health
Investment Fund Project (HIF) (2000)                        and promote the use o f improved clinical and
management skills also supported by the HIF. It would support the Government's efforts to
further improve service delivery with focus on ensuring equitable access, especially o f the rural
population, to quality health care and to buildthe clinical and management capacity o f the health
workforce to improve quality and efficiency, while taking measurable steps towards financial
sustainability o f the health care system. The Road Infrastructure Project (under development)
would assist the Government in better mobilizing domestic resources by reforming road
financing mechanisms and introducing competition in the execution o f road maintenance
contracts. The Public Expenditure Review PERprocess and analytic work, such as the C E M and
Trade Diagnostic Study, play an important role in providing advice on strategic priorities and
appropriate government processes for the expansion o f infrastructure.

53.              Finally, in the social sectors, Bank support i s provided in the context o f social
development programs in health, education, and social protection.                              The Social Protection
Management Project (1999) supports the Government's efforts to develop the capacity required
to implement the pension reform and to support the development o f an efficient and sustainable
social protection system. The Primary Health and Social Protection project (FY07) aims to assist
the government in scaling up efforts to improve the targeting efficiency o f social assistance
programs.

                  v.       THEPROPOSEDOPERATIONAND POLICYACTIONS

                                        A.        OVERALL      DESCRIPTION

54.             The objective o f the proposed PRSC is to support the Government's economic
growth and poverty reduction strategy. The proposed PRSC selectively supports the following
areas o f the EGPRSP and EU Action Plan where the sustainability o f the key reforms requires
consolidation, prioritization, cross-cutting support, and deepening to make real progress on the
growth and poverty reduction agenda:

    1. Improving the Investment Climate, through key policy actions to improve the investment
        climate and foster a more competitive enterprise and farming sector. With the impetus
        behind the current consumption led, remittance driven growth expected to wane,
        sustaining and accelerating future growth and poverty reduction in Moldova will depend
        on increases in domestic productivity. Achieving faster productivity growth, as well as


                                                           20

        employment generation, will depend on the extent to which firms and farms address
        current low levels o f investment and innovation. K e y to Moldova's efforts to accelerate
        economic growth and poverty reduction will be improving the performance o f the
        agriculture sector. Similarly, reducing the destabilizing economic impacts o f external
        price shocks will require improvements in energy efficiency.

   2. Improving the eficiency and management ofpublic resources, by helping the government
        build a meritocratic civil service, improve the strategic allocation o f public finances -
        with an enhanced focus on pro-growth investment spending on physical and human
        capital, and increasing competition inpublic procurement. Better governance and public
        institutions are central to growth and poverty reduction. The insufficient functional and
        institutional adaptation o f the public administration to the requirements set by the
        transition from a centrally planned to a market economy i s a key constraint to the
        efficient management o f public resources. Establishing a modem and efficient public
        administration i s necessary in order to achieve the country's longer-term development
        outcomes. Increasedpublic investment spending, particularly inpublic infrastructure, will
        be needed in order to support Moldova's private-sector led growth. This will require
        enhancing the strategic allocation o f public resources by improving the MTEF process,
        public procurement practices, and including better public investment management.
        Reforms in a number o f key sectoral areas can also improve the efficiency o f public
        resource use, yielding increased fiscal space for more public investment spending without
        crowding out the private sector.

   3 .  Strengthening Pension and Social Assistance Systems by supporting further reforms to
        pension and social assistance systems, including better targeting o f vulnerable groups by
        these programs. The recent slowdown in poverty reduction highlights the need to
        improve the quality o f growth inMoldova and strengthen existing social safety nets. The
        PRSC would support the Government's reform efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and
        future fiscal viability o f the pay-as-you-go pension program by supporting efforts to
        complete the 1999 pension reform, including efforts to unify the pension system for all
        types o f pensioners.   Improving targeting efficiency o f social assistance programs and
        gaining efficiency in program administration will be a necessary element o f Moldova's
        poverty reduction efforts.

PillarI:Improvingthe Investment Climate

55.             Inanalyzing the policy impediments to growth, the EGPRSP - and the Bank's own
analytical work - identifies the following factors as major constraints to private sector
development in Moldova: unstable legal and regulatory framework; excessive bureaucracy
reflected in the large number o f permits, licenses, and authorizations; and, excessive
interventions by control bodies. The recent 2005 BEEPS survey, for example, shows that
"uncertainty about regulatory policies" and "business licensing and permits" are ranked among
the biggest perceived problems to private sector activity. Given the importance o f the agricultural
sector to the overall economy and the preponderance o f the poor that live in rural areas,


                                                      22

improving the performance o f the underperforming agricultural sector will be o f particular
importance in accelerating growth and poverty reduction in Moldova. This pillar o f the PRSC
seeks to help Moldova confront the challenges to economic growth identified in the EGPRSP
and address some o f the critical bindingconstraints to growth and poverty reduction.
A.       Reducing Regulatory and Administrative Costs of BusinessRegulations

56.              During the last few years Moldova has simplified business registration and
licensing procedures and reduced the required number o f licenses and documents for business
registration. These efforts have contributed to a decline in the perception o f corruption in the
country, as measured by the decline inthe BEEPSresults on bribes paid as a percent o f sales and
the percent o f firms saying unofficial payments are frequent.                        In 2004, the Government
intensified its efforts to improve the business environment by adopting the "Concept o f
Regulatory Reform". This strategy established the framework and priorities for implementing
regulatory reform, including curbing business inspections, simplifying business licenses and tax
administration, and limiting mandatory reporting for statistical purposes. This effort led to
adoption o f a more radical law - the so called "Guillotine"                         law - which mandated a
comprehensive review o f business executive regulations and eliminated those regulations that
were no longer needed or did not have legal basis. Inparallel, the Government undertook steps
to improve quality o f the law making by7 developing a National Regulatory Reform Strategy that
targets reform o f the regulatory system.

57.              The Government recognizes that, despite these reform efforts, Moldova still has one
o f the highest regulatory compliance costs in the region.              The EGPRSP stresses the importance
o f (i)further streamlining o f business registration, and post-registration procedures o f issuing
permits, licenses and similar documents; (ii)           continuing o f the process o f reducing the number o f
state controls and inspections; and (iii)increasing the efficiency o f paid regulatory services
offered by public authorities, by setting fees for these services at cost recovering levels or
providing services for free whenever there are no additional costs.                      The key elements o f the
Government strategy will be reflected in a framework law on principles o f state regulation o f
economic activity, currently under preparation. The strategy will focus on reducing the cost o f
doing business, streamlining and simplifying regulations affecting opening and operation o f
business in Moldova, and introducing mechanisms to improve systematically the quality o f new
and existing regulations. Ultimately, the strategy will provide an explicit framework to accelerate
on-going reforms o f laws and regulations contemplated inthe current government program.

58.              The PRSC program will support the government efforts to further reduce regulatory
compliance costs. The Government has already made remarkable progress in achieving reform
benchmarks supported under the PRSCl. The results o f the Guillotine L a w implementation were
reflected in the recently adopted Government Decree N o 1030 on "Establishment o f a Registry
o f Official Acts Regulating Business Activity".                In parallel, the Government is pursuing a

7 InDoing Business 2007, Moldova's overall global standing onthe ease o fdoingbusiness has declined
substantially this year, slipping from 88th to 103rd. Although the decline is relative, reflecting the fast pace o f
reforms inother economies and the expanded coverage o f the report, the deterioration is also due to remaining
inefficiencies inMoldova's business environment, particularly inthe field o f construction licenses and permits. The
report also makes note o f Moldova's recent progress with implementation o f regulatory reform, which due to the
timing o f the report, have not been fully reflectedinthe Doing Business rankings. Nevertheless, it i s clear that
further reforms are needed to make Moldova's economy more competitive and more attractive for local and foreign
investors.

                                                          23

systemic approach to the regulatory reform implementation and improvement o f quality o f new
legislation by adopting a comprehensive medium-term regulatory reform strategy and enacting a
framework "Law on Basic Principles and Mechanisms o f State Regulation o f Business Activity",
which has been submitted to the Parliament.

59.            For PRSC2 and PRSC3, the Government will continue to implement the regulatory
reform strategy. It will complete the review o f existing laws regulating business activities and
undertake to further amend its business regulations in accordance with the Government Decree
on the results of regulatory review. It will improve the quality o f regulation o f business activity
by adopting the Law on Basic Principles and Mechanisms o f State Regulation o f Business
Activities and implementing an Action Plan that includes the introduction and use o f Regulatory
Impact Assessment (RIA) to the legislative process.

60.            At the end o f the PRSC program, based on the implementation o f the regulatory
reform strategy, it i s expected that there will be a significant reduction in regulatory compliance
costs, as measured by the Cost o f Doing Business Surveys (carried out under the auspices o f the
Competitiveness Enhancement Project) and confirmed by Moldova's indices in the Doing
Business reports.    Specifically, it expected that the average level o f licensing and authorization
costs per firm will fall from its current level o f 52 percent o f GDP per capita in 2004 to a level o f
around 30 percent GDP per capita.          Further, the Government will maintain a frequency o f
inspections at an average o f 8 inspections per year - down from its current level o f 12
inspections per year - with the average cost o f inspections per firm at or below 30 percent GDP
per capita.
B.      Improving TradeFacilitation

61.            The Moldova Customs Service (MCS) has improved significantly over the past
two-three years, aligning legislation and regulations to EU standards, as well as automating the
Customs declaration processing in the course o f implementing ASYCUDA-World.                      Data
collected on custom clearance times indicates a significant reduction inprocessingtimes relative
to last year. Progress in implementing the TTFSE project holds the promise that recent
improvements inthe Customs Service will be accelerated.

62.            However, inefficient and costly border procedures still exact a significant cost on
businesses that have to use them as well as the authorities that have to administer them. These
impediments lead to poor export competitiveness, make the country less attractive to foreign
investment, and reduce the ability o f domestic f i r m s to participate in global production networks.
Many o f the control mechanisms imposed by Customs and other border related agencies are
designed to control fraud and increase revenue collection on existingtransactions. The M C S still
collects about 70 percent o f total State Budget revenue, essentially through customs duties, VAT
on imports, and excise taxes. Given its importance in mobilizing fiscal revenues, Customs has
been under constant pressure to demonstrate its capacity to continue boosting its revenue
collections. As a result, the strategy followed by Customs has put a significant emphasis on
documentary requirements and checks, and introduced tough measures to address, in the short-
term, corruption. Introduction o f risk management and selectivity in the declaration process, and
o f targeting in the physical inspection o f goods has been regarded, until recently, as "loosening"
the control with the risk o f diminishingthe revenue collection and making room for smuggling.




                                                   24

63.             In addition to the emphasis on revenue collection, there are currently up to nine
agencies present at border crossing points. While one-third o f the border entry processing time i s
rightly attributed to the Customs Service, another one-third i s taken by the other agencies that are
present at the border (often just to collect fees). In the surveys carried out under the TTFSE
project, it i s estimated that about half o f the remaining time spent by trucks at border crossings
reflects the poor organization o f traffic flows resulting from the high number o f agencies present
at the border. Further, the sporadic unavailability o f staff o f these agencies contributes to
unjustified delays o f vehicles and passengers. Consolidation o f these efforts would contribute to
greater efficiency and improved trade facilitation.

64.             A new organizational structure o f MCS was approved inJune 2005, which includes
a dedicated risk analysis unit and a post release audit unit. The current implementation o f a risk
management system was augmented by the introduction o f post release audit, both supported by
the TTFSE project. This i s expected to lead to simplified and rationalized procedures while
increasing compliance by the business community.              Enforcement o f the newly approved
regulations on Customs Brokers, transit procedures, and Customs regimes will provide for
further simplification and transparency, but also leads to a serious restructuring o f the Customs
brokers' profession. Implementation o f the above reforms i s meant to reduce clearance and
border crossing processes by Customs, thereby reducing the transaction costs o f trade.

65.             Under PRSCI, introduction o f risk management and selectivity, using the on-going
ASYCUDA-World clearance system, has resulted in further reductions in import clearance
times.    For PRSCZ and PRSC3, a system o f Customs border and clearance performance
indicators and reporting, to be maintained after the TTFSE project closing,8 will be agreed upon,
and the number o f control agencies at the border will be reduced in line with EU practice.
Customs will collect fees on behalfo f other agencies.

66.             The implementation o f the reform program i s expected to reduce the average
monthly import clearance time at the main terminal o f Chisinau and the average monthly border
crossing entrytime to 30 minutes. Physical inspections by MCS, currently near 100percent, will
not exceed 30 percent o f total declarations on a monthly basis.
C.      DevelopingAgricultural Markets

67.             As illustrated above, Moldovan farmers receive less for their outputs and pay more
for their inputs relative to international parity prices than they should. This squeezes farmer
incomes, reduces the scope for farm restructuring, and decreases returns to factors such as land
and labor. The causes for this are various policy distortions and market imperfections that vary
by sub-sector. For commodities like cereals and oilseeds, a government requirement that forces
all exports to pass through the Universal Commodities Exchange (UCE), which i s dominated by
a small number o f multinational agribusinesses, restricts exports and creates a wedge between
international and farmgate prices. Domestic wheat prices are also reduced by state market
interventions aimed at stabilizing prices for urban consumers, such as profit margin caps on
bread and the management o f the state grain reserves. For higher-value agricultural products like
fruits, vegetables, livestock products, and wine (which i s the largest export), a major market
constraint i s the inability to meet and certify international quality standards. Improving standards

                                                   25

will be key to accessing higher-value markets such as EU countries and increasingly even
domestic supermarkets.

68.           On the input side, much o f the technology in modem agriculture i s encapsulated in
advanced seed and seedling varieties. In the case o f Moldova, farmers are being denied this
technology through restrictions on imports. Government protects domestic seed producers and
research institutes by controlling the importation o f new varieties through a complicated
licensing mechanism, including lengthy testing requirements. The reliance on domestic seed
monopolies increases costs and reduces farm productivity. Another major constraint i s the lack
o f access to credit. This i s being addressed in part through the new World Bank financed Rural
Investment and Services Project I1 (RISP 11). However, the long-term viability o f the Savings
and Credit Associations (SCAs) being supported under the project depends on strengthening the
legal and oversight environment, which i s beyond the scope o f the project.

69.           To accelerate and sustain growth in the sector, it i s necessary to complement farm
restructuring with measures to improve the functioning o f agricultural input and output markets.
Improving market opportunities will be key to increasingproducer prices, farm and farm worker
incomes, and to spurring the investment and innovation needed to keep Moldovan products
competitive as they access the EUand global market places.

70.           The EGPRSP affirms the importance o f these issues and includes objectives to
promote sustainable growth by continuing reforms in the sector, and building a strong
commercial and institutional framework based on market economy principles. The EGPRSP
recognizes that excessive regulation and inconsistent policies and their implementation have
created a particularly poor business environment in the agricultural sector. It therefore aims to
stimulate private initiative through market mechanisms and liberal agricultural policies. These
policies are outlined in the EGPRSP and the Memorandum o f Understanding on Agriculture
(MOU) signed with the World Bank in2001.

71.           Consistent with the EGPRSP and MOU, Government has largely adhered to market
principles by maintaining the Land Code, amending the Law on Production Cooperatives, and
generally refraining from setting or influencing prices (with some exceptions). Government has
also supported post-privatization agricultural enterprises through RISP project activities like
provision o f extension and advisory services, and the formation o f SCAs. However, the
commitment to market principles should be deepened in several areas.

72.           Under PRSC1, Government will totally liberalize agricultural exports by making
use o f the U C E purely voluntary for all commodities. This i s a reform that will affect
commodities that represent over one third o f the value o f total agricultural production, and it i s
something that can be done at virtually no cost (simply by issuing a decree). To better inform
agricultural producers on international market opportunities and trends in commodity prices,
Government will begin disseminating information on regional (Ukraine and Romania) prices for
cereals and oilseeds in the local media, as a precursor to the development o f its own market
information system. The Government has also agreed to undertake a study on improving its
policies towards grain price stabilization, including the use o f a profit margin ceiling on bread
and the management o f state grain reserves, to see ifpolicies with less distortionary implications
can be implemented.



                                                 26

73*           For PRSC2, Government will conduct a review o f the impact o f its export market
liberalization efforts, with an emphasis on cereals and oilseeds. Ifthe review finds that producer
prices continue to be depressed relative to international parity prices, PRSC2 will require
Government to implement additional measures needed to ensure that farmers receive a fair price
relative to international price parity, including transparent mandatory minimum oilseeds
producer price formula benchmarked to international prices (to address potential monopsony
issues in the market). Government will also undertake and begin implementation o f
recommendations o f its study on improving grain price stabilization. In addition, Government
will begin implementation o f an Action Plan that will, among other things, cover the
liberalization o f the import regime for seeds and seedlings, improvements in the agricultural
product standardization and certification system, and the development o f a market information
system to include the collection and dissemination o f information on domestic cereal and oilseed
prices. To enhance the sustainability o f the SCAs supported under RISP and RISP 11, a new law
based on international best practice will be passed to provide for a multi-level o f licensing with
correspondingreporting and supervisory requirements and with proper enforcement tools.

74.           For PRSC3, the Government will continue implementation o f the Action Plan,
including the scaling up o f the market information system to cover all basic commodities
accounting for at least 5 percent of value o f agriculture production. Government will also
complete the implementationo f the recommendationso f the grain price stabilization study.

75.           At the end o fthe PRSC program, it is expected that the gap betweenprices received
by farmers and international parity prices (measured by nominal protection coefficients) for
cereal and oilseed crops will be reducedby 25 percent   - implyingan increase inproducer prices,
and hence income, receivedby domestic farmers. Price information on all basic commodities, in
both domestic and international markets, will be reported at least weekly-and     where possible,
daily-in  the local media. The liberalization o f the seeds and seedlings market will result ina 25
percent increase in the new varieties registered, with the maximum time to evaluate and test
seeds and seedlings reduced to one and four years respectively.
D.      Reducing Energy Vulnerability

76.           The recent increase in energy prices exposed Moldova's high vulnerability to
external energy price shock. Due to the near total dependence on imports in meeting its primary
energy needs and a relatively high energy intensity of its economy (in terms o f the energy
consumption per unit o f GDP), Moldova faces significant downside risks to its economic outlook
as the energy prices, and particularly the price of natural gas, continue to increase. Higher oil
prices in 2005 and 2006, and the steep increase of the price o f natural gas from $80 to $110 per
thousand cubic meters (mcm) in January 2006, are expected to increase the cost o f energy
imports from $456 million in 2005 to about $600 million in 2006. While the cost o f electricity
imports in 2006 i s expected to remain at the 2005 level (about $62 million), this cost is also
likely to increase as the price o f natural gas supplied by Gazprom (Russia) to Moldova and
Ukraine continues to approach the European parity price which is currently in the order o f
$23O/mcm.

77.           Energy sector reforms, which started with the establishment o f an independent
energy regulatory agency (ANRE) in 1997 and culminated inprivatization o f about 70 percent o f
the electricity distribution market in 2000, prepared Moldova to deal with the energy price shock


                                                 27

in the gas and electricity sectors through necessary tariff adjustments and maintenance o f
financial discipline. ANRE raised domestic gas tariffs by 37 percent in February 2006, passing
the full cost increase o f imported natural gas to the final consumers. This, however, is less likely
to happen in the district heating sector (which i s dominated by Termocom - the state-owned
company supplyingheat inChisinau) because heating tariffs are regulated by municipal councils.
The Government recognizes that the mispricing o f heat supply is the main source o f quasi-fiscal
activities in the energy sector (estimated at about $15 million inTermocom) and that heat tariffs
need to be adjusted to the cost recovery level in order to return Termocom to financial viability
(and enable the much needed capital investments in the sector). At the same time, the
Government also recognizes that the rising energy prices require improvements in the social
safety net, particularly its better targeting in order to efficiently protect poor households which
may require energy subsidies o f about 1.7 percent o f GDP in2007.

78.            The Government recognizes that Moldova i s highly vulnerable to energy price
increases, and that upward price pressures are likely to be a fact o f life in the coming years. In
developing its policy response, the Government also recognizes that: (a) gas imports are likely to
continue to play a pivotal role in the energy balance o f Moldova in the long-term; and (b)
Moldova has in its hands the task o f reducing its energy vulnerability by improving energy
efficiency, reducing energy waste, and developing its own energy potentials - all o f which
require significant investments. Therefore, under the PRSCZ, the Government will develop and
start implementing a comprehensive energy efficiency strategy including measures to (i)
gradually adjust energy tariffs (for gas, electricity and heat) to full cost recovery level; (ii)
maintain the highcash collections rates for natural gas and electricity; (iii) Termocom and
                                                                               return
Combined Heat and Power plants to financial viability; (iv) develop incentives and other
measures to promote and facilitate investments in energy efficiency, energy savings, and
alternative (renewable) energy resources; (v) improve targeting and ensure adequate funding for
the safety net protecting the poor from the energy price increase; and (vi) improve institutional
capacity in the government and ANRE for contingency planning and rapid response to an
uncertain evolution o f energy prices inthe medium-term.

79.            Oil and gas price pressures are driven by market forces that are essentially beyond
the influence o f policy makers in Moldova, except for the policies governing energy (gas and
electricity) transits through Moldova. In this area, under PRSC3, the Government aims to
establish Moldova as a preferred route for the energy trade between the CIS energy market and
the Energy Community in South East Europe (ECSEE), which i s a part o f the EU Internal
EnergyMarket. The on-going benchmarking o f the energy sector legislation with provisions o f
the ECSEE Treaty will provide a sound basis for adjustments o f the power market design in
Moldova, including solutions to (i)    cross-border electricity trade and congestion management;
(ii)power system balancing and settlement; and (iii)gradual power market opening.
Furthermore, the Government and ANRE will adopt an action plan for legal and regulatory
compliance o f the Moldova's gas and electricity markets with the ECSEE.              Adopting and
implementing such an action plan would go a long way inimprovingtransparency and regulation
inthe energy sector which are essential inattractingenergy trade and relatedinvestments.

80.            A t the end o f the PRSC program, it i s expected that Moldova's energy intensity,
measured by the total primary energy use (toe) per $1000 o f GDP at PPP rate will be reducedby
10 percent.     Financial discipline in the sector will be maintained or improved, with cash
collection ratios about 90 percent for natural gas and above 95 percent for electricity. Further


                                                  28

cost recovery o f gas, electricity, and heat tariffs for all categories o f consumers (including
households and budgetary institutions) approaches 100 percent, thereby eliminating any source
o f quasi-fiscal deficits in the sector. The poverty and social implications o f these objectives are
explored inthe Poverty and Social Impact Analysis Section o f this document.


Pillar 11: Improvingthe EfficiencyandManagementof PublicResources

A.     Building a Meritocratic Civil Service

81.           Moldova aspires to improve the quality o f the public administration as a measure to
deepen the impact o f the government policies and raise quality o f services to the citizens. Since
approval o f the law on public service in 1995, the Government o f Moldova introduced elements
o f a modern civil service. However, officials agree that the civil service has a deficit o f highly
skilled staff capable o f performing analytical work, developing modem legislation, and
providing high quality policy advice to the policy-making officials.          Raising civil service
professionalism in Moldova will require improved civil service training, performance
management, and adequate incentives. It i s also important to establish a sound legal protection
for unbiased performance o f the civil service duty as required by law, without interference and
undue influence.

82.           For PRSCl, The Government o f Moldova has adopted a Strategy o f Central Public
Administration Reform which sets out an ambitious agenda aimed at modernizing its civil
service to. European standards.      Competitive merit based recruitment and a sound system o f
remunerationlie at the core o f the civil service reform. The approval o fthe new civil service law,
which establishes merit principles in recruitment, defines responsibilities to act in accordance
with the law, obligations to raise professionalism, and rights for legal and social protections i s
the first step supported by PRSC.          The Government plans to adopt a Civil Service Law
compatible with the international practice under PRSC2. Following the approval o f the law and
secondary legislation,      the Government o f Moldova plans to progressively introduce
appointments to the civil service positions only on a competitive basis and according to merit. By
PRSC3, all civil servants appointed to vacant positions will have been selected through
competitive procedure. By that time the Government will have established a civil service
database which will trace appointments, promotions and career changes o f civil servants. The
Civil Service Law shall also establish legal protection o f civil servants against violations o f the
law. The central civil service managing body will ensure supervision o f the observance o f the
law and will act as a first instance o f appeal for civil servants.

83.           At the end o f the PRSC program, all new civil servants to administrative posts in
ministries and central agencies will be appointed through an open, competitive, merit based
selection process as specified inthe new civil service law
B.     Implementing a Transparent and Uniform Remuneration System

84.           A s noted, public sector wages in Moldova are low. The new Law o f Public Sector
Remuneration (2006), which increases the basic salaries for civil servants and differentiates
among 23 various salary grades, has begun to addresses the problem o f low pay in the civil
service (under PRSCl). However, this new system o f remuneration does not fully resolve several
problems: high pay compression; high ratio o f additional payments (base pay is only 25-30


                                                   29

percent o f take home pay); weak guidance for managers on how to implement performance
related benefits; and a lack o f a central database on pay across the various ministriedagencies.
As increments between the salary grades are very small, remuneration does not play a role in
career motivation. The difficulty o f introducing a modem motivating pay system in the civil
service stems from an ineffective system o fjob classifications and absence o f an analytical basis
to establish equitable pay. The factors determining the size o f remuneration for civil servicejobs
are not defined. This prevents the decision on salary levels from using sound analytical basis,
giving rise to perceptions of imbalance between the pay andjob demands and obligations.

85.            The PRSC supports the Government efforts leading towards the modernizing o f the
civil service pay system. The Civil Service L a w should clearly define the scope o f the civil
service which should cover permanent administrative positions in the public administration. By
PRSC2, the Government will develop a modern and efficient system o f classification o f the civil
service posts, including criteria for assessment o f posts against a system o f criteria characterizing
the job (e.g., required level o f knowledge and skills, managerial and decision-making
responsibility, the value of job outputs, etc.). By PRSC3, the Ministry o f Economy and
Commerce in cooperation with the civil service management body, should develop (amend
existing) legislation which introduces transparent and equitable pay and implementation o f that
legislation should commence.

86.             It is expected that by the end o f the program, by consolidating multiple salary
supplements into the base pay, the size o f the base pay should reach at least 75-80 percent o f the
total take-home pay and adequately reflect the value o f the position as measured by views o f
staff in annual public official surveys. Further, incontrast to the current situation, information on
public sector pay in will be centrally available for review and analysis through the development
o f a central financial management information system (under the Public Financial Management
(PFM) project).
C.      Improving the Strategic Allocation of Public Resources

87.            Efficient governments allocate public resources to policy priorities to attain decisive
impact with government programs.         Moldova has been strengthening its resource allocation
processes by introducing an MTEF and expanding the coverage o f sectors included inthe MTEF.
In2006, the Government included agriculture inthe MTEFresource planning in addition to the
existing health, education, and social protection sectors. This priority responds to the sectors
relevance to the poverty reduction strategy. For the first time, the 2007-2009 MTEF i s expected
to have a technical annex on public investment spending. Thus, Moldova has increasingly
focused its public expenditure planning, thereby facilitating the more effective allocation o f
resources to EGPRSP objectives. As part o f PRSCl, the MTEF framework will be approved by
the Government and submittedto Parliament for information inadvance o f the 2007 budget.

88.           The Government realizes that the effectiveness o f the MTEF process can be
improved if the policy priority framework i s agreed in advance o f the MTEF planning.
Therefore, under PRSC2, the Government has agreed to strengthen the central policy
coordination capacity to facilitate Government's agreement on the policy priority framework
early in the MTEF process. Currently, the Ministry o f Economy has developed a policy unit
charged with coordination o f implementation o f the EGPRSP.              This unit has introduced
quantitative monitoring indicators and prepares a report for the Parliament o f implementation o f


                                                 30

EGPRSP objectives. Similar policy capacity i s being established in six line ministries. The
Government agreed that the policy prioritization function should be raised from the
administrative level to the Cabinet level.     This will allow for the development o f political
consensus on policies and help turn the budget into a more effective anti-poverty policy
instrument.

89.           The Government has already committed to establishing a central policy unit directly
reporting to the Cabinet o f Ministers (in the Government Strategy o f Central Public
Administration Reform). The Government has now committed itself to establishing a similar
policy unit inthe Government Apparatus. It i s expected that under PRSC2 the Government will
develop and adopt a legal framework underpinning policy coordination. By PRSC3, the policy
unito ftheGovernment Apparatus will have reachedits operational capacity necessaryto prepare
a proposal on policy framework to be approved by the Cabinet of Ministers as a guiding
document for MTEF. In the meantime, the Ministry o f Economy i s acting as a policy
coordination center for EGPRSC and EU-related priorities. As the capacity o f the Central Policy
Coordination unit in the Government Apparatus reaches adequate level, they will provide
strategic and day to day support to the Cabinet policy decision-making.

90.           K e y to the improved allocation o f public resources i s the effective and efficient
management o f public investment. While there has been improvement in public investment
management processes inrecent years, much work i s left to be done. Inparticular, there i s a need
to better integrate externally financed projects, centralized investments, and other sources o f
public investment into a single common public investment program, as part o f the MTEF
process, with a common procedure for the identification, prioritization, preparation, and
appraisal o f projects. Public investment decisions also need to be better supported by economic
feasibility studies that elaborate on the economic rationale for investment projects, their
projected impact, and whether the outcomes are achieved at lowest cost.             To improve the
allocation o f scarce public resources and sharpen the strategic focus o fpublic investment, PRSC2
and PRSC3 will support, on a pilot basis, the Government efforts to implement new procedures
for public investment decisions.

91.           By the end o f the three-year PRSC program, the strategic focus o f annual budgets
will be improved by the stronger linkage between the MTEF and annual budget laws. Moldova
should also expect to see increased use and awareness o f economic cost-benefit analysis in the
public sector leading to improvements in the quality o f public investment projects selected for
funding.

92.           Restructuring Public Expenditures. Since 2000, the Government has placed a
heavy emphasis on increasing social spending - pensions, social assistance, education, and
health spending comprise over 65 percent o f total general government expenditures. With fiscal
resources scarce, improving the efficiency and targeting o f social spending, particularly in the
education and health sector, will be required if the government i s to achieve the growth and
poverty reduction objectives o f the EGPRSP. Sustained economic growth will also require more
pro-growth public investment spending, particularly on the transportation infrastructure, and an
improved allocation o f agriculture spending to enhance long runcapacity inthat sector.




                                                31

C.1Agricultural Spending
93.           Since 2001, farm restructuring has stalled, with approximately 50 percent o f
agricultural land being used by large, corporate farms that are largely unreformed since the
Soviet collective farm period. These corporate farms are less efficient than individual farms, and
often operate at a loss. To spur growth and poverty reduction in agriculture, the natural process
o f land flow to the more efficient individual farms should be re-energized. This process i s
currently being blocked by government efforts to preserve corporate farms through policies and
public expenditures that allow the accumulation and writing o f f o f debt and channel subsidies to
large farms. By removing these blockages, the PRSC will facilitate continued farm restructuring.
It will also help to create the fiscal space necessary to provide the growth enhancing public
services and investments required to increase the competitiveness o f the new class o f
independent family farmers.

94.           Over recent years, the size and variety o f product- and input-specific subsidies to
the agricultural sector have been growing rapidly. This i s often done without apparent strategic
planning or prioritization in line with the EGPRSP and MTEF. The subsidy programs also vary
from year to year, and actual amounts allocated from the budget can be changed rapidly and can
vary significantly from plan. For example, subsidies under the Agricultural Support Fund(ASF)
alone grew from MDL 36 million in 2004 to MDL 180 million in2005 (compared to a budgeted
amount o f MDL 60 million), and increased again in the 2006 Budget to MDL 220 million. This
represents an increase o f over 500 percent. Inaddition, the nature o f subsidies has changed over
time. While the ASF began by providing credit subsidies that were open to all farmers, more
recent subsidies such as those for Machinery Technology Stations (MTS) and plantation o f
vineyards and orchards are geared towards large, usually corporate or cooperative farms. For
2006, the Agricultural Support Fundincreases Government participation in "picking winners" by
subsidizing the production o f specific crops, such as sugar beet and tobacco, where Moldova
probably does not have a comparative advantage, and which are primarily grown by corporate
farms. The majority o f subsidies for 2006 (MDL 145 million) will go towards the purchase o f
inputs like fertilizers and pesticides. Such programs do not have a track record o f supporting
long-term growth. The Government recognizes the need to reduce such subsidies and use the
resulting fiscal space to increase investments in sustainable growth-enhancing measures such as
development o f standards, research, extension, agricultural education and training, and
investment inmarket infrastructure.

95.           Under PRSC1, the Government has refrained from providing any debt relief for
agricultural enterprises/producers, except in the case o f one-off relief for firms undergoing
privatization. This will force the large, corporate farms that are inefficient and poorly managed to
restructure. The Government has also removed all restrictions on access to subsidies and
supports based on farm ownership structure or size, which will reduce the current bias towards
large farms, increase opportunities for individual farms, and further promote restructuring.

96.           For PRSC2 and PRSC3, Government will begin restructuring o f agriculture
expenditures by significantly increasing expenditure on growth-enhancing services, as a
percentage o f total agriculture expenditures, over the next three to five years and by reducing the
corresponding share o f subsidies.      Within the diminishing expenditure share for subsidies,
priority will be given to measures that demonstrably enhance the long-run productive capacity o f
the sector by supporting the creation o f long-lived assets, for example, new vineyards, orchards,
new genetic livestock strains, etc. The share o f purely recurrent subsidies, such as product or

                                                 32

input subsidies, will be correspondingly reduced. Further, Government will develop and begin
implementing an Action Plan to streamline and modernize the agricultural research, training, and
education system that will include: international benchmarking; rationalization requirements; and
examination o f land and funding needs. Government will also undertake an evaluation of the
existing anti-hail rocket system (which now consumes a large portion o f the Agriculture budget)
and alternative measures.

97.          At the end o f the PRSC program, the share o f subsidies in total agriculture
expenditures will be substantially reduced (from 43 percent of the budget in 2006 to 30 percent
inthe 2009 budget). Correspondingly, within the subsidies category, the increase inthe share o f
capitalhnvestment expenditures will increase to 90 percent o f total subsidies by the 2009 budget.

C.2TransportationInfrastructure
98.          The rapid deterioration o f Moldova's transportation infrastructure over the
transition period has significantly increased the cost and reduced the quality o f transportation
services with a particularly strong impact on the country's poor. The deterioration in public
infrastructure i s particularly noticeable in the road sector, where over 86 percent o f the national
road network has passed the economic lifespan and some 27 percent i s in need o f urgent
rehabilitation due to very bad technical condition.        Currently, the annual budget for road
maintenance represents only about ten percent o f the needed expenditure.           The State Road
Administration (SRA) within the Ministry o f Transport and Communications still operates based
on the Soviet model, with no clear separation o f planning, procurement, and supervision o f road
works.   The present overall situation i s hindering the development o f a strong private road
construction industryand impeding the efficient use o f the scarce state budget resources for road
maintenance and rehabilitation. While the volume, cost, and schedule o f works are defined by
contractual agreements between SRA and contracting companies, the efficiency o f these
companies i s limited due to the lack o f competition inthe contract award process, and also due to
the absence o f a clear linkage between results andpayments.

99.          PRSCZ will support the EGPRSP objectives o f improving the effectiveness o f road
works contracts for maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation through the preparation o f a road
sector strategy that will include a reform o f road financing, introduction o f participation of road
users inthe oversight o f road maintenance financing, and increased competition inthe execution
o f road maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation contracts.     Under PRSC3 the above mentioned
transport strategy and related legislation on road financing reform will be approved and adopted
bythe Government.

100.         By the end o f the PRSC program the actual funding for road maintenance, repair,
and rehabilitation included inthe MTEF (to at least $50 million) will be significantly increased
and [some percentage of] civil works contracts will be awarded competitively.

C.3 Spending on Education
101.         Moldova's public expenditure on education, currently 7.3 percent o f GDP in 2005,
is comparable to OECD and upper-middle income countries. However, there are a number o f
inefficiencies and inequities confronting this sector. In terms of access, Moldova i s lagging
behind many o f its neighbors. Inequities between income groups are acute, with the problem
even more pronounced ifone makes the distinction betweenurban and rural students.


                                                   33

102.          Inefficiencies, mainly resulting from the slow adaptation o f education expenditures
and norms to changing demographics, are reflected in the fall in average studentheacher ratios
over recent years.    Similarly, the average school size i s lower than a few years ago with large
variations in school sizes across the country and between urban and rural areas. A continuing
anomaly in Moldova's education system i s the large number o f non-teaching relative to teaching
staff (non-teaching staff represent 37 to 48 percent o f total staff compared to 27 percent in
OECD countries). Another example o f inefficient spending is high heating costs in education -
the result o fthe highprice o f energy on localmarkets, but also the poor insulation o fmost school
buildings and the large amount o f space per student. While the number o f students in each
school i s falling, the size o f school buildings remains the same with average space utilization
expected to fall to 50 percent by 2010.

103.           The inefficiency inthe public finance o f education is partly due to the methodology
for allocating budgets to schools. There i s little wrong with the per capita financing formula
used, which i s essentially one o f "money follows the student", with per-student allocations
coming from the state budget. The problem i s that school directors are not allowed to use their
allocation flexibly - the amount that they must spend on salaries i s determined by the number o f
teaching hours in their school which i s inturn determinedby the number o f classes (however few
students they may contain). Insome schools with very small classes, the salary bill (based on the
number o f classes) thus exceeds the total allocation (based on the number o f students). Inmany
schools, the high wage bill leaves little or no public money for furniture, materials, repairs, etc.
The formula funding system is generating signals but they cannot be acted on. As a result,
rayons, mayors and schools have to search for ways to make up for the shortfall, including mayor
and village budget resources, local taxes, and extra-budgetary revenues, and the growth o f
"unofficial payments" from individuals i s tolerated.

104.           To improve education quality and reduce the urban-rural gap, the government
program aims to start optimizing the school network and increasing efficiency o f spending. At
present, a school mapping exercise i s being conducted to provide a solid information-base for
improved resource planning. For PRSC2, based on the completed school mapping exercise, a
strategy to optimize school networks will be developed. The strategy will, among other things,
identify schools for optimization, define efficiency target indicators, and pilot a new funding
formula. For PRSC3, the Government will begin implementation o f the optimization strategy
covering at least 20 percent o f identified schools and allocating school budgets under the revised
fundingformula to pilot schools.

105.          By the end o f the PRSC program, studentkeacher ratio, studenthon-teacher ratios,
and the share of expenditures on non-wage quality related items (e.g. textbooks, learning
equipment, teacher training, etc.) will have increased inpilot schools.

C.4.Spendingon Health
106.          Moldovan health sector was pushed into reforms as a result o f the economic crises
o f end 1990s, which saw public health expenditure fall to 2.9 percent o f GDP in 1999-2000 and
real public health expenditure per capita to US$lO, much below regional averages. The
Government responded to financial crisis by closing unnecessary health infrastructure, and
emphasizing more cost-efficient service delivery at primary care settings. Public health
expenditure increased to 4.3% o f GDP in2005, the Government has initiated a public investment
program to modernize hospital equipment, and has spent more on primary care with the

                                                 34

assistance o f donor funding (IDA, Dutch and Japanese Government). The reform agenda
however i s still incomplete and has not yet achieved the original aims o f equitable coverage o f
the country with good quality primary care. The current set-up o f health service delivery by
Rayon Health Authorities, providing both primary as well as hospital care, allows for cross-
subsidies to hospitals from revenues intended for primary care services, weakening primary care
and covering inefficiency in the hospital sector. The number o f vacancies in rural health centers
i s continuously high, with 10-25% vacant family practitioner positions based on the current norm
o f 1500 persons per doctor. Direct contracting with autonomous primary care providers would
increase efficiency and transparency inthe health sector.

107.          The increase in public health expenditure is mainly due to the launch o f health
insurance in2004, with the Government contributing for non-working population groups such as
the pensioners, children, and students. The health insurance coverage i s estimated at 83-84% o f
residents, but rayonhealth authorities provide considerably lower estimates at 60-75%. The main
coverage gaps are among the rural population and urban self-employed, both connected to
contribution collection capacity. Therefore, although the Government contributes to the health
insurance scheme for the non-working population, there i s still considerable risk o f poverty to
cost of illness among the rural population and the self-employed.

108.          The Government intends to pursue reforms to increase equity and efficiency in the
health sector. In support o f this objective, under PRSC2 and PRSC3, the Government will
maintain at least 30% allocation to primary care from the Health Insurance (HIC) budget.
Further, under PRSC2, the Government will (a) prepare a procedure for direct contracting with
primary care centers, and (b) will develop a strategy for increasing health insurance coverage,
including measures for strengthening collections and information campaigns on insurance
benefits. Under PRSC3, the H I C will contract at least 5% o fprimary care providers directly.
D.       Public Procurement

109.          Given the fact that most countries spend from 5 to 15 percent o f their GDP on
public procurement, the World Bank and international and bilateral donors firmly believe that
establishment and maintenance o f an efficient public procurement system can help achieve
substantial savings in public expenditure in Moldova. The Bank has been actively involved in
supporting public procurement reform in Moldova since 1997 when, with the assistance o f the
Bank, a law was enacted on Procurement o f Goods, Works, and Services for Public Needs (No.
1166-XI1 dated April 30, 1997). Since then the Bank has remained engaged in assisting the
Government improve public procurement, most recently through an IDF Grant to the public
procurement agency. Throughout this time a steady improvement in some aspects o f public
procurement has been observed while at the same time a distinct deterioration inthe institutional
framework has occurred.

110.          Under PRSCl, competition for public procurement contracts was increased with a
significant drop in the number and value o f public procurement contracts awarded using sole
source and a steady increase in the number and value o f contracts awarded through open
tendering. However, there i s still some progress that can be made to reduce the amount o f
restricted tendering.




                                                35

111.          Under PRSC2, the Government will address the pressing need to reform the
institutional framework by reestablishing the Public Procurement Agency as an independent
entity under the Cabinet o f Ministers, responsible to the Prime Minister. This will be coupled
with a steady increase in the human resources o f the Agency from the present 7 persons to a
maximum target o f 35 persons by the time o f PRSC3. At the same time, the Agency may
establish a moderate regional presence with small offices in the north and south o f the country.
The newly reestablished Agency should develop a clear Action plan covering 2006-2010
(ratified in time for PRSC2) which should cover items such as: development o f the Agency,
development o f a national training and certification program with at least 80 persons trained by
PRSC3.

112.          By the end o f the PRSC program, the level o f sole source procurement and open
tendering will remain below 10 percent and will rise to at least 70 percent, respectively.          If
additional effort i s made to increase open tendering to 75 percent by the end o f the PRSC
program, then Moldova could become rated "A" under the PEFA Indicator-19 (Competition,
value for money and controls inprocurement).
Pillar 111: Strengthening Pensionand Social AssistanceSystems

A.       CompletingPension System Reform

113.          Although the administration o f the social insurance system has improved in the last
three years, outstanding issues still need to be addressed. The 1999 reform o f the pay-as-you-go
pension system has met some o f its short-term objectives, such as makingpension payments on
time, in-cash (as opposed to in-kind),and without the need for budget transfers. Pensionreform,
however, remains incomplete and the general pension law (1999) i s not being fully implemented.
The EGPRSP lists the following four areas as major unfinished business: (i)     financial stability o f
the (pension and social insurance) system; (ii)  fragmented and non-uniform pension legislation;
(iii)significantand,inmanycases, unfairredistributionofresourcesamongdifferentcategories
o f insuredpersons; and, (iv) relatively low levels o fpensions and indemnities.

114.          The 1999 reform law mandated that pension payments be made based on actual
paid contributions rather than on stated wages to reduce uncertainties o n revenue-expenditure
gap, increase transparency, and improve equity. Nevertheless, this reform objective has not yet
been completed. Originally, the contribution-based pension payment was planned to start in
January 2005. While the National Social Insurance House (NSIH) has progressed in developing
the IT system, supported by the Social Protection Management Project, the contribution data
entry into the system has experienced significant delays. More than a year after the original
target date, 75 percent o f the needed data has been entered. Although the recently initiated
scheme o f submitting contribution data through electronic formats i s an indicator o f positive
progress, the contribution-based pension payment i s not likely to start until after January 2007.

115.          Other major issues in Moldova's pension system include the pension privileges for
certain categories o f the population and certain sectors as well as agricultural pensions.
Privileged pensions are in effect for several groups in the population, including the military,
prosecutors, civil servants, Chemobyl liquidators, and members o f Government. These pensions
are considerably higher than those received by general pensioners. These special pensions are
received by roughly only 2 percent o f old-age pensioners but amount to about 14 percent o f
public expenditures. Although the Government has not introduced new categories o f privileged

                                                 36

pensions, eligibility criteria have been somewhat loosened during the recent years. Because the
beneficiaries o f the privileged pensions are socially and politically influential, phasing out o f the
privileges has been difficult. Consequently, the privileged pension expenditures are increasing.

116.           Issues relating to agncultural pensions are even more complex.             There i s a
substantial redistribution from non-agricultural workers to agricultural workers.          Currently,
agricultural workers contribute 20-22 percent o f their wages to the pension scheme while their
pensions amount to nearly half o f all old-age pension expenditures. This problemwas not solved
through the 1999 pension reform, even though agncultural pensions were reduced to 85 percent
o f those o f non-agricultural workers. Contributions for agricultural workers are set at a very low
level.

117.           To continue pension reforms, the Government plans to: (i)implement the
contribution-based pension payment benefits; and (ii)     unify the pension system for all types o f
pensioners (non-farmers, farmers and privileged).         Under PRSCl, the Government has: (i)
reduced data entry back log o f individual contribution so that 100 percent o f 2005 contribution
data submitted to the Pension Fund has been entered into the computerized contribution
database; and (ii)  developed an agricultural pension reform strategy.

118.           For PRSCZ, (i)  the pension law will be amended to enable pension payments to be
made based on individual pension contributions; and (ii)     the Government will adopt a strategy to
unifythe pensionsystem for all types o fpensioners (non-farmers, farmers andprivileged). Under
PRSC3, the Government will begin: (i) pensions based on contributions registered in the
                                            paying
individual accounts; and (ii)  implementing the strategy to unify the pension system.

119.           At the end of the program, (i)individual accounts will have been established for
100 percent o f all known pension contributors, meaning that all contribution data (declarations)
received by the Pension Fund will have been entered into the computerized contribution
database; and (ii)correlation between contributions and payments will have increased for all
types of pensioners (targets to be determined during appraisal).
B.      Enhancing the Distribution Efficiency of Social Assistance Benefit

120.           Today Moldova's social assistance system consists o f some 13 types o f cash
benefits. The largest o f all i s the energy and housing subsidy called "nominal compensation",
which is meant to be targeted towards the poor and vulnerable households. The total expenditure
has averaged slightly above 200 million lei/year for approximately 250,000 beneficiaries. The
"nominal compensation" transformed the former system o f privileges into a categorically
targeted program focused on relatively more vulnerable population.            In light of recent and
projected increases in energy prices, this program could have a critical role in reducing the
adverse shock on the poor and the vulnerable (A PSIA analysis on this impact has been
undertaken).

121.           One o f the major issues in Moldova's social assistance system is the targeting
efficiency. "Nominal compensation" and all other social assistance programs employ some form
o f categorical targeting. However, Type Iand Type I1errors both appear to be high. Over the
last few years, it i s estimated that the poorest 20 percent o f the population have received only 6.6
percent o f total social assistance benefits. It was also estimated that roughly 45 percent o f the


                                                   37

benefits are received by the non-poor.       Given the extent o f in-kind and informal income in
Moldova, any type of income targeting is likely to lead to substantial errors o f inclusion; thus
some type o f categorical targeting may be a necessity. Nonetheless, it i s still necessary to
improve the targeting o f social assistance programs to ensure that they are focused on the poor
and the vulnerable.

122.          Another major shortcoming i s weak record keeping and information sharing across
the various social assistance programs. At present, social assistance programs are administered
by several government agencies, including NSIH, Ministry o f Health and Social Protection,
Territorial Social Assistance Offices, and Territorial Social Insurance Offices, each o f which has
independent beneficiary registries and payment databases. The existing arrangements make it
very difficult to assess the overall impact and effectiveness o f social assistance programs to the
government. They also make it more difficult for the poor and the vulnerable to access social
assistance programs.

123.          To improve targeting o f social assistance programs and gain efficiency in program
administration, the Government's reform agenda focuses on: (a) developing and adopting a
strategy for improved targeting for social assistance programs, in particular, the "nominal
compensation" program; (b) undertaking a financial and impact assessment o f social assistance
programs; (c) developing and implementing an information system for improved record keeping
and information sharing; and (d) consolidatinglrationalizing the administration o f social
assistance programs.

124.          Under PRSC2, the Government will: (i)      adopt a time-bound social assistance reform
action plan for improved poverty targeting including converting some o f the categorical targeting
to mean-tested ones, and (ii)    design a unified database o f the beneficiaries o f cash-equivalent
social assistance programs. Under PRSC3, the government will: (i)       begin the implementation of
the action plan; and (ii)start the installationo f the unified database.

125.          By the end of the program, it is expected that the share o f poverty-targeted social
assistance program budget inthe total social assistance program budget will have increased.

                            VI.     OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

                         A.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS

126.          The PRSC team has endeavored to assess the likely distributional consequences of
major policy reforms supported by the proposed credit on the welfare o f different stakeholders,
with a special focus on the poor and vulnerable. While such policy reforms are aimed at
promoting efficiency in the use of public resources, accelerating economic growth, and fostering
poverty reduction, particularly in rural areas where the poorest households reside, adverse
distributional consequences inthe short-run are nonetheless possible inat least three components
o f the proposed operation. These include interventions aimed at achieving the following: (i)
supporting the Government's efforts to maintain cost recovery energy tariffs by continuing to
allow full-pass through o f energy price increases; (ii)implementing the strategy for optimizing
school networks; and (iii)  capping budget share o f expenditures on agriculture subsidies. Inlight
o f these potential social consequences o f reform, recent analytics on the social impact o f rising
energy prices, options for reform inthe education sector, and mitigation measures for easing the


                                                   38

reform process have informed the PRSC preparation process. The PRSC team has also been in
close consultation with Government and other key stakeholders, along with the donor
community, to discuss the preliminary findings from these analyses.

127.          Raising energy tar$i to cost recovery levels. Allowing energy tariffs to rise to full
cost recovery levels and facilitating a full pass-through to consumer o f recent energy price
increases-while      maintaining hard budget constraints on energy producers, suppliers, and
consumers-can promote energy conservation, energy efficiency and investment in the
modernization o f utility assets.     The government has in place a social assistance system,
including natural gas and energy compensation, to assist poor and vulnerable households. In
2005, about 2 percent o f GDP was allocated toward social assistance, with utility subsidies
accounting for 40 percent o f this amount. And while cost recovery tariffs for natural gas have
beeninplace since 2000, a lifeline tariff also covers monthly consumption up to 30 cubic meters.
The budget for natural gas and energy subsidies has been increased in response to the price
shock. The government has indexed its budget allocation for natural gas and energy
compensation (including subsidies for firewood and charcoal) to offset the two rounds o f gas
price increase and protect recipient households from the gas price shock in 2006. In particular,
the government recently allocated 15.7 million lei in additional funding for gas and energy
subsidies, to account for the recent increase innatural gas prices inJuly.

128.          However, given that the Government maintains a categorical targeting system, in
the short-run such a reform program may have unfavorable social implications. In the recent
World Bank "Note on the Impact o f Energy Prices Changes inMoldova", which was deliveredto
the Government and discussed at a press conference during the pre-appraisal mission, the
analysis indicated that higher energy costs have had a significant impact on the poor since these
consumers have little capacity to reduce already low demand inresponse to rising energy prices.'
Further increases inthe cost of energy will certainly create additional pressure on the budgets of
the poorest households. The note calculates that the likely fiscal cost o f protecting the energy
consumption o f the poorest households i s within the current spendingenvelope. The PRSC team,
drawing from the results o f this analysis and a chapter on social protection (in the forthcoming
Public Finance Review), has also encouraged the government to develop better targeted social
safety nets for the most vulnerable groups in the economy. A pilot program for means-testing i s
currently underway.        The impact on vulnerable groups will be monitored using quarterly
Household Budget Surveys.

129.          Optimizing the school network. The proposed operation supports an educational
reform strategy that involves piloting the optimization o f the school network to promote more
efficient use o f public resources in the education sector by decreasing the share o f non-teaching
staff in total employment, lowering overhead costs, and bringing pupil-teacher ratios closer to
international (e.g., OECD) norms. However, such an optimization program may generate fiscal
savings that may be allocated toward quality-enhancing education inputs (such as textbooks), but
may have important social consequences as well, at least in the short-run. For example, the
program may lead to greater out-of-pocket payments for selected households or communities
(e.g., to pay for commuting costs), particularly in the rural areas. There may also be nontrivial

public employment losses (and subsequent pockets o f political resistance against) associated
with such a program. Inaddition, the reformprogram may need to take into account variations in
local capacity for managing mergers, as this may lead to increases in geographic disparities in
school quality. The forthcoming Moldova Public Finance Review on the education sector
calculates the fiscal savings from such a strategy, but nets out the cost o f protecting the access to
education services o f the poorest households by subsidizing commuting costs and the cost o f
providing separation packages to retrenched staff.

130.          Capping budget share of expenditures on agriculture subsidies. Government
expenditures on agnculture are relatively low in Moldova compared to other countries in the
region. Further, there i s little or no empirical evidence indicating that subsidies for agricultural
inputs such as fertilizer, irrigation operations, energy, and pesticides have benefited the poor.
Indeed, the Government's restrictions on these subsidies by farm size suggest that these benefits
were received by larger (i.e. wealthier) farms. The proposed operation i s supporting the
restructuringo f agricultural expenditures by redirecting expenditures on agriculture product- and
input-specific and insurance subsidies towards growth enhancing measures, including agriculture
services and capital expenditureshnvestment. With restrictions on farm size removed, these new
expenditures will likely benefit small (i.e. poorer) farmers.
                   B.       IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORINGEVALUATION
                                                               AND

131.          The administration o f this credit will be the responsibility o f the Ministry o f
Finance.     To facilitate program implementation and the coordination o f activities, the
Government has appointed an Inter-ministerial Steering Committee chaired by the First Deputy
Prime Minister. This Committee is composed o f representatives o f key Ministers. The Steering
Committee will be assisted by a Technical Committee comprising high level staff from various
line ministries, including the Ministries o f Agriculture and Food Industries, Economy and Trade,
Education, Finance, Industryand Infrastructure, Health and Social Protection, Transportation and
Telecommunications, and the Moldova Customs Service.

132.          A multi-donor supervision effort will be aligned with the existing government-led
monitoring and evaluation system for the EGPRSP, the Moldova-EU Action Plan and the MTEF.
The Steering Committee will be responsible for monitoring the PRSC program and all
benchmark and outcome indicators. These benchmarks and indicators can be found inthe PRSC
Policy Matrix in Annex 2. The specific benchmarks and outcomes to be monitored have been
drawn from the Government's overall development program, thus providing significant benefits
inreducing transaction costs for the Government. The overall reform effort will be reviewedby
the Government in close coordination with regular multi-donor missions to ensure continued
implementation o f the program within an adequate macroeconomic policy framework. Given
satisfactory progress, Moldova's reform program will be supported by subsequent PRSCs under
the programmatic lending framework, subject to the approval o f the Board o f Executive
Directors.

133.          Pubic Financial Management (PFM). Strengthening public financial management
is an important part o f the public sector reform component o f the EGPRSP. The PFM section o f
EGPRSP largely incorporates recommendations o f a series o f diagnostic reports (Public
Economic Management Report (PEMR), Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA),


                                                  40

Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)) produced in close collaboration with the
Government. The priority areas o f activity under the Government PFM reform strategy include:
(i) improvingpublic resource allocation by introducing modem budget preparation practices; (ii)
strengthening financial discipline by modernizing the treasury system and budget execution
procedures; (iii)improving public debt management to minimize debt service costs; (iv)
improving fiscal administration and increasing the effectiveness o f financial controls; (v)
increasing the efficiency o f budget management through introduction of an integrated financial
management information system; (vi) harmonizing the budget and fiscal legal framework with
EuropeanUnion standards.

134.                The progress achieved in implementation o f the strategy by the end o f 2005 i s
captured in the PFM performance report based on the PEFA (2006) methodology through a
multi-donor effort. The overall conclusion o f the report i s that weaknesses in the current PFM
system in Moldova are mainly due to institutional capacity issues typical for a country in
transition. The fiduciary risk assessment annex to the report notes that Moldova remains a high
risk country but has good chances to improve its rating to "medium" risk provided ongoing
reforms are implemented effectively and efficiently. The progress achieved in the main areas o f
PFMreforms and the remainingweaknesses are summarizedbelow.

135.                Budgeting. The Government has been undertaking noticeable efforts to consolidate
the budget formulation process to address the PEMR and CFAA findings on its fragmentation.
The Law on budgetary system and budgetary process was amended in 2004 to introduce the
concept o f National Public Budget". The MTEF, introduced in 2002, has a three year time
horizon and i s updated annually on a rolling basis. It integrates with the national public budget
framework approved by the Government at the inception phase o f the annual budget cycle.
Extra-budgetary means and extra-budgetary funds (amounting to less than 10% o f Central
Government budget) are integrated in the MTEF and the annual budget documentation. The
PRSC supports further development o f the strategic focus o f the MTEFthrough establishment o f
a central policy unit to support the Cabinet o f Ministers in defining medium-term policy
priorities. The remaining weaknesses inthe budgeting area noted inthe PEFA report include the
need to maintain adherence to the existing budget calendar and improve expenditure planningat
the line ministry level linking it to sectoral policy priorities. Further strengthening o f budget
formulation methodologies i s a component o f the PFMproject currently under implementation.

136.                Internal controls over the budget execution. Moldova has made important progress
in developing the national treasury system. Controls over budget execution have been
significantly strengthened through gradual expansion o f the treasury coverage that started in
1997 with the state budget only and has now expanded to include the budgets o f territorial
administrative units, extra budgetary funds and means, and the revenues o f the social and health
insurance budgets. Expenditures o f the latter two budgets, as well as the donor financed
contributions to investment projects, however, remain outside the treasury operations. This i s an
area requiring further improvement in the treasury coverage. The PEFA report identifies a
number of weaknesses related to treasury operations. The proper model of the treasury single
account is missing at the moment and i s being developed under the PFM project, and also being
monitored by the IMF under the new PRGF program. The PEFA report also points to a need for


loThe national public budget is composed of: (i)Statebudget; (ii)State Social Insurancebudget; (iii)

territorial units; (iv) funds for compulsory insurance for medicalassistance.

further improvements in cash management and forecasting. Until 2006, no regular cash forecast
updates were prepared, but the practice was improved this year through introduction o f monthly
updates (part o f the CAS high case triggers). The solution still has to be found on the mode o f
communication o f the cash availability information to the spending units that could prevent them
from creating unfunded commitments and generating arrears. Improvements are also required in
monitoring o f arrears, as information on the arrears' age profile i s unavailable. All o f the above
weaknesses are being addressed under the PFM project. PEFA report also notes the relative
weakness o f the treasury controls over payroll expenses, which i s relying primarily on integrity
o f accounting staff o f spending units (since the payroll function i s performed by each individual
spending unit using either manual calculations or separate isolated IT modules, payroll lists are
not reconciled with personnel data). The FMIS being designed under the PFM project envisages
a pilot payroll module as a first step inaddressing the weakness.

 137.             Procurement. The 2003 CPAR concluded that the public procurement system was
weak and needed substantial strengthening. Single Source Tendering (SST) was happening "far
too often, often in contravention o f the procurement law".                        In 2001, it was reported that 67
percent o f all contracts used SST. CPAR recommendations formed the basis for the
improvements undertaken by the Government in the procurement domain in the last several
years (part o f the CAS high case triggers). The Public Procurement Law was amended and the
Public Procurement Agency was authorized to register contracts before they can be processed by
treasury, with particular attention paid to SST cases. As indicated by the PEFA report, based on
the data for 2004-2005, the SST practice has been significantly reduced (SST cases accounted
for 8 percent o f the total number o f contracts and 10 percent o f their overall amount in 2005),
while the percentage o f contracts awarded usingopen tender procedure reached 22 percent o f the
total number o f contracts and 57 percent of the overall amount in 2005. With the assistance o f
the Bank IDF, the new Public Procurement law was drafted (but i s still to be approved) to bring
Moldova closer to the international standards in this area, and capacity building activities for
public procurement agency and spending units were conducted.'' There remains, however, a
concern about the sustainability o f the progress achieved, related to the lack o f clarity on the
status o f the Public Procurement Agency. Its recent merger with the Agency for Material
Reserves, Public Procurement and Humanitarian Aid has created a direct conflict o f interest
undermining the independence o f the public procurement function.l2The PRSC program
supports measures to improve public procurement through: (i)                          enactment o f the new Public
Procurement Law13, including provisions for independent Public Procurement Agency; (ii)
further decreases inthe number and value o f contracts under SST, and increases inthe number o f
contracts and value o f contracts awarded by open tender.

138.             Accounting and reporting. The Government i s preparing for important changes in
public sector accounting and reporting in the context o f the PFM project. The new integrated
budget classification and chart o f accounts system i s being developed on the basis o f the

GFS2001 standards to be launched with the new FMIS.The existing budget classification, which
i s broadly compliant with GFS 1986, i s expected to be in use at least until 2008. There i s an
ongoing program to replace, within the same timeframe, the multiple versions o f the chart o f
accounts currently in use by different levels o f budget entities with a unique chart o f accounts
compliant with cash-based IPSAS. The Ministry of Finance is also developing a strategy to
introduce accounting standards for the public sector and sequence accounting reforms. It i s
expected that in the medium-term the Government will maintain cash-based accounting for the
treasury and modified cash based accounting for the budget institutions. The new FMIS will
enable the Government to produce consolidated financial statements showing financial position
o f the Government, and not only the budget execution reports, as i s the practice at the moment.

139.          Internal auditing. The internal auditing function o f the Government i s at an early
stage o f its development. Small internal audit units have been established in the Ministry o f
Finance (MOF), State Tax Service, Customs and National Social Insurance House. In addition,
there i s a Control and Revision Service (CRS) under the Ministry o f Finance. Inmost cases, the
CRS i s performing ex-post verification o f budget execution. Development o f the modem internal
audit function within the Government is a component o f the PFMproject.

140.          External auditing. PEFA report mentions that the Court o f Accounts (COA) at
present i s largely carryng out transactions level testing. Audit methodologies require hrther
improvements despite introduction o f a number o f internal manuals and guidelines following the
2003 CFAA. Modem audit concepts were introduced into the Court o f Accounts Law through
2005 amendments. PEFA report observes the need for the Parliament to pay sufficient attention
to the audit reports. The current system o f nominating members to the top management body o f
the COA does not guarantee independence and i s prone to political influence in the working o f
the COA. The Court o f Accounts has indicated its willingness to develop into a modem external
audit institution along the EUcounterparts. Technical assistancehas been offered by the Swedish
and British national audit offices to support the implementation o f the COA Strategic
Development Plan.

141.          PFM reforms and immediate measures needed to strengthen public financial
management framework. Weaknesses in public financial management system are well
understood in Moldova and a broad PFM reform program is under way. Major assistance i s
already being provided by the Bank through the PFM Project, co-financed by SIDA and the
Dutch Government. The PFM project i s supporting improvements in: (i)       budget preparation and
budget execution methodologies; (ii)accounting and reporting; (iii)development o f Financial
Management information system and cash management; (iv) internal auditing; (v) building
sustainable domestic capacity for PFM related training. In coordination with the PFM project,
DFID is providing support to the strengthening o f the MTEF process, and TA for the Court of
Accounts i s beingplanned by the donors. Several highpriority reform measures are included in
the IMF's PRGF and the proposed PRSC (as indicated in the sections above). The existing
instruments already mobilized through a concerted multi-donor effort appear to be sufficient to
support the critical PFM agenda. No additional fiduciary risk mitigationmeasures are considered
necessary for the present PRCS operation.

142.           Disbursement and Funds pow. The proposed Credit, SDR 6.8 million (US$10
million equivalent), will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy
lending. The Credit will be disbursed in one tranche immediately upon effectiveness and is not
tied to any specific purchases and no procurement requirements will be needed. The funds will
be deposited at the existing treasury USD a c c o ~ n t 'opened by Ministry o f FinanceIState
                                                                       ~
Treasury with the NBM, which forms part o f the official foreign exchange reserves. The
government will utilize the proceeds o f the credit in foreign currency for crediting the local
currency equivalent into the treasury single account for financing budgeted expenses. If, after
depositing the Credit proceeds, the proceeds are used for ineligible purposes, the Bank will
require the recipient to refund the amount directly to the Bank, in which case the Bank will
cancel an equivalent un-disbursed amount o f the credit.

143.           Accounts and Auditing. The administration and accounting o f the Credit proceeds
will be the responsibility o f the State Treasury o f the Ministry o f Finance. The standard country
rules will be followed by treasury for administration and accounting. The Government will
maintain accounts and records, or ensure that such items are maintained, showing that credit
disbursements were in accordance with provision o f the Financing Agreement. Such accounts
and records will be maintained in a form acceptable to the Bank.             The proceeds o f Credit
deposited at the treasury account with NBM will be used for converting into local currency to
cover budget expenditures. The MOF will be responsible for the Operation's administration and
for preparing the withdrawal application, maintaining the deposit account as required. The
Operation will be subject to ratification by Parliament before it becomes effective. The MOF,
with the assistance o f the NBM, will maintain records o f all transactions under the Operation in
accordance with sound accounting practices. Within 30 days of the NBMbeing credited, the MOF
will provide to the Bank a confirmation that the amount o f the Operation has been credited to an
account that i s available to finance budgeted expenditures.

144.           The IMF had conducted a Safeguards Assessment (SA) o f the National Bank o f
Moldova (NBM) in 2002 and noted that general quality o f the financial reporting at NBM i s
satisfactory. The Safeguard Assessment identified a few weak areas including: (i) lack o f an
                                                                                        a
independent supervisory board and audit committee; (ii) accountingpolicies for calculation
                                                                     weak
o f distributable profit to the Government; (iii)vulnerability o f NBM loans to governments
becoming impaired; and, (iv) lack o f properly functioning internal audit department. The NBM
has made major efforts in establishing a modem internal audit department. NBM financial
statements have received unqualified (clean) audit opinions from international auditors for the
past three years in a row. The management letters issued by the auditors in 2004 and 2005 did
not contain any significant internal control issues. In view o f this, there are no additional
fiduciary safeguards considered necessary as far as management o f the deposit account i s
concerned.
                                     E.        ENVIRONMENTAL         ASPECTS

145.           The PRSC team has made an effort to assess and address the likelihood o f
significant effects o f policies supported by the PRSC on the environment, natural resources, or
forests including assessment o f the government's systems for reducing adverse effects and


l4Usedfor receivingsupport from donors and for makingexternal payments.

enhancing positive effects. There are three areas o f the proposed PRSC that may require further
attention with respect to environmental issues. These are policy interventions aimed at
implementing the following: (i)    reducing the regulatory burden; (ii)removing agricultural export
restrictions; (iii)
                  passing the full cost o f energy price increase to customers; and (iv) introducing
cost-benefit analysis inpublic investment planning.

146.          Reducing the regulatory burden. The PRSC supports ongoing efforts to reduce the
regulatory and administrative costs o f business regulation and promote private sector
development and boostjob creation. The PRSC builds on the Government's recent enactment o f
the "Guillotine" law mandating a comprehensive review o f business executive regulations,
leading to the identification o f regulations that are no longer necessary or do not have legal basis.
This exercise has had a limited impact on environmental regulation so far. Of the 99 regulations
identified by the Guillotine process for elimination, only [four] are related to environmental
regulations, most of which were found to have inadequate legal basis. As the Government
moves forward and implements next stage o f the regulatory reform strategy, it i s not clear how
the new requirement will impact the environmental licensing system, if at all. The PRSC team,
along with the Competitiveness Enhancement project will monitor the likely impact, including
any unintendedconsequences, o f the next stage o f the regulatory reformprogram.

147.          Removing agricultural export restrictions. The PRSC i s              encouraging the
Government to adopt a number o f measures to develop agricultural markets by liberalizing
agricultural exports. In principle, the increased profitability of agnculture activity may lead to
the so-called "extensification" or encroachment o f previously forested lands for agriculture
production. It may lead to "intensification" with rising use o f harmful fertilizers and pesticides
leading to soil degradation, water run-off, and a general degradation o f water quality with
attendant health impacts.

148.          On the other hand, there are offsetting developments and ongoing programs as well
as institutional safeguards that mitigate potential environmental effects o f "extensification."
First, the Forest Code and several environmental laws in place prohibit the transfer o f forest
lands for agriculture production. Moreover, a number o f ongoing projects financed by the World
Bank are serving to mitigate the likely effects o f increased agricultural activity. For example,
among the components o f the Bank's "Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPS) Stockpiles
Management and Destruction Project" are those aimed at institutional strengthening, the
modernization o f current legislation (Le., those related to the Stockholm Convention), and the
introduction o f broader chemical safety approach inthe country consistent with EuropeanUnion
legislation. The project also has a special activity under Component 2 (Prevention o f new
Stockpiles o f Obsolete Pesticides) that aims to provide support in promoting best practices in
Pest Management in crop production, including Integrated Pest Management. Furthermore, the
"Renewable Energy from Agricultural Wastes GEF Project" i s promoting the use o f biomass for
heat-in    place o f fossil fuel-through    the efficient use o f primary agricultural wastes. The
project aims to demonstrate (by installing demonstration biomass units technologies used in
neighboring countries) practical and efficient use o f agricultural wastes, such as cereal wastes,
typically burned on the field. Furthermore, the GEF "Agricultural Pollution Control Project" i s
expanding the use o f environmentally-friendly agricultural practices by farmers and agricultural
enterprises to reduce nutrient discharge from agricultural sources to the Danube River and Black
Sea. Between 1990 and 2002, Moldova also experienced modest rates o f reforestation (about
600-700 ha annually) Between 2002 to 2006 it has also afforested by about 7,000 hectares

                                                   45

annually, thus extending the forest cover by about 35,000 hectares. Moreover, the program
managed by the WE3 PCF's "Soil ConservationProject" i s aimed at helping restore to productive
use some 20,000 hectares o f degraded agricultural lands.

149.           Raising energy tarus. The World Bank i s recommending an increase in domestic
gas tariff in response to the recent increase in the price o f imported natural gas and to pass the
full cost o f the increase to consumers. This measure, by allowing energy prices to reflect their
real cost, is aimed at encouraging consumers to save energy and use energy more efficiently. In
the short-run, however, such price increases are likely to have distributional effects. The rising
cost o f energy may have substantial health and environmental consequences, as households
consume cheaper, and often dirtier, sources o f fuel. For example, the elevated use o f dirty fuels
may degrade air quality and pollution may in turn lead to the deterioration of population health.
Moreover, widespread burning o f wood promotes deforestation. It may then contribute to the
loss o f critical environmental functions provided by forests and trees.

150.           The World Bank i s supporting two measures aimed at mitigating the likely
environmental effects o f households switching to dirty fuel. First, the World Bank i s encouraging
the Government to improve the targeting o f energy subsidies to shield the poorest households,
the same households more likely to switch energy sources, from the impact o f rising energy
costs. Second, a number o f ongoing projects supported by the Community Carbon Development
Fundmanaged by the World Bank are promoting energy conservation (Energy Conservation &
Emissions Reduction) and the development o f less expensive, and cleaner, heating systems
involving some 240 communities (Biomass Heating inRural Communities Project).

151.           Introducing cost-benefit analysis in public investment planning. The PRSC i s
strengthening the capacity to carry out public investment planningby gradually introducing cost-
benefit accounting. While major infrastructure investments may indeed have environmental
impacts, the rationale for introducing economic analysis to the planning process and into
environment impact assessment procedure i s to assess the broader costs o f any major public
investment, including its longer-term environmental costs.
                                            F.     R I S K S

152.           The risks for this operation include (i) fiduciary risks; (ii)
                                                                            implementation capacity
at the central and decentralized level; (iii)external shocks; and (iv) political economy risks.

153.           Fiduciary risks remain high and should be monitored.               The Government's
continued efforts to strengthen public financial management and procurement systems are
reducing fiduciary risks with regard to the use o f public funds, but they remain high. To mitigate
the risk, the Government must continue to push forward on implementing the recommendations
and reform measures outlined in the most recent CPAR, CFAA, Public Finance Review (PFR)
and PEFA. The PRSC program, as well as the Bank's and donor's work in these areas, i s
providing assistance to the Government inthis endeavor.

154.           Implementation Capacity is a medium risk. The Government has limited
institutional capacity which could delay the implementation o f the reforms. For instance, should
PRSC resources be used to finance higher capital spending, as indicated by the Government,
most line ministries have limited capacity for the systematic selection and appraisal o f projects,


                                                  46

implementation, and evaluation. This may lead to the sub-optimal allocation o f budgetary
resources. To mitigate these risks, all the reform areas benefit from Bank and donor-supported
TA and capacity buildingprograms or investment operations (see Box 2).

155.         Destabilizing external shocks are a high risk. Moldova and Russian state oil firm
Gazprom may reach an agreement to increase Moldova's gas prices to European levels o f
$llO/mcm in early 2006, up from $80/mcm in the previous three years. Negotiations with
Gazprom would lead to still higher gas prices (up to $160/mcm in2006 and potentially higher in
the coming years). As noted in the PSIA section, the increase in natural gas prices may have
significant poverty and fiscal implications. Inparticular, this raises the cost o f energy consumed
by households and enterprises. The burden o f the price increase may fall disproportionately on
the poor and on households with limited alternative sources o f fuel. The price increase also
creates two sources o f budgetary pressures. First, it raises the cost o f energy procured by
government. Second, it leads to pressures for increased energy subsidies and transfers limiting
resources available for investment spending.       Under this operation, the Bank i s promoting
reforms to improve the efficiency o f the energy sector. The Bank, along with the IMF and other
donors, has some flexibility in the amount o f PRSC financing to respond, if needed, to external
shocks.

156.         Political economy risk may delay key elements of the program. Moldova's past
uneven commitment to policy reform creates some uncertainty that the Government will
implement some o f the more politically challenging reform items on the EGPRSP agenda and
that a stop-and-go cycle for reform may once again emerge. However, recent progress on
implementing the reforms underlying the high case triggers, and a visible political commitment
to the EGPRSP and EU-Moldova action plan give some comfort that the reform agenda laid out
inthose strategies will be pursued. Inaddition, the EGPRSP participation process has created a
strong national consensus for the reform program. Similarly, Moldova's EU aspirations are
widely shared among the population.

157.         The close linkage between the PRSC-supported reform agenda and substantial
donor assistance (DFID, SIDA, the Netherlands and EU) planned for Moldova i s a mitigating
factor. The Government has also prepared the Letter of Development Policy, spelling out its
own reform agenda (see Annex 1). In a number of sectors where the resistance to reform by
vested interest i s expected to be strong, such as agriculture, road maintenance contracting, social
assistance, and pensions, the operation i s bolstered by coordinated donor advocacy for trade and
Private Sector Development reform, proposed Bank and donor projects (Le. road rehabilitation),
and the government's own champions o f pension and social assistance reform.

 Moldova's Reform Program for Economic Growth and PovertyReduction

Dear Mr.Wolfowitz:

The Economic Growth andPovertyReductionStrategy (EGPRSP) representsthe
supreme policy framework for a medium term sustainable development of the
Republic of Moldova and the achievement of the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). The strategy sets out objectives and priorities, achievement of
which is feasible in a medium term, but is also necessary to fulfill global long
term objectives that come out of provisions of the Government's Plan of
Activities "Revival o f the Economy- Country Revival," the EuropeanUnion-
Republicof Moldova PlanofActions, and correspondto standards and practices
generally acceptednationally, as well as internationally.

      These objectives are:
      i)       sustainableand sociallyorienteddevelopment;
      ii) countryreintegration;
      iii) Europeanintegration.

Inorder to achievelongterm developmentobjectives inadynamic and efficient

 The poverty reduction support credit aims to support the Government in the
 implementation o f the EGPRSP. Given that EGPRSP and the European Union -
 Moldova Action Plan are in the final implementation phase, the Government
 intends to revise and adjust both of these strategic documents. The current
 EGPRSPwill be extendedto 2007 by updating the policy matridactionplan and
 estimate costs. At the same time, the Government will initiate work to update
 and extend the EGPRSP together with the programming process under the EU-
 Action Plan for 2008-2010period.

 A. BACKGROUND

    I.PovertyProfileandPovertyTrends

 Since 2001, the Republic of Moldova has seen important progress in ensuring
 and maintaining a strong economic growth. The GDP increasedby more than 30
 percent, while the rate of absolute poverty fell by 41 percent, reaching the level
 of 29 percent in 2005. Nevertheless, GDP per capita remains low, and living
 standards are far inferior to those in the EuropeanUnion. Poverty and a lack of
 competitive employment opportunities have triggered massive labor migration,
 and this phenomenonhas given rise to new social and macroeconomic problems.
 Remittances, estimatedat about 30 percent o f GDP, stimulate consumptionbut at
the same time complicate the conduct of monetary and foreign exchange policy.
Migrationalso serves to erode the tax base.

However, despite all efforts made within the program of general reforms,
Moldova remains, by any standard, to be a poor country, i s positioned on the
 113" place out o f 177 countries, according to the 2004 Human Development
Report, having aHumanDevelopment Index (HDI) at 0.68 1(data from 2002).

The poverty profile of Moldova is conditioned by economic, but also partially
demographic factors, including: (i)low productivity o f labor in the farm sector;
(ii)insufficient developmentofregionaleconomies; (iii)agrowingnumberof
persons supported by the active population (Le. pensioners); (iv) low levels o f
pensions and social allowances; and, (v) significant differentiation of wages
among various sectors of the economy. In 2005, poverty is also spread out
unevenlywith the highest poverty incidence being in small towns (48.5%), while
poverty in rural areas is slightly lower (42.5%). Poverty in big cities is the
lowest (14.7%).

                                          3


 Poverty kept on falling inurban centers, but inthe rural areas, where 63% o f the
 country's population lives, it grew during 2004 and 2005. The high poverty
 incidence in rural areas is determined by stalled farm restructuring and lack o f
 progress in "individualization" o f agriculture, inadequate public support for the
 emerging class of family farmers, the difference inprices for farm and non-farm
 products that ensued from the liberalization of prices, the relatively low
 productivity o f labor and small incomes o f persons employed inagriculture.

     11. Source o fEconomic Growth

 The revival o f the national economy has been accompanied by an exacerbation
 o f the disequilibrium between the size o f internal demand and the volume of
 production. The growth rate o f final consumption in the 2000-2002 period was
 twice as large as the GDP growth rate. As a result, the size of final consumption
 for each o f these years exceeded the GDP by 1-3 percentage points. The main
 factor responsible for the rapid growth in consumption has been the growth in
household consumption resulting from an increase in the sizes o f pensions,
 salaries, allowances and compensations, as well as the massive in flux o f
remittances.

Although the net effect on the GDP - growth o f imports counterbalanced by
higher growth of consumption - was still positive, the sustainability of such
model is questionable. Therefore, the challenge is to evolve to an investment-led
growth model.

Growth rates and the results o f economic development will depend to a great
extent on the environment surrounding enterprise and investment activities, both
at national, as well as local levels. For the medium term, the Government will
undertake measures to improve substantially the investment and business
climates by promoting a stable, transparent and efficient regulatory policy, by
developing competition and supporting small and medium businesses. This will
mobilize the economy's         investment potential,   made up o f remittance
accumulations, resources o f the banking sector and the shadow economy,
concessional official     development assistance, as well as foreign direct
investment.

Inorderto changethe paradigmandquality ofgrowth, it isnecessaryto mobilize
new resources and factors o f growth, by attracting a considerable volume o f
investments, first o f all inthe processing industry and in infrastructure, so as to
diversify the economy and replace labor force export with export o f service and
merchandise.

     1II.Creating Fiscal Space

 Public investment in Moldova is low. In order to increase public investment,
 without undermining macroeconomic stability or increasing the already large
 share of Government expenditures as a percent o f GDP, fiscal policy will need to
 remain tight. The Budget will need to focus on ensuring efficiency of public
 expenditures, as well as on redistributing existing resources from programs o f
 smaller importance to priority programs that have a substantial impact on
 economic growth and poverty reduction. Resources will be allocated among
 sectors based on an analysis o f sector expenditure programs, taking into account
 factors o f strategic influence over the development of sectors, as well as
 possibilities to streamline expenditures in some sectors identified within the
 mediumterm expenditure framework.

     IV.    SoundMacroeconomic Framework

        FiscalPolicy
 Over the last years few years, fiscal policy has remained tight. In 2005, the
 surplus o f the general government grew to about 1.6 percentage points o f GDP,
 due to additional revenues, and the necessity to accumulate resources on a
 special account aimed at reducing arrears on external debt to Paris Club
 creditors. Starting from 2005 the Government also accumulated sufficient
 resources to start to repaying credits previouslyreceived from the National Bank
 o f Moldova (payments inthe amount of Lei 127 million, or 0.3 percent of GDP,
 were made in2005).

 The budgetary process has been improved as a result of the implementation o f
 our Medium-TermExpenditure Framework (MTEF), and by preparingestimates
o f the national public budget, including the state budget and local government
budgets, the state social insurance budget and the compulsory medical insurance
budget, as well as special funds. In order to broaden the tax base, VAT
exemptions have been eliminated on agriculture, as well as on the import and
supply o f pesticides and fertilizers, equipment, technology and complimentary
parts. The VAT rate on medicines has been increased from zero to 8 percent.

       External Debt Policy
Inthe absence of external financing for the budget, external debt service became
a serious burden for the budget, reaching 40 percent of the total state budget
revenues (2001). Throughout 2003-05, the general government reported primary
surpluses o f about 2% percent of GDP, and Moldova's external debt indicators
improved significantly. Robust economic growth over this period as well as
prudent limits on external borrowing allowed the Government to reduce the ratio
o f public and publicly-guaranteed debt from 79 percent o f GDP in2000 to about
33 percent of GDP in2005.

                                        5



ParisClub creditors agreedon 12May 2006 with the Government ofMoldovato
a restructuring of its external debt in accordance with the so-called "Houston
Terms". This agreement followed the International Monetary Fund's approval of
Moldova's arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility on 5
May 2006 insupport o f the Government's ambitious reform program. As aresult
of this restructuring, expendituresaimedtowards externaldebt service beforethe
Paris Club throughout the implementationof the program signed with IMF fell
fiom $149.9 million to $60 million, thus contributing towards a better economic
outlook andproviding additional fiscal space for the reform agenda.

       Monetary andExchangeRatePolicy
The key challengeof monetary policy during 2005 was managingthe pressure of
foreigncurrency inflows. These inflows were mainly associatedwith remittances
sent by Moldovan workers from abroad, which put considerable pressure on the
level of inflation and the exchange rate. During most of 2005 there was upward
pressure on the leu, and it took considerable effort on the part of the NBM to
bring inflation back down from near 15 percent inthe first part of the year to 10
percent by end-year. This was achieved despite strong growth in energy sector
prices. With energy prices continuing to rise in 2006 inflation pressures are
expectedto mount.

The NBMproposedan amendment to its main law by moving towards inflation
targeting and away fiom the dual objective of prices as well as exchange rates.
This reinforcesthe floating exchange rate regime, by which the NBMintervenes
only to smoothout excessivevolatility inthe exchangerate. During2005 the real
effective exchange rate of the leu registered an appreciation of 2.4 percentage
points, relative to December 2004. Reserves grew by almost $130 million in
2005, reaching2.2 months ofprospective imports at end-December.

At the same time, Moldova's external vulnerability continued to grow. Largely
owing to the external shocks coming from higher energy prices as well as the
recent wine exports ban from the Russian Federation, the trade balance
deteriorated by almost 9 percentage points of GDP in 2005 and continued to
worsen into the first half of 2006. This calls for an urgent diversification of
Moldova's export markets which remain limited at the moment, reflecting
continued dependence on traditional CIS markets. In 2005 the CIS absorbed
about 51 percent of total Moldovan exports (comparedto only about 30 percent
went to EU markets) out of which the wine exports to Russian Federation
accountedfor almost aquarter.

 B.     KEY PILLARSOF THE PROGRAM

            I.GENERALSTATEMENT

 The economic growth fiom past years occurred in the background o f a slow
 economic restructuring, o f a fall inthe rate o f industry growth, especially of the
 processing sector. Rise in the final consumption and the gross capital
 accumulation is determined to a great extent by the flux o f incomes coming from
 citizens o fthe Republic o f Moldova working abroad and partially by the increase
 in salaries. Given these conditions in the situation o f low level of investments,
 vulnerability to external factors, the outlook o f a sustainable growth and poverty
 reduction may become uncertain if urgent actions are not undertaken to redress
 the situation. These actions would include among other: (i) optimization
                                                                  actual
 o f the business climate; (ii)improvement in the management o f state assets, and
 (iii)promotion o fthe public-private partnership.

 The low level o f public expenditures targeted towards financing capital
 investmentsinhibits opportunities for a future economic growth. Inthis context,
 it is necessary to establish a tax regime that will allow for the generation of
 resources that will be targeted towards public investments.

 The results following the implementations o f several programs of social
 assistance are rather insufficient, especially given an inefficient allocation o f
 public resources. The lack o f financial resources makes it impossible to satis@
 the demand for social services, thereby causing an expensive widely covering
 institutional support. The government is aware that the present system for social
 assistance needs revision, so that the poorest parts ofthe population are protected
andconcomitantly, a fiscal sustainability o fthe system is ensured.

Starting with the motivation to adopt important and radical changes, the
Government undertook the management and implementation roles, with support
from the poverty reduction support credit, inthe realization of a program based
onthe following major pillars:
      (a) improving the investment climate;
      (b) improving the efficiency andmanagement o fpublic sector resources and
      (c) strengthening social protection systems.

I. Improvingtheinvestmentclimate

For the medium term development period, the main target i s to ensure significant
improvement o f the investment climate so as to create accelerated growth
opportunities of private internal and external investments. The major objectives
o f the state policy in this area are macroeconomic stability and the promotion
public sector reform including that o fthe regulatory fi-amework.

                                           7



 Along with the main objectives o f the general policy, it is envisioned that other
 mediumterm tasks will also be accomplished towards improvingthe investment
 climate, such as: (i)improvement o f the legislation to protect the rights o f
 investors and creditors; (ii)  limit the barriers to investment activities; and, (iii)
 improve the incentive-based tax regime for local and foreign investors.

 An important element in the improvement of the investment climates resides in
 the fight against corruption. As a rule, enterprise activities are most affected by
 corruption. It is recognized that corruption i s very expensive for entrepreneurs.
 To a large extend, corruption affects economic agents inthe process of obtaining
 licenses and when undergoing various inspections. The poor population from the
 rural area i s also affected as such, especially the population running commercial
 activity. The Government believes that eradication o f corruption i s a crucial
 condition for ensuring the continuation in economic growth and poverty
 reduction. The Government approved a set o f legislative and normative
 documents aimed to provide a legal framework which would prevent and fight
 against corruption. An extensive list o f anti-corruption measures i s envisaged in
the National Strategy o f prevention and fighting o f corruption and in the action
plan for the implementation o f this strategy. Objectives of this strategy are
correlated with actions, which are intended to be implemented by the
Government within Threshold Program to meet eligibility conditions for
"Millenium Challenge Corporation" find.

               A. Regulatory framework reform

Regulatory reform       - which was initiated by the Government in 2004 and
continued throughout the year 2005 - aims to create open, flexible, and low-cost
business opportunities inorder to promote investments and business innovations.
Only such conditions can offer the possibility for the Moldovan economy to
rapidly adjust to new market risks and opportunities, and thus the possibility to
ensure competitiveness o fthe localproduction.

This reform, which represents a compIex and a long-term effort, presumes two
major phases: (i)deregulation and streamlining, and (ii)consolidation o f
capacities for good regulation within Government institutions. Duringthe years
2004-2005, some actions were undertaken for the first phase, namely: (a)
simplification and centralization of the licensing procedures, (b) optimization of
the registration procedure, (c) diminution o f conflicts of interest between
inspectors and the function of checking conferred to control agents. The Law on
the revision and streamlining o f the normative framework regulating enterprise
activity (the regulatory guillotine) was drafted and implemented, which led to a
significant reduction in the number o f normative acts regulating enterprise

                                           8


 activity, as well as for the reduction in costs surrounding authorization
 documents.

 The Law on Basic Principles and Mechanism for Enterprise Activity Regulation
 was adopted by the Parliament. This starts the next new phase o f reform,
 representing a higher level o f revision o f legislation, namely revision of laws and
 decisions o f the Parliament.

 Regulatory reforms provide necessary but not sufficient conditions for
 establishment of more competitive enterprise sector inthe Republic o f Moldova.
 Global markets have become increasingly stringent in terms o f product quality
 and performance. Conformity with international standards such as IS0 9000 has
 become a de facto requirement for external market access. Upgrading the
 framework for measurements, standards, testing and quality (MSTQ) i s a
 necessary first step in gaining access to the foreign markets and boosting
 competitiveness.

 WTO membership andthe EU/Moldova Action Plan, which underlines European
 integration, placed strong accent on the necessity o f upgrading the MSTQ
 system. The Government started developing a three-fold strategy focusing on: (i)
 upgrading existing MSTQ institutions to international levels (including obtaining
 relevant international recognition),     (ii)improving existing services and
 introducing new MSTQ services (all based on demand from Moldovan
 producers), (iii)promoting use o f MSTQ services by enterprises to improve
 quality and conformity with international standards; and (iv) development o f
 capacity with regard to supervision o f production quality and consumer
protection in line with the European Union practices. Significant improvements
 in the legal MSTQ framework have already taken place, with a number o f
important laws adopted.

B.Improving trade facilitation

Improvement o f the investment climate also involves simplification and
streamlining o f procedures for border crossing and Customs clearance. That
includes reduction in the number o f documentary and physical controls, which
can lead to better export competitiveness, attraction o f foreign investment and
better integration inthe global economy. With support from Trade and Transport
Facilitation in Southeast-Europe project, the Customs Service o f the Republic o f
Moldova has already made important steps towards reducing clearance time and
promoting trade.

In this context, starting from January 2006 the Customs Service initiated the
implementation o f risk analysis and selectivity, with the goal to improve results
and efficiency o f clearance procedures. The system will be augmented by the

                                           9


 introduction o f post release audit. That is expected to lead to simplified and
 rationalized Customs procedures while increasing the detection o f irregularities
 and thus compliance on equal conditions by the business community. The whole
 process will enable the Customs Service to reduce the frequency o f physical
 inspectiono f imported goods and substantially reduce import clearance time.

 In April 2006, the Risk Analysis Unit within Customs Service started to
 introduce into the selectivity module o f the Automated System for Customs Data
 (ASYCUDA) World Informational System the first risk criteria that were
 established following various analysis and studies performed. The Customs
 System switched to selectivity during the process o f Customs clearance. All
 external economic transactions are examined through ASYCUDA World to
 evaluatethe risk factors andpossible impact on the economy.

 Development of a sustainable reporting system will be an important element in
 the monitoring o f performance at border crossings and during Customs
 clearance. The Customs Service plans to implement a "single window stop"
 principle for document processing both at border crossings and at the inland
 clearance terminals.

 The implementation o f the "single window stop" principle was initiated by the
 Customs Service at its main terminal o f Chiqingu, starting fiom April 2006. This
 involves submission of Customs documentationat the entry/ reception points and
their return at the moment o f merchandise physical control; that eliminates
 contact of the Customs officer with the economic agent, and thus reduces in
 frequency o f corruption.

Elimination o f duplication o f procedures, by reducing the number of agencies
present at border crossing points, will also contribute to greater efficiency and
improved trade facilitation. The performance indicator o f the ongoing project of
Trade and Transport Facilitation in the Southeast Europe is reduction of the
average time needed for import clearance as well as for the border crossing entry
time to 30 minutes.

             C.Developrnent o f agricultural markets

The largest real sector of the national economy, which i s also directly dependent
on the investment climate, is agriculture. This sector has an important role to
play both in poverty reduction - because it is the main occupation o f a large part
o f the population on the poverty threshold, but also because it serves as an
importantsource for industrydevelopment and export growth.
The growthrate of the agricultural sector remains modest. During2001-2005 the
volume o f agricultural production only increased by 16 percent. Agriculture
remains the sector yielding the lowest productivity and labor remuneration

                                          10


 indicators. Contributing with 18% to GDP (nearly 30% when agroprocessing i s
 included) and offering jobs to about 45% o f the labor force, the low productivity
 and insignificant growth rates in the agricultural sector have negative
 implications for the growth perspectives for the economy. The poverty rate is
 highest among farmers and farm workers (at the level of 45-50% in 2005), which
 despite some improvements in earlier years, started growing again in 2003. The
 recent poverty estimates for the Republic o f Moldova clearly shows that the
 poverty rate among farmers and farm workers has increased in last two years
 (2003-2005) by at least 12percentage points.
 The Government is committed to promoting sustainable economic growth, in the
 agricultural sector in particular, by enhancing sector competitiveness and
 encouraging private initiatives and investments. The Government reconfirms its
 commitment to implement sound agricultural policies and support all types o f
 farm structures that exhibit efficiency and productivity enhancements towards
 developing a competitive and profitable agricultural and rural economy,
 operating on market principles.
         These market principles include no minimumprices or fixed prices o f any
 kind; no designated buyers; no export restrictions; no licensing requirements for
 import or export; no determination o f landto be planted under particular crops or
 production levels to be achieved; and no government institutions assigned to
 administer the production or processing of any crop.
       The Government recognizes the Land Code as a fkndamental piece o f
 legislation framing land relations inthe country, and reaffirms its commitment to
respect a land code that adheres to market-oriented principles, namely that it: (a)
clearly defines and protects landowners' rights; (b) provides for the enforcement
o f real property rights through efficient institutions and effective courts; (c)
facilitates and supports secure transactions o f property rights, backed by formal
contract procedures, and provides a court system that settles any disputes in a
timely manner; (d) provides for property rights information to be available to all
persons who request it; (e) puts restrictions on transactions only under
exceptional circumstances in conformity with existing legislation; (f) facilitates
registration and transactions at low cost with minimum fees and taxes in the
shortest possible time after application; and (g) protects land as a resource on
environmental and health grounds.


One of the main challenges facing the sector is the problem o f low producer
prices. A critical step needed to address this problem i s increased market access
for producers and enhanced competitiveness o f the sector. In the context o f
agricultural export liberalization, the Government has canceled the legal
requirement regarding the export o f grains taking place exclusively through the
Universal Commodity Exchange. This requirement not only places a constraint
on cereal exports, but also favors the big players on the domestic cereal market,

                                         11


 thus reducing the competition and pushing down the producer prices. A
 Decision, No. 946, removing this compulsory requirement was adopted by the
 Government on 18tho f August 2006. It is expected that this action will contribute
 to reducing the gap between the domestic producer prices and the international
 parity prices for cereals and oilseeds by at least 25% by 2009 (as measured by
 the 2006 Nominal Rate o f Protection (NRP) compared to the 2005 W).To
 explore this issue further, the Government, inconsultation with the World Bank,
 has developed the terms ofreference for a study on improvingthe stabilization o f
 cereal prices on the domestic market.
 The Government assumed the responsibility to implement an Action Plan (to
 follow the approval o f the Agricultural Strategy for the period 2006-2015) that
 would include, inter alia, (i)liberalization of the import regime for seeds and
 seedlings, (ii)improving certification and standardization system for agricultural
 products, and (iii)development and dissemination o f a Market Information
 System to inform farm producers on a regular basis about market opportunities
 and trends, both domestically and in major regional markets (such as Romania
 and Odessa). The Government believes that these three issues are of major
 importance for the future development and efficient finctioning o f agricultural
 markets in Moldova, as well as for the creation o f a competitive and profitable
 production sector.
        Moldova farmers pay more for inputs relative international markets.
 Liberalization o f these markets is a Government priority.      Specifically, the
 Government is committed to undertaking a set of measures for the liberalization
 o f the present import regime for seeds and seedlings and plant materials, by
 improvingand streamliningthe national regulatory system for the registrationo f
 new varieties, acknowledging the fact that a free and quick access o f Moldovan
 farmers to new advanced technologies is a precondition for the domestic
 agricultural products to achieve a higher competitiveness on global markets.
Following the implementation of these agreed measures aimed at liberalization
ofthe seed market, it is expected that the number o f newly registered varieties in
the Republic of Moldova will increase in the next years (until 2009) by at least
25%.

Over the longterm, the Government will work towards adopting the EUregistry
o f plant varieties to enable its farmers to have access to the best available
international technology that is embodies in these varieties. In the meantime,
farmers access to the best international technologies should be enhanced by a
reform o f the Moldovan plant variety registration system involving a significant
reduction in the evaluation period; a reform o f the composition o f the National
Council to exclude interested parties from membership;              and by the
establishments o f an independent appeals mechanism for rejected applications.
The Government acknowledges the importance of harmonizing national
legislation with European and international standards, especially given the

                                          12


 current critical need to enter new markets that are more stable and more secure
 than the traditional ones. This will also require changes in institutions and
 approaches, as well as significant investment. Towards this end, the Government
 has already begun the implementation o f the National Program for the
 development o f technical regulations. The Ministry o f Agriculture and Food
 Industry (MAFI), as the party responsible for developing the 31 Technical
 Regulations related to agricultural and food products, has managed to approve so
 far 12o fthose, the remaining 19 to be drafted and approved by the end o f 2006.


 Credit is an essential input to agricultural production, and it i s currently a major
 constraint for farmers. The Government has been working with the World Bank
 through the Rural Investment and Services Projects (RISP Iand 11) to increase
 farmers' access to credit by supported rural Savings and Credit Associations
 (SCAs). These SCAs      - covering more than 530 associations and 96 thousand
 members - can contribute to the sector's fbture growth and development.
 Further, SCAs give access to financial services for a large part o f the population,
 which do not have access to traditional services of the banking sector. Despite
the accomplishments obtained, the system o f associations faces a series o f
 important challenges, such as a great number o f small associations, an
 unsustainable support system, and an outdated legal fkamework. The rapid
 growth in the size o f member deposits and the inefficient supervision of
 association activities also represent major challenges for the system. To ensure
the long-term sustainability o f the SCAs, it will be necessary to improve the
legal and regulatory environment for their supervision. The Government,
therefore, will soon finalize the draft law on savings and loan association, based
on the most successfbl international practices. Establishment o f a new legal,
regulatory and supervisory framework will ensure a favorable environment for a
prudent and sustainable growth o f the system of associations, will contribute to
the development o fbusiness, andthus to a rise inincomes andpoverty reduction,
especially inthe rural areas.

              D.Reducing energy vulnerability
Reducing the vulnerability o f Moldova to external energy price shock is a
serious challenge facing the Government. Rising energy prices, particularly the
increase inthe price of natural gas, have reemphasized the need improve energy
efficiency and to diversify types o f energy and sources of energy supply to
Moldova. Without improvements in energy efficiency and diversification o f
energy supplies, the rising energy prices may have a significant negative impact
on the already low level o f competitiveness o f local production, as well as the
livingconditions o fthe population.
The Government recognizes that a sound tariff policy is key for the improvement
of energy efficiency and the diversification o f energy supplies. Therefore, the
Government will help ensure that tariffs for natural gas, electricity and heat are

                                            13


 gradually adjusted to the full cost recovery level for all categories of consumers.
 It will also help ensure that cash collection ratios are maintained above 90% for
 natural gas and above 95% for electricity. If successfully implemented, these
 measures would help attract investments in energy efficiency projects in the
 public and the private sector causing the reduction o f energy intensity o f
 economy. The tariff policy will be also a cornerstone o f an energy efficiency
 program which the Government will develop and implement to help improve
 financial viability o f energy enterprises, including Termocom.
 The Government will revise the existent legal and regulating framework, to the
 aim of adopting and implementing an Action Plan for ensuring legal conformity
 o f gas and power markets in Moldova with norms established by the Energy
 Community of the South-Eastern Europe. In addition, focus will also be placed
 on drafting new normative acts in non-regulated areas - thermal energy,
 renewable energy sources, and adoption of the National Program for capitalizing
 renewable energy sources by the year 2010.

 11.    Increasing efficiency and improving management of public sector
 resources

The general objectives o f the medium and long term tax policy is based on the
following principles: (i) ensure stability and predictability of public revenues;
                           to
(ii) ensurefiscalequity; (iii)tostimulate economic activitybyrationalizing
     to
the system o f tax incentives, so as to preserve those incentives that are targeted
towards supporting economic growth and poverty reduction.

At the same time, the conclusion o f the evaluation of public expenditures and
financial responsibility shows that the relationship between actual expenditures
and the budget is sound, as a result o fthe revenue surplus following the positive
economic evolution and improvement in the tax administration. In general, the
control and monitoring of the budget execution are goodandare accompanied by
well-established procedures. At the same time, we are aware that Moldova's
system o f internal control and audit no longer meets the requirements o f
effective financial management at the organizational level. The Government
plans to establish a system o f internal control and audit compatible with EU
requirements for Public Financial Internal Control ftamework. Although the
system o f public procurement is improving, the need for improving awareness,
practice, and enforcement ofprocurement legislation is significant.

Improving access o f the population, first o f all o f the poor, to basic medical
services through primary medicine development, to qualitative educational
services, consolidation ofthe financial stability inthe social insurance system, as
well as streamlining o f the social service delivery system by targeting these
services towards the most poor, represent the main challenges facing the
Government in the upcoming medium term. The policies proposed through the

                                          14


 credit for poverty reduction are aimed to improve efficiency and resource
 management inthe public sector.

  The Republic o f Moldova has undergone major and radical changes over the
 transition period which, along with integration into international structures,
 demand that the public administration in general and the Government in
 particular adapts to new requirements. The Government has assumed the
 leadership in implementing a reform o f the central public administration as one
 of its priorities.    This reform will contribute to increasing the country's
 international competitiveness by establishing an efficient administration, capable
 o f attaining policy objectives adopted by the country's leadership.
 A.     Meritocratic civil service
 The objective o f the reform that started o f f in the second half of 2005 is to
 establish a modern and efficient system o f central public administration, in
 accord with the European Union's principles of good governance. The reform
 implies the transformation and modernization Moldova's public administration
through the reorganization o f the central public administration, optimization o f
the decision-making process, and establishment o f a professional civil service.
The Concept o f the Public Service Personnel Policy, approved by Parliament
(resolution No.1227-XV o f July 18 2002) envisages introduction a competitive,
merit-based system for staff recruitment and selection in the civil service. This
would ensure objectivity and transparency in the hiring o f personnel in public
autorities which, in turn, would lead to better professionalism. These objectives
have not lost their importance today and the Government i s hlly committed to
the implementation o f the stated objectives. In the context o f the mentioned
Concept, the Government approved a Regulation which establishes the manner
in which contests to select candidates for vacant civil service positions are
organized and held, as well as the method of conflict resolution inthe respective
area. Inthe absence o f effective enforcement o f merit principles, the adherence
to this Resolutionstill gives concerns to the Government.
To ensure that civil servants are competitively selected the Government, based
on the results o f the functional review o f the Governmental Apparatus, will set
up a civil service management structure, responsible for the implementation and
monitoring o fthe civil service reform.

Inorder to create a professional group o f permanent civil servants that would be
responsible, accountable, impartial, efficient, and accessible by citizens, the
following objectives are to be accomplished:
    -   designing a new system o f classification and grading of civil service

   - strengtheningthe central coordinationo fhumanresources management;
        positions;

                                         15

     -  improving a system of financial and non-financial incentives for civil
        servants.

 To achieve the mentioned objectives, the Implementation Plan for the Strategy
 for Central Public Administration Reform (SCPUR) provides for a series o f
 actions to be realized over 2006-2008. One of these actions provides for the
 drafting in the second half of 2006 of the L a w on Civil Service and Statute of
 Civil Servants. The draft law will, among other issues, include provisions
 regulatinghiring for public service and merit-based promotionof civil servants.
 After the adoption of the respective law, the Government will design, adopt and
 implement new legislative provisions regulating human resources in the civil
 service.

 B. Implementing a transparent and uniform remuneration system for civil
 servants
 The Government has already taken some measures to the conditions of civil
 service remuneration, as well as of persons responsible for technical maintenance
 o f public authorities. The base salary levels were raised (the share of the base
 salary in the total salary increased from 22% to 55%), while several increases
and supplements were reduced or annulled altogether.

The process aimed to improve the incentive-yielding system for civil servants
will continue throughout the next two years. In the first semester of 2007
especially, a system for civil service remuneration will be drafted, which will
consolidate the existing allowances and supplements into the base salary in line
with the new classification and gradation of civil servants. The variable part of
the monthly salary shall be comprised ofperformance bonuses.

C. Improvingthe Strategic Allocation o fPublic Resources

The preparation o f the MTEF in Moldova as a tool for medium-term strategic
planning during the last five years underpinned the reform of methods and
procedures regulating budgetary planning. The budgetary legislation was
amended to ensure that the MTEF is an indispensable part of the budgetary
cycle. The MTEF serves as a strategic framework for the national budget and
facilitates the process of preparation and examination of the annual budget. The
implementation      of MTEF has        increased  transparency    and   improved
understanding of the budgetary process within the Government and the civil
society.

The MTEF for 2007-2009 is based on an analysis o f sectoral expenditure
programs.It provides for a better correlation between sectoral policy priorities
stipulated inthe EGPRSP and other srategic documents and process o f resource
                                                         -                      -

allocation. It was also based on a detailed analysis of expenditure programs,

                                           16


 including strategic expenditure planning in four pilot sectors: education, health
 protecton, social assistance and the farm sector, which, given the set out
 objectives, determine the reform actions within the programs, with implication
 on budgetarymanagement andperformance indicators inthe respective areas.

 The MTEF includes a technical note on the analysis of public investment
 expenditures, as well as related medium-termpriorities. Ininfrastructure sectors,
 the priority will be given to the sectors with greater social and economic impact.
 For the following three years, the priority sectors for investment will be road and
 transport infrastructure, the energy network, water supply and sewerage. These
 areas are considered o f priority in the context of Moldova's integration with
 European structures as well.

 The Government will establish a unit for strategic planning within the
 Government Apparatus, which will be responsible for advising the Government
 on medium-term policy priorities and for the methodological coordination o f
 strategic planningunits inpilot-ministries. The MTEF for 2008-20 10 will reflect
 a cost-benefit analysis o f major investment projects with internal financing for
 two sectors o fthe national economy. Startingwith the MTEF for 2009-2011,the
 Government, following a proposal by the strategic planning unit, will adopt an
 annual resolution, which will set out priority sectors within medium-term
 expenditure policies.

 D. Agricultural Spending

 The Government recognizes the need to re-think and streamline the agricultural
 spending, since the current system has showed to exhibit a number o f
weaknesses and shortcomings. Thus, within the current system the small farmers,
which have proved over the years more productive than the large ones, often lack
state financial support. In addition, most government programs are targeted at
product- and input-specific subsidies, which have a short-sighted effect and do
not promote sector growth. Therefore, the Government is committed to re-direct
agricultural expenditures towards growth- and productivity-enhancing activities
and long-term capacity improvements. The need to create incentives to
restructure agricultural enterprises, and promote the individualization o f
agriculture and better use o fresources is also on the Government's agenda.
The Government recognizes that             practices   involving cancellation or
accumulation o f farm debts are counter-productive and do not stimulate financial
discipline. For this reason, the Government will undertake the necessary
measures to exclude such subsidies starting next year (2007). Exceptions to the
general rule will be made only for old debt o f those state farms that undertake
privatization and restructuring will be taken on a case by case basis.
The Government is aware that the development o f agricultural services
(including extension, training, education, research, marketing, infrastructure

                                           17


 services, such as wholesale markets, cooling storages, packaging units, etc.)
 plays an important role in competitiveness enhancement process o f the farm
 sector. The second component o f agricultural expenditures, called subsidies, will
 be reduced year by year: in2007 the share of subsidies will drop by 3 percentage
 points, and in 2008-2009 by 5 percentage points o f total agricultural
 expenditures.
 Subsidies are, in turn, divided in two categories: recurrent subsidies (amounts
 allocated to specific agricultural products/inputs) and investment subsidies
 (plantation o f vineyards, orchards). Within the limit set for subsidies (as a share
 o ftotal agricultural expenditures), the investmentcomponent will increase, while
 the recurrent one will reduce with the objective of reaching the ratio o f 90%/10%
 by the year 2009, the biggestpart pertaining to investment subsidies.
 The Government agrees that setting equal rules o f the game within the state
 supported schemes i s an absolutely necessary condition allowing establishing
 equal opportunities for all producers - regardless o f the farm ownership
 structure, legal form or size o fthe enterprise/farm- and  eliminating inefficiency-
 yielding distortions within the sector. This objective will serve as a basic
 principle in the development of any future state-supported program in
 agriculture. In addition, the eligibility criteria that are currently in place for
various state support programs will be revised towards eliminating/amending the
provisions that allow for a subjective approach or non-transparent procedures for
public resource allocation.
 At the moment, a thorough assessment of the existing research, training and
education system i s required. Inthis context, a separate study will be carried out
to investigate this important topic, and the help of the WB in the field of
international benchmarking will be particularly useful. In addition, the
Government will carry out an evaluation o f the anti-hail rocket system currently
applied in Moldova, and based on the cost-benefit       analysis will decide on the
continuatiordtermination o f the current system. The study will also contemplate
some alternative system(s) suitable for the Republic o fMoldova.

E. Transport Infkastructure

According to the agenda o f EGPRSP objectives for the year 2004-2006, the
reform o f road transport infrastructure includes the implementation o f a program
o f commitments stop the degradation of the road network and start its gradual
reconstruction, create a sustainable system for sector financing, modernize the
technical evaluation o f roads, and negotiate with international financial
institutionsto obtain credits for projects aimed at rehabilitating the national roads
ofEuropean importance.

The country's road network infrastructure has considerably deteriorated during
the transition period: of the total 3,325 km o f national roads, 87% have passed

                                         18


 their economic lifespan and some 30% are in a very bad technical condition.
 About 95% of the road network is paved, but most of these roads do not
 correspond to the technical standards.

 Creationo f a sustainable andtransparent system o f road financing i s a priority on
 the agenda of central and local public administration. To that end, the
 Government plans to invest more in the sector - including through increased
 annual budget allocation - while focusing on road maintenance and repair to
 reduce the backlog on national roads in poor condition. At the same time, the
 Government will address the existing spending inefficiencies in the sector
 through gradually improving the management capacity o f the State Road
 Administration and clarifying its role and functions, and improving the
 competition in the award o f road maintenance and repair contracts.             The
 Government is also considering developing a partnership with the private sector,
 including foreign companies, to rebuildand manage national roads.

 Implementation o f modern systems for road technical evaluation and for the
 optimization of maintenance and repair processes will be addressed by the
 strategy for transport infrastructure management and financing which the
 Government intends to draft throughout the following year. Based on the
 adopted strategy and regulations on sustainable and transparent road financing,
the Government will substantially increase available financing for road
maintenance.

F. EducationSystem

Policies regulating the education system represent one of the most important
factors inthe development o f the human capital, which inits turn constitutes one
of the pillars at the base of economic growth and social cohesion inthe country.
Acknowledging the important role that education has and considering
constitutional provisions, as well as other commitments, the Government o f the
Republic of Moldova formulated the following general objective in EGPRSP:
Ensuring access to quality education and ensuring the efficient and sustainable
finctioning o f the education system in a way, which facilitates its role in
developing humanresources and the economy. Inthe same time, one o fthe main
MDGfocuses on "achieve universalprimary education."
Education expenditures have declined compared to the 1990s (reaching 7,3% o f
GDP for 2005),but are still higherthanthe OECD average (4.9%). The system is
characterized by inefficient use of financial, human and material resources.
Allocation o f public finances to schools i s regulated by a formula o f unit
financing leustudent. Various expenditure requirements, however, limit the
flexibility o f use o f the education budget.. The greatest portion o f education
spending is on teacher salaries (more that 60%) and on utilities (about IS%),

                                           19


 with quality related expenditures constituting only about 10% of education
 budget.
 The education expenditures per pupilvary significantly among institutions, by 2-
 3 times. The ratios of pupilheacher and pupilhon-teachers are low. The lack o f
 didactic materials and the lack o f modern means of teaching lead to reduction o f
 the quality o f studies, having a negative impact on the level of assimilation o f
 newinformation.

 Another issue is the widening social inequality inMoldova, which contributes to
 reduced access to education of vulnerable social groups. There are significant
 differences regarding access to education o f children from rural and urban
 localities. The completion ratios o f rural students in secondary and higher
 education is 76% and 6%, respectively. This compares with 81 % and 29% for
 students from urbanlocalities.

 Inorder to improve the quality o f education and to reduce the gap betweenthe
 urbanandrural village, the Government setthe objective to optimize the network
 o f schools and to increase efficiency o f public resources spending. For these, the
 process o f mapping institutions o f general education was completed, which
 includes more than 150network and economic-financial indicators. Based on the
 school mapping exercise for general education institutions, measures will be
 taken for the optimization of the institutions inrural areas. By the end o f 2009, it
 i s planned to reorganize 20% o f schools identified as candidates for
 optimization. School mapping also will help with definition of basic package o f
 free education services.

Inaddition, existingfinancingformula will be revised for schools -pilotedunder
the project called "Quality education in rural area o f Moldova". Combined with
school autonomy and optimization o f schools networks, this revision will
contribute to improvement o f quality by increasing efficiency, in this way
providing resources for increasing salaries for teachers and increasing o f quality
related expenditures, as didactic materials, equipment and professional trainings.

G.      Health Sector Reform
The health care sector is in the process o f being reformed, the mandatory health
insurance was introduced starting with January 1, 2004. In the first years o f
health insurance, the two lowest income quintiles however have not received the
same benefits as other quintiles due to large share of uninsured people in those
groups. The main goal o f the Government regarding the healthcare sector reform
program, mentioned in EGPRSP, is to increase access of the population, and,
especially, o f the poor, to basic health services through the development of
primary medical care. There is evidence that the health care insurance, which
provides fiee o f charge services on the basis of the Uniform Program has
improvedpopulation's accessto healthservices.

                                         20




 This objective is consistent with the existing disease burden, which largely
 affects the poor and according to international experience prevention measures
 have a very effective impact on health, especially, in case o f poor family.
 Another objective o f health care reform is improve efficiency in the use o f
 financial, human and material resources within the health protection system,
 through a continuous rationalization o f the hospital sector and implementation
 o f mandatory insurances for medical assistance in order to maintain financial
 stability.
 The present health care organization, whereby primary care and hospital services
 are provided by the same legal entities,      allows for subsidizing o f hospital
 services from budgets that are planned for primary health services, thereby
 weakening the primary health services and concealing inefficiencies in the
 hospital sector.
 Inorder to resolve these gaps, the Governmentwill take measures that will allow
 direct contracting o f primary health centers. The Government will preserve at
 least 30% o f allocation for primary health assistance from the budget o f health
 insurances andwill draft a strategy aimed to broadenthe span o fhealth insurance
 coverage. The health insurance company will directly contract at least 5% o f
 primary assistance providers and, following the implementation o f the strategy
 for insurance coverage, health insurance will include 85% o f the residential
population.

H.PublicProcurement

Creation and maintenance of an efficient system of public procurement can help
secure substantial savings o f public expenditures. For these feasons, since 1
January 2005, was initiated the decentralization o f the system o f public
procurement, which clearly delineated attributions and responsibilities in the
process o f public procurement o f goods, works and services for public money.
This measure led to increasing o f transparency in the process o f public
procurement, through posting announcements, publishing relevant information,
results,   reports, template documents, projects etc, both in the Public
Procurements Newsletter, as well as on the web.

There were also held meetings with potential providers, were granted necessary
methodological support to specialists involved in public acquisitions, was
published the Guide for Public Procurements (a manual containing all
instructions, including standard documentation that i s necessary to initiate and
perform procedures o f public procurement). Control over the procedure o f one
source procurement was made tighter. The Regulation on the List o f forbidden
providers (entrepreneurs) participating in the process o f public procurement was
approved by Decision o f the Government, which provides method o f setting up

                                         21


 and monitoring the list o f forbidden providers who do not honor their contractual
 commitments, with an eventual exclusion of those from public procurement
 procedures for a certain period oftime.

 In order to adjust the legal framework regulating public procurement, the
 Government, drafted the new Law on public procurement, which envisaged
 establishment   of an Independent        Agency    for Procurement,    with the
 corresponding staff and budget, in accordance with central public administration
 reform. The draft o f the respective law will be submitted to the Parliament for
 examination and approval by the end o f this year. To facilitate eventual
 implementation o f the newly adopted law, it is planned to draft a plan o f action
 for law execution.

 111. Strengtheningsocial protection systems

A. Completing the pension reform

The pension system started to face common problems to Central and Eastern
European countries during the 1990s. The revenues from contributions
diminished as a result of low tax compliance and the decrease in the number o f
working people. Moreover, the fragmented pension legislation which comprises
numerous pension facilities violates the principle o f "social equity" and
undermines people confidence inthe pension system.

The 1999 Reform of the pension system accomplished its set-out medium term
objectives: timely payment o f pensions in conditions of limited budgetary
transfers. Despitethis, however, the pension reform stays to be incomplete, while
the pension law has not yet been hlly implemented. Although the Law on 1999
reform provides that pension payments be made based on actual contributions
that are paid, and not based on salaries declared, the National House for Social
Insurance has been substantially lagging behind with the introduction o f data on
contributions.

The Government took measures so that 100% o f the declarations made by
insured persons inthe year 2005 and presented by 1 April 2006, was included in
the state Register for individual evidence by June 1 2006. The Government is
committedto keeping the contributiondatabase up-to-date.

Participation in the system o f social insurance by persons employed in the
agricultural sector remains to be a problem, as the means accumulated from their
contribution payments do not cover even a third of expenditures necessary for
pension payments. At present, employees of the agricultural sector contribute
with around 6% o fthe BSSI (the budget of state social insurances) revenues, but
benefit from 53% of it. It is proposed to solve this situation through the

                                           22


 implementation o f the Strategy on reforming the pension system for persons
 employed inthe agricultural sector, and also innon-wage sector (self-employed),
 which provides for switching to the principle of paying income contributions in
 fixed sums, with possible subvention by the state. The respective strategy is
 already drafted and is now being coordinated with the relevant institutions.

 Inorder to continue reform inthe pension sector, the Governmentplansto draft a
 strategy aimed to unify the pensions systems for all categories o f retired persons
 (non-farmers, farmers and privileged persons), and also to amend the pension
 Law, so as to allow for payments based on individual social insurance
 contributions.

 B. Increasing the distribution efficiency in the system o f social assistance
 benefits
 The results o f social assistance programs evidence a rather high level of
 inefficiency, especially due to the fact that resources have not been allocated
 correspondingly. The main objectives for social assistance focus on ensuring
 optimization o f the social payments system, by targeting them towards the most
 poor and focusing on social groups facing situations of risk and the successful
 transition from a categorical to a means-tested system.
 The EGPRS also includes, as a base element, measures aimed to increase
 efficiency in the social assistance system, targeted towards the most vulnerable
population. To this aim, the Government has already approved the Concept for
 increasing efficiency in the social assistance system, by pointing out a series o f
conceptual items, such as the Plan o f actions for increasing efficiency and
method o f payment o f nominal compensations. Based on these, the pilot project
for testing the mechanism for payment o f nominal compensation was launched,
which will include testing o f revenues from families o f nominal compensation
beneficiaries, which will serve as basis for switching to a system where social
assistance (first o f all, nominal compensations) will no longer be given by
categories, but depending on the necessity and total revenues o f the
fmily/person.

Inthe same time, the Government will adopt an additional plano factions aimed
to implement the reform o f the social assistance system, which will include
concrete measures for updating the legal and normative framework, as well as
for the creation o f a single individual account for paying all social payments. The
Government is committed to develop a plan that establishes a timeline for social
assistancereform inorder to introduce improved targeting for poor, which would
ensure the transition from a categorical to a means-tested system and the
implementation o fthis time-bound actionplan.

Maintenance o f registers in an unsatisfactory manner, the insufficient
dissemination o f information among various programs of social assistance, as

                                         23


well as management o f the social assistance program by several governmental
agencies make it difficult for the Government to evaluate the general impact and
the efficiency o f the social assistance program. In this context, the Government
will draft and implement an information system aimed to ensure better
maintenance ofregisters andto disseminate information more widely.

Finally, let me assure you that my Government i s determined and committed to
continue with the necessary actions and reform to improve the performance in
priority areas such as improve governance, infrastructure, education and social
service and give a new impetus to private sector development aiming to deliver a
higher quality o f service to Moldavian citizens, ensuring a sustained growth
perspective for the country. Iam sure that my country can rely on the continuous
support of the World Bank and yours personally,

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE



     IMF Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of
                                          Moldova


On May 5, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultationwith the Republic of Moldova.'

Background

Economic growth has continued to be robust, although the drivers of growth-household
consumption and construction-remain heavily dependent on inflows of remittances (now
equal to some 30 percent of GDP), as well as strong wage growth. Real GDP growth in
2005 was over 7 percent, as it has been since early in the decade. Inflation has gradually
abated. After peaking at over 14 percent in April 2005, it fell to 10 percent (year-on-year) in
December, despite a sharp pickup in energy prices in mid-2005.

Fiscal policy has remained tight. The general government posted a cash surplus of about
1.7 percent of GDP in 2005, about twice the level of 2004, and considerably tighter than the
deficit predicted in the revised 2005 budget (% percent of GDP). The main factors driving
this fiscal performancewere better-than-expectedValue Added Tax revenues, delays in
implementingforeign-financed project investments, disbursement of a grant from the
European Union on December 29 for which expenditures had been included in the 2006
budget, and some spending restraint on the part of the government.


  Under Article IV of the IMF'sArticles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters,the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing
Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the
Executive Board as expressed during the Executive Board discussion based on the staff
report.

                                               1

ANNEX 3: FUNDRELATIONSNOTE                                                       Page2 o f4

Monetary policy was tightened in 2005, despite continued strong inflows of remittances.
Sterilization efforts were stepped up in the second and third quarters before easing in the
fourth quarter, as the balance of payments weakened in light of higher energy prices and
the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) moderated its foreign exchange purchases. The
NBM's balance on sterilization operations rose from an average of 1.Ipercent of GDP in
2004 to an average of 2.9 in 2005, reaching 3.5 percent of GDP at end-February 2006. As a
result, reserve money growth slowed during the year, falling to 16% percent at end-
September, before rising seasonally in December.At the same time, broad money growth
remained strong (at 35 percentfor the year as a whole). Lending and deposit rates have
remained high, despite plentiful liquidity on the
T-bill and interbank markets. Financial sector soundness indicators have remained
generally strong, reflecting partly strong economic performance of the recent years.

Moldova appears to follow an asymmetric, managed floating exchange rate regime. Since
early 2004, it would appear that downward pressure is accommodated while upward
pressure is absorbed by the NBM through purchases of foreign exchange. The leu
appreciated in real effective terms in 2004, but with a weaker balance of payments and
lower inflation than in key trading partners, this tendency leveled off in 2005. Reserves have
grown as well, doubling in dollar terms since end-2003, though as a share of imports they
remain modest at about 2.2 months.

The trade balance deteriorated significantly in 2005, owing in large part to the impact of
higher energy prices. Energy (particularly fuel oil) imports rose in value terms by about 50
percent in 2005 (to about 5 percent of GDP), while export growth slowed modestly. The
structural reform agenda has been reinvigorated by Moldova's aspirations for closer
integration with Europe. The European Union-Moldova Action Plan, signed in February
2005, provides, along with the authorities' Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (EGPRSP), a road map for advancing a broad reform agenda, including in
areas public administration, public expenditure management, and management of state
enterprises.


Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directorswelcomed the strong economic growth and significant poverty reduction
in recent years, the moderation of inflation, and the strengthened fiscal position, and
commended Moldova'sauthorities for their commitment to structural reforms and balanced
macroeconomicpolicies.At the same time, they noted that growth has been fueled mainly
by domestic spending, which was financed by workers' remittances. Directors agreed that
maintainingmacroeconomicstability in light of robust inflows of remittances while
diversifyingthe economy and bringing povertyfurther down remain the key challenges
going forward. They also stressed the importance of improvingthe business environment to
support greater private sector investment and thus to help reverse the large migration of
labor and strengthen the external position.

Directors commended the authorities for their disciplined macroeconomic policies and
considered that the short-termfiscal stance constituted an appropriate balance between the
objective of supportingdisinflation and meeting the need for larger public investment and

                                                2

social spending. Looking ahead, most Directors encouraged the authorities to repeat the
fiscal over performance of recent years, though some Directors favored devoting revenue in
excess of budgeted amounts to poverty reduction and infrastructure spending if the
macroeconomicenvironment permits it.

Directorswelcomed the authorities' efforts to modernize public sector management to
improvethe efficiency of government operations. They observed given the large size of the
government, that the public administration reform currently underway should lead to a
leaner, more focused, and transparent government structure. While Directors welcomed the
decision to fully pass through energy price changes, they expressed concern about the
large increases in public sector wages in 2006 and urged the authorities to ensure that the
wage profile remains consistent with priorities identified in the mediurn-term expenditure
framework.

Directorswelcomed the decline in inflation during 2005. Nevertheless, they noted that
inflationarypressures remain, particularly in light of the increasing energy prices and the
tightening labor market, and urged the authorities to be prepared to tighten monetary policy.
Directors also encouraged the authorities to permit greater exchange rate flexibility to
minimize risks to the disinflation path and facilitate the economy's resilience to balance-of-
payments shocks. In this context, they welcomed the authorities' decision to amend the
National Bank law to establish price stability as its key objective and stressed that this
legislative change needs to be matched by steps in monetary policy implementation.

Directorswelcomed the authorities' renewed push for structural reforms and underscored
their importance to sustain the economic revival and maintain external competitiveness.
They stressed the importance to improvethe environment for private initiative and
investment also by reducing licensing and registration requirements and other
administrative barriers and strengthen the legal and institutional framework and
governance.They encouraged the authorities to accelerate implementation of the structural
policies envisaged in their Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EGPRSP) to
encourage investment, reverse the current emigration trend, and use the strategy to make
progress in achieving the MDGs. Directorsalso noted that the EU-Moldova Action Plan-
which is consistent with the EGPRSP-will serve as a useful roadmap for the ambitious
reform agenda.

Directors noted that financial sector stability indicators were largely positive, but urged the
authoritiesto address remaining vulnerabilities. They emphasized the crucial importance of
financial sector development to underpin economic and employment growth. Directors
considered that Moldova's financial sector, and the economy more broadly, would benefit
from a presence of reputable international banking institutions. In this context, they
welcomed the authorities' intention to privatize Banca de Economii. Directors also
commendedthe authorities for strengtheningthe AMLEFT framework and their objective of
bringing it in line with best practices over the medium term.

Directors welcomed the sustained improvement in Moldova's external debt position and
expressed hope that Moldova will be able to normalize its relations with Paris Club creditors
and restructure its stock of arrears in the near future, underscoring that this would facilitate
access to fresh donor financial support.

Directors were encouraged by Moldova's subscription to the Fund's Special Data
Dissemination Standard as an important step to further improve transparency, timeliness,
and comprehensivenessof economic and financial data.
