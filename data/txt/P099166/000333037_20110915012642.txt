F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
Poverty Reduction Support Credit One (PRSC 1) for the Republic of Moldova
  follows an intensification of the Government#s reform efforts over the past several
years and is intended to bolster and deepen those efforts. More specifically, the proposed
credit aims to enhance the Government#s ability to accelerate economic growth and
improve the efficiency o f i t s social programs and public administration - key elements
in poverty reduction. To this end, the proposed PRSC will support selective areas o f the
Government#s reform agenda, as outlined in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) and the European Union (EU)-Moldova action plan, thereby complementing and
reinforcing other Bank Group programs in Moldova, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF)-supported Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) and other donor activities.
Closely aligned with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the PRSC will support the
EGPRSP objectives of:

  Improving the Investment Climate. Moldova i s entering a new phase in its economic
development where consumption driven growth - based on the export o f labor and inflow
o f remittances - can no longer be expected to sustain current growth rates over the
medium-term. Sustaining and accelerating future growth and poverty reduction in
Moldova will depend on increases in domestic productivity which, in turn , will depend
on the extent to which firms and farms address current l o w levels o f investment and
innovation. The Government#s agenda focuses on further improving the investment
climate for private sector development. These efforts will also directly contribute to
Government efforts to improve governance and reduce corruption. Key to Moldova#s
efforts to accelerate economic growth and poverty reduction will be improving the
performance o f the agriculture sector. Similarly, reducing destabilizing economic
impacts o f external energy price shocks w i l l require improvements in energy
efficiency.

  Improving the Efficiency and Management of Public Resources. Better governance and
public institutions are central to growth and poverty reduction. The EGPRSP is conscious
of the constraint imposed by the insufficient functional and institutional adaptation of the
public administration to the requirements set by the transition from a centrally planned
economy to a market economy. The EGPRSP recognizes that establishing a modern and
efficient public administration i s necessary in order to achieve the country#s longer-term
development outcomes. Increased public investment spending,
  particularly in public infrastructure, will be needed in order to support Moldova#s
private sector-led growth. This will require enhancing the strategic allocation o f public
resources by improving the (Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) process,
public procurement practices and including better public investment management.
Reforms in a number of key sectoral areas can also improve the efficiency o f public
resource use, yielding increased fiscal space for more public investment spending without
crowding
  out the private sector.




                                             v
  Strengthening Pension and Social Assistance Systems. While the recent slowdown in
poverty reduction highlights the need to improve the quality o f growth in Moldova, it
also points to the need to strengthen existing social safety nets. The Government#s
program to improve delivery o f utility, infrastructure and social services is reflected in
the EGPRSP. The PRSC would strengthen the effectiveness and future fiscal viability of
the pay-as-you-go pension program by supporting efforts to complete the 1999 pension
reform, including efforts to unify the pension system for all types o f pensioners.
  Improving targeting efficiency of social assistance programs and gaining efficiency in
program administration will be a necessary element o f Moldova#s poverty reduction
efforts.

  PRSC 2, the second in a set of three annual PRSCs, support the Government#s reform
efforts as articulated in their PRSP (or National Development Strategy NDS as it is
known in Moldova) and the EU-Moldova Action Plan. The Second Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC2) for the Republic of Moldova is intended to bolster and deepen
the reform efforts supported by the first PRSC (PRSC1). The proposed credit aims to
support Government's efforts to accelerate shared economic growth and improve
governance by addressing the efficiency of its expenditure programs and public
administration - key elements in poverty reduction. To this end, the proposed PRSC2 will
continue to support selective areas of the Government's reform agenda, as outlined in the
National Development Plan (NDS) # the successor to the Economic Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP) - and the European Union (EU)-Moldova action
plan. The proposed PRSC2 also complements and reinforces other Bank Group programs
in Moldova, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)-supported Poverty Reduction
Growth Facility (PRGF) and other donor activities. The PRSC2 will support the
Government#s objectives of:

  # Improving the Investment Climate: The Government#s reform agenda focuses on
further improving the investment climate for private sector development. These efforts
will also directly contribute to Government efforts to improve governance and reduce
corruption. An important element of Moldova#s efforts to accelerate economic growth
and poverty reduction will be improving the performance of the agriculture sector.
Similarly, reducing destabilizing economic impacts of external energy price shocks will
require improvements in energy efficiency.

  # Improving the Efficiency and Management of Public Resources: Advancing reforms
that establish a modern and efficient public administration is necessary in order to
achieve the country#s longer-term development outcomes. Increased public investment
spending, particularly in public infrastructure, will be needed in order to support
Moldova#s private-sector led growth. This will require enhancing the strategic allocation
of public resources by improving the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)
process, public procurement practices and including better public investment
management. Reforms in a number of key sectoral areas can also improve the efficiency
of public resource use, allowing for spending reallocation towards public investment.

  # Strengthening Pension and Social Assistance Systems. The second PRSC would
support the Government#s efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and future fiscal
viability of the pay-as-you-go pension program by supporting efforts to complete the
1999 pension reform, including efforts to unify the pension system for all types of
pensioners. With higher energy and food prices likely to persist for some time to come,
improving targeting efficiency of social assistance programs and gaining efficiency in
program administration will be necessary elements of Moldova#s poverty reduction
efforts.

   1. PROGRAM CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1.    CONTEXT AT APPRAISAL

Political Background

Moldova’s transition to a market economy was very difficult, following the deep recession in the
aftermath of the Soviet Union dissolution, and the separation of the Transnistria region – the
country’s industrial base, at the beginning of the 90’s. As with many of the post-Soviet
economies, independence brought an end to the system of subsidies and transfers from which
Moldova benefitted. A second severe economic downturn hit Moldova in 1998-1999 as a result of
the regional financial crisis provoked by Russia’s default on government debt instruments. By
1999, nearly 70 percent of Moldovans were poor by international standards (i.e. based on
international poverty line of $2.15 PPP per day), of which around 60 percent were extremely
poor. Moldova’s social indicators, a measure of non-income dimensions of poverty, were also
considered among the worst in the region.

During the 1990s, international donor intervention (including the World Bank’s Structural
Adjustment Credits (SACs) and the IMF’s Systemic Transformation Facility, the Compensatory
and Contingency Financing Facility, and two Stand-By Arrangements) designed to support
Moldova’s transition to market economy, achieved modest success. The fragile political
consensus backing the pro-reform government led to slow and unsatisfactory outcomes of
structural reforms. The impoverished population became less enthusiastic about ideological
change and brought to power the Communist Party (CP) in 2001. To fulfill some of its electoral
promises, the CP followed a more dirigiste approach, creating barriers for business and reversing
some accomplishments of the past reform programs. It also showed little interest in implementing
the structural reforms advised by development partners. These created a difficult environment for
policy dialogue both internally and with the donor community, and led to the suspension of both
the IMF program and IDA’s SAC 3. With increasing risks of isolation from the international
community, the CP changed position in 2005 – just before the commencement of a second term
in government, and embraced a pro-European stance and sought closer collaboration with
development partners. This provided a re-entry point for the Bank into the policy reform agenda.


Economic Background

Moldova was the last country in the CIS to see a return to positive growth. After falling by more
than 60 percent between independence (in 1991) and 1999, cumulative growth of more than 40
percent was recorded between 2000 and 2005 - with average real growth of around 7 percent per
annum. The major engine of growth in Moldova has been domestic household consumption and
construction fueled by massive inflows of workers’ remittances – officially recorded at nearly 31
percent of GDP in 2008. In addition, migration and the inflow of remittances also contributed to
increases in the real wage as well as the reservation wage of workers. Moldova was one of the
most indebted countries in the region. However, rapid economic growth, together with net
repayment to creditors and favorable rescheduling operations resulted in a rapid decline in the
ratio of total external debt to GDP – from 106 percent of GDP in 2001 to around 55 percent in
2005. The remittances-financed economic recovery preceding the PRSC series, together with
increased government transfers to the population, led to a rapid decline in poverty – between
1999 and 2003, over 37 percent of the population moved out of poverty in Moldova, marking the


                                               3
largest absolute decline in poverty in Europe and Central Asia over this period.

However, despite the good economic performance, the country remained vulnerable to internal
and external shocks. Firstly, in late March 2006, Russia’s consumer protection agency
announced a ban on imports of wine from Moldova. As wine represents 30 percent of Moldovan
exports, of which about 80 percent (or 10 percent of GDP) traditionally went to Russia, the ban
had a significant negative impact on the economy. Secondly, import prices of fuel and natural
gas increased by over 40 percent in 2005 and 38 percent in early 2006, respectively. Given
Moldova’s complete dependence on imported energy, these fuel price hikes put inflationary
pressures on the economy and reduced purchasing power.


Other developments prior to appraisal of the first PRSC.

To focus reform efforts, the government developed the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (EGPRSP) – the first full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) prepared by
the Moldovan authorities after broad-based consultations (supervised by a Participation Council)
with stakeholders and civil society. The EGPRSP, presented to the Boards of IDA and IMF in
November 2004, set three medium-term objectives: (i) sustainable and inclusive economic
growth; (ii) reduction of poverty and inequality and increased participation of the poor in
economic development; and (iii) human resource development. To achieve these objectives, the
EGPRSP advocated a three-pillar strategy: (i) promotion of sustainable and inclusive economic
growth; (ii) improved human development; and (iii) strengthened social protection of the most
vulnerable groups. In addition, the government’s EU aspirations culminated in the adoption of an
EU-Moldova Action Plan in May 2005. The Plan covered a wide range of issues, including
democratization, health standards, legal reform, and economics. In the economics area, it is
consistent with the EGPRSP and includes macroeconomic stability and poverty reduction,
improving the investment climate, and trade promotion.


1.2.  ORIGINAL PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES (PDO) AND KEY
INDICATORS

Program Development Objectives (PDOs). The overall objective of the PRSC was to support
the Government’s economic growth and poverty reduction strategy through selective support to
the three development objectives (or pillars) outlined as follows (i) improving the investment
climate, (ii) Improving the efficiency and management of public resources, (iii) strengthening
pension and social assistance systems.
          
The specific measures associated with each of these pillars are described in sections 2.1 and 3.2
below (expected outcomes are presented in Annex 1). The original PDOs within these three
pillars and the associated key indicators were not revised throughout the PRSC series.



1.3.    ORIGINAL POLICY AREAS SUPPORTED BY PROGRAM

The PRSC series focused on three policy areas, in support of the government’s reform program:

  i.    Improving the Investment Climate. This first pillar recognized that the existing
        consumption-led, remittances-driven growth was not sustainable, and that future growth


                                                4
        and poverty reduction in Moldova would depend on key policy actions to improve the
        investment climate and foster a more competitive enterprise and farming sector that will
        ultimately increase domestic productivity. Achieving faster productivity growth, as well
        as employment generation, was closely linked to the extent firms and farms addressed
        low levels of investment and innovation, especially in the agriculture sector. Similarly,
        reducing the destabilizing economic impacts of external price shocks was associated with
        improvements in energy efficiency and cost recovery of tariffs.

  ii.   Improving the efficiency and management of public resources. This second pillar
        supported reforms that addressed weaknesses in the public sector, by helping the
        government build a meritocratic civil service, improve the strategic allocation of public
        finances (with an enhanced focus on pro-growth investment spending on physical and
        human capital), and increase competition in public procurement. Establishing a modern
        and efficient public administration was necessary in order to achieve the country’s
        longer-term development outcomes. Increased public investment spending, particularly in
        public infrastructure, was needed in order to support Moldova’s private-sector led
        growth. This required enhancing the strategic allocation of public resources by improving
        the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) process, public procurement practices,
        and public investment management.

 iii.   Strengthening Pension and Social Assistance Systems. The third pillar focused on
        pension and social assistance systems (including better targeting of vulnerable groups) to
        mitigate the slowdown in poverty reduction. The PRSC series aimed to support the
        Government’s reform efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and future fiscal viability of
        the pay-as-you-go pension program by supporting efforts to complete the 1999 pension
        reform, including efforts to unify the pension system for all types of pensioners.
        Improving targeting efficiency of social assistance programs and increasing efficiency in
        program administration was seen as a necessary element of Moldova’s poverty reduction
        efforts.

These three pillars promoted policy reform previously initiated under the high-case triggers in the
2004 CAS and were aligned with key elements of the reform agenda articulated in the
Government’s first and second PRSPs (the EGPRSP and the National development Strategy,
NDS) and the EU-Moldova Action Plan. The PRSC program was also designed to harmonize
multi-donor policy actions and budget support, in line with the Development Partnership
Framework signed between the government of Moldova, IDA, the Netherlands, UK DFID,
Sweden SIDA, the UN, IMF, and the EU in May 2006. Table 1 illustrates the broad consistency
between the NDS, the EGPRSP, EU-Moldova Action plan and the PRSC program.

   2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1.    PROGRAM PERFORMANCE

Table 2 below lists the prior actions or “triggers?, as specified in the associated financing or
credit agreements that were taken by the government as the basis for the approval of each of the
two credits in the series. Compliance with triggers (or prior actions) in PRSC 1 was verified at
the time of Board approval and remains in place. Revisions were made to five of seven PRSC 2
triggers (as originally stated in PRSC 1) to accommodate changes in the government’s
implementation schedule and the scope of reform. At the time of revision (appraisal of PRSC 2),
none of the changes were expected to affect the original outcomes and targets.

Specifically, the revisions include: (i) the measures to reduce regulatory and administrative costs
of business regulations were revised because the Parliament broadened this reform effort and
required more time for approval and promulgation; (ii) the measure on building a meritocratic
Civil Service was revised from “the adoption of the new CS Law?, to “government’s approval
and submission to Parliament the draft Civil Service Law?, since the process of parliamentary
approval and promulgation had taken longer than expected; (iii) the preparation of the strategy for
transport infrastructure management and financing was extended to government’s adoption of
that strategy because the government approved the strategy ahead of schedule and the budget for
road maintenance had been substantially increased; (iv) the measure on education spending which
centered on the adoption of a strategy to optimize school networks, was modified to the
“drafting? of the strategy, to allow time for broad consultations necessary for developing
consensus behind the reform effort; and finally, (v) the completion of the pension reform program
through amendments to the Pension Law was revised to the government’s adoption and
submission of draft amendments to the Parliament, given delays in the parliamentary approval.

                                                               7
The third and final operation in the series (PRSC 3) scheduled for 2009 was aborted for the
following reasons: (a) the IMF PRGF program (covering 2006 – 2008), which was a pre-requisite
for the PRSC program, went off-track as the global economic crisis hit Moldova, in part, because
fiscal adjustments necessary to keep the program on-track proved unpopular (in view of
upcoming elections) and could not be politically supported; (b) a new Government came to power
in September 2009 with new policy priorities to address the economic crisis and stimulate
recovery; and (c) implementation of PRSC3 prior actions by the outgoing Government was
slower than expected – several triggers had not been met. Consequently, a single-tranche USD 25
million Development Policy Operation (DPO) was put in place (approved by the Bank’s board in
June 2010), to reflect the changed economic and political realities of Moldova. Noteworthy to
mention, however, that the spirit of PRSC 3 reform agenda was maintained under the DPO in key
areas like agriculture, energy, and social protection. The main difference is that the DPO dropped
the longer-term agenda of public sector reform in favor of measures to stimulate private sector-
led recovery.

2.2.    MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION

The implementation of the program of policy and institutional reforms supported by the  PRSC 
series benefitted from these factors:
   i.   The strong and constructive relationship between the Moldovan government and the
        World Bank created a solid basis for policy engagement. The Bank’s support via the
        SACs helped the Moldovan authorities address difficult economic episodes. As a result,
        the Bank – as an international development institution now enjoyed substantial credibility
        and goodwill in Moldova.

  ii.   In response to previous implementation experience in the SACs program, the government
        made key institutional changes, including the creation of (a) an inter-ministerial
        committee headed by the First Deputy Prime Minister (who later became the Prime
        Minister) to coordinate the PRSC program. This committee remained in place for PRSC 1
        and 2; and (b) a new division – the Department for Policies, Strategic Planning, and
        Foreign Aid, under the State Chancellery to facilitate monitoring and implementation of
        prior actions in all donor programs.

 iii.   In parallel with the PRSCs, the Bank and donor partners provided resources and technical
        assistance for the implementation of the PRSC reform agenda including the multi-donor
        trust fund (MDTF) for public administration and civil service reform, and PHRD grants
        that financed consultants to do technical assistance, analytical work, and monitoring and
        evaluation associated with the PRSC-supported reforms. Effective coordination among
        donors also helped optimize the government’s limited capacity.

However, implementation was adversely affected by the government’s inability to maintain its
commitment by garnering enough support in the Parliament (and the Presidency) to move
forward in certain areas of the PRSC reform agenda. This occurred for a number of reasons: (a)
there were too many policy actions and the government’s implementation capacity was
overwhelmed trying to move the agenda forward; (b) a number of prior actions (e.g. education
reform) were driven by the Bank’s analytical work and were too extensive and/or not in tandem
with the priority reform areas of line ministries and/or the political economy, even though the
series was closely-linked to broad national objectives as set out in the EGPRSP and the NDS; and
(c) some business groups and unions expanded their influence on the government (including in




                                                8
the parliament) and were able to use this influence to protect vested interests in certain areas like
agriculture.

2.3. MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E) DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION
AND UTILIZATION

The set of benchmarks and monitoring indicators initially set out in Annex II of PRSC I (and
included in Annex 1 in this document) were drawn from the government’s overall development
program – the EGPRSP. These indicators were maintained throughout the series. The
government’s inter-ministerial steering committee, consisting representatives of line ministries,
was responsible for gathering evidence on all benchmark and outcome indicators for the PRSC,
the EGPRSP, the Moldova-EU Action Plan, and the MTEF. This committee was assisted by a
PHRD-funded technical committee. While the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) and the
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) supplied information of macroeconomic performance, the
annual report on the EGPRSP produced by the government served as a key instrument for
monitoring PRSC progress given closely aligned targets.

The M&E conducted during the PRSC series fed back into the program design in two areas: (i)
scaling back the timetable (and scope) of a number of policy actions, as discussed in Section 2.1;
and (ii) broadening the scope of reform in transportation infrastructure management and the
investment climate. On the other hand, M&E was less informative of program outcomes. Targets
and indicated outcomes should have been revised alongside the policy matrix, in line with the
realities of program implementation.



2.4.    EXPECTED NEXT PHASE/FOLLOW-UP OPERATION

The single-tranche DPO of USD 25 million approved by the Bank’s Board of executive directors
in June 2010 supported the new government’s “Economic Stabilization and Recovery Plan
(ESRP) for 2009 – 2011?. The Plan included measures aimed to (a) cut inefficient and low-
priority public spending; (b) help businesses to withstand the economic slow-down and emerge
less-burdened by public administrative requirements; and (c) protect vulnerable households from
a drop in consumption due to the recession and fiscal contraction. Specifically, the DPO prior
actions were aligned with (b) and (c), consolidating the reform gains of the PRSC series in
improving the investment climate, energy reform, road maintenance, redirection of agricultural
subsidies towards investment, and better targeted social assistance,

Parliamentary Elections were held in November 2010, but no single party won enough seats to
form the government. The new Parliament approved a three-party pro-Europe coalition
government very similar to the previous government in January 2011. However, the new coalition
controls 59 votes in Parliament, two short of the minimum needed to elect a new president; hence
the constitutional crisis that has rocked Moldova over the last two years remains unresolved.
While the formation of a new government allows the Bank to resume formal dialogue on the
overall development agenda, engagement on long-term policy priorities is made difficult by the
current political logjam.




                                                 9
   3.   ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1.    RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

The overall reform program supported by the PRSC series was relevant to the development
challenges facing Moldova during this period, and remains relevant. The PRSC appropriately
focused on economic growth via improving the investment climate and improving the efficiency
of social assistance and public administration – all key elements in the reduction of rural and
urban poverty. The PRSC program was closely aligned with the 2004 EGPRSP and the NDS of
2007. The close link between the PRSCs’ policy actions and those of the recently-approved DPO
is further evidence of the continued relevance of PRSC objectives. Even retrospectively, the
broad agenda of the PRSCs is supportive of the three Pillars of the Bank’s Country Partnership
Strategy for 2009 to 2012.

On operation design, the choice of the PRSC instrument was appropriate in the Moldovan context
at the time of approval. It provided much needed balance to the Bank’s engagement given the
unfinished policy reform agenda of the SACs program, the need for flexibility due to the
government’s implementation track record, and the need to leverage donor resources effectively.
The balancing of the PRSCs and other bank/donor operations (including investment lending) was
notable, and collaboration and coordination with donors like DFID, SIDA, PHRD, and the EU
was laudable. In many areas such as, reducing energy vulnerability, improving public financial
management system, roads maintenance, and public procurement, the PRSCs provided support
for policy changes and capacity building, whilst Bank or donor-funded investment operations
provided financing for infrastructure and technical assistance. Finally, in portfolio terms, the
amounts of IDA resources committed to the PRSCs (under 20 percent of total CAS lending)
seems sufficient to incentivize the government on policy reform, but not so large as to crowd out
investment lending and other operations.

However, some elements in the PRSCs policy matrix were driven by the Bank’s diagnostics of
the binding constraints to growth and development in Moldova and the political economy was
given insufficient consideration. The choice of indicators was, for the most part, reasonable, but
there were instances when monitoring indicators and expected outcomes were difficult to
measure, and were unrealistic. In several cases (e.g. PRSC 2 triggers), Bank staff responded with
commendable flexibility to the political constraints that slowed-down policy reform by formally
delaying the implementation schedule. Unfortunately, this meant that in certain areas, the aborted
PRSC 3 operation carried the bulk of reform steps to achieve targets and indicated outcomes that
remained unchanged throughout the series. Overall, the PRSC program is relevant.


3.2.    ACHIEVEMENT OF PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES

Between 2006 and 2008, the macroeconomic framework was consistent with the core objectives
of the PRSC series. The government maintained fiscal balance with a modest deficit – 1% of
GDP by the end of 2008 (period average of 0.5% GDP). However, budget performance was
driven more by buoyant revenues (on the back of robust VAT on remittances-funded imports)
rather than by expenditure restraint. Real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 5.2% - higher
than the minimum 4% target of the Program, in spite of significant external shocks i.e. higher
energy prices and the Russian ban on Moldova’s main exports in 2006, and the unprecedented
drought in the summer of 2007. Inflation rose initially on the back of higher energy prices – to
14.1% in 2007, above the Program’s target of 10.5%, but fell within single-digit territory as
energy prices fell – 7.3% by the end of 2008 as envisaged by the program. Public and Publicly-


                                               10
Guaranteed external debt to GDP fell to sustainable levels – from 26.4% in 2005 to 15.7% by the
end of 2008. After the program closed, the economy contracted by 6.5% in 2009 due to the
drastic fall in consumption, investment expenditure, and remittances as a result of the global
economic crisis; and inflation fell to zero percent. The expectation for 2010 was a rebound in
remittances and return to positive growth of about 2.5 percent.


Pillar I: Improving the Investment Climate

    A. Reducing Regulatory and Administrative Costs of Business Regulations.

The PRSC program supported a comprehensive review (and subsequent withdrawal) of executive
regulations that affect foreign investment and the competitiveness of Moldovan firms, and
included the introduction of the Law on Basic Principles and Mechanisms of State Regulation of
Business Activity (also known as “Guillotine?), which amended over 80 Laws covering business
entry, exit, licensing, and operations. This Law came into effect in 2008. Furthermore, Regulatory
Impact Assessment (RIA) has become mandatory for all new regulations affecting business –
RIA units were created in government ministries and agencies to implement this. As a result of
these actions, the percentage of management time spent complying with the government’s
regulatory requirements has reduced from 17% in 2005 to 13.8% in 2008, and 11.2% in 2009
(according to the CODB survey). Average firm licensing and authorization costs also fell below
the program’s target of 30% of per capita GDP, to 18.9% by the end of 2008, and to 13.3% by the
end of 2009. A new draft Law on Competition Protection under preparation by the government
will assure the sustainability and deepening of these efforts. Therefore, the expected
developmental outcomes have been achieved.

    B. Improving Trade Facilitation. 

The reforms envisioned under the PRSC to reduce inefficiency at the Moldovan Customs Service
(MCS) and costs of cross-border trade, have been completed through (i) aligning legislation and
regulations to EU standards, (ii) the implementation of risk-based (ASYCUDA) selectivity, and,
(iii) the establishment of a system of customs border and clearance performance indicators.
However, while significant improvements have been made, development outcomes expected
under the PRSC have not been achieved. As at December 2008, the proportions of physical
inspections for exports and imports were 29.31% and 32.08% respectively, slightly short of the
30% target. The average customs clearance time for exports and imports 46.61 minutes and 62
minutes respectively, also fell short of the 30 minute target.

    C. Developing Agricultural Markets. 

As envisaged by the PRSC program, the gaps between farmgate prices and international parity
prices were reduced through the elimination of the requirement that commodities (particularly
cereals) pass through the de facto monopsony – the United Commodities Exchange, and the
dissemination of information on international prices of cereals and oilseeds in the local media.
The target 25% reduction in the gap between farmgate and international prices, relative to 2005,
were attained for wheat and maize but not for sunflower seed (as at December 2008). Producer
prices for sunflower remain severely depressed, due to the strong lobbying power of the
monopolistic processing industry that limits export opportunities for individual farmers. In
addition, the government occasionally banned exports of agricultural products during the PRSC
period, depressing local prices. Therefore, the expected outcome is partially achieved.



                                               11
The implementation of the Action Plan for developing agricultural markets – which included (i)
the development of a Market Information System, (ii) the liberalization of the import regime for
seed and seedlings, and (iii) accelerated test periods for annual and perennial crops in the EU
common catalogue to 1 year and 4 years respectively – yielded the desired results. Domestic and
international grain price information are now collected and disseminated by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Food Industry (MAFI) and the state rural extension service, as well as by other
partners (rural NGOs and farm organizations), on a weekly basis. The number of new varieties
registered by the National Board for Plant Varieties grew to 233 in 2008, up from 179 in 2007
and 111 in 2006. Thus, the two-year increase in the number of new varieties has accounted for
110% - much higher than the 25% target increase. The government also adopted and
implemented the Law on Savings and Credit Associations. Therefore, expected outcomes have
been achieved.

Overall, poverty in Moldova decreased, but improvements are restricted to urban areas (see
Section 3.4). Rural agricultural productivity and farm profits declined between 2006 and 2009,
and several thousand rural workers emigrated abroad. Russia’s ban on wine exports in 2006 and
the drought in the summer of 2007 also had significant negative effects on rural income. Hence
the PRSC’s objective of improving rural poverty headcount has not been achieved, although it is
doubtful whether associated policy measures could have single-handedly delivered rural poverty
reduction.

    D. Reducing Energy Vulnerability.

The achievement of energy outcomes is as follows:

    (i)       The objective to increase energy efficiency through a reduction in energy intensity,
              and increase cash collection ratios above 90% for natural gas and 95% for electricity
              have been achieved. Energy intensity, as measured by the ratio of total primary
              energy consumed to real GDP (lei) decreased from 1.80 in 2005, to 1.39 in 2009 – a
              23 percent reduction. Cash collection ratios have also increased: gas – 92.5%, and
              electricity – 98% in 2008.

    (ii)      The objective to ensure that cost recovery of gas, electricity, and heat tariffs for all
              categories of consumers approaches 100% has been achieved. Tariffs were
              increased fully to cost-recovery levels under the PRSC program, except heating
              tariffs in Chisinau which were raised to cost recovery levels in early 2010 under the
              DPO..1

    (iii)     To ensure that the regulatory framework in the electricity market is compatible with
              relevant provisions of the ECSEE Treaty and the EU electricity directives has been
              partially achieved. The government submitted a draft Energy Law to the Parliament
              in December 2008. Upon review, the Bank team noted that the Law did not
              adequately address the issues indicated in the triggers. As a result of the review, the
              draft Law was revised and re-submitted to the Parliament in April 2010, as part of the
              prior actions of the DPO. The new Law was passed by the Parliament, in full
              compliance with the EU Directives on Electricity and Gas (as assessed by EU
              experts). Secondary legislation is expected to be completed under the European

1
 Noteworthy to mention that tariffs are not yet in full compliance with Bank-supported methodology for setting tariffs.
ANRE, the national energy regulator, is committed to full compliance starting January 2011.




                                                         12
            Energy Community Treaty (ECT), of which Moldova became a full member in May
            2010..

    (iv)    To ensure that energy as a share of household expenditures is reported by the
            Household Budget Survey (HBS) has not been achieved. The HBS does not report
            energy specifically as a household expenditure item – it does provide only dwelling
            maintenance data.

 
Pillar II: Improving the Efficiency and Management of Public Sector Resources.

    A. Building a meritocratic civil service.

A new Civil Service (CS) Law promoting open, competitive and merit-based recruitment as the
core of civil service reform was promulgated by the presidency in December 2008 and entered
into force in January 2009; the process of implementation is underway. The regulation on the
procedure for competitive recruitment has been revised (by SIGMA – a program financed by the
European Commission and the OECD) in line with the new law. Though developed, the system
for the classification and grading of civil service posts is not functional yet in the absence of
underlying regulations. Implementation was also delayed on the Bank’s advice - the Bank team
expressed the view that implementation should be delayed until after elections in 2009 should the
new government introduce further reorganizations.

The automated CS Register is not functional as expected but good progress has been made. The
government announced a tender for the development of the application software for the Civil
Service Registry in December 2008. Bids for the CS register itself were opened in August 2010.
Despite the delays in the implementation of the overall program, the development objective of the
PRSC series has been achieved. About 30 percent of new civil servants were appointed through a
competitive, merit-based process in 2007 even in the absence of the Civil Service Law. At
present, all government ministries and agencies publicly advertise vacancies via local media – an
improvement from pre-PRSC era.

    B. Implementing a transparent and uniform remuneration system for civil servants.

The PRSC’s goal of developing a uniform pay system for the civil service has been achieved
even as policy measures have not been fully implemented. As at the end of 2008, base salary as a
percentage of total remuneration was 80% (target of the series is 75-80%) and information on the
public sector pay was centrally available for review and analysis, as envisaged. Work on a new
civil service classification and grading system commenced under PRSC 2, but has not been
finalized and implemented, as the foreseen new Law on civil service remuneration – planned
under PRSC 3---remains under preparation today. In the meantime, public sector wages have
been frozen until 2012 under the IMF program now in place.

    C. Improving the strategic allocation of public resources.

A stronger link between the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and annual budget
laws has been achieved. The government approved the MTEF concept document (2009 – 2011)
containing medium-term policy priorities consistent with the NDS to guide the budget process.
However, no significant progress has been made in the implementation of the Project
Identification Form (PIF) database introduced under PRSC 2, to enable better prioritization,
preparation, and appraisal of public investment projects. There is no evidence to support


                                                13
increased use of the PIF and awareness of economic cost-benefit analysis in the public sector. The
absence of a measureable indicator makes it difficult to assess whether the quality of funded
public-investment projects has improved.


    C.1. Agricultural Spending

The objective of the series was to streamline government support for the agricultural sector
through the elimination of debt write-offs, the reduction in recurrent subsidies especially to large
farms, and an increase in peasant farmers’ share of subsidies. This objective has been partially
achieved. While there are no new debt write-offs, other objectives have not been achieved due to
the poor implementation of the reform agenda. The PRSC’s proposal – to remove all restrictions
on access to subsidies based on farm ownership structure or size, and develop objective and
transparent eligibility criteria – was initially accepted by the Parliament. However, the Parliament
later back-tracked and re-instated farm-size classification. Increase in the share of subsidies going
to peasant farms has not materialized as planned. In 2008 and 2009, individual farmers received
only 10% of total subsidies, which is only a 1 percent increase as compared to the 2006 level.
While the planned subsidy budget was usually in line with PRSC commitments, the actual
subsidy amount paid to farmers always exceeded the planned amounts, due to higher-than-
expected claims on VAT refunds. Therefore, the share of agricultural expenditures on subsidies
relative to services did not decrease during 2006-2009 as expected under the PRSC. The share of
subsidies in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 were 73.4%, 76.7%, 73.1%, and 69.2% respectively,
falling short of PRSC’s target reduction of “3 percentage points in 2007 and 5 percentage points
every year thereafter?.


    C.2. Transportation Infrastructure

The government’s implementation of prior actions on transport infrastructure was quicker than
anticipated – it prepared and adopted a transportation infrastructure strategy that channeled 80%
of excise tax on fuel in 2009 (and 100% subsequently) into road maintenance. Amounts devoted
to road maintenance fell short of the minimum MDL 450 million expected in 2009 budget,
however. Road maintenance allocation for 2009 was only MDL 242 million, but this increased to
MDL582.9 million in the 2010 budget – the increase was one of the prior actions of the 2010
DPO. Though it increased from USD 14 million in 2006, the amount of MDL 515 million (about
USD 46 million) earmarked for major road rehabilitation in 2009 fell short of the USD 90 million
objective in the PRSC. To this end, the objective of the PRSC has been partially achieved.


    C.3. Education Spending

Improving the efficiency of Moldova’s public spending on education was a primary objective of
the PRSC series, with results measured by increasing the student/teacher and student/non-teacher
ratios from 12.7 and 24.9 (in 2005), and increasing the share of expenditures on non-wage quality
related items. The Ministry of Education and Youth (MEY) completed the draft strategy to
optimize school networks, but the strategy required substantial revisions. The draft strategy has
now been finalized and endorsed by the Bank, while piloting of the strategy in two raions is
currently under way. However, expected outcomes have not been achieved – the national average
of the ratio of pupils to teachers is 11.6 in 2009, even lower than in 2005, and the share of
expenditures on non-wage quality related items has not increased. Though implementation was



                                                 14
slow, increasing national student/teacher ratios will require more than piloting in two raions. So
the expected outcome was unrealistic.


    C.4. Promote efficiency of health care spending.

Under the PRSC, the government adopted procedures for direct contracting with autonomous
primary care providers to increase efficiency and transparency in the health sector. As a result,
the government’s health insurance company extended direct contracting to all regions of the
country – surpassing the target of at least 5% of primary care centers expected under PRSC 3. In
addition, the government passed a resolution to separate the management of primary care centers
from rayonal hospitals in 2008. All managers of primary health care centers in the country are
now competitively selected, surpassing even PRSC 3’s objective of at least 25%. The expected
outcome has been achieved – the government increased primary health care allocation from 17%
of total health spending in 2005 to 30.9%, slightly surpassing the 30% target.


    D. Public Procurement

Competition for public procurement contracts has increased while the use of sole source
contracting declined since 2005 as mandated under PRSC 1. In 2009, about 50.5% of total
contracts (71.36% of the total value of contracts) were awarded through open tenders, whereas
less than 10% of contracts were procured through single sourcing. Hence, the target set under the
PRSC i.e. no more than 10% of contracts awarded through single sourcing, and at least 50% of
total contracts (and 70% of total value of contracts) awarded by open tender – has been achieved.
The Public Procurement Agency (PPA) also publishes (on its websites) an annual public report on
the conduct and results of public procurement, as required.


Pillar III: Strengthening Social Protection Systems

    A. Completing Pension System Reform Program

The PRSC series aimed to establish individual accounts for 100 percent of all-known pension
fund contributors, and increase the correlation between pension payments made and individual
pension contributions. The government cleared data entry backlog of individual contribution in
the computerized contributions database. New data is now being entered on a continuous basis
therefore the objective of establishing individual accounts for 100 percent of all-known pension
fund contributors has been achieved. However, the correlation between contributions and
expenditures for all types of pensioners has not really increased, since contributions-based
pension payments have not yet started. Though some progress has been made, relevant secondary
amendments to the Pensions Law have not been completed, and the draft Strategy for unifying the
pension system has not been finalized. Therefore, expected outcomes have been partially
achieved.


    B. Enhancing the Distributional Efficiency of Social Assistance Benefit System.

The government approved a draft Law on Targeted Social Assistance which established the legal
basis for targeting poor Moldovans. Non-targeted social assistance programs were eliminated in
2009. The government also completed the system concept design for a unified database of the


                                               15
beneficiaries of cash-equivalent social assistance programs. Bidding documents for the computer
system have been approved, and bids opened in September 2010. Regardless, the status of the
expected outcome of the PRSC series – i.e. an increase in the share of poverty-targeted (i.e.
means-tested) social assistance program budget in the total social assistance from 17.7% in 2005
– cannot be properly evaluated, since means-testing did not exist in 2005. Categorical benefits
were the main instruments of the social safety net in the pre-PRSC era; hence it is not certain how
the baseline figure of 17.7% was obtained. Means-testing, introduced in 2008, stood at 2% of GDP in
2008 (or 9.5% of social safety net budget). A number of measures on improving social assistance
targeting, originating from the PRSC, were re-introduced under the DPO. Under the program, it is
expected that the share of social assistance benefits going to the poorest 20% of the population
will increase from the estimated 28% in 2008 to at least two-thirds by 2010.

Overall, the achievement of objectives of the PRSC program is moderately satisfactory. In each
of the three thematic areas, Moldova made substantial progress. Several PRSC objectives and
expected outcomes were substantially or partially achieved (see Annex 4). Few were not
achieved. As noted in the government evaluation report (Annex 6), nearly 80 percent of PRSC
measures were achieved, even though the few not achieved (e.g. pension reform, education
reform, and agriculture spending) were very important with major social and economic impact.
The cancellation of plans for PRSC 3 slowed reform momentum, and this weighed heavily on the
achievement of desired objectives and targets in many areas.


3.3.      JUSTIFICATION OF OVERALL OUTCOME RATING

Given that relevance of the program supported by the PRSCs is rated as satisfactory and the
achievement of program development objectives is rated as moderately satisfactory, the overall
outcome rating is rated as moderately satisfactory. .



3.4.      OVERARCHING THEMES, OTHER OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS

       A. Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

Moldova’s strong growth performance and the associated rise in real incomes played a critical
role in poverty reduction. According to the government’s Poverty Assessment Report (2010),
absolute poverty in Moldova fell from 30.2 percent in 2006 to 26.3 percent in 2009. Extreme
poverty has also declined, falling from 4.5 percent in 2006 to 2.1 in 2009. Likewise, the depth of
absolute poverty, measured by the poverty gap, also fell from 7.9 percent in 2006 to 5.9 percent
in 2009. Remittances played a significant role in overall poverty alleviation - according to the
2008 HBS data, 88 percent of the poor in the country do not have households’ members abroad
and do not receive remittances. Richer households are getting remittances coming from Russian,
Ukraine, and the EU. Poverty rates among households with migrant workers are 14.3 percent, but
22 percent among non-migrant households.

Some PRSC measures – for example, the development of agricultural markets (under Pillar 1) –
specifically focused on reducing rural poverty by ensuring that poor farmers received higher
prices for their crops. Yet, rural poverty in Moldova has increased: from 31.4 percent in 2006 to
36.3 percent in 2009. Any positive impact of the PRSC measures could have been obscured by
external factors like the drought in 2007, the food crisis in 2008, and the global economic



                                                16
downturn which led to (i) an 18.5 percent fall in average selling prices of farming goods in 2009,
and (ii) a 19 percent decline in remittances to rural areas in 2009. The policy measure – aimed at
better targeting social assistance payments to the poor through means-testing also made some
contributions to poverty alleviation. The government’s Poverty Assessment Report (2010)
acknowledges that social benefit payouts to the poor went up in rural settings in 2009, mitigating
to some extent the effects of the economic crisis. Broadly speaking, better implementation of
PRSC policy measures (especially agricultural spending) could have improved outcomes on rural
poverty.

None of the PRSC-supported programs were specifically directed toward gender issues.


    B. Institutional Change/Strengthening

The PRSC program had an impact on institutional reform in the areas of policy coordination,
trade facilitation, business regulation, civil service management, public financial management
(MTEF), procurement, roads maintenance, and pensions and social assistance. In some of these
cases, implementation has not been finalized hence reform efforts must be raised and maintained.
In essence, institutional changes must be closely-monitored to sustain attained or expected
benefits.


    C. Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

None.


   4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

Moldova’s prospects for sustaining the developmental objectives of the PRSC (where achieved),
face various risks, including: external shocks and financial sector risk; political uncertainty given
recent failure to elect a president; strong lobbying pressure to protect vested interests; and limited
institutional capacity.

Moldova is vulnerable to external market developments. Import price of natural gas will continue
to rise to European levels over the next five years, with significant consequences for the poor.
Any Russian ban on the export of wine and alcoholic beverages may create current account
imbalances beyond the sustainable levels, putting fiscal pressure on the government’s social
safety nets. Rising non-performing loans and declining risk appetite in financial intermediation
has limited access to much-needed funds for investment.

The failure to elect a president has intensified the power struggle between major political powers
and there is a risk that the reform agenda, which includes several politically-sensitive policy
actions, will not be finalized. Similarly, the risk of reversals in previously implemented policies is
also significant if powerful vested interests that distort business competition and reform in public
financial management exert pressure on a new government. Such policy reversals could also
jeopardize donor assistance. Finally, government’s institutional capacity remains weak and this
could limit implementation of the NDS agenda.

However, risks will decline in the medium to long-term, if global economic recovery gathers
momentum, and international donors continue to support the government’s institutional capacity


                                                 17
via technical assistance. Economic prospects will also improve if the incoming government
adheres to the IMF’s macroeconomic framework. The current EU-Moldova Action Plan will also
help mitigate risks. Overall, the risk to development outcomes in Moldova is rated is moderate.



   5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1.      BANK PERFORMANCE

       A. Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
                  
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

 At conception of the PRSC series, the Bank took positive steps to incorporate key lessons
learned under the previous poorly-implemented SACs program. Firstly, intervention through
policy-based lending was anchored on an evaluation of the government’s commitment to reform
(i.e. the attainment of high-case triggers in the 2004 CAS). Secondly, more efforts were made to
ensure country-ownership of the reform agenda, unlike in the SACs program which was largely
driven by Bank staff. The Bank aligned the PRSC with the priorities of the 2004 EGPRSP – the
government’s framework for tackling developmental challenges. Proposed policy actions were
also supported by a plethora of analytical work by the Bank and other donors to ensure their
positive impact on the developmental objectives. Thirdly, the PRSC series was broad-based
covering several sectors, and the Bank’s active engagement on so many policy areas would not
have been feasible in the absence of complementary activities in its investment lending and AAA
program. This arrangement provided some synergies. Fourthly, the Bank mobilized substantial
resources for much-needed technical assistance and capacity building through close collaboration
with donor partners in the development of the PRSC series. Finally, the Bank performed well in
terms of synchronizing its appraisal and approval of the PRSCs with the government’s budget
cycle so that the PRSC credits could be taken into account in the preparation of government’s
fiscal plans.

On the downside, the political economy was not well-understood by the Bank team at the time of
entry. In some cases like agriculture spending and social assistance, Bank-supported reform
action exceeded the depth and scope envisaged by government’s program. Therefore, the actual
political and technical capacity to implement its own program was weak. In addition, the program
was too broad in view of the government’s limited capacity. Choice of indicators was, for the
most part, reasonable, but there were instances when monitoring indicators and expected
outcomes were difficult to measure. For example, it is not clear how to measure the stated
outcome – “improvements in the quality of public investment projects selected for funding?. In
some cases, the expected outcomes were unrealistic, as under education spending, where the
expected outcome was an “increase in student/teacher and student/non-teacher ratios from 12.7
and 24.9 (in 2005) for public general schools in Moldova?. However, the associated policy action
was “the finalization of the schools optimization strategy and begin piloting in 2 pilot raions?.).
Surely, achieving the stated outcome will require more than piloting in two raions. Similarly,
policy measures do develop agricultural markets were too weak to deliver an improvement in
rural poverty headcounts.

       B. Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                                18
The quality of the Bank’s supervision effort was satisfactory in a number of respects. Firstly, the
Bank’s supervisory role was well-tailored to the challenges of the reform agenda and allowed the
optimal use of the program’s flexibility in reshaping the policy matrix to the realities of
implementation progress. It effectively informed the decision to abort PRSC 3 and introduce a
new DPO which maintained the spirit of PRSC 3. Secondly, the Bank maintained a high degree
of continuity among staff engaged on the PRSCs ensuring some efficiency. In addition, the
coordinated approach followed by PREM and sectoral staff contributed to sound supervision.
However, the major drawback is that the outcome of supervision was not well-reflected in the
program’s results framework. Targets and expected outcomes should have been revised in line
with the realities of implementation. .


       C. Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance.

Given the ratings for quality at entry and quality of supervision, discussed above, the Bank’s
performance is evaluated as moderately satisfactory.



5.2.      BORROWER PERFORMANCE

       A. Government Performance

Overall the government’s performance was moderately satisfactory. Prior to PRSC design, the
government appeared committed to reform with strong performance on CAS ‘high-case’ triggers.
As discussed in Section 3.2, some PRSC policy measures were not fully implemented and a few
targets were not met. Several modifications were made to the policy matrix and the sequencing of
policy actions to reflect this. While institutional changes (i.e. the establishment of a policy
coordination unit) and the creation of an inter-ministerial committee to monitor and evaluate the
process are commendable, reneging on previously-agreed policy measures (and scope) and the
implementation timeframe poses significant threats to serious reform and the attainment of
developmental objectives. Furthermore, in certain circumstances (e.g. agriculture), the
government was inefficient in utilizing donor-funded technical assistance and other support at its
disposal.


       B. Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

There is no reason to distinguish between overall government performance and the performance
of the implementing agency.


       C. Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

In light the above, the borrower’s performance is evaluated as moderately satisfactory.

   6.   LESSONS LEARNED

The following lessons were derived from the PRSC series and should be taken into consideration
in designing future development policy operations in Moldova:

   i.   The political economy must be understood and given due consideration because it
        affects the capacity of the authorities to implement their own program. Experience
        under the PRSC series highlights the importance of a country’s political structure for
        implementation of donor programs. In this instance, the World Bank team negotiated the
        PRSC policy matrix with the government – including several policy measures requiring
        legal amendments. However, in reality, the passage of legislation rests with the
        Parliament, which is outside the control of the government. Going forward, the
        government’s limitation in negotiating legal amendments within the policy reform agenda
        must be recognized. Policy reform measures requiring legal amendments should have
        broad country ownership and could involve upfront consultations with key stakeholders,
        including Parliament.

  ii.   The size and complexity of the policy matrix must be reasonable, and feasibly-
        balanced with the government’s program and institutional capacity. Even with the
        availability of donor-funded technical assistance, a large and complex policy matrix that
        simultaneously supports several aspects of the national program and involves virtually all
        government ministries – like that of the PRSC series – is difficult to co-ordinate and
        implement. Policy matrices of budget support operations must be kept simple, based on
        prioritized policy-actions, and focused on realistic targets.

 iii.   A strong focus on the results framework facilitates stock-taking of achievements
        during program implementation. The program matrix including the set of indicative
        outcomes facilitated the assessment of progress, provided a sound basis for and policy
        dialogue. 

 iv.    The Bank can play a strong role in mobilizing budget resources from the donor
        community to fund the program and conduct technical assistance for successful
        implementation. Close donor collaboration on a common policy framework – like the
        PRSC – significantly reduces transaction costs imposed on the government
        implementation. In addition to co-financing from DFID, and the Netherlands, other
        donors like the PHRD provided important technical assistance to build capacity in key
        areas supported by the PRSC series, thereby allowing greater efficiency in the use of
        donor resources, and more effectiveness in responding to the country’s needs.

  v.    Complex lending operations require strong field presence and cross-sector
        collaboration by the Bank team. In an environment where implementation capacity is
        weak, operations like the PRSC series require day-to-day supervision and strong cross-
        sectoral collaboration within the Bank on the policy agenda to deliver the expected
        outcomes of the lending program.

   7.   COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICR BY BORROWER/IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES

        (SEE ANNEX 2 FOR FULL TEXT OF BORROWER’S ICR)




   8. COMMENTS FROM COFINANCIERS ON THE DRAFT ICR

        (a) Comments from DFID (Full text)

The United Kingdom (DFID) supported the PRSC series by its commitment of £3 million to the
multi-donor trust fund confirmed under the DFID/World Bank arrangement of 7 March 2007.
From this commitment an amount of £2.5 million was transferred against PRSC’s 1 and 2. The
balance of £0.5 million could not be transferred because of the cancellation of PRSC 3.

DFID support for PRSC complemented its bilateral programme to Moldova which included
support for Government efforts at Public Administration Reform and establishment of a poverty
focused social assistance mechanism. The opportunity for DFID to contribute to PRSC was
welcomed as a way to minimize DFID’s internal administration commitments in its bilateral
programme management and also to reduce transaction costs in the Government’s relationship
with the donor community. The donor harmonization agenda formalized under the Development
Partnership Framework was also an important consideration.

DFID agrees that the rating of the PRSC series of “Moderately Successful? was appropriate for
this operation. The policy matrix as originally designed was over-ambitious and did not recognize
the complex political economy of public sector reform in Moldova and therefore some
modifications were required to the expected results. The shrinking fiscal and economic space
from 2008 onwards greatly constrained reforms in some areas. The ICR correctly records a mixed
picture of success with strong commitment apparent within triggers on energy reform and
procurement but less impressive on civil service reform, agriculture and education. DFID
considers reform of the distribution of social assistance benefits to have been largely successful
although the parallel operation of the nominal compensation system has limited the effectiveness
of the reform.
