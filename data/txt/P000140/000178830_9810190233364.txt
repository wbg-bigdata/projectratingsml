SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:             Republic of Botswana
Beneficiary:          Water Utilities Corporation
Amount:               US$4.4 million
Terms:                20 years repayment including 5 years of grace,
7.9 percent interest
Relending Terms:      25 years repayment including 5 years of grace,
7.9 percent interest
Project Description:
The Project would expand and improve the Francistown water supply
system and would finance preliminary investigations and design for expanding
the system in the Gaborone-Lobatse area. Major components include: (i) con-
struction of 26 km of pipeline, pump stations, treatment works and miscel-
laneous facilities; (ii) pumping and treatment plant, vehicles, tools, stores,
and miscellaneous equipment; and (iii) consulting engineering services to
supervise the Francistown improvements and investigate the feasibility of
raising the Gaborone Dam. The Project would meet Francistown's water re-
quirements until 1988/89, and would raise water quality to international
standards. The Project faces no technical risks, but WUC would have to raise
tariffs substantially from existing levels to recover project costs.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOTSWANA
FOR A SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Botswana for the equivalent of US$4.4 million to
help finance a second water supply project. The loan would have a term
of 20 years, including five years of grace, with interest at 7.9 percent
per annum. The proceeds of the loan would be relent to the Water Utilities
Corporation for twenty five years, including five years of grace with
interest at 7.9 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent "Economic Memorandum on Botswana" (Report No.
1832-BT) was distributed to the Executive Directors on April 20, 1978.
An updating economic mission to Botswana is scheduled for May 1980. Country
data are given in Annex I.
3.        Botswana is a landlocked country in southern Africa sharing borders
with the Republic of South Africa, Namibia, Zambia and Rhodesia. The country,
although the size of France, has only about 750,000 persons, three-quarters
of whom live in a relatively small eastern corridor. The Kalahari I)esert
(really a savannah) covers about two-thirds of the country. Rainfall is
highly erratic, and Botswana is subject to frequent droughts. Although over-
all water resources are substantial, the supplies readily accessible to the
eastern region are limited and could be inadequate during the late ].980s.
4.        Historically, livestock is the country's principal resource and
cattle raising still is the dominant economic activity for more than, 80 per-
cent of the population. Starting in the early 1970s, the exploitation of
Bots-wana's substantial mineral resources, however, has spurred economic
growth and improved the country's prospects for future development. During
the 1970s real GDP grew on the average about 10 percent annually and is ex-
pected to continue at a high level (about eight percent annually) over the
next decade. Estimated GNP per capita in 1978 was US$620. Economic expansion
has been fueled by diamond, nickel, copper and beef exports which have in-
creased rapidly during the past ten years. Although an outbreak of foot-and-
mouth disease reduced meat exports (the country's largest foreign exchange
earner until 1976) by 30 percent in 1978, rising revenues from diamonds more
than offset the decline.



-2-
5.        Since indeperdence in 1966, Botswana has made impressive gains
in its development, although the country still faces serious uncertainties
and constraints. Beginning in 1972/73, the Government (which is a net
creditor of the banking system) has managed to achieve recurrent budget
surpluses each year. These surpluses have covered nearly one-half of
steadily growing capital expenditures, which in earlier years were financed
fully from external sources. With rising income from the Southern Africa
Customs Union, direct taxes and minerals, the Government's recurrent re-
venues rose from P 29 million in 1972/73 to P 101 million in 1977/78.
Receipts from the Customs Union, composed of the Republic of South Africa,
Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, have been Botswana's most important revenue
source, accounting for more than one-third of the 1977/78 total. The economy
since 1973 also has shown overall surpluses in its balance of payments, and
at the end of 1978, international reserves equalled about five months of im-
ports. In 1975, Botswana established a central bank and in 1976, after
introducing its own currency, the pula (literally "rain"). withdrew from the
Rand Monetary Area.
6.        The country's rapid economic growth since independence often has
diverted attention from its vulnerability to external developments. The
uncertainty stemming from political events in southern Africa has adversely
affected not only internal and external security, but also revenue,
private investment and export earnings. The rail link which connects
Botswana with South Africa and Rhodesia, while crucial to Botswana's
livestock and mining sectors, is owned by the Rhodesian Railway Company.
Finally, the dominance of livestock and mining makes for considerable
openess in the economy and subjects it to sharp swings as prices in
and accessibility to export markets fluctuate.
7.        Despite significant progress over the past several years, insuf-
ficient physical infrastructure and shortages of technical and professional
manpower still hinder Botswana's development.  Public investments continue
to be concentrated in transport and communications, particularly in
completing to bituminous standards the vital north-south road. In addition,
the Government is working on plans to upgrade the nation's air transport
and to assume operation of the Botswana section of the railway.
With literacy probably less than 20 percent of the adult population at
independence, the country is rapidly expanding primary and secondary as
well as higher level educational and training facilities. Nevertheless,
Botswana's economy must still rely heavily on expatriates (who account for
about 80 percent of employees with uiniversity degrees). The demand for-
skilled expatriates probably will increase further with the economy's ex-
pected growth.
8.        Like other African countries dominated by livestock or mining,
Botswana also faces difficulties in reducing economic and social imbalances
that often accompany rapid growth. The traditional pattern of cattle



-3-
ownership, communal grazing practices and control of watering voints have
favored a limited number of Batswana. A 1974/75 survey revealeL that 45
percent of rural households own no cattle at all, another 20 percent own
fewer than 10 head, while five percent own about half the cattle. This
inequality in ownership has steadily widened as the size of herds expanded
and competition for grazing land and water increased (exacerbatecl by periodic
droughts which have eliminated some small cattle owners). The expansion of
herds also increasingly threatens to seriously damage or destroy the grazing
lands through overuse and erosion. To alleviate these ills, the Government
in July 1975 adopted a new "Tribal Grazing Land Policy", designecl to reform
the prevailing land tenure system, modernize ranch management ancd thereby
increase productivity.
9.        Botswana's development strategy aims at rapid economic growth,
more equitable income distribution, equal educational and employment
opportunities and diversification of external economic and trade relations.
The current Fourth National Development Plan (1976-81) emphasizefs invest-
ment in infrastructure, education and rural development. Planned public
expenditures, amounting to US$345 million, would imply an average annual
investment of 36 percent of GDP. The Plan projects real GDP to grow at
about 10 percent annually, based on expanding diamond production,, continuing
favorable terms for beef exports, and sustained copper/nickel output.
10.       Preliminary evaluation, however, suggests that the Plan's targets
may not be achieved fully. GDP growth, estimated at about six percent
between 1976 and 1978, has been slower than expected, mainly because of the
outbreak of foot and mouth disease, below average harvests and depressed
economic conditions in South Africa and other trading partners. In addi-
tion, a substantial share of the Government's development funds have had
to be diverted to security related expenditures, including maintenance of
refugees. The Government's financial position overall has not yet suffered,
since revenues from the Customs Union and from minerals grew fasiter than
expected. However, there is growing concern that recurrent budget surpluses
will be smaller than anticipated and, as a consequence, the country will
have to borrow more heavily from abroad.
11.         Multilateral and bilateral agencies have extended substantial
assistance to Botswana on highly concessional terms. The Bank Group has
been the main multilateral source, but the European Economic Community,
the African Development Bank and OPEC sources have also been active in
Botswana. Bilateral assistance has been diversified, the main sources
being the Federal Republic of Germany, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom and
the United States. Total outstanding and disbursed public debt amounted
to US$180.9 million in December 31, 1977. Service payments on debt during
1977 were US$5.5 million, implying a debt service ratio .f 2.7 percent.
If the grant element of future external capital requirements is reduced
from the current level of 60 percent to 40 percent, the debt service ratio
would increase from 3.5 percent in 1980 to a still manageable level of
6.4 percent in 1985. While the terms of assistance could harden somewhat
in the light of the country's growth, the country will still need
external assistance on concessionary terms in view of the possible disruption
of its development program due to political events.



-4-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BOTSWANA
12.         Botswana has received 14 loans and credits totalling US$107.2
million -- six credits (US$14.9 million) and eight loans (US$92.3 million),
including US$3.5 million on Third Window terms. These have financed four
road projects, two livestock projects, two urban projects, plus projects
for water supply, education, a development finance company (Botswana
Development Corporation - BDC), and engineering studies and infrastructure
for the Shashe mining complex.  IFC's first operation in Botswana, a US$362,500
equity participation in BDC, was approved in March 1979. Summary statements
of Bank Group Operations in Botswana are provided in Annex II.
13.         As of December 31, 1977, the Bank Group's share of Botswana's
external debt (disbursed only) was 30 percent (the share of IBRD alone was
21 percent)   and accounted for 69 percent of its debt service payments, a
reflection of the predominance of loans on favorable terms in Botswana's
external debt. About 80 percent of debt service payments to the Bank
Group, however, are for the Shashe infrastructure loans which are guaranteed
by a consortium of international mining companies. The Bank Group's
share of external public debt (disbursed) and debt service payments in 1985
is projected to be about 24 and 32 percent respectively.
14.         Overall, the Botswana Government and its agencies have demonstrated
good performance in the planning and execution of development projects.
Bank-assisted projects have encountered relatively few problems with two
exceptions: the Shashe copper/nickel mining project and the IDA-financed
first livestock project. Although the Bank-assisted infrastructure component
of the Shashe Project was completed on schedule, the mining operation has
experienced technical and financial problems since its inception. The company (BCL)
has now resolved most of its problems and achieved its annual rated production.
In 1978, the various parties concerned agreed to new financial arrangements
to give increased financial support to the company while ensuring the Govern-
ment would continue to receive substantial royalties, taxes and dividends.
Recently, a strike at the company which processes BCL's semi-refined metal
production,plus substantial future investment requirements at the mine location,
have raised questions about BCL's future financial viability. The project's
sponsors, its major lenders and the Government currently are discussing con-
tingent financing arrangements to sustain BCL in the short term while longer
term restructuring proposals are received.  The first livestock project has
experienced problems with several of its cattle ranches. Fencing of large
areas in the Kalahari region has proved complicated, and the boreholes serving
these ranches have operated poorly. In addition, the project's financial
objectives were affected by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in northern
Botswana in 1977. The Government has adopted some measures to resolve the
project's technical problems and has halted the spread of foot-and-mouth
disease, but it is unlikely the project will meet its financial objectives
when completed in early 1980.
15.         The Bank's future operations in Botswana include proposed
projects in the education, transport, industrial, and power sectors. We have
appraised a second education project to assist secondary and non-
formal education and improve skill training. A proposed fifth highway



-5-
project would improve road maintenance and expand the secondary road
system. The Bank plans to continue assisting small and medium-scale
enterprises by providing a second line of credit to the Botswana Development
Corporation. Feasibility studies have begun for a large, coal-fired
power station to meet Botswana's future power requirements.
SECTION III - THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Water Resources
16.         Botswana has substantial water resources; however, much of it
is in the vast Okavango river and delta system in the remote and sparsely
populated northwestern quarter of the country. In eastern Botswana, where
90 percent of the population lives, surface water is relatively scarce and
boreholes are the major source of supply. The country has over 5,000
registered and an estimated 2,500 unregistered boreholes. Yields usually
are small, however, and water quality in some areas is unacceptable for
human consumption due to high salinity and nitrate concentrations. Further-
more, ground water supplies around many villages and small towns often
are contaminated by inadequate control of livestock and human waste.
17,         Due to increasing demand and limited availability of water in
eastern Botswana, the Government recently commissioned several studies
to investigate alternative sources. The first, financed by
the UNDP, concluded that transferring water from the Okavango Delta to
the country's eastern corridor was unlikely to be economic in the
forseeable future. The second, financed by the African Development: Fund,
identified several alternative water sources in northeastern Botswana, in-
cluding the one now proposed for IBRD financing. A third study, undertaken
by the Government, is investigating the feasibility of developing supplies
from sand rivers in eastern Botswana; preliminary findings suggest that
such rivers probably could supply villages and small communities where demand
is limited.
Sector Organization
18.         In the water supply and sewerage sector, the Ministry of Mineral
Resources and Water Affairs (MRWA) and the Ministry of Local Government and Lands
(MLGL) are the most important agencies. MRWA, through the Department of Water
Affairs, is responsible for Botswana's total water resources and their
development. It secures and maintains hydrogeologic data; implements
rural water supply projects; designs, constructs and equips village water
systems; operates and maintains water supply systems in large vil:Lages
(population over 7,000); registers new boreholes; and provides training
for its own staff and village water supply operators. The Water Utilities
Corporation (WUC), a parastatal under the guidance of MRWA, is responsible
for water supply in urban areas.



-6-
19.         The Ministry of Local Government and Lands oversees and
coordinates activities of the town councils in Botswana's five urban
centers (Gaborone, Francistown, Lobatse, Orapa and Selebi-Phikwe), and
guides the affairs of smaller villages and towns through the district
councils, which report directly to the Ministry. The town councils are
responsible for preparing development plans for water and sewerage, for
health inspection, drainage, and the collection and disposal of wastes.
District councils operate and maintain water supplies in smaller villages
and towns (population under 7,000).
20.         Besides these agencies, the Ministry of Works develops plans
and sewerage designs and enforces construction standards. The Ministry
of Health's responsiblities include providing health education, monitoring
environmental sanitation, and operating a network of clinics and
health posts in rural and urban areas. The Bank-assisted Second Urban
Project (Ln 1584-BT) includes six health posts and one clinic in
Francistown.
21.       Botswana suffers from a shortage of skilled (and technically
qualified) manpower, which affects development in general and the water and
sewerage sector in particular. The country's educational system is unable
to meet the demands of rapidly growing mining and urban sectors. Through the
First Education Project (Loans 1274 and 1275-BT), the Bank is helping Botswana
overcome this shortage by expanding secondary, vocational and technical
education. A second project, which would continue such assistance, has been
appraised for possible Bank financing. Despite these measures, however,
Botswana will have to continue over the next several years to rely primarily
on expatriates to fill many of the senior positions in organizations, such as
WUC, which require managers with advanced engineering and technical expertise.
Sector Development and Policies
22.         Water and sewerage facilities have developed rapidly in the
last decade to meet demands generated by urban and mining development, and
the need to upgrade village water supply systems. During 1973/74-1975/76,
expenditures amounted to approximately US$22 million, of which about two-
thirds was for urban projects. Major water supply projects, affecting
about 70,000 persons, were completed in Gaborone, Lobatse and Selebi-Phikwe,
while in the rural areas, water supply schemes were completed in over 30
small-and-medium-size villages. By 1978, about 90 percent of the urban
population had access to piped water and 40 percent to adequate sanitation;
of the rural population approximately 30 percent had access to treated
water and substantially fewer to adequate sanitation.



-7-
23.         The Government plans to spend US$31 million for water supply
and sewerage in the Fourth National Development Plan (1976/77-1980/81).
Projects underway or proposed will affect all the major towns, benefiting
some 160,000 persons. Funds also are earmarked to complete water
supply schemes in 117 villages, raising the proportion of the rural
population having access to treated water to 40 percent. In addition to
World Bank support, Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, Sweden, the
United Kingdom and the United States have provided substantial help to
the Government's water and sewerage development program.
24.         It is the Government's policy to fully recover the cost of
supplying water supply and sewerage facilities in urban communities, but to
permit services in rural areas to be subsidized. Within urban areas,
standpipe users and small consumers are subsidized by large consumers.
The town councils collect fees for sewer service from individual plot
holders at rates that approximate the full cost of the service. In
rural areas, the district councils levy charges only on water delivered
through private connections with the charges based upon metered consumption.
While the fees collected at present do not equal the total cost of providing
service in the rural areas, the Government has based its charges on
affordability criteria and its procedures are satisfactory to the Bank
at this time.
Sector Characteristics in the Project Areas
25.         The Vroject would mainly benefit Francistown, a major itown
located in northeastern Botswana. Established in the 1890s as a mining
and trading center, Francistown's economy has been depressed in recent
years despite its location in the mineral-rich northern region. Part
of its decline has been due to the emergence of Gaborone as the country's
major commercial center. More importantly, Francistown has suffered
from its proximity (about 40 km) to Rhodesia and the uncertainties and
anxieties produced by the conflict across the border. Migration from
rural areas has created large squatter settlements which have stretched the
town's services to their limits. In 1977, more than one-half of the
population had yearly incomes below Botswanats urban poverty threshold.
26.         Of Francistown's 27,600 population (1978 estimate), around
90 percent had access to piped water. About 75 percent of the population obtained
water from standpipes, about 15 percent had private connections and
10 percent depended on private boreholes. In terms of sanitation, almost
two-thirds of the town's residents had no service whatsoever, about 4 per-
cent had access to sewers and another 30 percent used on-site sanitation
units. The Francistown Urban Development Project and the Second UJrban
Project (Cr 471-BT and Ln 1584-BT) will supply 7,000 low-cost san:itation
units in Francistown's squatter and low-income areas.



-8-
27.         Francistown now relies solely on boreholes for its water.
Production, about 2500 m3/day on a sustainable basis, closely corresponds
to existing  demand.       The Second Urban Project will construct
enough new boreholes to enable Francistown to meet its water needs
through 1980/81. Thereafter,additional supplies will be required to meet
projected demand, Moreover, the ground water underlying Francistown's
active well field has high nitrate concentrations and bacteriological
counts. Medical statistics, compiled on a regional basis, show a high
incidence of gastroenteritis and other water-related diseases in the
area around Francistown.
Previous Bank Group Projects
28.         Four Bank-assisted projects have helped develop Botswana's
water supply and sewerage sector. A US$3 million credit (Cr 223-BT), approved
in 1971, improved the Gaborone-Lobatse water supply system. The project
was completed in 1974, about two years behind schedule, but otherwise
all its objectives were achieved. Bank loans for the Shashe Infrastructure
Project (Ln 776-BT and 776-2-BT), approved in 1971 and 1974, included a malor water
supply component to serve the copper-nickel mining complex and township at
Selebi-Phikwe. The water supply facilities were commissioned in 1974,
after minor delays due to cost overruns and subsequent financing
difficulties. They have operated satisfactorily since their commissioning.
A major accomplishment was the establishment of the Water Utilities
Corporation to operate Botswana's urban water systems on a commercial
basis without subsidy. Since it began operations, WUC has been able to
meet this objective.
29.         The Francistown Urban Development Project (Cr. 471-BT),
approved in 1974, provided for improvements in Francistown's water supply
system and for low-cost sanitation units. While the project is substantially
completed, there have been delays in the selection of an appropriate low-cost
sanitation unit. Tests to determine the appropriate system will be completed
shortly and the units then constructed. A Second Urban Project (Ln 1584-BT),
approved in 1978, continues the Francistown program and also assists
Selebi-Phikwe. Project completion is scheduled for June 1982.
SECTION IV - THE PROJECT
30.       The Project, based on a study of water resources in northeastern
Botswana, was prepared by WUC and consultants. It was appraised in February
1979, and negotiations were held in Washington in September 1979.
Mr. O.K. Matambo, Director of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance and
Development Planning, led the Government delegation. A report entitled
"Staff Appraisal Report, Botswana, Second Water Supply Project" (No. 2531a-BT),
dated September 26, 1979, is being distributed separately. Annex III gives
supplementary information.

Project Objectives and Description
31.       The Project would (i) improve and increase Francistown's water
supply to meet projected demands in 1988/89, (ii) strengthen the town's
existing water system, and (iii) finance studies and preliminary designs
for expanding the Gaborone Dam reservoir to meet future supply requirements
for the Gaborone-Lobatse region. The Project comprises the following
components:
(a) Civil works consisting of: (i) raw water pipeline and pump
station; (ii) treatment works; (iii) treated water storage
and pump stations; (iv) supply mains and primary distribution
mains; (v) staff housing; and (vi) workshops and a laboratory;
(b)  Pumping and treatment plant;
(c) Vehicles, spares, stores, miscellaneous equipment, tools,
furniture and chemicals; and
(d) Consulting engineering services for: (i) design and construction
supervision of the above works; and (ii) investigation of
foundation materials, field surveys and preparation of pre-
liminary designs for raising Gaborone Dam.
32.       The Project would provide for water from WUC's Shashe Dam reservoir,
located 25 km south of Francistown on the Shashe River, to be treated and
pumped to a ground level storage facility in Francistown. There it would be
blended with water from Francistown's boreholes and distributed to consumers.
Estimates of the safe yield of Shashe Dam's reservoir indicate that it can
meet the combined water demands of Selebi-Phikwe and Francistown Lntil about
1992, after which the dam would have to be raised. The Project also would
finance 125 staff months of consultant services to design and supervise
the construction of Francistown works and about 15 staff months to investigate
the raising of Gaborone Dam, which currently supplies Gaborone's water
requirements and is a major source of water for Lobatse. The annual yield of
the dam is sufficient to meet the combined demands of Gaborone and Lobatse
until the mid-1980s. To provide for additional storage capacity to meet
Gaborone-Lobatse's long-term water requirements, engineering investigations
and preliminary designs of the required works should be initiated by 1981.
Project Costs and Financing
33.        Project costs (net of taxes and duties of about US$42,DOO) are
estimated at US$6.3 million. Foreign exchange costs would amount to about
US$4.4 million, or 70 percent of total project expenditures. Baseline
costs are estimated at December 1979 price levels and an allowance ranging
between 10 and 20 percent has been added for physical contingencies. Price
contingencies for all project components are nine percent per annum.
34.       The Bank would lend US$4.4 million to the Government fcr
20 years with a 5 year grace period at 7.9 percent interest; it
would be relent to WUC at the same interest rate,



- 10 -
with repayment over 25 years, including five years of grace with interest
capitalized during the construction period. Execution of the Subsidiary
Loan Agreement on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank would be a
condition of loan effectiveness (see Section 6.01(a) of the draft Loan
Agreement). The Government plans to share the foreign exchange risk on the
Bank loan with WUC through a scheme whereby WUC's maximum risk would be
limited to a 3 percent fluctuation between the pula and the relevant foreign
currency.  The scheme's operational details would be reviewed by the Bank
prior to their insertion in the Subsidiary Loan Agreement. The Government
also would lend WUC the equivalent of US$2.3 million to cover the Project's
local costs as well as the interest on the Bank loan during the construction
period (US$0.4 million). The second loan would be at 6 percent interest,
with 25 years repayment, including 6 years of grace (during which interest
would be waived). The interest rates for both proposed loans to WUC (7.9
percent and 6.0 percent) are low in comparison to Botswana's past and projected
annual rates of inflation (12 percent, 1976-78; 9 percent 1979-81). They
are less than the rates charged by local commercial banks (about 10 percent),
although these institutions in general do not lend long term to parastatals.
The Government has based its proposed loan terms on affordability criteria.
Harder terms would require WUC   to raise Francistown's water tariffs in the
FY85-87 period substantially in excess of the long-term marginal cost of
water, whereas the proposed terms for both loans to WUC would permit gradual
tariff increases in line with marginal costs and affordability (para. 42).
On these grounds, they are considered appropriate for the Project.
Implementation
35.       WUC would be responsible for project implementation.  It has employed
Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners to provide the engineering required under the
Project. This arrangement is satisfactory to the Bank. Initial engineering
work began in May 1979 and physical components of the Project are planned
to be commissioned by December 1981.
36.       Until recently, the Francistown Town Council owned, operated and
maintained its water system. WUC assumed operational control on October 1,
1979 and, in anticipation, made necessary arrangements to increase staff and
provide for related facilities. For organizational and financial purposes,
WUC intends to manage the Francistown facilities as a self-accounting operation
known as the "Francistown Undertaking", to be headed by a senior water works
superintendent. The legal transfer of Francistown's water supply assets to
WUC would be accomplished through a Tripartite Agreement between WUC, the
Francistown Town Council and the Government. Execution of
the Agreement would be a condition of effectiveness (Section 6.01(b) of the
draft Loan Agreement).
37.       In recent years, WUC's accounts have been audited satisfactorily
by an international accounting firm. WUC wouldsubmit its audited accounts,
including separate accounts for the Francistown Undertaking, not later than
five months after the close of each financial year (Section 4.02 of the
draft Project Agreement). WUC's consolidated financial performance has been
satisfactory since it began operations. To ensure that WUC's future borrowings



- Ll -
are commensurate with its ability to service debt, WUC would consult with
the Bank before incurring any future debts in excess of P 55,000 (Section 4.03
of the draft Project Agreement). WUC, which at present is managed capably,
would consult with the Bank before appointing a new chief executive officer
(Section 3.02 of the draft Project Agreement).
Procurement
38.       Approximately 81 percent of the total project costs would involve
construction, supply and erection contracts, about 83 percent of wllich would
consist of civil works. Equipment and pipe are not manufactured locally nor
are there suitable local contractors to undertake the civil works. Three
main contracts are planned to cover civil works, pumping plant and treatment
plant. In addition, "minor" contracts are planned for procurement of vehicles,
tools, stores, miscellaneous equipment and technical services (for modifi-
cation of existing pumping equipment). Except as indicated below, all pro-
curement financed by the loan would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Procurement for
each of the "minor" contracts may be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder
after solicitation of quotations from at least three suppliers. Such pro-
curement would be limited to single items costing less than US$50,000 equi-
valent each and US$150,000 equivalent in the aggregate.
Disbursements
39.       The propcsed loan would be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) 65 percent of total expenditures for civil works; (b) 100 percent of
foreign expenditures or 90 percent of local expenditures for modification of
pump installations,pumping and treatment plant, vehicles, spares, stores,
miscellaneous equipment, tools, furniture and chemicals; and (c) 100 percent
of foreign or 75 percent of total expenditures for consulting services.
Retroactive financing of up to US$120,000 equivalent would be authorized to
cover the engineering expenses incurred after February 1, 1979 (Schedule 1
of the draft Loan Agreement). The Project is expected to be completed by
early 1982.
Tariffs and Cost Recovery
40.       Tariffs in Francistown, which recently were raised from an average
of P 0.28 to approximately P 0.38 per m3 (US$1.73 perlOOO US gallons), should
enable the newly created Francistown Undertaking in FY81 to earn about 11
percent of its net operating assets. After that, however, the race of re-
turn would decline sharply as investments in the new Project were committed.
In order to earn an eight percent return (the levels specified in the Bank's
loans for the Gaborone-Lobatse and Shashe water supplies) over the next
several years, Francistown's average tariff would have to be increased
drastically--by almost three times in current and double in constant 1979



- 12 -
prices (to the equivalent of US$3.50 per 1000 US gallons).L/ Such a tariff
would far exceed the estimated long-term marginal cost of supplying the
water (US$2.18 per 1000 US gallons in 1979 prices). Moreover, the tariff
structure needed to produce an eight percent return would make water virtually
unaffordable for most Francistown residents (para. 42).
41.       In Francistown, therefore, average tariffs would be raised yearly
during 1981-86 so as to cover operating and maintenance expenses and depre-
ciation or debt service (whichever is higher) and would approximate the long-
run marginal cost of supplying the water. These tariffs are expected to earn
returns on net revalued assets in the Francistown Undertaking of 11 percent
in 1981, an average of zero percent during 1.982-84, increasing to three
percent in 1987 and thereafter (Section 4.04(a) of the draft Project Agree-
ment). To permit flexibility in setting tariffs to meet required rates of
return, WUC could, if it elected, set tariffs in Francistown based on an
average of two years returns on net revalued assets rather than on a single
year's figure (Para. 5.11 of the Staff Appraisal Report). The agreed arrange-
ments allow WUC to set tariffs for a particular year (provided the prior
year's rate of return was higher than specified in the Project Agreement) so
as to earn an average return during the current and preceding year at least
equal to the average of the two rates stipulated in the Project Agreement
(Section 4.04 (a)). It has furthermore been accepted that the return in
any single year should not be more than two percentage points below the rate
specified in the Project Agreement. As far as the Gaborone-Lobatse and
Shashe water supply systems are concerned, they are expected (with only moderate
tariff increases in the former) to be able to maintain the required eight
percent rates of return on operating assets. In calculating rates of
return, WUC would revalue the assets of each annually using the Government's
"Urban Cost of Living Index in Botswana". These provisions should ensure
that WUC, as a whole, remains financially viable and should enable it to
realize an overall return on its assets of at least seven percent annually
during the next several years.
Affordability
42.       Although the average water tariff in Francistown would be higher
than for other towns in Botswana, the actual tariff structure itself would
permit basic consumption at levels affordable by the poorest members of the
population. This basic charge, or social tariff, applies to water from
standpipes and the first 10 m3 from individually-metered connections. In
Francistown, the rate at present is P 0.22 per m3 (compared with P. 0.20 and
P 0.19 per m3 in the Gaborone-Lobatse and Shashe Divisions). More than 50
percent of Francistown's population are thought to fall below Botswana's
"urban poverty threshold" (estimated at P 91 per month in 1979 for a household
of 4.5 persons), with a median household income of about P 55 monthly. If
a connected household consumed about 40 liters per person daily for basic needs
at the estimated social tariff in FY87 (when tariffs would be highest) of
P 0.25 per m3 (in 1979 prices), then it would spend about 3 percent of its
monthly income on water, a level which is considered acceptable.
1/ For comparison, average 1979 tariffs in some Eastern Africa countries in
US dollars per thousand US gallons at official exchange rates are: Sudan--
2.73; Kenya (Nairobi)--l.59; Lesotho--l.44 (proposed); Somalia (Mogadishu)--
1.20; and Madagascar--0.87 (proposed).

Benefits and Riskb
43.       The Project is Francistown's least-cost alternative to meeting
its water needs up to 1989. It also would produce significant, though
unquantifiable, public health benefits by improving the quality of irinking
water, which at present does not meet internationally accepted standards
due to excessive nitrate concentrations and high bacteriological counts.
Shifting the source of supply from groundwater to surface sources would
improve both availability and quality, reducing the current high incidence
of water-related diseases in the Francistown area. The population, more than
one-half of whom are below the "urban poverty threshold," would be the main
beneficiary. The Project also would improve the reliability of Francistown's
water supply by upgrading the system's pumping and storage capacity and
would, through financing investigations of and preliminary engineering for
raising the Gaborone Dam, lay the groundwork for meeting the Gaborone-
Lobatse area's water needs after mid-1980.
44.       Studies concluded that supplying water from the Shashe Dam, as
proposed, would be the least-cost way of meeting Francistown's water re-
quirements (para. 16). Without the Project, Francistown's population would
be exposed to increased contamination of their water supplies, and growth
of the town's industrial and manufacturing sectors would be limitedt. The
economic return on the proposed investment in Francistown (90 percent of the
project costs) is estimated to be about 11 percent. If benefits (i.e., the
water supplied) are valued at the present average tariff of P 0.38 per m3,
the return would be 9 percent. A 10 percent increase in costs or decline in
revenues would lower the return by 1 and 1.5 percent respectively. The
return on investment, of course, would be higher if other unquantif-ied
benefits, such as improved water quality, were included in the analysis.
45.       Construction of the Project, since it is straight-forward, would
not pose any sigtificant risk. There is some risk that the WUC, for one
reason or another, would not be able to raise Francistown water tariffs
sufficiently to meet financial requirements. This risk, however, :is not
large because WUC plans to raise tariffs gradually and since the Government
is opposed in principle to subsidizing urban water consumers.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Government of Botswana and
the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between tha Bank and the Water Utilities
Corporation, and the Report of the Committee provrided for in Article III,

BOTSWANA
C. STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION AS OF MAY 31, 1979
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Credit No. 325--Livestock Development Project:  US$1.65 Million
Credit of June 30, 1972; Effectiveness Date--April 10, 1973;
Closing Date--April 30, 1980
The project's status deteriorated during the last 6 months. The
Nojane ranches are overstocked and mismanaged, the water facilities and fences
continue to break down and the extension service has failed to alter traditional
practices. A revised cash flow projection indicates that these ranches will
have difficulty in meeting debt servicing commitments. BLDC continues to have
financial problems due largely to the foot-and-mouth induced curtailment
of trading. Government is aware of the above problems and is discussing
proposals to solve them. It also is considering ways to alter BLDC's
financial structure, so that it will be in a viable position to resume trading
when the restrictions are lifted later this year.
Loan No. 1497--Second Livestock Project: US$6.5 Million Loan of
December 30, 1977; Effectiveness Date--November 27, 1978; Closing
Date--June 30, 1983
The project is behind schedule mainly due to an eight month delay in
achieving effectiveness. However, sound preparation for all components has
occurred and their implementation should gather tempo for the next six months.
Lease format is finalized and ranches are being allocated prior to their
development. The National Development Bank is ready to solicit and process
loan applications. The Commissioner of Agricultural Management Associations
is in post and his organization is staffed and processing applications.
The Agricultural Program Research Unit has commenced construction of the
first of its experimental units. The Ranch Management Training Centre is
prepared to train its first intake; and project management is satisfactory.
Progress in remodelling the railway livestock handling facilities has been
slow, but the plans have been recently completed and approved by the Rhodesian
Railway Authority.
URBAN SECTOR
Credit No. 471--Francistown Urban Development Project: US$3.0
Million Credit of May 9, 1974; Effectiveness Date--October 1, 1974;
Closing Date--December 31, 1979
Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily. Civil and
electrical works are complete; progress on community facilities is satisfactory;
most of the residential plots have been allocated, and housing construction
is progressing well. The houses are of much better quality than usual in
site and service areas. Additional works, using surplus funds generated
by the devaluation of the rand, are progressing satisfactorily and are expected
to be completed by mid-1979. The closing date was extended from December 1978
to December 1979, to enable completion of the additional works.



-23 -                 ANNEX II
Loan No. 1584--Second Urban Project: US$8.0 Million Loan of
May 10, 1978; Effectiveness Date--June 20, 1979; Closing Date--
December 31, 1982
Project implementation has begun and is proceeding satisfactorily
following delays in loan effectiveness. Site improvements have begun in
Francistown and will commence shortly in Selebi-Phikwe.
DFC
Loan No. 1019--Botswana Development Corporation Project:  US$4.0
Million Loan of June 27, 1974; Effectiveness Date--December 9, 1974;
Closing Date--December 31, 1981.
Medium- and large-scale industrial investment activity in Botswana
remains depressed due to political uncertainties in southern Africa and limited
investment opportunities in Botswana. The small-scale enterprise program is
jointly being implemented by Barclays Bank and BDC. Due to the slow commit-
ment of the loan, the subproject submission and closing dates have recently
been extended at BDC's request to December 31, 1979 and December 31, 1981,
respectively. As of April 30, 1979, 67.8 percent of the loan had been
committed.
TRANSPORT
Loan No. 1174--Third Road Project: US$5.8 Million Loan of
November 21, 1975; Effectiveness Date--January 12, 1976; Closing
Date--December 31, 1980.
Project implementation is about 1-1/2 years behind schedule, due
to the unusually heavy demands on an understaffed Roads Department, delays over
the approval of tender documents, and contractor problems, but progress in all
components is now improving. The construction of Molepolole-Gaborone road
was completed in May 1979. Detailed engineering of the Mahalapye-'Serule
road, the Highway Maintenance Pilot Study are now being finalized and the
study should begin shortly. The Loan Agreement was amended in November 1978
to include a feasibility study and detailed engineering for a 77 km road and pur-
chase of traffic counters. These additional components were financed out of
savings estimated at US$1.2 million on the road construction component of
the project.
Loan No. 1408--Fourth Road Project: US$20.0 Million Loan of
April 21, 1977; Effectiveness Date--August 18, 1977; Closing
Date--December 31, 1981
Progress is satisfactory. The contract for construction of the
Mahalapye-Serule road was signed on November 22, 1977. Implementation of the
Road Maintenance Program has been delayed by about one year because of delays
in finalizing the maintenance study report and decisions on equipment procure-
ment. The Loan Agreement was amended in August 1978 to include construction
of 17 km of road, a feasibility study and detailed engineering of roads in the



-24 -                  ANNEX II
Tuli Block area and technical assistance for the Roads Department. The
additional components were financed out of savings estimated at US'$5.5
million on the road construction component of the project.
EDUCATION SECTOR
Loans No. 1274 and 1275-T--Education Project: US$10.5 Million
(US$7.0 Million IBRD and US$3.5 Million Third Window) of May 28,
1976; Effectiveness Date--September 10, 1976; Closing Date--March 31,
1982
Implementation is satisfactory and the project is expected to be
completed with full disbursement of the loan proceeds by March 31, 1982, the Loan
Closing Date. Latest cost estimates indicate about a six percent increase
in total project cost. Disbursement is lagging due basically to the lack of
urgency in preparing the necessary documentation. This documentation is
currently under preparation.
D. EXISTING IFC INVESTMENTS
Botswana Development Corporation, 448-BT, DFC
IFC has agreed to purchase shares in the Botswana Development
Corporation (BDC) and will provide technical assistance to its management
by being represented on BDC's Board of Directors.
