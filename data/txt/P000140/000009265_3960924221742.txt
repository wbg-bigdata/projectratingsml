SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT - LOAN 1763-BT
COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is a report on the completion of the Second Water Supply
Project in Botswana, for which a Loan 1763-BT of US$4.4 million equivalent
was approved in October 1979. The borrower was the Government of Botswana
which relent the proceeds of the loan to the Water Utilities Corporation
(WUC) which was responsible for implementing the project. The loan was
closed 18 morths late in June 1984. There were no major cancellations.
The report was prepared by the Water and Urban Development
Division of the East Africa Region Projects Department on the basis of the
findings of a mission to Botswana in January 1984, documents contained in
the regional files and a draft completion report prepared by the WUC and
its consultants. At the time of the initial PCR preparation mission,
the project had been substantially complete for 18 months and had been in
operation for about 21 months. Loan closure was delayed to enable WUC to
seek reimbursement of retention monies due to contractors wiho were required
to complete some remedial works found to be necessary during the
maintenance period, and which had been extended for this purpose.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED has cent copies of the draft
report to the Government and the Executing Agency for comments. WUC's
comments are attached to this report, see Annex 6 and reflected in the
respective parts of the report.

BOTSWANA
SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT - LOAN 1763-BT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The project has met all its objectives and has provided
Francistown, the second largest town in Botswana, for the first time in
many years with a reliable supply of unpolluted water which is expected to
be adequate to meet the towns needs until abiut 1992. By doing this it has
also provided the Government with the opportunity to divert new industries
from Gaborone where there is an acute water shortage and in this respect
has exceeded the original objectives (para. 4.04). Previous urban
development and water loans and credits contributed to the preparation and
development of the project (para. 1.04 t:) 1.06).
The financial results which are better than expected, have
demonstrated the consumers willingness to pay a high price for quality and
service in the country where water is at a premium (para. 4.01). The
appraisal report underestimated the demand, mainly because of the lack of
data regarding past consumption and other statistics on which to base
estimates (para. 2.07).
Completion of the project is a further step in establishing the
Water Utilities Corporation as an efficient autonomous state enterprise,
operating on comercial lines. Management is however dependent on
expatriates who occupy the top 20 posts. The lack of an adequate pipeline
of local professionals in training to replace the expatriates represents a
potential danger of deterioration in management efficiency if expatriates
cannot be found in adequate numbers in the future (para. 6.01 to 6.03).
The Bank's performance demonstrates the disadvantages of
excessive interference in the details of project design. In this case the
Bank's intervention caused needless delays for estimated marginal savings
in costs which may not materialize in the long run (para. 3.05). Final
costs were 15.2% above the appraisal estimates in terms of local currency
(6.4% in US$) which was low in relation to inflation rates in Southern
Africa at that time (para. 3.10).

SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT - LOAN 1763-BT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
The Sector
1.01      Most of Botswana is desert and 90% of the population is
concentrated in a relatively narrow strip along the eastern border.
Although there are substantial supplies of good quality water in the
Okavanga River in the sparsely populated north, and lesser quantities in
the border rivers of the east, the country is generally water deficient.
Of the population of about 750,000 in 1978, about 160,000 or 21% were
concentrated in five principal towns, substantially all of whom had access
to public water supplies. In addition many villages, had public supplies
provided by District Councils with help from the Ministry of Works and the
Ministry of Local Government and Lands. The Government's Fourth
Development Plan 1976/77 to 1980/81 contained water supply schemes for 117
villages which raised the proportion of rural population having access to
clean water from about 30% in 1978 to 40% in 1980/81.
1.02      The Water Utilities Corporation (WUC) was created in 1970 as an
autonomous parastatal authority to operate the water supply facilities of
the Shashe Infrastructure Project, and was required to take over water
supplies to the Gaborone-Lobatse area within a short time from the
Government-owned Gaborone Water and Electricity Unit. Since then it has
taken over the water supply facilities of Francistown in 1979, previously
run by the Municipality, and responsibility for water supplies to Jwaneng,
from the Debswana mine management in 1985. Jwaneng is a rapidly developed
diamond mining town. All other public water supplies are provided ay
District Councils and the DWA. WUC, which is required by its statute to
operate on sound commircial lines, is already responsible for public water
supplies to all major townships in Botswana, with the exception of Orapa,
(also a mining town) where security problems are an issue.
1.03      One of the Government's goals is to encourage industry to locate
in areas where ample water supplies are available. The project has been
instrumental in furthering this objective by diverting some new industries
from other areas where there is a shortage of water to Francistown which
now has ample supplies from the Shashe Dam.



- 2-
Banks Involvement in the Sector
1.04      The Bank's association with the water sector began with a Credit,
233-BT of US$3 million in 1971 for expansion of supplies to
Gaborone-Lobatse and establishment of the WUC. Two other loans for the
Shashe Infrastructure Project (Loan 770-I BT in 1971 and Loan 776-2 BT
1974) included finance for major water supply components to serve the
Bamangwato Concessions Ltd. (BCL) mining project and the township of
Selebi-Pikwe, An additional Credit 471-BT in 1974 and a Loan 1584-BT in
1978 for urban development in Francistown and Selebi-Pikwe also included
water supply elements.
1.05      The Second Urban Project, Loan 1584-BT of 1978, contained a
covenant that the Government would complete its intended transfer of
responsibility for water operations in Francistown, from the Town Council
to the WUC by April 1, 1979.
1.06      The Second Water Supply Project loan 1763-BT of January 9, 1980
for US$4.4 million, which is the subject of this report, was made to
Government for onlending to WUC at the same interest rate as the Bank loan
(7.9%), but with repayment over 25 years instead of 20 years, including a
grace period of 5 years in each case. The project was in two parts. Part
A of the project was designed to complement the earlier loans and credits
for urban development by providing an ample long term water supply of high
quality to augment and largely replace the existing poor quality and
inadequate borehole supplies of Francistown. Part B cf the project
included consultants services for site investigation and assign work in
connection with a proposal to raise the height of thia Gaborone Dam by 8
meters.
1.07      Part B of the project formed the basis of a third loan 2333-BT
for US$22 million (approved on July 7, 1983) for raising the Gaborone Dam,
extension of mains and treatment works in and around Gaborone township as
well as construction of service reservoirs and pumping stations. The loan
also includes financing of studies and preliminary design work on two other
dam sites, and studies for manpower development.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin
2.01      In recognition of the rapidly increasing water demands in the
eastern part of the country, the Government in the mid-1970s commissioned a
number of studies with financial help from the UNDP and the African
Development Fund. Their purpose was to investigate the feasibility of
developing supplies from (a) the principal streams of northeastern
Botswana; (b) the Okavanga Delta; (c) eleven sand rivers of eastern
Botswana; and (d) boreholes; and in the light of these investigations to
prepare a long term Master Plan for development of future supplies to
Francistown.



- 3 -
2.02      Following these studies, which showed that the Shashe Dam
reservoir was the least cost alternative having regard to the need to
improve the quality of existing supplies from local wells, the Bank's
Second Urban Project (Loan 1584-BT) included a requirement that the
Government should prepare a plan of action, including a timetable, for
provision of long term supplies to Francistown. In May 1978 the Government
requested the Bank's assistance in financing a project based on their
con-,1tants recommendations and feasibility report.
Preparation, Appraisal, Negotiation and Approval
2.03      A Bank preappraisal mission in August 1978 confirmed the
conclusions of the feasibility report but called for a refinement of the
Francistown demand forecasts, the existing demands on the Shashe facilities
and the required water treatment facilities. The result of these
refinements proved satisfactory and the project wab appraised in February
1979.
2.04      Negotiations took place in September 1979.  Discussions focussed
mainly on (i) the execution of a tripartite agreement between the
Government, the Francistown Town Council and the WUC for transfer of the
existing facilities to WUC on terms acceptable to the Bank; and (ii) the
terms of the subsidiary loan agreement for onlending the proceeds of the
Bank loan to WUC. Execution of these agreements was made a condition of
effectiveness.  Other covenants discussed and agreed were the keeping of
separate accounts for Francistown and the adjustment of tariffs to enable
the undertaking to earn specified rates of return on revalued assets in
future years.  Appointment of consultants acceptable to the Bank for design
and supervision of construction and consultation with the Bank over any
appointment to the position of Chief Executive Officer of WUC were also
agreed with the borrower because of a shortage of professional staff and
the organization's dependence on a very small number of expatriates.
2.05         During the negotiations the Government explained that it had
already approved a plan for sharing the exchange risk on external loans
with parastatal bodies such as WUC, but the mechanics of how this should be
put into effect had not been worked out. It was agreed that when the
details had been worked out, they should be incorporated in a side letter
to the supplemental agreement for onlending the proceeds of the loan,
subject to the Bank's agreement on the basis of sharing. The loan was
approved by the Bank's Executive Directors on October 23, 1979.
The Projects' Role in the Long-Term Plan
2.06      The project was the first stage of a Master Plan for meeting
Francistown's water requiremens. It was estimated to be capable of
meeting the town's demand up to 1988/89. With relatively minor additions
to the pumping and treatment works at Shashe, it was expected to be capable
of meeting the demand up to 1995/96.  At that time it would be necessary to
provide additional pipeline capacity to cope with peak demands in excess of
12,000 cubic meters per day.
2.07      No adequate records of production and consumption in Francistown
were available because prior to WUC's takeover, the water system was only
partly metered by the Town Council. The consultants therefore metered



- 4 -
representative samples of consumers over a period in order to estimate past
and future consumption for various land uses. A Population Growth Study
commissioned by the Government in 1977 came up with a rather pessimistic
estimate of 6% per annum compared with 10.4% projected for all urban
areas. There was therefore little reliable data on which to base
forecasts, a situation which was complicated by the fact that the Town
Council's charges for water were well below the economic cost, which may
have distorted the consultant's sampling of representative consumers. In
any event, the forecasts of both growth and consumption proved to be
conservative.
2.08      Existing supplies in Francistown were obtained from boreholes in
the township area beside the Tati river. These supplies were polluted and
contained excessive nitrate concentrations-possibly because sewer service
was not introduced until the mid 1970s, and then only to
commercial/industrial plots and a few high income residential plots. Apart
therefore from augmenting supplies, one of the principal objectives of the
project was to improve the quality of water delivered to consumers.
Project Description
2.09.     The project consisted of two parts:
(a) Part A--comprised:
(i) the construction of a treatment works, pumping station and
additions to staff housing at the Shashe Dam;
(ii) a 26 km pipeline to Francistown, and provision of a booster
pumping station, a service reservoir and additional primary
distribution mains in the town, and
(iii) construction of a workshop, laboratory and stores and
provision of operational requirements such as tools, stores,
vehicles, etc.
(b) Part B--comprised:
(i) consulting services to investigate the feasibility of raising
the Gaborone Dam and the preparation of a preliminary design.
Although the project was designed to deliver 8000 cubic meters of water per
day to Francistown initially, provision has been included for the
installation of additional pumps and treatment facilities at a later date
to increase the through-put to the full pipeline capacity of 12000 cubic
meters per day.
Covenants
2.10      The principal covenants in the Loan Agreement were:
(i) the government would relend the proceeds of the loan to WUC at
the same rate of interest (7.9%) as the Bank loan but with
repayment of principal over 25 years including five years grace,
instead of 20 years including five years grace; and



- 5 -
(ii) the government would lend WUC the equivalent of US$2.3 million at
6% interest, with repayment of principal over 25 years including
6 years grace to cover the local currency requirements of the
project.
2.11      The principal covenants in the Project Agreement were:
(i) WUC would employ consultants acceptable to the Bank for design
and supervision of construction of Part A, and for carrying out
Part B of the project;
(ii) WUC would consult the Bank regarding the suitability of
candidates for appointment to the position of Chief Executive
Officer;
(iii) WUC would not incur debt in local currency in any financial year
in excess of Pula 55,000 without the Bank's agreement; and
(iv) WUC would adjust Francistown tariffs so that the undertaking
would earn a rate of return on revalued assets of at least 11% in
1981, 0% in 1982 through 1984 rising by 1% per annum until 1987
and 3% thereafter.
2.12      The reason for the relatively soft-lending terms to WUC, and the
low rate of return, was that the undertaking taken over by WUC was in poor
physical and financial shape, and it was expected to require some years of
rehabilitation, good management and expansion, before tariffs could be
raised to a level compatible with the costs of providing the service.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, OPERATION AND COST
Effectiveness and Project Start-up
3.01      Conditions of effectiveness were that the subsidiary loan
agreement and the tripartite agreement should have been executed
(para. 2.04). There were no problems in completing the tripartite
agreement which was signed in May 1980 after some bureaucratic delays in
initiating its preparation. In the case of the subsidiary loan agreement,
there was a delay of about 4 months in reaching agreement between the Bank
and Government over the complicated wording of the side letter about
sharing the exchange risk (para. 2.05). The side letter was signed on
August 13, 1980 and the loan became effective on September 18, 1980. The
delay of 4 months did not however affect the start of the project.
3.02      Design work and preparation of bidding documents by the
consultants proceeded in parallel with the Bank's processing of the loan
application, and the three principal contracts for civil works, pumping
equipment and treatment works were awarded before the loan became
effective. There was a delay of about 4 months in issuing bidding
documents for the main pumping equipment due to a protracted discussion
between the Bank and the consultants over the details of the design
specification. This in turn delayed the issue of documents for the civil
contract, details of which were dependent on the type of pumping equipment
to be supplied. As a result, work on the main civil contract started two
months late, in September ±980.



-6-
Revisions
3.03      There was only one major revision in the design of the project.
The original project provided for a new 200 mm pipeline from the old
boreholes in Francistown to the existing ground level storage reservoir,
where mixing with the treated water from Shashe would take place. A cost
analysis study carried out shortly after the award of the civil contract
showed that it would be advantageous to reroute the borehole 200 mm
pipeline to join the Shashe/Francistown pipeline about 2 km before the
storage tank, and to increase the size of the last 2 km of the main pipe
from 350 mm to 400 mm. The route as constructed is shown on the map at the
end of this report.
3.04      In the original design for the main pumping station at Shashe,
the consultants provided for horizontal shaft centrifugal pumps. During
the protracted discussion on the bidding document specifications referred
to in para. 3.02 above, the Bank recommended that bidders be permitted to
quote for alternative types of pump. One bidder quoted as an alternative,
vertical shaft turbine pumps, which on evaluation were shown to be
marginally lower in cost over the life of the project than any of the other
bids. The contract was therefore awarded on this basis. However, use of
vertical shaft turbine pumps involved redesigning the pumphouse and
filtered water storage arrangements, and changes in the arrangements for
backwashing the filters. The use of vertical shaft turbine pumps also
resulted in increased construction costs and contractual claims for delay.
Implementation Schedule
3.05      The original implementation schedule showed completion of the
works by December 31, 1981. This was a tight schedule aimed at meeting the
peak demand in the summer months, December to February, as there was a
serious water shortage in Francistown. In the light of subsequent events
it is possible the project could have been completed on time if it had been
constructed to the consultants original specifications. The fact that it
was not, was due partly to the delay in awarding contracts due to the
changes to bidding documents required by the Bank, and the subsequent
changes in design of civil works as a result of the use of vertical turbine
pumps instead of the horizontal shaft centrifugal pumps originally
specified by the consultants.
3.06      Supplies of water were first delivered to Francistown from the
Shashe treatment works via a temporary cross connection direct into the
Francistown distributing mains on May 13, 1982, approximately four and one
half months late. The works were substantially complete and in full
operation by August 31, 1982, but a considerable amount of finishing-off
remained to be completed during the maintenance period, some of which is
still outstanding but which is expected to be completed by end of February
1984. Great difficulty has been experienced in getting the main pumping
equipment supplier from South Africa to finish off the minor outstanding
details of his contract. One reason for this may be the demands being made
on the services of pumping equipment suppliers in South Africa due to the
severe drought conditions affecting the area in the last year or two.
3.07      No major problems were experienced with Part B of the project for
investigation and design of the Gaborone Dam raising. Minor problems



- 7 -
caused by unexpected stone sizes in the dam, unexpected hardness of rock in
some boreholes, and the need to take out more trial pits and an additional
borehole caused a delay of one month in completing the field work.
Nevertheless the final report was completed one month ahead of the
scheduled date of December 31, 1981.
Procurement
3.08      Part A of the project was divided into three main supply and
erect contracts, A civil contract including supply of the main pipeline
and storage tank, and two equipment contracts for the main pumping station
and the treatment works. The procedure followed was in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines. Of 22 firms from 6 different countries who on applied
for prequalification questionaires for the civil contract, 12 applied for
prequalification, 7 of whom were prequalified. With one exception, all the
nine bids for the two equipment contracts were from South African firms.
In fact of the 31 firms who requested tender documents, 24 were South
African. It is doubtful in these circumstances whether international
bidding procedures conferred any real benefit on the borrower.
3.09      In the case of a small contract for about US$20,000 for
communications equipment, the Bank agreed to this being negotiated with a
firm which had already supplied communication equipment to WUC. The reason
being partly because of the need to have matching equipment but also
because of the total lack of facilities in Botswana for maintenance of
other suppliers equipment.
Costs and Disbursements
3.10      Total costs of the project were US$6.667 million equivalent
compared with an appraisal estimate of US$6.265 million--an increase of
6.4%. During the period of construction 1980-84 the exchange rate changed
from a high of US$1.3 to the Pula in 1981 to a low of US$0.91 to the Pula
in 1983. In terms of Pula, the cost of Part A of the project (Francistown
Water Supply) was 15.2% above the appraisal estimate. The increase was
accanmmodated in the local currency loan to WUC from the government (para.
2.10 (ii)) and a Pula equivalent appreciation in the value of the dollar
loan which partially off-set the Pula cost increases. A breakdown of costs
is given in Annex 1. The large difference between the actual (15%) and
estimated (68%) proportions of foreign to local costs is because both the
civil contractor and the consultants were registered in Botswana and
were paid in local currency.
3.11      Most of the increase in cost was due to an increase of about 100%
in labor costs in Botswana during the construction period, and a high rate
of inflation in South Africa. Provision for price contingencies covered
only about 70% of the actual increase and resulted in a substantial
underestimation.
3.12      There was a considerable saving in the main pipeline costs due to
the use of reducing grades of asbestos cement pipes for the last 13 kms
instead of steel, with pressure relief valves at the junctions.
3.13      Cost of Part B of the project was about 14% above the estimated
cost due mainly to additional site investigation works (para. 3.07) and the
escalation of labor costs.



-8-
3.14      A schedule comparing actual with estimated disbursements is given
in Annex 2. Disbursement was slow due mainly to delay in forwarding
applications by the Government, and in one case in FY83, by loss of
documents in the post. The revised closing date for the loan was June 30,
1984 but final payments to contractors continued up to early 1985.
Operations
3.15      The project had been in service for a period of 20 months at the
time of the PCR mission, initially as the principal source of treated water
for Francistown, and more recently as the sole source whilst rehabilitation
of the old borehole facilities is being undertaken. There have been very
few interruptions to the supply and the project as a whole has proved very
reliable. However, there have been many minor problems due to pumping
equipment and instrumentation failing to fully meet specifications, and a
reluctance on the part of the supplier to rectify these matters promptly,
and finish off the works. These have been subsequently corrected.
3.16      Two low lift Archimedes screw pumps at the intake from Shashe Dam
had cracked shafts after a short period of operation and had to be returned
to the manufacturer for repair. Although now working again, their
efficiency is below specification. However, these pumps will only be
required to operate in the rare event of the water in the Shashe Reservoir
falling to a very low level. Their efficiency is therefore not a matter of
critical Importance. Excessive noise from the three main pump motors
necessitated their return to the manufacturers for modification. Since
there is, at this stage of development, spare pumping capacity their return
to the manufacture for modification, one by one, did not involve any
interruption of supplies to Francistown. The pumps supplying the Dumela
Industrial area as designed based on the Bank's requirements, proved to be
unsuitable for the purpose and have now been replaced by the manufacturer
with pumps of a different type. An alternative arrangement relying on
partial gravity feed had been devised by WUC and this meets the current
demand.
3.17      Most, if not all the problems with pumps and instruments might
have been avoided by closer supervision by the borrower's agents during the
manufacturing stage. In this case the consultants employed an agent in
South Africa to carry out the inspections and witness tests at the
manufacturers works, and this was evidently not done satisfactorily. As a
result of this experience the Consultants are now carrying out inspections
on later contracts with their own staff.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors, Suppliers and Borrower
3.18      Performance of the consultants was good with the exception of
their inspection and witnessing of tests of goods in manufacture, where
they seem to have been badly let down by their agent. Their initial design
for the project was a simple, straightforward installation using equipment
of a type with which WUC was already familiar. The Bank's insistence on
opening up of the equipment specifications to alternative designs put
forward by the suppliers, reference is made to the main pumping station at
Shashe, para. 3.04, and Dumela pumps, para. 3.16, resulted in a
considerable amount of redesign work for the civil contract and was a
material factor in delaying completion of the project.



-. 9 -
3.19      Difficulties were encountered with respect to the performance of
the three main contractors. All of them were dependent on their South
African principals for their resources of men and material. From tlhe
outset all three had difficulty in obtaining their requirements because of
competing demands from their principal's other act'-ities in South Africa,
where something approaching boom conditions existed in the construction
industry. Frequent changes in supervisory staff had to be made due to
inexperience or incompetance. Coordination was lacking between the main
contractors and their sub-contractors, and in the case of equipment
suppliers deliveries were often late and piecemeal with ro proper
coordination, resulting in much time being wasted on locating        missing
items. The impression was given by all three contractors that due to
other commitments in South Africa, the project was of low priority in
their work programs. Deduction of liquidated damages from progress
payments seems to have had little effect. Remedial works to correct
deficiencies sometimes had to be redone because they, too, were
unsatisfactory. However, in spite of the difficulties and delays the
project as constructed is of a satisfactory standard apart from some
relatively minor cosmetic deficiencies.
3.20      Relations between the Borrower, the Beneficiary, the Consultants
and the Bank were at all times excellent. The Beneficiary (the WUC) is a
small, highly efficient, compact organization with a dedicated staff
determined to maintain the highest possible standards.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Market
4.01      The lack of historical data coupled with the effect of former
frequent restrictions in supply and other factors make demand forecasting
for the Francistown area a very subjective exercise. The known projected
developments, even coupled with the accelerating development of the town
and the Government's policy of diverting industries from other areas with
severe water problems to Francistown, do indicate however, a slower growth
of demand for water than that envisaged at the time of project appraisal.
The following table shows the actual and current forecast sales in
megalitres per annum by the WUC, compared with the appraisal estimates.

4.02      On the basis of the above estimates additional pumping capacity
and additions to the treatment works at Shashe will be required to increase
the system capacity from 8,000 m3/day to 12,000 m3/day in 1987/88 instead
of in 1989/90, estimated at the time of appraisal. The system would be
operating at full capacity of 12,000 m3/day in 1990 instead of in 1995/96.
This more rapid loading of the facilities is estimated to be reflected in
improved financial results, as shown in Annex 3. Tariffs were increased
from an average of 38 thebe/kilolitre in 1981/82 to an average of 60 thebe
in 1982/83 and 74 thebe in 1983/84. These large increases do not seem to
have had any noticeable effect in supressing demand, and in fact further
annual increases up to 110 thebes/kilolitre in 1988 are planned.
4.03      It is difficult to be precise as to the incremental sales
attributable to the project. In the year before Shashe water became
available, sales in Francistown were 1005 megalitres, but this was an
unreliable and heavily polluted supply, which has rnow been relegated to the
status of an emergency source and is in effect obsolete. An analysis of
pumping costs has shown that water from the Shashe source cost less in
Francistown than water from the boreholes in the town, the main reason
being that standard power costs at the boreholes are 5.5 times those at
Shashe which benefits from the BCL special tariff. This benefit was not
apparently foreseen in the appraisal report. Boreholes will, however, form
an essential part of the Francistown supply as demand grows.
4.04      The secondary benefits of the project are very considerable but
are in the main unquantifiable. For example, a heavily polluted restricted
and unreliable water supply has been replaced by a reliable unrestricted
supply of clean palatable water with capacity, for expansion to seven times
the present demand. Improvements in the towns secondary distribution and
the mode of operation have reduced system losses to about 11% (previously
estimated at over 30%). One of the spin-offs of the project has been the
opportunity it has provided the Government to direct new industries to the
town, which might otherwise have been lost to Botswana because of the acute
water shortages in Gaborone and elsewhere. In the three years 1981 through
1983, twenty new industries ranging from cosmetics and garments, to
plastics and autospares, employing about 850 people, commenced operations
in Francistown. Another seven industries employing nearly 700 people had
license applications under consideration in September 1983. An additional
spin-off was the training of a number of WUC technicians in construction
procedures. These trainees who had already attended full-time technical
training courses in Swaziland under the sponsorship of WUC, were attached
to the consultants for a period of one year each, during construction of
the project.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01      WUC's appraisal forecast and actual income statements, balance
sheets and sources and application of funds statements for the Francistown
undertaking are shown in Annex 3, pages 1 to 3. The results are broadly in
line with the appraisal report projections up to the year ending March 31,
1983, in spite of a lower volume of sales due to delay in completing the
project. From 1983 onwards results are expected to be better than forecast
because of higher tariffs and a substantially higher than forecast growth
of demand (pars. 4.01).



- 11 -
Income Statements
5.02      WUC's financial objectives as defined in the financial covenants
of the Project Agreement were:
(a) to maintain tariffs at a level sufficient to earn an annual rate
of return on revalued assets of not less than 11X in 1981, 0% in
the years 1982 through 1984, 1% in 1985, 2% in 1986 and 3%
thereafter; and
(b) to limit additional debts in local currency to Pula 55,000 per
annum.
5.03      The above objectives have been met by WUC in all years to date.
A tariff increase of 50% was introduced in FY83 and a further increase of
23% in FY84. The latter increase is expected to enable the undertaking to
earn a rate of return of 1.2% in FY84 compared with 0% required by the
covenant. It is WUC's present policy to progressively increase tariffs in
excess of those specifically required by the loan covenant in order to
generate cash for local development expenditures. Current forecasts expect
the average tariff to rise from the current 74 thebes/kilolitre to 110 1/
thebes/kilolitre in 1988 by which time the rate of return is expected to be
7.4%. An increase to 85 thebes/kilolitre, effective April 1984, has
already been approved by Government. Tariff increases of approximately 95%
since 1980 have kept well ahead of inflation which over the past four years
(1981 thru 1984) has totalled about 68% as measured by the urban cost of
living index.
5.04      WUC's tariff charges are different for each of the four separate
accounting areas of Gaborone, Lobatee, Shashe and Francistown. Overall
they reflect the costs of supply and are governed by Bank loan covenants
which require WUC to earn a rate of return of 8% on revalued assets at
Gaborone and Lobatse, and 8% on historically valued assets at Shashe.
Details of the current tariffs are given in Annex 4 from which it will be
seen that the first 10 kilolitres per month and the supply to standpipes is
at a low rate well below the cost of supply. In 1983 for Francistown it
was about 40% of the cost of supply excluding interest on capital. This
social tariff for small consumers and low-income category housing areas, is
subsidized entirely by higher charges to larger consumers.
5.05      Operating costs have been higher than expected due largely to
higher than estimated costs of power for pumping. These costs were more
than compensated for by increased revenue due to higher tariffs
(para. 5.03) with the net result that the operating ratio was better than
expected.
5.06      Section 19 of the Water Utilities Corporation Act requires the
WUC to earn a reasonable return on the capital employed, and in defining
the term "reasonable return" mentions that net income should be sufficient
among other things to make dividend payments to Government in respect of
its equity interest in WUC. The Government has an equity interest of about
Pula 90,000 in respect of the Gaborone/Lobatse undertaking on which WUC is
currently paying an annual dividend of 7%.
1/ Te current average tariff inforce for 1986/87 is 132 thebe/kilolitre.



- 12 -
Balance Sheets
5.07      Because of the delay in completion of the project (para. 3.06)
net plant in operation was substantially below the estimates until 1983,
after which it is expected to increase much faster than estimated in the
appraisal report due to the accelerated growth of demand (para. 4.01) and
the consequential need to develop the distribution system and upgrade the
old groundwater sources. Since these developments will be financed by
revenue surpluses and capital contributions from consumers, the debt/equity
ratio will improve earlier than forecast.
5.08      Considering the poor shape of the Francistown undertaking when
taken over by WUC, with many consumers having unmetered suppliers, the
appraisal estimate of receivables at 10% of annual revenue in the first
years of operation was unrealistic. However, they have already been
reduced from 55% in 1980 to 38% in 1983 and are expected to be reduced to
about 14% from now on. Receivables for WUC's other areas of supply
(Gaborone, Lobatse and Shashe) were 9.7% in 1983.
5.09      Revaluation of assets has been based on the urban cost of living
index for Botswana, issued by the Government.  A 10% average for future
years has been assumed compared with 9% in the appraisal report.  Actual
inflation from 1981 to 1983 as measured by the government index has been
43% compared with 19% assumed in the appraisal report.
Source and Application of Funds
5.10      Internal sources of finance were slightly less than anticipated
in 1981 and 1982 in spite of higher tariffs, due mainly to the higher than
expected operating costs (para. 5.05). However, from 1984 onwards internal
sources are expected to exceed the estimates and should provide all the
funds required for renovation and rapid expansion of the Francistown
undertaking until about 1989, when it will be necessary to develop an
additional major source of raw water (para. 4.02).
5.11      Construction expenditures for the project have been financed
entirely by the loans from the Bank and the Government as intended.
Due to the more rapid growth of demand and consequential expansion of the
distribution system, which is expected to be financed entirely from
internal sources (para. 5.10), the debt service coverage at 1.2 in 1983
rising to 2.2 in 1985, will be somewhat better than anticipated. The WUC
is largely protected by the Government against currency fluctuations, as
provided for in the side letter to the subsidiary agreement (para. 2.05).
5.12      The WUC has met all its financial targets to date and is expected
to do so in future. Its accounts are well kept and in the four years
following the Prancistown taken over, have been certified correct without
qualification, within four months of the end of each financial year.
Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
5.13      The economic rate of return of the project is the discount rate
at which the present value of capital and operating costs, excluding duties
and taxes, is equal to the present value of benefits attributable to the
investments over the economic life of the project. Capital and operating
costs and benefits associated with the increase of system capacity to



- 13 -
12,000 m3 per day have been included in the cost and benefit streams.
Incremental water revenues have been used as the best proxy for benefits
attributable to the investments. Further revenues have been based on
tariff increases already approved and planned. On this basis the economic
rate of return on Part A of the project in terms of 1980 prices is 11.7%
compared with 11% forecast in the appraisal report. Details are set out in
Annex 5.  The improvement is due to a higher rate of growth in demand and
to larger increases in tariffs than those foreseen at the time of
appraisal. The principal factors affecting the accelerated growth in
demand were:
(a) an influx of immigrants from Zimbabwe; and
(b) the acute water shortage in Gaborone and other parts of the
country which led to diversion of new industries to Francistown
(para. 4.04).
The economic rate of return would be higher than 13.1% if the
unquantifiable health, environmental and social benefits could have been
included along with the net benefits from new industries which would have
been lost to Botswana (at least for some years) had the project not been
constructed.
Covenants
5.14      The Borrower and the Beneficiary have met all the covenants in
the Loan and Project Agreements in full and without difficulty.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Manaement and Oganization
6.01      A high degree of efficiency in WUC management has been maintained
through two changes in the Chief Executive (both expatriate) since
appraisal of the project. Some changes in the organization were introduced
with the addition of the Francistown undertaking. The present organization
is shown in Annex 6 and includes positions for Jwaneng undertaking which is
scheduled to be taken over by WUC in 1984. The present establishment has
394 posts of which 20 are filled by expatriates in the absence of any
suitably qualified local individuals.  This compares with 344 posts
including 19 expatriates at the time of appraisal in 1979. All expatriates
are on two-year contracts, which may be extended by one year or renewed for
two years as the need arises. There is, however, a high turnover and none
of the present expatriates were on the staff in 1979. There is only one
professional Botswana on the staff; he occupies the post of Principal
Administrative Officer. There are no Botswana in any of the technical or
accounting professional posts.
6.02      The lack of professional Botswana staff has not created any
problems so far. Suitably qualified expatriates have been available on
two-year contracts, but the total absence of a pipeline of potential
candidates for the senior technical and accounting positions and the high
turnover of expatriates is disquieting.  Part of the problem lies in the
schools' curricula which do not provide a sound basis for engineering

training. Students sent under the Staff Training Scheme to a waterworks
operators course at the Swaziland College of Technology are said to have
been unable to benefit fully from it because of their lack of basic
training in the sciences. Training of accountants to sub-accountant level
at the Botswana Institute of Administration and Commerce has been more
successful, but there have been losses due to more attractive salary scales
in local industry.
6.03      It is the corporation's policy to localize all positions in the
establishment as soon as possible and to further this aim it appointed a
consultant to carry out a review of the corporation's future manpower
requirements, prepare job descriptions and training programs and review
salary scales in the context of other employers in Botswana. A sum of
US$300,000 was included in the Third Water Supply Project, Loan 2333-BT
(para. 1.07) to cover the cost of this study and the first stage of a
senior staff development program. Unless, however, the Government takes
steps to improve the basic training in sciences at primary and secondary
levels, it will be difficult for WUC to make much headway in training local
candidates for professional engineering positions.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Achievements
7.01      The project achieved all its objectives and more.  It met the
existing demand and provided for future growth up to seven times the
present demand. It replaced an inefficient unreliable supply of poor
quality water with a reliable supply of clean water and an efficient
organization to deal with expansion and consumers' requirements. It also
provided an unforseen benefit by averting the loss of new industries to
Botswana on account of the severe water shortages in other areas.
Least-cost Alternative
7.02      The consultants who prepared the engineering studies in 1977
showing that the Shashe source was the least-cost solution for supplies to
Francistown, have reviewed their original calculations in the light of the
actual construction costs. These show that the actual cost of the pipeline
and pumping stations in 1977 prices is less than the estimated cost used in
the comparison with alternative schemes, confirming the original conclusion
that the project is the least-cost solution.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
General
8.01      In general the Bank's performance was good.  However, on the
procurement issue the Bank became involved in considerable discussion with
the consultants on details of design which delayed the project by some
months and caused some increase of costs. The net result of the Bank's
intervention into the design aspects was a final installation substantially
different from the consultants' original design and the one preferred by



- 15 -
the borrower, but with marginalcost advantages only. The consultant's
original design was a simple one using pumping equipment of a *ype already
in use on WUC installations, whereas the final installation utilizes
equipment requiring a higher degree of skill in maintenance. So long as
highly skilled expatriates are available for maintenance this may not be a
matter of concern, but this situation is likely to change well before the
end of the equipment's useful life. With hindsight it might have been
better to accept the consultant's original proposals which seem to have
been well suited to the skills likely to be available to WUC over tht life
of the project. There is little doubt that Bank involvement in the design
ultimately resulted in some cost increases as well as operational problems
with the Dumela pumping.
Supervision
8.02      Active supervision of the project works (Part A of the Project)
by Bank staff ceased with a mission in September 1981 when the project was
about 60% complete. Staff constraints were the reason for lack of
supervision missions thereafter. However, supervision of the WUC's general
performance continued through preparation and appraisal of the third water
project. It is doubtful whether further Bank missions could have
contributed anything more to the successful completion of the project than
that already provided by the consultants--except perhaps in expediting
applications for disbursements.
Working Relationships
8.03      Cooperation and frank exchange of information between the WUC,
the various ministries in Government and the Bank were excellent at all
times. Relations between Bank staff and the WUC's consultants were also
good in spite of some initial strain due to professional differences of
opinion regarding project design.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      The project achieved all its objectives by replacing a restricted
rundown, unreliable, and contaminated water supply in Francistown with an
unrestricted and reliable supply of clean treated water for many years to
come, and at the same time preparing the way for the third water project.
Financially the results have been better than expected and are likely to
continue so. Moreover, the Government is now in a position to divert new
industries to the Francistown area thus relieving the pressure on the water
resources of the Gaborone area.
9.02      If there is a lesson to be learned from this project, it is that
where an efficient and experienced agency initiates and designs a project
with the aid of reputable consultants having the benefit of local knowledge
and experience, the Bank should hesitate to initiate changes unless there
are manifestly good reasons for doing so. In this case the estimated
marginal financial benefits resulting from the changes initiated by the
Bank have to be weighed against the unquantifiable costs of delay in
completing the project. Moreover, if the agency and their consultants'
judgement was sound in choosing the original design, even the estimated
marginal financial benefits may prove to be ephemeral.

9.03      The benefits deriving from the project are to a great extent
dependent on continuing good management and skilled maintenance, at present
provided by expatriates on two-year contracts. Some difficulty has already
been experienced in recruiting and retaining expatriates due to
uncompetitive remuneration and high rates of inflation in Botswana. It
will take a minimum of four years for sponsored students to reach graduate
level at universities and further training will then be necessary in WUC
before they will be able to adequately fill the professional posts now
occupied by expatriates. A sense of urgency in this matter seems to be
lacking. Future Bank lending in the water, urban and education sectors
should be directed towards helping the Government and WUC to correct this
situation.

Dear Mr Shields,
Re: Project Completion Report on Botswana -
Second Water Supply Project (Loan 1763-BT)
1.    Mr Commander and I thank you for your letter of May 22nd 1986 which
we received here on the 4th June 1986.  We have a few comments to make
which we have detailed below, and if it would be of help these could
be incorporated in the text of the PCR.
2.    We are generally  in  agreement with  the Report but  there are one or
two errors  in detail which we suggest amerding, and one omission i.e.
Page 1, para. 1.02 'The Sector'.
(a)    The Corporation was not created to take over the water supplies
to the Gaborone/Lobatse area but was required to do so within
a short-time.
(b)    The  Debswana  mine  management  were  responsible  for  the  water
supplies to Jwaneng until the Corporation assumed responsibility,
not the DWA.
(c)    The  Corporation  is  already  responsible  for  the  public  water
supplies to all major townships in Botswana with the exception
of Orapa.
3.    Page 2 para. 1.07 'Bank Involvement in the Sector'
Suggest details of the project include 'construction of service reservoirs
and pumping stations'.
4.    Page 6 para. 3.04 'Revisions'
(a)    The use of vertical shaft turbine pumps also resulted in increased
construction costs and contractural claims for delay.
(b)    The other error which occurred which is omitted from the PCR,
is the fact that the Bank also insisted that the Dumela Industrial
Area pumps be reduced in capacity. This was eventually reluctantly
carried out, but the pumps were inadequate to meet demand and
because of this have never been used.  An alternative arrangement
had to be devised, utilising the main booster pumping sets and
partial gravity  feed from the high level reservoir to meet the
demands of the Area.   This excessive interference in the details
of project design pointed out earlier in the Report - page -



ANNI   6
- 26 -                             page 2 of 3
-V-  'Highlights'  -  fourth paragraph, relative to the vertical
shaft turbine pumps, *ws also pertinent to the Dumela pumps,
and resulted in abortive expenditure.
S.   Page 8 para. 3.16 'Operations'
We suggst that mention  be made of the problem relating to the Dumela
pumps also in thia paragraph.
6.   Page  8  para.  3.18  'Performance of Consultants. Contractors. Suppliers
and Borrower'
We suggest that mention again be made of the Dumela problem in this
paragraph.
7,   Page 10 paras. 4.01 and 4.02 'Operating Performance'
(a) Actual results to date indicate that the growth in water sales in Francis-
town has not occurred to the extent anticipated in earlier forecasts.
(See  also  comment under Financial Performance  below).   The  current
WUC forecast has therefore scaled down the figures of estimated sales
to a point where they are now more in line with the appraisal estimates.
(b)    Page 10 para. 4.03
Slight variation in the wording of the PCR is suggested as the
boreholes are only temporarily not in use.   They will form an
essential part of the Francistown supply as demand grows.
8.    Pages 10/11 paras. 5.01, 5.03 and S.06 'Financial Performance'
(a)    The  figures  shown  under  the heading of  'Current Forecast'  in
the Income Statements Source and Application of Funds Statement
etc, pages 1 and 2 of the Annex 3 to the Report, are in fact
drawn from the forecast which was prepared in January 1984.
The forecast is revised annually and although it is not suggested
that the most recent figures be substituted at this stage, it
should be borne in mind that the estimates shown are 2 years
out of date. For example paragraph 5.03 states that 'current
forecasts expect the average tariff to rise - to 110
thebe/kilolitre by  1988'.   In fact the current average tariff
in force for 1986/87 is 132 thebe/kilolitre.
(b)    The equity interest of P90 000 referred to relates to Gaborone/-
Lobatse Undertaking rather than Francistown. (para. 5.06)
9.    Pages 14/15 para. 8.01 'Bank Performance'
(a)    Suggest mention be made of increased costs due to design changes.
(b)    Suggest that the wording include a note on the abortive expenditure
on the Dumela pumps.
10.   Pages lb/16 paras. 9.02 and 9.03 'Conclusions'
(a)    para. 9.02

from changes in the design of the Shashe pumps and abortive
expenditure on the Dumela pumps.
(b)    para. 9.03

qualifications and will be leaving to take full time courses
overseas at the end of June 1986.   The other two are graduate
engineers and are being groomed to become Chartered Civil Engineers.
It is proposed to recruit more graduates from the University
of  Botswana  during  1986.    The amount  set aside  for training
in the Corporation's Annual Budget has increased sharply over
the past  two  years.    It must be  borne  in mind however, that
having assisted staff to attain professional status they may
be tempted away from the Corporation by the prospect of greater
rewards in terms of both salary and fringe benefits in the Private
Sector, even though they are 'bonded'.
11.   We  trust  that these comments will be of assistance.   They are being
sent to you by courier so that you receive them as requested by 18
June 1986.
Yours sincerely,
C   Sayles
-           ~~~Chief Executive
