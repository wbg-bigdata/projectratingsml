I. THE ECONOMIC SETTING
Introduction
1.01      Peru, the fourth largest country in Latin America, has a total
area of 1,280,000 km2, divided by the Andes Mountains into three regions
with extreme topographic and climatic contrasts. Along the 3,000 km of
the Pacific coastline there is a narrow strip of flat and dry land (the
Costa) covering only 11% of the country's total area but containing the
major cities and nearly half of the total population. The Andean Highlands
(the Sierra) above 2,000 meters, cover 26% of the country, are composed of
steep mountain slopes and high valleys, and account for 44% of the country's
population.   East of the Sierra are vast tropical lowlands (the Selva),
covering the remaining 63% of the country but containing only 10% of the
population. The rugged topography limits trade and integration between the
three regions of Peru, and modern economic activity has concentrated in the
Costa. Thus, the main coastal cities account for well over 80% of industrial
activity and commercial bank credit, with the bulk of it concentrated in Lima.
1.02      The natural resource base holds both major opportunities and
constraints to Peru's future development. Vast mineral resources are the
largest asset, aad mining will remain the backbone of the economy as a source
of savings and foreign exchange, although it provides little direct employment
and may have, for a period of time, few linkages with the rest of the economy.
A major resource constraint is the scarcity and poor quality of agricultural
lands. The population pressure on agricultural land is high, and the only new
lands that could be brought into production are limited areas in the upper Selva
and, with extensive irrigation and drainage, some valleys in the Costa. Energy
is also a potential constraint, as with the current proven oil reserves the
country might become a net oil importer by 1985. A third potential natural
resource problem is water, as the long term needs of the area west of the Andes
will require water transfers from the eastern side of the mountains at a very
high cost.
Major Economic Activities
1.03      During the past twelve years, the Peruvian economy has gone through
a period of rapid growth fueled by expasionary fiscal and credit policies
from 1968 to 1976, a serious financial and balance of payments crisis,
followed by a recessionary period from 1977 to 1979, and the incipient
stages of an economic recovery, started in late 1979. The cyclical nature
of the economic activity during the 1970s is reflected in the growth of GDP,
which averaged 4.7% p.a. during the 1965-1976 period, dropping to minus 1.5%
p.a. in 1977-78. Preliminary data suggest a modest increase in 1979 of 3.4%.
I'he sectoral distribution of economic activity changed substantially during
the 1960s and early 1970s, and stabilized after 1976 except for a continuing
increase in the share of mining. At present, the largest contribution to GDP
is that of manufacturing, accounting for about 26% of the total, followed by
agriculture with 14% and mining with 10%. With economic stagnation and a
rapidly growing population (2.7 percent p.a.), the country's per capita income
fell considerably during the late 1970s, and was $730 in 1979. The recent



- 2 -
economic crisis and the high rate of growth of population have worsened a
traditionally serious unemployment problem, and it is estimated that 11% of
the non-agricultural labor force is currently unemployed and 44% is under-
employed. 1/
Recent Developments
1.04      Since 1976 there were successive Government efforts to cope with the
economic crisis, but it was only after mid-1978 that an effective stabilization
program was carried on and the basis for economic recovery was established.
In addition to accelerating the devaluation of the sol, the Government adopted
a short-term stabilization package including a reduction in the fiscal deficit,
an increase in interest rates and a refinancing of the external debt. This
program was supported by a stand-by arrangement with the IMF. At the same time,
the Government prepared an Economic Recovery Program (ERP) which included, in
addition to the stabilization measures, a package of medium and long-term
policy measures to open up the economy, stimulate industrial sector efficiency,
promote non-traditional exports, strengthen the tax system and generally
improve the efficiency of resource allocation in the private and public
sectors. The ERP was supported by a Bank Program Loan (Loan 1693-PE).
Progress in carrying out the ER.P was generally satisfactory, and was an
important factor leading to the improved economic performance in 1979.
1.05      The economic team of the new Government, inaugurated on July 28,
1980, is firmly committed to the continuation, and in some cases acceler-
ation, of the policies initiated under the ERP. Such policy would help
reduce the high rate of inflation (averaging about 60% in 1980) as the
lower levels of protection would increase competition from imports (and reduce
the expansionary impact of the balance of payments surplus), whereas the
exchange rate policy would help employment creation and would prevent the
inflow of short-term foreign capital that might otherwise follow the increase
in interest rates. The Government has already started to take action on
several of the areas above, including a first round of reductions in tariffs,
the elimination of non-tariff barriers to imports, an increase in interest
rates, and the acceleration of the rate of devaluation.
II. THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
Past Performance
2.01      Industrialization in Peru during the 1950s and 1960s proceeded
along the path of import substitution common to most Latin American countries.
The market orientation of the different economic sectors was clearly defined,
with mining and most of agriculture being fully export-oriented, while indus-
try was to gradually replace trade as the supplier of consumer goods for the
growing domestic market. Under a constantly increasing level of tariff pro-
tection, the manufacturing sector grew substantially. Its share in the
country's GDP increased from about 20% in the mid-1950s, to about 25% in 1968.
Consumer products for the domestic market accounted for two-thirds of the
sector's total output, while manufactured exports accounted for only 0.5% of
gross manufacturing output and less than 2% of total exports.

2.02      After 1968, the Government attached a new role to the manufac-
turing sector, which was considered the main force of the development pro-
cess, and its overall policy environment changed accordingly. Increasing
volumes of public resources were shifted towards manufacturing, the role
of foreign enterprises was sharply reduced, public sector ownership of
industrial firms expanded rapidly, workers' participation in ownership and
management of privately-owned firms was introduced, and strong support was
given to new forms of enterprises. Basic industries (mainly steel, chemicals,
fertilizers, cement and paper) were reserved for government ownership, and
the remaining subsectors were tightly controlled through allocation of inputs,
channeling of credit, tax and other incentives and investment planning.
2.03      The development of the Peruvian industrial sector during the early
1970s continued to be mostly inward oriented. While the first policy measures
to promote non-traditional exports were passed in 1968 (and started to operate
in 1970), the beginning of an export promotion policy coincided with two other
developments in economic policy which worked in the opposite direction. These
were the adoption of a policy of full protection of domestic industry from
foreign competition through non-tariff barriers and the adoption of a policy
of fixed exchange rate which resulted in a constantly increasing overvaluation
of the sol from 1970 to 1975.
2.04      Manufacturing value added grew substantially during the early
1970s, with average growth rates of 6.6% p.a. from 1969 to 1974, well above
the also high average annual growth of GDP during the same period (4.8%).
Industrial growth was induced mainly by sharply growing domestic demand
for industrial products, fueled by the Government's expansionary fiscal
and credit policies. However, as a result of these policies, aggregate
demand considerably exceeded aggregate supply, which in turn led to widen-
ing external gaps and strong inflationary pressures, with a resulting loss
of international reserves and a massive build-up of external debt. Industrial
growth dropped from 11.0% in 1974 to 4.0% in 1975 and 1976. The economic
crisis accelerated in 1977 and by mid-1978 it had reached grave proportions,
with a drop in GDP and an acceleration of inflation to an annual rate of 100%.
In this environment, and given the industrial sector's strong dependence on
imported inputs, the severity of the foreign exchange crisis, and the fall in
domestic demand, industrial output fell for two consecutive years, by 4.3% in
1977, and 3.5% in 1978. Following the successful implementation of the
stabilization and recovery programs, the economy resumed growth in 1979, and
manufacturing value added grew by about 4%. In 1980, the recovery continued,
with manufacturing sector growth of 6% well above an estimated 3-4% growth of
GDP.
Structure of MIanufacturing
2.05      The Peruvian manufacturing sector is relatively diversified, with
a substantial proportion of manufacturing value added originating outside the
traditional consumer goods industries. The share of food, beverages and
tobacco, clothing and footwear, furniture, plastics and other consumer pro-
ducts has been decreasing over time, and in 1978 accounted for 45% of manufac-
turing value added (Table 2.1), whereas the share of intermediate goods
(particularly export-oriented, resource based products such as metal products



-4-
and textiles) has increased in recent years. The decrease in the share of
domestically oriented consumer goods was mostly the result of the 1977-78
crisis and the reduction in domestic demand. Thus, the index of manufacturing
production indicates that in 1979 footwear production was nearly 50% below
the 1976 peak production, and production of most other consumer goods was
also below the production levels prior to the crisis.
Table 2.1. STRUCTURE OF MANUFACTURING VALUE ADDED
1971    1975    1978
Consumer Goods              55.0    55.9    45.0
Intermediate Goods          33.7    30.4    43.0
Capital Goods               11.3    13.7    12.0
TOTAL                 100.0   100.0   100.0
2.06      Industrial enterprises are mostly small.  Two-thirds of the about
10,000 registered industrial establishments 1/ have less than thirty workers.
However, nearly 80% of the sector's value added, and more than two-thirds of
the sector's labor force are in firms with more than 50 employees. The most
recent size distribution of registered enterprises indicates that, in 1975,
there were less than 500 firms employing more than 100 people, and only
12 firms had more than 1,000 workers. The larger scale industrial establish-
ments are concentrated in the chemical and metal processing industries, and
a small number of textile firms have now moved into the larger categories.
The country's largest industrial employer is SIDERPERU, a public sector
steel mill with about 4,600 workers in 1980.
Industrial Employment
2.07      Employment in manufacturing accounts for a small percentage of the
total labor force. Total employment in the formal manufacturing sector is
about 267,000 or less than 5% of the total labor force (Annex 4, T-4).
However, if the informal sector is included, manufacturing accounts for
about 10-12% of total employment. Formal sector employment in manufacturing
has declined somewhat since 1976, with an apparent slight recovery in 1980,
but has not yet returned to its 1976 peak (270,000).
1/   There were 9,634 establishments registered in 1979, excluding the fish
industry.



2.08      In line with the deterioration of the labor market conditions
since 1976, real wages and salaries suffered a severe decline to nearly
half of their peak level. The lowest point was reached in June 1979, but by
Fe!bruary 1980 there had been a slight recovery of about 12%. Total labor
costs to manufacturing enterprises have a relatively high 'social' component
in the form of goods and services (subsidized or free clothing, food, and
recreation facilities) which maintained its real value. Also, labor stability
legislation combined with the drop in output after 1976 resulted in a sharp
decline in productivity and higher labor costs per unit of output than indi-
cated by the fall in real wages and salaries. Peruvian industrial wages and
salaries are in line with comparable countries in Latin America. In February
1980, nominal monthly salaries were about SI. 61,000 (US$240), whereas the
average daily wage was about S/. 1,230 (US$5). If social costs of about 70%
are added, total labor costs would be about US$400 and US$8 respectively, with
variations of 50-60% between large enterprises with more than 100 employees
and small firms with 10-24 employees.
Industrial Location
2,09      Manufacturing activity is heavily concentrated in the metropolitan
area of Lima-Callao which accounts for about 70% of formal sector manufacturing
establishments, employment and output. Other areas with some industrial
agglomeration are Arequipa in the south, and Chimbote, Trujillo and Piura in
ttle north. Most of the import-substituting industrial firms are located in
Lima, where most of the country's purchasing power is concentrated, and
Arequipa is the only other center (much smaller) for light consumer industries.
Major industries outside Lima and Callao are resource-based, including steel
and non-ferrous metal refining close to the mining areas, cotton spinning in
the cotton growing area near Piura, sugar refineries and a large paper mill
using bagasse in the sugar cane growing area of Trujillo, and the fish meal
industry in a number of coastal locations. Decentralization efforts have been
inadequate and uncoordinated, consisting mainly of higher rates in nearly all
industrial incentives (tariff and other tax reductions or exemptions, interest
rate differentials and other). These measures have not effectively counter-
acted the powerful forces which have encouraged concentration: the concen-
tration of domestic demand as well as economic and social infrastructure in
Lima and the infrastructure deficits in all other locations.
Investment
2.10      Investment in manufacturing fluctuated widely during the 1970s.
Fixed investment in formal manufacturing doubled in real terms between 1971
and 1975, but by 1978 it was 25% below its 1975 peak (Annex 4, T-5). The
subsectoral distribution of investment was much more volatile. Between 1971
and 1975 investment in state-dominated industries expanded rapidly and accounted
for the overall investment growth, while investment in industries dominated
by private enterprises declined sharply. Gross fixed capital formation by
public enterprises in the form of industrial machinery and equipment rose from
S/. 0.3 billion in 1971 (about 3% of the total) to S/. 7.9 billion in 1975
(about 40% of the total). After 1975, budget and foreign exchange constraints
led to a sharp decline of public sector industrial investment (to S/. 1.4
billion in 1978 and S/. 1.8 billion in 1979) thus raising the share of private
investment.

Industrial Protection
2.11      Tariff protection in Peru increased constantly during the 1950s and
1960s. While in 1958 the unweighted average of nominal tariffs was 38%, it
increased to 42% in 1964, 55% in 1967 and 69% in 1973. By the latter date,
Peruvian tariff protection was the highest among all Andean Market member
countries. (Table 2.2). Between 1973 and 1979 there were no major changes in
the structure of tariff rates, but the increasing avervaluation of the sol
between 1968 and 1975, and the widespread system of tariff exemptions and
exonerations on industrial inputs and equipment eroded the protection afforded
by the tariff system, which was replaced in this function by a system of
non-tariff barriers after 1970.

2.12      Non-tariff protection operated through a complex system of import
licenses, prohibitions, state monopolies, and, particularly, the National
Register of Manufactures (RNf) established by the General Industries Law of
1070. Import prohibitions applied mainly to luxury consumer products, whereas
the RNM granted unlimited protection to domestically produced goods by prohibit-
ing imports of competitive products. In 1973, out of about 4,600 items in the
Customs Classification (NABANDINA), about 40% were affected by non-tariff
barriers to imports, and by early 1979 the percentage had increased to about
60%, including about 1,400 items in the REM.
2.13      The impact of non-tariff protection on prices of domestically
produced goods was very large, particularly in clothing and textiles. A study
based on a sample of about 100 products subject to import prohibition or
included in the RNM showed that price increases for such products (or very
close substitutes) in the year following the import prohibition (or the
inclusion in the RNM) averaged 40%, ranging from 20% for agricultural products
to &3% for textiles and clothing.  In some cases, such as polyester fibers,
domestic prices in early 1979 ranged between 200-300% of world prices.



2.14      One of the main elements of the 1978 ERP was the reorientation of
industrial policy, including the dismantling of the complex structure of
non-tariff protection to industry, and its replacement by a new tariff system
which could be used flexibly and in a coordinated way with the exchange rate
policy and the system of export incentives, to develop an efficient and
outward-oriented industrial sector. The first measures were taken in March
1979, when the protection granted by the REM was eliminated and a temporary
list of import prohibitions was established (including only 529 items of the
1,437 previously in the RNM) to be gradually reduced aver a two-year period.
Between mid-1979 and mid-1980, the elimination of non-tariff barriers proceeded
rapidly, and in July 1980, only 4% of the items in the NABANDINA list were
subject to such barriers.
2.15      Together with the elimination of non-tariff barriers, the Government
approved, in July 1979, a Decree-Law establishing the principle of a unified
tariff structure, abolishing the complex system of tariff exemptions and
exonerations, and giving authority to the Ministries of Finance and of Industry
to publish a new tariff structure. The new tariff was approved in August 1979,
published in October, and became effective on December 2, 1979 (Annex 4, T-8).
With ad-valorem rates ranging from 0 to 120%, and a still high unweighted
average of 39.5%, the new tariff structure was nevertheless the starting point
in the process of tariff reductions and rationalization to be implemented
over a period of 3 to 4 years. A first round of tariff reductions, leaving
the maximum tariff rate at 60% and reducing the average to 34% was appraved
by the new government in September 1980.
Exchange Rate Policy
2.16      One of the most important elements of economic policy affecting
the Peruvian manufacturing sector during the last decade has been the exchange
rate. Since 1968, Peru's foreign exchange policy has been instrumental
first in establishing a strong dependence on foreign inputs, generating high
(foreign) capital/output ratios and low capacity utilization, and discouraging
exports as a result of an increasing overvaluation of the sol during the
period of fixed exchange rates (from 1968 to 1974), and later in promoting
industrial export growth when a more flexible exchange rate policy was adopted
(after 1976). After substantial improvements in 1977 and 1978, some ground
was lost again in 1979 and the situation remained approximately stationary
during the first half of 1980 (Annex 4, T-7). The new Government accelerated
again the rate of devaluation after July 1980, to compensate for the differential
inflation.
Manufactured Exports and Export Incentives
2.17      As indicated above (paras. 2.01 and 2.03) the development of the
Peruvian manufacturing sector from the 1950s through the mid-1970s was
mostly inward-oriented. In 1976 manufactured exports were US$117 million,
less than 2% of gross manufactured output. In the same year, per capita
manufactured exports in Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, Chile, and
Venezuela averaged US$25, ranging from a high of US$38 (Mexico) to a low of
US$10 (VTenezuela), whereas the corresponding figure for Peru was US$7.
Similar figures for East Asian countries were US$433 in Taiwan and US$185 in
Korei -



-8-
2.18      After 1976, changes in the policy framework, and the severe economic
recession which reduced domestic demand for industrial products resulted in an
unprecedented increase in Peru's manufactured exports, which jumped from
US$117 million in 1976 to more than US$700 million in 1979 (Annex 4, T-6).
After this increase, Peru has 'caught up' with its neighbouring Latin American
countries, exceeding Colombia (whose exports were 3 times above Peru's in
1976) and reaching about two thirds of Chile's manufactured exports. The
amount of per capita manufactured exports in 1979 (US$40) and the share of
exports in manufactured output (about 8%) are still low, but much more in line
with Peru's status as a semi-industrialized country and with its per capita
income level.
2.19      The two main policy changes that triggered the recent increase in
manufactured exports were the more flexible exchange rate policy, starting in
1976 (para. 2.16) and a large increase in the main fiscal incentive to non-
traditional exports, a negotiable tax credit certificate (CERTEX) that had been
introduced in 1970. Since June 1976, exports of non-traditional products
(agricultural, mining and manufactured) have been eligible to receive CERTEX.
The basic CERTEX rates are established on a product-by-product basis, with a
maximum of 30% of the FOB value of exports. Currently they are concentrated
at the higher end of the range. Of the total of about 1,800 products that
have been classified to receive CERTEX, only some 300 products have rates
below 20%. Also, non-traditional exports produced by firms located outside
the Lima-Callao area receive an additional decentralization' CERTEX of 10% of
the FOB value. The total amount of CERTEX granted increased from US$1.8
million in 1970 to US$25 million in 1976 and nearly US$150 million in 1979.
CERTEX has also increased as a percentage of eligible exports, and in 1979,
average CERTEX (including basic and decentralization) was about 22% of total
non-traditional exports and about 30% of eligible exports.
2.20      The very flat structure of CERTEX rates, with most products receiving
about 25% of FOB value, resulted in a large variation in the effective rate Of
subsidy granted to different export products. Thus, the main non-traditional
export products such as canned fish, cotton gray cloth, and cotton yarn,
which are resource-based products, with a low percentage of domestic manufac-
turing value added, received a very high effective rate of subsidy (probably
of between 150 to 200%) 1/, whereas the effective incentive received by
exports of products with high domestic manufacturing value added and highly
protected intermediate inputs such as metal products, light machinery and
fishing boats may be low or even negative. Therefore, it was necessary to
revise the scale of CERTEX rates, to obtain lower and more similar rates of
effective subsidy across products. The Government has recently completed a
review of the operation of the CERTEX system, including the administrative
procedures and is preparing a lower and simplified structure of CERTEX rates.
In addition, gold products, alpaca wool and other semi-processed products have
been recently excluded from the eligible list.
1/   A more extreme example refers to exports of simple gold jewelry where the
combination of high CERTEX rate, an export tax on gold (ingot) and very
low manufacturing value added content may result in effective subsidies
of more than 800%. The high subsidy rates (and probably some fictitious
exports) could help explain the jump iti exports of 'gold products' from
US$20,000 in 1977 to US$340,000 in 1978, and more than US$30 million
in 1979.

Recent Developments
2.21      Peru's new Government has outlined an economic policy program which
includes the completion of the liberalization policy initiated in 1978 (paras.
1.04 and 1.05). The program focusses on the need to eliminate the remaining
non-tariff barriers to imports, reduce import tariffs, create industrial
employment and promote manufactured exports by maintaining an adequate real
exchange rate and an efficient system of export incentives, and encourage
financial savings and efficient resource allocation by maintaining positive
interest rates in real terms. In other areas, the Government is also committed
to (i) promote an increased reliance on the market mechanisms for resource
allocation, and move towards reduced government controls; (ii) review, and
possibly reduce, the Government's direct involvement in manufacturing; (iii)
support the development of small scale enterprises; and (iv) improve the
industrial infrastructure in areas other than Lima-Callao.
2.22      The Government has already started to carry out some of the measures
outlined in the economic program. Thus, the rate of devaluation has been
accelerated to compensate for the differential inflation, and the Central Bank
has approved a substantial increase in interest rates (para. 3.19). All the
remaining administrative barriers to imports were eliminated in August 1980,
including the system of import licenses, and a first round of tariff reductions
took place in September (para. 2.15). Finally, the system of export incentives
is being revised and some administrative reforms and reclassification of
products have already taken place (para. 2.20).
2.23      In recent years, particularly since mid-1978, the Bank has main-
tained a close and continuing dialogue with the Government on industrial
and general economic policies. This dialogue took place mainly in the
context of the preparation and implementation of the ERP supported by the
Program Loan (para. 1.04). During recent months, the economic dialogue
with the new Government has intensified and general economic, industrial
and financial sector review missions have taken place. The proposed project
would provide an appropriate vehicle for continuing the dialogue on industrial
and financial policy issues.
III. THF FINANCIAL SECTOR
Background
:3.01     The Peruvian financial system is dominated by the banking system
which has historically held around 88% of the total assets of the financial
system. Besides the Central Bank (Banco Central de Reserva del Peru), the
banking system comprises Banco de la Nacion (the central Government's bank
and tax collector), other specialized banks and eleven commercial banks. The
non-banking system includes the government's development finance institution,
COFIDE (Corporacion Financiera de Desarrollo), 12 finance companies, 17 savings
and loan associations, 20 insurance companies and several small savings coop-
eratives and credit unions. Peru also has a small but growing securities
exchange which has become increasingly active during the past two years.



- 10 -
3.02      The Government plays an influential role within the Peruvian finan-
cial system. During the early 1970s it introduced several reforms aimed at
strengthening government control of financial institutions, channelling
credit to "strategic" sectors, and improving access to credit of small enter-
prises, beneficiaries of the agrarian reform, and enterprises located outside
the Lima region. The major reform measures included the nationalization of
three commercial banks, the establishment of a Council for Monetary Policy,
the creation of COFIDE and strengthening of the development banks, a new law
regulating the operations of the finance companies, and the channelling
of comercial bank credit to priority sectors and regions. Since 1978, some of
these measures were relaxed and Government guidance of financial institutions
and policies has been considerably reduced. Most importantly, the responsi-
bility for monetary policy was returned to the Central Bank, and channelling
of credit to priority sectors has been phased out. Nonetheless, the Government
continues to exercise much influence in the financial system through the poli-
cies of the Central Bank and the Government-owned financial institutions
which have historically handled about 80% of the total assets of the financial
system.
3.03      The main features of the financial system's recent performance have
been financial disintermediation and the build-up of foreign currency resources.
Negative real interest rates on time and savings deposits and tight monetary
policy since mid-1978 led to overall financial disintermediation, evidenced by
a decline in real terms in the strict and wider definitions of money supply
(M1, M2 and M3) from 1975 to 1979, as well as in total deposits in commercial
banks and total loans outstanding of commercial banks (Annex 4, T-10). On the
other hand, foreign currency deposits increased substantially as a hedge
against inflation and devaluation. They increased from 7.8% of total time and
savings deposits in the banking system in 1977, to 45.1% in 1979.
Main Financial Institutions
3.04      The Central Bank.  Established in 1931, the Banco Central de Reserva
del Peru regulates money supply, credit, and the operations of all financial
intermediaries, and manages international reserves. With the abolition of
the Council for Monetary Policy in June 1978, the Central Bank became again
responsible for monetary policy in cooperation with the Ministry of Economy
and Finance. The Central Bank's main monetary policy instruments are minimum
reserve requirements, discounting facilities and discount rates, and operating
limits for the different financial institutions. Furthermore, until recently,
the Central Bank was authorized to set the structure of interest rates for all
deposits and bonds issued to the public as well as on all loans granted by all
financial intermediaries, but only within the legal maximum established by the
Government. The interest rate law passed in December 1980 (para. 3.19) returns
to the Central Bank full autonomy in setting interest rates. In recent years,
the Central Bank has also operated several special development funds (FONEX,
FIRE, FRAI, and FONCAP) through which it channels funds to priority areas via
onlending by both banking and non-banking institutions (paras. 3.22 to 3.24).



- 11 -
The Banking System
3.105     The banking system includes several specialized banks and eleven
comnmercial banks. The specialized banks are Banco de la Nacion, six regional
banks which operate as commercial banks with a particular focus on promoting
economic development within their respective regions, two construction industry
banks which are limited to financing construction-related activities, a savings
bank, and five Government-owned development banks. All of these institutions
are allowed to accept deposits from the public and all except for the develop-
ment banks rely to an important extent on deposits as a major source of
funds.
3.06      Commercial Banks.  Eleven non-specialized commercial banks in Peru
carry out short-term (i.e. less than one year) banking operations (Annex 4,
T-11). Three of the largest commercial banks were nationalized in 1970 and
placed as "associated" banks under the control of Banco de la Nacion. Never-
theless, these state banks operate under the same legislative regulations as
the other commercial banks. Of the remaining banks, four are private sector
banks and four are branches of foreign banks. Currently these banks maintain
a total of 690 offices, two-thirds of which are located in the Lima area.
During the period from 1975-1979, the commercial banks actually decreased in
size if measured in constant terms and also diminished slightly in relative
importance within the financial system.
3.07      By law, commercial banks are not allowed to extend credits that
exceed one year in maturity. As a consequence, all but one of the domestic
commercial banks have created finance company subsidiaries (financieras) as
vehicles for providing medium-term financing to their clients. The sector
receiving the largest share of commercial bank lending has historically been
the industrial sector, which at year-end 1979 accounted for over 47% of all
commercial banks loans (Annex 4, T-18). The volume of commercial bank lending
has decreased in real terms over the last four years; at year-end 1979 the
volume of outstanding loans stood at only 65% of the 1975 volume, representing
a real decline of about 12% p.a.
3.08      Regional Banks.  The six regional banks operate as commercial
banks with special emphasis on regional development, and are also allowed
to make medium- and long-term loans. They are relatively small, with total
assets of less than 11% of those of the commercial banks (Annex 4, T-14).
Until 1979 (when the program was phased out) the regional banks, along with
the associated banks, were the principal intermediaries for channelling funds
under the Central Bank's selective credit program. Nonetheless, these banks
have experienced a much higher rate of growth in recent years than the
other commercial banks, having grown by 25% in real terms during 1979 as
compared to a 12% real decline for the commercial banks. The structure and
operations of the regional banks are more fully described in Chapter IV.
3.09      Development Banks.  Five state development banks (Annex 4, T-12)
operate as specialized financial intermediaries through which the Government
channels foreign borrowings and resources mobilized through the banking system
to priority sectors, (i.e. industry, agriculture, mining and housing).
Although these banks are authorized to accept deposits, with the exception of
Banco Central Hipotecari-   ethe Central Mortgage Bank), they are not active in
mobilizing funds from the public, relying instead on Central Bank funding and
foreign borrowings.



- 12 -
3.10      Banco Industrial del Peru (BIP) was created to promote the develop-
ment of the industrial sector, particularly small- and medium-scale industry,
through the provision of short- and medium-term financing. The bank also
provides bill discounting, letters of credit, guarantees and other banking
services, although to a lesser extent than the commercial banks. The bank
complements the efforts of COFIDE in the industrial sector and concentrates on
medium and small enterprises. Since 1972, BIP has also operated the Government's
special fund for financing non-traditional exports (FENT) which makes short-terms
loans at below market rates. About half of the bank's loans are short-term,
funded principally through FENT or from its own resources. BIP's medium-term
loans to industrial enterprises are provided at rates slightly below commercial
bank short-term rates and substantially below medium-term loan rates of the
financieras. The bank has relied heavily on funding from the Central Bank
and continued capital increases. Other important sources of term financing
for small and medium (and sometimes large) industrial enterprises have been
loans from international development organizations, repaid by the government
and capitalized in BIP.
3.11      Banco Minero del Peru (BMP) was established to provide medium- and
long-term financing to small and medium mining companies. Like BIP, it
complements the activities of COFIDE which has focused on the larger, mainly
state-owned mining companies. BMP is also active in participating in small
mining companies on a partnership basis, and serves to provide technical and
marketing assistance. Of its total assets, 37% were in the form of loans and
27% in investments at year-end 1979. Though Banco Minero may take demand
deposits from the public, time deposits from financial institutions and issue
bonds, it has relied principally on Central Bank credits as its main source of
funds.
The Non-Banking System
3.12      COFIDE, (Corporacion Financiera de Desarrollo).  Established in 1971
as a state-owned industrial development finance institution, COFIDE's principal
focus has been the financing of medium- and large-scale industrial projects,
in particular those of state-owned enterprises. Acting as an agent for the
Government, COFIDE negotiates foreign credits and provides credit guarantees
which, in recent years, have accounted for 40% of its total assets. COFIDE
also raises local resources through the issue of bonds which, because of
special tax benefits, are among the most attractive savings instrument in the
country. In 1976, COFIDE received a Bank loan (Loan 1356-PE) to carry out
the First Industrial Credit Project and will also be the implementing agency
under the proposed project. Although it started to lend through other
financial intermediaries in mid-1978, COFIDE is currently being restructured
to increase its wholesale credit function. A detailed review of COFIDE's past
operations, financial situation and.future role as the main wholesaler of term
resources to the industrial and other sectors is included in Chapter IV.



- 13 -
3.13      Financieras.  Private finance companies were established primarily
to provide medium-term financial services which, under the banking law, cannot
be offered by the commercial banks and were not being fully met by the special-
ized development banks. In 1971, a new law was passed bringing the financieras
under the control of the Central Bank and establishing minimum capital require-
mients. Of the 37 financieras existing in 1971, only six companies remained in
operation when the law was passed. Since 1978, when local commercial banks
and other financial groups took a renewed interest in setting up other finance
companies, six new financieras have been authorized, of which two had not yet
begun operations as of June 1980 (Annex 4, T-13). Of the 12 finance companies,
three are majority owned by government-owned institutions. A more detailed
discussion of the financieras and their operations is included in Chapter IV.
Domestic Resource Mobilization
3.14      The mobilization of domestic financial savings in Peru is done
mainly by the banking sector, which at the end of 1979 held 85% of all finan-
cial obligations with the private sector (Annex 4, T-10). Non-bank financial
instruments include savings and time deposits of the savings and loan associa-
tions, and time deposits and bonds issued by COFIDE and the financieras.
Insurance policies are also an important form of financial savings. In
addition, a limited number of non-financial institutions place financial
instruments, principally stocks and bonds.
3.15      At year-end 1979, demand deposits in local currency accounted for
24.1% of the total monetary liabilities of the banking system, but they had
been steadily decreasing in real terms since 1975 and also decreased as a
percentage of total liabilities, from 30.1% in 1977. Savings deposits are
issued by the banking system (except the foreign bank branches), savings
cooperatives and savings and loan associations. They account for 19.7% of
the monetary liabilities of the banking system and are the main source of
funds of cooperatives and savings and loans associations. Savings deposits
have also decreased in real terms since 1975, although at a smaller rate than
demand deposits.
3.16      All financial institutions operating in Peru (except insurance
companies) may take time deposits in local currency, whereas the regional
banks and financieras also issue negotiable certificates of deposit. In 1979,
time deposits accounted for only 6.2% of the monetary liabilities of the
banking system, down from 11.0% in 1977. In contrast, the financieras have
been very aggressive in mobilizing resources through their three-year cer-
tificates of deposit, particularly since late 1978 when the maximum interest
rate was raised to 38.5%, above that of all other instruments (Annex 4, T-22).
Certificates of deposit of the financieras were also given a favorable treat-
ment by the Central Bank in terms of the legal reserve requirements, which
are only 6%, compared to 38% on time deposits of commercial banks and 17% for
regional banks. Although there is no active secondary market for the certifi-
cates of deposits, they may be normally sold to the commercial bank associated
to the issuing financiera at little or no discount. As a result of all these
relative advantages, certificates of deposit have been the main source of
funds of the financieras and have grown substantially in real terms. As of
December 1979, certificates of deposit were S/.20.3 billion (US$81.1 million
equivalent), about 59X of the total liabilities of the financieras.



- 14 -
3.17      Bonds have not been used to any large extent by Peruvian financial
institutions, with the exception of COFIDE. Although the financieras, construc-
tion industry banks and Banco de la Vivienda are also authorized to issue bonds,
a maximum interest rate below that of the certificates of deposit, longer term
maturities and the lack of a well developed secondary market have made them
relatively unattractive instruments. COFIDE's type 'C' bonds have been more
successful, particularly after 1978, because of a special tax incentive which
permits the original buyer to reduce his income tax liability by 35% of the
purchase value of the bond. In the past, two financieras issued bonds but in
very small amounts. Banco de la Vivienda has also issued bonds, placing them
with insurance companies that were required to hold them.
3.18      All deposits taking institutions, except the savings bank, are
authorized to take deposits in foreign currency (demand deposits as well as
negotiable certificates of deposit) as part of the government's efforts to
repatriate the savings invested abroad. Certificates of deposit in foreign
currency have grown remarkably as a result of the high world interest rates
(to which the rates on the deposits are tied) and the negative real rates paid
on local currency deposits. From about 3.2% of the monetary liabilities of
the banking system in 1977, they increased to 23.7% in 1979.
Interest Rates
3.19      During the last ten years, interest rates in Peru have been regu-
lated by the Monetary Council and, since mid-1978, by the Central Bank and the
government which established a very complex structure of rates differentiated
by financial instrument, by type of intermediary, and by sector of destination.
As a result of the very high rates of inflation, all deposit and lending
interest rates in local currency have been negative in real terms since the
early 1970s. Substantial increases in the structure of interest rates took
place from mid-1978 to early 1979 (Annex 4, T-24) but the further acceleration
of inflation quickly eroded the improvements. As of September 30, 1980,
lending rates were for the most part unified at 32.5% for short-term loans and
37.5% for medium-term loans in local currency (plus commission fees of 1 to 3%
p.a. and a 17% tax on interest payments). In December 1980, a new law was
passed, eliminating the 17% tax and giving the Central Bank full responsibility
for establishing interest rates. At the same time, the Central Bank approved
a full revision and simplification of the interest rate structure, including
an average increase of 20 percentage points on most deposit and lending rates
effective on January 5, 1981 (Annex 4, T-22 and T-23). Under the new structure,
medium- and long-term loans in local currency carry an interest rate of 56.5%
p.a., plus annual commissions of 1.5% to 3%. As interest in paid quarterly,
the corresponding effective rates range from 71.9% to 74.1% p.a. If the
Government's fiscal and monetary policy measures are successful in bringing
down inflation from the current 60% (average for 1980) to 50% in 1981, the
new rates would be highly positive in real terms.
3.20      Foreign currency lending rates have not been regulated in recent
years, in spite of the fact that practicalliy all fotelgAn fesXres used f4or
term lending have been mobilized by the Government and lent by public sector
financial institutions. Given the lack of coordination among institutions
and the competition based on low interest rates using cost-free resources



- 15 -
provided by the government, some of the state development banks have been
[Lending to the final borrowers at rates below the cost of the foreign resources.
As an example, since early 1980, BIP has been making US dollar denominated
:Loans to industrial enterprises located outside the Lima-Callao area at 9%
p.a. using funds provided by the Government (as equity contributions) and
obtained from the IDB and co-financing commercial banks at a financial cost
(LIBOR plus 7/8 for the co-financing component) that exceeds the final lending
rate of BIP. However, at the same time, term lending for industry provided by
the Central Bank (through FIRE) for projects outside Lima-Callao and denomi-
nated also in US dollars, carried interest rates of 13-14% (para. 3.23).
Thus, it is necessary to establish an efficient and consistent interest rate
policy for term lending in foreign currency, to eliminate distortions in the
allocation of resources and to develop a healthy and competitive financial
system. The proposed project would help to accomplish this objective by
strengthening the new role of COFIDE as the major wholesaler of foreign
financial resources for term lending (para. 4.10) and by supporting its
role as one of the main public sector financial agents.
Term Lending to Industry and Other Sectors
3.21      The main institutions channelling term resources to the industrial
and other productive sectors have been COFIDE, the state development banks,
the financieras and, to a smaller extent, the regional banks. In addition,
the commercial banks have been ocassionally involved in term lending, channel-
ing resources provided by the Central Bank and COFIDE with special authoriza-
tion of the Central Bank. The relative importance of public sector financial
institutions has been substantial, with COFIDE and the state development banks
accounting for 72% of the total assets of the institutions engaged in term
lending (Table 3.1). In addition, the Government-owned financieras account
for an additional 4.6% of the assets of the group, and two of the five regional
banks are also owned by the Government.

3.22      Term lending institutions have complemented their own funds with the
rediscount funds established by the Central Bank during the last two years.
The first to be introduced was the Fondo de Redescuento Agroindustrial (FRAI)
escablished in 1978 to finance agroIndustrial projects, and partalazy financed
1:hrough a US$14.7 million loan from AID (plus US$4.9 million equivalent in



- 16 -
counterpart funds provided by the Central Bank). Subloans for a period of up
to 10 years with up to 2 years of grace, for a maximum of US$750,000 equivalent,
are denominated in local currency and carry an interest rate of 1.5 percentage
points above the Central Bank rediscount rate (currently 46.5%). As of
August 15, 1980, a total of 89 subloans had been approved, for a total amount
of S/.5.02 billion. The average subloan size at the prevailing exchange rate
for that date was a low US$191,000 equivalent, indicating that the FRAI has
operated basically as a small and medium scale industry credit line. A total
of 24 financial intermediaries channelled FRAI resources, with 8 financieras
accounting for nearly 58% of the total, followed by 7 commercial banks (about
27%) and 4 regional banks (9.5%). The FRAI resources are likely to be fully
committed by the end of 1980 when only repayments will be available for
additional lending.
3.23      In November 1979, the Central Bank established the Fondo de Bienes
de Capital (FONCAP) with total resources of S/.5 billion (about US$17 million
equivalent) to finance the sale of domestically produced capital goods and
equipment. Subloans for a period of up to 10 years for a maximum of US$2
million equivalent, are denominated in local currency and carry an interest
rate of 3 percentage points above the Central Bank rediscount rate. As of
the end of July 1980, 63 subloans had been approved for a total amount of
S/. 4.45 billion and an average subloan size of about US$240,000 equivalent.
Of the 13 intermediaries channelling FONCAP resources, 8 financieras accounted
for 70% of the total, two commercial banks used 22% and two regional banks
used 4%. A third Central Bank fund, the Fondo de Inversiones Regionales (FIRE),
was established in February 1980 to finance a wide range of activities outside
the Lima-Callao area. FIRE resources were also S/. 5 billion, of which S/.
2.62 billion had been committed by July 30, 1980. Subloans of up to US$2 mil-
lion equivalent can be denominated in Soles (for the local component of the
projects) or in US dollars (for the imported component). Local currency
subloans carry interest rates ranging from 3 to 5 percentage points above the
Central Bank rediscount rate, and US dollar subloans carry rates of 15%. As
of the end of July, 1980, 14 subloans had been approved with an average size
of about US$650,000 equivalent. Five financieras accounted for 73% of the
total amount, two regional banks channelled 20% and two commercial banks the
remaining 7%.
3.24      The Central Bank also established, in April 1980, the Fondo de
Exportaciones (FONEX) with total resources of US$250 million, to provide pre-
and post-shipment financing for exports of capital goods. As of July 30,
1980, only 4 subloans for a total of US$1.13 million had been approved. As
another well established fund for non-traditional export financing (FENT) has
been managed by BIP (and channelled through financial intermediaries) since
1972, the need for the establishment of FONEX as a separate fund is not at all
clear. Consolidation of all export financing mechanisms, including a review
of terms and conditions, and coordination with other export incentives would
be desirable. The government and the Central Bank are currently reviewing the
justification for FONEX in the context of the proposed simplification of term
tenivng mechatzis%  an) of the transfer of tLe_ Ce.atral Bank funds to COFIDE
(paras. 3.25 to 3.27).

Recent Developments
3.25      Since July 1980, the new Government has been reviewing the role
of public sector financial institutions (particularly those channelling
term resources) and the consistency and efficiency of the multiple credit
lines for term financing currently in operation. In this context, the
Government requested Bank assistance to establish a new set of mechanisms to
handle the flow of term financial resources to industry and other subsectors,
using to the maximum extent possible the institutional capabilities of the
country's financial system, both public and private.
3.26      During the preparation of the proposed project, the Government and
the Central Bank established a clear separation and allocation of the follow-
irng functions: (i) definition, control and enforcement of financial policies
arLd operating procedures for term lending; (ii) domestic and foreign resource
mobilization and allocation to different subsectors; (iii) wholesale credit
operations, ensuring equal access to the available funds by all qualified
financial intermediaries and eliminating advantages derived from privileged
access to funds; and (iv) retail credit operations, by a wide range of finan-
cial intermediaries (both public and private) competing with each other on the
basis of the quality of service given, and not depending on their access to
more or less subsidized financial resources.
3.27      As part of the reallocation of functions, the Central Bank will
concentrate on the establishment and execution of the financial policy,
and has transfered the operation of the special funds (FRAI, FONCAP, FIRE and
FONEX) to COFIDE. The transfer was approved by the Board of Directors of the
Central Bank on November 13, 1980. COFIDE's increased function as the major
wholesaler of term resources required some changes in its institutional
sltructure, which were approved by COFIDE's Board of Directors on September 23,
1980 (para. 4.10).
3.,28     Resource mobilization (both domestic and foreign) under the new
system will take place both at the retail level,.by each financial interme-
diary (mostly for domestic resources), and at the wholesale level (partic-
uLarly for foreign resources). All public sector foreign borrowings will
be coordinated by PROINVERSION, a coordinating committee established on
October 30, 1980, under the chairmanship of the Ministry of Finance and Economy,
and including the Central Bank, the Planning Office, and the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs. The Central Bank will also establish the general terms and
conditions for on-lending term resources obtained through public sector
foreign borrowings by COFIDE and for the state development banks. Finally,
a draft Foreign Debt Law allocates to COFIDE the role of financial agent for
medium- and long-term foreign borrowings of public enterprises, and to Banco
de la Nacion a similar role for the central Government. The financial agents
will provide assistance in the identification and selection of sources of
funds, as well as in the negotiations, and will charge a fee for such services,
but their participation will not imply the provision of a guarantee.
3.29      The new set-up would allow tapping all external sources of funds
available within an integrated demand and resource allocation framework, after
evaluating the requirements of the different subsectors, thus eliminating the
piece-meal, institution-by-institution approach used in the past by COFIDE,



- 18 -
BIP, Central Bank, Banco Minero, other state development banks, and various
other public sector entities and enterprises. The coordination of all public
sector external borrowings for development financing would also increase the
borrowing and negotiating capacity vis-a-vis foreign lenders, help to use the
full absorptive capacity of the financial system, eliminate the 'bilateral
monopoly' situations developed over the last few years (IDB-BIP, World Bank-
COFIDE, AID-Central Bank), and force both the domestic and foreign institutions
to analyze Peru's financing requirements within a global context, taking into
account all subsectoral needs and priorities, and achieving an efficient
allocation of resources.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS
A. General
4.01      Past Bank involvement with the industrial and tourism sectors in
Peru has been mainly through the first Industrial Credit Project with COFIDE
(Loan 1358-PE of December 27, 1976) and the recent Program Loan (Loan 1693-PE
of 1979) 1/. In addition to the proposed Second Industrial Credit Project,
a project to support the development of small scale enterprises (SSE) through
a wide range of financial intermediaries is currently under preparation.
The main objectives of the first Industrial Credit Project were to support
efficient manufacturing, processing and tourism projects with a favorable
impact on Peru's balance of payments, to increase COFIDE's effectiveness as
a development bank, and to help improve its economic analysis of projects.
After suffering some delays during the first 18 months of the project, mainly
due to the country's economic crisis of 1977-78 (para. 1.03), commitments
started to improve in late 1978. Currently, 91% of the total amount of
Loan 1358-PE (US$35 million), has been committed.
4.02      In spite of the economic recovery during 1979, particularly in
the export-oriented industrial subsectors, commitments under Loan 1358-PE
increased only moderately because of the requirement that final borrowers
take the full exchange risk between the currencies disbursed and the S/.
During a period of rapid devaluation of the SI. with respect to the US$
and with a recent history of poor performance by the US$ in the international
currency markets, most borrowers were reluctant to take such risk. The
increase in commitments in late 1978 and early 1979 was caused by several
factors, including the temporary operation of the special disbursement pro-
cedure for DFC operations (which guaranteed 50% of the disbursements in US$),
discontinued in 1980, and the severe shortage of foreign exchange in Peru
1/   A mining project with CENTROMIN (a public sector mining company) was
also supported by a Bank loan of US$40 million in 1976 (Loan 1281-PE).
In 1980, two technical assistance loans to SIDERPERU (the Government-owned
steel mill) and to the Government (for PROBAYOVAR, a Government-owned
firm which develops the Bayovar phosphate mining project) have also
been approved.



- 19 -
during the same period. Improvements in the availability of foreign exchange,
the elimination of the special disbursement procedure for DFCs and the avail-
ability of term resources in local currency and in US$ at negative real
interest rates in the Central Bank and BIP (paras. 3.20 to 3.23) slowed down
commitments again in 1980.
4.03      As of October 31, 1980, 67 subloans had been approved under Loan
1358-PE, for a total of US$31.2 million. Of these, 15 subprojects were above
the free limit of US$500,000, with an average subloan size of US$1.4 million,
and 52 subprojects were below the free limit with an average subloan size of
about US$200,000 (Annex 4, T-39). The 15 subprojects above the free limit
had total investment costs of US$77.8 million of which US$20.4 million were
financed with proceeds of the Bank loan. Excluding three subprojects for
wh:Lch detailed incremental employment generation is not available, the num-
ber of direct jobs created by the remaining 12 subprojects was 1,322, with
a relatively high average investment cost per job of US$51,000 (Annex 4,
T-40). Employment generation by the 52 smaller subprojects was considerably
higher, as the most recent 11 subprojects under the free limit (receiving
total subloans of US$2.5 million) indicate a total employment generation
of 1,826 jobs. The figures for subprojects above the free limit understate
the generation of employment because of some very large modernization sub-
projects which did not create additional employment but allowed the conti-
nuation of existing jobs. On the other hand, the figures for the smaller
subprojects appear to be overestimated in at least two cases as it is unlikely
that the respective firms (to be created) will reach the volume of employment
indicated in the reports. Assuming an average investment cost per job of
US$10,000 in the subprojects below the free limit (well above the reported
average for the 11 subprojects above), the overall average for the subprojects
financed under Loan 1358-PE would be about US$25,000. The subsectoral dis-
tribution of subloans approved under Loan 1358-PE is summarized in Annex 4,
T-39, and the main features of the 15 subprojects above the free limit,
including total project cost, employment generation as well as economic and
financial rates of return are summarized in Annex 4, T-40. During the last
two years' COFIDE started to lend through other financial intermediaries,
which channelled one half of the number of subloans (all of them under the
free limit, with one exception). The total amount of subloans channelled
through intermediaries was US$9.8 million, nearly one third of the total
amount committed.
4.04      The proposed Second Industrial Credit Project would be a follow
up to the ongoing project with COFIDE, and would support the realignment
of public sector financial institutions channelling term credit to the
productive sectors (paras. 3.25 to 3.29). It would concentrate on strength-
ening COFIDE's capabilities to supervise other participating financial
intermediaries and to review subprojects, helping it to carry out its new role
as the major wholesaler of term resources. In addition to COFIDE, the partici-
pating financial intermediaries through which COFIDE would on-lend resources
under the proposed project would be mainly the institutions participating
under Loan 1358-PE. However, in order to reflect more fully the specialization
of the different types of institutions, commercial banks, which are now limited
by law to lending operations of less than one year would not be eligible in
principle under the project.

B. COFIDE
Background
4.05      COFIDE was established in 1971 as an autonomous state enterprise
principally to stimulate and promote Peruvian entrepreneurial activity; to
coordinate and guarantee the financing of state enterprises; to mobilize
resources for priority projects of state, reformed private, private, and
social property enterprises; and to expand the domestic capital market.
Initially, COFIDE was also designated to own the Government's shares in
all state enterprises, but when this proved too difficult for the institution,
legislation was enacted reducing COFIDE's responsibility to that of holding
the shares in custody. However, between 1973 and 1979 several private
sector firms nationalized by the Government were allocated to COFIDE to be
held on its own account (para. 4.08). Thus, COFIDE's scope and tasks are
wider and more complex than those of many DFCs associated with the Bank.
4.06      At year-end 1979, COFIDE had total assets of SI. 160.8 billion
($643 million), including SI. 45.6 billion ($187 million) in net loans out-
standing, S/. 37.8 billion ($151 million) in investments, and S/. 65.6 billion
($262 million) in guarantees issued on its own account (Annex 4, T-25). Its
equity, including surplus from revaluation of its investments portfolio,
reserves, and retained earnings, stood at SI. 41.6 billion ($166 million).
Of the S/. 23.7 billion of paid-in capital, 93% was held by the Government,
and the remainder by individuals and companies that had received COFIDE's
shares as part of compensation under the agrarian reform. At the height of
the latter program (in 1973) as many as 21% of COFIDE's shares were held by
individuals and companies. Continued capital increases subscribed by the
Government and a decreasing use of COFIDE's shares to compensate individuals
and companies have resulted since 1973 in a steady increase in the Govern-
ment's share control of COFIDE. Regardless of ownership, however, by law
the control of COFIDE rests with the Government which exercises its authority
through the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and COFIDE's Board of
Directors.
4.07      Until recently COFIDE's operations and management attention were
heavily concentrated in activities related to its mandate to coordinate and
guarantee the financing of state enterprises, including the holding of shares
of certain of these companies. In addition, COFIDE has had since its estab-
lishment the added responsibility for coordinating all state enterprise
financing as well as guaranteeing their financing when and as required. In
support of the latter, COFIDE can lend to state enterprises from its own
resources; arrange and participate in the financing of state enterprises,
other than State banks, either on its own account or on behalf of the Govern-
ment; and issue guarantees on behalf of these enterprises, either on its
own account or acting as agent for the Government. Until very recently, these
activities, together with its ownership of basic industries described in the
following paragraph, have dominated COFIDE's operations. The effect of the
institution's emphasis on public sector financing is still reflected in its
portfolio (para.4.22 ). Although during the last three years lending to the
private sector has increased substantially, as of June 30, 1980, 50% of the
loans outstanding and 56% of the guarantees issued on COFIDE's own account were
to State enterprises. Together they represented 35% of COFIDE's total assets.



- 21 -
4.08      Between 1973 and 1979, the Government decreed that COFIDE hold for
its own account some of the private companies operating in "basic industries"
that were nationalized during the period. Currently it holds twelve such
companies in its portfolio . Five are cement companies, three are in paper,
two in chemicals, one is a combined paper and chemicals concern, and one is
in metalmechanics. 1/ Most of these equity holdings exceed COFIDE's single
client exposure limits, and have diverted from its originally intended purpose
and frozen a large proportion of COFIDE's resources. As of June 30, 1980, the
equity held by COFIDE in the thirteen companies accounted for 89% of its
investments portfolio, and represented 85% of COFIDE's own equity. Including
loans and guarantees, COFIDE had 36% of its total assets tied up in these
companies (Annex 4, T-30).
COFIDE's New Role
4.09      As part of the ongoing realignment of public sector financial insti-
tuitions channeling term resources (paras. 3.25 to 3.29), COFIDE went through a
fundamental reassessment of its role. The outcome has been a reorientation of
COFIDE's objectives and priorities, with a consequent major change in its
organizational (para. 4.10) and financial structures, and some additions to
its operating policies and procedures (para.4.16). Most important, COFIDE
will divest itself of its frozen investments in basic industries and concentrate
on development banking functions. To this effect, COFIDE would sell its invest-
ments in basic industries to the Government. The shares of the basic industries
wcould then be owned by the Government (directly or through a holding company)
and would be held by COFIDE on behalf of the Government (in custody) as is
currently the case with the shares of the large public enterprises (SIDERPERU,
PETROPERU, and others). The sale would be financed through a long-term loan
from COFIDE to the Government (or to the holding company). Servicing of the
loan would provide COFIDE with the increased liquidity it needs. Given COFIDE's
low debt/equity ratio (about 3:1 in December 1981) there is no immediate need
for additional capital contributions by the Government. Thus, with the proposed
transfer and the corresponding financial arrangements, COFIDE's total assets
and equity would remain unchanged after the transfer without additional burden
to the Government. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Govern-
ment and COFIDE on the transfer of ownership, to be carried out not later than
December 31, 1981. As the transfer would require changes in legislation, to
be approved by the Government under the special powers given by Parliament on
December 15, 1980, for a period of 180 days, approval of the appropriate
legislative decrees would be a condition for loan effectiveness.
4.10      Another major objective of COFIDE is to expand its lending operations
to the private sector, and to increase the coverage of that sector by channel-
ling increasing amounts of term capital, particularly foreign resources,
through financial intermediaries. Although COFIDE began lending through
intermediaries and expanded its volume of private sector operations in 1978,
this type of lending was limited. COFIDE did not actively promote lending
through intermediaries because it lacked the organizational capability.
1/   The metalmechanics company, MORAVECO, is not considered a basic
industry. The Government, however, decreed the takeover, against
COFIDE's wishes, because the company was facing very serious
financial difficulties.



- 22 -
COFIDE's Board of Directors took a decisive step to remedy this situation
with the organizational changes it approved on September 23, 1980, and which
included the creation of a new Financial Intermediaries Division along with
COFIDE's other two operating divisions. The new division has been partly
staffed with personnel experienced in dealing with intermediaries as a
result of the transfer to COFIDE on November 13, 1980, of the four funds
(FRAI, FONCAP, FIRE and FONEX) operated by the Central Bank (paras. 3.22 to
3.24). COFIDE will also help strengthen the financial intermediaries, both
institutionally and financially. This objective is reflected in the new
division's operating policies (para. 4.16). One of the objectives of the
proposed loan is to support COFIDE's activities in this new area of operation.
Finally, COFIDE will no longer be responsible for project evaluation and
financing of all investment projects of public enterprises, but will act as a
financial agent for such enterprises. The projects themselves and their fi-
nancing plan will be subject to approval by the Prime Minister and PROINVERSION
will act as a coordinating committee and make appropriate recommendations.
COFIDE's role will be limited to providing financial consulting services and
to act as an executing agent for PROINVERSION, without taking any credit
risks (para 3.28).
Organization and Management
4.11      COFIDE's organization includes a seven-member Board of Directors
and a Credit Committee. The Board, which is COFIDE's highest authority,
is appointed by the MEF (Annex 4, T-38). The Board takes an active interest
in directing COFIDE's policies and operations, and has fully endorsed the new
role of the institution (paras. 4.08 and 4.09). The members of the Board and
the senior management have the experience, skills and capacity to carry out
this role successfully.
4.12.     Under the General Manager, who is mainly responsible for day-to-day
operations, operational responsibilities have functionally been assigned to
the new Resources, Operations, and Financial Intermediaries divisions (Annex 4,
C-2). This structure contrasts sharply with the previous organization in
which operating responsibilities were vested in four operating divisions,
Finance, International, Credits, and Investments, with many overlapping
functions and responsibilities and little coordination among them. The
Investments Division, in charge of managing COFIDE's investment portfolio and
recommending new promotional investments, acted independently of, and with
little coordination with the Credits Division. Each division had subsector
specialized project analysts that often duplicated work in the same subsector,
and which have now been merged under the new Operations Division. Each
division had its own legal department; this function has now been consolidated
under the General Manager.
4.13      COFIDE's second-level management and professional staff are competent
and experienced. The Resources, Financial Intermediaries, and Operations
division managers recently joined COFIDE and brought with them considerable
commercial and development banking experience. About two thirds of COFIDE's
220 professionals, out of a total staff of 441, have been with the institution
five or more years. The number of staff members appears somewhat high consider-
ing the current level of clients and operations (para. 4.22), but should facili-
tate handling of an increase in activities, particularly that expected from the
new Financial Intermediaries Division.



- 23 -
4.14      Although COFIDF's accounting systems appear adequate, both the new
management and the appraisal mission were concerned with the quality of
information produced for decision makiiig and control purposes. Furthermore,
COFIDE's old organization did not contain the function of controller.  One
result was that very often conflicting information reached management on the
same subject. Consequently, during negotiations agreement was reached on the
development and implementation by COFIDE of a uniform management information,
control, and performance evaluation system, to be operated by the new Financial
Administration department, by December 31, 1981.
Policies and Procedures
4.15      During the preparation of the first industrial credit project
(Loan 1358-PE) COFIDE prepared a comprehensive Policy Statement (Annex 1),
focusing on its development banking functions. Some minor modifications and
additions to it have since been made (for example, to tighten the conditions
of disbursement or additional funding to clients with a poor repayment history,
and to allow application of stiffer penalties for arrears), but their substance
remains unchanged and applicable to COFIDE's new role and priorities. Except
for the need to expand on policies applicable to lending to or through finan-
cial intermediaries (para. 4.16), the existing policies and procedures are
adequate. At the time of appraisal of Loan 1358-PE the Bank had been unable
to endorse COFIDE's policies in the absence of a clear definition of the
institution's involvement in holding state enterprises. Instead, a separate
Statement of Operating Policies and Procedures was developed and made part
of the contractual arrangements that governed lending under Loan 1358-PE.
Since the issue of COFIDE's involvement in holding state enterprises was
already solved (para. 4.05), and its involvement in basic industries will
be solved with COFIDE divesting itself of these activities (para. 4.09),
the need for two separate policy documents has disappeared and the Bank can
endorse COFIDE's Policy Statement.
4.16      The expansion of COFIDE's lending operations through financial
intermediaries made necessary the preparation of a comprehensive set of
policies to govern these activities (Annex 2). Agreement was reached during
negotiations that these policies be approved by COFIDE's Board, with any
modifications they may introduce being satisfactory to the Bank, and included
in its overall Policy Statement as a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
loan.
4.17      COFIDE appraises all projects submitted to it for financing, with
emphasis on financial, technical, marketing, and, increasingly, economic
aspects. Overall, appraisals and the appraisal reports are of good quality.
Before Loan 1358-PE, COFIDE had introduced economic appraisal on a trial
basis, and Loan 1358-PE required this appraisal on all Bank financed sub-
projects. Since then, COFIDE has been increasingly including the calculation
of economic rate of return among the criteria it uses in selecting projects
for financing with resources other than those of Loan 1358-PE. COFIDE has
also improved its supervision activities and capabilities, and pays greater
attention to the project implementation capacity of investment enterprises
than it was doing at the time of the first Bank loan. In part this has been
aided by the growing experience of its loan officers, and by their being



- 24 -
organized along sectoral and subsectoral lines which allows them greater
specialization and know-how of their clients' activities. On balance, COFIDE's
appraisal and supervision capacity is sufficiently strong to entrust it with
allocating the proceeds of the proposed loan.
4.18      In recent years COFIDE has been giving increasing attention to
procurement decisions, particularly those of its larger clients. Also,
COFIDE assists their clients by preparing financial packages which blend
export financing from supplier countries (generally at lower interest rates
than Bank resources but with restricted procurement sources) with resources
from Loan 1358-PE. Thus, the proposed loan will continue to support COFIDE's
efforts (and those of the participating intermediaries) to expand and diversify
the procurement sources and to provide matching financial packages. COFIDE
requires several alternative quotations for all procurement in its lending to
the private sector, and national or international bidding is the standard
procedure for public sector enterprises under Peruvian law. For all Bank
projects COFIDE would satisfy itself that the goods and services to be
purchased are suitable for the investment project and are reasonably priced,
and it would provide the rationale for procurement in all subloan appraisals
(para. 5.08). Disbursement procedures are adequate to ensure that funds are
used for their intended purpose. Loan collection procedures and follow-up on
arrears are also satisfactory.
4.19      Under Peru's public sector law, COFIDE is subject to the control of
the Government's General Accounting Office, which in turn annually appoints
independent accounting firms to audit COFIDE's accounts. These firms have
performed reasonably well, but the frequent change of auditors has resulted in
a lack of continuity and frequent changes in the auditing format, although
primarily for minor items. Past audit reports (1977, 1978 and 1979) have had
minor qualifications regarding the underestimation by COFIDE of its investment
portfolio, and its income from such investments, arising from the capitaliza-
tion of revaluations. The increased investments and equity corresponding
to 1977 and 1978 were registered in 1978 and 1979, respectively. The Government
is now considering the possibility of allowing public sector firms (including
COFIDE) to carry out the selection of external auditors, which would result in
greater continuity and shorter delays. During negotiations, agreement was
reached with COFIDE on the appointment of independent auditors, acceptable to
the Bank, to prepare annually full audit reports following the long form format
for DFCs associated with the Bank.
Past Operations
4.20      COFIDE's total operations (approvals measured in current soles 1/)
increased from S/. 29.8 billion in 1976 to SI. 134.8 billion in 1979, a 65%
yearly growth in a period during which inflation averaged about 54% annually.
However, this increase was due mostly to COFIDE's operations on behalf of the
Government and on which COFIDE assumes no risk. In this area COFIDE's role
has been restricted to providing expertise in arranging and negotiating, when
1/   COFIDE's yearly foreign exchange approvals were converted into soles
at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of each year. Although
resulting figures are adequate for a year to year comparison of commit-
ments, with the continuing devaluation of the sol these approvals cannot
be compared directly with disbursements in the financial statements.

and as required, foreign loans in line with its original mandate to assure the
financing of state enterprises (para. 4.07). COFIDE's operations on its own
account, including guarantees and investments, fell from SI. 19.3 million in
1976 to SI. 8.3 billion in 1977 due to the severe recession and balance of
payments difficulties, wnich affected investment activities of both private
and public sector enterprises, as well as COFIDE's ability to raise capital
abroad. Since mid-1978, COFIDE's operations on its own account grew substan-
tially reaching S/. 39.8 billion in 1979, and S/. 28.5 billion during the
first six months of 1980. The level of loans during the first half of 1980
(S/. 21.5 billion) nearly reached the level for the whole of 1979. The number
of operations fell from 120 in 1976 to 90 in 1977, and then increased gradually
to 156 in 1979, and 116 during the first half of 1980 (Annex 4, T-27).
4.21      A sectoral breakdown of operations shows that the share of total
approvals to the manufacturing sector increased from 19% in 1976 to 67% in
1979 (Annex 4, T-28), while mining declined from 58% to 3%. 1/ The most
important manufacturing subsectors in 1979 were iron and steel (18% of the
total amount), metalmechanics (14%), paper (9%), and agroindustries (8%).
Other important subsectors were fisheries (11%) and transport (8%). The
sectoral composition of COFIDE's lending has varied considerably from year to
year with a few large projects making a substantial difference in any one
year. However, the importance of manufacturing, followed by mining (14%
during the first half of 1980) and energy (19%) is clear. Geographically,
COFIDE's operations have been reasonably well distributed. Of the S/. 119.3
billion approved since 1976, the north has received 28%, the south 23%, the
Lima/Callao area 17%, the central region 11%, and the east 10%, while non-
regional projects accounted for 11%. By maturity, 75% of COFIDE's loans and
guarantees during the same four and a half year period were for more than 5
years and 18% were for between 2 and 5 years (Annex 4, T-28).
Portfolio Quality
4.22      COFIDE's overall exposure reached S1. 156.0 billion (US$624 million)
at year-end 1979, and S/. 181.4 billion (US$636 million) by June 30, 1980.
As of the latter date, the exposure included S/. 53.6 billion in loans out-
standing, S/. 48.5 billion of equity investments, and S/. 79.3 billion of
guarantees on own account. In addition, as of June 30, COFIDE had S/. 18.9
billion in undisbursed loan commitments. Included in the loan portfolio were
389 loans to 156 companies (Annex 4, T-29). Overall, COFIDE had 171 clients,
of which 135 had received only loans, 21 had received loans and equity invest-
ments, and 15 only equity investments (Annex 4, T-30). Of COFIDE's overall
exposure, S/.71.5 billion (39.4%) were to state enterprises, S/. 72.0 billion
(39.7%) to basic industry companies held by COFIDE (para.4.08), and S/. 37.1
billion (20.5%) to the private sector.
4.23      On the whole the quality and management of COFIDE's portfolio
is adequate. As of June 30, 1980, arrears over 90 day were only 6.2% of the
loan portfolio (Annex 4, T-31), and the exposure to companies in arrears was
only 5% of COFIDE's overall exposure (Annex 4, T-32). Write-offs have been
1/   The reduction in mining operations was due to COFIDE's past concentration
on large size public sector mining projects where no new starts took
place recently. However, COFIDE is expected to give increased emphasis
to small and medium size mining projects in the priva.e sector, both
directly and through financial intermediaries.

minimal and provisions adequate. 1/ Reschedulings during 1979 were SI. 4.3
billion, or 8.3% of the loan portfolio at the end of that year, but fully 92%
were in one company that was reorganized and recapitalized and for which
COFIDE had made provisions against its income equivalent to the reschedulings.
The quality of the portfolio is partly a result of close supervision by
COFIDE, which gives particular attention to companies with potential problems
identified during biannual in-depth analyses of the portfolios. The bi-annual
analyses rank companies into three groups according to their overall health,
including financial, managerial, technical, and subsectoral growth and profit
generation potential. In the first group are those companies developing satis-
factorily, in the second those with some degree of potential for future
problems, and in the third those that require COFIDE's immediate, close and
continued supervision. Excluding exposure in companies in COFIDE's investment
portfolio (ranked in Annex 4, T-30), as of June 30, 1980, COFIDE had 18
companies with a total exposure of SI. 16.2 billion in its so-called "critical"
list, that is, those in the third ranking requiring close supervision. Signif-
icantly, 86% of that exposure was to public sector companies, and only 14%, or
S/. 2.3 billion to 9 private sector companies of which only two were in
arrears.
4.24      There is, however,  a substantial concentration of potential risk in
COFIDE's portfolios. As of June 30, 1980, total exposure (loans, equity
investments and guarantees) in Sociedad Paramonga, a basic industry company in
the investment portfolio, was 73.4% of COFIDE's equity, in MINEROPERU, a state
mining enterprise, 34.9%, and in PETROPERU, the state petroleum company, 29.5%.
Furthermore, Sociedad Paramonga has been barely breaking even since the Govern-
ment decreed in 1978 that it take over a substantial investment in a newsprint
plant that just began operating and whose future profitability is still in
question. The concentration of potential risk will decrease with the upcoming
divestiture by COFIDE of the basic industry companies in its portfolio
(para. 4.09) and the new emphasis on lending to the private sector (para. 4.10).
4.25      Although COFIDE's provisions for losses in its portfolios are
adequate, and it has systematic procedures for determining provisions for
potential loan losses, provisions for decreases in the value of the equity
investments portfolio are made in an informal and ad hoc manner. During
negotiations agreement was reached on the development and implementation of
a systematic provisions policy for possible losses in value of the equity
investments portfolio, by December 31, 1981.
1/   As of June 30, 1980, total provisions (including provisions on interest
receivable) were St.  7.0 bUIIiomx, or 3,.97 of overall expo,Are.
Provisions for loans and investments alone were 6.7% of those two
portfolios combined.



- 27 -
Resources
4.26      As of December 31, 1979, COFIDE had mobilized SI. 141.2 billion
of which 19.3% were paid-in capital and retained earnings, 13.4% domestic
borrowings, and 67.3% foreign borrowings including those on which it provided
guarantees on its own account. COFIDE has traditionally played a large role
in mobilizing foreign resources, particularly for state enterprises as indi-
cated in para. 4.07. During the mid-1970's, it sought to actively mobilize
local savings but was thwarted by high inflation and low interest rates
(Annex 4, T-33). Since 1979 COFIDE has been able to begin raising substantial
domestic savings, particularly through its Type C bonds (para. 3.17). With
the Government's current change in interest rate policies (para. 3.19), it is
likely that COFIDE will be able to mobilize yet larger amounts of domestic
savings in coming years. COFIDF's foreign exchange resources available for
new commitments stood at US$109.3 million as of August 31, 1980. However,
39.5% of this amount was earmarked for specific projects (mostly for ELECTROPERU),
and 53.2% was in credits that were mostly tied to specific country procurement.
Untied credits available for general project financing amounted to only US$8.0
million. This compares with US$77.0 million in loan applications (53) received
during the first half of 1980, of which US$34.7 million were for foreign
currency loans, US$14.7 for foreign currency guarantees, and US$27.6 for local
currency financing.
Financial Position and Results
4.27      COFIDE's total assets, excluding guarantees, increased from
8/. 16.16 billion in 1975 to S/. 95.18 billion in 1979, an average yearly
growth of 56% compared with a 48% average yearly inflation during the same
period. This average growth, however, was marked by a rapid growth (74%
yearly) during 1976-1977 followed by a substantial slowdown (40% yearly) in
the following two years due to the severe recession which led to reduced
commitments in the earlier period (para. 4.20). Comparative balance sheets
for the period show an adequate financial position, although during 1977 and
1978 the long-term debt, including guarantees, to equity ratio was just over
the 5 to 1 allowed for in COFIDE's operating policy (Annex 4, T-25). This
situation was corrected in 1979 with a S/. 7.7 billion increase in paid-in
capital, and a further S/. 11.6 billion increase in equity resulting from the
revaluation of COFIDE's equity investments, mostly those of basic industry
companies. Liquidity has been satisfactory during 1975-1979, with the current
ratio varying between 1.5 to 1 (1975) and 2.3 to 1 (1979). Through June 30,
1980, COFIDE had no uncovered foreign exchange exposure.
4.28      Income statements for 1975-1979 show an 80% yearly growth in reve-
nues, excluding exchange gains, compared with an increase in administrative
expenses of only 49% yearly. The latter decreased steadily from 1.1% of
average total assets in 1975 to a very adequate level of only 0.6% in 1979.
However, although net return on equity has increased steadily from 2.9%
in 1975 to 7.4% in 1979, throughout the period it has remained well below the
prevailing rates of inflation, resulting in an erosion of capital in real
terms only partly offset by the revaluation of the equity investments porffolio.
Income has been affected by high provisions for bad debts, necessary to offset
the relatively low provisions made prior to 1976, and the low interest spreads



- 28 -
and charges, particularly on foreign currency loans to state enterprises, and
charges on guarantees on own account. COFIDE's Board, backed by the new
Government's policy which calls for interest rates that more closely reflect
the real cost of capital (para. 3.19), approved, in December 1980, a new
structure of increased interest rates for local currency loans and of interest
rate spreads, loans and guarantee fees on foreign currency effective from
January 1, 1981 (Annex 4, T-34). Under the new system, COFIDE's interest rate
for local currency loans is 56.5% p.a. plus an annual commision of 1.5%. COFIDE
loans also carry a 1.5% flat service fee and commitment fee of 1% p.a. The
corresponding effective annual rate (see para. 3.19) exceeds 70%.
Projected Operations
4.29      Given Peru's current economic recovery, the recent increase in
COFIDE's operations and its new role as a wholesaler of term resources,
COFIDE's volume of operations (direct loans and loans through financial
intermediaries) is expected to increase significantly during the next few
years. The current financial projections prepared by COFIDE are based on a
conservative growth rate of 5% annually in real terms. Based on expected
inflation rates and the expected devaluation of the sol, the projected loan
approvals (in current soles) are summarized in Table 4.1.

4.30      The above pattern of expected approvals, combined with the new
structure of interest rates (para. 4.28) would result in a satisfactory
financial situation for COFIDE during the next five years (Annex 4, T-35 to
T-37), including a gradual increase in its return on equity, and a debt/equity
ratio below the currently agreed limit of 5:1. As currently envisaged, the
proposed Bank loan (US$60 million equivalent) would account for nearly 25% of
COFIDE's foreign exchange requirements during the three-year commitment
period. As indicated above (para. 4.26), foreign exchange resources available
for commitment as of August 31, 1980, were US$109.3 million and several other
foreign borrowings are currently being negotiated, including a US$30 million
loan from IDB, originally scheduled to be used by the Central Bank through
FIRE and FONCAP.

C. Other Participating Financial Intermediaries
Introduction
4.31      The financial intermediaries that would participate under the
proposed loan would be those legally authorized to undertake term lending.
Currently, they include financieras, regional banks, and the specialized state
development banks of which only two, Banco Industrial and Banco Minero are ex-
pected to participate. Although commercial banks would not directly participate,
six of the seven locally owned commercial banks have a subsidiary financiera.
T'he limited term lending done in the past by commercial banks was mostly with
resources of the Central Bank funds (paras. 3.22-3.24) under an exception to
the applicable lending regulations. Commercial banks, however, accounted for
only 21% of the resources committed through July, 1980, and were mostly in
relatively small loans to the smaller sized beneficiaries of the Central Bank
funds. Thus, commercial banks could be important for participation under
the separate SSE project currently under preparation (para. 4.01).
Financieras
4.32      After several years of stagnation (their total assets fell in real
terms every year from 1975 to 1978) the financieras experienced a very rapid
growth, including the establishment of five new financieras, during 1979 and
the first half of 1980 (Annex 4, T-13). The main reason for the outstanding
performance of the financieras in 1979 was the change in the Central Bank
policy that allowed interest rates paid on time deposits in the financieras to
be set at levels above those paid by any other financial institution (para.
3.16). These higher yields attracted a large flow of savings to the
financieras generating an increase in total assets of about 54% in real terms
during 1979. This trend has continued during the first half of 1980, during
which assets have grown at an annual rate of about 70% in real terms. The bank-
ing law permits financieras to extend financing through medium-term credits,
which must exceed one year in maturity, and through contingent financing such
as guarantees, letters of credit and discounted bills. Loans are typically
extended at three-year maturities, commensurate to the average maturity of
their time deposits. In October 1979, a new decree was passed authorizing the
financieras to offer leasing services and expanding their abilities to provide
underwriting services. The financieras also play an important role as interme-
diaries in channelling resources from the four Central Bank development funds
and COFIDE. Historically, about 90% of their lending was to the industrial,
commercial and construction sectors (Annex 4, T-19), with industry taking the
largest share. In recent years, the share of financiera loans going to
industry has increased, reaching 75% of the total in 1979.
4.33       The principal source of funds for the financieras are negotiable
time deposits. As of June 30, 1980, time deposits in all financieras
represented 53% of their combined assets (72% of their assets excluding
guarantees). Financieras are allowed debt-to-equity ratios of 13 to 1 on
time deposits and long-term bonds, plus 4 to 1 on credits received from
other financial institutions. As of June 30, 1980, the time deposits (long-
term bond sales have been insignificant) captured by financieras were
9.3 times their combined paid-in capital and reserves, while credits from



- 30 -
other financial institutions were equal to their equity (Annex 4, T-17)
reflecting in part the shortage of long-term capital other than that made
available by the Central Bank funds. The proposed Bank loan would help fill
the gap in long-term foreign currency funds available to the financieras for
the financing of private sector projects requiring foreign exchange.
Regional Banks
4.34      The six regional banks, which operate as commercial banks with a
mandate to focus on the development of their respective regions, have in
recent years experienced a much higher rate of growth than commercial banks.
Their growth in 1979 was 25% in real terms compared to a 12% decline for
commercial banks (Annex 4, T-14). In addition to providing the normal services
offered by the other commercial banks, the regional banks may extend medium-term
financing and may issue certificates of deposit in local currency. They also
have access to special discounting facilities, operate with lower reserve re-
quirements (and receive higher yields on these reserves) and are allowed to offer
higher interest rates, in competing for time deposits. As a result, 30% of their
total liabilities consist of time deposits, as compared to 17% for the commer-
cial banks. While they are also allowed to operate in Lima, no more than 50%
of the resources mobilized in Lima may be placed in Lima; all resources
raised in the regions must be invested within the region.  In recent years,
the regional banks have been expanding their operations in Lima, and have
concentrated in short-term lending. However, their potential contribution to
decentralization of economic activity is considerable, and the Government is
interested in supporting a more pronounced orientation towards financing of
regional development.
4.35      Wlhile financieras and regional banks have already developed some
capabilities for project appraisal and have been exposed to economic analysis
of projects through their use of COFIDE resources, and particularly of re-
sources from FRAI, FIRE and FONCAP, their capabilities vary substantially and
they need improvement in nearly all institutions, with the possible exception
of the three largest financieras. COFIDE will actively help the participating
financial intermediaries to improve their capabilities through the subproject
review process and also by seminars and other technical assistance. As part
of this process and also to publicize its increased role in operating through
financial intermediaries, COFIDE recently organized a Project Appraisal Seminar
for the technical staff of the financial intermediaries and for COFIDE's own
staff. The seminar, carried out with Bank assistance took place from January 26
to January 30, 1981. COFIDE, through its Financial Intermediaries Division will
also monitor on a regular basis the financial performance of the intermediaries
to satisfy itself of their creditworthiness (para. 4.16), and could stop further
commitments to a given intermediary if sound financial criteria are not being
followed.

V. THE PROJECT AND PROPOSED BANK LOAN
Project Objectives
5.01      The proposed project would be a follow-up to the ongoing Industrial
Credit Project (Loan 1358-PE) with COFIDE. Its main objective would be
to support the reorganization of public sector financial institutions chan-
nelling term resources, and the establishment of a more open and competitive
system where a wide number of financial intermediaries would have equal access
to the resources available. COFIDE would be the main institution mobilizing
foreign resources to be channelled through other financial intermediaries to
small and medium size projects, or directly by COFIDE to finance larger
projects.  The proposed loan would also contribute to make COFIDE's new
organizational structure operational (para. 4.12), and would help to improve
its capabilities for economic analysis of projects, to pass on such capabil-
ities to the participating intermediaries, and to supervise and follow-up the
performance of the intermediaries (para. 4.35). In addition, COFIDE would
continue to mobilize domestic resources and to promote and generate new
projects, providing equity and long-term financing, and packaging joint
ventures with domestic and foreign investors.
The Proposed Bank Loan
5.02      Based on the prospects and trends in the general economic environ-
ment and the demand for industrial investment (para. 2.04), the processing
capacity and projected operations of COFIDE and the eligible financial inter-
mediaries (para. 4.29), as well as the expected availability of funds from
other foreign and local sources (para. 4.30) a Bank loan of US$60 million
is proposed to support the project. The proposed loan would be made to COFIDE
with a maturity of up to 17 years including up to 4 years of grace, but the
usual composite amortization schedule for Bank DFC loans would apply. The
Government would guarantee the loan and would assume the cross-currency
exchange risk (between the currencies being disbursed and the US dollar) in
exchange for a fee of 1.5% p.a. on the amount outstanding. The fee would be
reviewed periodically and would be credited to a special reserve fund to be
maintained by COFIDE. The accrued exchange differentials would be calculated
annually and the government would cover any shortfalls that may appear in
the reserve fund. Signing of an agreement between COFIDE and the Government
on the proposed mechanism to cover the cross-currency risk would be a condition
for loan effectiveness.
Margins to Intermediaries
5.03      Assumming a Bank interest rate at the time of Board presentation
of 9.6% p.a., and a cross-currency risk fee of 1.5% p.a., the interest rate
to COFIDE would be 11.1% p.a. COFIDE's onlending rate to the participating
financial intermediaries would be 12.1% p.a. providing a margin of 1.0% p.a.
to cover the administrative costs of financial intermediation and the commit-
ment fee on the total uncommitted amount, part of which would correspond
to funds to be used by the participating intermediaries.



- 32 -
The financieras and other intermediaries would have a margin of up to
3.0% p.a. on their subloans and COFIDE, when lending directly, would have
a total spread of up to 4.0% p.a. but not less than 3.0% p.a. (para. 5.04).
The additional spread on direct subloans by COFIDE would help to cover the
additional costs of foreign resource mobilization and commitment fees corres-
ponding to its wholesale function.
Onlending Terms and Interest Rates
5.04      Subloans would have a minimum maturity of 4 years and a maximum of
15 years, including up to three years of grace. Actual terms are expected to
range mainly between 7 and 12 years, with an average term of about 9 years,
although some tourism projects may require terms of 12-15 years and some
mining projects may have somewhat shorter terms (4 to 6 years) depending on
the size of the proven reserves. The subloans would be denominated in US
dollars and would bear an interest rate of up to 15.1% to the final borrowers
except in the case of large, creditworthy firms borrowing directly from
COFIDE, which might receive a lower rate but in no case less than 1411% p.a.
Similarly, the participating financial intermediaries, mainly the financieras,
may be willing to accept a smaller spread for some prime customers. Competition
among financieras to obtain the best customers has already provided some
examples of reduced spreads in 1980. The spreads and interest rates to the
final borrowers are in line with COFIDE's current practices, including the
terms of the Central Bank funds recently transferred to COFIDE (para. 3.27).
The US dollar onlending interest rate would be reviewed periodically by
COFIDE, at its own initiative or at the initiative of the Bank, and may be
adjusted, subject to the Bank's agreement, to take account of fluctuations in
the international capital markets and domestic credit demand. The terminal
date for submission of subproject proposals under the loan would be June 30,
1984, and the closing date for disbursements June 30, 1985. Annex 3 shows the
estimated schedule of disbursements.
Participation of Intermediaries
5.05      All financial intermediaries legally established in Peru, autho-
rized to undertake term lending operations in the industrial, mining and
tourism sectors, and in good standing with the Superintendency of Banks and
Financial Institutions would be eligible in principle for participation under
the proposed loan. Currently, the types of institutions meeting the above
criteria are the state development banks, financieras and regional banks.
Before signing the contract of participation, the Financial Intermediaries
Division in COFIDE would ensure that the specific intermediaries meet the
above criteria, as well as the conditions set forth in COFIDE's Policy for
Financial Intermediation (Annex 2), particularly regarding sound financial
practices and project appraisal capabilities. COFIDE's Financial Intermedia-
ries Division would monitor periodically the compliance with the above criteria
and conditions (para. 4.35). New types of financial institutions or existing
institutions subject to a revised legal framework may be considered for
participation inT the project at a later stage.  The participation of addi-
tional types of intermediaries would be subject to Bank approval, following
COFIDE's recommendation.



- 33 -
Eligible Enterprises and Lending Limits
5'.06     Enterprises eligible for subloans would include public, mixed
and private enterprises undertaking investment projects in the industrial
(including construction), mining and tourism sectors. Subprojects would have
to be financially and economically viable, and the direct lender (COFIDE or
t:he participating financial intermediary) would prepare a complete evaluation
of the proposed subproject, including the calculation of the economic rate of
return (ERR) for subprojects involving Bank financing above US$250,000. To
ensure the distribution of industrial credit over a satisfactory number of
recipients, a cumulative limit of US$5.0 million on the total financing to a
single enterprise or group of related enterprises would be applicable. An
enterprise would be considered to be related to a group when it owns or
effectively controls the voting stock of another firm, or itself is owned or
effectively controlled by another firm.
Free Limit
5.07      All subloans made directly by COFIDE using the proceeds of the Bank
loan and exceeding the amount of US$1 million would be subject to prior review
and approval by the Bank. In the case of subloans made by other financial
intermediaries, the free limit would be US$500,000. Initially, all subloans
submitted by the intermediaries will be subject to prior review and approval
by COFIDE irrespective of size, but COFIDE's Financial Intermediaries Division
would periodically review the performance and capabilities of the participating
intermediaries and may grant individual free limits to specific intermediaries,
in consultation with the Bank. UJnder the first project, subprojects above the
free limit accounted for 20% of the total number and 60% of the total loan
amount (para. 4.03). While the free limit for participating intermediaries
other than COFIDE would be the same as under the previous project, their
increased participation in the financing of projects with smaller average size
than those financed by COFIDE is expected to result in a similar share of sub-
projects being reviewed by the Bank.
Procurement and Disbursement
5.08      Procurement for subprojects would conform with standard practice
for DFC loans and procedures would be similar to those under the first
Industrial Credit Project. The financial intermediary (or COFIDE in the
case of direct loans) would require final borrowers to obtain quotations
from a reasonable sample of qualified suppliers for major pieces of equipment.
COFIDE would also monitor closely the procurement of items to be financed
under the Bank loan by other participating intermediaries, in order to ensure
that the items are reasonably priced and appropriate for their intended
purpose. Disbursement procedures would be similar to those under the first
project. The loan proceeds would be disbursed for: (a) 100% of foreign
expenditures for directly imported equipment, including installation and
start-up costs; (b) 70% of the expenditures on imported equipment purchased
Erom domestic distributors; and (c) 50% of the ex-factory cost of locally
'produced equipment and 35% of construction and civil works expenditures.



- 34 -
The above percentages represent the estimated average foreign exchange
component of eligible projects and are in line with comparable figures else-
where. As is customary under the Bank's DFC-type loans, only expenditures
made no more than 90 days prior to the date of receipt by the Bank of the
corresponding financing requests would be eligible for reimbursement under
the proposed loan (180 days for projects through financial intermediaries).
Project Benefits and Risks
5.09      The proposed project would make a major contribution in providing
term financing for investment projects in the industrial, tourism and small
and medium mining sectors. The project would provide financing for about
100 subprojects involving total investment costs of about US$120 million.
It is expected that about 50% of the proceeds of the loan would be used by
COFIDE for direct subloans ranging from US$500,000 to US$4 million, whereas
the remaining 50% would be on-lent through the participating financial
intermediaries for subloans ranging from US$150,000 to US$1 million. Direct
employment generation is expected to be about 4,000 jobs, based upon an
average investment cost per job of US$30,000, 1/ and substantial indirect
employment generation would also be expected. Most subprojects to be financed
under the proposed project are expected to have an ERR in the range of 15-40%.
5.10      The proposed project would also have a significant impact by support-
ing COFIDE's reorganization, its increased orientation towards the private
sector and its expanded role as a wholesaler of term resources through a
wide range of financial intermediaries. The project would contribute to
strengthen the main financial institutions providing term resources to industry
and other sectors, would encourage competition based on the quality of the
service provided, eliminating monopolistic situations arising from privileged
access to special sources of funds, and would help to improve the project
evaluation and supervision capabilities of the participating intermediaries.
Thus, the project would have a significant institution building impact on the
Peruvian financial sector.
5.11      While the project does not involve unusual risks regarding the
attainment of its major objectives, the ongoing policy changes in the indus-
trial and financial sectors may result in a lower than anticipated level of
economic activity, and the institutional changes within COFIDE may limit its
processing capacity and the level of loan approvals in 1981. The quality of
COFIDE's new management and the speedy implementation of the reorganization
are expected to keep the institutional risks to a minimum, whereas the pros-
pects for continuing economic recovery in Peru appear to be good.
1/   The average investment cost per job in the industrial sector during
the period 1972-76 was US$22,000 ranging from US$2,500 in garments to
US$55,000 in industrial chemicals. The estimated average for subprojects
financed under Loan 1358-PE is US$25,000 (para. 4.03).

VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During loan negotiations, agreements were reached on the following:

financial intermediation, satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.16).
6.03      Signing of a participation contract, satisfactory to the Bank,
between COFIDE and the eligible financial intermediaries would be a condi-
tion for participation of each financial intermediary.
6.04      The proposed project would constitute a suitable basis for a Bank
loan of US$60 million with a term of up to 17 years, including up to 4 years
of grace on conditions outlined in Chapter V.

of formulating, coordinating and evaluating its two-year operations program-
ming. This shall be done in accordance with the two-year plan for the national
public sector, legal provisions and guidelines in budgetary matters, and also
with COFIDE's medium-term programming.
The purpose of the latter is to formulate, coordinate and revise
the objectives, policies, plans and programs of COFIDE and also to establish
priorities for the use of funds, and the financial sources to which recourse
will be made. This programming shall be based on the policies established by
the Ministry of the Economy and Finance, and medium-term development plans.
3.1.2     When conditions permit, COFIDE shall contribute to the expansion of
the securities market, through the placement of COFIDE bonds and the sale of
shares it holds in portfolio.
3.1.3     COFIDE's total debt, including guarantees, less the amount of

basis that the average maturity of its loans and guarantees shall be equal
to or less than the average maturity of its obligations.
3.1.5          The Corporation shall diversify its loans and guarantees and
shall preferably avoid undertaking operations with a single "social property"
enterprise or reformed private enterprise in an amount in excess of 20% of
the paid-in capital and reserves of COFIDE. This will exclude operations with
the specific guarantee of the State or undertaken on behalf of the State.
3.1.6     The aggregate amount of equity investment by COFIDE may not exceed
the paid-in capital and reserves of the Corporation.
3.1.7     The objective of COFIDE's financial policy shall be, as far as

financial practices. It shall use a system for evaluating its portfolio
holdings that will enable it to build up sufficient reserves to cover loan
and guarantee risks, in addition to other types of provisions and accounting
reserves.  In the case of public enterprises, the fact of including provisions
for servicing of their debt with COFIDE in their biennial budgets shall be
considered sufficient guarantee.
3.1.12    The deadline for utilization of loans shall not exceed five months
after the last date for disbursement shown in the schedule submitted by the
enterprise and approved by COFIDE. The deadline for utilization of local
currency loans shall not exceed two years.

thle utilization period of contracts, advising the Board of Directors
accordingly.
3.2.2     Loans and endorsements for fixed assets shall be subject to a list

or in foreign currency, shall include a clause in the respective contract
that obliges beneficiary enterprises to pay the financial costs, commissions,
ot:her financial expenses and amortization of principal automatically, without
prior notification of payment due. In the event of failure to effect such
payments or amortization instalments, clause 3.2.6 of the General Policies
shall apply.

due and unpaid have been fully paid, without prejudice to the right to initiate
such legal action as may be appropriate, charges shall apply on the total
amount of the contract unpaid on the date on which an amount became overdue,

shall apply to the rates of interest charged under the refinanced loan.
3.2.6.4   If as a result of the default COFIDE should be obliged to have re-
course to external funds and the cost of these is greater than that originally

centage points per annum being applied in addition to said costs. Similarly,
any other cost resulting from said default shall also be passed on.

COFIDE - General Policy for Financial Intermediation (Draft)
I. OBJECTIVES
1.1       The purpose of this statement is to set forth the general
policy that will govern COFIDE's financial intermediation activities,
and to expand and develop the paragraph 1.1.5 in COFIDE's General
Policy Document. Therefore, the policies and procedures established
in this document are complementary to COFIDE's General Policy, which
will also apply to its financial intermediation operations.
1.2       These activities will be carried out through public and private
financial intermediaries and will be designed to :
1.2.1     Complement the public and private financial system in medium-
and long-term operations, to that end channeling funds from various
domestic and external sources, particularly to small- and medium-size
firms.
1.2.2     Promote projects contributing to national development, in
accordance with the policies of the government;
1.2.3     Help strengthen the country's financial system and the capital
markets, improve the capabilities of the financial intermediaries
authorized to carry out medium and long term lending operations to
appraise and supervise investment projects, and promote competition
among financial intermediaries, based on the quality of the service
provided and on equal opportunity in the use of financial resources
(particularly foreign) available.
II. GENERAL CONDITIONS
2.1       In order to plan and develop a general development policy,
COFIDE, through its financial intermediation activities, will finance
high priority sectoral and/or regional projects. The financial inter-
mediaries will take the credit risk in the operations to be financed,
and they will be fully responsible for the repayment of the subloans
to COFIDE, irrespective of the fulfillment of the repayment obligations
by the final borrowers.
2.2       COFIDE will obtain the necessary funds in local currency and
foreign exchange from various sources (at the lowest cost possible) in
order to meet existing demand; these funds will have to be channeled
through the system's financial institutions, under similar conditions,
for both the institutions themselves and the sub-borrowers.



ANNEX 2
p.2
-48-
2.3       The sub-borrowers will be able to use the funds to finance
expansion projects or new investments, i.e. to purchase capital goods
and finance permanent working capital associated with such new invest-
ments or expansion projects, or which can be expected to bring about
some increase in production.
2.4       The cost of the money, both local currency and foreign exchange,
should be consistent with the policy set by the Central Reserve Bank (BCR)
regarding interest rates and take into account COFIDEts cost in obtaining
and administering the funds, an adequate rate of return for the Corpora-
tion and the conditions of the financial market.
2.5       For operations in foreign currency, COFIDE will not take
any foreign exchange risk, and the interest rate to the financial
intermediary will cover, at least, the financial cost of the resources,
including the cost of mobilizing the resources and the foreign exchange
risk fee or premium when there is one, and a fee of at least 1% p.a.
to cover COFIDE's administrative costs. The interest rate to the
financial intermediaries for loans denominated in US dollars, including
those of special funds such as FONEX, FIRE, and FONCAP, will not be
less than 12% p.a. and will be periodically reviewed.
2.6       Likewise, a uniform policy will be established with regard to:
2.6.1     Amount and maximum duration of loans.
2.6.2     Proportion of each project to be financed:  COFIDE will
satisfy itself that the subprojects to be financed have an adequate
debt/equity ratio, which normally will not exceed 65/35 for the overall
firm including the proposed subloan. According to COFIDE's operating
policies and procedures (para. 1.2.5 of COFIDE's General Policy Statement),
COFIDE's total contributions, direct and indirect, will not exceed
75% of the total cost of the project, except in extraordinary circum-
stances.
2.6.3     Contributions by the financial intermediary and beneficiary:
In addition to the conditions established in para. 2.6.2 above, COFIDE
will require that the contributions of the financial intermediary and
the final borrower not be less than 10% of the total project in each
case.
2.7       Finally, COFIDE must observe the pertinent regulations
established by the BCR and take into account the financial soundness
of the sub-borrowers, with the possibility under certain circumstances
of promoting greater capitalization with the funds of the financial
intermediaries and/or COFIDE itself. In that event, the objective



ANNEX 2
p.3
- 49 -
will be to act as a promoter, i.e. such that in the shortest time
possible COFIDE will no longer be a shareholder, so that the capital
can be used to benefit other eligible enterprises.
III. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
3.1       The financial intermediaries eligible to use the COFIDE
system will be those legally authorized to make medium- and long-term
loans, including state development banks, finance companies and regional
banks. Exceptionally, other institutions may be used, with prior
authorization from the BCR, to carry out special programs, such as
the development of small businesses.
3.2       In order to participate in COFIDE's financial intermediation
system, the eligible intermediaries will have to satisfy all requirements
on risk concentration, maximum ratios of deposits, debts and guarantees
to equity, maximum loan sizes and other requirements established by
the Central Bank, and will also have to comply with the requirements
of the Superintendency of Banks. Moreover, COFIDE will satisfy itself
that the intermediaries follow sound financial policies and are credit-
worthy. COFIDE could establish limits to the resources lent to specific
intermediaries, and stop approving new subprojects in those cases
where the intermediaries do not follow the conditions established above.
3.3       The financial intermediaries will have to be able to handle
project appraisal and supervision, as well as implementation and
development. For this purpose, the intermediaries will submit to
COFIDE, together with the request for financing of a subproject, a
report covering the main technical, financial and economic characteristics
of the subproject, and the report will be reviewed by COFIDE.
3.4       COFIDE will take the necessary steps to ensure that the
financial intermediary functions are properly carried out, with
disbursements made promptly and each project followed up.
3.5       COFIDE will sign the pertinent intermediary contracts with
the eligible institutions.
IV. STRENGTHENING OF THE INTERMEDIATION SYSTEM
4.1       COFIDE's intermediation activities are designed to strengthen
and develop the financial sector in medium and long-term operations.
4.2       To that end, the counterpart of the financial institutions
must promote greater mobilization of savings, it being made a requirement
that funds used be obtained from sources of long-term savings.



ANNEX 2
p.4
- 50 -
4.3       COFIDE will contribute to improve the project appraisal and
supervision capabilities of the intermediaries through the subproject
review process, and through the provision of other technical assistance
activities, including seminars, specific assistance to intermediaries,
and other.
4.4       COFIDE will periodically monitor the performance of the
financial sector institutions specialized in medium and long-term
lending operations, including their resource mobilization, volume
of operations, profitability, efficiency and project appraisal and
supervision capabilities. Based on this information and analysis,
COFIDE will make its policy decisions in the area of financial inter-
mediation, and will make suggestions and recommendations to the Central
Bank for improving the financial system.
V. FINAL USERS
5.1       The promoters of the projects to be financed must be credit-
worthy and must have adequate technical knowledge and administrative
and management capabilities to carry out the projects.
5.2       The projects must be economically and financially viable and
have adequate guarantees.
5.3       The equipment, machinery and other goods and services needed
to carry out the projects to be financed will be acquired following
appropriate procurement procedures. The financial intermediaries will
satisfy themselves that the quality and prices of the goods and services
are adequate. COFIDE will monitor the procurement procedures established
by the intermediaries.
VI. PROMOTION
6.1       Once the government has established its development policies,
promotion should be used to generate sufficient demand.
6.2       COFIDE will provide adequate information to the financial
intermediaries and potential final borrowers on the resources available
requirements for access to such resources, and lending conditions.

1/  Affected refers to the company that is in arrears; that is, although a company with two or more loans may only be in arrears in one of them, it is here assumed that
all of the company's loans are affected.  Thus, the number of loans and corresponding amounts are those of the companies in arrears and not just the loans in arrears.
2/ Cossoissions on guarantees and penalty charges on arrears.
3/  State enterprises account for 76% of the loans and 60% of the amounts outstanding affected by arrears of less than 3 months.
4/ PETROPERU is presented separately because although in arrears over 12 months on some accounts, these accounts represent obligations it assumed from another enterprise                                      .
(ALAMBRESA) and which are in the process of being reviewed and renegotiated; thus, although technically in default, PETROPERU does niot serit being classed
as a risk based on arrears the cause of which is known and in the process of being corrected.

Other Assumptions
. Investments in basic industries are transfered to the government in 1981. The
transfer is financed by a 15 year loan (including two years of grace) to the govern-
ment, at an interest rate of 15% p.a.
After the transfer of basic industries, no capital contributions from the government
are included in the projections.
Foreign borrowings include the proposed Bank loan for US$60 million, a loan from
the IDB for US$30 million (currently under preparation) and other loans from foreign
commercial banks and export-import banks.
Local borrowings include Type C Bonds at market interest rate, and long term loans
from the Central Bank at the rediscount rate.
The financial projections have been prepared using the *DFCMOD computer program.
The starting conditions, detailed assumptions, decision file and several alternative
simulations are available in Project File.
