MEMORA2NDUM AND RECO)U(ENDATION OF THtE PRESIDENT
OF THE  INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RBECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUVRKY
FOR A NATIONAL EDUCATION DEmVLOPMENT PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to toe
Republic of Turkey for US$90.2 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would be for 17 years, including a five-year grace period,
at the Bank's standard varieble interest rate, and would help finance a
National Education Development Project.
2.    Bakgrond.  Turkey's economic performance during the early to mid-
1980s compared favorably with that of other middle income countries. The
country moved toward a market-based, outwardly oriented economy, inflation was
contained, the exports' share of gross national product (GNP) was tripled, and
international creditworthiness improved. However, since 1986, the economy has
been undergoing strain, with a sharp drop in the GNP growth rate, increasing
public sector budget deficits, ad a disturbingly high rate of inflation.  The
aovernment has been addressing these problems through various steps which
incluie, inter alia, measures to rejuvenate the private sector by irtroducing
new technology into manufacturing and commerce, develop small scale industries
for increased exports, and increase productivity of the labor force.
3.    Technological innovation and development has in the past been limited by
the relatively low level of education among the work force. With a 56X
enrollment of the middle school age-group in 1987 and a 681 pass/completion
rate less than 38X of today's work force entrants have as much as an eightl:
grade education. Further, with a 331 enrollment of the secondary school age-
group and a 71X pass completion rate, less than 231 of the current labor
market entrants have completeJ secondary education, and only about 8X of the
respective age-group are going or. for higher education. While the overall
enrollment ratios compare favorably with those of other middle income
countries, there has been concern about the quality of education and the level
of resources allocated to the sector. During the '80s, the education sector
accounted, on average, for about 131 of the Government's budget.
4.    Full realization of the country's long-term economic development goals
will depend in great measure on a well-educated, highly trained human resource
base with the knowledge, skills, and abilities, at all occupational levels, to
undertake the management functions required in the development process. This
implies the need for a highly diversified work force ranging from semi-
skilled to the highest levels of professional expertise. The basic and common
element which extends throughout all these levels of manpower preparation is
the need for a solid foundation in general education, i.e., social, -Aumeracy,
and literacy skills; critical thinking, analytical, and problem solving
abilities; capacity for creative and productive application of information;
and an understanding of the environment and its impact on society. Thus, a



- 2 -
sound school system, with a strong, high quality general education core, and
with equal access to both boys and girls, is fundamental to Turkey's overall
dr,velopment process.
5.    Based on the above rationale, the Government has iniriated a broad
education development program to raise the level of student learning and
achievement and, through such a program, the overall level of education in the
country. The program would focus on improving the quality of education,
increasing access to educational opportunity, and strengthening management of
the system. While the Government's education development program would be
relatively comprehensive in nature, covering all aspects of education,
including school construction, expansion of vocational education, education
for students with learning disabilities, etc., the proposed project would
focus on the quality enhancement and management aspects of the program.
Specifically, the project would assist the Ministry of Education (MOE) in
strengthening the overall framework for planning and decision making at both
the local and national levels as well as modernizing and improving curricula,
textbooks, instructional materials, classroom teaching skills (through
development of an in-service training capability), and management and
administrative skills and practices. It would also assist the Council of
Higher Education (YoK) in up-grading its university programs and capabilities
for the preparation of primary and secondary school teachers and other
education support personnel.  The project would be a vital part of the
Governmenc's first phase of its long-term sectoral development program.
6.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's previous support to Turkey's
education sector focused primarily on qualitative improvement and expansion of
vocational/technical education and manpower training. This was due mainly to
the Government's high priority of providing trained manpower support to the
productive sector and its previous reluctance to borrow for general education.
While Bank supported projects in vocational/technical education have been
generally successful, they have been intentionally limited in scope.
Continued dialogue with the Government has revealed the need for education
support of a much broader nature, resulting in the Bank's 1986 Education
Sector Survey Report which made a wide range of recommendations for sector
reform and improvement. The Government's own evaluation of the system confirms
the Report's major conclusions and presents a plan for reform based on its
recommendations. The proposed project covers an important segment of the
Government's sectoral development plan, and its scope and content are
consistent with the country's development potential and implementation
capacity. The Bank can make a substantial contribution through thl- operation
by helping to formulate the Government's sectoral development strategy and
assisting in tackling serious sectoral issues and problems.
7.    Prolect Objectives.  The proposed project objectives are: (a) to improve
the quality of primary and secondary education for increasing student
achievement; (b) to improve the quality and relevance of teacher education;
and (c) to improve management and administrative skills and practices in the
Ministry of Education.
8.    Prolect Description.  The proposed project supports the Government's
efforts to improve student learning and achievement throughout the country by



-3-
focusing on the following policy and operational measures for acnieving the
stated objectives:
a.    Qualitv of PriMar n ad SecondarA Education would be improved by
establishing a framevork for reviewing, up-grading, and up-dating
curricula, instructional materials, and evaluation procedures on a
continuing basis; following through on the first stages of
revising and u;-dating national curricula and textbooks:
strengthening capabilities for instructional materials design and
development; improving the system for textbook and materials
distribution; and strengthening the NOE's testing and evaluation
capabilities;
b.   Ogality and Relevance of Teacher Education would be improved by
revising and up-grading pre-service teacher training curricula,
textbooks, and instructional materials in the university Faculties
of Education; up-grading both teaching and research staff of the
Faculties; establishing a system for assessing development needs
of in-service teachers and other educational personnel; and
folloving through with appropriate training programs;
c.    Effectiveaess of Nanaement and Administration in the Ministry of
Education would be improved by establishing a rechanism for
strengthening internal communications within the MOE; initiating
an MOE management assessment and development program;
consolidating administrative units for increased management
efficiencies; expanding and improving the MOE management
information system (MIS); moving selected aspects of basic
planning and decision making to the provincial education
directorates; providing training for school administrators;
strengthening the MOE National Center for Research and Development
in Vo-Tech Education; and up-grading key staff of the MOE
Inspectorate.
9.    Prolect Costs and Financi.  The total cost of the proposed project, to
be implemented over a seven-year period, is estimated at US$177.2 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$90.2 million (51X). The
Bank would finance the foreign exchange component of the project. A breakdown
of the costs and financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and disbursement are included in Schedule B. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Turkey are provided in Schedules C and D, respectively. A Staff Appraisal
Report No. 8328-TU of January 10, 1990 is being distributed separately.
10. Actions Agreed. During negotiations, the Government provided assurances
that: (i) the policy adopted by NOE requiring teachers to participate in a
two-week intensive refresher course at least every five-years would be
formally implemented under the project; (ii) the Board of Education's initial
curriculum policy review and recommendations would be completed no later than
September 1, 1990; (iii) the MOE would make an assessment of the selected
curriculum laboratory schools' and computer experimental schools' facilities
and that local funds would be provided to renovate and furnish the respective



schools in accordance with recommendations for meeting mutually agreed
classroom standards; (iv) the studies on upgrading physical quality of
textbooks and implementing a textbook rental and/or used book re-sale scheme,
along with the project education studies would te completed by June 30, 1992.
or other date as warranted by circumstances; (v) no less than three qualified
specialists in tests and measurements would be recruited by September 1, 1991
to serve in the testing and evaluation division of the Education Research an!
Development Center; (vi) the Primary and Secondary Teacher Education Stee:ing
Committees would be formally established by September 1, 1990; (vii) the
project accounts would be audited annually; and (viii) a plan for annual
assessment of implementation progress and for a final evaluation of the
project would be developed by the NOE and YoK project coordination units and
reviewed with the Bank no later than December 31, 1990. It was agreed that
there would be an annual Government-Bank review of project implementation vith
a view to agreeing on resource requiremenis and other actions necessary for
the subsequent year to achieve the project objectives. It was also agreed
that establishment of the Y6k project coordinating unit and formal appointment
of the required four project implementation specialists would be a condition
of disbursement for the Y6k project component.
11.   Benefits. The proposed project would be the first step in establishing
appropriate standards of quality in the education sector to raise the level of
humar. resources as required ' r achievement of its national development
objectives. It would be a m&jor undertaking in institution building and for
promoting quality edtucation to enable the country to compete in the World
Market. And finally, it would improve and strengthen education services,
i.e., extend the school year by about 14X, extend basic educatior from 5 to 8
years, require primiry teachers to be trained at the university level, promote
teacher participation in refresher and up-date t aining, and implement
measures to improve ccat effectiveness in the ee cation system, including a
shift of textbook printing to the private sectc   and the gradual delegation
of more planning and decision making authority    the provincial levels.
12.  Risks. There is the risk of budget allocations not keeping pace with the
proposed new emphasis on high quality education. However, the education
sector has received an increase in total budget allocations during each of the
past three years, the Treasury has indicated that this is a high priority
investment project for the Government, and the recurrent costs of the proposed
operation are relatively low, so this risk is considered to be minimal. There
is a risk that political pressures may make it difficult to take appropriate
measures for bringing about operational and financial efficiencies in the
sector, i.e., declaring teaching positions in some schools redundant where
appropriate, re-deployment of teachers and administrators from areas of excess
personnel to locations/schools where shortages exist, etc. However, present
procedures already recognize the need to provide special incentives to
educational personnel to induce them to work in less attractive areas of the
country, and hence the risk of political pressure is considered minimal.
