A. 
Project Development Objective 
1. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
project 
seeks 
two 
development objectives: 
(i) 
to 
reduce 
non-tariff 
costs 
to 
trade 
and 
transport; 
and 
(ii) 
to 
increase revenue and 
compliance, 
and 
reduce 
smuggling 
and 
corruption 
at 
border 
crossings. 
The 
project 
will 
achieve 
these 
objectives 
by: 
(i) 
strengthening 
Customs 
institutional 
capacity; 
(ii) 
modernizing and integrating 
Customs 
information 
systems 
for 
border processing 
and clearance 
of 
shipments; 
(iii) 
developing 
a 
transit 
control 
system; 
(iv) 
upgrading 
the capacity and 
effectiveness 
of 
existing border 
points; 
(v) 
improving 
mechanisms 
of 
interaction and 
cooperation 
between border control 
agencies 
and the trading 
community; 
(vi) 
disseminating 
information 
and 
providing 
training 
to 
the 
trading 
community 
(private 
sector); 
and 
(vii) 
implementing, 
at 
pilot 
sites, 
an 
integrated 
set 
of 
new 
Customs 
procedures, 
information 
technology, 
human 
resource management techniques, 
and cooperation 
mechanisms 
for 
agencies 
at 
border 
crossings. 
Like 
other 
participants 
in 
the 
TTFSE 
program 
- 
though 
to 
a lesser 
extent 
- 
Moldova 
receives 
assistance 
from 
the 
European 
Union 
(EU) 
to 
support 
the 
modernization 
of 
its 
Department 
of 
Customs. 
As 
recognized 
by 
the 
Government, the process 
necessary 
to 
change 
institutional 
cultures 
and ingrained 
behavior 
is 
expected 
to 
take 
a 
substantial 
time, 
about 
8 
to 
10 
years. 
The 
modernization 
process 
involves 
simultaneous 
and 
sustained actions 
on 
development 
by 
the 
Moldovan 
Department 
of 
Customs 
(MDC) 
of 
an internal 
strategic 
planning 
process 
including: 
(i) 
change 
in 
administrative and operational 
procedures; 
(ii) 
definition 
of 
staff profiles 
for 
the 
organization and 
hiring, 
training 
or 
deployment according 
to 
them; 
(iii) 
elaboration 
and implementation 
of 
a 
staff 
development plan; and 
(iv) 
upgrading 
of 
infomation 
technology 
and regional 
interconnection. 
This 
project 
will 
provide 
support 
to 
implement 
the 
Customs 
reform 
at 
border 
crossings 
and 
inland 
terminals 
during 
the 
first 
phase 
(four 
years) 
of 
the 
process. 
The 
process 
does 
not 
directly include 
Transnistria 
although 
it 
addresses, 
through 
the reorganization 
of 
Customs 
control 
over 
transit, 
the 
issue 
of 
goods 
smuggled 
from 
Moldova 
into 
and out 
of 
Transnistria. 
2. 
Key 
performance 
indicators: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Progress 
towards the objectives 
will 
be 
monitored 
by 
three 
broad 
types 
of 
performance indicators. 
The 
first 
set 
will 
measure 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
Regional Program 
by 
monitoring, 
through 
users 
surveys, 
the cost 
and 
time required 
for 
a 
standard 
full 
truck 
load 
shipment 
traveling 
on 
three 
regional 
itineraries, and 
the 
occurrence 
of 
"petty" payments 
for 
facilitation. 
The 
second 
set 
will 
focus 
on 
the 
overall ratios 
of 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
MDC 
(such 
as 
trade 
volume 
per 
staff, revenue 
collected 
by 
Customs 
compared 
to 
total 
Customs 
cost). 
The 
third 
set 
will 
focus 
on 
performance 
of 
all 
border 
agencies 
at 
selected 
pilot 
sites, 
and their 
total 
impact 
on 
users. 
Indicators 
at 
pilot 
sites 
include: 
(i) 
number 
of 
physical 
or 
documentary examinations and 
their 
effectiveness; 
(ii) 
total 
processing time; 
(iii) 
number 
of 
vehicles 
processed 
within 
a 
standard 
processing time; 
and 
(iii) 
occurrence 
of 
corruption. 
The 
following 
pilot 
sites 
have been 
selected based 
on 
traffic 
volumes, 
reported 
big 
delays, 
strategic 
importance 
of 
the 
site, 
and 
neighboring 
country: 
Chisinau (inland 
terminal), 
Leuseni and Cahul 
(border 
crossings 
to 
Romania), 
and 
Palanka (border 
crossing 
to 
Ukraine). 
Monitoring 
will 
use 
the 
standard 
TTFSE 
methodology 
and 
definition 
for 
each 
indicator 
to 
ensure 
consistency 
and 
comparability 
with 
other countries 
in 
the 
region 
(http://WWW.seerecon.org/RegionaIInitiatives/TTFSE/TTFSE_Manual.pdf). 
Several 
series 
of 
measurements 
have 
taken 
place 
at 
pilot 
sites 
during 
project 
preparation 
to 
establish 
the 
baseline figures 
and projections.

with 
the objectives 
(ii) 
and 
(iii) 
above. 
It 
will 
help 
MDC 
to 
better 
serve 
trade 
activities 
by 
reducing 
non-tariff 
transport 
costs, 
lowering 
the 
price 
of 
imported 
goods, 
and 
improving 
the 
competitiveness 
of 
Moldovan 
products, 
thereby 
promoting 
private 
sector 
growth 
and 
creation 
of 
new 
jobs 
in 
the 
country. 
The project 
will 
also support 
the 
MDC 
in 
strengthening 
its 
tax 
collection 
capacity, 
while 
reinforcing 
on-going efforts 
against 
corruption and 
towards 
improving 
transparency 
of 
border 
procedures. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
The 
TTFSE: 
Key 
Design 
Concepts 
This 
TTFSE 
project 
is 
part 
of 
a 
regional 
program 
in 
Southeast 
Europe, 
involving 
Albania, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, 
Bulgaria, 
Croatia, 
FYR 
Macedonia, 
Romania, 
the 
Federal 
Republic 
of 
Yugoslavia, and 
the 
Republic 
of 
Moldova 
aimed 
to 
strengthen 
their 
mutual 
cooperation 
to 
foster 
trade 
in 
Southeast 
Europe 
and 
with 
its 
main 
trading 
partners, 
whde 
reducing 
smuggling 
and corruption at border 
crossings, 
through 
a 
set 
of 
coordinated 
and 
simultaneous measures 
under 
the 
Tmde and 
Transport 
Facilitation 
in 
Southeast 
Europe 
(TTFSE)  Program. 
Th 
effort  was 
initiated 
by 
the 
Southeast 
Europe Cooperative 
Initiative. 
The 
TTFSE 
Program 
aims 
at 
supporting 
the 
efforts 
of 
these 
countries 
in 
modernizing 
border 
agencies 
and 
in 
particular their 
Customs 
Administrations 
in 
line 
with 
EU 
practice. The 
Program 
builds 
notably 
on 
a 
number 
of 
regional 
mechanisms 
: 
(i) 
a 
high-level 
Regonal 
Steering 
Committee 
gathering 
all 
countries, 
meeting 
generally 
twice 
a 
year, 
to 
facilitate 
cooperation 
and 
experience sharing (seven meetings 
to 
date); 
(ii) 
a 
regional 
website 
presenting 
all 
requirements 
and 
procedures 
of 
border 
agemies; 
(iii) 
public-private 
working 
groups 
interacting 
quarterly 
(PRO-Committees); 
(iv) 
regional conventional and 
distance 
learning programs 
to 
harmonize the 
quality 
of 
transport service providers; 
and 
(v) 
paired local 
project 
teams gathering 
all 
border 
agencies 
at pilot 
border 
crossing 
points 
with 
interactions 
across 
the border. 
The 
TTFSE 
projects 
are 
part 
of 
the 
ht 
of 
Quick-Start 
projects defmed 
under the 
Stability Pact. 
Background 
Trade 
is 
highly 
significant 
to 
the economy 
of 
Moldova, 
equivalent 
to 
over 95 percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
the 
last 
years (1998-2002). 
Moldova 
has 
established 
an open 
trade 
regime. 
Its 
trade 
performance 
in 
goods 
is 
affected 
by 
a 
few 
major 
features: 
(i) 
high 
concentration 
of 
both 
exports and 
imports 
on 
CIS 
countries; 
(ii) 
-4- 
Page  9
high 
dependence 
on 
energy 
imports 
(especially 
gas 
from 
Russia), 
and 
(iii) 
high 
concentration 
of 
exports 
on 
agncultural 
commodities, 
with 
food 
and 
vegetable 
products accounting 
for 
nearly 
60 
percent 
of 
sales 
abroad. 
Textiles 
are 
the country’s 
second 
largest 
export 
earner 
outside agriculture. 
Although 
Moldova 
has 
increased 
its 
exports 
to 
all 
other 
major trading 
partners, 
it 
remains 
dependent 
on 
Russia 
as 
its 
major 
sales 
market. 
Russia 
accounts 
for 
about 
44 
percent 
of 
export 
destinations, 
followed 
by 
EU 
countries 
(22%) 
and 
neighboring 
Romania 
(about 
10%). 
On 
the 
import 
side, 
mineral 
products, 
machinery 
and 
equipment 
represent about 
41 
percent 
of 
Moldovan 
imports 
in 
the 
year 2001, 
with 
Romania, 
Ukraine 
and 
Russia 
being 
the 
main 
partners (nearly 
45 
percent 
of 
import 
origins). 
The 
trends 
look 
the 
same 
for 
2002, 
reflecting 
the narrowness 
of 
Moldova’s 
trade patterns. 
Corruption 
is 
perceived 
as 
pervasive 
in 
the 
Moldovan 
public 
sector, 
with 
a 
harmful 
impact 
on all 
aspects 
of 
economic 
and 
social 
development. 
Corrupt 
practices 
within 
the tax and 
Customs 
bodies 
cause 
significant 
damage 
to 
the Government’s budget 
through reducing 
revenue 
collection. 
Huge 
potential 
revenue 
losses 
in 
the 
energy 
sector 
are suspected, 
as 
well 
as 
significant 
revenue 
losses 
resulting 
from 
petrol 
and cigarette 
smuggling. 
Transnistria. 
The 
internal 
dispute over the 
status 
of 
the 
Transnistria 
region 
(which 
declared 
independence 
in 
1994 
but 
has 
not 
been recognized 
by 
the 
central 
government) 
left Moldova 
separated 
de 
facto 
into 
two 
parts 
and 
created huge 
opportunities 
for 
smuggling 
and 
corruption 
due 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
effective 
control 
of 
the 
Moldovan 
authorities over 
its 
eastern 
border 
with 
Ukraine. 
Although 
Transnistria 
covers 
only 
about 
12 
percent 
of 
Moldova’s 
territory, 
the 
region 
is 
of 
high 
economic 
importance 
for 
the 
country and 
straddles 
the 
major land 
routes 
to 
Russia 
and 
other strategically 
important export 
markets. 
The 
Transnistrian authorities have 
created 
their 
own 
army, 
Customs, 
and 
police, and they 
maintain 
a 
distinct 
trade 
regime. 
Excessive 
logistical 
costs 
affect 
traders 
in 
Moldova, 
like 
in 
most 
of 
the 
region, 
for 
their 
export, 
import 
and transit 
operations. 
The 
flow 
of 
international 
truck traffic 
reaching 
Moldova 
is 
relatively 
limited 
with 
about 280-320 
trucks per 
day 
for 
import, 
export and transit 
at 
all 
its 
crossings 
combined. 
Transit 
has 
dropped 
significantly 
over the recent 
years 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
relatively 
high 
costs 
(transit fee 
of 
$1 
10 
for 
350 
km), 
bureaucratic 
procedures, 
and 
poor 
road 
infrastructure. Transport 
to or 
through 
Ukraine 
creates a 
particular 
challenge 
due 
to 
the imbalance between 
Ukrainian 
small 
needs 
for 
transit 
permits 
through 
Moldova, 
compared 
to 
the need 
for 
Moldovan 
operators 
to 
transit 
toward 
Russia 
(the 
main 
export market 
for 
Moldova) through 
Ukraine. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
number 
of 
transit 
permits 
through 
Ukraine 
is 
insufficient. 
It 
creates 
an opportunity 
for 
a 
non-transparent secondary 
market 
for 
permits 
where 
permits 
can 
be resold 
for 
$100-200 against 
their 
$10 nominal 
cost. 
Their 
limited 
number 
is 
also 
a 
significant 
source 
of 
concern 
toward 
EU 
countries. 
Waiting 
time 
at 
border crossing 
points 
on 
the 
western side 
of 
Moldova 
is 
of 
3-4 
hours under 
the 
current 
low 
levels 
of 
traffic. 
Clearance 
of 
goods 
seems 
slow 
in 
Moldova, 
but 
can 
be very 
long 
in 
Ukraine 
(24-48  hours). 
Nonetheless, 
the 
absence 
of 
certified 
customs 
brokers 
- 
despite 
a 
law 
establishing 
their 
status 
- 
affects 
freight 
forwarding 
negatively. 
The 
lack 
of 
consolidation 
of 
controls 
was 
raised 
as 
a 
significant 
concern 
by 
traders 
and 
road 
transport 
operators. 
This 
problem 
is 
even 
more 
acute 
at 
the border 
with 
Ukraine. 
Pre-Shipment Inspection 
(PSl). 
The 
agreement 
was 
signed 
between 
the 
Government 
and 
Societe 
Generale de 
Surveillance 
(SGS) 
at 
the end 
of 
2001 
and, 
came 
into 
force 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
2002 
as 
a 
condition 
to 
a 
Stand-by 
Agreement 
with 
the 
IMF. 
The rationale 
for 
PSI 
is 
that 
corrupt 
practices 
in 
Customs 
and insufficient 
training 
eroded 
significantly 
the 
duty-base. 
The 
declared purpose 
of 
the 
PSI 
agreement 
is 
to 
facilitate 
trade 
while 
minimizing 
opportunities 
for 
fraud and fiscal 
evasion 
related 
to 
import 
operations. 
While 
credited 
for improving import 
tax 
revenue, the 
PSI 
system 
has 
proved 
unpopular 
with 
many 
importers, and 
its 
results 
are 
controversial. 
A 
law 
was passed 
by 
the Parliament 
in 
March 
2003 
which 
allows 
for 
competition 
in 
the inspection 
service, 
and 
establishes a 
range 
of 
goods 
exempted 
from 
PSI, 
renewable every 
year. 
The 
law 
has 
not 
been 
found 
acceptable 
by 
the 
IMF. 
While 
-5- 
Page  10
SGS 
has 
identified 
several 
cases 
of 
capital 
flight, 
the 
main 
purpose 
of 
PSI 
may 
not 
yet 
have 
been 
fully 
achieved, 
thus 
further 
justifying 
strengthening 
of 
the 
MDC’s 
valuation and 
post-release 
capacity. 
Issues 
a. 
Customs 
Procedures 
and 
Operations 
The 
MDC 
has 
a 
relatively 
low 
level 
of 
productivity 
compared 
to 
other countries 
in 
the 
region. 
The 
average 
number 
of 
declarations processed 
per 
officer 
in 
one 
year 
is 
between 
70 
and 
100 
(regional 
average: 
300), 
except 
in 
Chisinau, 
where 
it 
is 
200. 
Work 
positions 
are 
reportedly 
over-staffed. 
Although 
processing 
of 
goods 
and 
vehicles, 
both 
inland 
and 
at the border, 
is 
relatively 
fast, 
(i) 
this 
is 
not 
due 
to 
the 
multiplicity 
of 
staff, 
and 
(ii) 
it 
is 
unlikely to 
be 
sustained 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
strong 
increase 
in 
traffic. 
Clearance 
of 
goods 
either 
takes 
place at 
the border, 
or 
at 
a 
few 
inland 
terminals where importers 
or 
their 
agents are 
registered. 
In 
that 
second 
case, 
goods 
travel 
under 
a 
transit 
document, 
which 
may 
be 
a 
TIR 
camet, 
and 
must 
be 
reported 
at 
an inland 
Customs 
location 
within 
72 
hours. 
Excised 
goods can 
only 
be 
cleared 
at 
the 
border.  There 
are 
no 
Customs 
brokers 
as 
such 
- 
although 
the Customs 
code 
provides 
for 
them 
- 
but 
intermediaries 
(called 
“Economic 
Agents”) 
can 
lodge 
declarations 
on 
behalf 
of 
importers. 
This 
system 
is 
not 
altogether transparent, 
because 
Customs 
do 
not 
usually 
have 
the 
ability to 
prosecute 
the 
Economic 
Agents, 
and the 
real 
importers 
are 
often 
difficult 
to 
identify. 
The inland 
clearance 
process 
is 
lengthy, 
and the 
format 
of 
the declaration 
is 
only 
partly 
aligned 
on 
the 
Single 
Administrative 
Document 
(SAD);  the 
codes 
used 
may not be 
according 
to 
international 
standards. 
Each 
declaration 
is 
subject 
to 
a 
documentary 
verification, 
followed 
by 
a 
physical inspection 
in 
fifty 
to 
sixty 
percent 
of 
the 
cases. 
Moldova’s 
Customs system 
is 
relatively 
young; 
it 
was 
set 
up 
upon 
the 
country’s 
declaration 
of 
independence 
in 
1991. Since 
then the 
Government 
has 
taken 
various 
steps 
to 
improve 
customs 
legislation, 
procedures 
and 
documentation. Starting last 
year, 
the 
MDC 
reports 
directly 
to 
the Cabinet 
(Prime 
Minister). 
It 
operates 
under 
a 
streamlined, 
EU-compatible 
Customs 
code 
providing 
in 
particular 
for: 
(i) 
selective 
examination 
of 
declarations; 
(ii) 
post-release 
reviews; 
(iii) 
electronic 
or 
other 
filing; 
(iv) 
Customs 
processing 
fee; 
and 
(v) 
deferred 
payment, together 
with 
a 
Customs 
service 
law 
which 
provides 
the 
MDC 
with 
wide 
- 
and 
autonomous 
- 
powers 
of 
control 
and enforcement throughout 
the 
territory. 
One 
of 
the 
more 
advanced features 
of 
MDC’s 
operations 
is 
the 
Single 
Window 
system 
of 
payment 
currently 
being 
tested at 
Sculeni border 
crossing. 
It 
includes Customs 
clearance, 
inspections, 
and duties 
payment 
services 
in 
a 
single 
payment 
window 
. 
It 
is 
supported 
by 
a 
Govemment 
regulation 
of 
August 
2000, 
and 
is 
to 
be 
extended 
to all 
the 
major 
Customs points. 
(b) 
In 
formation 
Systems 
and Border 
Facilities 
The 
Customs’ 
information 
systems are obsolete. 
The local 
area 
networking 
capabilities 
are 
modest, 
based 
on 
relatively 
old 
technology. 
The 
software 
and 
hardware 
tools 
used 
are 
mostly 
outdated and 
sometimes 
incompatible, 
and 
the 
telecommunication 
tools 
need 
upgrading. 
Several 
computer applications 
for 
clearance 
and 
back-office 
operations 
are 
developed internally, 
and they 
are 
modest 
in 
functionality. 
Customs 
developed 
a 
computerized 
data 
base 
for 
trade 
statistics. 
Statistical reports 
are 
produced 
quarterly, 
usually 
about one 
month 
after 
the 
end 
of 
each 
quarter. 
The Information 
and 
Telecommunication 
Technology 
(ITT) 
central 
unit 
is 
small 
(about 
17 
people) 
and 
divided 
into 
four 
sections: 
(i) 
information control 
(processing); 
(ii) 
statistics; 
(iii) 
telecommunication 
and computer 
engineering; 
and 
(iv) 
programming 
and 
implementation. Basic software 
used 
includes Foxpro, Clipper, 
Window 
and 
Oracle. 
Old 
versions 
of 
communication 
software 
are 
based 
mostly 
on 
Novel. 
The 
pilot 
software 
application, “Frontiera” 
was developed 
by 
the 
ITT 
staff.

Stakeholders 
reported their 
concern 
on 
the 
complexity 
and 
time 
required 
for 
the processing 
of 
documents, 
including waiting 
time 
at 
borders, 
as 
well 
as 
on 
the 
inadequate Customs 
information 
system. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
main 
border 
crossing 
points 
lack 
the appropriate capacity and equipment 
to 
ensure 
effectiveness 
of 
operations. 
(c) 
Smuggling 
and 
Corruption 
Opportunities 
At 
the highest 
level 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Moldova 
there 
is 
a 
clear 
recognition 
of 
the 
serious 
problem 
represented 
by 
corruption 
and 
bribes 
in 
the 
country. 
The 
issue 
is 
more 
serious 
as 
it 
extends 
well 
beyond 
a 
certain 
government 
body or 
agency 
(e.g. 
Customs) because 
of 
the 
high 
tolerance 
for 
corruption 
in 
Moldovan 
society, 
the 
lack 
of 
transparency 
in 
Government's transactions, the 
outmoded 
country 
legislation, 
lack 
of 
a 
clear 
Anti-corruption 
Strategy 
(or 
commitment to apply 
it), 
and 
a 
high 
degree 
of 
discretionary 
authority. 
At 
the 
Stability 
Pact 
Conference 
on 
Practical 
Steps 
Against 
Corruption 
and 
Organized 
Crime 
in 
Southeastern 
Europe organized 
in 
Chisinau 
in 
200 
1, 
the Government 
underlined 
that 
the 
key 
to 
change 
in 
Moldova 
is 
linked 
to 
creating 
a 
new 
national culture 
of 
integrity 
through 
educational 
and 
public 
relations 
programs. 
Despite the 
efforts 
of 
the 
MDC 
and 
the 
Government, 
various institutes and 
nonprofit 
organizations 
in 
Moldova 
involved 
in 
the analysis 
and dissemination 
of 
public 
policy 
issues 
(Institute 
of 
Public 
Policy, 
the Center 
for 
Strategic 
Studies 
and 
Reforms, 
Transparency International) 
report 
that 
Customs 
is 
still 
perceived 
as 
the most corrupt 
of 
all 
government 
agencies. 
Stakeholders have also 
reported 
that 
there 
is 
some 
level 
of 
tacit collaboration 
between 
some 
staff 
in 
Customs 
and 
smuggling 
operations. 
Private 
traders 
consider 
payment 
of 
better 
salaries 
to 
Customs 
officer 
as 
essential 
to 
address 
the 
issue, 
but 
additional 
steps 
should 
also 
be 
considered. 
Smuggling activities 
in 
Transnistria affect 
legitimate 
trade 
through unfair 
competition (notably 
for 
oil, 
oil 
products, 
alcohol, 
and 
cigarettes). 
Transnistria 
has 
become 
a 
separate 
Customs 
territory,  and the 
MDC 
does 
not 
have 
access 
to 
the 
border 
between Transnistria 
and Ukraine, 
which 
is 
now 
the 
main 
route 
for 
smuggling 
into Moldova. 
To 
combat 
this, 
the 
authorities 
had 
established 
fiscal 
checkpoints 
along 
the 
Nistru 
River 
where 
excise 
duties 
in 
particular were 
collected. 
This 
system, 
which 
did 
not 
operate 
satisfactorily 
and 
generated 
opportunities 
for 
corruption, 
was 
discontinued. 
Other 
solutions 
are 
being 
explored, 
like 
the proposed 
joint 
Customs 
and 
border guard patrols 
operated 
by 
both Moldova 
and 
Ukraine 
on 
the 
Ukrainian 
side 
of 
the border. 
This 
scheme has 
not 
yet 
started 
to 
be 
operational, 
and 
is 
pending 
agreement 
between 
Moldova, 
Ukraine, 
Russia, 
and the Transnistrian authorities. 
The 
MDC 
has 
wide 
powers 
of 
enforcement, 
including 
away 
from 
the 
border, 
which 
are 
indispensable 
for 
preventing and 
detecting 
smuggling. 
However, the 
Department lacks 
the 
necessary resources, 
equipment, 
and 
training 
to 
carry 
out 
mobile 
checks 
as 
frequently 
as 
would 
be 
necessary, 
thus 
leaving 
this 
aspect 
of 
Customs operations 
to 
other 
law 
enforcement 
agencies 
-with 
the 
risk 
that 
the 
MDC 
may 
lose 
permanently 
its 
powers. 
(d) 
Border 
inter-agency 
awareness 
and cooperation 
The 
current 
system 
is 
affected 
by 
insufficient coordination 
in 
terms 
of 
border 
management. 
The 
implementation 
of 
an 
integrated border 
management system 
involves 
numerous 
components 
and 
actors. 
The 
veterinary 
and 
phyto-sanitary 
services, 
as 
well 
as 
the roads 
administration and border 
troops 
maintain offices 
at 
borders. 
Although 
the 
MDC 
has tested, 
with 
good 
results, 
the single 
window 
payment 
system 
- 
which 
shows 
that 
the 
various border 
agencies 
have 
a 
working 
dialogue, 
and 
that 
new 
procedures 
-7- 
Page  12
are 
better 
tested 
on 
a 
pilot 
site basis 
- 
additional 
sensitization 
in 
procedures 
would 
be 
useful. 
(e) 
Private-Public Interactions 
and 
the 
Delivery 
of 
Transport and 
Trade 
Services 
The perception 
of 
traders 
at 
an 
operational 
level 
(border 
post, 
clearance 
terminal) 
is 
that 
border 
agencies 
do 
not 
focus 
on 
collectively 
improving 
the services 
they 
provide 
to 
traders 
and 
society. 
The 
International Association 
of 
Road 
Hauliers 
of 
Moldova 
(AITA), 
created 
in 
1992, has 
been an 
active 
member 
of 
the 
International 
Road 
Transport 
Union 
(IRU) 
since 
1994, 
delivering 
TIR 
carnets 
on 
the 
territory 
of 
Moldova 
as 
the 
national 
guarantee 
association 
(19,600 
camets 
in 
2000). 
AITA 
works 
closely 
with 
the Customs 
Administration 
and the 
Ministry 
or 
Transport 
and 
Communications 
to 
address 
impediments 
to 
international 
transport. 
Quarterly consultative meetings 
are 
organized 
by 
the 
Government. 
AITA 
has 163 
members 
with 
a 
total 
fleet 
of 
4,300 
vehicles. 
The 
road 
fleet 
consists 
primarily 
of 
EURO 
1 
and 
EURO 
2 
trucks. 
Only 
2 1 
percent 
of 
members 
have 
more 
than 
15 
vehicles. 
Its 
database 
includes 
3,000 
international 
drivers. 
AITA 
provides 
training 
for 
transport managers 
and 
international 
drivers (Certificate 
of 
Professional 
Competence) 
through 
its 
professional 
training 
center 
(CIPTI). 
The training 
center established 
under 
a 
TACIS 
program 
has been 
recognized 
by 
the 
IRU 
Academy. 
AITA 
provides urgent 
information 
by 
email 
to 
its 
members and 
has a 
database 
containing 
the 
set 
of 
existing 
requirements. 
The 
Chamber 
of 
Commerce 
and 
Industry 
(CCI) 
was established 
only 
in 
1999. 
Membership 
is 
mandatory 
for 
large 
companies, 
while 
it 
is 
optional 
for 
small 
companies. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
CCI 
members represent 
85 
percent 
of 
production 
and 
exports. 
The 
CCI 
has a 
website 
maintained 
by 
four 
of 
its 
staff. 
All 
surrounding countries have 
Pro-committees, 
and the 
procedures 
of 
creating 
MOLD-Pro 
has 
recently 
been 
initiated 
by 
the 
CCI. The 
Pro-Committees 
were 
recommended 
by 
the 
UNCEFACT 
as 
instruments 
for 
public-private 
dialogue 
on 
trade 
and 
transport 
facilitation. 
They 
gather 
members 
of 
various 
border 
agencies 
and ministries, 
of 
the trading 
and 
transport communities, 
and 
professional 
associations, 
and 
are 
usually 
organized under the leadership 
of 
chambers 
of 
commerce. 
They 
hold 
meetings 
and carry 
out 
actions 
of 
shared 
interest 
such 
as 
issuance 
of 
information 
on 
border 
crossing 
procedures, 
or 
setting 
up 
of 
region-wide 
working 
groups 
on 
e-commerce 
or 
simplification 
of 
procedures. 
In 
the 
TTFSE 
countries the 
Pro-committees 
are 
important 
partners 
of 
the 
regional 
program. 
(e) 
Regional 
Cooperation 
Road 
transport operators 
in 
Moldova 
are 
reportedly 
constrained 
by 
the 
policies 
of 
its 
trading 
partners 
regarding transit permits, transit 
fees, visa, 
and 
the 
complex and costly 
procedures 
for 
access 
to 
the 
road 
transport 
markets 
(licensing). 
The 
number 
of 
available 
permits to/through Ukraine, 
Hungary, 
and 
the 
EU 
countries 
is 
only 
a 
limited 
fraction 
of 
what 
is 
required. 
Government 
strategy 
The 
Government 
and 
MDC 
are 
strongly 
committed 
to 
reforming 
the 
institution 
of 
Customs. 
A 
Development 
Action 
Plan 
for 
the 
reform 
process was 
prepared 
by 
MDC 
and approved 
by 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
in 
February 
2002. 
The Plan 
is 
based 
on 
the 
major 
operational objectives 
of 
MDC: 
(a) 
modernizing 
Customs procedures 
and 
operations; 
(b) 
upgrading 
information 
systems 
and 
border 
facilities; 
(c) 
reducing 
smuggling 
and 
corruption 
opportunities; 
(d) 
strengthening 
border 
inter-agency 
awareness 
and 
cooperation; 
(e) 
improving 
private-public 
interactions 
and 
the 
delivery 
of 
transport 
and 
trade 
services; 
and 
(f) 
strengthening 
regional 
cooperation. 
The 
MDC 
plays 
a 
critical role 
in 
serving 
both 
the 
State 
and the 
trading community. 
Customs 
collect 
about 50% 
percent 
of 
total 
budget 
revenues (about 
-a- 
Page  13
$183 
million 
equivalent 
in 
2002). 
Moldova, 
like 
all 
other participants 
in 
the South European Cooperative 
Initiative 
(SECI), 
recognizes 
the 
importance 
of 
coordinated 
actions 
to 
address 
the 
above 
issues 
and 
achieve 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
Stability 
Pact. 
It 
is 
also 
recognized 
that, 
to 
some degree, 
each 
country 
can 
expect 
to 
gain 
more 
from 
actions 
to 
be 
taken 
by 
the 
neighboring 
countries 
than 
those 
taken 
by 
the 
country 
itself. 
A 
regional 
view 
has 
thus 
emerged, 
according to 
which 
participant 
countries 
would 
simultaneously 
apply 
coordinated and 
compatible 
measures 
to 
reduce tradekransport impediments and 
cormptiodsmuggling 
opportunities. 
The 
regional 
cohesion 
is 
symbolized 
by 
the 
signing 
of 
the 
regional 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding 
by 
the 
eight 
TTFSE 
program 
countries, 
as 
well 
as 
their willingness to 
benchmark 
country 
performance and 
to 
work 
on 
streamlined solutions 
at 
border 
crossings. 
The 
support 
of 
the 
EU 
and 
of 
such 
bilateral 
donors 
as 
the 
US, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
collaboration 
with 
the 
United 
Nations 
Economic Commission 
for 
Europe 
(UN-ECE) 
reflect 
the importance 
attached 
to 
the development 
and stabilization 
of 
the 
region. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
The 
project 
will 
support 
the 
MDC 
Development 
Action 
Plan 
by 
addressing 
the 
issues 
described 
above, 
building 
on 
previous efforts 
and 
taking 
full 
account 
of 
other 
existing 
and 
future 
external support 
(EU, 
SGS, 
USAID, 
etc.) 
to 
avoid 
any duplication. 
The modernization 
of 
procedures 
and 
operations 
through 
the 
proposed 
project 
will 
focus 
on 
simplified 
and 
standardized 
Customs 
and 
border 
inspection 
procedures, 
including 
selective 
inspections 
and 
targeted 
checks 
based 
on 
risk 
assessment, 
introduction 
of 
audits 
and 
account management 
processing 
to 
facilitate 
trade 
data exchanges, 
training 
for 
Customs 
staff 
to 
ensure 
the 
uniform 
application 
of 
legislation 
and 
to 
enhance 
integrity. 
Upgrading 
of 
information 
systems 
have been 
identified 
as 
priorities 
in 
the 
MDC 
Development 
Action 
Plan. 
The 
Customs 
ITT 
staff 
reports 
that there 
would 
be 
a 
40% 
to 
50% 
increase 
in 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
MDC 
if 
a 
new 
integrated 
system 
were introduced. 
The 
complex 
and 
time consuming 
document 
processing, 
and border 
long 
waiting 
times 
will 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
through 
the development 
of 
an 
Integrated Customs 
Clearance 
Information 
System (ICCIS) 
to 
include acquisition and implementation 
of 
a 
modern 
software 
system 
(ASYCUDA) 
for 
Customs 
clearance 
and related 
activities, 
compatible 
with 
international 
norms 
and 
procedures, 
and especially 
those 
of 
the 
EU 
and 
neighboring trading 
partners; 
and 
computerization 
of 
MDC 
including 
replication 
of 
the "Frontiera"  and other software 
modules 
to 
other 
border crossing 
sites, 
development and 
integration 
of 
Customs applications, 
and installation 
of 
a 
reliable 
telecommunication 
service. 
The project 
will 
address 
the "petty"/small 
corruption 
at 
Customs 
sites 
through 
introduction 
of 
streamlined and 
more 
transparent 
procedures, 
and 
through 
constant 
monitoring 
of 
indicators 
measuring 
the actual 
performance 
of 
Customs and other 
border 
agencies' 
staff. 
These 
indicators 
will 
be 
made 
public 
locally, 
and 
shared 
regionally 
with 
the 
other 
TTFSE 
program 
countries 
via 
the 
Regional 
Steering 
Committee 
to 
which Moldova 
adhered. 
Reducing 
smuggling 
is 
a 
particular 
concern 
of 
MDC 
management, 
which 
is 
proposed 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project through 
enhancing 
the Customs 
preventive and 
enforcement 
capacity;  the 
enforcement 
unit 
will 
combine 
road 
patrols, 
the 
use 
of 
intelligence, 
monitoring 
of 
goods 
entered 
at 
the 
border and 
declared 
inland, and 
random 
roadside 
checks. 
The 
operations can 
be 
initially 
carried 
out 
in 
close 
coordination 
with 
other 
law 
enforcement 
agencies 
to 
avoid 
abusing 
the 
system. 
The 
integrated 
TTFSE 
program 
includes 
a 
number 
of 
mechanisms 
to 
achieve 
benefits 
that 
extend beyond 
-9- 
Page  14
savings 
achieved 
at 
the borders 
of 
one 
country. 
The regional 
dimension 
of 
the 
project 
stems 
from: 
(i) 
the 
signing 
of 
the 
regional 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding 
providing 
the 
needed 
high-level 
commitment; 
(ii) 
a 
Regional 
Steering Committee 
of 
high-level 
officials 
meeting 
twice 
a 
year 
focusing 
on 
border 
crossing 
issues; 
(iii) 
a 
regional 
website 
harmonizing 
the 
provision 
of 
information; 
(iv) 
pilot 
border 
crossings 
to

pragmatic 
improvements; 
and 
(v) 
regional 
training 
programs 
for 
the 
private 
sector 
to 
build 
up 
communities 
of 
professionals 
with 
shared 
knowledge.

Page  16
creation 
of 
databases 
accessible 
in 
real 
time 
at 
all 
main 
customs 
locations 
to 
support 
selectivity 
exchange 
of 
information 
with 
other government 
agencies 
for 
processing and 
enforcement 
support 
of 
international Electronic 
Data 
Interchange 
standards

opportunities 
by 
decreasing 
and 
monitoring 
human 
intervention. 
and 
targeting 
procedures; 
purposes; 
international 
trading 
community; 
c. 
Strengthening Regional 
and 
International 
Cooperation 
The project 
will 
lead 
to 
greater 
regional 
cohesion 
through 
several channels 
affecting 
both 
the 
administrations 
and 
the private 
sector. 
The Regional 
Steering 
Committee 
gathering 
all 
TTFSE 
countries 
and 
observers 
(Turkey, 
Greece, 
donors) 
will 
continue 
to 
facilitate 
cooperation and 
experience 
sharing. 
This 
forum 
is 
instrumental 
in 
comparing 
the 
standard 
TTFSE 
performance indicators 
across 
countries, 
review 
the 
difficulties 
in 
introducing 
approaches 
new 
to 
the 
region 
like 
selective processing, request 
the 
preparation 
of 
facilitation 
proposals 
and 
make 
policy 
decisions at 
a 
regional 
level. 
During 
the 
fifth 
RSC 
meeting, the 
Intemational 
Weighing 
Certificate 
was 
recognized 
for 
Customs purpose 
for 
example, 
removing 
the 
need 
for multiple 
weighing 
on 
a 
given 
itinerary. 
(the 
minutes 
of 
all 
the 
RSC 
meetings 
may 
be 
found  on 
the 
TTFSE 
website 
indicated 
below). 
The 
regional 
TTFSE 
website 
(http://WWW.seerecon.org/RegionalInitiatives/ttfe/ttfse-rsc. 
htm) 
presenting 
all 
requirements 
and 
procedures 
of 
border 
agencies has 
been 
offering, 
since 
the 
end 
of 
2002, 
advanced 
information 
tools 
for 
operators 
in 
the 
region 
and 
from 
abroad. 
The 
quarterly 
meetings 
of 
public-private 
worlung 
groups (PRO-Committees) 
have 
led 
to 
the creation 
of 
a 
number 
of 
worlung 
groups 
aimed 
at 
addressing 
specific 
facilitation 
issues. 
Regional 
conventional 
and 
distance 
learning 
programs 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Intemational Road 
Transport 
Union 
(IRU) 
and the 
Federation 
of 
International 
Forwarding 
Agents 
(FIATA) 
will 
enable 
harmonization 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
transport 
service 
providers. 
3. 
Benefits and 
target 
population: 
a. 
Benefits 
The 
customs 
reforms 
coupled 
with 
improved 
facilities and 
information 
technology 
will 
lead 
to 
transparent 
customs procedures, 
a 
more 
reliable 
business 
environment, 
and 
economic 
growth 
as 
a 
result 
of 
lower 
prices 
for 
imports 
and 
more 
competitive priceshervices 
for 
exports. 
The 
benefits 
will 
spill 
over 
to 
government 
agencies 
and 
private 
companies 
in 
other 
trade 
partner 
countries. 
This 
would 
translate 
into: 
cheaper 
import 
goods 
I 
inputs 
for 
consumers 
and 
industries; 
better 
and 
more 
reliable 
business 
environment 
for 
private 
sector 
activities, 
particularly 
for 
the 
a 
more predictable 
and 
reliable 
economic setting 
for 
foreign 
companies; 
time 
savings 
linked 
to 
improved 
conditions 
for 
transit 
traffic; 
reduction 
of 
corruption and 
smuggling 
opportunities; 
improved 
revenue 
collection 
by 
the 
MDC; 
uninterrupted 
services 
of 
information 
systems 
and 
better 
integrity 
of 
data; 
trade 
activities 
of 
small 
and 
medium 
enterprises; 
-12- 
Page  17
fewer 
errors, 
time 
savings a 
lower 
transaction 
costs 
resulting 
from 
a 
simplified 
interface 
to 
submit documents 
to 
government 
agencies. 
b. 
Target Population 
The 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
reform 
would 
be 
transport 
operators, 
importers, 
exporters, 
freight 
forwarders, 
other 
trade 
industries, 
foreign 
investors, 
and 
ultimately, 
consumers 
and 
producers 
inside 
and outside 
the 
region. 
Cross-border 
trade 
in 
the 
vicinity 
of 
the borders 
will 
be 
made 
easier 
for local 
companies. 
Travelers 
and 
tourism 
would 
also 
benefit. 
Improved 
facilities and 
procedures 
will 
shorten 
their 
waiting 
time 
and 
improve 
their 
travelling 
conditions. 
4. 
Institutional 
and

across 
border 
agencies 
to 
provide 
all 
information 
related 
to 
border crossing requirements 
to 
the 
trade 
facilitatiodwebsite 
coordinator. 
The 
Project 
Manager 
has 
been 
selected 
following 
advertising 
by 
MDC, 
and 
agreed 
upon 
with 
IDA. 
The 
project 
manager 
and 
her 
Project 
Implementation 
Team 
(PIT) 
is 
located 
in 
MDC. 
The 
team 
includes 
a 
procurement specialist and 
a 
financial 
management specialist, 
and 
has 
been 
fully 
established 
in 
October 
2002. 
The 
PIT 
manager 
plans 
to 
select a 
team 
assistant 
as 
needed. 
The 
PIT 
will 
cover 
procurement, 
loan 
management 
and reporting 
functions 
acceptable 
to 
IDA. 
The 
project 
manager 
will 
make an evaluation 
of 
the 
workload 
for 
the 
PIT 
and 
plan 
resources 
accordingly. 
The 
PIT 
will 
coordinate the 
project 
management 
for 
the various 
beneficiaries, prepare terms 
of 
reference, 
hire 
consultants, 
and 
contract 
for 
services, 
training,  and 
goods 
as 
necessary 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the project. 
The 
Trade 
Facilitation 
Coordinator 
has 
been 
nominated 
by 
the Chamber 
of 
Commerce. 
The 
Website 
Coordinator 
has 
been 
nominated 
by 
the 
International Association 
of 
Road Hauliers 
of 
Moldova 
(AITA). 
AITA 
is 
a 
recognized 
organization 
with 
a 
representative membership, 
working 
closely 
with 
MDC 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Transport and 
Communications 
to 
address 
impediments 
to 
international 
transport. 
Given 
the 
scope 
(eight 
countries) 
and 
complexity 
of 
the 
Regional Program and 
the 
related 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
anticipated, 
the 
Regional Steering Committee 
(RSC), 
meeting periodically 
at 
the 
regional 
level, 
is 
overseeing 
the 
overall implementation 
of 
the program. 
The 
participating 
countries have 
- 
13- 
Page  18
signed 
a 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding setting 
up 
the RSC. 
The RSC 
is 
made 
up 
of 
high-level 
officials 
of 
the 
participating 
countries (the 
Director 
General 
of MDC 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Moldova), 
and 
donor 
representatives 
as 
observers. 
It 
provides 
a 
forum 
for 
exchange 
of 
best 
practice 
in 
sector 
policy 
and 
reform 
decisions. 
Meetings 
rotate 
among 
the 
participating 
countries, 
with 
the 
project 
manager 
of 
the host 
country 
providing 
support services 
to 
the 
RSC. 
The Minutes 
of 
RSC 
meetings 
can 
be found 
at 
http 
:llwww. 
seerecon.orglRegionalInitiatives1ttfse.htm. 
In 
order 
to 
provide 
better understanding 
of 
border 
crossing problems, 
monitoring 
will 
take 
place 
at 
three 
pilot 
border 
crossings 
(Leuseni 
and Cahul 
with 
Romania, 
and 
Palanca 
with 
Ukraine) 
and 
one 
pilot 
inland terminal 
(Chisinau), 
as 
selected 
by 
MDC 
taking 
into 
consideration 
their 
importance 
and 
present 
and 
future 
traffic 
volumes. 
The 
neighboring country 
of 
Romania similarly 
treats 
as 
pilot 
stations 
facilities 
on 
its 
borders, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Program. 
A 
set 
of 
indicators 
for 
project 
monitoring 
has 
been 
defined and 
agreed 
upon 
(Annex 
1). 
These 
indicators 
are 
used 
by 
each 
country 
to 
examine 
and 
allow 
the 
evaluation 
of 
comparative performance. 
The Borrower 
will 
organize 
local 
project 
teams 
(LPT) 
made 
of 
representatives 
of 
various 
border 
agencies, 
who 
will 
jointly 
discuss the 
impediments 
resulting 
from 
the 
monitoring 
process, 
and 
propose remedies 
to 
the 
National 
Coordinator. 
The 
LPTs 
will 
be 
assisted 
by 
the 
SECI-TTFSE 
Advisory Team (STAT) 
as 
part 
of 
the 
US 
assistance 
to 
the 
improvement 
of 
pilot 
sites. 
This 
framework 
has 
been 
built 
as 
an 
assessment 
tool for 
identifying 
problems 
and traclung the 
success 
of 
the solutions 
applied 
in 
each 
case, 
providing 
an 
evolving 
case 
study. 
The 
results 
will 
be 
progressively 
updated 
each 
quarter 
by 
the 
PIT, 
and offered 
to 
the 
RSC 
for 
review 
and 
comparison 
during 
its 
meetings. 
The 
lessons 
learned 
from 
these 
case 
studies 
will 
be 
extended 
to 
other specific 
border 
crossings 
in 
the 
participating 
countries and 
to 
change 
management 
in 
general. 
Sharing the 
case 
studies, 
along 
with 
other 
project 
reports, 
with 
the 
customs 
services 
and 
transport associations 
in 
countries 
not 
associated 
with 
the 
TTFSE 
will 
set 
quality 
targets 
in 
customs 
reforms beyond 
the 
region. 
As 
an 
example, 
after 
one year 
of 
implementation, 
waiting 
time 
at 
the 
best 
performing 
clearance site 
in 
the 
TTFSE 
program 
dropped 
by 
50 
percent. 
c. 
Procurement 
Goods 
and 
services 
financed 
by 
IDA 
will 
be 
procured 
in 
accordance 
with 
IDA 
procurement guidelines. 
The 
PIT 
includes 
a 
procurement 
specialist selected 
during 
the 
Bank's 
post-appraisal 
mission 
of 
September 2002, 
and 
hired 
in 
October 
2002. 
The 
procurement 
specialist 
received 
partial 
training,  and 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
outside 
IDA 
procurement 
advisors 
as 
required. The 
advisors 
will 
be individuals 
with 
satisfactory 
country and 
IDA 
procurement 
experience, 
to be 
funded 
by 
the 
credit 
proceeds. 
The 
project 
components 
not 
financed 
by 
IDA 
will 
be 
procured 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
country's regulations 
or 
the procurement regulations 
of 
the 
co-financing 
governmentlinstitution. 
IDA 
will 
finance, 
on 
a 
single 
source basis, 
the 
implementation 
of 
ASYCUDA 
clearance system 
by 
UNCTAD 
(details 
in 
Annex 
6). 
The project 
elements, 
their 
estimated 
cost 
and procurement methods 
are 
summarized 
in 
Table 
A 
of 
Annex 
6. 
A

The 
PIT 
was established 
by 
Government 
Decision 
No. 
433 
on 
April 
10, 
2002 
as 
a 
legal 
entity 
with 
its 
own 
statute, 
created 
specifically 
to 
implement 
the 
TTFSE 
IDA-financed 
project.  The 
PIT 
reports 
to 
the 
-

Page  19
MDC 
and 
the 
MOF. 
Project 
funds 
will 
flow 
from: 
(i) 
IDA, 
either 
via 
a 
single Special 
Account 
which 
will 
be 
replenished 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
SOEs, 
or 
by 
direct 
payment 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
direct 
payment 
withdrawal 
applications; 
and 
(ii) 
the 
Government, 
via 
the 
Treasury 
at 
the 
MOF 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
payment 
requests 
prepared 
by 
the 
PIT. 
The Credit 
Agreement 
will 
be 
signed between 
IDA 
and the 
Government 
of 
Moldova.  The 
Government 
will 
authorize 
the 
PIT 
to 
use 
the 
credit 
proceeds. 
There 
will 
be 
a 
single 
SA 
for 
the 
whole 
project 
implementation. 
The 
PIT 
will 
execute 
the 
payments 
from 
the Government 
contribution directly 
from 
the 
Government 
contribution 
account opened at 
the 
Treasury 
within 
MOF. 
e. 
Reporting 
The 
PIT 
will 
prepare 
quarterly 
progress 
reports 
and 
submit 
them 
to 
IDA. 
These 
reports 
will 
include: 
the 
progress 
of 
each 
project 
component, 
key 
performance 
indicators, 
and 
procurement 
status 
(actions dealt 
with, 
actions planned, 
and an 
update 
of 
the procurement implementation). 
The 
report 
will 
include 
performance 
measurements 
against 
the 
implementation 
schedule, 
and 
compliance 
with 
credit 
covenants. 
Overall, 
project 
monitoring 
will 
be 
based 
on 
performance 
targets 
and 
indicators 
listed 
in 
Annex 
1. 
j 
Supervision 
and Evaluation 
Arrangements 
Each 
year 
between 
January 
and 
February 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project, 
IDA 
together 
with 
the 
PIT 
and 
donors 
(US 
Government) 
will 
conduct 
a 
review 
of 
project 
execution 
for 
the 
previous 
year. 
The 
review 
will 
assess 
the 
status 
of 
regional and national implementation and 
cooperation, 
progress 
made 
at 
the 
level 
of 
pilot 
sites 
compared 
to 
targets, 
development 
of 
the 
information 
system, 
implementation 
of 
donor 
programs, 
and 
productivity 
of 
the 
MDC. 
The 
review 
will 
offer refined 
targets 
and objectives 
for 
the 
up-coming 
year 
and 
a 
set 
of 
recommendations. 
The 
schedule 
of 
procurement 
for 
the 
coming 
year 
will 
be 
agreed 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
review, considering 
the 
progress 
to 
date 
in 
the 
institutional 
reform. 
D. 
Project 
Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
The 
Moldova 
project conforms 
to 
the 
TTFSE 
existing regional 
program. 
Several 
altematives were 
considered 
prior 
to 
deciding to 
move 
forward 
with 
a 
regional 
program 
of 
investment 
projects. There 
have 
been 
no 
alternatives 
for 
the 
Moldova 
- 
TTFSE 
project.

The 
main 
lesson learned 
from 
ongoing 
World 
Bank 
projects 
is 
the importance 
of 
keeping 
project 
objectives 
and 
scope 
simple 
so 
as 
not to 
exceed 
the 
limited 
absorptive capacity 
of 
the 
ministries 
and the 
local staff 
of 
other 
organizations. 
Recent experience 
under the 
on-going 
TTFSE 
program 
indicates the need 
for 
the country 
to 
take 
full 
ownership 
over 
the 
modemization 
process, 
with 
external support 
in 
the 
areas 
where 
local 
expertise 
is 
not 
yet available. 
It 
also 
indicates 
that, 
given 
the 
multiplicity 
of 
parties 
involved 
in 
trade 
and transport 
facilitation, coordination and 
cooperation 
with 
the 
business 
community 
represented 
by 
associations 
of 
roads hauliershransporters, chambers 
of 
commerce 
and 
PRO-committees 
provide 
a 
stronger 
dynamic 
to 
the 
process. 
The 
EU-PHARE 
and 
USAID 
experiences 
show 
that 
in 
order 
to 
lessen 
transaction 
costs 
at 
border 
crossings, 
border 
crossings investments 
need 
to be 
supplemented 
by: 
(i) 
reliable 
traffic 
data; 
(ii) 
accurate 
information 
on 
waiting 
times; 
(iii) 
adequate 
remedial 
actions 
on 
both 
sides 
of 
a 
border 
crossing; 
(iv) 
attention 
to 
multi-agency 
needs; 
(v) 
linkage 
to 
national 
transport policies; 
(vi) 
reliable 
communications 
infrastructure 
and 
equipment; 
(vii) 
communication 
with 
users; 
and 
(viii) 
coordination and 
simplification 
of 
customs procedures and 
removal 
of 
state 
controls 
on 
international 
trade. 
These lessons 
are 
reflected 
in 
the design 
of 
the present 
project. 
It 
was 
tailored 
to 
respond 
to 
stakeholders' 
- 
16- 
Page  21
concerns 
following 
active 
consultations. 
The 
project 
beneficiaries 
will 
cooperate 
with 
other 
agencies 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
integrated solutions 
at 
national 
level 
and 
local level (pilot 
border 
crossings). 
The 
pilots 
will 
stimulate cooperation 
across 
borders and among 
agencies 
to 
optimize 
procedures, 
communication 
links 
and 
monitoring 
of 
performance. 
Customs 
users 
will 
receive 
training 
to 
enhance 
their professional 
skills 
and 
will 
get 
access 
to 
distance 
learning training 
with 
certification 
created 
under 
the 
program. 
They 
will 
be 
encouraged 
to 
voice their 
concerns 
and 
priorities through 
the 
regional 
TTFSE 
website, 
and 
will 
receive 
accurate 
and 
timely 
information 
on 
existing 
procedures. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and ownership: 
In 
2001 
the 
country 
entered 
the 
World 
Trade 
Organization 
(WTO), 
and 
joined 
the 
Stability 
Pact 
for 
South-Eastern Europe. 
WTO 
membership 
is 
a 
significant 
achievement 
for 
Moldova, 
with 
its 
highly 
trade-dependent 
economy and 
difficulty 
in 
attracting the 
necessary 
levels 
of 
foreign 
investment; 
membership 
in 
the 
trade 
body 
will 
serve 
as 
an important 
signal 
for 
potential 
investors. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
Stability 
Pact 
includes 
a trade 
accord 
with 
the 
EU, 
envisaging 
the 
liberalization 
of 
90 
percent 
of 
Balkan 
countries' 
trade 
with 
the 
EU 
market 
over 
the 
next 
years; 
membership 
in 
the Pact 
will 
open 
better 
access 
to 
regional 
markets. 
The 
Moldovan 
Government 
requested 
the 
World 
Bank 
support 
for 
the 
modernization 
of 
its 
Customs 
services 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
became aware 
of 
the 
regional 
program 
for 
trade 
facilitation 
that was 
being 
prepared 
in 
its 
neighborhood. 
The 
Government 
attaches great 
importance 
to 
facilitating 
trade 
and 
transport, 
to 
regional 
cooperation and 
simplification 
of 
procedures, 
and 
to 
fighting 
smuggling 
and 
corruption 
at 
borders. 
The 
proposed project's objectives 
are 
fully 
in 
line 
with 
the 
Government's 
National 
Program 
that 
lists 
them 
as 
priorities, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
the 
MDC 
Development 
Action 
Plan. 
Moldova joined 
the 
RSC 
as 
an 
observer 
as 
early 
as 
March 
2001, 
and participated actively 
in 
all 
its 
subsequent 
meetings. 
The 
Government 
signed 
the 
MOU 
for 
full 
membership 
in 
the 
RSC 
in 
September, 
2001. 
The 
country 
organized 
and 
hosted the 
latest 
RSC 
meeting 
of 
the 
TTFSE 
program 
countries 
in 
February, 2003. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
Adherence 
of 
Moldova 
(and 
the 
FR 
of 
Yugoslavia 
at 
the 
same 
time) 
to 
the 
TTFSE 
program 
fulfills 
the 
regional dimension 
of 
the 
TTFSE 
program. 
With 
a 
complete 
country 
coverage 
of 
Southeast 
Europe 
fruitful 
exchanges 
can 
take 
place 
on 
Customs 
reform, regional 
cooperation 
and simplification, 
and 
compatibility 
of 
information 
systems. 
Performance 
measurements 
at 
pilots 
using 
the 
TTFSE 
methodology 
enable comparisons 
across 
countries. 
The 
partnership 
between the 
TTFSE 
program 
and 
the 
representatives 
of 
business 
community 
(chambers 
of 
commerce, PRO-committees, transporters) 
ensures 
a 
permanent 
link 
between 
public 
and private 
parties, 
with 
rapid 
feed-back 
on 
the 
needs 
of 
the private 
sector. 
Furthermore, 
the 
BankADA 
through 
its 
broader 
lending 
and 
country 
assistance 
strategies 
is 
well 
placed 
to 
help 
promote 
cooperation, 
and coordination 
of 
policies.

The 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
have 
a 
rate 
of 
return 
of 
29 
percent. 
The 
project 
would 
have 
an 
impact 
spreading 
over the 
whole 
country 
since 
the 
main 
investments 
include 
procedure 
improvements and 
the 
rollout 
of 
a 
new 
information 
systems. 
Two 
benefits 
have 
been 
quantified: 
(i) 
lower 
transport 
costs due 
to 
the 
reduction 
of 
waiting 
times 
at 
border 
crossings 
and 
inland 
terminals; 
and 
(ii) 
economic benefits 
of

Page  22
trade 
expansion 
resulting 
from 
the project. 
The 
following 
additional 
benefits 
will 
be 
monitored over 
the 
project 
life, 
but 
were 
not 
quantified 
for 
the purpose 
of 
this 
evaluation: 
(i) 
increased 
quality 
of 
services 
provided 
by 
the border 
agencies 
to 
the 
private 
sector; 
(ii) 
increased 
market 
share 
of 
local 
transport 
service 
providers through 
better 
education; 
and 
(iii) 
increased revenue 
collections (although 
not 
per 
se 
an 
economic benefit). 
The 
time 
savings 
are 
based 
on 
meeting 
the performance 
targets agreed 
upon 
(Annex 
1) 
compared 
to 
the 
foreseen 
performance 
without 
the project. 
The 
analysis 
indicates 
that 
the economic 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
would 
depend 
on 
meeting 
these 
targets 
on 
time, 
with 
a 
relative 
high 
sensitivity to 
delays 
in 
implementation 
or 
in 
traffic 
volumes. 
Even 
without taking 
into 
account 
unquantified 
benefits, 
there 
is 
a 
good 
likelihood 
of 
positive 
economic 
results. 
The reduction 
in 
costs 
to 
trade 
and 
the 
increased 
reliability 
of 
delivery 
times 
are 
expected 
to 
lead, 
in 
the 
medium 
run, 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
trade volumes. 
2. 
Financial 
(see 
Annex

and 
Annex 
5): 
NPV=US$

FRR

(see 
Annex 
4) 
Fiscal 
Impact: 
The 
fiscal impact 
of 
the 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
positive. 
The 
real volume 
of 
trade 
is 
probably higher 
than shown 
by 
official 
records, 
considering under-reporting 
and 
under-valuation. 
Improvement 
in 
overall 
performance, enhanced 
integrity, 
more 
selective approach 
to 
controls and 
stronger enforcement 
capacity 
will 
enable 
Customs 
to 
both 
expand the 
official 
volume 
of 
trade 
and 
avoid 
frequent 
mis-classifications, 
under-reporting 
and 
undervaluation, thereby 
generating 
additional 
customs 
duties and 
taxes. 
The 
experience 
with 
other 
TTFSE 
projects 
shows 
that the 
higher the 
percentage 
of 
cargo 
physical 
examination 
-typical 
in 
all 
non-reformed SEE 
Customs 
-the 
lower 
the 
rate 
detection 
of 
fraudirregularities. 
The introduction 
of 
risk 
based 
selective 
examination 
by 
Customs 
as 
a 
key 
procedural 
reform 
under the 
project 
will 
result 
in 
an 
increased 
rate 
of 
detection. 
The 
Government counterpart 
contribution 
would 
be 
limited 
to 
applicable 
taxes 
and 
duties, 
except 
for 
the 
operating 
cost 
of 
the transit 
vehicle tracking 
system. 
3. 
Technical: 
The 
project 
does 
not 
propose 
to 
finance 
expansion 
of 
border 
crossing 
points 
facilities. 
Minor 
improvements 
at 
existing 
selected 
border 
points 
will 
include 
reorganization 
of 
traffic 
flows 
and 
work 
stations, 
and 
will 
be 
limited 
to 
upgrading 
or 
setting 
up 
secondary 
inspection facilities 
(inspection 
bays, 
sheds), 
executing 
small repair 
works, 
and 
installing 
of 
signaling 
and 
marking 
equipment, 
booths 
and 
canopies. 
The 
creation 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
Customs 
information 
system 
requires 
highly 
skilled 
professionals, 
with 
strong 
and clear leadership. 
The 
MDC 
will 
receive appropriate technical 
support 
throughout the 
project 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
right 
elements 
of 
project 
management 
and 
quality 
control 
are 
in 
place. 
Special efforts 
will 
be 
paid 
by 
supervision missions 
to 
follow 
closely implementation 
progress 
of 
the 
information 
system. 
4. 
Institutional: 
Implementation 
will 
be 
overseen 
by 
the Project Manager and her Project Implementation 
Team 
(PIT). 
The 
National 
Coordinator 
will 
assist 
the 
PIT 
in 
obtaining 
inputs 
from 
the 
other 
agencies 
involved. 
The 
recruitment 
of 
the 
project 
manager 
and the 
rest 
of 
PIT 
staff 
has 
been completed. 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
The 
MDC 
will 
be 
the executing 
agency.

4.2 
Project 
management: 
The 
Project Manager 
and 
her 
team located 
in 
MDC 
will 
bear 
the 
responsibility 
for 
project 
implementation. 
The 
overall project 
management, 
including 
the cooperation 
at 
high 
level 
with 
other 
border 
agencies 
and 
the 
business 
community 
will 
be 
overseen 
by 
the 
National 
Coordinator, 
to 
whom 
the 
PIT 
reports. 
The 
RSC, 
meeting 
at least 
twice 
a 
year, 
will 
oversee 
the 
coordination 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
TTFSE 
Program. 
The 
RSC 
is 
constituted 
of 
high 
level officials 
(the 
National 
Coordinators) 
of 
the 
participating 
countries empowered 
to implement 
necessary sector 
policy 
and 
reform 
decisions. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
A 
procurement capacity 
assessment 
was 
carried out 
by 
IDA 
in 
November, 
2001, 
and 
updated 
by 
the 
IDA 
appraisal 
team 
in 
June, 
2002. 
Goods 
and 
services 
financed 
by 
IDA 
will 
be 
procured 
in 
accordance 
with 
IDA 
procurement 
guidelines. 
IDA 
will 
finance the 
implementation 
of 
ASYCUDA 
Customs 
clearance 
based 
on 
a 
direct 
contract 
to 
be 
negotiated 
directly 
between the 
Borrower 
and 
UNCTAD. 
The 
contract 
will 
be 
signed 
by 
credit 
effectiveness. 
The 
project 
components 
not 
financed 
by 
IDA 
will 
be 
procured 
in 
accordance 
with 
the procurement regulations 
of 
the 
co-financing institutions. 
The 
PIT 
procurement 
advisors 
will 
be 
individuals 
with 
satisfactory 
IDA 
procurement 
experience 
to 
be 
funded 
by 
the credit. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
The 
financial 
management 
arrangements 
of 
the 
project 
meet 
the 
minimum 
financial 
management 
requirements 
of 
the 
IDA. 
As 
of 
the 
date 
of 
this 
report, 
the 
Borrower 
is 
in 
compliance 
with 
its 
audit 
covenants 
of 
existing 
IDA-financed 
projects. 
The 
annual audited 
project financial 
statements 
will 
be provided 
to 
IDA 
within 
six 
months 
from 
the 
end 
of 
each 
fiscal 
year, 
and 
also 
at 
the 
closing 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
current 
Country 
Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
for Moldova 
dated 
September  26, 
1995 
was 
prepared 
at 
a 
time 
of 
considerable 
transition and 
therefore, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
time 
that 
has since 
elapsed, 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
out-of-date. 
A 
revised 
CFAA 
is 
under 
preparation. 
The 
Interim 
PRSP 
of 
November 15,2000 confirms 
that 
improvement 
is 
required 
in 
the management 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
including 
the 
budget 
process 
and budget 
execution, 
as 
well 
as 
cash 
and 
debt 
management. 
Thus 
PIT 
has 
developed 
policies and 
procedures 
that 
operate 
in 
addition 
to 
those 
of 
the 
current 
public 
expenditure 
management 
framework 
to 
minimize 
project financial 
management 
risks. 
The 
Bank 
conducted 
a 
Country 
Portfolio 
Financial 
Management 
Review 
(CPFMR) 
of 
all 
projects under 
implementation 
in 
Moldova 
and 
identified 
some 
common financial 
management 
issues; 
the 
Bank 
confirmed 
that 
all 
such 
issues 
have been 
appropriately 
addressed 
in 
the 
design 
of 
project’s 
financial 
management 
arrangements. 
The banking 
sector 
in 
Moldova 
is 
relatively 
weak. 
However, 
the 
PIT 
has 
been 
operating satisfactorily 
its 
project 
preparation 
facility 
(PPF) 
Special 
Account 
in 
a 
commercial 
bank 
acceptable 
to 
the Bank, 
whose 
financial 
status 
and 
statements are 
reviewed 
on 
an 
ongoing 
basis 
by 
the 
Bank. 
As 
these 
arrangements 
have 
been satisfactory, 
they 
will 
remain 
in 
place 
during 
the 
TTFSE 
project 
implementation. 
5. 
Environmental: 
5.1  Summarize 
the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation 
and

and the significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
The 
project 
details have been discussed 
with 
the 
Regional 
Safeguard 
review 
team, 
and 
it 
was 
determined 
that 
there 
are 
no 
significant 
environmentalhafeguard 
issues 
in 
the 
project.

6. 
Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, 
and 
specify 
the 
project's social 
development 
outcomes. 
Companies 
in 
Moldova 
and 
in 
particular 
traders 
are 
seriously 
impacted 
by 
border 
and 
inland 
processing 
delays, 
usually 
caused 
by 
improper knowledge 
of 
current border 
requirements. 
Regularly 
changing 
procedures 
affect 
all 
companies, 
but 
in 
particular 
SMEs 
with 
limited 
resources 
to 
follow 
up 
on 
changes. 
Large 
companies 
usually 
dedicate a 
team 
to monitor 
changes 
in 
procedures. 
The regional 
TTFSE 
website 
will 
allow 
access 
to 
all 
the procedures 
and 
requirements 
of 
border 
agencies 
regarding 
trade 
and 
international 
transport, 
improving 
transparency 
to 
a 
large 
extent, 
thereby 
reducing 
opportunities 
for 
illegal 
payments. 
The 
access 
to 
the 
site 
will 
be 
promoted 
by 
AITA 
( 
representative 
of 
road 
transport 
operators). 
The provision 
under the 
project 
of 
both 
conventional 
and 
paper-based 
distance 
learning 
training 
to 
service 
providers 
will 
also 
improve 
access 
to 
knowledge related 
to 
trade, 
transport 
and 
logistics. 
The 
partnership 
with 
the 
local 
professional 
association 
will 
increase 
the 
availability 
of 
training 
materials. 
The 
electronic 
forum 
under 
the website 
will 
empower the 
business 
community 
in 
the 
region 
and 
outside 
by 
enabling 
it 
to voice 
its 
opinion 
on 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
border 
services 
received and 
to 
propose corresponding 
recommendations 
to 
facilitate 
trade 
and 
transport 
activities. 
Date 
of 
receipt 
of 
final 
draft: 
The 
project 
will 
have 
an 
indirect 
impact 
on 
the 
poor 
by 
reducing corruption 
and 
waiting 
time 
at 
border 
crossing points. 
Faster 
and 
smoother 
border crossing 
both 
for 
trucks 
and 
passenger 
transport 
will 
remove 
some 
of 
the 
constraints 
affecting 
people 
commuting 
frequently through 
the 
border 
or 
visiting 
their 
family 
in 
neighboring 
countries. 
It 
will 
proportionally 
have 
a 
larger 
impact 
on 
short distance 
trips. 
It 
will 
also 
reduce the routine, yet 
often 
unsolicited, payments that 
currently 
take place 
at 
border 
crossing 
points. 
Like 
for 
other 
TTFSE 
projects, 
interactions 
with 
other organizations 
dealing 
with 
smuggling 
and 
trafficking 
(in 
particular human trafficking) 
problems, 
like 
the 
SECI 
Anti-Crime 
Center 
in 
Bucharest, 
will 
be 
maintained. 
The 
reduction 
in 
border 
crossing 
delays 
will 
reduce 
trade 
and 
transport 
costs 
and, 
in 
turn, 
the 
cost 
of 
imported 
goods, 
leading 
to 
benefits 
to 
consumers 
and 
lower 
cost 
of 
inputs required 
for 
local 
manufacturing, 
with 
corresponding creation 
of 
new 
jobs. 
The 
import 
effect, 
however, 
will 
be 
partly 
offset 
by 
losses 
incurred 
by 
local 
producers 
when 
new 
imports 
replace 
local 
products. 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
The program 
design reflects 
views 
expressed 
by 
principal 
stakeholders 
including 
such 
Customs 
users 
as 
truckers 
and freight 
forwarders. 
Bank 
staff 
have 
conducted 
interviews 
to 
identify 
trade 
impediments and 
their 
remedial 
actions 
during 
the 
preparation 
of 
the project. 
A 
detailed 
users 
survey 
of 
traders, 
transport 
-20- 
Page  25
and 
forwarding 
companies, 
using 
the 
methodology 
developed 
under 
the 
TTFSE 
program 
is 
under 
way. 
This 
analysis 
includes 
in 
particular 
a 
detailed 
review 
of 
the 
issues 
related 
to 
clearance 
of 
goods and 
border 
crossing. 
In 
addition, 
activities planned 
under 
the 
Trade 
Facilitation 
Development 
component 
will 
foster 
opportunities 
for 
closer, 
more 
frequent 
and 
transparent 
contact and 
feedback 
between 
Customs 
and 
the trading 
community 
through 
AITA 
and the Chamber 
of 
Commerce. 
Principal 
stakeholders, 
for 
example truckers 
and 
forwarders, 
are 
members 
of 
AITA 
and 
will 
therefore 
be 
actively involved 
in 
monitoring 
border 
delays 
and 
corruption.

How 
does 
the 
project 
involve

How 
will 
the

performance 
indicators 
on 
reduction 
of

that 
are 
critical 
to 
fulfilling 
Moldova's long-term 
objective 
of 
achieving 
sustainable 
growth.  Once the 
MDC 
is 
modernized 
the 
transparency 
in 
customs 
operations, 
regular 
cooperation among border 
agencies 
including 
those 
of 
other countries, 
and 
the 
gains 
captured 
by 
all 
parties 
involved 
in 
legitimate trade 
will 
become 
the 
main 
driver 
of 
sustainability. 
Continuous 
upgrading 
of 
the customs 
services, 
procedures, 
management, 
and equipment 
based 
on 
a 
suitable 
budget 
will 
enable 
the 
MDC 
to 
cope 
with 
trade 
and 
traffic 
growth, 
technological 
advance, 
and 
eventual 
compatibility 
with 
the 
EU. 
Systematic 
peer comparison 
using 
similar indicators 
will 
also 
create 
some 
stimulus 
for 
sustainable 
improvements.

Mitigation Measure 
The 
high 
level National 
Coordinator 
will 
have 
the 
power 
to 
request 
meetings 
of 
the various 
border 
agencies; 
MDC 
coordinates 
activities 
at 
the border. 
The 
approach 
will 
be 
consolidated, 
providing 
an 
effective 
counterbalance 
to 
pressure groups. 
Risk 
From 
Outputs

Objective 
Cooperation 
among border 
agencies 
faces 
inertia and 
strong 
resistance. 
Political 
commitment

not 
adequate 
to 
resist 
pressure 
groups (public and 
private) 
and 
to 
ensure 
the 
success 
of 
the 
institutional 
program. 
Donor 
funding 
fails 
to 
materialize, 
or to 
cover 
the 
whole project 
implementation 
due 
to 
the annual budget approval 
process 
in 
US. 
Regional 
cooperation 
issues 
prevent 
the 
achievement 
of 
regional 
goals. 
Customs 
corruption 
is 
not 
kept 
under 
control. 
S 
The 
US 
Government 
will 
provide 
a 
commitment letter covering the 
project

for 
the

The 
MOU, 
the RSC, the

the

will 
create a 
favorable

3. 
Possible 
Controversial 
Aspects: 
The 
facilitation 
of 
trade 
and 
fight 
against 
corruption 
require 
substantial 
efforts 
by 
several 
players. 
The 
International Convention 
on 
the 
Harmonization 
of 
the 
Frontier Controls 
of 
Goods 
(Geneva 
1982) 
( 
Http://mv.unece.org/trans/conventii/harmone.pdQ 
calls 
for 
a 
coordinating 
role 
by 
the Customs 
to 
ensure 
the 
efficient 
processing 
of 
vehicles. 
In 
Moldova, 
the 
position 
of 
MDC 
as 
leading 
agency at 
the 
border 
has 
been 
lately 
eroded due 
to 
the 
inefficiencies 
in 
fighting 
smuggling 
- 
particularly 
related 
to 
Transnistria 
- 
and the increasingly 
poor 
reputation 
of 
Customs 
staff 
in 
terms 
of 
integrity. 
The 
strategy 
towards 
strengthening 
the 
preventive and 
enforcement 
capacity 
of 
Customs 
will 
help 
re-establishing the 
role 
of 
MDC. 
It 
is 
expected that the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
smuggling 
through 
Transnistria 
be only 
indirect, through 
the proposed 
implementation 
of 
a 
transit and 
inland 
control 
system 
that 
would 
allow 
the 
monitoring 
of 
goods 
entered at 
the 
border 
and declared 
inland 
through 
various 
methods. 
However, 
the 
opportunities 
for 
illegal 
transshipments, 
diversions, 
or 
leakages 
on 
the 
domestic 
market 
will 
remain 
as 
long 
as 
Moldova 
will 
have 
no 
controliauthority over 
the Transnistrian region. 
Moreover, 
Moldova's 
singular 
efforts 
will 
have 
no 
major 
impact 
as 
long 
as 
progress 
in 
discussions 
with 
Russia and 
Ukraine 
on 
the 
change 
in 
the 
status 
of 
the 
region 
remains blocked, 
and 
there 
are 
strong economic 
interests 
in 
both 
countries 
on 
the 
side 
of 
current Transnistrian authorities.

The 
proposed 
modernization 
of 
the 
MDC 
and 
related 
computerization 
will 
impact 
both 
border crossing 
processing 
and clearance at 
terminals 
on 
the 
full 
territory controlled 
by 
the 
MDC. 
As 
such 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
most 
vehicles 
legitimately entering 
or 
exiting 
this 
territory 
will 
be 
positively 
impacted 
by 
the 
project. 
While 
the 
costs are 
relatively straightforwardly identified, 
the 
marginal 
benefits 
linked 
to 
the 
project 
are 
subject 
to 
a 
significant 
margin 
of 
uncertainty, especially 
as 
regards 
the 
causal 
link 
between technical 
assistance 
inputs 
and their impact 
on 
behavior. 
The 
economic 
cost-benefit 
analysis 
compares 
the economic 
costs 
and 
benefits 
of 
the 
project over 
the 
implementation 
period 
and 
over an 
assumed 5-year 
economic 
life 
of 
project 
components. 
Detailed 
calculations 
on 
costs 
and benefits 
are 
shown 
in

All 
costs 
and 
benefits 
are 
expressed 
in

All 
investment 
costs are 
net 
of 
import 
duties and 
of 
either 
taxes

Summary 
of 
Benefits 
and 
Costs: 
costs 
The 
project 
cost 
considered 
for 
the economic 
evaluation 
amounts 
to 
US$8.0 
million 
excluding 
taxes 
and 
price 
contingencies 
and 
including 
physical 
contingencies. 
It 
includes 
the 
following 
components: 
(i) 
technical 
assistance 
to 
the 
MDC 
to 
streamline procedures 
and 
develop 
a 
pilot 
site 
approach 
at 
major 
border 
crossing 
points 
and 
clearance 
facilities; 
(ii) 
introduction 
of 
a 
new 
Customs 
information 
system 
and 
strengthening 
of 
the 
MDC 
computer network; 
(iii) 
targeted 
infrastructure 
support at 
border 
crossing

facilities; 
(iii) 
trade 
facilitation 
development 
measures; 
and 
(iv) 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
program 
and 
project 
implementation. 
Benefits 
Two 
benefits 
have been 
quantified: 
(i) 
lower 
transport 
costs due 
to 
the 
diminution 
of 
waiting 
times 
at 
border 
crossings 
and 
clearance terminals; and 
(ii) 
economic 
benefits 
of 
trade 
expansion 
resulting 
from 
the project. 
The 
following 
additional 
benefits 
will 
be monitored 
over 
the 
project 
life, 
but 
were 
not 
quantified 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
this 
evaluation 
: 
(i) 
increased 
quality 
of 
services 
provided 
by 
border 
agencies 
to 
the 
private 
sector; 
(ii) 
increased 
market 
share 
of 
local 
transport 
service 
providers through 
better 
education; 
and 
(iii) 
increased revenue 
collections (although 
only 
a 
transfer 
payment 
to 
the 
Government, 
not 
a 
net benefit to 
the 
FRY 
economy 
per 
se). 
Trade 
and 
Transport 
Costs 
Reduction. 
The 
annual 
savings 
on 
transport 
costs 
at border 
crossings 
and 
inland 
terminals 
under 
the 
project 
would 
progressively reach about 
US$2.0 
million 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2007, 
compared 
to 
small 
progress expected 
without 
the 
project. 
Six 
locations, 
selected 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
current 
and 
foreseen 
traffic 
flows 
would 
bring 
the 
most 
benefits 
through 
both 
layout improvements 
and 
streamlining 
of 
procedures. 
These 
locations 
would 
include 
pilot 
border crossing 
points 
(Leuseni, 
Palanka 
and 
Cahul), 
a 
pilot 
clearance 
terminal 
(Chisinau) 
and 
two 
locations 
with 
layout 
improvement 
(Ocnita and 
Briceni). 
Other 
locations 
would 
also 
benefit through 
the 
broad 
computerization and 
networlung, 
but 
this 
aspect 
was 
not 
quantified. 
Current 
delays 
at 
border 
crossings 
and 
inland 
terminals 
are 
symptomatic 
of 
a 
number 
of 
issues 
associated 
with 
deficiencies 
in 
trade 
related 
services: 
procedural 
complexity, 
lack 
of 
inter-agency cooperation, cumbersome 
documentation 
requirements, systematic 
checks, 
slow 
customs clearance 
steps, 
absence 
of 
standard service 
times 
and 
inadequate 
infrastructure. 
Wider 
Economic 
Impact 
of 
Increased 
Trade. 
In 
practice, 
the 
likely 
impacts 
on 
trade 
under the project 
comes 
from: 
(i) 
economies 
of 
scales 
in 
downstream 
markets; 
and 
(ii) 
increased 
reliability 
in 
the delivery 
of 
goods. 
Both 
will 
facilitate industrial and logistic 
service 
restructuring and facilitate 
the 
integration 
of 
local 
companies 
into 
international 
production 
chains. 
In 
the 
medium 
run 
(from 
2004) 
these 
two 
elements 
would 
enable 
an increase 
in 
trade 
volumes. 
Such 
trade gains 
are 
obtained 
by 
combining 
trade 
creation 
and trade-substitution 
effects. 
The 
trade 
creation 
effect 
is 
the 
increased 
demand 
in 
the 
importing 
country 
for 
a 
commodity 
from 
an exporting 
country, 
resulting 
from 
the 
price 
decrease 
associated 
with 
the 
elimination 
or 
reduction 
of 
distortions. Trade substitution 
accounts 
for 
the 
tendency 
of 
importers 
to 
substitute 
goods 
from 
one source 
to 
another 
in 
response 
to 
a change 
in 
the 
import price 
of 
supplies 
from 
one 
source. 
Imports 
would 
be 
the 
most 
affected 
initially, 
since 
the border 
inefficiencies 
bear 
mostly 
on 
imports. 
However 
the 
regional 
nature 
of 
the 
project 
would 
simultaneously 
impact 
exports. 
Increased 
import 
volumes 
would 
benefit 
local 
consumers 
(inclusive 
of 
local 
companies 
relying 
on 
foreign 
inputs 
for 
their 
production) 
by 
increasing 
their 
consumer 
surplus 
and 
would 
create a 
loss 
for 
some 
local 
manufacturers, whose 
products become replaced 
by 
new 
imports. Increased 
export 
volume 
would 
benefit 
local 
producers 
by 
opening 
new 
market opportunities and 
would 
reduce 
local 
consumer 
surplus 
by 
reducing 
the 
quantity 
available 
on 
the 
local 
market 
at 
the 
initial 
price. 
The broad 
economic 
impact 
of 
cheaper 
and 
better 
trade 
services 
on 
existing market failure 
is 
complex 
to 
analyze even 
in 
countries 
with 
valid 
statistical 
data 
and 
requires 
general 
equilibrium 
models 
taking 
into 
account the 
monetary/foreign 
exchange 
impacts 
of 
new 
trade patterns. 
Given 
the 
current 
level 
and 
quality 
of 
data 
available 
on 
Moldova, 
such 
a 
detailed 
evaluation 
would 
not 
be 
realistic. 
Various 
studies, 
notably 
" 
The 
welfare 
implications 
of 
transport 
improvements 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
market 
failure", 
Anthony 
Venables, 
London 
School 
of 
Economics and 
Michael 
Gasiorek, 
School 
of 
European 
Studies, 
describe 
this 
phenomenon 
and show additional 
benefits 
ranging between 
20 
and 
30 
percent 
over the 
transport 
-

Page  44
savings 
generated. 
For 
the purpose 
of 
this 
evaluation, 
20 
percent was considered 
as 
the 
most 
appropriate. 
Variation 
within 
a 
likely 
range 
would 
not 
lead 
to 
a different 
conclusion 
on 
the 
viability 
of 
the 
project.

The 
project 
would 
significantly 
accelerate 
the 
MDC 
modernization 
and 
as 
a 
result 
lead 
to 
substantial 
time 
savings expected 
from 
the 
modernization. 
The 
waiting time 
reduction 
with 
the 
project 
compared 
to 
the 
current performance 
is 
based 
on 
the 
agreed performance 
indicators 
in 
the project 
scenario. 
The 
progressive 
reduction 
of 
border 
crossing 
entry time 
(from 
entering 
the border 
area 
in 
one 
country 
to 
exiting 
the 
border 
area 
in 
the 
next 
country) 
to 
forty 
minutes 
for incoming 
traffic, 
in 
line 
with 
the 
performance 
targets, has 
been used 
as 
the 
basis 
to 
calculate 
the transport 
cost savings 
with 
the project. 
Without 
the project, 
only minimal 
reduction 
in 
waiting 
time 
is 
expected. 
This 
waiting time 
reduction 
without 
the 
project 
compared 
to 
the current performance 
is 
based 
on 
estimates 
of 
modernization 
progress 
without 
the 
project 
using 
regional 
experience 
in 
border 
agency 
reform. 
Processing 
time 
without 
the 
project 
was 
estimated 
to be 
reduced 
: 
(i) 
from 
500 
minutes 
in 
2004 
to 
350 
minutes 
by 
2010 
at 
the 
Chisinau 
clearance 
terminal; 
and 
(ii) 
by 
10 
minutes annually 
from 
year 2005 
to 2007 
at 
border crossing 
points. 
The 
absence 
of 
needed 
telecommunication 
infrastructure, 
improved 
procedures 
and 
layout 
would 
impose 
a 
limit 
to 
the 
efficiency 
that 
could 
be 
achieved 
(in 
terms 
of 
selective 
processing and 
pre-clearance). 
Trade

Traffic 
volume/existing

The 
average 
value 
of 
time 
for 
trucks 
was 
obtained 
through interviews 
(US$350/day) 
in 
Moldova 
and 
in 
the 
rest 
of 
Southeast 
Europe, 
and 
is 
conservative compared 
to 
other 
studies 
carried out 
in 
the region, 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
truck 
fleet. 
Traffic 
recovery 
would 
be 
dependent 
particularly 
on 
further 
integration 
of 
Moldova 
in 
regional 
trade 
and 
trade 
with 
the 
European 
Union. Overall traffic 
growth 
was 
assumed 
at 
3 
percent 
for 
the 
period 
under 
study 
compared 
to 
current 
traffic.

of 
critical 
items: 
The internal 
rate-of-return 
would 
remain 
above 
12 
percent 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
drop 
in 
traffic 
by 
22 
percent, 
or 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a lesser 
economic 
impact 
on 
trade 
than 
expected. 
If 
no 
traffic growth 
was 
to 
occur 
over 
the 
next 
7 
years, 
the 
IRR 
would 
be 
22 
percent. 
The 
low 
level 
of traffic 
experienced 
in 
Moldova 
calls 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
high 
impact-low 
cost 
measures. 
This 
has 
been reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design, 
which 
does 
not 
include large 
infrastructure 
investments, 
but 
rather 
focuses 
on 
procedural and 
information 
improvements.

January 
1999, 
and 
May 
2002). 
Procurement Responsibility 
All 
procurement 
will 
be 
carried out 
by 
the 
Project 
Implementation 
Team 
(PIT) 
located 
in 
the 
Moldovan 
Department 
of 
Customs 
(MDC). 
A 
full-time 
procurement 
specialist was selected 
during 
the 
Bank's 
post-appraisal 
mission 
of 
September 2002, 
and 
hired 
in 
October 2002 
to 
carry out 
the procurement 
activities 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
procurement 
specialist 
would 
include 
inter 
alia: 
(i) 
preparing 
and 
submitting 
to 
IDA 
all 
procurement 
documents 
under 
the project; 
(ii) 
carrying out 
any 
procurement 
action; 
(iii) 
updating and submitting 
to 
IDA 
the 
procurement plan; 
(iv) 
updating 
the General 
Procurement 
Notice 
and 
prepare Special Procurement 
Notices; 
and 
(v) 
ensuring that the procurement 
process 
is 
conducted 
based 
on 
the 
Bank's 
procurement Guidelines. 
Procurement Capacity 
Assessment 
of 
the 
PIT 
An 
assessment 
of 
the 
PIT 
capacity 
to 
conduct procurement 
was 
carried 
out 
in 
November 
2001, 
and 
updated 
during 
appraisal 
in 
June, 
2002. 
During 
the 
assessment 
it 
was 
determined that 
MDC 
had 
no 
previous 
experience 
in 
Bank 
procurement, 
while 
a 
Public 
Procurement 
Law 
was 
adopted 
in 
1997, 
and 
a 
National 
Procurement 
Agency 
was established 
in 
1998 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Bank. 
Due 
to 
the 
improvements 
that 
are 
still 
needed 
in 
the current legislation, the generally 
confusing legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
in 
the 
country, 
and 
the 
MDC 
lack 
of 
experience 
in 
Bank's procurement, the 
PIT 
is 
rated 
high 
risk. 
An 
action 
plan to 
enhance 
the 
PIT 
capacity 
to 
conduct 
procurement 
was prepared. 
This 
action 
plan 
stipulates that the 
PIT 
will: 
(i) 
formulate 
operational 
procedures 
related 
to 
procurement 
(participants, 
roles, signatory 
powers) 
including 
ethical behavior 
by 
the 
procurement 
staff; 
(ii) 
hire 
international 
procurement 
consultants 
as 
needed 
during 
implementation, 
with 
experience 
in 
World 
Bank 
procurement 
procedures 
and 
practices; 
(iii) 
build 
up 
the capacity 
of 
the procurement 
staff; 
and 
(iv) 
use 
Bank 
standard 
and 
sample 
bidding 
documents. 
Training 
During 
project 
preparation, basic 
procurement 
training 
was conducted 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
PIT. 
It 
included 
a 
presentation 
of 
the 
Bank 
Guidelines 
(Works, Goods 
and 
Consultants) 
and 
of 
the 
Bank 
Standard Documents. 
The 
PIT 
procurement 
staff 
attended 
formal 
training 
on 
Bank 
standard 
procurement 
rules 
and 
procedures 
in 
November 
2002. 
Notification 
of 
Business 
Opportunities 
A 
General 
Procurement 
Notice 
will 
be 
published 
by 
September 
2003 
to 
announce 
the 
bidding 
opportunities 
under 
the 
project and 
invite 
interested 
eligible 
suppliers 
and 
consultants 
to 
express 
interest 
and 
request 
any 
additional 
information 
from 
the 
PIT. 
The 
General Procurement

by 
the 
Association 
of 
civil 
works contracts: 
one 
contract 
for 
the 
supply 
of 
civil 
works 
estimated 
to 
cost 
the equivalent 
of 
USS 
100,000 
or 
more 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
prior 
review. 
All 
other 
contracts 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
post 
review. 
(ii) 
Goods 
International 
Competitive Bidding 
(ICB): 
would 
be 
used

from 
at 
least three suppliers 
from 
at 
least 
two 
different 
countries, 
which 
may 
include 
the

To 
minimize 
the 
risk 
of 
getting 
only 
one 
or 
two 
quotations, 
clients 
are 
advised 
to 
initially 
request 
more 
than 
three quotations. 
The 
Borrower may 
also 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
request, 
verify 
whether 
those 
being 
invited 
will 
make an 
offer 
or 
not. Quotation

foreign 
goods 
located 
in 
the 
Borrower 
country and 
offered 
by 
a 
firm 
located 
in 
the 
Borrower 
country, 
are 
considered 
as 
quoted 
from 
abroad 
for 
purposes 
of 
satisfying 
the 
“two 
different 
countries” 
rule.

Capacity 
of 
the 
Implementing 
Agency 
in 
Procurement 
and 
Technical 
Assistance 
Requirements 
Brief 
Statement 
A 
capacity 
assessment 
of 
the 
Borrower 
was 
conducted 
during  project 
preparation, 
and  updated 
during 
appraisal. 
The Borrower 
has 
no 
previous 
experience 
with 
Bank or 
other 
IF1 
procurement  and 
the 
national 
procurement 
legislation 
is 
now 
under 
review 
to 
be aligned 
to 
internationally 
acceptable 
principles 
for public 
procurement. 
Therefore, 
an action 
plan 
was prepared 
to 
enable 
the 
Borrower 
to 
conduct procurement 
under 
the 
project 
in 
accordance 
with 
IDA 
procurement 
procedures.

Procurement 
Action 
Plan 
As 
part 
of 
the 
pre-appraisal 
mission 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
Moldovan 
Department 
of 
Customs (the Agency) 
to 
implement 
procurement was 
carried 
out. 
The 
assessment 
was 
updated 
during

The Agency 
has 
no 
previous 
experience 
in 
Bank 
procurement

of 
the 
weaknesses 
identified 
and 
develop 
the

of 
the 
Agency 
to

Special Account. 
To 
facilitate project 
implementation, 
the 
Borrower 
would 
establish 
a 
Special 
Account 
in 
a 
commercial 
bank 
on 
terms and 
conditions 
satisfactory 
to 
IDA 
-based 
on 
the 
ongoing Country 
Financial Accountability 
Assessment- 
to 
cover 
the 
share 
of 
expenditures 
by 
IDA. 
The Authorized 
Allocation for 
this 
special account 
would 
be

500,000, 
representing 
about 
four 
months 
of 
average 
expenditures 
made 
through

stage 
of

the 
initial 
allocation 
to 
the 
Special

would 
be limited to

However, 
when 
the 
disbursements 
under 
the 
Credit 
have 
reached 
the 
level 
of 
SDRl.5 
million, 
the 
initial 
allocation 
may 
be 
increased 
up 
to 
the 
Authorized

by 
submitting 
the

Management 
1. 
Country Issues 
The 
current 
Country Financial Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA)  for 
Moldova 
as 
of 
September 
26, 
1995 
was 
prepared 
at 
a 
time 
of 
considerable 
transition 
and 
therefore, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
time 
that 
has 
since 
elapsed, 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
out-of-date. 
A 
revised 
CFAA 
is 
under 
preparation. 
The 
Interim-PRSP 
of 
November 
15, 
2000 
confirms 
that 
improvement 
is 
required 
in 
the management 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
including 
the  budget 
process 
and 
budget 
execution, 
as 
well 
as 
cash  and  debt 
management. 
Thus 
the 
PIT 
has 
developed 
policies 
and 
procedures that operate 
in 
addition 
to 
those 
of 
the 
current 
public 
expenditure 
management 
framework 
to minimize 
project financial 
management 
risks. 
The 
Bank 
conducted 
a 
Country 
Portfolio  Financial 
Management 
Review 
(CPFMR) 
of 
all 
projects 
under 
implementation 
in 
Moldova 
and 
identified 
some 
common 
financial 
management 
issues; 
the 
Bank 
confirmed 
that 
all 
such 
issues 
have 
been appropriately 
addressed 
in 
the 
design 
of 
the 
TTFSE 
Project’s 
financial 
management 
arrangements. 
2. 
Strengths 
and 
weaknesses 
The 
significant 
strengths 
that 
provide 
a 
basis 
of 
reliance 
on 
the 
project financial 
management 
system 
include: 
(i) 
the experience gained 
by 
the 
PIT 
staff 
over 
the 
past 
period 
in 
implementing the 
PPF and 
satisfying 
Bank 
financial 
management requirements; 
and 
(ii) 
PIT 
ring 
fencing 
(centralized) 
arrangements 
and simple 
funds 
flow. 
There 
are 
no 
significant 
weaknesses 
of 
the 
project financial 
management 
system. 
3, 
Implementing Entity 
The 
PIT 
was established 
by 
Government 
Decision 
in 
April 
2002 
as 
a 
legal entitywith 
its 
own 
statute, 
created 
specifically 
to 
implement 
the 
TTFSE 
IDA-financed 
project. 
The 
PIT 
reports 
to 
the 
Moldovan 
Customs 
Department 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. 
4. 
Flow 
of 
Funds 
Project 
funds 
will 
flow 
from: 
(i) 
IDA, 
either 
via 
a 
single Special 
Account 
which 
will 
be 
replenished 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
SOEs 
or 
by 
direct 
payment 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
direct 
payment 
withdrawal 
applications; and 
(ii) 
the Government, 
via 
the Treasury 
at 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
(MOF) 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
payment 
requests 
prepared 
by 
the 
PIT. 
The  Credit 
Agreement 
will 
be 
signed  between  the 
IDA 
and 
the 
Government 
of 
Moldova. 
The 
Government 
will 
authorize the 
PIT 
to 
use 
the credit 
proceeds. 
There 
will 
be 
a 
single 
SA 
for 
the 
whole 
project 
implementation. 
The 
PIT 
will 
execute the 
payments 
from 
the Government 
contribution 
directly 
from 
the Government 
contribution 
account opened at 
the Treasury 
within 
MOF. 
5. 
Staffing 
The 
PIT 
includes 
a 
Manager, 
an 
Accountant 
and 
a 
Procurement 
Specialist.

The 
PIT 
has 
no 
internal 
audit 
function 
and  none 
is 
considered 
necessary 
given 
the 
size 
of 
the 
organization. 
8. 
External Audit 
As 
the 
PIT 
is 
newly 
created, 
there 
is 
no 
track 
record 
regarding 
the 
external 
audit. 
The 
PIT 
has 
developed 
audit 
terms 
of 
reference 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank, 
to 
include 
the 
audit 
of 
the 
TTFSE 
Project financial 
statements, 
SOEs 
and 
Special 
Account. 
The 
audit 
of 
the project 
will 
be 
conducted 
by 
independent 
private 
auditors 
acceptable 
to 
the Bank, 
on 
terms 
of 
reference 
acceptable 
to 
IDA, 
and 
procured 
by 
the 
PIT 
through 
the 
Least-Cost 
Selection 
procurement 
process. 
The 
annual 
audited project financial 
statements 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
IDA 
within 
six 
months 
of 
the end 
of 
each 
fiscal 
year 
and 
also 
at 
the 
closing 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
contract 
for 
the 
audit 
awarded 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
project implementation 
and 
thereafter 
may 
be 
extended 
from 
year-to-year 
with 
the 
same 
auditor, 
subject 
to 
satisfactory 
performance. 
The 
costs 
of 
the 
audits 
would 
be 
financed 
from 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
IDA 
Credit. 
The 
Project 
has 
received 
in 
January 2003 
an audit waiver 
for 
the 
PPF 
audit 
of 
the 
period 
ended 
31 
December 
2002, 
due 
to 
the 
low 
amounts 
disbursed 
up 
to 
that 
date. 
It 
was 
thus 
agreed that 
the 
first 
audit 
will 
cover the 
main 
TTFSE 
project 
for 
the 
period 
ended 
3 1 
December 
2003 
as 
well 
as 
the 
related 
PPF entirely, 
from 
the 
beginning 
until 
the 
close 
of 
the 
PPF 
in 
2003. 
The 
MCD 
would 
be 
audited 
annually 
by 
the 
Moldovan 
Supreme 
Audit 
Institution, 
the 
Court 
of 
Accounts 
and 
the results 
of 
this 
audit 
would 
be 
shared 
with 
IDA 
within 
six 
months 
of 
the end 
of 
each 
fiscal 
year. 
In 
addition, the 
Moldovan 
Court 
of 
Accounts,  the country’s 
supreme 
audit institution, performs 
ad 
hoc 
extemal 
audits 
of 
the 
PIT 
activities.

The 
PIT 
produces 
all 
financial 
reports 
for 
IDA 
and 
Government 
with 
its 
existing 
customized 
project 
software 
system, 
that 
it 
is 
able 
to 
report 
accurately and 
timely 
on 
project 
expenditures. 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs) 
will 
be 
used 
for 
project 
monitoring 
and  supervision  and 
the 
indicative formats 
of 
these are 
included 
in 
the 
project financial 
procedures 
manual. 
The 
PIT 
will 
produce 
a 
full 
set 
of 
FMRs 
every 
(calendar) 
quarter 
throughout the 
life 
of 
the project. 
10. 
In 
formation 
Systems 
The 
PIT 
information 
systems 
comprises 
a 
fully 
customized 
accounting, 
reporting 
and 
monitoring 
software, 
which 
is 
used 
for 
presenting 
all 
needed 
project financial 
reports, 
for both 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
Government, 
denominated 
in 
US$ 
and 
Moldovan 
Lei, 
respectively. 
11. 
Disbursement Arrangements 
IDA 
funds 
will 
be 
disbursed 
under the 
World 
Bank’s 
traditional 
procedures 
including 
SOEs 
and direct 
payments. 
Supporting 
documentation 
for 
SOEs, 
including 
completion 
reports 
and 
certificates, 
will 
be 
retained 
by 
the 
Borrower 
and 
made 
available 
to 
IDA 
during 
project 
supervision. 
Disbursements 
for 
expenditures above 
the 
SOE 
thresholds 
will 
be 
made 
against 
presentation 
of 
full 
documentation relating 
to 
those 
expenditures.  There 
is 
no 
plan 
to 
move to 
periodic 
disbursements. 
The 
PIT 
will 
open and 
manage  a 
Special 
Account 
specifically 
for 
this 
project, 
in 
a 
commercial bank 
acceptable 
to 
the Bank, 
including 
appropriate 
protection 
against 
set-off,  seizure 
and 
attachment 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
commercial 
bank. 
Withdrawal 
applications 
for 
the 
replenishments 
of 
the 
SA 
would 
be 
sent 
to 
the 
WB 
monthly, 
sooner 
if 
desired, 
or 
quarterly 
at 
the 
latest,  regardless 
of 
the 
amount. 
Authorized 
allocation 
for 
the 
SA 
would 
be 
of 
$0.5 
million. 
,

Supervision 
Plan 
During 
project 
implementation, 
the 
Bank 
will 
supervise 
the project’s 
financial 
management 
arrangements 
in 
two main 
ways: 
(i) 
review 
the project’s 
quarterly 
financial 
management 
reports 
as 
well 
as 
the project’s 
annual 
audited  financial 
statements 
and 
auditor’s 
management  letter; 
and 
(ii) 
during 
the  Bank’s 
supervision 
missions, 
review 
the 
project’s 
financial 
management 
and 
disbursement 
arrangements 
(including 
a 
review 
of 
a sample 
of 
SOEs 
and 
movements 
on 
the 
Special 
Account) 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
Bank’s 
minimum 
requirements. 
As 
required, 
a 
World 
Bank-accredited 
Financial 
Management 
Specialist 
will 
assist 
in 
the 
supervision 
process.

CHAPTER 
I: 
Introduction 
Brief 
history 
of 
the 
Moldovan Department 
of 
Customs 
(MDC) 
The 
Department 
of 
Customs 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Moldova 
was 
established 
on 
September 
4, 
1991. 
The 
Presidential Decree 
provided 
for 
the transfer 
of 
all 
old 
customs 
offices located 
in 
Moldova to 
the 
administration 
of 
the Government 
of 
the 
Republic of 
Moldova. 
At 
that 
time 
in 
the Republic 
of 
Moldova 
the 
following 
customs 
offices 
were 
operating: 
Ungheni, 
Leuseni 
and 
Chisinau.. 
Moldova’s 
own 
customs system 
has 
been established 
as 
an emergency 
measure 
under 
the 
conditions 
of 
that time. 
Shortly 
crossing 
border 
posts were 
established, 
and 
staff 
with 
a 
general 
perspective 
on 
the specifics 
of 
the 
customs 
activity 
hired. 
The 
following 
four 
customs 
units 
were 
established 
on 
the 
Romanian 
border 
during 
1992: 
Sculeni,  Costesti, 
Cahul 
and Giurgiulesti. 
Ungheni 
and 
Leuseni 
customs 
offices 
were 
also reorganized. 
During 
1992-1993 
22 
crossing 
border 
posts 
on 
the 
border 
with 
Ukraine 
began 
their activity. 
They 
were 
legalized 
in 
1993 
by 
the 
Agreement between the 
Moldovan 
and 
Ukrainian 
Governments 
“On 
the crossing 
of 
the customs 
border 
posts”. 
The 
Parliament 
passed 
the Customs Code 
in 
1993, 
which 
is 
the 
main 
legislative document that 
regulates 
the 
organization 
principles and the 
entire 
activity 
of 
the 
customs 
service. 
Regulations 
on 
exercising 
the 
duties 
by 
the 
governing 
body 
of 
the 
state 
Customs 
control 
authorities 
and the 
disciplinary 
statute 
of 
the 
state 
customs 
control 
authorities 
of 
the 
RM 
were 
approved 
in 
1992. 
Since 
October 1994 
the 
Republic 
of 
Moldova 
has 
become 
a 
plenipotentiary member 
of 
the 
World 
Customs 
Union 
among 
142 
other 
states. 
From 
the 
very beginning 
the Customs 
System 
has 
undergone 
a 
continuous 
process 
of 
improvement. 
Functions 
1.Optimization 
of 
Customs 
control 
technologies 
depending 
on 
the specific 
sector 
of 
activity. 
The 
task 
has 
been 
carried out 
by 
passing and enforcing 
the Government’s Decree 
808 
(2000) 
“On 
the 
interaction 
of 
services, 
regulation 
of 
duties 
collection 
and automation 
of 
the records 
system 
for 
the 
inspections 
at the 
crossing 
posts 
on 
the 
state 
border 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Moldova”. 
According 
to 
this 
decision 
Sculeni Customs 
Ofice 
became 
a 
pilot-site 
for 
testing 
the 
implementation 
procedures 
of 
optimization 
and 
facilitation 
the 
passengers’ 
and 
goods’ 
traffic 
and 
the 
reduction 
to 
the 
minimum 
of 
the clearance 
time.

infrastructure,

officers, 
enhancement 
of 
their 
professional 
skills. 
The 
core 
of 
the 
customs 
system 
of 
the 
republic 
consisted 
of 
200 
staff 
members 
that 
had 
been 
worlung 
until 
1991 
within 
the 
customs 
structures 
of 
the 
former 
Soviet 
Union. 
At 
present 
the 
Moldovan 
Department 
of 
Customs 
(MDC) 
includes 
18 
offices 
across 
the 
country: 
6 
- 
on 
the 
border 
with 
Romania, 
6 
- 
on 
the border 
with 
the 
Ukraine, 
the 
Airport 
Customs 
office, 
and 
four 
inland 
customs 
offices. 
28 
border 
crossing 
posts 
and 
36 
internal 
customs representative 
offices 
operate 
within 
these 
subdivisions. 
On 
April 
1,2001 the 
Customs 
staff 
of 
Moldova 
consisted 
of 
1,678 
officers. 
The 
MDC 
staff 
is 
trained 
not only 
internally 
but 
also 
with 
the 
support 
of 
customs 
services 
of 
other 
countries: 
USA, 
Italy, 
France, 
Russia, 
Ukraine 
etc. 
3. 
Fighting 
smuggling 
and 
violations 
of 
customs 
rules. 
Fighting 
customs 
fraud 
is 
one 
of 
the 
main 
tasks 
of 
customs authorities. 
The 
Department 
of 
Customs 
is 
undertaking different 
measures 
on 
a 
permanent 
basis 
in 
order 
to 
stop 
illicit 
traffic 
of 
goods 
and 
objects. 
Specialized 
units 
for 
fighting 
customs 
fraud 
were 
created 
both 
within 
the 
central 
apparatus 
and 
in 
the 
territory. 
On 
July 
15, 
1999 
Customs 
officers 
by 
way 
of 
respective 
amendments 
to 
the 
Criminal 
Procedures 
Code 
were entitled 
to 
file 
criminal 
cases 
related 
to 
smuggling 
that 
has 
considerably increased 
the 
efficiency 
of 
fighting 
smuggling 
4. 
Collection 
of 
customs 
duties 
One 
of 
the 
significant 
aspects 
of 
the 
customs 
activity 
is 
the 
economic 
aspect 
- 
the 
collection 
of 
customs duties. 
Duties 
and 
fees 
collected 
by 
customs 
authorities 
are 
increasing 
each 
year. 
At 
present 
customs 
revenues represent 
about 
60 
% 
of 
the 
volume 
of 
state 
budget collections. 
5. 
Promotion 
of 
Legislation 
Each 
year the 
Moldovan 
Customs Department 
submits 
to 
the Government and the Parliament various 
draft 
Normative Acts 
aimed 
at 
improving 
the 
customs 
legislation and 
bringing 
it 
in 
compliance 
with 
the international 
standards. 
As 
to 
the 
most 
recent 
achievements 
could 
be 
mentioned: 
. 
Adoption 
by 
the Parliament 
on 
July, 
20, 
2000 
of 
the 
Customs Code 
of 
Moldova 
in 
the 
new 
version. 
. 
The 
adoption 
by 
the Parliament 
on 
July, 
20,2000 
of 
the 
Law 
on 
customs service 
and 
customs 
authorities 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Moldova” 
. 
Reorganization 
of 
the Customs 
Department 
structure 
- 
Government 
Decision 
nr. 
232 
/ 
27.03.2001 
. 
The 
Government 
Decision 
nr. 
808 
(2000) 
“On 
interaction 
of 
services, 
payments 
collections 
regulation 
and automation 
of 
registration 
system 
during 
the 
inspections 
at 
the 
crossing 
border 
posts 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Moldova”. 
6. 
Cooperation 
with 
similar 
international 
structures 
In 
1993 
the 
Republic 
of 
Moldova 
joined 
the 
Board 
of 
Customs 
Directors 
of 
CIS 
countries. 
So 
far 
under 
this 
initiative 
meetings 
of 
experts 
and 
customs 
directors 
have 
been 
held 
on 
different problems 
related to 
the 
cooperation between 
customs 
services. 
In 
2001 
the 
country 
entered 
the 
World 
Trade Organization. 
7. 
Promotion 
of 
trade 
-

Page  68
A 
major 
function 
of 
the 
MDC 
is 
to 
facilitate 
legitimate 
trade 
and transit 
flows 
- 
while 
preventing 
illegal 
imports 
and 
exports 
- 
and 
to 
ensure 
cooperation 
with 
other 
national border 
agencies, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
the 
other 
Customs 
services. 
To 
achieve 
the 
EU 
best 
standards 
and consistency 
with 
the 
Geneva 
Convention 
on 
Border 
controls 
the 
MCD 
sees 
its 
graduating 
role 
from 
an 
essentially 
revenue 
collection activity 
to 
a 
more 
global 
responsibility 
ensuring 
that 
all 
goods 
crossing the 
border 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
relevant legislation. 
Trade 
is 
very 
significant 
to 
the 
Republic 
of 
Moldova’s 
economy, 
representing 
an 
average 
of 
above 
95 
% 
of 
GDP 
for 
the 
last 
years 
(1 
998-2000). 
The 
trade 
is 
mainly 
oriented 
towards the 
CIS 
countries, 
with 
the 
main 
trading 
parties 
being 
Russia 
(about 
45 
percent) 
and 
Ukraine, 
followed 
by 
Romania 
and 
EU 
countries (Italy, 
Germany). 
8. 
Keeping 
Customs 
statistical 
records and 
computerization 
of 
the Customs 
system 
At 
present 
Moldovan 
Customs 
is 
equipped 
with 
computers 
and other technical 
means 
which 
help 
keep 
records 
of 
export‘import 
operations. 
In 
view 
of 
raising 
the 
necessary 
funds 
for 
modernization 
and 
development 
of 
the 
customs 
informational 
system, 
negotiations 
with 
the 
World 
Bank 
and related 
international 
structures 
are 
being 
conducted. 
Fostering 
“open 
doors” 
policy 
contributes 
to 
the 
permanent expanding 
of 
the 
Moldova’s 
commercial 
relations 
with 
other 
states 
of 
the world. 
In 
the 
past 
years 
the 
Moldovan 
economic 
agents 
concluded commercial 
transactions 
with 
over 
90 
states. 
The 
increasing 
number 
of 
international 
contracts 
primarily 
requires 
establishment 
of 
collaboration 
with 
the 
customs 
services 
from 
the 
neighboring 
countries, 
Moldova’s 
largest 
trade 
partners. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
as 
a 
WCO 
member 
the 
Customs 
service 
of 
our 
country 
is 
bound 
to 
meet 
in 
its 
activity 
certain internationally 
recognized 
standards. 
Based 
on 
the fact 
that the 
main 
tasks 
of 
the 
customs authorities 
in 
terms 
of 
foreign 
affairs 
are 
harmonization 
of 
the 
Customs 
law 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
foreign 
trade, 
unifying 
and 
facilitating 
the 
customs procedures, 
fighting 
smuggling 
and 
tax 
evasions 
as 
well 
as 
exchanging 
the 
information 
- 
the 
MDC 
is 
worlung 
on 
establishing connections 
and 
direct 
contacts 
with 
the 
customs 
services 
of 
other 
countries, 
a 
fact that 
emphasize 
the importance 
of 
regional 
integration. 
CHAPTER 
11: 
Main 
outline 
of 
the 
modernization 
strategic 
plan 
General 
perspective 
The 
MDC’s 
modernization 
strategy 
is 
aimed at achieving 
EU 
best-practice 
standards 
(including 
integrated 
border 
management), 
and 
consistency 
with 
numerous 
international 
conventions, such 
as 
the 
WTO, 
and, 
as 
far 
as 
border 
management 
is 
concerned, 
the 
Geneva 
Convention 
on 
simplification 
of 
border 
controls. 
The overall objective 
is 
to 
combat 
smuggling 
and 
reduce 
corruption. 
Customs 
is 
the 
sole 
administration 
responsible 
for 
the 
verification 
of 
goods, 
persons, 
and 
means 
of 
transport 
used 
to 
caw 
them, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
(i) 
collecting 
all 
taxes 
and 
duties due on 
imported 
goods, 
or 
on other 
foreign 
trade related 
transactions, 
or 
(ii) 
enforcing  the 
legislation 
that 
may 
apply 
to 
them, 
as 
decided 
by 
the 
Government. 
This 
implies 
a 
definition 
of 
the 
role 
of 
Customs, 
and 
other 
agencies 
involved 
in 
the 
management, 
control, and 
enforcement, 
of 
cross-border 
activities 
(passengers, 
vehicles, 
and 
commercial 
goods), 
more 
in 
terms 
of 
objectives 
than 
organization. 
It 
must 
take 
into 
account the 
unique 
ability 
of 
Customs 
to 
identify 
goods, 
search means 
of 
transport, 
and 
ensure 
coordination 
with 
other 
revenue 
agencies. 
In 
- 
64 
- 
Page  69
that perspective, the 
MDC 
will 
graduate 
- 
like 
other Customs administrations 
in 
EU 
or 
OECD 
countries 
- 
from 
an 
essentially 
revenue 
collection 
activity 
to 
a 
more global responsibility 
ensuring 
that 
all 
goods crossing the border 
are 
submitted 
to 
the relevant legislation, and 
contributing 
to 
prevent 
illegal 
traffics, 
both 
of 
persons 
and 
goods. 
This 
will 
lead 
Customs 
to 
(i) 
exercise 
a 
major 
support 
- 
and 
eventually 
coordination 
- 
role 
over 
all 
controls 
performed 
by 
other 
border 
agencies 
and 
related 
to 
the import, 
export, and transit, 
of 
goods, 
with 
correlated 
streamlining 
of 
procedures, 
and 
(ii) 
improve 
compliance 
through 
better detection 
and prosecution 
of 
offences, 
and 
an 
expanded 
enforcement 
capacity. 
The introduction 
of 
the 
“single 
window 
payment” 
concept, 
and 
the 
legislation 
related 
to 
it, 
is 
a 
very 
significant 
first 
step, 
and 
a 
clear 
indication 
of 
the 
commitment 
of 
the 
MDC 
to 
achieve 
these 
objectives. 
The 
Transnistria 
issue 
will 
require 
a 
specific 
strategic 
sub-component, 
but 
addressing 
it 
can 
be 
envisaged 
through more 
thorough 
Customs operations. 
The 
steps 
which 
must 
be 
undertaken 
are 
broadly 
categorized below, and 
all 
aim 
at 
(i) 
improving 
professionalism 
within 
the 
MCA, 
in 
particular 
by 
combating 
corruption, 
(ii) 
streamlining activities 
and developing 
effectiveness 
through 
improved 
procedures and organization, 
(iii) 
provide 
for 
an 
integrated approach 
to 
revenue 
collection, 
while 
safeguarding 
Customs 
specific 
position 
in 
the 
Moldovan 
administration. 
Review 
procedures 
and 
operations 
. 
Reinforce 
control 
and 
management 
of 
transit, 
as 
Moldova 
could 
become 
again 
a 
major 
transit 
country 
when 
the Transnistia 
issue 
is 
resolved, 
and 
adheres 
to 
the 
TIR 
convention. 
Considering 
the 
delays 
currently 
experienced 
at 
border 
crossings, 
or 
for 
obtaining 
the 
release 
of 
cleared 
goods 
(these 
delays 
may not 
always 
be 
due 
to 
the 
action 
ofcustoms, 
but 
would 
be 
significantly reduced 
if 
Customs 
could 
take 
the 
lead 
in 
streamlining 
verification 
procedures), 
this 
implies drastically 
improved 
processing 
of 
trucks, supported 
by 
targeted 
or 
spot 
checks, 
computerized 
exchanges 
of 
data 
between 
checkpoints and 
across 
borders, 
a 
reliable 
guarantee 
system, 
and 
the 
capacity 
to 
use transit 
data 
for 
the automated preparation 
of 
inland 
clearance declarations. These 
measures 
should 
also 
accommodate the envisaged 
computerization 
of 
the 
TR 
carnet, 
and 
future 
developments 
in 
the 
European 
Unions 
New 
Computerized 
Transit 
system 
(NCTS), 
as 
well 
as 
future 
accession 
to 
the 
Common 
Transit 
convention. 
Considering 
the 
lack 
of 
effectiveness 
of 
fiscal 
checkpoints 
on 
the 
Nistru, 
a 
new 
system, 
based 
on 
Customs 
mobile 
controls 
along Moldova’s 
highways, 
would 
need 
to 
be 
developed. 
. 
Introduce 
selectivitv. 
The 
current 
practice 
of 
inspecting most 
declarations 
will 
be 
replaced 
by 
computer-determined 
selective 
verifications. 
The 
MDC 
has 
(i) 
obtained the 
necessary changes 
in 
the 
Customs 
law 
The 
current 
Customs 
law 
states 
that Customs 
may 
physically 
examine 
consignments, 
but 
does 
not 
need 
to 
do 
so 
in 
every 
case., 
and 
(ii) 
will 
establish and 
maintain 
a 
selectivity 
data 
base 
linked to 
other 
administrations,  thus 
enabling 
its 
use 
for 
other, 
non- 
revenue-related, 
verifications, 
and the sharing 
of 
information 
with 
revenue 
agencies, 
in 
view 
of 
improving 
compliance 
and 
detecting 
frauds. 
. 
Develop 
a 
valuation control 
svstem. 
A 
significant number 
of 
declarations 
contain 
errors 
or 
frauds 
linked to 
the 
valuation 
of 
goods, 
which 
are 
difficult 
to 
document and 
prove, 
especially 
under 
the 
GATT 
valuation 
code. 
The 
current organization 
and 
skills 
available 
within 
the 
MDC 
Customs 
are 
not 
sufficient 
to 
ensure consistent, transparent, 
and 
effective, compliance 
with 
international 
valuation 
standards, 
while 
detecting 
frauds. 
The 
MDC 
should 
therefore 
introduce 
the 
administrative 
- 
65 
- 
Page  70
capacity 
to 
follow-up 
on 
valuation 
queries, 
investigate 
cases, 
develop 
training, and 
cooperate 
with 
other administrations. 
This 
necessitates 
(i) 
adequate 
training, 
(ii) 
a 
selective approach 
to 
verifications, 
based 
on 
experience 
as 
it 
builds 
up, 
and 
other 
sources 
of 
intelligence, 
and 
(iii) 
a 
post-release 
audit 
capacity 
which 
will 
develop 
as 
the 
overall 
organization 
of 
trade 
in 
Moldova 
increasingly 
provides 
for 
the 
ability to 
identify 
and prosecute offenders. 
In 
particular, 
the 
MDC 
will 
use 
the 
limitedperiod 
of 
time 
during 
which 
Pre-Shipment Inspection 
(PSg 
services 
will 
be

these

the

therefore 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
take 
over 
all 
valuation

With 
VAT, 
Customs 
play 
a 
major role 
in 
identifying 
imported 
goods 
and 
assessing 
their 
value. 
Similarly, the certification 
of 
exports 
by 
Customs 
will 
determine 
VAT 
refunds. 
For 
these reasons, 
very 
close 
operational and technical 
contacts 
will 
be 
established 
between 
n 
the Customs 
and tax 
administrations,  supported 
by 
regular computerized 
exchanges 
of 
data, 
notably 
for 
audit 
purposes,

of 
both

the 
banking

(i) 
an 
extension 
of 
payment 
hours, 
(ii) 
the 
possibility, 
for 
approved and 
reliable 
importers, 
to 
rely 
on 
a guaranteed 
payment 
scheme, 
and 
(iii) 
the 
introduction, 
in 
the 
future, 
of 
electronic 
payment 
systems. 
The 
current single 
window 
system 
will 
be 
further 
expanded 
to 
enable 
release 
of 
, 
goods, 
throughout 
the 
country, 
as 
they 
are cleared, 
and 
not 
as 
the

is 
paid 
(for 
reliable 
importers).

Prepare

The 
current practice 
of 
accepting 
declarations 
only 
when 
Customs 
are 
satisfied 
that 
they 
are 
correctly filled, 
which 
is 
not 
entirely 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
EU 
Customs 
code, 
may 
encourage non-transparent 
activities. 
Brokers 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
improve 
their 
professional 
standards, 
since 
Customs 
tend 
to 
correct, 
after 
a 
while, 
inadequate declarations. 
This 
could be 
discouraged 
through direct 
computerized 
input 
of 
the 
declarations 
by 
the 
trade, 
better 
control 
over licensed 
brokers, 
and 
clearer 
identification 
of 
importers through 
a 
reliable 
TIN 
system. 
A 
working 
group 
within 
the 
PRO-Committee, and 
including 
Customs, 
should 
also 
examine methods 
of 
streamlining 
document presentation. 
In 
a 
broader 
perspective, 
Customs 
should 
use 
its 
technical 
know-how 
and 
computer 
infrastructure 
to 
promote single-window 
electronic 
filing, 
complementary 
to 
its role 
as 
coordinating 
body 
for 
the 
control 
of 
imported 
and 
exported 
goods.

Corruption 
Although 
the reasons 
for  corruption 
in 
the 
public 
administration, 
and 
in 
Customs 
in 
particular, 
have 
been 
extensively discussed, 
one 
of 
the reasons 
why 
Customs 
officials 
are 
often 
more 
widely 
suspected 
of 
corrupt 
practices 
is 
that, 
more 
than 
other officials, 
they have 
easy 
and 
direct 
access 
to, 
and 
control 
over, 
tangible wealth. 
For 
this 
reason, 
legislation was 
drafted 
and 
procedures established 
based 
on 
a 
presumption 
of 
corruption 
in 
Customs 
for 
example, Customs 
are 
obliged 
to 
inspect 
every 
consignment, 
to 
avoid 
favoritism). 
This 
in 
turn 
encouraged officials 
to 
multiply bureaucratic 
steps 
to 
protect 
themselves, 
and 
created 
a 
non-transparent 
system 
which 
itselfgenerated 
new 
opportunities 
for 
corruption.

The 
Preventive and 
Enforcement 
role 
of 
Customs 
The 
role 
of 
Customs has 
varied in 
Western 
Europe 
over the centuries, 
but 
even 
more 
so 
since 
the 
introduction 
of 
the 
EU 
Single 
Market 
in 
1993. 
Although 
it 
was 
widely 
thought 
before 
that 
Customs 
would 
ultimately 
disappear 
in 
a 
single 
market environment, this 
has 
not 
been 
the 
case, 
much 
to 
the 
contrary. 
In 
spite 
of 
differences 
between

of

Customs services is

Page  73
the 
responsibility 
of 
member 
States 
- 
Customs 
gradually 
became 
involved 
in 
the 
control 
of 
all 
border activities 
(including, 
in 
some 
cases, 
immigration), 
because 
of 
their strategic location 
at 
the 
borders, 
and 
the experience 
they 
had 
acquired. 
Also, 
because 
Customs 
were 
at 
the 
point 
where 
all 
goods 
crossing 
the 
border 
had 
to report, 
it 
became 
convenient 
to 
use 
their 
expertise 
in 
tracking 
consignments 
and 
identifying merchandise 
for 
other, 
non-revenue related, 
purposes: 
thus 
Customs 
have become 
increasingly involved 
in 
checking security 
standards 
for 
imported 
goods, 
certijjing 
the 
origin 
of 
exports, 
selecting 
consignments 
of 
goods subject 
to phyto-sanitary 
or 
other health 
controls, 
assisting 
in 
collecting 
samples 
or 
detecting 
counterfeited goods. 
As 
this 
transformation 
was taking place, 
the 
legislation 
and 
its 
enforcement 
provisions 
evolved, 
based 
on 
the fact  that 
Customs 
were 
more 
interested, 
practically, 
in 
the 
situation 
of 
the merchandise 
than the 
intention 
of 
the 
shipper 
or 
owner. 
This was 
reflected 
in 
the 
legislation, where, unlike 
in 
the 
criminal 
laws, 
the 
intentional 
element 
was 
not prominent, and 
led 
to penalties 
based 
on 
the 
illicit 
profit 
or 
the 
value 
of 
the 
merchandise, 
irrespective 
of 
the 
circumstances. 
Methods 
of 
investigations, 
documenting 
cases, 
and 
prosecution, 
were 
adapted, thus 
creating 
a 
system 
with 
strong 
enforcement. 
In 
return, 
Customs 
had 
to 
provide 
a 
real 
service 
to 
the community, 
and 
are 
widely 
acknowledged 
now 
as 
a 
dynamic 
partner 
and strong 
champion 
of 
trade 
facilitation 
measures. 
This evolution 
was 
followed  in 
parallel 
by 
an 
evolution 
in 
the 
very 
notion 
of 
borders. 
Although 
a 
border 
is, 
geographically, 
the 
separation 
line 
between 
two 
States, 
it 
is 
increasingly also 
the 
place 
where the 
sovereignty 
over persons, vehicles, 
and 
goods, 
is 
established. 
This 
may 
not 
necessarily 
take 
place 
at 
the 
physical 
border 
line.  The 
two 
main 
examples 
are 
(i) 
inland 
clearance facilities  and 
transit 
regimes 
that 
feed 
them, 
and 
(ii) 
border 
checkpoints that 
are 
located 
away 
from 
the 
border, 
sometimes 
on 
the 
territory 
of 
the 
adjacent 
country. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
clearance 
on 
the 
premises 
of 
an 
importer, 
the 
border 
is 
in 
fact 
within 
the 
enterprise. 
However, 
such 
adaptations 
require 
the 
ability for 
Customs 
to perform 
their 
duties 
where 
verifications 
take 
place 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
they 
would 
at 
the 
border, 
both 
to 
deter 
infractions 
breventive 
role) and 
detect them 
(enforcement 
role). 
Although 
there 
is 
little 
difficulty 
regarding 
activities 
at 
inland 
clearance terminals, the present 
legislation 
may 
not 
provide 
Customs 
with 
all 
the 
necessary 
powers 
to 
carry 
out verifications on 
the 
premises 
of 
importers 
or 
agents.  Often 
carried 
out 
in Moldova 
by 
the 
police 
- 
which 
has 
not 
the 
resources, 
training, organizational 
support, 
or 
even 
the 
inclination 
to 
perform 
them 
- 
inland 
checks 
over 
goods 
and 
means 
of 
transport 
(and 
their 
drivers) 
are 
a 
routine 
responsibility 
of 
Customs 
administrations 
in 
many 
countries. 
In 
a 
country 
such 
as 
Moldova, 
where 
the considerable 
volume 
of 
expected 
transit 
makes 
impossible 
any 
systematic 
border 
verijication, 
it 
is 
essential 
that 
the 
agency 
which 
is 
in 
charge 
of 
transit and 
clearance obtains 
the 
legal 
right 
to 
carry 
out, under speclfied conditions, 
inland 
checks. 
To 
perform  this 
task, Customs 
should introduce 
a 
well-structured preventive 
and 
enforcement 
service. 
It 
could 
be 
divided in two 
branches: 
' 
the 
borders, 
mobile controls 
in 
border 
area 
(to 
prevent 
attempts 
at 
smuggling 
across non-authorized 
border 
passages), 
and inland 
mobile controls; 
and 
. 
investigating 
smuggling 
offences. 
The 
Preventive branch, 
essentially 
consisting 
of 
uniformed 
stag 
in 
charge 
of 
static controls 
at 
The 
Enforcement 
branch, 
mainly consisting 
of 
non-uniformed 
stafl 
in 
charge 
of 
detecting 
and 
The placement 
of 
these 
two 
branches 
within 
the 
organization should 
be 
discussed: 
The 
preventive 
and 
enforcement 
service 
could 
be 
unified under the command 
of 
one 
or 
two 
deputy director(s) 
general 
of 
Customs, 
or 
thepreventive branch 
could 
be 
managed 
at district 
level. 
In 
all 
cases, 
both 
- 
69 
- 
Page  74
branches 
should 
work 
in 
close 
cooperation. 
If 
this service 
was 
introduced, 
the workforce 
could 
be 
obtained 
from 
existing 
resources: 
Static 
personnel performing 
passenger 
or 
vehicle 
control 
duties 
at 
the 
borders 
should 
be 
assigned 
to 
the 
preventive 
service, 
and this 
would 
also 
indicate 
visibly 
that 
Customs 
are 
moving 
to 
selective 
or 
targeted 
controls. 
As 
experience grows, 
the 
most 
suited 
officers 
would 
be 
recruited 
by 
the 
Enforcement 
branch. 
Therefore, the 
total 
staffing 
of 
the 
MCA 
would 
not 
increase 
significantly, 
as 
current bureaucratic 
activities 
would 
be 
progressively 
either 
computerized 
and/or 
streamlined. 
Computerize

Computerization 
is 
intended 
to 
serve 
all 
the activities 
of 
the 
MDC, 
and 
assist 
in 
carrying 
out 
the 
objectives 
of 
the modernization 
strategy. 
As 
such, 
it 
is 
less a 
component 
by 
itself, than 
a 
tool. 
However, 
the 
main 
objectives 
of 
the computerized 
system 
(ASYCUDA) 
that 
is 
envisaged 
will 
be 
to: 
. 
Provide 
for 
efficient 
clearance 
of 
goods 
and payment 
of 
duties; 
. 
Ensure risk-based selection 
of 
consignments and 
transactions;

allowing 
coordination

and 
effective 
coordinated 
audits; 
Allow

data 
with 
other 
agencies, 
in 
particular 
the 
tax

of 
its 
contract, 
(ii) 
PSI 
data 
is 
effectively reconciled 
with 
Customs 
procedures, 
and 
(iii) 
the 
MDC 
may 
build 
up 
its 
own 
valuation 
data 
base. 
Precautions 
will 
be 
taken 
to 
maintain 
a 
high 
level 
of 
security 
within 
the 
system.

PSI 
services 
will 
be 
available 
for 
a 
period 
of 
three years 
at the 
most. 
During 
that 
time, 
the 
MDC 
will 
(i) 
follow-up 
on 
results 
provided 
by 
the 
company, 
(ii) 
develop 
its 
own 
technical 
capacity, 
and 
(iii) 
document 
anomalies 
and 
discrepancies. 
Obtain 
the 
necessary 
support 
Before the modernization 
plan 
can 
be 
launched, 
the 
MDC 
needs 
to 
obtain 
strong Government 
support.

at 
Pilot 
Sites 
An 
important 
aspect 
of 
the 
modernization 
plan 
is 
to 
test 
and validate 
new 
concepts 
and 
procedures. 
Several 
border 
sites, 
and 
an 
inland 
clearance 
station 
(Chisinau) 
will 
serve 
for 
the 
collection 
of 
performance 
indicators, 
and, 
through 
a 
local 
project team 
(LPT) 
associating representatives 
of 
all 
control 
agencies 
and 
forwarders, 
will 
progressively 
introduce 
new, 
integrated 
and 
streamlined, 
approaches 
to 
efficient 
clearance 
and 
EU 
best 
practice. 
Measurement 
of 
progress 
The 
MDC 
will 
implement 
a 
set 
of 
performance indicators 
destined 
to 
measure 
progress 
at 
pilot 
sites 
and throughout 
the 
Customs 
administration. 
These 
will 
be 
reviewed 
regularly, 
and 
will 
enable 
short 
term 
impact 
measures.
