3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
According to the Memorandum of the President the initial objectives of the project were to (i) strengthen
the preparation and management of the public investment program (PIP), the budget and improve the
quality of the national accounts; (ii) strengthen staff capabilities in economic and financial management and
establish a permanent Government capability to train its own staff; and (iii) support the Government's
overall economic reform program.
These objectives were appropriate and highly relevant in the context of a country undergoing a far-reaching
structural adjustment program at the beginning of the 1 990s. Nearly twenty years of a Marxist political
and economic system were swept away in elections in 1991 and fundamental reforms to the public
administrative system and the role of the state in economic activities had to be designed and implemented in
a newly democratic political system. The second structural adjustment program (SAP) had just been
adopted by the newly elected government in 1991 and received substantial donor support as befitted the
first successful transition to democracy in sub-Saharan Africa. Implementing the SAP was a major
challenge to GOB, given its limited capabilities in economic management of a market economy. The
project was thus complementary to and an essential part of the overall structural adjustment program that
GOB has pursued during the past decade. Real GDP growth during the 1990s has been consistently above
4-5% annually and both the fiscal and external accounts have shown marked improvements. The civil
service has been streamlined and the number of state enterprises sharply reduced. Today it has the strongest
macroeconomic position and public finances of any West African country.
In accordance with standard practice for such operations, there was no SAR
3.2 Revised Objective:
The project objectives were not significantly modified at the time the project was restructured in 1995,
since they remained relevant and of high priority. The project restructuring was necessary because of the
long delay between appraisal and effectiveness (30 months) during which the prevailing circumstances in
Benin had altered, one of the initial cofinanciers withdrew and also to take account of weaknesses in initial
project design (para 3.5). The restructuring was approved at the level of Country Director, but was not
submitted to the Executive Directors for approval. With hindsight it is clear that the project's development
objectives should have been revised at this time to reflect the changes made to the project components (para
3.4) at the time of restructuring.
3.3 Original Components:
As initially designed, the Project had four components:
* Reorganization of and support to the Ministry of planning in public investment programming,
monitoring and national accounts preparation;
* Support to the Ministry of Finance in budget preparation; monitoring and execution;
* Support to the overall GOB economic reform program;
* Support to CEPAG, a national training center.
3.4 Revised Components.
After restructuring the project had five broad components:
* Support to the Ministry of Plan (unchanged);
* Support to the Ministry of Finance (unchanged);
* Support to key sectoral ministries (new component);
* Support to the overall macroeconomic refonn program (unchanged).
- 2 -



*   Short-term training of civil servants (instead of long term programs and strengthening of CEPAG).
The original project design envisaged the reinforcement of CEPAG to provide long-term training courses
culminating in the award of formal qualifications. This was felt to be inappropriate as it did not respond to
the urgent need to improve the skills and effectiveness of civil servants in the key economic ministries.
Hence short term, job-specific training courses were substituted for the CEPAG capacity building
component in order to achieve a wider and quicker impact. For reasons of consistency, the development
objectives of establishing a permanent gouvernment capability to train its staff should have been dropped at
this stage. The second significant modification to the original project design was the inclusion of the main
sectoral ministries responsible for implementing the bulk of the PIP. It was correctly felt that the desired
improvements in the preparation and management of the PIP could not be achieved by limiting the project's
interventions to the Ministry of Plan. Consequently, reinforcement of the planning directorates of six
sectoral ministries were also included in the scope of the restructured project.
The overall project cost was reduced to US$ 10 million to take account of the decision of ACBF to
independently finance a separate project instead of providing cofinancing. Due to the substantial reduction
in the volume of TA, the withdrawal of ACBF did not necessitate a reduction in the scope of activities
under this project.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
The project suffered from a poor initial design that placed excessive emphasis on long-termn resident
expatriate technical assistance. Initially 80% of the project funds were allocated to cover the costs of a
massive deployment (24 staff years) of technical advisors. The GOB reservations about this feature of the
project were not taken in to account during preparation and appraisal. The Credit was negotiated despite
GOB's concerns, which were recorded in the Minutes of Negotiations. With hindsight it is apparent that
the Bank should have been more sensitive to GOB's concerns. The project did not have stakeholder
support and should have been reappraised before Board approval. Ratification of the DCA by the
Parliament was difficult because of similar criticisms from Deputies. As a result it became necessary to
restructure the project and redefine the role of TA even before implementation began. For these reasons the
ICR assesses the project's quality at entry to have been unsatisfactory.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4. 1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Globally the Project has substantially met its objectives by contributing to improved economic
management by GOB. The overall performance of the national economy has been raised, with notably the
real GDP growth that has been consistently above 4% annually. Both the fiscal and external accounts have
shown dramatic improvements. Also, the Project has financed crucial studies to introduce fundamental
reforms to the public administrative including the drafting and scaling up of a new Procurement Code. In
addition to that, it contributed to higher productivity within its key ministries. The project enhanced the
technical capacity of planning units in sectoral ministries, and assisted in the preparation and monitoring of
the Budget by the Treasury and Budget departments of the MOF. The project equipped many government
departments with modem office equipment for the first time and provided extensive staff training. It
funded important preparatory studies for civil service reform and has been of valuable assistance to GOB
in implementing the conditionalities of SAL III and ESAF II. The project can be credited with having made
a valuable contribution to Benin's improved macroeconomic performance during the 2nd half of the 1990's.
The overall project outcome is therefore considered to be satisfactory, depite the shortcomings discussed in
para. 4.2.3
The project did not have any environmental, poverty alleviation or gender objectives
Inter alia, over 200 PCs were procured under the project, along with printers, servers, and various reprographic equipment.
Full details of equipment procured under the project can be found in the long version of the GOB completion report "Rapport
d'Achevement du Projet d'Appui a la Gestion de l'Economie" (archived)
4.2 Outputs by components:
4.2.1. Technical and logistical support to the Budget Directorate and to the Treasury (by training, technical
assistance, studies tours, audit, equipment and computerizsation) has improved their financial programming
and fund disbursements process. The Project has directly enabled the constitution of a single, integrated
civil service staff list and the regular and prompt payment of salaries which was virtually unknown in the
past. It has also equiped and modernized the Treasury department in such way that it produces timely
required data for its own management purposes and to respond to donors needs as well. Assistance from the
project to agencies controlling and auditing public expenditures now enables the GOB to undertake ex-post
reviews of the execution of the annual budget, which was formerly not done and to introduce more
transparency in public sector mangement. A project-funded study led to a reorganization of the role and
improved performance of the CAA. New public procurement procedures and manuals were prepared under
the project and have been introduced. For the first time Benin now has a uniform public procurement code.
4.2.2. INSAE's stock of computers has been extensively modernized and the provision of various
reprographic equipment has enabled it to publish economic statistics on a more timely basis as well as
reprint earlier publications that had become unobtainable. Both existing higher level as well as
newly-recruited, entry-level staff were trained under the project, thereby helping to alleviate the shortage of
statistical staff. A study to harmonize the use of statistical concepts and methods was also carried out and
its recommendations are being implemented under the supervision of the National Statistical Commission.

4.2.3. The MOP is now able to undertake its own macroeconomic modeling and can rapidly cany out
macroeconomic impact analyses (Such as the impact of external shocks like the recent increase in world oil
prices). The logistical support' and training provided to the project planning directorates in the six key
sectoral ministries (accounting for about 80% of the PIP) has improved the process of selection,
preparation and monitoring of the PIP. Despite this, the impact of the project on the execution of the PIP
has been less significant than expected, since only 73% of the 1999 PIP was implemented in financial
terms. The sectoral ministries have been slow to use the multi-criteria project selection software and have
difficulty in arbitrating between competing projects. Projects contained in the PIP are still not always fully
consistent with sectoral development strategies. Finally, the data base network linking the sectoral
ministries to MOP is not yet operational due to a lack of high-volume data transfer lines (para 5.2). This is
the only unfinished project component.
4.2.4. The support of the project to civil service reform (in the form of studies of salary and grade scales
and the introduction of merit-based pay) has been valuable, but their introduction has not yet been
completed due to the time required to achieve socio-political consensus among the concerned parties. The
project also provided some assistance with office equipment to the Management of the Archives, Disputes
and Disciplinary Affaires, Official Gazette, and the GOB Accounting body on the grounds of promoting
transparency, accountability and good governance.

4.3 Net Present Yalue/Economic rate of return.
Given its nature as a technical assistance and capacity building project, no economic or financial analysis
of the project was undertaken at appraisal.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
idem
4.5 Institutional development impact:
Nearly 700 civil servants benefited from various short and medium term, on the job training courses in
economics, finance, statistics, national accounting, and computing. Almost half of those trained were from
the MOF. Overall, 44 in house training modules corresponding to 427 days of training and 32 overseas
training modules corresponding to 967 days of training have been organized under the Project funding. In
conjunction with the improved access to modem office equipment, this assistance from the project enhanced
the productivity of key GOB ministries. Nevertheless, the impact of the project on GOB's overall
institutional capabilities is assessed to be modest because of its small size and the difficulty in retaining the
acquired skills due to high levels of staff rotation.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency.
Several significant external factors outside the control of the Government or the implementing agency
affected project implementation:
*   Project implementation was seriously delayed due to the initial unwillingness of the Bank to take into
account the GOB point of view on the excessive role of TA and the subsequent need to restructure the
project (para 3.5).
-5 -



* The withdrawal of ACBF as a cofinancier and criticisms of the original project design from the
National Assembly also had to be taken in to consideration in the revise project design. Consequently,
project implementation did not begin till mid- 1996, four years after the original appraisal.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The project was also adversely affected by the following:
* The project suffered from delays in decision-making after each new Ministerial nomination of senior
MOP officials. However, this may have been unavoidable given that the new officials needed to
familiarize themselves with the issues and the project prior to taking decisions.
* Delays in releasing counterpart funds also had an adverse impact on the pace of implementation during
the last year of the project. This was due to unexpectedly high expenditures during the closing phase of
the project, for which the GOB contribution had been under-budgeted.
*   The two project management/steering committees designed to guide and supervise the work of the PIU
never became operational, possibly due to lack of motivation or incentives on the part of those
appointed to these committees.
* There was insufficient take-up of the project funds by some of the beneficiary agencies, despite urging
from the PIU. Several entities did not take full advantage of the funds made available by the project,
possibly due to the failure of the steering committees to operate. Greater support from GOB in this
area would have been useful and would have helped to reduce the large undisbursed Credit balance at
the end of the project (para 5.4.2).
a High levels of transfers of staff who benefited from the training courses offered under the project led to
a short-term loss of expertise and undermined the sustainability of the institutional development impact
of the project. High staff mobility appears to be a generalized problem throughout the civil service.
• Delays in implementing the recommendations of some important studies supported by the project to
improve the efficiency of public finance and administration.
5. 3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
* In the closing stages of the project, the PIU was slow to anticipate and correct the difficulties in
bringing into service the data exchange network between ministries arising from the inability of the
telecommunications company to provide high-volume data links. Consequently, the inter-ministerial
data transfer network was not operational at the time of project closure. However, steps have been
taken to ensure that it is in service by early 2001 (para 6.2).
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
5.4.1 The total project cost including contingencies, at appraisal was US$12 million equivalent; of which
the foreign exchange component was about 87%. During restructuring, the project cost was reduced to
US$10 million. By the Closing Date, the actual cost was estimated at US$7.3 million, which is expected to
rise to about US$7.5 million upon completion of the remaining works. The significant cost savings are
principally the result of reduced expenditures on consulting services, in part due to a greater usage of local
consultants.
5.4.2  Total project financing by IDA was SDR 2.06 million (about US$2.85 million equivalent) at the
-6-



Closing Date, only about 55% of the available funds. The under-utilization of IDA funds was due to the
reduced effective length of project implementation following its restructuring (three instead of four and a
half years). DANIDA financing of US$ 3.6 million was equivalent to 90% of the available grant.
Understandably, GOB attempted to maximize the use of these grant funds. Funding by GOB at the time of
ICR preparation was US$0.8 million, equal to its estimated contribution at the time of project
restructuring, but this is expected to rise to US$1million upon full project completion.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The project had a varying impact on the nine ministries and three agencies attached to the Presidency,
which makes it difficult to reach a single summary rating. In general terms, the high degree of staff
transfers within GOB makes benefits from training activities hard to retain within the targeted directorate.
In addition, sustaining the productivity improvements resulting from the provision of computers and other
office equipment depends upon the beneficiaries making adequate budgetary arrangements to meet the
resulting recurrent cost in future years. This remains to be demonstrated, but the improving GOB
budgetary position means that resource constraints are less severe than in the past. In the judgement of this
ICR, the impact of the project on its three largest beneficiaries, MOP, MOF and INSEA, is likely to be
sustained. For this reason, the overall sustainability of the project is assessed as likely.
6 2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Given the fact that GOB has decided to embark on a far-reaching of its budget management through the
preparation of a public expenditure reform credit (PERC) the management of public expenditures will
change accordingly. In this context, the MOP has informed all the project beneficiaries to ensure that their
future operating budgets make adequate provision for recurrent costs linked to equipment supplied under
the project (maintenance and office supplies etc). Within the context of the PERC, responsibilities of the
line ministries for the preparation and execution of their budgets will be increased and program-based
budgeting within a multi-year budget framework will be established starting in 2001. This will increase the
prospects for project sustainability by reducing the reliance of the ministrie on donor-funded projects to
meet recurrent costs.
In order to ensure that the investments made under the project are effectively used in the future the PIU is
making arrangements to install high-speed data transfer links between Ministries. This will enable the
rapid and timely exchange of information between the sectoral ministries and the MOP on the PIP. Training
in Oracle database software, which has been postponed pending the installation of the data transfer links
between ministries is also planned. The MoF has confirmed that funds will be provided from the ongoing
budget to meet the initial interconnection costs. It is expected that the inter-ministerial network will be
operational in early 2001.
Finally, it is apparent that the high degree of staff transfers within GOB means that the type of training
undertaken by the project should become a permanent feature of the civil service human resource
development and capacity building programs. Unmet training needs, particularly at lower and middle levels
of the civil service, (which were not addressed by this project), are enormous.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
The project's objectives were appropriate. However, the shortcomings in project design (para 3.5) and
- 7 -



appraisal lead this ICR to conclude that Bank performance during preparation and appraisal was
unsatisfactory. The project should have been reappraised before Board presentation, which took place 16
months after appraisal. Credit effectiveness then took a further 14 months to accomplish, during which
time the Bank also appears to have been unreceptive to GOB's concerns about the project design. No
supervision missions appear to have taken place during this period.
7.2 Supervision:
Following a change in management responsible for Benin, the Bank responded promptly to the GOB
request to restructure the project and performance thereafter improved significantly. Substantial staff
resources were deployed to the restructuring and intensive supervision efforts (three missions in under a
year) undertaken. Overall project supervision by the Bank was satisfactory, with nine missions in the five
years between effectiveness and closure. A mid-term review was carried out about two years after the
formal launch of the restructured project. The project also benefited from a fairly high degree of continuity
in Bank staff who worked on the project since its restructuring. The decision to transfer responsibility for
task management to the Field Office also improved the quality of supervision, particularly as regards
procurement and financial matters.
7.3 Overall Bank performance.
Taking into account all of the above, the Bank's overall performance is assessed to have been satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
GOB's performance is assessed as unsatisfactory because (a) it should have played a more active part in
project preparation and appraisal so as to ensure that the project was appropriate to its needs; (b) it should
not have negotiated and agreed to undertake a project that it did not consider to be appropriate.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
GOB did not provide adequate leadership or guidance to the PIU via the oversight committees or make
adequate efforts to ensure greater utilization of the available project funds. Consequently, almost half the
IDA Credit amount will be canceled. Overall GOB performance is assessed as unsatisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The project benefited from a committed and dedicated PIU. Despite its small size and cramped office
space, the PIU's performance in implementation of the project was highly satisfactory. Financial records
were well kept and project accounts were audited within the prescribed period. No anomalies were reported
by the auditors. Implementation progress reports were submitted regularly and promptly. No procurement
problems occurred.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Nevertheless, the overall performance of the Borrower is assessed as satisfactory because the shortcomings
in GOB's performance are outweighed by the highly satisfactory performance of the PIU.
8. Lessons Learned
The key lessons that can be drawn from this project are:
*   Project 'ownership' by stakeholders is crucial for successful project outcomes;
*   An effective steering committee in charge of guiding and coordinating the multiple interventions of
capacity building projects is crucial to their success. The existence of a PIU alone does not guarantee

the full implication of the beneficiaries.
*   Conditions for Credit effectiveness should be kept to a minimum to avoid creating implementation
delays right from the start of a project;
*   Capacity building through training has to be made a permanent, ongoing activity if the benefits are to
be sustained, particularly in an environment of frequent staff transfers;
*   The sustainability of institutional development projects substantially depends upon the availability of
budgetary funds to meet recurrent costs such as utility bills, office supplies and equipment repair and
maintenance.
*   Small TA projects are costly to undertake in comparison with total disbursements. Over the life of the
project IDA spent nearly $0.5 million to disburse a total of US$ 6.5 million (including the DANIDA
funds administered by IDA)

RESUME DU RAPPORT D'EVALUATION ET D'ACHEVEMENT DU PROJET D'APPUI A LA
GESTION DE L'ECONOMIE
(Credit IDA 2552-BEN)
I - DESCRIPTION ET DEMARRAGE DU PROJET
1.1. Historique
Le Projet d'Appui A la Gestion de l'Economie (PAGE) a ete concu pour ameliorer les capacites de gestion
economique et financiere du Benin. II vise A renforcer la preparation et la gestion du Programme d'
Investissements Publics (PIP), du budget, et A ameliorer la qualite des comptes nationaux.
En effet, le projet a ete mis en place, pour apporter une reponse aux dysfonctionnements releves sur le plan
de la gestion de 1'6conomie. Depuis la premiere mission d'evaluation du projet en juin- juillet 1992, sa mise
en oeuvre est passee par plusieurs etapes, aboutissant A une meilleure ad6quation entre le projet et ses
objectifs. En septembre 1993 le contenu du projet a fait l'objet de negociations A Washington au cours
desquelles, le gouvemement a demande: que le domaine d'intervention du PAGE ne soit pas circonscrit
aux seuls ministeres economiques (Ministere des Finances et Ministere charge du Plan) mais etendu
egalement aux Ministeres sectoriels, gros consommateurs du programme d'investissements publics et les
actions de longue periode initialement prevues, tant en ce qui conceme l'assistance technique que la
formation, soient reduites au profit d'interventions de courte duree. II a ete alors convenu que le contenu du
projet fera ulterieurement l'objet d'un recentrage complet;
-     entre avril et d6cembre 1993, les etudes de reorganisation du Ministere charge du Plan et de la
CAA ont ete effectuees. La mise en aeuvre des recommandations issues de ces etudes a eu pour
principal resultat, en ce qui conceme le Ministere charge du Plan, I'amelioration et la dynamisation
des procedures d'e1aboration du PIP, et quant A la CAA, la contribution A une meilleure gestion de
la dette publique;
-     en octobre 1993 et en mai 1994 sont intervenus respectivement, le M6morandum et la signature de
I'Accord de credit, documents etablis sur la base de la premiere formulation du projet;
-     en juillet 1994, I'African Capacity Building Fundation (ACBF), I'un des co-financiers, s'est retire
du financement du PAGE reduisant ainsi le cout du projet de douze A dix millions de dollars US;
-     le 28 decembre 1994, le decret portant ratification du projet a ete publie;
-     le 31 janvier 1995, le projet est entr6 en vigueur.
Suite A ces negociations et la ratification de l'accord de credit en mai 1994, la reformulation du projet s'6tait
averee necessaire aussi bien pour prendre en compte les recommandations de l'Assemblee Nationale du
Benin au cours de l'examen de l'accord de Cr6dit que pour recentrer les orientations du projet et proceder A
la reallocation des coats aux differentes rubriques du projet apres le retrait de I'ACBF du financement de ce
demier.
Ce recentrage a ete entrepris avec l'appui de deux missions conjointes Banque Mondiale /DANIDA en

1995 A l'issue desquelles les principales actions pr6paratoires suivantes ont e  retenues:
-      etude des besoins de formation et preparation d'un premier plan annuel de formation des cadres des
Ministeres charges du Plan et des Finances ainsi que des principaux Ministeres sectoriels
intervenant "massivement" dans le PIP, c'est A dire les Ministeres du developpement Rural, des
Travaux Publics et des Transports, de l'Environnement de I'Habitat et de l'Urbanisme, des Mines,
de l'Energie et de l'Hydraulique, de l'Education Nationale et de la Recherche Scientifique, et de la
Sante Publique.
etude-diagnostic des forces et faiblesses de la chaine Planification-Programmation
Budgetisation-Execution et Suivi des projets d'investissements publics;
audit des moyens informatiques disponibles dans les structures ministerielles appuyees par le
PAGE.
Simultanement, les structures appuyees par le PAGE ont e  invitees A faire etat de leurs besoins
previsionnels afin de definir plus precisement les orientations A prendre et les moyens A mettre en aeuvre
pour la bonne execution du projet.
Les differentes actions sus evoquees du recentrage du PAGE ont conduit au report de la date de demarrage
effectif du projet, initialement fixee au 31 janvier 1995. En outre, lesdites conclusions ont permis de
reformuler le projet dans ses composantes, ses categories et cofits. L'organisation de l'atelier de lancement
des activites du PAGE en juin 1996 marqua la fin du processus de la restructuration du projet.
1.2. Objectifs du projet
Le PAGE a e  concu pour ameliorer et renforcer la capacite de gestion economique et financiere du Benin.
A cet egard, il vise A: i) renforcer la preparation et la gestion du PIP, du budget, et A ameliorer la qualite
des comptes nationaux ; ii) renforcer la capacite des agents de la fonction publique dans le domaine de la
gestion de l'economie et des finances et A fournir au gouvemement la capacite de former son personnel pour
un meilleur fonctionnement de son administration; iii) appuyer le programme de reformes economiques du
gouvemement.
Le Projet d'Appui A la Gestion de l'Economie est articule autour de quatre volets que sont: it formation;
iitappui au Ministere charge du Plan, iiit appui au Ministere des Finances et iv/appui aux Ministeres
sectoriels.
Ce volet vise au renforcement des capacites des secteurs par l'amelioration des performances et de la
qualite du travail. Toutefois, par ce volet, le projet a apporte son appui A la reforme administrative, aux
corps de contr6le de l'Etat; au Ministere de la Justice et A la Presidence de la Republique.

II - CONCEPTION, EXECUTION, REALISATION ET IMPACT DU PROJET
2.1. Evaluation de la conception du projet (Conferer lPhistorique du projet)
2.2. Coordination et gestion du projet
La coordination et la gestion des activites du projet sont assurees par une Cellule denommee Coordination
Nationale du Projet (CN/PAGE), elle- meme placee sous la tutelle de la Direction Nationale du Plan et de
la Prospective (DNPP).
La cellule de coordination du projet est animee par une equipe restreinte composee de cinq cadres
superieurs, d'un cadre moyen renforcee par un personnel d'appui fort de cinq agents d'execution. Toutefois,
l'equipe a pu beneficier d'une memoire institutionnelle qui est l'une des raisons de son efficacite. En effet,
c'est la cellule de gestion du Projet du Pre-Investissement (PPI), objet du credit IDA 2286-BEN, qui, en
raison du lien de complementarite existant entre ce demier et le PAGE, a assure le travail d'appui A la mise
en place du PAGE. Le projet est dote de deux comites de gestion A savoir : le Comite de Coordination
Pedagogique (CCP) et le Comite Technique de Coordination (CTC). Ils ont ete crees en juin 1998.
Le Comite de Coordination Pedagogique est, entre autres, charge de:
-      veiller A l'adequation des besoins de formation des structures impliquees dans la gestion de
l1'conomie et des enseignements dispenses par les centres de formation selectionnes dans le cadre
du projet;
-      suivre le processus de formation en cours d'emploi du projet et le transfert d'expertise des centres
de formation etrangers selectionnes aux cadres nationaux .
En ce qui concerne le Comite Technique de Coordination du projet, il est entre autres, charge, de:
-     suivre la mise en aeuvre des nouveaux systemes et procedures de gestion de l'conomie mis en place
dans le cadre du projet;
*     examiner les modalites de reorientation a proposer A la Banque Mondiale en cas d'evolution de la
situation economique nationale.
- Relations entre le Coordonnateur du projet et les decideurs politiques
Le Coordonnateur rend compte trimestriellement par des rapports d'activites qu'il adresse aux autorites
competentes du Ministere d'Etat Charge du Plan (Directeur National du Plan et de la Prospective, Directeur
de la Programmation et de la Prospective).
- Relations entre le Coordonnateur du projet et les directeurs techniques
ll s'agit des relations de coordination et de suivi des activites financdes par le projet dans le cadre du
renforcement et de la modemrisation des structures techniques appuyees par le PAGE. Ces relations ont et
formalisees A travers la creation des organes de gestion du projet supra indiques au sein desquels siegent les
premiers responsables ou representants des structures techniques cardinales de la chaine PPBS. Le detail
des missions desdits comites sont contenus dans les arret6s ci-joints qui les ont crees.
- Lecons a tirer:
* dotation de l'Administration d'outils modernes d'analyse macro-economique et sectorielle;
* mise en reseau sans exclusive de tous les maillons de la Chaine
Planification-Programmation-Budgetisation et Suivi en vue de la circulation de l'information;
*   renforcement des capacites et des competences de l'Administration par des formations lides aux
- 12-



fonctions exercees;
* modemisation de l'Administration par la mise en place du materiel informatique, de nouveaux outils de
gestion et autres logistiques de travail;
* non demultiplication des formations re,ues au niveau institutionnel;
* grande rnobilite des cadres dans I'Administration, ce qui constitue un handicap serieux a la
perennisation des acquis du projet;
2.3. Impact du projet dans la mise en euvre de la politique nationale de gestion economique et
financiere
* amelioration et informatisation de la chaine solde;
* disponibilite de capacite et de compdtence pour I'l1aboration du budget economique de I'Etat;
* disponibilite de capacite et de competence pour realiser des activites d'analyse macro-
* economique A la Direction Nationale du Plan et de la Prospective (DNPP);
* meilleure selection des projets inscrits au PIP
* en adequation avec les strategies sectorielles grfce A la mise en place d'un systeme
*   infornatise d'analyse multicritere;
* disponibilite de capacite et de competence pour 1l'eaboration de la loi de reglement;
* arnmlioration de la reforme administrative.
III - Analyse critique de I'action de la Banque Mondiale du Gouvernement et de l'Assistance
Technique
3.1. - Appreciation de l'action de la Banque Mondiale au cours de l'execution du projet
- Principales decisions ayant favorise 1'execution du projet
Mis en vigueur en janvier 1995, le Projet devait s'achever le 31 decembre 1998. A la faveur de la revue A
mi-parcours de mai 1998 et sur la base du Plan d'Actions adopte par les beneficiaires au cours de l'atelier
en mai 1998 qui a sanctionne les travaux de la mission conjointe DANIDA-Banque Mondiale de
supervision et de revue dudit projet, la Banque Mondiale a decide de proroger la date de cl6ture du credit
d'un an, reportant ainsi la date d'achevement du projet au 31 decembre 1999. Mais courant octobre 1999,
if s'est av&e  que d'importantes activites inscrites au plan d'actions etaient en cours d'execution et ne
pouvaient pas prendre fin avant le 31 decembre 1999. Face A cette situation, la Banque Mondiale accorda
A titre exceptionnel une extension de trois mois de la date de cl6ture pour certaines categories du Credit
IDA et du Don DANIDA.
Le plan d'actions issu de la revue a mi-parcours de mai 1998 a dte traduit sur recommandation du charge
du projet, en budget - programme pour faciliter son execution A la Coordination Nationale du PAGE. En
effet, avec le Budget -Programme, la coordination du PAGE et le charge du projet se sont convenus sur les
activites a realiser et les montants previsionnels y relatifs. Cette entente salutaire a soustrait la coordination
de la delivrance des avis de non objection A ltexception des montants pour lesquels l'avis de non objection
est obligatoirement requis et du delai relativement long que cet acte pourrait mettre pour etre emis.
Enfin, au nombre des actions entreprises par la Banque Mondiale qui ont favorisd l'execution du projet, il
importe de citer l'ouverture que l'IDA a faite en acceptant que le PAGE intervienne dans des domaines
autres que ceux definis dans l'annexe technique n°l A l'accord de Credit IDA tels que le contr6le de
l'ex6cution du budget en apportant un appui aux Corps de Contr6le de l'Etat qui n'avaient pas et impliques
dans la chaine PPBS (IGF, Chambre de Comptes de la Cour Supreme et Controle Financier) et la reforme
- 13 -



administrative (Fichier Unique de Reference, cadrage de la reforme administrative et nouveau systeme de
carriere et de remuneration dans la fonction publique).
- Principales decisions ayant freine l'execution du projet
Dans le cadre de la ratification de l'accord de credit du PAGE, I'Assemblee Nationale a fait un certain
nombre de recommandations dont les principales sont: i) reduire l'assistance technique de longue duree a
une assistance technique de courte duree; ii) prevoir une forte utilisation des cabinets et experts nationaux
dans les activites de consultations; iii) interesser les centres de formations nationales aux activites de
formation.
Au regard de ces recommandations et suite au retrait de l'un des co-financiers, I'ACBF du financement du
PAGE, la reformulation de ce dernier a et rendu necessaire en vue de recentrer les activites et de
reconsiderer le cofit global par categorie et par nature. Dans le cadre de la reformulation du projet, le
gouvernement beninois a decide de commun accord avec la Banque Mondiale de faire realiser les trois
etudes ci-apres dont les resultats conditionnaient le demarrage effectif des activites dudit Projet. II s'agit de:
i) evaluation de la chaine PPBS des projets inscrits au Programme d'Investissements Publics ; iii) audit des
moyens informatiques de la chaine PPBS; ii) evaluation des besoins en formations et plan annuel de
formation des cadres "A" de la Chaine PPBS.
Prevues pour durer trois mois, ces trois etudes ont ete r6alisees sur une periode de 15 mois, ce qui a conduit
au lancement officiel des activites du projet le 13 juin 1996. Par rapport a la date de mise en vigueur du
projet, pres de 15 mois se sont donc ecoules sans que le projet n'ait demarre en realite, etant donne que ces
etudes sont financees sur le PPF. En principe, l'IDA ne devait pas comptabiliser le temps mis pour r6aliser
ces etudes dans la vie du projet bien qu'elles soient utiles pour clarifier un certain nombre de ses aspects.
De meme, le champ d'execution de l'une des quatre composantes du projet, en l'occurrence "I'Appui aux
reformes economiques" a ete restreint. En effet, alors qu'il etait prevu a travers cette composante d'apporter
un appui aux domaines ci-apres: i) codification des textes juridiques, etudes en vue d'une reforme judiciaire
et plan d'action correspondants; (ii) etudes en vue d'une reforme du systeme bancaire et plan d'action pour
ameliorer l'intermediation financiere; (iii) plan d'action pour l'execution des recommandations d'une etude
de la competitivitd et le suivi des indicateurs de competitivite et (iv) plan d'action pour le suivi de
l'execution de la reforme des tarifs douaniers. Le concours du PAGE au profit du Ministere charge de la
Justice et des Droits de l'Homme dans le cadre de cette composante s'est limite a l'acquisition d'equipements
informatiques et accessoires et a un appui logistique dans le cadre des journmes de reflexion sur l'image que
l'opinion nationale a des officiers des services judiciaires.
- Suivi du projet par la Banque Mondiale
Au cours de l'execution du PAGE, la coordination nationale a connu trois charges de projets. Les
changements de charges de projet denotent de la complexite de gestion d'un projet de renforcement
institutionnel. Cependant, loin de causer des prejudices a 1'execution du projet, ces changements ont ete bien
assumes grace A la sauvegarde de la memoire et A la conservation des archives du projet.
- 14 -



- Lecons a tirer
Au regard de tout ce qui precede et notamment en ce qui conceme les freins A 1'execution du projet, il
importe A I'avenir: i) de veiller au reglement de tous les problemes susceptibles d'entraver le demarrage du
projet avant la signature de l'accord de credit et des documents annexes; ii) d'adopter ddsormais I'approche
budget-programme dans la mise en ceuvre des projets, afin qu'une fois que le consensus est obtenu entre la
cellule de gestion et le charge de projet sur ce budget programme, son execution se fasse sans attendre un
quelconque avis de la Banque. Toutefois, I'avis de cette institution ne sera requis que s'il se pose des
problmes dont la resolution implique les deux parties (Administration et partenaire au developpement).
3.2. - Appreciation de l'action du gouvernement au cours de l'execution du projet.
- Principales decisions ayant favorise 1'execution du projet
Suivant l'Accord de Credit, le gouvemement a veil1l a: i) la mise A disposition du projet du personnel cinq
cadres superieurs, un cadre moyen, cinq agents d'appui) pour animer la cellule de gestion du projet, des
locaux pour abriter ses services et les fonds de contrepartie; ii) la creation et l'installation de la cellule de
coordination du projet dans des locaux amenages pour la circonstance;iii) la creation et l'installation des
comites technique et pedagogique du projet.
Dans le cadre de la recherche des solutions aux differents problemes rencontres dans la gestion des projets,
notamnment ceux relatifs A la passation des marches publics, le gouvemement a pris de decisions
importantes visant au relevement du seuil des marches publics qui doivent etre soumis A I'approbation du
Ministre des Finances et de l'Economie et la mise en place des regies d'avance. De meme, le dMlai d'
approbation des marches et /ou des contrats par le Ministre des Finances et de l'Economie a ete
sensiblement reduit et le principe de report de credit a ete adoptd en attendant la mise en place des premiers
fonds de contrepartie en debut de chaque exercice budgetaire.
- Principales decisions ayant freine l'execution du projet
Dans le souci de creer un cadre adequat de travail A la coordination nationale du PAGE, il a ete
initialement convenu de faire financer sur le Don DANIDA lie au credit IDA, la construction au
rez-de-chauss6e du Batiment de l'INSAE, des bureaux et une salle de reunion. Mais A l'achevement des
travaux, la coordination nationale du PAGE n'a pu en beneficier parce que sur les douze bureaux
construits dans ce cadre, seulement trois lui ont ete affectes alors qu'il en occupait dejA dans ses locaux
actuels cinq. L'Administration ayant decidd d'affecter les bureaux sont plut6t affectes A d'autres struture.
C'est le lieu de reconnaitre que cette decision a ete pr6judiciable pour la coordination du PAGE, car avec
lPvolution des activites et du personnel, les locaux etaient devenus tres etroits.
La coordination nationale a organise plusieurs activites de formation qualifiante au profit des structures
beneficiaires du PAGE. II est regrettable de constater queen raison des frequentes nominations ou
affectations A des postes de responsabilites qui dans la plupart des cas n'ont rien A voir avec les formations
recues, le taux de mobilite des cadres qui ont profite de ces formations est tres eleve.
- Difficultes de tresorerie et de contrepartie du Gouvernement
Bien que des efforts aient dtd faits par l'Administration des Finances en matiere de creation des regies
d'avance et du relevement du seuil des march6s publics A soumettre A l'a approbation du Ministre des
- 15 -



Finances et de l'Economie, des problemes persistent. II s'agit notamment de la non disponibilite des fonds
de contrepartie au cours du premier trimestre de l'annee fiscale et de la lenteur dans la mise A disposition
desdits fonds.
Suivi du projet au niveau du Ministere charge du Plan
Les rapports trimestriels et annuels sont r6gulierement elabores par la coordination nationale du PAGE.
Des exemplaires sont aussit6t transmis A la Banque Mondiale et aux autorites superieures hierarchiques du
Ministere.
Les comites pedagogique et technique de coordination du projet ont ete crees et installes, mais ils ont et
peu fonctionnels en matiere de suivi des activit6s du projet. En effet, la cellule n'a pu beneficier
veritablement de l'impulsion et du soutien que les principales directions techniques de la chaine PPBS
devaient lui apporter notamment dans la conception et l'execution des taches afferentes aux activites de
preparation, d'execution et du suivi du budget.
- Changement de gouvernement et consequences sur le suivi du projet
Depuis la date de mise en vigueur du projetjusqu'A cejour, la Republique du Benin a connu plusieurs
gouvernements dont trois ont conduit au changement des Ministres charges du Plan. II a ete constate que
ces mutations ont pour consequence d'accentuer la lenteur dans la prise de decision. En effet, la nouvelle
equipe veut legitimement etre mieux renseignee sur les activites du projet et les procedures de son
execution. Par consequent, on note un peu comme une prudence excessive de sa part et les sollicitations en
vue de la comprehension et de la mise A niveau en infornations relatives a la vie du projet sont nombreuses,
ce qui freine le rythme de travail de l'equipe de gestion du projet.
- Principales le,ons a tirer
* I'evaluation des capacites du moment et l'adoption d'une approche qui garantit l'adhesion totale des
beneficiaires devront etre les conditions prealables A la formulation d'un projet d'appui institutionnel
*   le gouvemement doit faire un effort pour maintenir en place pendant une periode raisonnable A definir
par la suite, les cadres de la chame PPBS qui beneficient des formations de courte ou de longue dur6e
afin de leur permettre de capitaliser les acquis dans leur milieu de travail;
*   A I'avenir, on devra veiller A rendre plus operationnels les diff6rents comites techniques de gestion des
projets;
*   le Ministre des Finances et de l'Economie devra mettre en place A l'image des regies d'avance, un
systeme d'avance de tresorerie des le premier mois apres le vote du budget au profit de tous les projets
inscrits au PIP
3.3. - Evaluation de l'efficacite et de la qualite des relations entre la Banque Mondiale et le
Gouvernement durant 1'execution du projet
D'une fa,on generale, les relations de travail entre la Banque Mondiale et le Gouvemement sont bonnes,
car elles ont permis d'apporter des solutions adequates aux problemes auxquels a ete confront6e la
coordination nationale lors de 1'execution du projet.
Toutefois, certaines decisions de la Banque Mondiale dont les suivantes ont defavorise le projet. En effet,
alors que les travaux relatifs aux etudes ci-apres etaient tres avances, I'IDA a decide de suspendre leur
execution pour des raisons qui ne sont pas justifiees. II s'agit de l'elaboration de la charte de la
- 16 -



fonctionnelle de la chaine PPBS et de la rationalisation de l'organisation administrative et de l'emploi qui
auraient pu etre realisees etant donne que les dysfonctionnements a corriger par la realisation de ces etudes
persistent encore.
3.4. - Evaluation des performances des differentes institutions, bureaux d'etudes et consultants ayant
participe a la realisation du projet
*   Ia plupart des structures techniques de la chaine PPBS n'ont pas saisi l'opportunite offerte par le
projet pour renforcer leur capacite et par consequent leur efficacit6 et performance.
* les bureaux d'etudes consultes et les foumisseurs sollicites ont ete globalemnent A la hauteur de leur
mission et ont donne satisfaction. Toutefois, il y a eu un foumisseur ind6licat qui n'a pas pu respecter
les engagements contractuels pris dans le cadre d'un marche
IV - EVALUATION ECONOMIQUE ET FINACIERE DU PROJET
4.1. - Cofit total du Projet
4.1.1. - Prevision de depart et cofit reel des diffirentes composantes du projet
Le co6t total du projet est, suivant I'accord de credit initial du 06 mai 1994, de douze millions de dollars
US reparti comme ci-apres:
IDA (Prt)      : 5,2 millions de $ US soit 43% du cofit total;
DANIDA (Don) 4  millions de $ US    33%;
ACBF (Don)   :2  millions de $ US    17%;
Budget National: 0,8 millions de $ US  7%
Avec le retrait de l'African Capacity Building Fundation (ACBF) et suite A la reformulation du projet, le
cout total revise du projet est, selon l'accord amende en date du 20 novembre 1996, de dix millions de
dollars US reparti comme suit:
IDA            :5,2 millions de $ US, soit 52% du cout total;
DANIDA         : 4  millions de $ US    40%;
Budget National: 0,8 millions de $ US  8%.
Par rapport A ces dernieres previsions, les realisations s'elevent respectivement A:
-      IDA: 2,90 millions de $ US soit 56% des previsions pour l'IDA et 40% du cout reel total
d'execution du projet;
-      DANIDA: 3,54 millions de $ US soit 89% des previsions pour DANIDA et 49% du coat reel total
d'execution du projet;
-      Budget National: 0,83 millions de $ US soit 104% des previsions pour le Budget national et 11%
du cout reel total d'execution du projet.
II en resulte un taux global de realisation de 72,7%. Une analyse plus fine permet de faire les observations
suivantes:
Les categories "Surcofits Operationnels", "Refinancement du PPF" et "Formation" ont atteint
respectivement des taux de 86%, 95% et 78% qui ne s'eloignent pas trop du taux global de realisation.
- 17 -



Toutefois, 1'ecart observe au niveau de la categorie "Services de Consultants" qui ne s'eleve qu'a un taux de
realisation/prevision de 48%, soit 24% de moins que le taux global d'execution du projet est compense par
l'ecart observe au niveau de la categorie "Equipements, Whicules et Fournitures" qui s'eleve quant A lui A
un taux de realisation de 141%, soit 69% de plus que le taux global de realisation. En effet, il etait prevu
initialement dans le tableau des coats du projet, d'acquerir une soixantaine de micro-ordinateurs et
accessoires au profit des structures beneficiaires du PAGE. A 1'execution, il s'est avdre ndcessaire de mettre
en rdseau informatique la chaine PPBS en vue de la circulation de l'information et d'accelerer la procedure
de preparation et du suivi du budget de l'Etat. Ce qui a abouti A l'acquisition de 208 micro-ordinateurs, 20
serveurs et accessoires (imprimantes, onduleurs, modems etc.)
En outre, soulignons que pour accompagner les mesures entreprises par le Gouvernement dans le cadre de
la moralisation de la vie publique et de la bonne gouvemance, des equipements modemes de travail
(micro-ordinateurs et accessoires et materiels de reprographie) ont et acquis au profit des corps de controle
de l'Etat (IGF, CF et CC) pour renforcer leur capacite d'intervention.
Au niveau de la passation des marches, on constate que tant pour l'IDA que pour les autres bailleurs les
marches ont ete attribues selon les principes et regles de l'IDA. En effet, les foumisseurs etrangers ont
obtenu 56% des marches passes contre une prevision de 52%.
Le Gouvemement a mis a la disposition du Projet 0,83 million de dollars US contre 0,80 million de dollars
US prevu, soit un niveau de realisation de 104%. Ceci s'explique par le fait que le Benin doit financer A
hauteur de 10% toutes les acquisitions de biens effectuees par le Projet et la Taxe sur la Valeur Ajoutee de
ces 10%.
4.2. - Couit recurrent engendre par le Projet
Le Projet d'Appui A la Gestion de l'Economie a mis en place un systeme moderne d'information qui
engendrerait des couts recurrents payes d'avance par le projet pour les trois premieres annees d'utilisation
du reseau apres la date de garantie des equipements.
Dans le cadre de la mise en service du systeme d'information, le projet devra proceder A I'abonnement des
lignes specialisees de certaines structures clefs de la chaine PPBS. Le paiement des redevances de
telecommunications dans ce cadre et l'actualisation des progiciels et logiciels acquis devront etre pris en
charge par le budget de fonctionnement de chaque structure concernee.
4.3. - Consequence previsible de la fin du Projet sur les structures institutionnelles mises en place
dans le cadre du projet
Dans le cadre de l'execution du Projet d'Appui A la Gestion de l'Economie, la seule structure mise en place
est le comite PIP-TOFE qui n'a jamais ete fonctionnelle.
- Leqons a tirer
Le PAGE, A sa cl6ture a permis d'offrir des formations A plusieurs cadres de l'Administration, de doter en
equipements modemes de travail et de mettre A la mise A disposition de plusieurs structures techniques de I'
Administration des services de consultants pour des etudes ou pour I'assistance technique. La fin du projet
n'a pas permis de parachever toutes les actions initiees surtout celles de la mise en reseau.

Les enseignements a tirer de l'evaluation economique et fmancieres du projet se resument comme ci-apres:
-      avec l'adoption du budget-programme, les actions a mener ont connu une r6alisation diligente;
-      avec la decentralisation des pouvoirs au niveau de la Banque Mondiale, les services de
decaissement ont ameliore de plus en plus leurs performances;
-      avec la prise de mesures exceptionnelles, les retards observes dans la mise en place des credits en
debut d'exercice budgetaire seront attenues.
V - Perspectives pour un nouveau projet et utilite d'un nouveau projet s'il y a lieu
Le credit IDA auquel est associe le Don Danois du PAGE est cl6tur6 le 31 mars 2000, mais il ressort de
l'examnen des activites realisees et de lN valuation de leur impact sur le renforcement de la chaine PPBS
que tous les objectifs initiaux fixes ne sont pas atteints.
L'IDA a decide de commun avec le Gouvernement beninois de reverser les fonds disponibles sur le credit
dans lrenveloppe financiere destinee A couvrir les activites du PERC, un Programme d'Appui A la Reforme
Budgetaire dans lequel le gouvernement s'est engage a proceder A une reforme en profondeur de son
systeme budgetaire.
Etant donne que le PERC consiste a donner une responsabilite plus accrue aux ministeres techniques dans
la preparation et 1'execution de leur budget et transformer le systeme budgetaire actuel en
budget-programme ayant pour but d'etablir des liens logiques entre objectifs, strategies sectorielles,
activites et budget, il importe que ce nouveau programme poursuive les activites de reformes initialement
inscrites dans le plan d'actions du PAGE, insuffisamment mises en ceuvre ou qui n'ont pas pu etre realisees
en raison de la cloture du credit.
Les activites A prendre en compte dans l'ex6cution du PERC seront apprehendees A travers les volets
ci-apres:
- Programme de formation
- Appui au Ministere d'Etat charge du Plan
- Appui au Ministere charge des Finances
- Appui aux Reformes Economiques
Le gouvemement souhaiterait egalement le financement de nombre d'actions dont la mise en oeuvre n'a pu
etre achevde avant la date de cloture et dont la realisation est primordiale pour le renforcement des
capacites de l'Administration beninoise.
Il s'agit notamment de:
-      l'etude de l'impact du programme de formation du Projet d'Appui a la Gestion de l'Economie sur le
fonctionnement de la chaine PPBS et plus precisement de la tache n°4 de cette etude qui consiste en
une assistance pour la mise en ceuvre du plan de formation issu de cette etude;
-      l'audit des comptes du PAGE, exercice 2000;
-      la formation en outils et techniques informatiques des cadres des structures appuyees par le PAGE
et
-      la formation sur Oracle, Lotus Notes et UNIX en vue de rendre operationnel le reseau informatique
mis en place par le PAGE.
En effet, l'indisponibilite de ressources financieres necessaires pour assurer la formation des Informaticiens
Developpeurs et Administrateurs, les concepteurs de programme et autres utilisateurs entrave gravement le
fonctionnement du reseau informatique mis en place par le PAGE.
- 19 -



L'objectif vise est de perrnettre aux informaticiens, aux concepteurs et aux utilisateurs du reseau, de
maitriser les outils d'Administration Oracle, Lotus Note et Windows NT sur lesquels tourne le progiciel
OPX2 de gestion de la chaine PPBS.

REPUBLIQUE DU BENIN
PROJET D'APPUI A LA GESTION DE L'ECONOMIE
(PAGE, Cr. 2552-BEN)
Mission d'achevement du 20 au 28 juin 2000
Aide-memoire
Une mission de la Banque mondiale conduite par Monsieur Ousmane Diagana,
Charge du Projet et comprenant Monsieur Hugues Agossou, (Analyste financier),
Mouhamadou Drame (Economiste) et Sunil Mathrani (Economiste-consultant), a
sejourne a Cotonou du 20 au 28 juin, pour la demiere mission de supervision et de
preparation du rapport d'achevement du PAGE. La mission avait pour objectifs: (i)
d'evaluer les progres accomplis dans l'execution du Projet depuis la dernire mission
du supervision de decembre 1999 et (ii) proceder a une evaluation des realisations du
projet afin de preparer un rapport d'achevement suivant son cl6ture le 31 mars 2000.
La mission a eu l'honneur d'etre recue par leur Excellences M. Bruno Amoussou,
Ministre d'Etat charge du Plan, de la Coordination Gouvernementale, du
Developpement economique et de la promotion de l'emploi et M. Abdoulaye Bio-
Tchiane, Ministre des finances et de l'economie. De plus sous la coordination efficace
de la cellule du Projet, la mission a eu plusieurs seances de travail avec les differents
services impliques dans les activites du Projet. La mission a egalement eu une reunion
technique avec DANIDA, co-financier du Projet qui a aussi participe a la seance de
synthese. La mission tient a remercier toutes les personnes rencontrees pour leur
disponibilit6 et l'intert qu'ils accordent au Projet.
I Objectifs et contenu du Projet
De la conception initiale
Depuis sa genese en 1992, le Projet s'etait assigne comme objectifs d'appuyer le
Gouvernement en vue de:
(i) renforcer la preparation et la gestion du Programme d'investissements Publics
(PIP), du budget, et a ameliorer la qualite des comptes nationaux;
(ii) renforcer la capacite des agents de la fonction publique dans le domaine de la
gestion de l'economie et des finances et a fournir au Gouvernement la capacite de
former son personnel;
(iii) appuyer le programme des reformes economiques du gouvernement.
Suivant le design initial et en depit des reserves formulees par le Gouvernement, il a
ete considere que les objectifs sus-rappeles pourraient etre atteints par une assistance
technique exterieure et de longue dur6e. Les divergences de vue entre l'emprunteur et
la Banque par rapport a cette approche ont profondement affecte le demarrage du
Projet. En effet, le Projet a connu des retards importants des son debut - 16 mois
entre l'evaluation du PAGE en mi-1992 et son approbation par le Conseil
d'Administration de la Banque, suivi de 14 mois pour sa mise en vigueur en janvier



1995. Par la suite, avec le retrait en 1994 de l'ACBF comme l'un des cofinanciers de
depart du projet, et les critiques de la conception du projet exprimes par l'Assembl6e
nationale lors de son examen aux fins de la ratification de l'Accord de Credit, il etait
devenu necessaire et imperieux de restructurer le Projet.
De la restructuration du Projet.
Le processus de restructuration entame en Mars 1995 - deux mois apres l'entree en
vigueur- dans le cadre d'une mission conjointe de la Banque mondiale et du Royaume
du Danemark, avait considere comme principe que les objectifs initiaux du Projet
demeurent coherents et appropries dans le contexte d'un pays en ajustement
structurel. Cependant, il etait indispensable (a) de reajuster la forme, la duree et les
couits de l'assistance technique; (b) de redefinir le dispositif pour l'identification des
besoins de formation ainsi que du mecanisme qui doit permettre la mise en ceuvre de
la formation et (c) d'integrer dans le champ d'intervention du Projet les (<secteurs>> du
fait meme du role et de l'impact qu'ils ont dans la chaine de preparation, d'execution
et de suivi du budget.
II s'en suit que le volume d'assistance technique initialement prevu a ete reduit et
reoriente vers une assistance ponctuelle de courte duree. Une formation de
perfectionnement en cours d'emploi s'est substituee a une formation de longue dur6e
et diplomante, impliquant divers centres de formations avec une priorite aux locaux.
Les ministeres sectoriels ont ete pris en compte Le cofut global du projet a e  ramene
a $EU 10 million au lieu de $EU 12 million.
En definitive, 'le PAGE reformule' avait cinq volets:
F Formation
* Appui au Ministere du Plan
* Appui au Ministere des Finances
* Appui aux ministeres sectoriels
* Appui au programme des reformes macro-economiques
II Resultats enregistres
Dans 1'ensemble, le Projet a atteint ses objectifs et son execution s'est realisee de
facon satisfaisante:
(i) Renforcement de la preparation et la gestion du Programme d 'investissements
Publics (PIP), du budget, et I 'amelioration de la qualite des comptes nationaux: le
support du projet a ce niveau a permis la reconstitution des capacites de modelisation
a la Direction nationale du Plan et de la Prospective, a la Direction de la Prevision et a
l'INSAE, la selectivite des projets, I'estimation de leur coAt y compris les fonds de
contrepartie et leur paiement , notamment par l'installation d'un systeme nformatise
d'analyse multicriteres pour la selection des Projets a inscrire au PIP;
l'informatisation de la Direction Generale du Budget et de la Direction du Tresor, et
la formation de cadres en comptabilite nationale et des agents techniques de la
statistique ainsi que l'harmonisation et la normalisation des concepts statistiques.
(ii) Renforcement de la capacite des agents de lafonctionpublique dans le domaine
de la gestion de I 'economie et des,finances et afournir au Gouvernement la capacite



de former son personnel: Plus de.....cadres 'A' de la fonction publique, a des niveaux
divers de conception et de gestion ont ete formes notamment dans les domaines de
planification economique, de gestion comptable et financiere, de statistiques, de
comptabilite nationale, de management et de leadership, d'informatique. Par ailleurs,
en assurant la provision de certaines formations par des centres locaux ou en associant
ces derniers a des bureaux exterieurs, leur capacite s'est retrouvee renforcee.
(iii) Appui au programme des reformes economiques du gouvernement: le Projet a
permis le Gouvemement de se doter d'un nouveau code de passation des marches,
d'un manuel de procedures et des textes d'application pour en assurer son execution
dans des conditions d'economie, d'efficacite et de transparence. De meme, les
institutions de contr6le de l'Etat ont ete appuyes pour leur permettre de jouer
efficacement leur roles de controle de 1'effectivite et de l'efficacite de la depense
publique. Enfin, le Projet a finance le cadrage de la reforme administrative et des
etudes connexes notamment pour un nouveau systeme de gestion de carriere et de
remuneration des agents de la fonction publique.
III Difficult6s rencontrees:
Non-fonctionnement des comites technique: les comites de coordination technique et
pedagogiques con,us pour appuyer la Cellule de coordination ont tres peu fonctionne.
La Cellule n'a pu beneficier de l'impulsion et du soutien que les grandes directions
comme le Plan et le Budget devaient lui apporter notamment dans la conception et
l'execution des taches afferentes aux activites de preparation, d'exdcution et de suivi
du budget. De meme le CEPAG n'a pas apporte au Projet son savoir faire au comite
pedagogique pour la conception des modules de formation ainsi qu'a leur mise en
oeuvre.
Contenu du Programme d'investissements Publics: En limitant le systeme d'analyse
multicritere a la Direction Nationale du Plan ( non 6tendu aux DPP des ministeres
sectoriels contrairement au schema retenu par I'audit sur la chaine PPBS, le PIP a
continue de souffrir de la faible coherence entre les strategies sectorielles et les projets
proposes. Ce qui fait perdurer les problemes d'execution et faible impact de beaucoup
de projets retenus dans le PIP, malgres I'appui massif apporte a cet egard par le
Projet.
Proposition des termes de references (TdR) pour les etudes et I 'assistance technique
prevues: le retard dans la proposition des TdR par nombre de ministeres et services
concemes, a considerablement ralenti le rythme d'execution du projet. On a du
differer, parfois surseoir, a des etudes pourtant considerees comme cruciales par les
services beneficiaires.
Elaboration des textes reglementaires du Code des marches publics: D'importants
retards ont et notes a 1'elaboration par le Gouvemement de textes d'application du
Code des marches publics, satisfaisants pour les partenaires au d6veloppement, et cela
malgre l'assistance technique apportee par le Projet. Le retard de cette activite qui n'a
finalement pu etre executee que dans les derniers mois du Projet, a eu comme
consequence le report de la formation et de la vulgarisation du Code, de ses textes
d'application et de son manuel de proc6dures.



Reforme administrative: Le support a la reforme administrative devrait se faire par
sequences successives. Dans cette logique, les premieres etudes devraient se
deboucher par des actes concrets quant aux recommandations pertinentes qu'elles
devraient faire. Les retards en raison de considerations socio-politiques pour executer
certaines de ces recommandations n'ont pas permis au Projet de financer d'autres
6tudes subsequentes.
Le fonctionnement du reseau: En depit de la livraison, de l'installation et du cablage
du systeme de reseau informatique, ce dernier n'est pas encore operationnel.
L'absence de connexion par des lignes telephoniques specialisees retarde l'utilisation
effective d'un investissement con,u tant pour la modernisation des services
administratifs que de l'amrlioration de leur efficacite inteme notamment pour la
preparation et l'execution du budget.
IV Cofit et gestion financiere du Projet.
Le coat final du projet est estime a $EU 7,2 millions par rapport au cout estime de
$EU 1 0 millions au moment de la restructuration. Les economies sont
essentiellement due a une reduction importante dans le nombre et le cofit unitaire des
services de consultants.
Schema definancement: Le schema reel de financement apres execution du Projet est
desormais pour le Gouvernement du Benin, $0,8 million (12%), le DANIDA, $3,5
million, (49%), et l'Association Internationale pour le Developpement, $2,9 million
(39%). Le credit IDA a 6te cl6ture avec un reliquat d'environ   million, et il reste
$0,4 million du don Danois. Une requete du gouvemement Beninois a DANIDA pour
l'utilisation du reliquat afin de achever inter alia, la formation informatique est en
cours de preparation.
Gestion comptable et financiere du projet: D'une maniere generale, la gestion
comptable et financiere du projet s'est deroulee de maniere satisfaisante. Les
differents rapports d'audit ont ete recus dans les delais et l'examnen desdits rapports
par les services competents de la Banque ces trois dernieres annees, n'a pas revele de
faits significatifs mettant en cause la bonne gestion.comptable et financiere du projet.
De meme toutes les recommandations des auditeurs pour leurs parties essentielles ont
ete mises en ceuvre au cours de l'execution du Projet. Une attention soutenue a
toujours ete accordee aux questions financieres avec la participation aux differentes
supervisions du charge de decaissement et/ou le specialiste en gestion financiere du
bureau local.
V/ Arrangements transitoires et perennisation des acquis du Projet.
La mission est d'avis que l'utilisation optimale ainsi que la perennisation des
realisation du Projet ndcessitent:
- le decaissement par le Tresor des fonds de contreparties relatifs a 1'exercice
budgdtaire 2000 afin d'eviter la constitution de tout arri&e relatifs aux activites deja
accomplies et receptionnees par le Projet.



- une budgetisation consequente des charges recurrentes liees aux
investissements installes.  II est par consequent necessaire que les ministeres
beneficiaires prevoient dans leur budget annuel l'amortissement, la maintenance et
l'entretien desdits equipements. Une telle solution est rendue aisee avec l'approche
PERC qui implique deja la quasi totalite des ministeres concemes.
- l'extension du systeme d'analyse multi-criteres aux ministeres sectoriels.
- la connexion effective du reseau pour permettre l'echange d'information entre
les differents services dans le processus de preparation, d' execution et de suivi du
budget. A cet egard, le Gouvemement doit retenir la solution technique la plus cout-
efficace et proceder a sa mise en ceuvre deja dans le contexte de la preparation du
budget de 2001.
- la continuation de la mise en ceuvre du plan de formation pour en faire une
activite permanente, notamment pour minimiser les effets pervers de la trop forte
mobilite des cadres et pour constituer de facon durable une masse critique d'agents
sans cesse performant grace une formation continue en cours d'emploi.
- la proposition d'un plan d'action et d'un calendrier pour l'application effective
des conclusions des differentes recommandations retenues dans le cadre de la reforme
administrative y compris le systeme de reforme du systeme de carriere et de
remun6ration.
- la formation dans les meilleurs delais des utilisateurs du reseau au logiciel
ORACLE.
La mission n'a pas d'objection a une extension par Danida de la date
d'utilisation du reliquat de son financement qui s'eleverait a environ 400.000 dollars
US, en vue de parachever ou de realiser certaines activites qui permettraient la
rentabilisation ou la perennisation des biens et servis fournis par le Projet. Dans un tel
cas de figure, le Gouvernement doit adresser une requete a DANIDA pour avis.
VI Principales legons.
Les le,ons a retenir de cette mission de post-evaluation peuvent se presenter comme
suit:
*  La formulation d'un projet d'appui institutionnel doit faire au prealable
l'evaluation des capacites du moment et partir d'une approche qui garantit la
pleine adhesion des beneficiaires.
*  L'appropriation du Projet par les beneficiaires, des sa conception initiale est
cruciale pour l'execution a bonne date des activites et pour l'obtention de resultats
satisfaisants et tangibles.
*  Les conditions d'entree en vigueur des Credits IDA doivent etre realistes et se
limiter au strict minimum.



* La formation en tant que moyen de creation ou de renforcement des capacites doit
etre une activite permanente pour optimiser et rendre durables les benefices qui en
resultent.
* La perennisation des acquis de projet en tant qu'appui institutionnel depend
essentiellement de la prise en charge des cofits recurrents par le budget national et
de la disponibilite effective de ressources nationales pour l'entretien et le
renouvellement le cas echeant, des investissements ( en materiel et en capital
humain).
VII Prochaines Etapes
Un rapport d'achevement du projet sera pr6pare par la Mission a son retour au siege
de la Banque et sera envoye au Gouvernement pour ses commentaires avant d'etre
finalise. La Mission aimerais recevoir le rapport d'achevement du Gouvemement
(actuellement en cours de preparation par la Cellule de Coordination) dans les
meilleures delais.
