MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OFIE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDff TO THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN
FOR AN ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed credit to the Republic of Benin of US$ 5.2 million equivalent to help finance an Economic
Management project (EMP). The credit would be granted on IDA terms with 40 years maturity.
BACKGROUND
2.           Since Benin adopted its first structural adjustment program in mid-1989, the country has
undergone a profound change in its economic and political institutions. Widespread popular discontent
with the political system and the mismanagement of the economy led to a sweeping change in the
country's political structure culminating in the National Conference in February 1990. The Conference
reaffirmed and urged the strengthening of the structu  adjustment sategy tbrough a restoration of
public finances, government divestiture from the public enterprise sector, and the provision of incentives
for private sector-led growth of investment and output. 'he former pervasive control system was to be
disaded and steps taW   to complete the libcalization of the economy. An interim Prime Minister was
appointed to implement the program and a new democratically elected Govenment and parliament took
office in 1991.
3.           The second strucural adjustment program adopted in 1991 aimed at deepening and
expanding the reforms initiued during the first phase through reforms in the fiscal system to improve
resource mobilization and expenditure management; administrative restructuring of key mkinstries; pursWit
of financial system restructuring and establishing an appropriate judicial and supervisory framewotk for
sound financial intermediation; rationalization of the public enterprise sector with a view to further
reducing the public sector's role in the ptoductive sectors and improving the financial performance of the
enterprises remainig in the Govaernment portfolio; further improvement in the trade regime and the
incentive structure for private investment; and meaes to protect vulnerable groups.
4.           It was clear from the outset that, following the new political opening, not only would
economic institutions have to be restructured, but the legacy of almost two decades of inappropriate
policies and inadequate human resource development would have to be overcome. Accordingly, the new
Governmentes adjustment program placed great emphasis on the administrative reorganiation of the key
policy-making ministries and on thoroughly reforming the education and training system. The program
received substantial donor support, under the overall coorinaion of the World Bank  as it was
considered one of the first test cases where the successful transition to democracy was accompanied by
a far reaching economic and social reform program.
5.           Implementation of reform measures under SAL I and the on-going SAL 11 have
contributed to a major improvement in macroeconomic and public finance performance. After having
declined substantially during 1989, real GDP rebounded, rising by 3.7 percent in 1990 and 4.7 percent
in 1991. Despite slower progress than anticipated, the Government has successfully pursued the reform



-2-
of the banking, public enterprise and trade sectors. With the establishment of four .ew private
commercW banks since 1990, the banking system is now better positioned to fulflil its role of sound
financial intermediation. Through privadzation and liquidations, the Government's public enterprise
portfolio has been reduced from 40 commercial and industrial enterprises in 1989 to 25 in late 1992.
With the exception, however, of the brewery, La Beninoise, which was privaized in 1992, the
privatization/liquidation of the major loss-making enterprises has only recently been initiated. In the area
of trade policy reform, the bulk of import licensing requirements was removed and the tariff structure
was simplified. The incentive framework for private sector activity was substantially improved through
the liberalization of prices, the adoption of a new investment code and revised labor and commercial
regulations.
6.           Notwitstandlng these achievements, implementation of the reform  program has
underscored the human resources and insdtutional weaknesses of the Beninese admintion as key
longer term issues which would have to be addressed in the adjustment process. A streamlined
government would be required to provide public services efficiently and to develop the capacity to
analyze, design, implement and monitor development programs and policies, beginning with the
adjustment program already underway. Internalization of the program by the staff in charge of its
implementation is hampered by widespread deflciencies in the economic concepts which are required for
the maemen of a market economy (see Technical Annex, para. 5). Weaknesses in economic
management will have to be overcome in such areas as macroeconomic programming, policy analysis,
investment programming and public finance management.
7.           The proposed project responds to the above shortcomings. It contributes to the
reorganizatior. of the public sector initiated under SAL II and supported by the donor community. During
project preparation, close consultations with the different donors have been undake to ensure
complementarity in institutional restructuring and capacity building efforts (see Technical Annex, paras.
1, 14, and 23). The project has been developed in close coordination with the IMA funded Pre-
investment project (Credit 2286-BEN) approved in FY91 (see Technical Annex, para. 21).
8.           Project Objectves. The proposed project is designed to improve economic management
capabilities in Benin. In particular the project alms at: (i) strengthening the preparation and management
of the Public lnvestment Program (PIP), the Budget, and improving the quality of the Nationa Accounts;
(ii) stengthening staff capabilities in economic and financial management, and establishing a pemanent
Government capability to train its own staff; and (ii) supporting the Government's overall economic
reform program.
9.           Project Description and iancing. To achieve these objectives, the project would: Ci)
provide support for the development of a training program to be carried out in a national training center;
and (ii) provide support to the preparation and execution of the PIP and the budget through technical
assistance to the Ministry of Planning, the Ministry of Finance and the sectoral ministries. The project
will also finance studies and consultant services to support the implementation of the Government's
economic reform program. The project's estimated cost over a four-year period is USS 12.0 million
equivalent (US$ 10.7 million, excluding contingencies). The project would finance the following
components:
(a) support to a training center, Centre de Perfectionnement et d'Assistance en Gestion des
Entreprises (CEPAG), US$ 5.0 million (Technical Annex, paras. 3-13) through provision of an
expert to assist in managing the center and developing a new program of short and long-term
taining in economic and finacia management. Two other experts, in addition to teaching at
the center, will provide the sectoral ministries with operational and pedagogical support for
programming and executing the PIP and the budgeL The project will also finance short-tem



- 3 -
internaional and national advisory services, training of trainers, equipment, supplies and
operating costs;
(b) support to the Mimisty of Planning (US$ 3.1 million) (Technical Annex, paras. 14-22) where
two experts wili provide operational and pedagogical support, one to the PIP and the other to the
national accounts. In addition, the project will finance equipment and studies;
(c) support to the Ministry of Finance (US$ 1.1 million) (Technical Annex, paras. 23-29), where
one expert will provide operational and pedagogical support to the staff involved in the
preparation and execution of the budget;
(d) support to the economic reform process through studies, short term expertise, and
implementtion of acdon plans in the areas of competitiveness, banking, tariff and judiciary
reforms (US$ 1.5 mUlion) (Technical Annex, pam. 30 and 31).
10.          The project is to be co-financed by the Government, IDA, the Danish International
Development Agency (DANIDA), and the Africa Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF).  The
Government's contribution amounts to US$ 0.8 million or 7 percent of project cost. An IDA credit of
approximately USS 5.2 million equivalent will finance 43 percent of project cost. A DANIDA grant of
US$ 4.0 million will finace 33 percent of project cost. An ACBF grant of US$2.0 million will finance
17 percent of project cost. DANIDA and ACBF contributions will be managed by IDA under joint-
financing arrangements.
11.          The project is expected to strngthen public invesment progi     and montoring,
budget preparation and execution, and the national accounts. Staff competence will be enhanced throug
a combination of: (i) formal training in economic concepts and techniques in the national training center;
and (ii) on-the-job training of national staff by the experts financed by the project. In the context of the
ongoing Goverment effort of administrative restructring undertaken under SAL II, the proposed EMP's
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) financed stuies in support of a reorganization of the Ministry of
Planning and the debt management unit (CAA) of the Ministry of Finance. The reorganization aims at
clealy defining the respective responsibilities of the different administrative units, and establishing
functional relationships as well as related information systens and procedures. In addition, the project
will support the Govermment reform program by fnancing studies, deploying high  aly consulta  in
specific areas, preparing ad implemendng action plans to meet specific needs of the economic adjustment
process as well as organizing workshops for discussion, conus building and internalon of
proposed reforms.
12.          Project Implementation. The Ministry of Planning, which is already the implementation
agency for the IDA-funded Pre-investment project, will have overall responsibility for the proposed
project as well. Given the complementary nature of the two operations (see Technical Annex, para. 21),
the administrator of the Pre-investment Project will also administer the proposed EMP. The
administration team of both projects has been strengthened by the recruitment of an assistant to the
administor and an accuanta. A technical coordination committee will be set up to monitor the
establishment and implementation of the new economic management procedures and systems to be
introduced under the project. The committee members are the directors of the majr economic
management directorates/units (Technical Annex, para. 35). A commitee for the monitoring of capacity
building actions will also be set up. It will include the members of the technical committee as wen as
the directr of CEPAG and the director of personnel in the Ministry of Administrative Refom (Teccal
Annex, para. 36). The PIP and national accounts epetts wfll report to tle M ster of Planning, while
the budget expert will report to the Minister of Finance, and the exper in the training center to the
director of CEPAG (echnical Annex, para. 37).

13.          Project Sustainabillty. The project aims at developing an effective and low cost
domestic training capacity in economic management and restricting future foreign-financed training costs
to the finacing of the training of national trainers. In order to achieve this objective, a methodology of
skills transfer from the eVpatriate experts to the national trainers In CEPAG will be established and
closely monitored. The methodology involves transfer of expatriate's pedagogical material to the center,
organization of co-teaching sessions, and pedagogical discussion sessions after classes. The project also
provides resources for training of CEPAG trainers.
14.          The project aims at strengthening the capacity of staff involved in economic management
by closely linking training and technical assistance efforts. For each of the economic management tasks
that the project targets, the resident expert will define the chain of required activities. Those activities
will be further broken down into a list of specific sub-task classified by degree of operational and
conceptual difficulty. The list of activities will be the basis upon which staff weaknesses will be identified
and resolved through training plans to be set up by the resident experts and the training center. The
training program will address the operational and conceptual difficulties that staff face in performing their
tasks. It will be designed with a view to improving knowledge as well as know-how. By focusing on
the performance of day-to-day tasks, the approach will help complement the academic training of high
level staff with a focused and operational upgrading of skills. Moreover, the identification of staff
weaknesses on the basis of the specific activities and sub-tasks assigned to staff would allow the Beninese
managers and Bank staff monitoring the project to better assess the relevance of the training provided.
Finally, such taining should improve the performance of day-to-day tasks within a reasonable time-frame.
The above approach should improve the monitoring of the progress achieved in upgrading staff sklls,
introduce transparency in staff achievement/failures, and facilitate skill transfer management and
monitoring.
15.          The reorganization of the Ministry of Planning will proceed in three phases. The first
phase, currendy financed under the PPF, consists of an operational audit and involves: (i) an assessment
of the existing sittation in terms of organization, human resources and materal supply; (i) a diagnosis
of the current deficiencies; and (iii) proposals for new functions, systems and procedures. In order to
encourage awareness and acceptance by staff of their new roles and responsibilities, workshops will be
held during the second phase which will start at credit effectiveness. The purpose of the workshops is
to discuss with staff the mandates, work program and outputs of each unit as well as functional
relationships and information flow between units. The third phase Involves the actual reorganization and
staff redeployment around the defined work program. Luring the unplementation of the reorganization,
the expets provided under the project will assist in the establishment of new procedures and working
methods, and will help organize the traiing needed to ensure internalization by staff.
16.          Lessons From Previous IDA Involvement.  Since 1977, IDA has financed three
technical assistance (TA) projects in Benin. The first (rural development) and second (petroleum) TA
projects, approved in 1977 and 1982 respectively, were limited to sectoral ministries. the objective of
the Rural Development TA (Credit 0716-BEN) project was to assist In planning and implementing
agricultura development policy. The project had 14 stated components or sub-components, some only
distantly related to others. By and large the execution of the project was not successful. The Petroleum
Sector TA project (Credit 1207-BEN) supported the construction, furnishing and equipment of a traing
center; establishment and implementation of a program for formal and on-the-job training for local oil
field workers; and professional training. T'he results of the trahiing for oil field workers, technicians and
professionals have been satsfactory. The overall dropout rate of trained professionals has been minmal.
17.          The Third TA project (Credit 1530-BEN), approved in 1984, responded to the
Government's interest in expanding TA to the area of economic nmagement. It aimd at correcdtng
deficiencies in macroeconomic planning (policy analysis and investment programming), project
preparadon, and public finance management (budgeting, budget execution and debt management); poor



data and information base and the lack of staff appropriately qualified to undertake the various task. TA
m also contributed signiftcandy to the design, coatent, and implementation of SAL I (Credit 2023-BEN),
approved In FY89 and SAL II (Credit 2283-BEN), approved In FY91. While TA m was Instrumental
in successfully addressing ad-hoc needs emerging during the adjustment process, and improving economic
management, it fell short of achieving sustained resuJts in capacity building due to a combination of
factors. After a long period of mismanagement and centralized planung, not only were staff poorly
trained and prepared for the new functions, but they were also highly demotivated. Furthermore, the
major change in the system of government and its leadership in 1990 induced administrative instability
and a high level of staff turnover at the same time as -he national leadeship's energies were absorbed
by the political transition. Following the stabilization of the political and administrative situation in 1991,
capacity building and institutional strengthening have become a priority on the Government agenda.
18.         According to the PCR of the first TA project in Benin, factors related to project
formulation which contributed to implementation difficulties or partial failure are: (i) too many
components; (ii) poor idendfication of some project activities; and (iii) over-optimistic targets. The
proposed project has opted for a simple and focused design. The proposed training component benefits
from lessons drawn from experiences in the sub-region. In particular, it draws from the design and
implementation of the first TA project in Benin and the second economic management project in Guinea
(Credit 1963-GUI). Both projects involve the development of national training centers and provision of
long and short-term training and signal the importance of addressing both kinds of training needs. This
combination proved useful in improving overall staff performance over a relatively short pedod of time
for the Benin TA II. In the case of Guinea, the two-year part-time training course at the national training
center (CNPG) was successful n providing staff with the concepts and techniques needed for the
management of a market oriented economy. In addition, the methodology used by the training center's
magement for skills transfer from the foreign experts to the national trainers achieved the tsfer
objective. The PCR of SAL I and the experience with SAL II indicate that TA m was instrumena in
the design and implemeation of both adjustment credits, and pinpoint the need for a component to
support the adjustment process.
19.         Rationale For IDA Involvement. IDA's strategy in supporting Benin's development
aims at restoring growth within an acceptable social framework and enhancing the sustainability of the
Government's adjustment and development efforts. A Country Assistance Strategy was presend to the
Board in FY92. A new Country Assistance Stmegy will be presented and discussed with the Community
Based Food Security Project, scheduled for March 1994. Through capacity building in the area of
economic management and the support it provides to the on-going adjustment program, the proposed
project will help achieve these objectives. Given its long-standing and privileged position in the dialogue
with Government on economic policy, and Its long-term view of capacity building, IDA is well positioned
to be involved in further strengthening of the country's economic management funcdons.
20.          Agreed Actions. The Government agreed to proceed with identification and selection
of suitable Beninese trainers for the taining center. They will be formally assigned to CEPAG nrior to
credit effectiveness. The Government has launched, under the PPF, the studies for the reorganization
of the Ministry of Planning and the CAA. The studies should be completed and agreement should be
reached with Govemment for the implementation of the recomendations as a condition of credit
effectiveness. Also, the Government should agree to fill the following key positions: directors of the
planning division and the statistical Instte (INSAE) in the Ministry of Planing, the debt management
unit (CAA) and the budget division in the Ministry of Finance, and the heads of the planning units in the
sectoral ministries. Finally, the government will formally establish the technical coordination committee
and the capacity building monitoring committee. As a condition of negotiations, the Government has
submitted to IDA a letter formally indicating its commitment to: (i) implement agreed recommendations
of the organizational audits of the Ministry of Planning and of the CAA; and (ii) define the modalities



- 6 -
for the Inclusion of all relevant information on staff training in personnel files so that such Information
is readily available and used for decisions on promotions and career deavelopment.
21.          Enfromnental Aspects. 'Me project is a C-classificadon. Benin recently completed a
National Environmunal Action Plan. The technical assistance and trainuig envisaged under the project
will take this into account in the program of capacity building for public investment planning and
management.
22.          Project Objective Category. The project is a capacity-building vehicle for public sector
management in Benin.
23.          Project Benefit. By strengthening the capacity of the civil service to manage the
economy, the project wili address one of the major constaint to the implementation and monitoring of
the economic reform process and to long term development.
24.          Risks. The main risks associated with the project lie in the quality of the advice and
training offered, a continued high rate of turnover of high level staff and inadequate use by Government
of trained personnel as competence is developed. Government has shown itself committed to
strengthening economic management capabilities and making optimal use of staff. To ensure that
adequate consideration is given to staff training and competence in career development during the design
of the up-coming phase of the administrative reform (see Technical Annex, para. 36), Government has
formally indicated in a letter to IDA, before negotiations, its commitment to define the modalities for the
Inclusion of all relevant Information on staff training and qualifications in persel files with a view to
liking training and competence to career development (see para. 20). Furthermore, the project provides
for the committee that will be set up to monitor the project's capacity building actions to include a
represettive of the Miistry of Civil Service and Administrative Reform. Finally, in order to ensure
quality of expertise provided under the project, the contas with resident eets and ainers would (i)
specify skill transfer modalities and performance indicators: and (ii) indicate that renewal of contract is
dependent upon performance. Government would be expected to cancel the contracts of non-performers.
25.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Disbursement
The bulk of the portfolio has been put in place since Benin's move to a democratic government
and a market-oriented economy in 1991. Credit effectiveness and, for that matter, project implemention
of some operations have been delayed because of the insistence of the newly elected Parliament, in which
the Government only holds a small majority, to review in detai the related legal documents. Moreover,
project implementation issues, such as poor administration of special accounts and non-compliance with
the Bank's procurement procedures have slowed down disbursements. A country implementation review
in June 1992 addressed these and other issues and agreed upon specific corrective actons, such as
carrying out an audit of the government debt management agency, restructuring of some projects and
organization of a disbursement seminar for project coordinators. A disbursement seminar was held In
February 1993. The reorganization audit of the CAA is expected to be completed shortly. Agreement
with IDA on an action plan based on this study is a condition of credit effectiveness. Moreover, in
September 1993, Government agreed to improve management of special accounts, formerly administered
by the debt management agency. Special accounts would be opened and maintained in a commercial
bank, in line with the Bank's Disbursement Department's recomnitndations.

SECTION A
DtAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Part 1: The Institutional Setting
1.           The proposed Economic Management Project (EMP) is designed in the context of a major
Government reorganization of the public sector initiated under SAL II and supported by Bank adjustment
and project operations, and by the donor community. The public sector reorganization involves a reform
of the fiscal system; an overhaul of public finance organization, systems and procedures; an
administratve reform including the reorganization of all ministries and a personnel entrenichment
progrm; and a public enterprise reform. Bank support is oriented towards the fiscal system and public
eterprise reforms, as welt as audit and reorganizaton of several sectors! ministries. UNDP provides
assistnce to the Ministry of Planning in the areas of macroeconomic planning and aid coordination and
supports the civil service reform piloted by the Ministry of Administrative Reform. The European
Community provides financing and technical support to the civil service departure program. In the
Ministry of Finance, the French Cooperation is assisting the Government in the overhaul of the revenue
directrates, and the IMF Is providing technical assistance to the budgetary process. Following close
consultations with the different donors, the proposed project has been conceived as complementary to
their institutional restrcturing and capacity building efforts. To ensure that this complementaity is
maitined, periodic donor coordination meetings and local round tables on capacity building issues will
be held during implementation of the EMP. The project is designed in close coordination with-the IDA
funded Pre-investment project (Credit 2286-BEN) which became effective on February 10, 1992 (see
para 21).
2.           The project will provide support to the following components:
(a)    Training program for economic and financial management;
(b)    Reorganization of the Ministry of Planning, and strengthening of public investment
programming, monitoring, and national accounts functions;
(c)    Strengthening budget preparation, management and execution;
(d)    Studies and action plans for the implementation of the Government economic reform
program.
Part I: Project Components
1. Training
3.           Rationale. Benin is In a transition phase from a centrally planned economy to a market
oriented one. The management of a market oriented economy requires a highly qualified civil service.
As this is currently not the case, the project puts major emphasis on the development of national
economic management skills to ensure the success of the transition process and in particular to the
implementation and monitoring of the adjustment program. The justification for the selection and
strengthening of a national staff training center in the economic management area is three-fold. First,
given   's  long lack of exposure to state-of-the-art economic and financi practices, it is crucial to
train staff in financial and economic management. Such training is especially warranted i the key



- 15 
economic management ministries as well as sectoral ministries. Second, capacity building is a process
of long duration; developing a domestic training capacity will allow Benin to become independent of
foreigl substitute technical assistance in the medium tenn, and to restrict foreign-financed training costs
to the financing of the training of national trainers. Third, the high level of staff turnover necessitates
the development of an effective and low cost domestic training capacity.
4.            Component objective. To strengthen the Government's civil service training capacity in
the area of economic and financial management and provide effective professional training to develop
skills of national staff.
S.            Asessment of training needs. During the preparation, pre-appraisal and appraisal
missions, a diagnosis of levels of skills and competence of staff was carried out based on existing
documentation and interviews with staff and expatriate experts working in the ministries. Training needs
and areas of training have been identified and training options have been discussed with Government.
In terms of analytical needs, despite the large number of staff holding university degrees, there are
widespread deficiencies in the mastering of economic concepts important for the management of a market
economy (welfare economics, public finance and economic incidence of taxation, economic and financial
project evaluation, exchange rate management), and in related analytical methods and technical skills.
In terms of operational needs, there is also a lack of staff having relevant long term experience in
economic management. As a result, even staff with a solid university background have not had a chance
to complement their academic training with relevant operational on-the-job learning experience.
6.            Choice of a training center. Five existng training centers in Cotonou were evaluated
and interviews with their management were held in order to identify the best possible candidate for the
project. The selection criteria used were: quality of leadership; pedagogical resources; management and
administrative capabilities; physical capacity; and location, i.e., proximity to the main ministries. Ihe
center which was selected, Centre de Perfectionnement et d'Assistance en Gestion des Entreprises,
(CEPAG), responded best to those criteria. CEPAG Is a public training center with management
autonomy. The center is currently providing training to private entrepreneurs for the most part, although
it does occasionally train public enterprise staff. It offers a variety of courses in accounting, auditing,
business management, and human resource management. The CEPAG management team consists of its
director and 5 trainers (an accounting specialist, a specialist in marketing and financial analysis, a
computer specialist, a business management specialist, and an auditing specialist). The Center offers an
average of 260 hours of courses a year. Its board comprises representatives of the Ministries of Industry,
Labor, Finance, and Planning as well as representatives of the women traders' association, entrepreneurs'
association, and chambers of commerce for industry and agriculture.
7.            Project option. Five national trainers will be selected by the management team of the
training center in collaboration with the project admiistration and will join the CEPAG team to carr
out the project's training program. The national trainers will be specialized in the following fields:
macroeconomics/public finance, microeconomics/cost-benefit analysis, statistics, human resources, and
computer science. The project will provide resources for short term training of trainers in their respective
areas of specialization. lhe national trainers will work in close cooperation with three international
experts that will be recruited under the project. One international training management expert will assist
CEPAG's team in implementing and managing the program of courses. Two economists will assist in
carrying out the training program (course design and teaching). In addition, the project provides
resources for short-term national and international advisory services. Total hours of courses per year to
be provided by CEPAG under the project are estimated at about 600 by the end of the first year of
operation, and 1,000 hours at peak level.
g.           TMe proposed project addresses the dual character of training needs, i.e., analytical as
well as operational, and closely links technical assistance work and training. Thus the expert to be funded



- 16-
under the project and seconded to the Ministry of Planning will assist staff in public investment
programming and monitoring as well as train staff on the job. In the process of assisting staff carrying
out the public investment programmig task, the expert wIll identify operational weaknesses. In
collaboration with the training center management the expert will design relevant training plans. The
national accounts expert in the Ministry of Planning and the budget expert in the Ministry of Finance will
follow the same approach. All training under the project will be provided through the training center and
will include: (i) a thorough coverage of the basic economic concepts and relevant tools and techniques;
(I}) applications to the regional and Beninese context; and (iii) administrative procedures regarding the
preparation and execution of the PIP and the budget respectively, and overview of Beninese laws and
regulations related to economic management. Two types of training prograw. are envisaged: (i) long term
ttainng i.e. a two-year part-time training program that interested staff could attend after working hours;
and (Ii) short term training organized for staffduring workib hours. During the pre-appraisal mission,
a detailed training program was drawn up based on the mission's assessment of training needs and on
existg training proposals which had been prepared by staff in the past and were made available to the
missionL During appraisal, the training program was discussed and agreed upon with staff in the different
administave units.
9.           The two year part-time program involves a first year of general economic training
(macroeconomics, microeconomics and statistics) and a second year of specialization in either public
fince or project management and evaluation. The two-year part-time program requires 600 hours of
courses a year. The targeted population is: (i) non-economists working in the technical ministries in the
areas of investment programming and/or public finance; and (ii) economists requiring an upgrading of
their economic skills and training in the analytical tools and technical sklUls needed for the management
of a market economy. In addition, the program would be open to all other staff who pass the enty test
up to a total of about twenty five to thirty students per class a year.
10.          The short-term training program will be tailored to address major operational deficiencies.
The targeted population is the teams of high level staff involved in the PIP and budgetary process as well
as high level staff in the statistical institute (INSAE). Training areas identified are: basic concepts and
thniques of economic and financial management; collection and processing of major statistics; project
analysis, preparation and supervision; relevant new systems and procedures as they are developed;
relevant computer software and technical applications. The project will retain a degree of flexibility to
address traning needs that may not be directly related to economic management but may have an
importantoperational impact such as procurement procedures of the different donors.. -
time management and so on. Funding for training abroad is limited to short-erm skills-upgrading
programs for the trainers and to practical trang for the four best graduates of the two-year training
program.
11.          The management expert will: (i) assist in organizing the logistics of training; (ii) ensure
that the pedagogical approach of the project as described above is maintained; (iii) assist in the
establishment of a permanent system of trainer evaluation and trainee testing, allowing the monitoring
of both trainers' and trainees' performance; and (iv) monitor the training of Beninese trainers and the
implementation of the skill transfer mechanisms within the truaing center (transfer of expatriate's
pedagogical material to the center, organization of co-teaching sessions, and pedagogical discussion
sessions after classes). The two other experts in the training ceter will teach at the Center. Since the
sectoral ministries are key actors in the public investment and budgetary process, it is essential that the
project provides operational assistance to their staff as well.  aerefore, in addition to teac4ing, the two
experts seconded to the traning centr wiUl provide support to the sectoral ministries in the prparation
and execution of the budget and the public investment program in coordination with the technical
assisne In the Mistries of Planming and Finance.

12.          Agreed Scons. Selection of the five tainers, based upon detailed tms  of reference,
to be attached to CEPAG to carry out the traiDing program is underway. To provide a suitable physical
envronment, the Govemment will provide the Center with adequate facilities.
13.          Expected results. Inprovement in the quality of the PIP, Budget, and ional statistics
produced; establishment of a permanent Government capacity to provide relevant staff training in the area
of economic management.
2. Support to the Ministry of Planning
14.          Raonale. Ihree fumctions of the Ministry of Planning make it a major actor in Benin's
economic development process. These are: the preparation of the public investment programming,
coordinatng and monitoring process; the production of national statistics and sectoral and macroeconomic
analyses; and aid coordination. With its current organization and resources the Ministy is poorly
equipped to perform  these functions successfully.  UNDP is currently providing support to
macroeconomic planning and aid coordination. Additional support is needed in the areas of statistics and
public investment programming and monitoring. The proposed project will provide this support.
15.          Component objective. The objective of this component is to improve the operation and
the performance of the Ministry of Planning through a reorganization which corresponds better to its
mandate and the strengthening of its key economic management functions: public investment
programming and monitoring, and timely production of reliable national accounts and major economic
indicators.
16.          Issues. The Ministry of Planning suffers from inadequate organization; unclear definition
of its role and of the missions and functions to be fulfilled by its diffeet department as weil as the tasks
to be performed for each of these functions; inadequate staff allocations across departments; poor work
program definition and planning; poor information systems and information flow witin the Ministry as
well as betwsen the Ministry and the rest of the adinistration, resulting in duplication of some tasks and
non-coverage of others. In most areas of competence of the Ministry - economic analysis, investment
programming and monitoring, and externa aid coordination - substandal improvements are needed both
as regards procedures and in terms of capacity of staff to produce the required outputs. UNDP support
to the aid coordination and macroeconomic planning finctions is expected to bring Improvements in these
areas.
17.          The Institut Nadonal des Statistiques et de IAnalyse Economique (INSAE) within the
Ministry of Planning, although staffed with competent staff, faces many of the same problems as the other
units: poor information systems and flows, work priorities and output defined with little regard to the
needs of the rest of the dinistrton and of the public; lack of disemination and publication of
compiled statisics.
18.          Project option. Ihe study for the reorganization of the Ministry of Planning funded
under the Project Preparation Facility  P) foresees the following mandate for the ministry: collection
and processing of economic information; design of macroeconomic policy and coordination of sectoral
policies with a view to ensuring their coherence with the macroeconomic ramework; public investment
programming coordination and monitoring. The study focuses on. () a clear definition of the respective
functions, tasks and responsibilities of the different units; and (u) the establishment of information
systems and flows, i.e., a clear definition of the content, form and frequency of information needed by
each unit from others to perform its tasms, and to be provided by each unit to others to allow them to
perform their tasks. The project adopts an Approach that encourages awareness and acceptance by staff



- 18-
of their new roles and responsibilities. Tne reorganization of the Ministry will proceed in three phases.
Ihe first phase is the audit per se i.e., a snap-shot of the existing situation in terms of organization,
human and material resources; a diagnosis of the malfunctioning; and proposals for new functions,
systems and procedures. The study is underway. At project effectveness, workshops will be held to
debate with staff the mandates, work program and outputs of each unit. Following the workshops, the
third and final phase involves the staff redeployment around the redefined work program.
19.          The project will also provide technical assistance to strengthen the national accounts and
investment programming functions. A national accounts specialist will be financed to strengthen the
capacity of the INSAE to compile and produce timely national accounts statistics and major economic
indicators. In addition, the expert will assist the Director of INSAE in the definition of the work program
with the underlying organization of work and functional relionships with the rest of the administration.
20.          To make the PIP an effective management tool, a resident expert specialized in Investment
programming will be provided to help staff in the ministry prepare, manage and monitor the PIP. In
coordination with the Pre-investment Project work on sectoral strategies and project feasibility studies,
the expert will help analyze the intersectoral linkages of the PIP; ensure that the PIP is consistent with
sectoral strategies, national priortes and existing budget and macroeconomic constraints. The expert will
ensure that the investment budget makes adequate provision for the Government's contributions to capital
expenditures and their recurrent costs. In addition, the expert will assist in the development,
implemenation and internalization by staff of the new PIP-related procedures, information systems and
flows within the Planning Ministry and between the Ministry and its partners (Ministry of Finance and
sectoral ministries). To facilitate performance of these tasks by the PIP expert, the project provides
resources for short term complemenry assistance.
21.          Compeentarlty with the Pre-nvestment Project.  The Pro-investment Project
comprises three components: (i) an institutional strengthening component Involving on-the-job training
and technical assistance provided to the Ministry of Planning and the planning units of the technical
ministries; (ii) an investment preparation component involving identification work, feasibility studies and
detailed execution plans of projxcts included in the PIP; and (iii) studies to upgrade the available
information on sectoral investment priorities to better define sectoral strategies. The project's focus is
on PIP feasibility studies and the development of sectoral strategies with a view to improving the quality
of the PIP's portfolio of projects. Its main beneficiaries are the planning units of the technical ministries.
The focus of the PIP component of the proposed EMP is on the public investment programming and
monitoring functions with a view to strengthening and improving the PIP programming and monitoring
process (strengthening of information systems and flows, establishment of procedures, improvement of
work methods and organization). The main beneficiary of the EMP component is the planming division
in the Ministry of Planning. At EMP effectiveness, the techical assistant provided by the Pre-investment
Project will work closely with the EMP technical assistance team. In line with the Pre-investment
Project's focus, the work of the Pre-investment expert will then emphasize the operational support to the
planming units In the technical ministries and coordination between the sectoral ministries and the Miistry
of Planning.
22.          Expected results. Better screening of projects; improved progring of public
investment and effective monitoring of its execution; better evaluation of recurrent costs and better
Integtation of the PIP into the annual budget; a stronger economic data base and timely preparation of
national accounts and main economic mdicators.

3. Support to the Miaistry of Fnance
23.          Radonale. The on-going public finance reform is crucial to the improvement of Benia's
economic management performance and requires major donor assistance. Ihe key elements of the public
finance reform are: (i) a restructuring of the tax system, with a view to increasing budgetary revenue
while simplifying the tax code; (ii) a fundamental reform of budgetary procedures and accounting aimed
at improving budget preparation and execution; (iii) a realignment of public expenditures reducing the
share of the wage bill in total current outlays, while increasing expenditures on goods and services; and
(iv) strengthening of the programming and monitoring of investment expenditures. In the context of the
reorganization of the public sector initiated under SAL II, the French Cooperation is financing an
organizational audit, and provides support to the customs, finance and tax administrations. The IMF is
the executing agency for a UNDP-financed support to the tax administration and the budget. Among the
key responsibilities of the Ministry of Finance, the budget, the debt and the procurement functions are
critical both to economic management and the governmen's ability to mobilize and manage foreign aid
for development. The African Development Bank (AfDB) plans to provide the debt management unit,
CAA, with a resident expert in debt management. The EMP will flnance the reorganization study of the
CAA and, as UNDP funding is exhausted and no more funding is in sight, take over the UNDP-financed
IMF assistance to the budget.
24.          Component objectives. Improve budget preparation, execution, and monitoring.
25.         Issues. The diagnosis of the budget process points to a number of issues: (i) lack of
economic analysis i.e., macroeconomic framework for the budget, economic development policies and
sectoral objectives; lack of revenue projections based on alteknative assumptions about import flows,
exchange rate and other relevant variables; (ii) the fragmented character of the national budget which
consists of several sub-budgets conceived and managed independendy, each of them having specific
financing modalities and management structures; (iii) cumbersome budget eecution procedures; and (iv)
poor budget information systems and flows.
26.          The debt management unt (CAA) suffers from an overextended mandate and a tendency
to substitute for other structures which results in poor performance in its primary debt management
function. Like INSAE, the institution fumctions in isolation, with litde awareness of and regard to the
needs of its major partners within the administration. In addition, the CAA has major difficulties
disbursing donor funds within reasonable delays.
27.          Project option. The project will pursue and build upon the work undertaken by IMP
assistance to the budget department in the Ministry of Finance, i.e., the establishment of a unified budget
incorporating all government revenues and expenditures with a new budget nomenclature; and coherent
procedures for investment and recurrent costs budgetng and control. A budget expert will be funded
under the project to assist in establishing procedures for budget preparation, execution and monitoring.
In addition, the budget expert will assist in developing the current budget document into a budget
integrating economic analysis, with alternative assumptions and projections.
28.          The PPF is financing a reorganization study of the CAA covering the following areas:
bottlenecks causing disbursement delays, debt management and projection activities, accounting methods
and procedures, and information flow between the CAA and its major partners in the sectoral and
economic management ministries. The conclusions and recommendations of the study will be discussed
with the Government and the Afl)B which ageed to incorpora  the relevant     ns in the
terms of reference of the debt management expert it will provide under a receny approved Tedical
Assistance Project in support of CAA.



-20-
29.          Expected results. Improved budget preparation and increased efficiency in budget
execution; increased efficiency in debt management; and improved and more transparent procurement.
4. Support to the Implemnta0on of the Econondc Reform Program
30.          In terms of project design, the primary focus of the project is on capacity building and
strengening of key economic management functions through the development of a national stff taining
center and the provision of technical assistance. As its second objective, the project Involves a
component, "support to the Government's economic reform program", through which the Bank would
finance necessary studies, short term advisory services, and action plans to meet needs emerging during
the implementation of the economic reform program. The analytical work finded under the EMP
component would set the stage for more comprehensive Intervention that could be assumed by other Bank
operations or by other donors. Through the preparatory work executed under the EMP, the Bank would
be in a position to provide useful input and set the stage for futre coordination if such intervention is
assumed by other donors.
31.          The project component consists of providing short term support to the economic reform
program in the following areas: (i) codification of legal texts, judiciary reform studies and related action
plans; (i) banking reform studies and an action plan to improve financial intermediation; (iii) action plan
for the implementation of the recommendations of a competitiveness study and the monitoring of
Indicators of competitiveness; and (iv) an action plan for the follow-up on the Implementation of a tariff
reform. The component will also ptovide support for the organization of workshops for discussion,
consensus building and internalization of the proposed reforms.
Pat m. Project Cost and  hiancg
32.          The project's estimated cost over a four year period is US$ 12.0 million. Total
contingencies are estimated at 12 percent of project costs. A detailed break down of costs is presented
in Schedule A. A total of 288 person months of technical advisers, of which 144 for the training center,
are planned under the project.
33.          The Government's contrbution amounts to US$ 0.8 million and will finance 50 percent
of local costs (7 percent of total project cost). An IDA credit of approximately USS 5.2 million would
finance 45 percn of foreign costs and 31 percent of local costs for a total of 43 percent of project cost.
A DANIIDA grant of US$ 4.0 mfllion would finance 37 percent of foreign costs and 13 percent of local
costs for a total of 33 percent of project cost. An ACBF grant of USS 2.0 million would finance 18
percent of foreign costs and 6 percent of local costs for a total of 17 percent of project cost.

SECTION B
PROJECT ADM15NSTRATION AND ITPLIEENTATION
Part I. Project Mnagement
34.          Ihe project will be located in and implemented by the Minitry of Planning which is
responsible for the implementation of the Bank-fuded Pre-investment Project. Given the complementary
nature of the two operations, the same project adminitator will coordinate the activities fimded by the
Bank Pre-vlestment Project and by the proposed EMP. Project administration has been strengthened
by the designation from within the ministry of an assistant to the administrator and an accountant. 'Me
Borrower will also provide office space and secretarial services to the dminision team. Tbe
Governmen will idetif and assign to CEPAG:. (i) a team of Beninese trainers comprising an
economistlpublic finance specialist, an economist/public investment specialist, a statistician, a computer
science specialist, and an education/human resource management specialist; and (ili) support staff,
including an admistrative assistant and two drives.
35.          A technical coordination committee comprising eight members will be established. The
committee members will be the directors of the major economic management directorates/units: Director
of Planning, Director of Budget, Director of INSAE, Director of CAA, and the heads of the coordination
and programing units (CPC) of the Ministry of Rural Development, the Ministry of Public Works, the
MWinistry of Education, and the Mistry of Health. This cmmittee wil monitor the establishment and
Implementation of the new economic management procedures and systems to be Itroduced under the
project; identify problems and bottlenecks as they arise, and propose solutions. One of the main objective
sought for under this coordination arrangement is to break the pattern of workdng in isolation, and to
initiate and sustain dialogue among the different administrdve units involved in economic management.
36.          Another committee wl. be set up for the monitoring of capacity building actions. In
addition to the eight members of the teccal coordination committee, it will include the Director of
CEPAG and the Director of Personnel in the Ministry of Administrative Reform. The committee for the
monitoring of capacity building will work closely with the Beninese trainers and the international experts.
The committee will be responsible for: (i) monitoring on-the-job training and skill transfer; (ii) ensuring
hat the short term trainig offered by the training center fui  the opeonal needs of the Beninese
economic management adminon; and (iii) ensuring adeqate use of staff as competence is developed.
lhe inclusion of a represetative of the Ministry of Administative Reform in this committee aims at
triggering a debate on the need for and the modalities of linking staff tralinig and competence to
promotion, remuneration and career development. Resulting propositions could feed into the on-going
UNDP-finmced civil service reform ZI.
37.          lhe project's focus on improving the public investment programming and fte budgetary
processes through capacity building and by reorgang insitutons and procedures has a major impact
on the role of the technical experts. The later will provide support to the capacity building effort as weU
as to the implementation of the reorganizaton, in particular to the coordination of the activities involved
in the public investment programming and budgetary processes (Section A, paras. 19, 20 and 27). It is
21 The first phase of the UNDP administrative reform project is underway. It aims at
establishing within the Ministry of Civil Service and Administradve Reform the technical
capacity to organize and implement the reforn. In this context, support is currently provided
for the reorganization of the ministry and training of its staff with a view to adequately
preparing the ministry for the next phase: the actual administrative reform design and its
implementation.



-22 -
therefore important that the expr  report directly to the relevant ministen. It was agreed during
appraisal that the budget expett will report to the Minister of Fnance, while the PIP, and  tonal
accounts exper will report to the Minister of Planning. The training managemen advisor and the
trn cter's expe  wil report to the Director of CEPAG.
38.         IDA, with the help of the project  n on team and the two committee mentioned
abowve, will undertke annual reviews of project progress. These reviews would be expected to result in
decisions concering changes in project design and/or imple on arrangements. Annual work plans
will be prepared by the Government and agreed by IDA. They will be based on the experience gained
during implementation of the previous year's work plan and on key monitoring indicators agreed upon
with the association. They should focus on overall progress in the implementation of the VariQus
components, the perormace of the teenical assse; the perfonnance of trainees and progress
towards impltmentation of the reorganization of the Mnstry of Planning and the CAA. An independent
Implementation mid-term review will be funded under the project by the end of the second year of project
execution. The mid-term review will assess progress in achieving project objectives in the following
areas: skills transfer; preparation and execution of the PIP and the budget as well as preparation of
national accounts.
Part U. Prourement, Disbursement and Reporting
39.          Prcurement.  The Association and the Government attach high priority to the
developmen in Beni of national consulting firms to substitute for costly inational expertise. It is
not, however, possible at the present stage of Benims development to rely on the local market to a
sigificmt degree; project activities will, therefore, require international recruitment of technical
assstat. The qualifications, exience and terms and conditions of employment of all consultants
would be satisfactory to the Bank and in accordance with Bank Guidelines for the use of consulants and
would be submitted to the Association for review and non-objection.
40.          Purchases to be finced from the proposed credit are not large enough to attract
nxernational competition. Contracts for office equipment, supplies, computers, and vehicles to be
financed by the credit, valued in excess of US$ 30,000 equivalent but less than US$ 100,000 equivalent
per contract and up to an aggregate total of US$ 400,000 equivalent wil be awarded on the basis of local
competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Associadon. Procurement of small items financed from
the credit and estimated at less than US$ 30,000 equivalent and up to an aggregate total of US$ 100,000
equivalent will be done locally (by shopping) after solicitation of quotations from no fewer than three
eligible suppliers. The threshold for IDA's prior review has been set at the equivalent of US$ 30,000.
For items under this threshold, an ex-post review will be carried out by IDA. Procurement arrangements
are summarized in Schedule B.
41.          Disbursement. The project is expected to disburse over four years. All eligible
expenditures will be financed net of taxes. All disbursements would be fully documented except for
payments against contracts of less than US$ 20,000 equivalent which would be made on the basis of
statement of expenditures (SOEs) and retained in the project administration unit for review by IDA
supervision missions and independent auditors. Disbursement arrangements are summarized in Schedule
B.



- 23 -
42.          Revolvn Fund. To expedite implementaton, the Govenment will establish a Special
Account at a commercial bank to be operated as a revolving fund for W:A's contribution to the project.
lhis account will be financed with an inidal deposit of USS 150,000 equivalent from the proposed credit
upon effectiness and presentation of an inital withdrawal application. The specW account will be
managed by the project adminstrator. IDA would replenish the account upon receipt of satisfactory proof
of incurred expenditures and evidence that such expendues were eligible for funding out of the Special
Account. Up-to-date bank statements and reconciliation of thte Special Accoumt would accompany the
replenishment requests which would be on the basis of filly documented reimbursement applications
except for contracts under US$ 20,000 equivalent, which will be submitted oni the basis of SOEs.
43.          Audlting. 'Te project administration team will be responsible for preparing withdrawal
appliations and SOEs to be submitted to IDA by the CAM and will indicate on the SOEs the nature and
origin of any goods and the payment date. These would be retained along with all other relevant
supporting docamenation (invoices, evidence of shipment, evidence of payment, etc.) for review by IDA
supervision missions and by the independent auditors. In addition, the project administration will
maintah records not only of project expenditures, but also of commitment, reimbursemen and the
status of project funds, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The project's
ftnancial accounts wil be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA and the audit
eports sent to IDA no later than six months after the end of the fiscal year.
44.          Reporting and monitoring. The project administrator will be responsible for: (i)
collecting semi-anmual reports from the experts and distributing these reports to members of the technical
coordination and capacity building committees; (ii) submitting to IDA brief but substantive semi-annual
reports on project implementation summarizing progress in all key areas, highlighting implementation
problems; and (iii) submitting a Project Completion Report to IDA no later than six months after the
closing date of the credit.
Part I. Condidons of Effectveness
45.          Credit effectiveness wil be subject to the following conditions:
(a)   agreement should be reached on implementation of the recommendations of the
studies for the reorganization of the Ministry of Planning and the CAA;
(b)   the following key positions are filled: Director of the Planning Division and
Director of INSAE in the Ministry of PlaMing; Director of the Budget Division
and Director of the CAA in the Ministry of Finance; Heads of the planning units

SCHEDULE 2
TRAIMNG PLAN
1.           Sources of recruitment. All staff training will be provided througb the training
center, CEPAG. The targeted group includes economists working in the key economic ministries
who need to upgrade their economic skills and get well acquainted with the analytical tools and
technical skills needed for the management of a market oriented economy; non economists
working In the technical ministries in the areas of investment programming and/or public fiance.
2.           Choies of training mode. Sources of training include: (i) CEPAG's Beninese
team of trainers; (ii) the long-erm experts to the training center and to the ministries of Planning
and Finance; (iii) short-term national consultants; and (iv) short-term international consultants.
The formal training provided by the above sources will be closely linked to the work of the
experts in the ministries who will train on-the-job staff in their areas of respeeive expertise and
operational responsibility. The resident experts in the training center will work with their
counterparts, i.e., the Beninese trainers in their respective areas of specializadon. The resident
expert in the Mhinstries of Planning and Finance do not have one-to-one counterparts, but instead
they assist the team of high level staff working on national accounts, public investment
programming, and budget progamming respectively.
3.           Responsibility for designing, delivering, and monitoring the training activities.
The primary responsibility A9r designing and delivering the training activities will lie with the
management of the CEPAG.
4.           To ensure the adaptation of training to the operational needs of the Beninese
admiistration, the technical experts in the ministries will participate in training desiga. The
terms of reference ([ORs) for the experts have been drafted. They will be finalized before
project effectiveness, to take fully into account the conclusions of the reorganization studies.
They have been designed in accordance with the project approach and focus on both operational
and training activities. In particular, for each of the economic management tools that the project
targets, the experts will have to define the chain of tasks involved and classify them from easiest
to most difficult both operationally and conceptually. The list of tasks will be the tool to identify
staff weaknesses and training needs, as well as to monitor staff progress and skill transfer. The
TORs will require the experts to report on training activities and staff progress on a semi-annual
basis, and signal in their reports all difficulties encountered in their capacity building efforts. The
TORs are based on the recent guidelines prepared by the Africa Technical Department and in
accordance with the Report on the Technical Assismce Review Task Force.
5.           The committee for the monitoring of capacity building actions will have the
primary responsibility for the monitoring of training (Section B, pam. 38).
6.           Expected results of training. Expected results are two-fold. In the short term, a
general improvement in the preparation of the key economic management tools should be atained
through the short courses provided to staff during working hours. In particular the expected
results of Xt training are better work methods, use of new tools and techniques, and better
knowledge of information requirements and systems. In the longer term, the overall training
program with its short and long term training components, should result in stronger economic
policy analysis, design and implemenation capabilities.
