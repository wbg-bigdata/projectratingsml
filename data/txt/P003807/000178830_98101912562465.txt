1. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      Indonesia's drive towards achieving greater self sufficiency in
food supply focusses on increasing rice production through greater use of
fertilizers; better pest-resistant varieties; expanded extension and
research services; continued upgrading and rehabilitation of existing
irrigation systems including tertiary networks, drainage and flood
protection works; and constructing a series of dams to provide dry season
irrigation water, hydropower, and flood control. Indonesia has about 4
million ha under irrigation. Over the last few years Indonesia has
initiated each year the rehabilitation and upgrading of about 100,000
ha of existing irrigation systems, construction of about 50,000 ha of new
systems, and installation of river control, flood protection and swamp
reclamation works to improve about 130,000 ha of agricultural land.
1.02      Extensive use is being made of foreign assistance for the large
irrigation improvement program, especially from the Bank Group which has so
far made available $757.5 million through 15 loans or credits for
irrigation and one loan for swamp reclamation. The Bank has an important
role in irrigation policy, setting standards for studies, engineering design
and construction, and in assessing investment priorities. Increasingly Bank
assistance has emphasized institutional building particularly of the
Directorate General of Water Resources Development (DGWRD). For the
proposed sixteenth irrigation project GOI has requested Bank Group
assistance for further strengthening DGWRD; training water users; for
studies and engineering design of two major subprojects in Central and West
Java for future construction (Cisanggarung and Jatigede); and for extending
irrigation systems to serve about 7,600 ha at Sitiung, which straddles the
boundary between West Sumatra and Jambi Provinces. The project was
appraised in May 1981 by a mission composed of Messrs. Naor, Hewson, Sun
(Bank), Sugimura (FAO/Bank Cooperative Program) Rudd and Oad (Consultants).
The Agricultural and Rural Sector
1.03      Objectives.  The Government's major objectives for the agricul-
tural and rural sector are to: (a) create productive employment to raise
incomes of the rural poor; (b) increase domestic food supply to keep pace
with rising demand; (c) expand agricultural exports particularly of small-
holder tree crops; and (d) ensure productive, sustainable use of Indonesia's
varied land, water and other natural resources.



-2-
1.04      Despite a 4% average annual growth of production, agriculture's
share of GDP has declined from 40% to 30% since 1968, while its share of
exports dropped from 45% to 33% due mainly to the markedly increased value
of oil exports. Nevertheless, the agricultural and rural sector remains of
overwhelming importance to the great majority of Indonesians; nearly 80% of
the population lives in rural areas, and agriculture is the major source of
income for about two-thirds of rural households and one-tenth of urban house-
holds. Some 15.6 million smallholder families produce subsistence and cash
crops on 15.8 million ha, while 1,800 estates occupying 2.2 million ha
produce mainly rubber, sugar, tea, palm oil, and tobacco.
Development Strategies
1.05      Employment.  Agriculture's share of total employment decreased
from 69% in 1961 to 64% in September 1971, while in 1978 it accounted for
61% of total employment./1 Nevertheless, agriculture remained by far the
largest single source (with 42%) of new employment during 1971-78.  Outside
Java, employment prospects in agriculture appear quite promising, given the
sustained increases in the smallholder area, due to land reclamation and
irrigation development, including both Government-sponsored and spontaneous
transmigration. In Java, rehabilitation of irrigation systems, which
generated significant employment in the last decade, should continue to
provide additional construction and farm work.
1.06      Food Crops.  Given its limited manpower and financial resources,
GOI has concentrated on increasing the production of rice, the preferred
staple food of the great majority of Indonesians. Rice production increased
rapidly (4.5% p.a.) between 1968 and 1974, chiefly due to irrigation
rehabilitation and the provision to irrigated rice growers of fertilizer and
high-yielding variety seed, financed largely through the BIMAS credit
program. The growth rate slowed markedly to 1.7% p.a. over 1974-77, in the
wake of severe declines in fertilizer usage (due to restrictions on private
sector fertilizer trade), successive seasons of untimely rainfall, and
unprecedented attacks by pests and diseases, principally the brown plant
hopper and associated viruses. In 1978 rice production increased by 10%
with favorable weather, improved and liberalized fertilizer distribution,
and nationwide Government-sponsored distribution of recently introduced
pest-resistant varieties. Rice production in 1979 increased only 2% over
1978 due, mainly, to insufficient rainfall but 1980 saw one of the largest
proportional increases (13%) in national rice production since records have
/1 Seasonal fluctuations can be seen from the share of agricultural employ-
ment in March of 1976 ranging between 63% in Java and 72% in the Other
Islands. The corresponding figures in October were 57% and 66%,
respectively. These seasonal differences represented a drop of 6.7
million workers in agricultural employment.



been kept. Production exceeded 20 million tons milled rice equivalent and
rice imports declined to about 1.4 million tons or 15% of world imports, a
considerable turnaround from the previous three years. The estimated
production for 1981 is 21.6 million tons. Over the past decade, output of
secondary food crops (maize, cassava, soybeans, peanuts, and sweet potatoes)
grew more slowly, at an average of only 1.6% p.a., composed of a 1.1% p.a.
average decline in area (much of this land shifting to irrigated rice) and a
2.7% p.a. increase in yield.
1.07      Tree Crops.  The Government has embarked on a major effort to
develop smallholder tree crops outside Java as part of its national rubber
and coconut replanting and transmigration programs. The objective is to
improve production in existing plantations while developing large areas of
new land for settlement. One of the Government's main approaches has been
to use public estate companies to plant tree crops on land to be settled by
local landless families as well as by transmigrants. These companies clear
the land and provide settlers with planting material, other inputs,
processing and marketing facilities. This approach is appropriate in view
of constraining management and technical capabilities.
1.08      Future Strategy.  To prevent a widening food production consump-
tion gap, productivity and area under rice and secondary food crops must be
increased. In Java, rice-cropping intensity could be raised through water
storage, ground water development, and flood control projects although
relocation of inhabitants of reservoir sites may delay progress. Yields and
cropping intensity can also be increased by improving water management at
all levels which will require increased O&M efforts of government-operated
and farmer operated systems. In the Other Islands there is potential for
new irrigation and swamp reclamation schemes which GOI is in the process of
developing. Yields of existing varieties of secondary food crops could be
increased by improved husbandry, including fertilizers and insecticides.
GOI is just beginning to give serious attention to varietal improvement of
such crops.
1.09      Area Development and Transmigration.  In 1980, about 88 million
people lived in Java, at a density approaching 650 persons/sq km. The
island, with 7% of Indonesia's land area, has 45% of the cropped area and
63% of the population. Java generally has more fertile soils and better
infrastructure than the Other Islands; however, its cultivable land is
almost fully utilized. In some watersheds cultivation already exceeds
ecologically safe limits, contributing to increasing erosion, flooding, and
siltation of reservoirs, irrigation canals and ports. GOI is preparing
integrated watershed development projects to address this problem. The
primary program for new area development in the Other Islands, as well as
for creating employment and settlement nuclei for Javanese migrants, is
transmigration. An organized transmigration program is important for
regional and natural resource development in the Other Islands, production
of food and export crops, and creation of employment and decent living
conditions for landless Javanese.

1.10      Role of Government.  While the private sector should be encouraged
to expand its role in agricultural input supply, marketing, and processing,
Government continues to bear the major responsibility for infrastructure,
resource conservation, and other services. Despite marked improvements over
the past decade, technical and managerial manpower constraints continue to
impede planning and rapid implementation of agricultural and rural develop-
ment, including irrigation and drainage works. GOI must therefore continue
to strengthen its key rural development institutions, particularly through
education, recruitment, training and retention of technical manpower.

1.11      Bank Lending for Agriculture.  Since the first of 16 irrigation and
swamp reclamation projects was approved in 1968, the Bank Group-s
agricultural lending has rapidly expanded to include estate and smallholder
tree crops, fertilizer production and distribution, sugar, livestock,
fisheries, research, extension, training, seeds, transmigration, and resource
survey and mapping. The Operations Evaluation Department-s Sector Operations
Review of Bank Group agricultural lending in Indonesia (Report No..2166,
dated August 9, 1978) concluded that despite deficiencies in some projects,
the Bank's portfolio was "of overall good quality and likely to contribute
substantially to increased production." Within the context of GOI's
agricultural objectives and priorities, as outlined in Repelita III, future
Bank lending is expected to focus on:
(a) irrigation, water storage, drainage and flood protection to
intensify rice cropping on Java and to expand water resources
infrastructure including swamp reclamation in the Other Islands;
(b) smallholder and nucleus estate tree crop planting programs
including industrial forest estates; and
(c) area development projects aimed at (i) watershed management to
conserve soil and ensure long-term productivity in the densely
populated areas of Java; (ii) rural works programs; and (iii)
transmigration.
Bank Assistance to the Irrigation Subsector
1.12      The Bank has provided $757.5 million for project assistance
in irrigation and has played a significant role in Indonesian irrigation
development since 1968 (Map IBRD 16039). The earliest Bank supported
irrigation projects were designed to rehabilitate major systems to quickly
increase rice production. Later projects upgraded existing systems and
financed drainage and flood protection works and tertiary networks. There
has been little construction of new systems. Studies supported by the Bank
for possible investment in the next few years include large storage dams to
serve existing irrigation system. Bank assistance was channeled through
two special agencies /1 of the Directorate General of Water Resources
/1 PROSIDA and PIBD

(DGWRD) which were set up to implement Bank projects, but now supports
also operations of the Directorate of Rivers, (Loan 1691-IND) the
Directorate of Swamps (Loan 1958-IND), and the Directorate of Planning and
Programming (Cr. 995-IND).
Performance Audits on Completed Projects
1.13      The first four Bank-assisted irrigation projects have been
completed and performance audits issued./l The most serious problems were
construction delays and cost overruns. Delays arose mostly because of
GOI's unfamiliarity with international procurement procedures, cumbersome
local bidding, contracting and fund release procedures, and shortage of
local funds. Cost overruns were due to additional quantitities of work
found to be needed following detailed design, and increased unit costs from
unexpectedly rapid inflation and construction delays. However, these cost
increases were more than offset by higher rice prices. Although it is not
possible to disaggregate benefits between irrigation and supporting services
due to concurrent and subsequent projects, economic rates of return of the
four projects are expected to exceed 40%.
1.14      These lessons were taken into account in formulating and imple-
menting subsequent projects. Appraisal quantity and cost estimates are now
based on final designs for at least the first year's work program and major
structures. Multi-year contracts with price escalation provisions, standard
contract documents and standard bid evaluation procedures have been
introduced together with mobilization and prompt payment provisions. Other
problem areas being tackled include: improving effective operation and
maintenance services (O&M) at the provincial level; providing technical and
administrative support to water user associations; and promoting greater
efficiency in water use.
1.15      In recent Bank assisted irrigation projects, measures have
been taken to improve O&M including providing adequate staff; and increased
and timely budgetary support. These measures improved O&M funding, but not
standards. Specific proposals to improve O&M in East Java Province are
included in the proposed seventeenth irrigation project and may be proposed
in later projects for other provinces. The importance of ensuring farmer
commitment to tertiary development was recognized from the first tertiary
subproject supported by the Bank (Ln. 1268-IND). Water user associations
are established before starting tertiary construction and later collect
member contributions, normally in kind after each harvest for O&M. Actions
are included in the project to provide better training and support for such
water user assocLations (paras 3.06, 8.01f and Annex 5).

Bank Review of DGWRD Operations and Performance
1.16      In 1975 and 1978 the Bank reviewed GOI's irrigation program, its
contribution to national food supply, and the ability of DGWRD to expand its
activities./l These reviews reported on the remarkable success of DGWRD and
the ability and energy of its senior staff, but concluded that the present
staffing and organizational structure of DGWRD needed further strengthening.
1.17      Although measures have been taken to accelerate project imple-
mentation since then, many projects still suffer delays, primarily during
the startup period. Bank Group experience since 1978 confirms that the
present DGWRD implementation capacity limits project and disbursement
performance. The major causes of delayed implementation identified during
supervision and the actions taken to address them are discussed below.
(a)  Delays in land acquisition.  Possible Bank assistance is being dis-
cussed to strengthen the Directorate General Agraria (DGA), which
is responsible for land acquisition and registration. Measures
have been agreed to use private surveyors or DGWRD surveyors where
DGA capacity is presently insufficient. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that all land rights required for construction
would be acquired in the year preceding construction (para. 8.01b)
(b)  Inadequate contractor capacity and construction standards.  A
project to assist contractors through training and to improve
supervision of construction contracts has been prepared by the
Ministry of Public Works and is being appraised by the Bank. The
Bank is also assisting GOI to review construction industry
policies and procedures;
(c)  Difficulties with surveying and mapping.  The Bank has recommended
improvements for quality standards and procedures. Equipment to
expand and modernize surveying and mapping, and training of
contractors and DGWRD supervisory staff is being provided under
Irrigation XV (Cr. 995-IND). The GOI has also agreed that the
National Agency for Coordination of Survey and Mapping
(BAKOSURTANAL) will oversee all GOI agencies' large-scale mapping
needs, monitor available photography and mapping capacity, and
increase capacity if needed (Section 4.09 of Loan Agreement
1972-IND);
(d)  Delayed fund releases.  GOI's budget system and fund release
procedures have been improved, and training in procurement and
disbursement procedures given to staff. Measures to improve
budget processes in DGWRD have been initiated; and
/1 The Irrigation Program Survey (No. 705-IND), April 15, 1975 and the
Irrigation Program Review (No. 2027a-IND), October 16, 1978.

(e)  Reduced DGWRD annual budget allocations._ GOI allocations for the
irrigation sector have not kept pace with expectations of the
Third Five-Year Plan and increasingly projects have been delayed.
There is an overall shortage of funds for the sector program, and
not enough flexibility for DGWRD to quickly divert funds during
the budget year from slower moving projects to those which need
more.
1.18      These steps to improve project implementation performance have
been accompanied by an increasing dialogue between the Bank and GOI towards
strengthening DGWRD's institutional capacity. The critical areas being
addressed are:
(a) improving planning and programming, and the budget system to
concentrate available financial resources on priority irrigation
investments. DGWRD project appraisal capacities are being estab-
lished, a coordinating unit for benefit monitoring and evaluation
is being strengthened, and appropriate economic criteria are being
determined for project selection and preparation;
(b) improving the flow of management information related to resolving
problems of project implementation, including procurement and
construction progress so that managers can take earlier remedial
actions whenever necessary;
(c) reducing the administrative and executive burden on the Director
General, and increasingly delegating responsibilities. Several
alternative structural changes are under consideration by GOI;
(d) progressively reducing the extensive use of foreign consultants
employed by DGWRD for feasibility and engineering design work, and
to a lesser extent for construction supervision; and
(e) reviewing the DGWRD work program and budgets proposed from 1982/83
to 1988/89 and the relevant institutional implications.
1.19      Institutional strengthening has become an increasing objective of
Bank assistance. Bank inputs will also seek to address policies and
procedures which could improve the sector program or accelerate project
implementation. While the institutional strengthening now started is
progressing, lending, which will include increasing cofinancing, will focus
on technically complex projects where high design standards must be set, or
difficult economic choices made. These measures are designed to move
progressively towards sector lending.



Disbursement Performance and Trends
1.20      Disbursements of previous Bank irrigation Loans reflect the
delayed project implementation schedules. Currently, cumulative disburse-
ments (Irrigation V-XV) run at about 55% of appraisal estimates, with little
difference between projects. This performance is in line with experience for
Irrigation Projects supported by the Bank in the Region, and with other
sectors in Indonesia. Progress has been made in improving disbursements
(which were below 50% in FY80) through more intensive supervision by the
Bank's staff resident in Indonesia, the use of statements of expenditures for
small civil works contracts, and by accelerating start up activities of new
projects. For the sixteenth irrigation project consultant short lists and
proposed direct invitations for consulting services were agreed with the Bank
at appraisal, and evaluations of proposals were in progress at the time of
negotiations. Because lengthy bid evaluations and GOI procurement control
clearances have frequently delayed contracts, during negotiations GOI agreed
that the notice of award for the most important start up civil works contract
for project construction will have been issued before Loan Effectiveness
(para. 8.03). These actions, together with other actions in progress to
reduce project implementation delays (para. 1.17) are expected to result in
progressive improvement.
Project Formulation
1.21      Sitiung II.  The Government is developing the Sitiung (Sungai Dareh)
project site in central Sumatra for resettlement of farm families displaced
by constructing the Wonogiri Dam on the Solo River in Central Java. Settle-
ment took place between 1976 and 1978, with families each receiving 1.0 ha of
land to be irrigated when construction of the systems is completed, 0.75 ha
of upland, and a 0.25 ha houselot and garden. The Sitiung site lies along the
Batang Hari, a river with ample water supplies for irrigation of 20,000 ha.
The Bank, under Irrigation IX (Loan 1435-IND), agreed to finance the construc-
tion of Stage I, an interim low-lift pump irrigation scheme from this river
designed to serve some 3,300 ha which is presently nearing completion. By
October 1976 (when Irrigation IX was appraised) studies for a larger gravity
system had not progressed beyond prefeasibility level, but analysis by the
Bank indicated that the Stage I would be viable on its own. The Bank also
agreed under Irrigation IX to support completion of a feasibility study for
developing the remaining 16,700 ha of the project area, and contingent on
its results, the preparation of detailed designs and tender documents.
1.22      The feasibility study showed that gravity exploitation of water
from the Batang Hari would require a large diversion structure which could
not be economically justified. The alternative construction scheme comprises
two small separate gravity diversions, one on the Batang Siat and one on the
Batang Piruko (two tributaries of the Batang Hari) and two independent
headrace canals to furnish irrigation supplies to an area of about 10,000 ha.
These supplies would be supplemented by occasional pumping from the Stage I
pumping plant on the Batang Hari during water shortages (para. 2.06). The



-9-
service area would comprise the pump supplied 3,300 ha developed under Stage
1, and about 6,700 ha of newly developed land./l A series of cropping trials
carried out in the course of the study, indicated that initial low irrigated
rice yields, which were the result of high soil acidity and poor soil
fertility, could be improved to acceptable levels within four years. These
expectations are consistent with actual experience in the nearby Mimpi
Irrigation system, contiguous with the project area and on the same soil
types. Proposals for alternative land use, especially rubber, were examined,
but GOI and transmigrants strongly prefer irrigated rice to rubber.
1.23      Cisanggarung River Basin Study.  The Cisanggarung River borders the
Cirebon Irrigation System in West Java, and is one of the larger streams
entering the Java Sea near the town of Losari. It is a source for irrigation
water during the dry season, but causes floods during the rainy season.
Together with other systems in the Cirebon area, run-of-the-river supplied
irrigation systems have been rehabilitated under Irrigation Project VI (Loan
1100-IND) and drainage improvements for the Pemali-Comal area, to the east of
it, were designed under Irrigation Project VII (Loan 1268-IND). This latter
activity led to a feasibility study of drainage and flood control of the
coastal Pemali-Comal area including the Padakaton block which is seasonally
flooded by the Cisanggarung. The study showed that structural flood control
was expensive and not justified. The Cisanggarung River Basin study would
continue the search for a technically and economically viable solution
which would address not only flood control in the coastal area, but water
shortage during the dry season as well.
1.24      Detailed Design of Jatigede Dam.  Feasibility studies of the
Jatigede Dam on the Cimanuk River in West Java, were carried out in 1973/74
by consultants (NEDECO-SMEC) under Irrigation Project IV (Credit 289-IND).
The studies indicated the viability of a 120 m high multi-purpose earth and
rockfill dam with ancillary power plant, storing about 1.5 BCM (billion cubic
meter), for the irrigation of about 75,000 ha at Rentang and the production
of about 800 GWh of power from a final installed capacity of 400 MW./2
Following these studies, the Australian Government financed detailed design
of the dam. The Bank, under Irrigation Project VI (Loan 1100-IND), financed
the construction of a new barrage, tertiaries and drains at Rentang. In line
with GOI's decision in 1976 to defer construction of large dams to the Fourth
Five-Year Plan (Repelita IV, 1984-88) activities then focussed on
rehabilitation of systems in the service area. During this period (1975-81),
rice cropping expanded and production grew with the support of run-of-the-
river irrigation, mostly from the Cimanuk and from numerous creeks entering
the project area. In 1981, GOI decided to review the Jatigede Dam's
/1 The Batang Piruko and Batang Siat systems could irrigate some 10,900 ha
of land. However, it is expected that only 10,000 ha of the service area
will be under cultivation and the balance under forest including forest
rubber.
/2 A second option included an installed capacity of 400 MW and
the irrigation of 115,000 ha; and a third option - the diversion of the
Cilutung River into Jatigede's reservoir thereby increasing its
power potential to 800 MW.



- 10 -
feasibility, and assess changes in the area since 1973./I  An interin report
by the consultants in November 1981 /2 indicated that there had been
considerable increase in rice cropping intensities, and suggested the
construction of a lower 100 m high dam (instead of the already designed 120 mi
high dam) which would create a storage volume of about 800 MCM, for the full
irrigation of about 20,000 ha to 23,000 ha of rice during the dry season and
for the generation of firm, peaking energy of 165 GWh/year and of non-firn,
secondary energy of 465 GWh/year from an installed capacity of 100 MW. A
review of this report indicated that the project's economic rate of return
is very sensitive to a correct assessment of the true "without dam" extent
of dry season rice growing. Since, however, the water demand of all rice
growing areas reported as "already irrigated" exceeds known available
supplies at Rentang, it was decided to review the extent of rice cultivation
in the dry season, its water supply and demand, and carry out additional
reservoir operation studies to optimize benefits from irrigation and power.
The result of these studies, scheduled for June 1982 would be reviewed by
the Bank and if construction of Jatigede shows good justification, funds
allocated for detailed design would be released.
Policy and Institutional Objectives
1.25      The project has been formulated to address an important policy
issue - the role of water user associations and a clear definition of
responsibility amongst the several government agencies working with such
associations for supporting and training them. Although associations have
been formed before constructing tertiary networks (para. 1.15) in some cases
the formal associations have cut across traditional arrangements between
farmers. Increasingly in some parts of Indonesia the traditional groups are
being reactivated or expanded instead with good results. Experience,
nonetheless, with the massive national tertiary program has pointed to the
need to consult farmers and their associations earlier and to a greater
extent during the design phase for tertiary networks to ensure that they
agree fully with the objectives and operational procedures, and afterwards
operate and maintain then properly. Without such consensus, the works
constructed have sometimes not been properly used nor maintained.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that this would be done (para.
8.01e), and for ongoing tertiary design under previous loans, to employ
community organizers to assist design consultants.
1.26      The second problem relates to the nultiplicity of official
contacts for water user associations. At present the provincial irrigation
services, DGFCA extension services, and the local administrations of the
Ministry of Home Affairs have sometimes overlapping responsibility for
/1 Financed under Irrigation Project XIII (Loan 1691-IND).

training and supporting water user associations. For instance, the farmer
groups organized by the extension services for the training and visit
system in irrigated areas sometimes do not coincide with water user associa-
tion membership patterns. As agreed at negotiations, GOI will review the
present responsibilities of the different agencies and after consultation
with the Bank, will implement any changes needed (para. 8.01f).
1.27      Finally, training for water users and those officials responsible
for their support will be carried out under the project. The training
objective would be a unified understanding of technical and organizational
aspects of tertiary systems operation among the local staff of agricultural
extension, irrigation and local government bodies, water user association
officials, and key farmers. The training components would include: (a)
review and improvement of curriculae and training methods for ditchriders
(ulu-ulus) and water users; (b) preparation of training hardware and
software (including audiovisual aids); and (c) training of "trainers"
(extension agents) in appropriate methods and procedures to train
ditchriders and water users. The program would be executed through DGWRD's
training centers at Surabaya and Ujung Pandang and DGFCA's training center
at Cirebon.
1.28      Institutional objectives under the project are to support the
strengthening of DGWRD management, specifically through reviewing management
information systems, designing and testing systems for monitoring physical
and financial progress of the many subprojects under construction, and
streamlining and accelerating the flow of essential information needed for
management purposes. Communication links with field projects will be
improved, and the processing time of data greatly reduced by using a
computer already installed by GOI for DGWRD use. Particular attention will
be given to studying which management functions and systems should be
common to other Directorate Generals of the Ministry of Public Works and
coordinated through the MPW Secretary General's offices.
1.29      During negotiations, GOI and the Bank further discussed the need
to improve DGWRD budget procedures and systems. GOI indicated it expected
to progressively introduce and improve computer based systems which would
clearly identify annual and multiyear budget commitments for projects under
construction, proposed new projects, and proposed sources of funding. The
GOI informed the Bank it would make available to the Bank for comment the
projected five-year DGWRD development budget and work program, and by May 1 of
each year, the approved annual budget.
1.30      Other institutional strengthening under the project will consist
of expanding the irrigation water data base by installing a wider network of
river and rainfall gauges, and improving the analytical capacity of DPMA
(para. 3.05).

2. PROJECT AREAS
Location
2.01      The Sitiung subproject is located some 150 km east of Padang, West
Sumatra, in alluvial plain some 6-10 km wide and about 30 km long bordered
by the Batang Hari River on the' north and the Trans-Sumatra highway on the
south (Map IBRD-16003R).
Climate
2.02      Climate in the areas is tropical and bi-seasonal.  Most annual
rainfall of about 2,600 mm occurs between November and May (Annex 5),
resulting in floods during the rainy seasons and drought during dry
seasons. Temperatures are fairly constant, varying slightly from an average
of 260C. Relative humidities are high year round (70%-85%) and mean
monthly evapotranspiration rates vary between 122 mm and 300 mm.
Topography, Drainage and Soils
2.03      The river valley in which the Sitiung subproject is located is
comprised of flat to gently undulating terraces, composed of deep well
drained yellowish-brown clays. It is dissected by numerous creeks,
tributaries of the Batang Hari, Piruko and Siat, cutting back from the
rivers into which they drain. Dominant soils are a mixture of red-yellow
podzolic and alluvial soils, which are short of phosphorus, generally acidic
(pH 4.5-5.5), and of low productivity. Year-round flooded paddy cultivation
has been shown to raise the pH to 6-6.5 and with applied fertilizers has
been shown to improve productivity to satisfactory levels within a number of
years.
Population, Farm Sizes and Land Tenure
2.04      Prior to the official transmigration starting in 1976, the Sitiung
project area had an indigenous population of about 6,400 families living in
margas (traditional communities) which state claims to all land whether
cultivated or not, and grant cultivation rights to their members commensurate
with the member-s farming capability. In view of low soil productivity and
absence of irrigation and fertilizers, marga members practice shifting
cultivation where food crops are grown for two or three years in one
location and then replaced by rubber trees by which members maintain land
claims. Tapping of such low productivity rubber is the main economic
activity of indigenous farmers. In contrast, settlers brought in by
Government from 1976 have been given 1 ha of land which will now be
irrigated, 0.25 ha for a houselot and an additional 0.75 ha of rainfed
upland. To compensate the Margas for land relinquished to transmigrants,
some of the irrgation scheme will be allocated to indigenous farmers
(Chapter 5).

Water Supply and Demand
2.05      Water for irrigation of the Sitiung II project area would be
diverted from the Batang Piruko and the Batang Siat. Discharges at the two
proposed diversion weirs have been obtained by correlation with flows in the
Batang Hari where records are available from March 1975. Average monthly
discharges at frequencies of 50% and 80% are shown in Table 2.1.

2.06      Some 1,100 ha would be developed under the Sitiung II project,
irrigated from the Batang Piruko river, increasing the area already
irrigated by pumping from 3,300 ha under Stage I, to 4,400 ha (see Annex 4,
Table 2). Demand and supply calculations are based on an overall water use
efficiency of 68% and on dependable water supplies from the Batang Piruko
(at 80% frequency) conveyed to the Stage I pumping plant on the Batang Hari.
Table 2 of Annex 4 lists demands for a 1:5 dry year and shows incremental
pumping required from the Batang Hari to meet water deficiencies in the Batang
Piruko during that year for two rice crops: a wet season crop grown during
SeptemberJanuary on 4,400 ha and a dry season rice crop grown during
February-July on 3,520 ha (80% of the service area). Annex 4, Table 3 gives
irrigation requirements of 6,700 ha to be irrigated using dependable supplies

from the Batang Siat for the same cropping pattern given above. The balance
of demand and supply is shown for Station BSD 30A on the main canal where
the water diverted and conveyed from the Batang Siat joins the main system.
As may be seen, supply exceeds demand except for the last third of September
and the first third of October in a 1:5 dry year. This small shortage would
be made up by pumped supply from the Batang Hari.
Existing Works
2.07      Sitiung II.  Work is well advanced on constructing the Stage I
system including a 5 cu m/sec pumping plant on the Batang Hari, and main,
secondary and tertiary canals to serve an area of about 3,300 ha. Works at
the pumping plant have been completed, and test pumping started in October
1981.
3. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01      The proposed project will comprise:  (a) construction of Stage II
of a Bank supported irrigation development at Sitiung, West Sumatra, to serve
about 7,600 ha which would also substitute gravity supplies for water
provided by a temporary pumping station for some 3,300 ha developed under
Stage I; (b) a river basin study for irrigation/drainage development at
Cisanggarung; (c) detailed design of the Jatigede Dam; (d) strengthening of
DGWRD's management information systems; (e) assisting the Institute of
Hydraulic Engineering (DPMA) to extend its hydrologic data network and data
processing; (f) expanding training programs for water users; and (g)

Service to upgrade financial control and auditing procedures.
Project Works
3.02      Sitiung Stage II will comprise construction of diversion systems on
the Batang Piruko and on the Batang Siat, ancillary conveyance and distribu-
tion networks to serve about 7,600 ha of which 6,700 ha will be developed
into rice fields (Map 1600 3R). The Batang Piruko system will comprise:
(a) a 10 km long access road to the diversion site;
(b) a masonry diversion weir and a concrete stilling basin;
(c)  a 17.5 km headrace conveyance canal for 7.5 cu m/sec (from
diversion to system headworks near the pumping plant built
under Stage 1) and related structures;
(d) canal structures and inter-farm networks for about 1,100 ha; and
(e) land clearing by contractors of about 420 ha and rice field
levelling and bunding by farmers on about 770 ha.



- 15 -
The Batang Siat system will comprise:
(a) a 3 km long access road to the diversion site;
(b) a masonry diversion weir, a concrete stilling basin and an earth
closure embankment;
(c)  a 24.5 km long headrace conveyance canal for 11.5 cu m/sec and
structures between the diversion weir and the Batang Siat main
canal;
(d) main, secondary canals, river crossing and canal structures north
and south of the Batang Siat to serve a total area of about
6,500 ha;
(e) design and construction of inter-farm irrigation networks
(tertiaries, quaternaries and drains) to serve the same 6,500 ha;
(f) land c:Learing by contract of about 1,400 ha and rice field
clearing, levelling and bundling by farmers of about 5,320 ha; and
3.03       Some 24 m/m of internationally recruited consulting services for
construction supervision of both the Batang Piruko and Batang Siat systems
will be provided.
3.04       In the combined service areas forming the Sitiung Stage II
subproject (7,600 ha) rice fields will cover 6,700 ha of which about 1,820 ha
have been previously cleared (at Batang Siat) by GOI for transmigrants and
about 610 ha has been cleared by indigenous farmers. The remainder (about
4,290 ha) will be cleared by farmers (about 2,470 ha) and by GOI (about 1,820
ha) as summarized in Table 3.1. Present land use is summarized in Table 5.2.

Status of Preparation
3.07      Sitiung II.  Detailed design and preparation of tender documents
has been completed for irrigation systems serving 7,600 ha. Design of the
two headrace canals of the Batang Piruko and Batang Siat systems are
substantially completed and should be finalized by April 1982. Investigations
and design of the two headworks are expected to be completed by June 1982.
3.08      Designs and Studies.  Terms of Reference for the Cisanggarung Basin

Implementation Schedule
3.09      The proposed implementation schedule (Figure 3.1) for Sitiung II
reflects the status of design work, GOI commitment to carry out the works in
1982/84, and good experience in the construction of first stage works. Major
contracts for the construction of headrace canals are expected to start in the
Fall of 1982, construction of headworks in January 1983. Land clearing will
be completed by contractors within three years, while farmers will clear and
develop (level and bund) the remaining lands for rice cropping as water is
delivered.
Consulting Services
3.10      DGWRD will continue to rely heavily on consultants for project
preparation and assistance in construction supervision. This is in line with
GOI's policy of limiting staff increases and encouraging the use and expansion
of local consulting services. Under the project, over 50% of professional
inputs for design and 100% of technical services for the management
information systems will be furnished by local consultants. Internationally
recruited consultants will be provided only for specialized training and
assisting PROSIDA staff and for the Cisanggarung studies, Jatigede design
and construction supervision of complex structures for which local expertise
is not yet available. Estimated schedules for consultants' assignments and
cost breakdowns are summarized in Table 3.2 and detailed in Annex 1, Tables 7
and 8.
3.11      Sitiung II.  Foreign consultants were engaged by GOI in association
with local consultants to supervise construction-of Stage I. The same
consultants (Sir M. MacDonald and Partners, UK) have been engaged to design
Stage II and will also assist PIBD in supervising construction of main works
and structures for Stage II. Additionally, local consultants will assist PIBD
in designing and supervising construction of tertiaries. The cost of local
services (on a per ha basis) is included in construction costs (Annex 1,
Table 2).
3.12      Design and Studies for Future Projects and Institution
Strengthening. Foreign consultants with the participation of local firms
will prepare master plan studies of the Cisanggarung River Basin and subject
to the results of an update of earlier feasibility studies of Jatigede Dam the
detailed design of Jatigede Dam. Foreign consultants would assist PROSIDA in
upgrading and expanding the training of water users, irrigation service staff
and agricultural extension agents, and DGWRD in improving collection and
processing of hydrologic data. Local consultants would assist DGWRD in
upgrading its management information systems and in improving financial
control and auditing procedures.

Cost Estimates
3.13      The estimated total project cost is $76.6 million, including
physical contingencies, expected price increases, and administration and taxes
on civil works (Table 3.3). The foreign currency component is estimated at
$34.5 million or about 45%. Costs are expressed in end 1981 prices and are
derived from adjusted costs of ongoing works and for Sitiung II on updated
bills of quantities and unit costs derived from Stage I work now nearing
completion. Estimated monthly base costs of local and foreign consultants are
$2,500 and $12,500 respectively for engineers and $1,000 for technicians and
draftsmen. Equipment costs are based on imports except for vehicles where tax
free costs of locally assembled vehicles have been used. Physical
contingencies of 15% have been added to all works and services except Sitiung
where 20% has been added. Estimated price increases have been calculated on
the basis of projected inflation rates: for local costs, 14% in 1982, 12% in
1983 and 10% thereafter; for foreign costs 8.5% in 1982 7.5% in 1983 to 1985
and 6% thereafter. Project costs are detailed in Annex 1, Tables 1, 5, 6 and
7.
Financing
3.14      The proposed Bank loan of $37 million would finance about 50% of
the estimated total project cost, exclusive of taxes ($2.3 million) and
reserve procurement ($0.1 million). The remaining $39.6 million (Rp 24.8
billion) would be provided by GOI annual budget appropriation.
Procurement
3.15      Civil Works.  Because of the remote location of the site and the
satisfactory performance of seven contractors presently completing Stage I
works (financed under Loan 1435-IND), it will be cost effective to procure
works by nationally advertised competitive bidding. Works have been grouped
in 11 packages comprising headworks, headrace canals of Batang Piruko and
Batang Siat; main and secondary canals as shown in Table 3.4. In addition
there would be a number of small contracts for tertiary construction, which
would also be procured by competitive bidding advertised locally. All works
will be tendered on the basis of standard contract documents agreed with the
Bank in September 1980, and procured in accordance with GOI procurement
procedures satisfactory to the Bank. All multiyear contracts will include
appropriate escalation clauses.

3.16      Equipment and Materials.  An estimated $4.0 million of equipment
will be purchased as detailed in Annex 1, Table 6 and summarized in
Table 3.5:

/a  Comprising 5 vehicles and 8 mobile training units
required for start up and to be procured under
consulting contracts. Eight other vehicles and 20
motorcycles will be procured by GOI locally and hence
are considered reserve procurement.
Hydrologic, climatologic and communication equipment (about $2.0 million)
would be procured under ICB. Local manufacturers would be granted a prefer-
ence of 15% of the c.i.f. price of imported goods, or the customs duty,
whichever is lower. The remaining equipment could not conveniently be grouped
into sufficiently large packages to attract international bidders, and would
be procured locally through GOI procurement procedures acceptable to the
Bank.
3.17      Review of Procurement.  Civil works and equipment will be procured
by the relevant DGWRD implementing agency. An independent but internal
control of all procurement is made by the DGWRD Secretariat, and larger
contracts ($800,000 and above) must also be cleared by the external State
Secretariat Procurement Control Unit (SEKNEG). These procurement controls
appear to be working efficiently. The Bank has delegated its supervision
responsibility to RSI, which works closely with DGWRD and the State
Secretariat on procurement matters. For civil works, the Bank will review
prior to tendering and award, nine contracts each of whose estimated cost
is equivalent to $1.5 million or above, in aggregate covering about 75% of
the value of civil works. Equipment contracts for about $2 million (about
50% of the total value of equipment furnished under this project) procured
through ICB will be reviewed by the Bank prior to tendering and award. The
remaining contracts will be reviewed by the Bank on a post award sample
basis.



- 24 -
Disbursements
3.18      Loan disbursements will be made against full documentation as
follows:
(a)  30% of total expenditures for civil works for the construction
of headworks and main irrigation systems of Sitiung II;
(b)  50% of total expenditures for civil works for DGWRD's manage-
ment information systems and of extension of DPMA's hydrologic
network;
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment and
100% of local expenditures (ex-factory prices) for locally
manufactured equipment and 65% of locally procured, off-the-
shelf items; and
(d) 100% of consultants costs.
3.19      Disbursements will be effected against quarterly statements of
expenditure at 100% of total expenditures for water user training, including
facilities, training materials, per diems and lecturer honorariums; and at
30% for tertiary networks at Sitiung II (Annex 6).
3.20      GOI will fund the remainder of project costs.  The schedule of
disbursements (Annex 1, Table 4) has been projected with the following
assumptions:
(a) implementation will proceed as set out in schedule, but may be
delayed by up to 12 months; and
(b) disbursements may be delayed by up to 12 months behind the pro-
jected implementation schedule.
Disbursements during the second, third and fourth years are expected to be
somewhat faster than indicated by the regional profile as they reflect the
advanced stage of preparation of the project, land acquisition for the
Sitiung II construction has started already and no problems are foreseen,
and the improving disbursement trends for previous loans (para. 1.20).
Accounts and Audits
3.21      The Bank has assisted PROSIDA and PIBD in establishing accounting
systems, and these, like the Project Cimanuk, follow government procedures.
Final accounts including balance sheets and consolidated receipts and
expenditures statements are prepared at the year end to satisfy Bank
requirements. Each accounting section is headed by a certified public



-25 -
accountant who reports monthly on budget and financial status. Internal audit
sections are responsible for visiting project sites quarterly and examining
local accounting records.
3.22      PROSIDA, PIBD and Project Cimanuk accounts are subject to audit by
the State Auditor (Directorate General of State Financial Control) which is
now using private auditors to clear a backlog of work. The state auditors'
short-form reports have so far analyzed income and costs, and checked that the
costs have been properly incurred according to budget allocations. No
long-form reports are prepared.
3.23      Although the accounting and auditing systems have provided
reasonable financial control for Bank supported projects, improvements are
desirable in timeliness 6f annual accounts and audits; and in systems of
internal control, especially for the reconciliation of assets with cumulative
expenditures and procedures for writing off assets. In addition, the State
Auditor should prepare long form reports following specific guidelines for
each agency to be reviewed with the Bank.
3.24      Consultant accountants will be employed to advise GOI on measures
to be taken in line with these recommendations and to review accounting and
financial control systems for all DGWRD agencies implementing Bank supported
projects. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that these agencies will
maintain separate accounts for each subproject; engage auditors acceptable to
the Bank to audit these accounts; and submit to the Bank, within nine months
of the close of each fiscal year, audited statements, together with the
auditors comments (para. 8.01c).
Environmental Impact
3.25      Irrigation development at Sitiung is the second phase of ongoing
agricultural development in the area involving land clearing and conversion to
rice paddies from scrub and secondary forest sometimes interspersed by rubber
trees. Displaced fauna will relocate to adjacent forested upland areas which
are extensive and likely to remain in their natural state for many years to
come. Intensive development of the 6,700 ha will have a minor effect on flora
when balanced against the vast natural forests surrounding the site. The use
of water from two small tributaries of the Batang Hari will have an equally
small effect on river hydrology or fauna in one of Sumatra's largest river
systems.



- 26 -
4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
4.01      Sitiung II.  The implementation of irrigation systems for Stage II
would be managed by PIBD's subproject manager and staff, assisted by foreign
and local consultants, following the completion of Stage I works scheduled
for the end of 1981. Land clearing will be the responsibility of the
Directorate of Highways (DGH), and levelling and bunding by farmers will
be supervised by DGFCA (para. 8.01g).
4.02      Studies, Designs and Water User Training.  Cisanggarung Basin
Studies would be carried out by consultants, and managed and supervised by
Project Cimanuk of DGWRD's Directorate of Rivers, which would also supervise
detailed design of Jatigede Dam. Training of water users would be
implemented by PROSIDA, using DGWRD's training units at Surabaya and Ujung
Pandang, and DGFCA's training unit at Cirebon. Lecturers will be drawn from
DGWRD, DGFCA and Ministry of Home Affairs staff (Figure 4.3).
Operation and Maintenance
4.03      Sitiung II.  Operation and maintenance of headworks, main and
secondary systems of the Sitiung irrigation development will be managed by
PIBD's O&M unit for two years following construction. Following this, the
provincial irrigation service will take over the system for routine O&M.
Tertiary systems will be operated and maintained by water users in each
tertiary block, who will receive instruction and guidance from the
agricultural extension service. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that GOI will allocate sufficient annual O&M funds and staff to operate and
maintain the main and secondary systems satisfactorily (para. 8.04).
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.04      Sitiung II.  PIBD will monitor the operation and maintenance of
physical components of the completed system during a period of at least two
years following completion of Stage II. This will include pumping from the
Batang Hari, gravity diversions at headworks and water delivered to secondary
and tertiary blocks. DGFCA will monitor seasonally cropped areas and
production for at least five years after system completion. Organization
and evaluation of the monitoring activities will be the responsibility of
the Evaluation Section, Directorate of Planning and Programming, which is
being strengthened with Bank assistance (Cr. 995-IND).

5. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Crop Production Changes
5.01      After the Sitiung II irrigation system is operational, farmers will
shift from present upland cropping of secondary food crops and rainfed rice to
irrigated rice. Changes in cropping patterns, cropping intensities, yields
and production are discussed below and summarized in Table 5.1 and in Annex 2.
5.02      Indigenous farmers in the Sitiung area are growing an annual
rainfed rice or secondary food crop under shifting cultivation. Typically
after two or three years cropping of each site, farmers plant forest rubber.
In addition farmers have developed lowland rice fields (sawah) on small
local areas adjacent to streams, sometimes using simple irrigation for a
single annual crop. Currently there are some 80 ha of sawah in the Sitiung
I area (3,300 ha) and some 230 ha in the 1,100 ha area to be newly supplied
from the Batang Piruko. In the area of 6,500 ha to be supplied from the
Batang Siat there is about 380 ha of sawah (Table 5.2). Indigenous farmers
typically depend on daily tapping of forest rubber, but rely on their sawah
for meeting family rice needs. Paddy yields are about 2.0 tons/ha, without
fertilizer.
5.03      About 1,800 transmigrant farmers, all experienced irrigated rice
growers from Central Java (para. 1.21), have been settled in the Sitiung II
area since 1976. Each family has been given 1 ha of uplands capable of
irrigation, which has been cleared by GOI, a 0.25 ha houselot and an addi-
tional area of 0.75 ha of uplands for future use outside the irrigation area.
Until irrigation becomes available the settlers are growing rainfed food
crops, especially upland rice, groundnut, maize and cassava. Present yields
are low (rice, 0.3 tons/ha; groundnut, 0.2 tons/ha; maize, 0.4 tons/ha; and
cassava, 2 tons/ha) because of poor soil fertility, exaggerated by extensive
removal of top soil during fully mechanized forest clearing.
5.04      Because of the present low yields, particular attention has been
paid to projecting likely production under irrigation from these soils.
Irrigation was introduced in the 1940s when the Mimpi irrigation system was
constructed to serve about 800 ha of similar land contiguous to the Sitiung
scheme. Unfortunately, there are no records of crop performance in early
years. Crop cutting trials over the last 5 years show average yields of
3.5 ton/ha of HYVs with proper fertilizers, and 3.0 tons for unfertilized long
duration local varieties./1 Random cutting trials, in May 1981 gave yields
ranging from 5 tons/ha to 10 tons/ha, in all cases on the most recently
developed land and for the 9th crop planted since sawahs were formed./2

Agricultural services was developed four years ago. Average paddy yields of
3.0-3.5 ton/ha of HYVs are obtained with fertilizer applications of 150 kg
urea and 90 kg TSP.
5.05      Since 1978, consultants engaged in the Sitiung II feasibility
studies carried out a series of crop trials on three sites in the project
area and in farmers' fields alongside, all irrigated by pumped supplies.
Despite occasional pump break downs, trials do provide useful evidence for
yield projections on newly irrigated land. The Piruko site has probably the
worst soil conditions since it was mechanically cleared and more top soil
removed. It is close to the Sitiung I transmigration village on fairly
sloping land. Results for HYVs with 200 kg/ha urea and 100 kg/ha TSP at the
Piruko Site are:
Year 1  1st crop ...... 2.0 tons/ha
2nd crop ...... 1.5 tons/ha
Year 2  3rd crop ...... 0.5 tons/ha (seriously affected by pests)
4th crop ...... 2.2 tons/ha
Year 3  5th crop ...... 2.5 tons/ha
5.06      The most important constraint for rice production is the poor
initial soil fertility, especially the low ph and low phosphate status.
Measurements in the Sitiung I area show that upon ponding of water a ph of
4.5 rises to about 5.0 and after a year or two, to around 6.0. During this
process, increasing amounts of humus are puddled into rice fields and
further assist nutrient holding capacity. Early rice yields are likely to
be depressed by the effects of low phosphate uptake and high iron/aluminum/
manganese levels., As the ph rises however, these effects will become much
less pronounced.
5.07      Following field visits and review of available data, conservative
yield estimates have been adopted. Different yield progressions may be
expected for the Batang Piruko area compared to the Batang Siat area where
mechanical clearing was restructed and where less top soil was removed.
Paddy yield projections are as follows:
Year     Batang Piruko   Batang Siat
------ tons/ha/crop ------
1            1.2             1.5
2            1.5             1.8
3           2.3              2.5
4            2.8             2.8

5.08      Extension service personnel are in place in each transmigrant
village, as are BRI credit branches and input suppliers.
5.09      Land clearing by GOI contractors is in progress and rice field
formation by farmers is scheduled to start when water becomes available.
Farmers have been organized into groups, and credit is available for their use
in sawah formation. One tertiary block will be levelled and funded by con-
tract as a demonstration for farmers in the Stage I area. A similar approach
will be adopted in the Batang Siat area. The earliest irrigation benefits are
expected from existing sawah, followed by the transmigrant lands which were
cleared already. Indigenous farmers are expected to more slowly develop their
existing upland fields into sawah, together with land being cleared for them
by GOI as compensation for land released to transmigrants. There is at
present about 240 ha of scrub (belukar) and 210 ha of secondary forest within
the service area of the Batang Piruko system, and 910 ha of scrub, 850 ha of
mixed primary and secondary forest, and 370 ha of "forest rubber" in the
Batang Siat service areas (Table 5.2). The forest land in the Batang Piruko
area will be cleared by GOI through contracts using chain saws and hand labor.
In the Batang Siat area it is estimated that all the scrub and secondary
forest will be cleared by GOI contracts, together with about half the mixed
primary/secondary forest. Indigenous farmers may further develop the
remaining 350 ha of mixed primary/ secondary forest at some time in the
future. They are, however, unlikely to clear the 370 ha of "forest rubber" in
the near term. Accordingly, it is assumed in the economic analysis that
800 ha of the 6,500 ha Batang Siat service area and 100 ha of 1,100 ha Batang
Piruko service area will remain undeveloped.

5.10      Cropping intensities will increase as land is cleared and formed
into sawahs. Farmers, especially the Wonogiri transmigrants, are anxious to
plant irrigated rice and cropping intensities of 180% to 185% are expected
within 10 years with a yield of about 3.0 tons/ha per crop (para. 5.07 and
(Table 5.3 and para.5.07).

Drying Storage and Processing
5.11       Both transmigrant and indigenous farmers in the project area are
experienced paddy growers. They sun-dry paddy on mats, and store dry paddy
in their houses. Small mills with good storage and drying floors are being
introduced progressively in transmigrant villages, where BUUD/KUDs are well
established. Indigenous villages are served already by small private mills,
which may be expected to expand as production grows.

6.  MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND PROJECT CHARGES
Market Prospects
6.01      Indonesia has been the largest rice importer in the world in the
last decade with imports ranging annually between 0.5 and 2.3 million tons.
Based on projected future production and demand the estimated rice deficit
will range between 2 and 3 million tons in 1990./1 There is likely to be
keen demand to increasing national rice output, which would substitute
present imports. Market prospects in the Sitiung area are especially good,
since the region is a rice deficit area and rice demand is growing rapidly
through nearby extensive land settlement and nucleus estate operations based
on tree crops.
6.02      The rice marketing system is well established and provides for
producer price support and consumer protection through intervention of
BULOG, the national food procurement agency. It procures 2-5% of national
rice output mostly via cooperatives (BUUD/KUD), and imports the equivalent
of about 10%. BULOG's support prices for rice and other food crops are
usually somewhat below average farmgate prices and it only buys when prices
are depressed.
Prices
6.03      Both farm inputs and outputs have been valued in terms of end 1981
currency values for farm budgets and economic analysis. Economic prices
for rice, soybeans, corn, groundnuts and fertilizers were based on world
market price forecasts produced by the Bank-s Commodity Division, adjusted
for transportation, processing and handling costs to the -farmgate level as
shown in Table 6.1. The remaining inputs not traded on the international
market have been expressed in terms of actual (farmgate) prices. The
economic price of farm labor has been valued at half of the actual price as
its shadow price (para. 7.03). All prices in the analysis are summarized in
Table 6.2. Rice produced under the project would substitute for Indonesian
imports of 25% broken quality rice. It has been shown that the world market
price for this quality of rice is about 90% of the standard 5% broken Thai
white rice price. Indonesia is now self-sufficient in corn and groundnuts,
and the economic prices have been calculated on the basis of export prices.

- 36 -
6.04      For years the Government has followed a low food price policy for
the protection of consumers, and has simultaneously subsidized farm inputs
such as fertilizers and pesticides for maintaining farmer's incomes. As a
result of this policy and the current and projected high prices at world
markets, there is a significant difference between financial (actual farmgate
level) and economic prices of both paddy and fertilizers. As shown in Table
6.2, the financial and economic prices of paddy are respectively Rp 105/kg
and Rp 191/kg at the end of 1981; and Rp 126/kg and Rp 230/kg in 1990.
Farm Incomes
6.05      Typical farm models for the Sitiung subproject area have been
used for farm income analysis. Average farm sizes assumed are 1.75 ha for
transmigrant farms and 4.0 ha for indigenous farms. It has been assumed
that the farm family performs all farm work; hires labor in peak seasons
(harvesting) and is employed on off-farm works during slack seasons.
Financial prices of all farm inputs and outputs have been used in farm
budgets which include all incurred production costs except unpaid farm
family labor. Details of estimated farm incomes for these typical farms are
presented in Table 6.3 and in Annex 2, Table 2.

6.06      In the Sitiung II subproject both indigenous and transmigrant farm
families would substantially improve their incomes. Per capita incomes of
indigenous farmers are estimated at $110 without the project, increasing to
$185 with the project. Similarly transmigrant farmers per capita incomes
are estimated at $71 without the project and $142 with the project. Per



- 37 -
capita incomes are much lower than the national per capita income of $360 as:
of 1980./l The current estimate of absolute poverty income in Indonesia is
$112 per capita per year rising to about $134 by 1990. More than 90% of the
benefitting farm families of the project are rural poor.
Project Charges
6.07      IPEDA.  Farmers in Indonesia pay a national land tax (IPEDA) and
water charges or irrigation service contributions. IPEDA is collected by
the village head and turned over to local and provincial administrations
public services. IPEDA is assessed as a percentage of crop production.
Transmigrant farmers in Sitiung will be expected to pay IPEDA of about
$16/ha (Rp 10,000/ha) when their land is fully developed and the project is
transferred from central to local government.
6.08      Water Charges.  Water charges are collected by water users
associations and are earmarked for operation of the irrigation system below
the secondary turnouts (i.e., tertiary and quaternary canals and drains).
The level of charges varies from place to place and averages some 25 kg of
paddy per ha for each cropping season. This amount is sufficient to pay for
the services of a ditchrider (ulu-ulu) and where applicable, his assistants;
sometimes ditchriders receive a plot of village-owned land in lieu of
charges. Water charges of $10/ha (Rp 6,300/ha) per year are expected to be
collected.
6.09      Cost Recovery.  The direct cost recovery index, which is the ratio
of the present value of incremental revenue (IPEDA and water charges) to the
present value of incremental financial costs of the project, is estimated at
4%. However, the indirect cost recovery index, which is derived from
government savings for rice procurement/2 is about 106%.
/1 Although comparisons of farm income based on farm budgets with income
data based on national accounts must be interpreted with caution they
are an approximation of the relative poverty of project beneficiaries.
/2 Without projects, GOI would have to import rice at a price equivalent to
$356/ton in 1985 as paddy while with project it could procure paddy
domestically at a substantially low price of $195/ton resulting in a
gross saving of $161/ton. This is equivalent to a net saving of about
$142/ton, after netting out government subsidies for fertilizers and
agro-chemicals, which could be considered an indirect cost recovery from
project farmers.



- 38 -
6.10      Taking into account both direct and indirect cost recovery,
farmers in the Sitiung project area would contribute as much as $620/ha per
year to government with a total cost recovery index as high as about 110%.
On average, farmers would pay about 12% of their net profits (project rent)
for IPEDA and water charges. This level is considered reasonable because
most of the beneficiaries, especially transmigrants, are poor. Table 6.4
indicates in detail these rent recovery and cost recovery indices.

7. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Project Benefits and Beneficiaries
7.01      The Sitiung II project would increase food crop production,
employment opportunities, government savings, and reduce rural poverty.
About 36,000 tons of paddy would be produced annually. About 38,000 people
or 7,000 families would benefit directly, while about 1,000 families of
landless laborers would benefit indirectly. Civil works would generate some
21 million man-days of construction labor. The project would create a
demand about 2 million man-days of farm labor each year equivalent to about
6,000 additional full-time jobs. More than 90% of project farmers are rural
poor, and would increase their family income by about 150-200%. GOI would
save foreign exchange of about $20 million annually by reducing rice
imports. Investment costs per benefitting family to achieve these benefits
are about $4,500,in line with normal costs for construction of a new
irrigation system.
Major Assumptions Used in Economic Analysis
7.02      Direct Tangible Benefits.  Incremental production generated by the
project is valued in economic prices (at end-1981 constant dollars) net of
incremental production costs, including farm-family labor. Savings of
pumping costs for Sitiung's Stage I as gravity supplies become available
under the project, are considered economic benefits generated by the
project. Table 7.1 summarizes these benefits.

- 40 -
7.03      Labor Pricing.  In the transmigration area employment opportunities
are extremely limited. Most opportunities at present are provided by
constructing the Sitiung Stage I irrigation systems, which are almost
completed. As a result, farm wages are low, averaging about Rp 700 per
man-day; economic wages have consequently been assessed at about 50% of
market values (Rp 350 per man-day) as for similar Bank-assisted projects in
Indonesia./1
7.04      Foreign Exchange.  The present official exchange rate of US$1.00
Rp 625 is considered to reflect the value to the economy of the foreign
exchange used in constructing the project and saved through increased grain
production. A standard conversion factor of 1.0 has therefore been used.
7.05      Development Period.  The Sitiung II subproject is expected to be
fully developed 8 years after completion of the irrigation system.
7.06      Economic Life.  A 30-year economic life is assumed.
7.07      Economic Cost.' In calculating economic returns physical contingen-
cies have been included in economic costs. Labor costs have been shadow
priced in labor intensive civil works. The total economic construction cost
of the project is estimated at US$24 million (Rp 15 billion) at end-1981
prices, and following construction, annual O&M costs of $34,000 have been
included throughout the project life. Table 7.2 summarizes both the capital
(financial) and economic costs of the Sitiung project during the construction
phase.

Economic Rates of Return (ERR)
7.08      Using the foregoing assumptions the economic rates of return are
calculated at 18% for Sitiung II as a whole and 20% and 17% for the Batang
Piruko and Batang Siat systems respectively. Economic costs and benefits
and their present values are summarized in Annex 2, Table 4.
Sensitivity Analysis
7.09      Crossover values /1 for a 10% discount rate were calculated for a
number of variables crucial to the success of the project. The greater the
difference between the crossover and appraisal values the less sensitive the
ERR is to the tested variable. Table 7.3 summarizes the differences between
the crossover and appraisal values for a number of variables and their
combinations in the project area. Because the Batang Piruko system is largely
independent of the Batang Siat system, it is analyzed separately.
/1 The crossover value is the value of the variable tested for which the
project's net present value calculated at 10% discount rate is zero, or
equivalently the value beyond which the ERR would be below 10%, the
critical level for economic viability of the project.



- 42 -
7.10      ERRs of the two systems are not sensitive to cost over-runs.
An increase of total investment costs up to 140% of Batang Piruko and UD to
120% for Batang Siat would be required to reduce the ERR's to 10%.
Similarly, the total benefit streams would have to decrease by about 50%
holding other assumptions constant, to reach the same result. Incremental
paddy yields would have to drop by 49% to lower the ERR to Batang Siat to
10%, while the Batang Pirako incremental yields would have to fall by 70%
to reduce the ERR to 10%, because of the importance of cost savings for
pumping in this system. Only a catastrophic drop in the world price of rice
may jeopardize ERRs. A delay on construction completion or materialization
of the benefit streams by 7.0 years would not jeopardize the economic
viability of the project. Finally in a worst combination of these
variables, assuming a 3-year delay of entire benefit streams, the ERR would
still remain at 10% as long as paddy yields would attain 3.5 tons per
hectare. The results of these analyses show that the Sitiung project
components are economically viable even under adverse conditions.
Risks
7.11      The project does not entail major risks.  Very high cost over-runs,
higher than experienced in the past, and very long delavs would have to occur
to render the project unattractive. The development of Sitiung II, though
clearly depending on increasing the soils initial low productivity, is
supported by encouraging results from the contiguous Mimpi irrigation project
developed before World War II, and cropping trials in the area. The risk is
small considering GOI commitment to support Javanese farmers resettled in

8. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with GOI on the
following:
(a)  GOI will employ consultants for the following subprojects by the
dates below:
Subproject                                  Latest Date
Sitiung II                                  August 1, 1982
DGWRD Management Systems                    January 1, 1983
Water User Training                         April 1, 1983
Financial Control Systems                   January 1, 1983
Consultants will be employed also for Hydraulic Data Colletion
and Processing, Cisanggarang River Basin study and the Jatigede
Detailed Design. The qualifications, experience and terms and
conditions of employment of consultants would be satisfactory to the
Bank, and their employment would be made in accordance with
principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of
"Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and
the World Bank as Executing Agency," published by the Bank in August
1981 (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.02).
(b)  GOI will provide adequate funds for and take action as necessary
to acquire in the year preceding construction all land and rights
in respect of land required for the construction and operation of
the facilities included in the project and in all other Bank
supported irrigation projects (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.05).
(c) DGWRD, PROSIDA, PIBD, Proyek Cimanuk and Proyek Hydrologi will:
(i) maintain records adequate to reflect operations, resources
and expenditures in respect of each part of the Project
including separate accounts and records for statements of
expenditure, and maintain such records until at least one
year after the Closing Date;
(ii) have such accounts and financial statements for each fiscal
year, and statements of expenditure audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank;



- 45 -
(iii) furnish to the Bank not later than nine months after the end
of each fiscal year, (A) certified copies of its financial
statements and (B) audit reports of such scope and in
such detail as the Bank shall have reasonably requested
(draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.02).
(d) GOI would:
(i) cause all facilities rehabilitated or constructed under the
project and all other irrigation projects assisted by the
Bank to be adequately operated and maintained, and would
ensure the efficient use of the water made available for
agricultural development and operations;
(ii) ensure that adequate staff are employed and funds allocated
for the proper operation and maintenance of the irrigation
systems and that by August 15 in each fiscal year, provide
liquid funds equal to but not less than half the amount
budgetted for operation and maintenance during the FY and
the balance in equal quarterly installments;
(iii) progressively increase the number of qualified operation and
maintenance staff until adequate staff levels, established in
consultation with the Bank, have been attained; and
(iv) inform the Bank by May 1 of each year, of the approved budgets
for O&M of irrigation systems; and by October 1, of the staff
provisions made (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.03).
(e) GOI would:
(i) before the design phase for the construction of any tertiary
network, ensure that water-user associations participate in
the planning of such networks; and
(ii) during the design phase for any tertiary network exchange
views with water-users associations to ensure that the members
agree with the objectives and operating procedures and
thereafter operate and maintain the networks (draft Loan
Agreement, Section 4.04).
(f) GOI would:
(i) comprehensively consider the duties and responsibilities
of the Ministry of Agriculture-s extension services, DGWRD
provincial irrigation services, the Ministry of Home Affairs
and its local administration for establishing, training and
assisting water-user associations; and



- 46 -
(ii) not later than July 1, 1983 furnish to the Bank for comments,
the findings and recommendations thereby obtained and promptly
thereafter cause the agency or agencies selected on the basis
of such review to undertake the training and support of the
wateruser associations taking into account the comments made
by the Bank (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.05).
(g)  By April 1983, DGH will implement land clearing for about 1,800 ha
at the Sitiung II project, and promptly after irrigation water
is supplied to each part of the project, the DGFCA will organize,
supervise and provide credit for clearing, levelling and bunding
about 2,500 ha, and levelling and bunding about 3,600 ha of the
irrigation area (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.06).
(h)  GOI would ensure that sufficient liquid funds will be made
available to PROSIDA, PIBD, DGH, DGFCA, Proyek Cimanuk and Project
Hydrologi not later than May 1 of each year for the ensuing GOI
fiscal year to cover budgeted expenditures for the project (draft
Loan Agreement, Section 3.01).
8.02      With the above assurances, the project would be suitable for a Bank
loan of $37 million, with a 20 year maturity, including a grace period of 5
years. The Borrower would be the Republic of Indonesia.
8.03      A Condition of Loan Effectiveness will be that at least one of the
two contracts for construction of the Batang Piruko headrace canal in the
Sitiung II subproject has been tendered, evaluated, and the notice of award
issued by the Project Manager (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.01).

1.        The target area of the training program consists of the cropped
areas for which tertiary systems have been constructed or rehabilitated under
Bank loans.
2.        The ultimate beneficiary population is estimated to be 11 million
rural people consisting of about 2.0 million farm families some 780,000 ha.
3.        GOI operates and maintains the main irrigation works and distri-
bution systems to the secondary turnouts. Water users with support from
local officials and local government operate and maintain the tertiary
systems. Insufficient understanding at the local level hampers cooperative
effort to operate and maintain the systems effectively. Deterioration of
the system; siltation, damage to gates and turnouts, canal breaks and leaks
results in unreliable, untimely and inequitable distribution of water. The
result is poor use of water and reduced crop yield.
4.        There is a need for a clear, consistent understanding of system
operation and maintenance among the various local officials and groups.
These include the local level officials stemming from DGFCA (PPLs -
Agricultural extension agents), DGWRD (Jurus - water master, ulu ulu's -
ditch riders), ASDO (Agricultural Subdistrict Officers), Ministry of
Interior (Lurahs - village chiefs), P3As (representatives of Water User
Associations), and Key Farmers and village leaders.  To date no effective
training program has been directed to the problems of operation and
maintenance of tertiary and inter-farm water distribution systems. Training
subject matters would deal with soil-water-crop relationships, irrigation
timing, turn-out and ditch maintenance, cooperative organization and
mobilization of resources for maintenance.
5.        The BIMAS program and the agricultural extension services deliver
a package program of improved seeds, fertilizer practices, pesticides,
farming and irrigated crop practices to farm groups, which may or may not
coincide with water user associations. It works directly with farmers and
does not directly address the problem of water distribution, system
organization, and operation and maintenance. Training by the Jatiluhur
Authority trains three separate target audiences, irrigation personnel, water
user association representatives, and key farmers. The courses do not
include PPLs, (extension agents) nor Lurahs (village chiefs), and results
have not been yet been evaluated.

6.        The training objective is a unified understanding of operation and
maintenance of inter-farm water distribution systems among the local personnel
of Agriculture, Irrigation and Local Government, and the water user
associations and key farmers. Three target audiences for training are
identified:
7.        Target Group A are middle level (district or subprovincial)
officials of Agriculture, Ministry of Interior (Kabupaten) and Irrigation
personnel. These would include Extension Supervisors and subject matter
specialists, district officers and selected staff and irrigation section
chiefs. The purpose or training objective for this groups is to acquaint
them with the program, secure their participation and suggestions, and to
enlist their support and commitment to the training program of target groups
2 and 3. The format of the course would be similar, with structured dis-
cussions aimed at finding solutions to problems of tertiary irrigation
system operation and maintenance. Training duration is envisaged as one
week in groups not to exceed 20. Total target group is 6,000 and 30% would
receive training which would be completed within the first 1-1/2 years of the
project.
8.        Target Group B consists of representatives of water user
associations (12,000) and lower level and local government staff as
follows:
a.  PPLs (Agric. extension Agents)                   900
b.  ASDOs (Agric. Subdistrict Officers)              300
c.  Lurahs (village chiefs)                        2,000
d.  Juru's (subsection water masters)              1,200
e.  Ulu-ulu's (canal patrolmen)                    2,000
6,400
Plus P3A representatives                     12,000
18,400
9.        Because two thirds of the group are P3As (WUA Representatives)
enrollment of P3As would be limited to 40% of course enrollment in the
common courses, to attain course balance. A typical course composition
would be as follows:
PPLs    ASDOs    Lurahs    Juru's       Ulu-ulu's    P3As       Total
3        1         7         4            7           15         37

10.       In a four year project, which is a time-slice of an ongoing
program, with the resources envisaged some 6,200 officials and IUA Reps would
receive training. Year one will be largely devoted to construction,
procurement and instructor training but several pilot courses would be held.
The training objective is to establish a clear understanding of the
requirements and methods for inter-farm irrigation system operation and
maintenance and the roles and functions which each group would fulfill. The
training would be conducted from mobile training units with extensive use of
audio-visual media prepared for this purpose. Training format would employ
lecture, reference materials, group discussion and local field trips as well
as A/V materials.
11.       Target Group C consists of about 80,000 key farmers and village
leaders (4% of the 2,000,000 rural families). In a four-year time-slice about
6,700 of this group would receive three seeks of training. The training
objective would be to establish a clear understanding of the need for
effective operation and maintenance of their inter-farm irrigation systems
and the methods and resources required to carry out O&M. Training would be
held at 11 training centers by especially trained instructors. Training
format would use lectures, demonstrations, discussions, local field trips and
multi-media audio-visual materials prepared on this subject.
12.       The project would be implemented by PROSIDA under the general
direction of DGWRD with the Project Manager and small central staff in
Jakarta. A steering committee with representation from Agriculture-DGFCA,
Interior-DGRD and Public Works-DGWRD would be established. Three subproject
managers would be located in Surabaya, Cirebon and Ujung Pandang each of
which would have a training site and one or more satellite training sites or
training centers.  There would be a total of eleven training sites, of which
eight would be satellite training centers. Each subproject would have a 300
sq m office and service facility. Each training site would have a 380 sq m
training facility consisting of a classroom, dormitory, food service, office,
and storage with a capacity of 40 trainees. A total of 5,380 sq m of civil
works would be constructed.  Each training site would consist of a chief, a
training officer, 6 instructors (of whom 3 would operate the MTU), and
administrative and support personnel.
13.       In addition to its ongoing media development task, the Audio-Visual
Training Project (PLAV) in Surabaya assisted by consultants would assume
responsibility for training and instructors (80) and training officers (20)
required to implement the program. Instructors and training officers would
be selected from middle level officers of DGFCA, DGWRD, DGRD and possibly
Education. They would be assigned full time to the project for a year or
more of duty. In addition to instructor training, PLAV would prepare
training materials for the project, provide advisory services and using
audio-visual techniques would hold prior training courses for irrigation

personnel in East, Central and West Java, Sulawesi and West Sumatra as the
third phase of PLAV activities. The Surabaya subproject will be located
adjacent to Diklat IV and work in collaboration with its staff. It is also
adjacent to PLAV.
