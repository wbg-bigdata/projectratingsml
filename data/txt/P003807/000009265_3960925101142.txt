SIXTEENTH IRRIGATION PROJECT (IANJ 2118-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
P-REr'ACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Sixteenth
Irrigation Project in Indonesia, for which Loan 2118-IND in the amount of
US$37 million was approved on March 30, 1982.   The loan was closed on
December 13, 1988, one year behind schedule.  The last disbursement took
place on July 27, 1989.
The PCR was prepared by the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programme
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III).   On August 8, 1989, the
Bank sent the Borrower Parts I and III with the request to prepare Part II
by September 26, 1989, but none was received.
'.his PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the
Loan, Guarantee and Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

INDONESIA
SIXTEENTH IRRIGATION PROJECT (LOAN 2118-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       The World Bank has been lending for irrigation projects in
*ndonesia for almost 20 years.  During that period, twenty-one loans were
made for irrigation, and two for swamp reclamation, providing a total of
some $1.5 billion to GOI. This PCR is for the Sixteenth Irrigation Project
which consisted of an irrigation project, and several other components.
Implementation Experience
2.       Construction of the Sitiung II Irrigation system was generally
slow due partly to lack of local funding. The Piruko and Siat headworks
and headrace canals were completed behind schedule and areas brought under
irrigation to date at about 2,300 ha have been far less than originally
planned because of delay in land clearing and development and tertiary
constructions.   Indigenous farmers were generally reluctant to eradicate
their rubber and perennial trees so long as they were income-generating.
In areas where irrigation was provided farmers were not knowledgeable about
proper water management practices and this, in conjunction with high
demands from the porous sandy loam soils, caused high water use and
resulted in shortages of water at the tail-end of the completed tertiaries.
3.       The water users' training program started slowly due to delay in
signing the foreign consultants' contract, but later accelerated after the
cooperation of officials from local government and other ministries had
been ensured. It has proved useful in solving problems related to opera-
tion and maintenance of tertiary canals.
4.       The strengthening of DGWRD management information system experi-
enced difficulties due to lack of clear definition of the objectives, the
inexperience of the local consultant, and the difficulty of establishing
DGWRD's requirements. However, after considerable pressure and assistance
from the Bank, five systems have been established.
5.       The implementation of the remaining aspects of the project pro-
ceeded generally satisfactorily.
Results
6.       The SAR had assumed that the benefits accruing from the construc-
tion of Sitiung II irrigation system would be the incremental agricultural



production from 6,700 ha and the saving in the cost of pumping water to
Stage I area of 3,300 ha.
7.       In actual fact,  the pumping station stopped working in 1986
because the pumps were damaged, largely due to pumping silty and sandy
water. They were repaired using funds for the Sitiung II project. The re-
estimation of the ERR for the Sitiung II component in the PCR is therefore,
based on the assumption that without the project the pumps would not have
been repaired and that all incremental agricultural production is, there-
fore, due to the project. As such, the results are not strictly comparable
with the SAR estimates.   Nevertheless, the ERR, which has been recalcu-
lated, is now estimated to be only 4% and is substantially less than 18X
estimated at appraisal. This is due to lower economic price for rice, cost
overruns and slower build-up of benefits.
Sustainability
8.       It is doubtful whether the Sitiung II (and Sitiung I) project as
originally planned will ever fully develop. About 8,000 ha do not yet have
tertiary development and it is no longer GOI policy to finance tertiary
development. If the development of the project area is completed, the risk
is that the irrigation system will not be adequately maintained and there
may be insufficient flow supplies for the area served.   To augment the
water supply by pumping, substantial budget would be required to operate
and maintain the pumping station and also to maintain a silt-free intake
channel.
Findings and Lessons Learned
9.       The concept of the project and its components were not clearly
defined before appraisal and in fact the major Sitiung II component was
added to the project at appraisal. As a result, it appears that a large
number of incompletely prepared components were packaged together in the
project.   Thus, if project preparation and appraisal are unduly rushed,
there are risks of the project being unsuccessful.
10.      For reasons of institutional expediency,  the only implementing
agency was DGWRD. The Sitiung II project indicates that involvement of the
Department of Agriculture in irrigation projects, and allocation of loan
funds for land development activities, particularly where there is newly
developed land, is essential if the project is to be successful.
11.      Institutional support components such as the strengthening of
DGWRD MIS require detailed preparation. This is most likely to be achieved
if it is insisted that a full description of the objectives and methods are
included in the SAR.   This was done for the hydrology and water users'
training components which were successfully implemented but not for the MIS
which had limited success.
12.      Delays in the start of consultancies might be avoided if it is a
condition of loan effectiveness that consultants' contracts have been
signed, instead of consultants having been appointed.

2'. Backgrounld
2.1      In  the  early  1980s,  Indonesia's drive towards achieving greater
self-sufficiency in food  supply  focussed  on  increasing  rice  production
through   greater  use  of  fertilizers;  better  pest-resistant  varieties;
expanded  extension  and  research   services;   continued   upgrading   and
rehabilitation of existing irrigation systems and construction of tertiary
networks, drainage and flood protection works; and constructing a series of
dams to provide dry season irrigation water, hydropower, and flood control.
Indonesia had about 4 million ha under irrigation. Over the last few years,
Indonesia had initiated each year the rehabilitation and upgrading of about
100,000 ha of existing irrigation systems, construction of about 50,000 ha
of new systems, and installation of river control, flood protection arnd
swamp reclamation works to improve about 130,000 ha of agricultural land.
2.2      Extensive use was being made of foreign assistance  for  the  large
irrigation  improvement  programme, especially from the Bank Group which had
until 1981 made available US$757.5 million through 15 loans and credits for
irrigation and one loan for swamp reclamation. The Bank had an important
role in irrigation policy, setting standards for studies, engineering design
and construction, and in assessing investment priorities. Increasingly Bank
assistance had emphasized institutional building, particularly of the
Directorate-General of Water Resources (DGWRD). For the Sixteenth Irrigation
Project, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) requested Bank Group assistance
for further strengthening DGWRD; water users training (WUT); for studies
and engineering design of two major sub-projects in Central and West Java
for future construction (Cisanggarung and Jatigede); and for extending
irrigation systems to serve about 6,700 ha at Sitiung, which straddles the
boundary between West Sumatra and Jambi Provinces.



- 2-
2.3      This  report  was  prepared  by  the  FAO/World  Bank   Coopprntive
Programme (FAO/CP) on the basis of a PCR prepared by DGWRD and a mission to
Indonesia in March 1989.
3. Project ObieLtives and Description
3.1      Obiectives.  The  project's  objectives  included: constructing the
Sitiung II irrigation system; institution strengthening; establishing a
technically and economically feasible viable means to control floods in the
coastal area of the Cisanggarung Basin and addressing water shortages in the
basin during the dry season; addressing the important policy issue of the
role of water users associations (WUAs) and making a clear definition of
responsibility amongst the several government agencies working with such
associations.
3.2      The project was to assist the GOI to  progressively  introduce  and
improve computer-based budget procedures and systems which would clearly
identify annual and multi-year budget commitments for projects under
construction, proposed new projects, and proposed sources of funding.
3.3      Project Description. The project would comprise construction of the
second stage of the Sitiung irrigation system in Sumatra to provide a
gravity-fed   supply   of  irrigation  water  to  serve  about  6,700 ha  of
transmigrant and local farmer lands: this supply would also supersede a
pumped supply for 3,300 ha constructed under the first stage; improvement of
management information systems of the DGWRD; training and support for water
users and their associations; exoansion of DGWRD's basic hydrological data
network; studies for development of the Cisanggarung River Basin and
detailed design of the Jatigede Dam.
4.  Proiect Design and Organization
4.1      The Sitiung II component, which was based on feasibility studies by
foreign consultants, was not well formulated. Risks foreseen by an FAG/CP
review mission in September 1980 included the high capital cost of the
project at around US$6,200/ha, while the benefits from growirg rice on
unsuitable soils would be low. While many transmigrants would persevere with
rice growing if inputs were provided free, most indigenous families would
probably continue to tap rubber for higher financial rewards and not
cultivate rice. FAO/CP considered the best approach would be to include the
area as part of a rubber project. Even if all land was brought under
irrigation within five years of water being available, FAO/CP estimated that
the ERR would be only about 6X. These forecasts, which have been shown to be
broadly correct,<1> were not supported in the SAR which said that GOI and
transmigrants strongly preferred irrigated rice tc rubber. The Bank did not
finance  land  clearing  and  levelling<2>  and had insufficient leverage to
ensure that this was done so that benefits from irrigation could be realized
soon after completion of irrigation facilities.
<1>      Actual cost US$5,800/ha. ERR 4X if the whole area is developed.
<2>      1,800 ha (1 ha/family) was cleared for transmigrants in 1977-1979
and a similar area was to be cleared by GOI for indigenous farmers.
Land levelling was to be farmers responsibility.



4.2      The concepts for the study and  design  components  were  generally
satisfactory.  The  strengthening  of OGWRD's management information systems
was not adequately thought out and, whereas an experienced consultant might
have been able to establish DGWRD's needs and design suitable systems, this
did not turn out to be the case due to the inexperience of the appointed
consultant.
4.3      More  attention was given at appraisal to collection and processing
of hydrological data and water users training (WUT). Upgrading of financial
control and auditing procedures was not thought through and agreed with GOI.
This component was eventually dropped at GOI's request.
5. Proiect Implementation

below:

5.2      Sitiung Ji.  The main change from the  appraised  project  was  the
increase from 1,100 ha to 2,400 ha in the incremental area to be irrigated
from the Batang Piruko (see Map ). This made it necessary to build an
additional diversion weir on the Palangko River to augment the water supply
from the Piruko. Rehabilitation of the six pumps in the Sitiung I Batang
Hari pumping station became necessary: three pumps were repaired under the
project and parts were imported for the other three pumps.
5.3      The main reason for the increase in area commanded  by  the  Batang
Piruko system was the need to provide irrigation to areas of sawah that were
spontaneously developed in flat land in valley bottoms along the headrace
canal. DGWRO considered it preferable to build proper offtakes from the
headrace canal rather than risk illegal ufftakes which could cause serious
damage.
5.4      Constructijn  progress  was  generally  slow  due partly to lack of
funds. In order  to  alleviate  domestic  budget  constraints,  disbursement
percentages were increased in 1986 and additional finance was provided under
the Irrigation Sub- sector Project (ISSP, Loan 2880-IND) to complete parts
of the project. The closing date of the loan was postponed one year to
permit completion of 70% of the main system and a part of the tertiary
system.
5.5      The  Piruko headworks and headrace canal were commissioned in early
1986, about nine months behind the appraisal estimate. This enabled
irrigation to continue without using the pumps but only about 1,800 ha were
ready for irrigation. The main and secondary canals are now complete but
only about 2,500 ha can be irrigated from the Piruko because land clearance
(2,500 ha), land development (2,800 ha) and tertiary development (3,000 ha)



- 4 -
have not been completed. The Siat headworks and headrace canal are complete
and the first 1,600 ha are expected to be irrigated in 1989. The rate at
which future land clearance, land development and tertiary development take
place is discussed in paras 6.4 and 6.5.
5.6      By financing the pump rehabilitation, the Bank has taken  one  step
towards enabling double-cropping in the Piruko area. However, unless a means
is found of desilting the intake channel and keeping it clear, the projected
high cropping intensity will not be sustainab'le over the whole area.
5.7      Development  of  the  project  area  for  cropping  was  slow. Land
clearing, levelling and bunding was delayed because no funds were provided
by the project and there was no provision of credit to farmers. Some
tertiaries were completed ahead of land development, but others were delayed
due to slow land development and lack of interest of indigenous farmers.
Farmers are generally reluctant to eradicate their rubber or perennial trees
so long as they are income-generating. This was not taken into account at
appraisal.
5.8      Farmers  were  not  knowledgeable  about  proper  water  management
practices and this, in conjuction with high demands from the porous sandy
loam soils, caused high water use and resulted in shortages of water at the
tail end in a number of areas.
5.9      Involvement   of   agricultural  institutions,  in  particula;-  the
Departments of Agriculture and Cooperatives, was minimal during the project
period. There were no agricultural staff in the project office. Agricultural
data were compiled by the water master. In many areas, farmers complained of
unavailability or untimely supply of fertilizers, widespread damage by brown
plant-hoppers and rats and lack of credit to purchase essential inputs.
5.10     Project  risks  were  not  fully  appreciated  at  appraisal.   The
reluctance of farmers to cut down forest rubber, the slow progress of land
clearing and land levelling due partly to lack of GOI budget, the difficulty
of keeping the pumping station intake free of silt, and the high maintenance
costs associated with this, although foreseeable (see para 4.1 above), were
not realistically assessed at appraisal.
5.11     The Cisanagaruna River Basin study proceeded generally according to
plan with no major change. The resulting feasibility report recommended two
new dams, the raising of one dam and river improvements on the Bangkaderis
and Crucuk Rivers.
5.12     Jatigede  Dam  Detailed  Design.  Following   completion   of   the
feasibility  study  financed  under  Irrigation XIII  (Loan  1691-IND),  the
detailed design was completed as proposed in the SAR. Additional studies of
environmental effects, reservoir operation and resettlement were made.
5.13     Strengthening  DGWRD  MIS  experienced  difficulties due to lack of
clear definition of the objectives, the inexperience of the local consultant
and the difficulty of establishing DGWRD's requirements. However, after
considerable pressure and assistance from the Bank, five systems were
established.
5.14     Collection  and  orocessing  of  hvdrological  data  were generally
implemented satisfactorily.



5.15     Water users  trainina started slowly due to delay  in  signing  the
foreign   consultants  contracts.  Although  the  work  star.ed,  until  the
contract  was  signed  the  lack  of  official   sanction   restricted   the
availability of funds for travelling. Initially, obtaining the cooperation
of officials from local government and other ministries and then receiving
their approval to the content of the training courses took time. Once the
good  results  of  the  training  became  known,  obtaining  the   necessary
cooperation and approvals became much quicker. Further WUT continues under
the ISSP.
5.16     Uoarading of financial control and auditing grocedures waw  deleted
from the project after the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) decided to review
accounting systems throughout the Ministry, making a seDarate study of DGWRD
systems unnecessary.
5.17     Mangower  develogment olannina was added to the project to initiate
and guide the implementation of manpower planning (prepared under an earlier
consultancy) in selected units of OGWRD.
6. Project Results
SitiunQ II
6.1       Introduction.  The  project  comprised  the  second  stage  of  the
development of irrigation for the Sitiung area. Under the first stage, which
was not yet complete at the start of this project, 3,300 ha were to be
irrigated by pumping water from a temporary pumping station on the Batang
Hari. The second stage was to irrigate a further 6,700 ha by gravity from
tributaries of the Batang Hari which would also replace the pumped supply to
3,300 ha of Stage I. The SAR assumed the benefits would be the incremental
agr:cultural production on 6,700 ha and the saving in cost of pumping for
3,300 ha.
6.2         In '1986,  the  pumping station stopped working because the pumps
were damaged, largely due to pumping silty and sandy water. The pumps were
repaired using funds from the Sitiung II project. For the purpose of re-
estimating the ERR of Sitiung II, this PCR is based on the assumption that
without the project the pumps would not have been repaired and that all
incremental agricultural production is therefore due to Stage II.
6.3      Since the PCR has estimated  tne  effect  of  the  project  on  the
combined  areas  of  Stage I  and  Stage II,  the  results  are not strictly
comparable with the SAR estimates. It can be argued that GOI would have
replaced the pumps even without Sitiung II and the ERR for this scenario has
also been estimated.
6.4      Due to the slow  rate  of  development  of  irrigation  (only  some
2,300 ha  <1>  of  the  12,300 ha  in  the project area have so far received
irrigation), it is difficult to predict accurately the eventual results of
the project, particularly concerning the rate of land development and
tertiary construction and the willingness of farmers to convert existing
mixed forest and rubber to sawah. The following comparisons of the PCR
<1>      1,800 ha of this in the Stage I area. Area berved by Piruko which
could be irrigated now is 2,500 ha (see para 5.5).

mission's estimates with those of the SAR assume that the whole area will
eventually be converted to sawah.

Following  detailed  survey  and  design during implementation, it was found
that command areas had changed; 263 ha of high land in the area to be served
from the Piruko had to be excluded because it was out of command, but this
was compensated for by the inclusion of 410 ha of irrigable land adjacent to
the Piruko headrace canal. In the command area of the Siat. 450 ha of
high land was excluded from the project area and conlverted into rubber
plantation.
6.5      Crooned   Area  and  Cropping  Intensitv.  Indigenous  farmers  are
reluctant to convert mixed forest to sawah and it is not certain that the
project will ever reach full development. Nevertheless, for the purpose of
estimating an ERR, the PCR has assumed that full development of the
irrigated area will be reached in the year 2000. The assumptions are shown
in Annex 1, Table 3, and summarized below:

6.6      At project completion (end of 1988), cropping  intensity  has  only
increased by 17% (or 33% if the area of mixed forest is excluded) due to
numerous constraints affecting agricultural development (para 5.7).
6.7      Crop Yiglds. Comparison of appraisal and mission estimates of  crop
yields are shown in Annex 1, Table 3. The very low yields estimated at
appraisal for the future without the project were probably due to poor soil
fertility before project commencement as a result of bad land clearing and
levelling techniques whereby most of the top soil had been removed. Since
then, soil ftertility has improved through continuous application of organic
manure by farmers and new land clearing has been more careful.

6.8      prgduction. The annual production of paddy is estimated to increase
from 4,200 tons without the project to 93,000 tons with the project at full
development. compared with the  SAR  estimates  of  1,700  and  37,200 tons,
respectively  (Annex 1,  Table 3).  Production  of  rainfed  crops  such  as
groundnuts and maize is expected to be negligible.
6.9      Farm Income. Land in the project area is allocated to tra ,n'igrants
or is community land. No data are available concerning the cultivable area
(cropped or uncropped) and the area under mixed forest and rubber (and
productivity), owned by an average indigenous family. The farm model
assumed at appraisal (1 ha of land in the command area for transmigrants anu
4 ha for indigenous families) do not appear to be representative of the
current situation: many transmigrants have up to 1.75 ha in the command area
and the average land holding per iidigenous family is smaller than assumed
at appraisal. Based on interviews with village chiefs, one farm model of
1.75 ha has been prepared by the PCR mission. The estimated net income at
full development is summarized below:
Net Family       Return

Incremental                 1,883          10,700
6.10     ERR. In estimating the ERR, the many  assumptions  that  have  been
made  concerning  the  future development of the project have tended towards
the optimistic. Nevertheless, the ERR, which has been recalculated in
Annex 1, is now estimated to be only 4%. This is substantially less than 18%
estimated at appraisal due to lower economic price of rice, cost overruns
and slower build-up of benefits.
Study and Design
6.11     Cisanggaruna  River  Basin  Study.  Resulting from the study, river
improvement works have been constructed  on  the  Crucuk  River  to  protect
agricultural land from flooding.
6.12     Jatigede  Dam  Design.  Lack  of  finance  has delayed the start of
construction  and  therefore  the  design  has  not  yet  been   used.   The
resettlement study which was added to this component left several important
questions unanswered; however, it is impracticable to finalize resettlement
plans until it is known that construction will actually proceed.
Institutional Strengthening
6.13     DGWRD MIS established five  systems.  The  personnel  system  lists
details of staff including personal history and is generally only used by
personnel departments. The equipment inventory system does not appear to be
extensively used. The inventories of irrigation schemes and irrigated sawah
are of little value because data entered into the systems are inaccurate and



- 8 -
out-of-date. The system for monitoring ongoing contracts appears to be the
system most used. This is a computerized version of a previously manually-
operated system to measure financial progress of contracts each month and
compare it with targets. Information is sent on paper from provinces and
projects each month to DGWRD headquarters for entering. There appears to be
no feedback to provinces and projects and only directorates in the main MPW
complex can be connected to the system (0OI II at Cawang is not connected).
Information supplied is often inaccurate, incomplete and late. This system
is being gradually improved.
6.14     The  collection.  grocessing  and  evaluation  of hydrological data
component exceeded the number of data collection stations proposed and made
a good start on producing data yearbooks. However, after the departure of
the consultant, the rate of production of yearbooks slowed down and has not
achieved the appraisal target.
6.15     The  water  users'  training component identified and resolved many
problems at district level and below, related to operation and maintenance
of tertiary canals and established successful training systems for various
categories of people. This component has so far operated in 14 districts
where it has improved cooperation between officials from different agencies
and within WUAs; this is less than 10% of  the  number  of  districts  which
would benefit from such training. The consultancy is continuing under the
ISSP.
6.16     The manpower develr. -Pnt  planning  component  was  only  partially
successful.  Only  9  out o. the planned 23 DGWRD units were prepared by the
consultants for implementatior. of the manpower planning system. Even now the
DGWRD Personnel Division claim they do not understand the system which they
are supposed to be implementing.
7. Project Sustainability
7.1      Sitiuna  II.  There  is  doubt  whether  thn  project  will ever be
completed. Although contracts have been awarded for construction of all main
and secondary canals, some 8,000 ha do not yet have tertiary development and
it is no longer GOI oolicy to finance tertiary development. More than
5,000 ha of this requires the land to be cleared; much of this land grows
forest rubber and the indigenous population are often reluctant to convert
this to sawah. If the development of the project area is completed, the
risks of not maintaining acceptable levels of net benefits are that the
irrigation system will not be adequately maintained and that there may be
insufficient water for the area served from the Piruko. To augment the water
by pumping from Batang Hari requires substantial budget for operation and
maintenance of the pumping station, both for supply of diesel fuel and
maintenance of a silt-free intake channel.
8. Bank Performan,:e
8.1      Project preparation was very uneven. The concept of the project and
its components were not clearly defined before appraisal. None of the
components included in the appraised project were considered in the initial
stages of preparation. Only the WUT and the hydrological components were
considered before appraisal for inclusion in the project.



- 9 -
8.2     A8Eraisal. The  major  component,  Sititing II.  was  added  to  the
project during the appraisal mission. Although a consultant's report had
indicated that this was a feasible scheme, the appraisal mission overlooked
an F(AO/CP review which correctly foresaw many of the risks (see para 4.1).
Some of these risks might have been avoided had the Bank financed land
clearing and land levelling, but these were not financed nor was land
levelling taken into account when estimating the costs and the ERR. The lack
of preparation of the institutional strengthening components, also added
during the appraisal stage, is indicated by the poor results from the MIS
study  and  the  eventual omission of the upgrading of financial control and
auditing procedures. It appears that the Bank's anxiety to achieve the
lending programme target may have persuaded the appraisal mission to package
a large number of incompletely rrepared components in the project. The
Bank's forecast of the 1995 price of rice used at appraisal was 250% higher
than the current forecast.
8.3      Sugervision.  Formal  supervision  missions  were  staffed   almost
entirely by engineers; only the first included an agronomist. More attention
by an agronomist might have emphasized the delays in land clearing and land
levelling and encouraged GOI to allocate funds for this. In addition to
formal supervision missions, staff from Washington and RSI and an MIS
consultant gave advice. This was particularly important to the MIS component
which otherwise might have achieved nothing; the Bank insisted on changing
the MIS consultant's contract from being based on man-months provided to
being based on results; this and the Bank's insistence on a supervising
consultant being provided by GOI ensured that some results were obtained
from the MIS consultancy. The PCR mission's review of project files
indicates that staff time-was devoted overwhelmingly to Sitiung and, to a
lesser extent, to MIS and appeared to nealect other components.
8.4      Lessons Learngd. For reasons of institutional expediency, the  only
implementing   agency   was   DGWRD.  The  Sitiung  project  indicates  that
involvement of the Department of Agriculture in irrigation projects,
particularly where there is newly developed land, is essential if the
project is to be successful.
8.5      If project preparation is rushed, possibly because  of  anxiety  to
meet the Bank's lending programme target, there are risks of the project
being unsuccessful.
8.6      Institutional support components such as the strengthening of DGWRD
MIS require detailed preparation. This is most likely to be achieved if it
is insisted that a full description of the objectives and methods are
included in the SAR. This was done for the hydrology and WUT components
which were successfully implemented but not fcr the MIS which had limited
success, nor for the financial control and auditing component which was
cancelled.
8.7      Delays in the start of consultancies might be avoided if  it  is  a
condition of loan effectiveness that consultants' contracts have been
signed, instead of consultants having been appointed.

9. Borrower's Performance
9.1      Many  of  the  criticisms  of  the  Bank's  performance  during the
preparation and appraisal could also be made of the borrower. Other than
Sitiung II, which was strongly pushed, there appeared to be doubts about
what should be included in the project. During implementation, the borrower
was unable to meet the commitment to allocate adequate funds but otherwise
generally  performed  satisfactorily.   Coordination   between   DGWRD   and
Directorate-General of Food Crops Agriculture (DGFCA) could have been
improved but this would not necessarily have overcome the problem of delayed
land clearing and land levelling, which was mainly due to lack of funds.
10. Project Relationship
10.1     The Bank maintained good relationships with GOI and  DGWRD  through
the RSI. The Bank appears to have been too willing to finance the
construction of Sitiung II because GOI wanted this, even though the project
had been shown to involve serious risks. More contact with DGFCA might have
improved progress on land clearing and land levelling.
11. Consultants and Contractors
11.1     Strengtheninig  DGWRD  MIS.  The local consultant appointed for this
was insufficiently experienced and, even with considerable advice and
assistance from Bank staff and consultants and another consultant appointed
by DGWRD to supervise, the result was disappointing (see para 6.13).
11.2     Mangower  Development.  The  results  obtained  from  the   foreign
consultants were disappointing. The consultants project director was not in
Indonesia and did not delegate to his staff in Indonesia nor provide
suitable direction (see para 6.16).
11.3     Other consultants were generally satisfactory.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.1     The SAR and loan  agreement  provided  an  adequate  framework  for
project implementation. Some minor modifications were agreed between the
borrower and the Bank. The provisions of the loan agreement were generally
observed (see Part III, Table 7). The project documents were unusual for
irrigation projects in that there was no provision for recovery from the
beneficiaries of costs of construction and operation and maintenance of the
Sitiung II works.
12.2      The borrower prepared a PCR which formed a useful source  of  data
for this report but gave little analysis of the impact of the project and
lessons learned.

COMMENT FOR PART I and III 1/
1. Page 2, para 4.1. the inclusion of rubber area as part of project
area was in line with the result of indigenous farmers interview
carried  out  prior  to the implementation  of  the  project.   The
farmer's perception was, in fact, strongly influenced by the
relatively high financial reward of the irrigated crop areas
enjoyed  by  the transmigrant of Sitiung I.   But then most of  the.
indigenous farmers were not converting their rubber trees int.o
sawah because they expected the Government to clear and develop
their   land  as  compensation  to  them  for  providing  land   to
transmigrants.
2. Page 3, para 5.4. the report stated and we agree that construction
progress  was  generally slow due partly to lack of  funds.   Other
reason also worthwile to be mentioned is the need to redesign the
foundation of weir to meet with field  condition.   Initial  design
assumed, based on former geotechnical investigation, r ock layer
exist but, in fact, it was not.
3. Page 8, para 6.15. at the end of this para, suggested to add the
following :
"Therefore, the on going WUTP should be continued as well as be
expanded   to   the  area  where  the  irrigation  development   or
rehabilitation has been completed.   Besides, the WlJTP should cover
training in the area not only for surface water irrigation, but
also ground water, swamp and fishpond area".

Cnmments:
The initiating project brief suggested the inclusion of four sector
components and a number of construction projects depending on their state of
preparation with a project cost of about US$415 million and a loan of about
US$200-225 million. None of the components listed in the initiating project
brief was included in Irrigation XVI, though some were included in other
projects.  FAO/World  Bank  Cooperative  Programme  reviewed   the   foreign
consultants feasibility study for Sitiung II in August and September 1980
as preparation for a proposed Irrigation XVIII project and concluded that
the project's concept was not sound and the project was not recommended
(Part I, para 4.1).
A further project brief in April 1981 included improvement to water users
associations (WUAs) and the hydrological network, both of which were finally
included in the project, but none of the other components was included at
this stage. The uncertainty about the content of the project continued
through appraisal. The Sitiung component was added to the project during the
appraisal mission which also further considered improving of WUAs and the
hydrological network and studies and designs in the Cisanggarung Basin.
Issues raised, following the appraisal mission, were the capacity of DGWRD
to   implement   new  projects  and  availability  of  GOI  funds.  Tertiary
development in four provinces and studies in the Pemali-Comal area, although
included during the appraisal mission, were subsequently omitted. During
negotiations, rehabilitation of the South Jatiluhur irrigation system was
dropped at GOI request because of restrictions on local budget funds.

Comments:
The SAR was unusual in that it showed disbursement continuing for 18 months
after the loan closing date in the Loan Agreement. It was expected in
March 1989 that final disbursement would be before the end of June 1989 and
that close to 100X of the loan would be disbursed.

available.
Comments:
For the Sitiung component, costs have increased only by 10% from appraisal
estimates when expressed in US dollars but, when expressed in rupiah, the
cost overrun is 129%. This is due to more rapid inflation than anticipated
at appraisal, combined with a longer construction period and the addition of
items not included in the SAR; land development, pumping station repairs,
laad acquisition at Batang Siat and increased area developed at Batang
Piruko. The estimated cost of Sitiung II is about USS5,8OO/ha in current
dollars. The reductions in costs of the other components are, despite
generally increased inputs, due to the devaluation of the rupiah and other
currencies paid to foreign consultants and overestimation in the appraisal
report.

Comments:
The PCR estimate of incremental paddy production is much greater than
estimated in the SAR due to the increased area and higher estimated crop
yields. Due to lack of data, the PCR estimate of th*^ number of beneficiaries
has been based on the incremental area divided by 1.75 ha per family. The
SAR assumed that 1,800 transmigrants would have 1 ha in the project area and
the remaining 4,900 ha would be in 4 ha holdings. It is not clear how the
SAR estimate of 7,000 direct beneficiaries (plus 1,000 indirect) was
derived.

Comments:
The SAR assumed a 1990 price of rice of US$638/t in 1981 vaiues. This
corresponds to US$857lt in 1988 prices. The PCR has based the estimated
benefits on an assumed 1995 price of US$243/t in 1988 prices. The basis for
the analysis is explained in Annex 1.

<2>   There were three deadlines for appointing consultants:
- 1 August 1982 for construction supervision;
- 1 January 1983 for MIS (this was late) and upgrading financial
control and audit procedures (deleted because component
cancelled);
-  1 April 1983 for Water Users  Training for which consultants were
selected but there was delay in signing their contract.
Cnmments:
Supervision reports (and this table, which is largely based on the
supervision reports) tend to ERR on the favourable side when reporting the
status of covenants. For example, Status 2 is given even when compliance is
later than deadline. The mission understands that the involvement of WUAs in
design of tertiaries was rare and, although Status 3 is not incorrect, it
could give a misleading impression.

SIXTEENTH IRRIGATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2118-IND)
ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION OF SITIUNG II
Gene.-al
1.       The SAR assumed that Sitiung II project would have no effect on the
agricultural production of the 3,300 ha in the Sitiung I area which was to
have been developed under Irrigation IX. The only benefit in this area would
be a saving in the cost of pumping water from Batang Hari, which would be
replaced by water flowing by gravity from the Piruko. However, owing to the
failure of the pumps and the slow agricultural development (only about
1,800 ha of the 3,300 ha in Sitiung I area has so far been irrigated), it is
difficult to accurately differentiate between the future benefits due to
each stage. In an attempt to simplify the economic analysis, the PCR has
estimated the f.ture development of the whole Sitiung project and then
proportioned the incremental benefits of agricultural production from the
whole project in proportion to the areas that would have received irrigation
with and without the project based on two assumptions (see Part I, paras 6.2
and 6.3):
Case 1 - Without the project, the pumps would not have been repaired.
Casg 2 - Even without the project, GOI would have repaired the pumps.
As in the SAR, previous construction was treated as a sunk cost and was not
included in the main economic evaluation.
Project Cost
2.       All investment costs since the start  of  the  Sitiung II  project,
which pertain to irrigation development in the project area and are
necessary to complete the project works and land development, have been
included  in  the  cost streams. Past expenditures have been brought to 1988
price levels using wholesale price indices (Table 2). The financial costs
shown in Table 1 have been adjusted to economic costs using the conversion
factors given in Table 2. The estimated operation and maintenance costs of
Rp25,000/ha/year   (financial  cost  excluding  pumping),  which  have  been
included in the cost streams, assume that the system will be adequately
maintained.



- 32 -
Benefits
3.       Incremental crop production at full development, which  is  assumed
to  be  achieved  in  2000/01, has been calculated for the combined areas of
Sitiung I and II on the basis of the assumed future cropping patterns and
yields presented in Table 3. Financial production costs and benefits per
hectare are shown in Table 4 and the economic net benefits at full
production   in   Table 5.  These  are  based  on  gravity  irrigation.  The
incremental pumping requirements are shown in Table 6 for Case 1 and Table 8
for Case 2: pumping costs are in Tables 7 and 9. Benefits due to Sitiung II
have been assumed to increase as shown in the tables.
Prices
4.       Input  and  output prices are given in Table 2. Economic prices for
traded commodities have been derived on the basis of IBRD commodity price
forecasts for 1995. Import parity prices have been used for maize,
groundnuts, TSP and KCl and export parity prices for urea. Indonesia was a
net importer of rice until 1982. From that year onwards, however, it has
become just self-sufficient. It is difficult to forecast with certainty
whether the country will import or export rice in the future. An average
price of import and export parity has therefore been used in the analysis.
The economic cost for draft animals has been assumed to be the same as the
financial. A conversion factor of 0.8 has been used to convert the financial
cost of farm labour to economic values. A conversion factor of 0.9 has been
used to convert financial prices of cassava to economic value.
Economic Rate of Return
5.       Based on the above assumptions, an ERR of 4% has been estimated for
the Sitiung II project (Case 1) over 30 years as shown in Table 7. The ERR
is considerably lower than the 18% estimated at appraisal. Reasons for this
are the 40% lower (when expressed in 1988 terms) economic price for rice,
cost overrun (130%) on construction and a slower build-up of benefits than
foreseen  in  the  SAR.  These  factors  are  partially  offset  by   higher
incremental production. If full development is not reached by 2000, the ERR
would of course be lower.
6.       If it is assumed that even  without  the  project  GOI  would  have
repaired the pumps (Case 2), the ERR reduces to 2%. The ERR is not sensitive
to changes in the cost of pumping. When the costs and benefits of Stage I
are combined with Stage II, the ERR becomes -4% (Table 10).
7.       The  above results assume that the completed systems are maintained
in full working order. If this is not done, benefits would gradually
decrease and rehabilitation would be necessary. This would result in a lower
ERR.

(3> Actual areas until 1988. Assumed linear increase from 1991 to 2000.
(4) Assumes on average gravity flows can irrigate 3.170 ha. Area pumped is that part of the area irrigated
for which it Is assumed pumping would be necessary.
(5> Assumed linear increase from 1989 to 2000.
(6> Although 1.600 ha are expected to be irrigated in 1989, it is not expected that full benefits will be
obtained. A smaller area has therefore been entered in the table.
