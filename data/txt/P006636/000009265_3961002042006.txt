SMALL JARNI  SYCIS 
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Chile for US$95.0 million equivalent ts submitted for
approval. The proposed loau would be on standard Bank terms with seventeen
years*' aturity Including five years of grace, and variable Interest rate, and
*          would belp to finance a small farmer servicea project.
2.        MAkuMMAL.  Since the mid-1960s, the agricultural sector of Chile
has experienced an extended period of growth, interrupted only briefly by the
turmoll of the  arly 1970a and macroecoaomic imbalaees In the early 19808.
8ince 1985, agriculture has becom a dynamic and Increasingly vital sector of
the economy, growing at about 5X per annum. Macroeconomic and trade policy
have a major influence on its performance. Recent growth can be attributed
largely to sustained trade liberalization policies and economic stability.
Trade reform has been complemented by the deregulation of factor markets and a
serie of innovative sectoral measures which have promoted the efficient
allocation of resoures to and within the agricultural sector. Agriculture--
including forestvy and fisheries--currently generates about 9S of GDP, employs
182 of the labor forces, nd accounts for over one-third of export earnings.
3.        The small producer has participated in this growth only to a
limited extent.              of public programs in the 1970s and growing
reliance on private initiatives to service the sector resulted in poorer
producers being without access to capital end technical assiitance. To rmady
this, in 1983184, a major program was launched through the Agricultural
Development Institute (IDDAP), an agency of the Ministry of Agilculture, to
addres the technical assistance and complementary credit needs of small
farmers. *SRUP provided technical assistance through privately-contracted
consulting firms carrying out on-farm visits and group sessions, and credit
for working capital end investments. This Was the core component of the Bank-
finaced Agricultural Services and Credit Project (Ln. 2481-CE), approved by
the Board of Directors In 1984, and closed on October 30, 1991. The program
focussed initially on producers who bad enough resources to be potentially
self-sufficient; however, In 1987/88 INDAP broadened the program to include
minifundistas--farmers with inadequate land resources to achieve self-
sufficiency from traditional farming. The program for the poorer farers bad
greter social orientation, and stressed simple techniques to raise
productivity and family well-being. Scarce resources prevented INDAP's
program from reaching more than 102 of its 250,000 potential beneficiaries.
4.        The Governmant, citing Its desire to attack rural poverty and its
concern for the low coverage of past initiatives, has reinforced the
importance of INDAP. Its oporations are being re-oriented and expanded,
giving greter emphasis to mJn1Ztdist" by allowing IBDAP to serve only those
Sga-gWnfundists vwho are already In the program (16,000).  The number of
SIaRU&S"a" in INDAP's technology transfer program, on the other hand, hs
been enlarged from 11,000 in 1987/88 to 17,900 In 1990191. To strengthen the
program's mossage, the role of the Institute of Agricultural Research (1IA),
the primary public agenay chaged with agricultural mad livestock research,



-2-
ha been broadened to generate technology packages specifically for small
farmer. The development and demonstration of such packages will be carried
out by UMA, under a project signed on Z.tch 13, 1992 with the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB). Additionally, I=A, IDDAP and firms implemnting
IDAP's technology transfer program. are collaborating to fotmulate regional
strategies of technology development and transfer for the small farmers.
S.        Ratlonal  fox la*k IvolveamAt. The proposed project is consistent
with the Bank's country strategy for the near-term, to expand the coverage and
enhanco the quality of selected social programs and services to improve
overall welfare, to alleviate poverty and to strengthen the institutional
capacity of public sector agacies to carry out their respective roles more
effectively. The project is also consistent vith the recoamundations made in
the 1990 Atricultural Sector Review which advocated selective, fiscally
prudent growth in small farmer initiatives, in addition to complementary
programs to gesnerate technology for smell producers, and reactivate land
titling, especially In rural areas.
6.        The project would build on lessons learned from the recently-closed
Agricultural Services and Credit Project (Ln. 2481-CE) which revealed the
following weaknesses: (a) on-sustainable financing of tecbnology transfers
(b) effectively unlimited client participation in INDAP programst
(c) inadequate discipline In IMDAP's management and accountting of its credit
operationst and (d) deficient monitoring and evaluation. The project would
concentrate principally on IUDAP, refining its technology transfer system and
introducing more efficiency and rigor into its administration and f4iancial
operations. A crucial Bank role vould be to encourage mcre realistic and
manageable expansion In INDAP's technical assistance and credit operations,
enhsnce its capacity to manage Its credit portfolio in conformity with sound
busitess principles, and introduce a systematic graduation of beneficiaries
from both IZDAP programs. In the technoloav transfer uro ram, participants
would enter Phase I (3-6 years) providing very basic technical and social
welfare skills to groups and individuals, and graduate on the basis of
evaluation criteria to Phase II (3 years), which would focus mate On group
contact and entrepreneurial skills. Following graduation from Phase II,
farmers could proceed to Phase III, depending on INDAW's capacity to serve
them, and pay the full cost of service provided. In aredi2 INDA*' role would
become that of a facilitator, establishing a credit history for small farmers
to enable them to bave access to commercial credit. The 4ifundistas have a
better record of repaying loans than INDA 'I traditional clients (non-
miAnfundistaS) since they: (a) borrow small amounts; (b) usually augment their
inome with non-farm activities; and (c) are more Inclined to establish a
credit record to gain access to comiercial credit. At appraisal, this view
was confirmed for a representative sample of short-term loans. The proposed
project vould also ensure Government attention to complementary land titlng,
an activity neglected in recent year.
7.        Proiect ObJectives. The project woulds (a) overcome constraints to
increased smell-farmer productivity and incomes and Improved well-being;
(b) enhance the institutional capacity and effectiveness of INDAP and the
Sinistry of Wational Property (MBV); and (c) foster small-farmor access to
commercial markets for their products and factors of production, and to
publicly-sponsored agricultural development programs.
8.        Prolot DuscrfiptiA. The project would Includes (a) tochnology
transfer, involving both farm-oriented extension and hose-centered ssistance
(family kitchen gardens, water treatment, Improved diets and cooking methods,
awarenes of education and health services); (b) complementary credit for -



workimg capital (e.g., seed, fertilizers) and investment (e.g., fencing,
reproductive and draft animals, orchard establiebment, implements, on-fanm
storage), consistent with technology transfer initiatives; (c) land titling;
(d) a rural communication system to improve the dissemination of information
related to email farmer production and social servicest and (e) institutional
strengthening. The technology transfer, credit, and rural commuication
components would be impleumnted by TDAP and the land titling eomponent by
IM. The Institutional strengthening component would include both
institutions. Comitmant to these actions io reflected in the strategic plans
of IRD    and 9 IN, agreed with the Bank during project preparation.
9.        INDAP's well-designed system of technology transfer and credit
would be refined to incorporate the following innovations: (a) greater
emphasis on aWfundisMI; (b) graduation criteria for both programs; (c) more
use of non-overnmental organizations (IGO), farmer organizations, and IUIA in
the technology transfer process; (d) focus on women as a target group for
farm-oriented technical assistance and crefit; (e) more use of advanced audio-
visual techniques in technical assistasr e efforts; (f) specialized
envwironental trairJ.ng for extension workers; (g) sound loan portfolio
accounting and remedial measures to improve loan collections; and !3h, enhanced
monitoring end evaluation.
10.      An institutional analysis of ISDAP and 141 has been carried out
with the objective of identifying capacity gaps, including legislation,
inter-institutional linkages, organization, personnel policy and skills. Rey
interventions under the project would include: (a) more streamlined budgeting
of IINDP activitie; (b) wider definition of IDAE   clientele to include farmer
organizations; (a) establishing and staffing of a Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) unit; and (d) training. Regarding HBN, the institutional development
component would foster more streamlined processing and registration of titles
by, intor, &11 improving linkagoe with wnicipal governments, accelerating
title registration, introducing M&U, and improving skills for using new
information mangemet technology.
11.       The total cost of the project, Including taxes and duties, is
astimated at US$236.0 million equivalent of which about 14.3S represents
foreign exchange costs. Dutise and taxes amount to US$1.9 million. Physical
and price contingencies are estimatod to be US$8.9 million. The proposed Bank
loan of US$95.0 million equivalent would finance about 40.62 of total project
coats, nat of tames. Up to US$7 million equivalent in eligible project
expenditures would be financed retroactively to January 1, 1992. Project
beneficiaries would finance about US$26.3 million of on-farz investments and
working capital (11.22 of projoct costs net of taxes). Private intermediaries
would finance about US$10.6 million of on-farm iuvestment and working capital
(4.52 of project costs net of taxes). The balance would be financed by the
Government (37.72) and INDAP (6.0S). Project costs and the proposed financing
plan are shown in Schedule A.
12.       Amounts and methods of procurement and disburseament, and the
proposed disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank-group operations in Chle are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 10133-CE, dated April 14, 1992 is attached.
13.       kActLm ABKsed. Durisotion, the Government of Chile and
the ank agreed that: (a) the Government would support agricultural research
services oriented towards the needs of small farmers; (b) INDAP would study
ways of improving the incentives for private intermediaries to lend to farmers

by June 1, 1994, any technology transfer service delivered to Mnn-
miniafundista would be subject to each feet and, by June 1, 1994, T.DAP would
furnish detailed criteria for farmer graduation to Phases TT and ISil (h) the
mid-term review would be completed by July 1, 1994 and would plan appropriate
growth, if any, in project technology transfer and complementary credit for
the remainder of the iplementation period; (1) the Government would transfer
to NDAP the aouts requirod for INDAP to make subloans end working capital
subloans as required under the project. INDAl would be obligated to repay the
Gaornment these amounts, after deduction of targeted losses and
capitalization grants; (j) INDAP and USX would use standard operating,
administrative and accounting procedures, audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank; and (k) IDDA would review and analyze prospective
subloaie to esnure their consistency with agreed environmental safeguards.
14.       Conditions of Iffactivenass would be: (a) that tIDAP/NAG ratify the
agreed credit regulation; (b) that the ZIDAP Credit Information System
(CREDW) is fully operational; (a) establishment of the PCWK, with poers and
responsibilities atisfactory to the Bank; and (d) signing of the subsidiary
agreement between the Borrower and TIDAl in a form acceptable to the Bank.
15.       Brawfl.  The project would have a major Impact on the quality of
life, Income and legal security (titling) of a significant proportion of the
low Income, small farmer rural population of Chile. At full development, the
technology transfer program would benefit about 84,000 small farm families and
the credit program about 100,000 farm families (332 and 402 of the small
farmer population), respectively. Al1 but 16,000 of these farmers would be
uinifundlseI. Although the technology transfer program is initially geared
to reaching 68,000 famers by the mid-term review In June, 1994, this figure
could suboequently increase to 84,000 if progress to that point has been
satisfactory. The project would also target rural women in these farm
fmillies with specific actions desiged to develop their income-earning
potential, reinforcing the Gvernamt's initiative to recognise the Important
role of women in the Chilean economy. The land titling component would
benefit about 43,500 farm families, thereby providing security of land holding
and access to a range of public services and agricultural credit.
16.       An economic rate of return has not been calculated due to the
service and institutional development nature of the non-credit components. It
is clear, however, that vithout the project the small farmer in Chile,
especially in the Indigenous communities of the south, would continue to be a
disenfranchisd member of the economy.
17.       LJkAs. The principal project risks would bet (a) the potential for
political over-eagerness to ezpand programs to address rural poverty,
threatening MIDAP's operational capability; and (b) reluctance of the
cosmrcal credit market to extend credit to graduates of the TIDAl program.



-5-
Risk (a) is already being ainimised by a generaliued fiscal austerity, acting
as * breok on imprudent expansion of IBMAP program. As regards risk (b), the
project would attempt to change commercial credit market attitudes by:
(i) pilot testing various options proposed by the study on improving
incentives for private tntermediaries; and (it) by improving subloan portfolio
management to clarify each client's payment record.
18.      B*arsD@@&   The project is expected to have a beneficial impact
on the enironment through the following actions: (a) IUDA's technology
transfer programs would Incorporate new, INIA-developed technical package.
specifically for the small producor Including environmentally-sound farming
systems, tillage methods, and salinity control; (b) INDAP personnel,
extensionlits and quality control tesms would receive special environmental
training under the project to enhance their sensitivity and performsace with
regard to environmental issues; (e) INA expertc will participate in the
monthly meetings at the area level to discuss environmental issues arising
from the Implementation of INDAP's technology transfer and credit progrsms;
and (d) the rural communications component would include special production
and distribution of videos to farmer groups, and of television and radio
programs to schools and the general public, on environmentally sound practices
and the need for envi-ronenta1 protection. TNDP agreed at negotiations to
review and analyse prospective subloans to ensure their consistency with
4greed eavironmental safeguards. Commitment to environmental protection Is
reflected In the statemnt of policy and strategic plans of NAG, INDMP and
MBN. The Minister of MB, now prosides over the National Environmental
Commission (COJAM).
19.                     * cerenaion.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the ixecutive
Directors approve it.
