SI1MBARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        In 1966, IDA extended a credit of US$ 7.2 million to Ethiopia for
an education project (Credit No. 84-ET) which is expected to be satisfactor-
ily completed by '.ate 19.11. It provided for the expansion of secondary edu-
cation, teacher training and technical education.
ii.       Initial government proposals for a second project incluided a
considerable expansion of the country's secondary education system
together with investments in teacher training and agricultural and
technical education. Some of these proposals were not appropriate aL
Ethiopia's present stage of educational development and its present
financial position. Despite the present low enrollment figures,
additional resources for future commitments, especially for recurrent
expenditure, are extremely limited.  While only 16%' of the central
government's recurrent budget is devoted to education, as much as 40%
of recurrent education expenditure is dependent on foreign assistance.
Furthermore, the structure of present enrollments and the distribution
among different types of education are not in harmony with Ethiopia's
development requirements, e.g., too little emphasis on primary educatior
and practical subjects. In the absence of complete ranpower estimates,
the need for more than limited expansion of general secondary educatio7
is not clear. Finally, there is an acute shortage of qualified
Ethiopian teachers for all levels and types of education.
iii.      There is a great need for a comprehensive review of educatiei
and for restructuring the system to attain maximUM developmental impact
from limited resources. Pending such a review, Ethiopia should devote
its resources to meeting obvious priority needs.
iv.       The present project, which has emerged from extensive discussions
with the government before and during the appraisal visit, is based on the
considerations summarized in the preceding paragraphs. It would assist
teacher training and agricultural education and training. A liLmited expan-
sion of secondary education would be assisted to improve its quality and
regional distribution. Technical assistance would provide for a study of
the education sector, the completion of a manpower survey, the establishment
of a school maintenance section and project implementation.
v.        Staff for the institutions included in the project would be avail-
able and supported as necessary by technical assistance, financed by multi-
lateral and/or bilateral agencies and, in the short-term, development of
junior secondary teacher training, agricultural and technical education, by
the project. There would be an adequate supply of qualified students to en-
sure sufficient intake into the project schools.
vi.       Accommodation schedules and equipment lists have been reviewed and
are acceptable.  Sites for all the new schools and institutes have been
selected and are satisfactory. All the existing sites for extensions are
adequate except for 5 schools for which adequate land will be acquired within
one year from the signing of the Credit Agreement.



vii.      A project unit within the Mintstry of Education would be
responsible for project implementation. A consultant firm of architects
would be employed to design and supervise construction of the Academy
of Pedagogy, the Junior Secondary Teacher Training Institute and any
other institutions not designed by the project unit. Contracts for con-
struction as well as for furniture and equipment would be grouped in appro-
priate bid packages and awarded through international competitive bidding.
viii.     The project is estimated to cost US$ 13.4 million equivalent
with a foreign exchange component of US$ 7.3 million or 55Z of the to-
tal. Subject to the provisions set out in paras. 6.01-6.02, the proposed
project is suitable as a basis for an IDA credit of US$ 9.5 million (or
71% of the total estimated cost) which would provide for the foreign
exchange component and $2.2 million of local currency expenditure.



I. INTRODUCTION
History
1.01      The As2cciation first assisted education in Ethiopia in 1966
when a credit of US$ 7.2 million was extended to help finance a major ex-
pansion of secondary education, teacher training and technical education.
This project, which is expected to be satisfactorily completed by late
1971, has also aided the introduction of comprehensive curricula and the
teaching of practical subjects at the secondary level. In December, 1968,
a UNESCO project preparation mission assisted the government in preparing
a second education project for Bank/IDA financing. The government pro-
posals were for the construction of 82 new and expansions to 47 existing
schools, to provide a total of 42,500 places of which 38,000 would be
in general secondary education.
1.02      It became clear at an early stage that this request was based on
inadequate planning. A pre-appraisal mission visited Ethiopia in October,
1969, and discussed with the government the following major problem areas:
(i) the imbalance in the enrollment structure of secondary education, with
its preponderance of general academic studies; (ii) the absence of a com-
plete manpower study which made it difficult to evaluate the need for
technical education; (iii) the financial constraints; and (iv) the short-
age of qualified Ethiopian teachers. It was agreed that Ethiopia needed
to replan its education and training system.
1.03      The proposed second education project was therefore revised
to focus on specific needs and to include only those investment items
which were of immediate priority. This project was appraised in
February-March, 1970, by a mission composed of Messrs. 0. Markgren
(general education) G. Pennisi (economist), T. Apodaca (agricultural
education, FAO), A. Kinawy (architect, consultant), assisted by Messrs.
M. Hlultin (education adviser) and C. Naleppa (school building adviser).
1.04      The project is designed to assist a thorough replanning of
Ethiopian education and training, expand teacher training and agri-
cultural education, and improve secondary education. As modified
during pre-appraisal and appraisal, it would consist of:
(i) the construction and equipment of:
(a) An Academy of Pedagogy including a Primary
Teacher Training Institute; a new Primary Teacher
Training Institute; an extension to one Primary
Teacher Training Institute; and a Junior Secondary
Teacher Training Institute;



-2-
(b) 12 new general secondary schools; extensions
to 19 general secondary schools; multipurpose
halls for 23 secondary schools;
(c) three rural education institutes;
(d) three agricultural training centers, and exten-
sions to two Agricultural Institutes; and
(ii)  technical assistance to complete on-going manpower studies,
to conduct an education sector review, to organize a school
maintenance section, and to assist the implementation of
technical, agricultural education, and junior secondary
teacher training programs.
Socio-economic background
1.05      The total population (1970) is estimated at 24 million and is
growing at an annual rate of about 2%. More than 90% of the population
live in rural areas. About 45% of the population is below 14 years of
age.
1.06      The country is still at an early stage of economic and social
development. Per capita income is about US$ 63 per year. The economy
is largely based on subsistence agriculture. Agriculture contributes
58% of GDP; manufacturing only 8%. Coffee is the major cash crop and
provides more than half of export earnings. A few large agricultural
plantations provide the basis for some import substitution industries,
such as sugar. Farming and ranching are primitive. Modernization and
improved productivity require well-trained agricultural technicians and
a raising of the education level of the farm population.
1.07      From 1960 until 1966, the economy grew at a rate of 4.6% per
year, mainly as a result of a relatively rapid expansion of the non-
agricultural sectors. However, in the past three years, the monetary
sector of the economy underwent a mild recession, largely due to a
decline in coffee prices. This slowed down the rate of growth of total
GDP from 4.6% to 4.3%. The recession seriously affected the Government
budget and public savings in 1968/69 were completely eliminated.
1.08      The economy is now undergoing a period of revival, largely
due to the increase in world coffee prices. The fiscal outlook is also
improving because of increases in the proceeds of export and import
duties, better tax collection and the proposed introduction of new taxes.
Recurrent expenditures are expected to be more effectively controlled.
Private and public investments should then increase.
Education and Training
1.09      The education system comprises a six-year primary course, a
secondary level with a two-year junior cycle and a four-year senior cycle
and a tertiary level of university and non-university courses (Chart 1).



- 3 -
1.10      Primary education enrollments increased by about 250% during
the last decade to 513,800 students in 1968/69 of which 74% were in
government schools (Annex 1 and Chart 2). In spite of this increase, the
participation rate is only 12.5% of the relevant age group as against
65% in Kenya (1968) and 35% in Tanzania (1969). The government contem-
plates an increase- in government school enrollments from 382,000 in 1968/69
to 1.1 million in 1979/80. The drop-out rate is extremely high in grades
1-3 in rural areas, because most schools have only these lower grades and
operate in provisional facilities. The curriculum needs revision to align
it with the needs for rural development.
1.11      Of the 7,110 teachers in public primary schools in 1968/69,
63% were qualified by official standards (Annex 2). Teacher training
needs expansion and re-orientation towards practical courses to relate
education more closely to development needs.
1.12      General secondary education enrollments in government schools have
increased from 19,200 students in 1960/61 to 94,000 in 1969/70, growth being
particularly rapid since 1965. As a result, half the pupils in junior se-
condary schools are in inadequate facilities. In 1968/69 about 3.3% of the
age group was enrolled in general secondary schools 1/ with private institu-
tions providing for about 13% of the total. The quality of the output is
poor. In order to allow for qualitative improvements and for a gradual re-
adjustment of the system, expansion should be controlled and a new type of
secondary education, better geared to the rural environment, should be ex-
perimented on a pilot scale.
1.13      About 16% of the total staff of 2,610 teachers in government
secondary schools in 1968/69 were qualified Ethiopians, including uni-
versity service students 2/. Forty-two percent of the total staff were
recruited from abroad. The training program for senior secondary school
teachers is conducted at Haile Selassie I University and seems to be ade-
quate but teacher training for the junior level urgently needs expansion.
(Annexes 3-5).
1.14      Government technical school enrollments were 3,834 in 1968/69;
private schools catered for 2,672 students. Lack of proper management
and coordination with industry, leading to poor employment prospects for
students, have adversely affected enrollments in technical schools, in-
cluding those financed under the first IDA credit.
1/   Primary teacher training and technical schools catered for an addi-
tional 0.4%.
2/   The students of Haile Selassie I University spend a year in field
work (mostly teaching), called University Service.



-4-
1.15      Government agricultural education at secondary level is given only
in comprehensive schools supported by the first IDA project. To staff pro-
perly the agricultural streams in secondary schools, agricultural teacher
training needs expansion. Also needed is a unit comprising at least two
agricultural experts within the Ministry of Education to deal with all agri-
cultural education activities in general schools and assurances that such a
unit will be formed were given by the government during negotiations. This
unit will collaborate with the Ministry of Agriculture which operates two
post-secondary agricultural schools at Ambo and Jimma.
II. THE COST AND FINANCING OF EDUCATION
Total Expenditure
2.01      Financing of the education system is shared by several Govern-
ment Ministries, semi-Government agencies, churches, missions and private
institutions. The Ministry of Education is responsible for about 70% of
the government's total recurrent expenditure on education. The remaining
30% is allocated chiefly to the Haile Selassie I University and the Minist-
ries of National Community Development and Agriculture. Semi-governmental
agencies and public authorities provide training programs without specific
Government contributions. Very few subsidies are given to the private
sector. Public education is free. Allowances are provided for students
in technical and agricultural education, teacher training, and higher
education. A tax on agricultural land, which yields about Eth. $ 5.0
million annually, is earmarked to assist financing of primary education.
No records of past total expenditures exist. Estimates of total public
and private expenditures on education for 1968/69 are as follows (Annex 6);
Estimated Expenditures in Eth $ millions, 1968/69
Recurrent                        Capital                 Total
Domestic/Foreign Assistance       Domestic/Foreign Assistance
84.1          42.8                 8.2          9.7              144.9
Recurrenrt Expenditure
2.02      The central government's recurrent expenditures on education
in 1968/69 (Eth. $64 million) account for 18% of the total recurrent
government expenditure. This is less than the total recurrent cost of
education since, for 1968/69 alone, foreign assistance, covering mainly
the salaries of teachers and experts, was approximately Eth. $42.8 mil-
lion (Annex 7). Recurrent expenditures of the University and the Min-
istry of Education increased by about 10% per year since 1965 compared
with a 6% p.a. average growth rate in total government recurrent revenue
(Annex 8).



- 5 -
2.03      An ever-increasing share of the recurrent budget of the Ministry
of Education is absorbed by teachers' salaries; in primary education teach-
ers' salaries rose from 90%01 in 1965 to 98% in 1968 as percentage of cost
and in secondary education from 86% to 91%. The lack of school maintenance
and the absence or shortage of materials and equipment adversely affects
the quality of instruction. Future increases in teachers' salaries should
not be made at the expense of maintenance. During negotiations the govern-
ment gave assurances that the student timetable in general secondary
schools would be reduced from 40 periods per week - unnecessarily excessive
- to about 30 without diminishing the teaching load per staff member. This
would save about Eth. $4 million for 1970/71 and as much as Eth. $75 million
for the decade 1970/1980.
Capital Expenditure
2.04      From 1965/66 to 1968/69 (Annex 7), domestically financed
government capital expenditures on education were Eth. $ 12.7
Tmillion - equivalent to only 5% of central government capital spending.
Foreign aid - both loans and grants - for capital expenditures is
estimated at some Eth. $17.3 million. The rapid increase in enrollment
in public, primary and secondary schools alone should have necessitated
some Eth. $65 million. Ilence, provision for capital spending was much
below requirements, which is reflected in the overcrowding of schools.
Projections of Future Expenditure
2.05       (a)  Recurrent expenditure.  Pending the completion of a new govern-
ment plan for the expansion of primary and secondary education, it is diffi-
cult to project future expenditures. The projection shown below is based
on discernible short-term enrollment trends such as a building program fi-
nanced at 50% by SIDA for 7,000 primary classrooms and a conservative
extrapolation of these trends based on the assumptions that: (a) the govern-
ment would succeed in limiting the growth of school enrollment; (b) adequate
provision would be made for equipment and maintenance; (c) growth in teachers'
salaries would be limited; and (d) payment of expatriate teachers would be
maintained at the present level (Annexes 2, 3, 4, and 9).

-6-
In view of the expected rapid increase in recurrent expenditure on education
during the next three years, estimated at 14% per annum, the government has
approved an income tax increase and an urben property tax, to be earmarked
for education. Of greater significance than short-term remedies of limited
impact, however, is a thorough replanning of the future development of the
education sector. Such replanning would be based on an education sector
survey, the financing of which would be part of the proposed IDA project.
2.06      (b)  Capital expenditure.  In projecting the capital budget of
the Ministry of Education and of Haile Selassie I University, foreign as-
sisted programs and projects are assumed to be the major source of capital
financing.  This source may yield Eth. $50.9 million in the period 1970-1975.
Domestically financed central government capital expenditures are estimated
at some Eth. $45.6 million.  These amounts would be sufficient to meet short
term investment needs provided that a double shift system is introduced in
the secondary schools in urban areas. During negotiations, assurances were
given by the government that at least 14,000 of the student places to be
added to the system by 1972/73 will be through the introduction of double-
shift working in existing schools.
2.07      Financing of Agricultural Education.  Ministry of Agriculture
appropriations for its education department (para 1.15) are estimated to
have averaged about Eth. $0.5 million per annum in the last 5 years (Annex
10), equivalent to 1% of total government recurrent expenditure on education
and training in 1968/69. Capital expenditures have been negligible, being
estimated at about Eth. $160,000 over the last 5 years or less than 1% of to-
tal capital spending by the Ministry of Agriculture. Lack of adequate recur-
rent financing has been a major constraint to the proper operation of the two
schools. Despite the high number of applicants for admission to one of the
schools, (about 1,000 in 1968), only 130 students were admitted although the
school capacity is 200. Annual recurrent expenditures for the two schools
and three training centers included in the project would be approximately
Eth. $1.0 million when in full operation.
III. THE NEED FOR THE PROJECT
Education and Training for Economic Growth
3.01      Lack of adequately trained manpower at adl levels is one of
the main constraints to Ethiopian economic growth. Information on the
existing labor force, wage employment and future manpower requirements
is inadequate but discussions with major employers. trade unions and
the employment exchanges indicate that the present situation is
characterized by two contrasting features: (a) insufficient supply of
middle and high level manpower; and (b) growing unemployment of general
secondary and technical school graduates and "dropouts". These pro-
blems stem from an education system which does not prepare its output
for productive employment, weaknesses of the employment exchange service
and salary classifications too rigidly bound to formal education attain-
ments.



-7-
3.02      The education systeM as a whole requires a critical examination
if it is to produce the ranpower which would meet the quantitative and
qualitative needs of the Ethiopian economy. Therefore, an education sec-
tor review should be undertaken with adequate technical assistance. The
sector review should: (a) analyze the system's capacity to promote eco-
nomic, social ani cultural development; (b) recommend improvements and ex-
pansion of the system within the limits of the country's financial resour-
ces; and (c) identify priority investments in education. The sector re-
view should be available before the preparation of the Fourth Five Year
Development Plan 1973-78. To this end, the manpower studies now being car-
ried out by the Department of Labor of the Ministry of National Community
Development and Social Affairs should receive adequate technical assistance
in order to provide data in time for the education survey. During negotia-
tions, assurances were received that these studies will be completed by
June 30, 1972.
Secondary Education
3.03      While there is insufficient economic justification for a major
expansion program of secondary education, limited assistance, to provide
additional accommodation and equipment at a number of existing schools
and to make secondary education available in new developing areas, should
be given at this time to allow fuller use of existing facilities and to
implement more widely the diversified curriculum introduced into the
secondary school system by the first IDA education project. In this way,
provision would be made for pupils already entered in lower forms of sec-
ondary schools, some In fonner primary scliools. to enter higher forms
equipped for the new curriculum with its sclentif-c and practical subjects.
Extensions to secondary schools in urban areas and the addition of study
halls to permit the introduction of double-shflf  working are also recom-
men(led.  Further expansion of secondary educaion would be inadvisable
before the probable restructuring of the Ethiopian education system fol-
lowing the manpower survey and the education sector review. With the new
schools and extensions included in the present project, the number of
pupils in inadequate accommodation would fall from 37,000 (1969) to about
22,000 (1974-75) provided that the growth in secondary education enroll-
ment is controlled. To this effect, during negotIations, the government
confirmed its proposal to limit general secondary enrollment to 115,000
by 1972-73.
3.04      Ethiopia's education needs to become better geared to rural
environment. Although a major reform of the system is expected to stem
from the education sector review included in the project (para. 3.02),
the starting of a pilot scheme of Rural Education Institutes is recom-
mended. The three institutes included in the project would concentrate,
in collaboration with the extension service, on practical agricultural
training for primary school leavers and farmers and would be located in
areas with different ecological and agricultural conditions in order to
gain the widest possible experience during this pilot stage.



-8-
Agricultural Education
3.05      Ethiopia's continuing economic development chiefly depends upon
agricultural output and efficiency. Current government projects affect
only a small proportion of the four million farm families in the subsis-
tence sector. The extension service is very weak, with only 138 qualified
extension workers in the field. Budgetary appropriations for the exten-
sion service are no likely to allow more than 60 additional field assis-
tants and 10-20 extension agents per year although Ethiopia requires a
much larger body of qualified extension workers engaged in the field.
3.06      Field assistants are also in great demand by the major employers;
the annual need for the period 1969-1973 is estimated at 175. The output
of the three pilot training centers included in the proposed project, about
120 per year at full capacity, should therefore easily find employment (An-
nex 11). Pending completion of the manpower studies, provision for a larger
output would not be advisable.
3.07      Intermediate level agricultural technicians - trained at the
Ambo and Jimma Institutes - are needed to strengthen the extension service
and other departments of the Ministry of Agriculture, to provide special-
ized personnel for agricultural development and to supply teachers of agri-
culture in secondary schools. In addition, mechanization in commercial
farming and new emphasis in livestock production require the training of
specialists in agricultural machinery and animal production. Extension
and upgrading of the Ambo and Jimma Institutes, as proposed in the project,
would increase the output from about 100 to 180 graduates per year when at
full capacity.  The public sector alone is expected to employ about two-
thirds of the graduates.
Teacher Training
3.08      Teacher training for primary and secondary schools is a high
priority. By 1979/80 about 25,000 government primary school teachers will
be needed for which the training requirement will be about 23,000. The
existing teacher training institutes can supply only about 14,000 (Annex 2).
3.09      Teacher training should be improved qualitatively to permit the
introduction of a primary school curriculum more closely geared to Ethio-
pian needs, especially in rural areas. Supervision of primary schools
should be strengthened. Only 52 Ethiopian teacher trainers are on the
staff of the five existing primary teacher training institutes. By 1979/
80 these five and the three in the project will need at least 330 teacher
trainers. At least 200 primary school supervisors will be required. A
new institute, the Academy of Pedagogy, should therefore be established for
developing curriculum research and training primary school teacher trainers
and supervisors.
3.10      At the junior secondary level, about 3,300 teachers will be need-
ed by 1980 (Annex 3), for which the training requirement Is 3,600. Since
the Faculty of Education of Haile Selassie I University is phasing out its



- 9 -
junior secondary teacher training program for general subjects - which is
now provisionally transferred to the Technical Institute of Addis Ababa -
new facilities are required. For the training of teachers in practical
subjects, the University, together with a proposed junior secondary teach-
er training institute, will provide the required supply (Annex 3), and
largely eliminat: the country's dependence on foreign and unqualified
teachers by about 1979/80. reacher training requirements are shown in
Annexes 2-5 and summarized below.

Technical Education
3.11      Before the completion of a manpower survey, it is impossible to
quantify requirements of specific skills to be produced by the technical
schools. Because the present schools are under-utilized (para. 1.14), the
government should be assisted in making greater use of existing facilities.
This requires technical assistance in teaching, curriculum development and
administration as an interim measure, pending the overall replanning of
Ethiopia's education system.

The project schools would have 49,410 student places of which 10,585 would
be provided by this project.
B.   Technical Assistance for:
(a)  comple-irn of on-going manpower studies;
(b) an education sector survey;
(c) introduction of a school maintenance section; and
(d) project implementation.
Teacher Training
4.02      (a)  Academy of Pedagogy - A post-secondary institution, located
at Bahr Dar, would train teachers for primary teacher training institutes
and primary school supervisors. The four-year course would have two years of
specialization in subject areas, one year of teaching practice and one year
of courses in education and administration. The Academy would introduce new
teaching methods, carry out curriculum development projects aimed at im-
proved instruction in rural subjects in primary schools and teacher training
institutes and offer in-service training for supervisors.
4.03      Entrants would have a minimum of three years teaching experience.
Enrollment would be 400 with an annual output of 80-100. In rotation, 100
students would always be engaged in practice teaching away from the institu-
tion; boarding places therefore number 300. By 1980, it would provide the
primary school system with an adequate supply of teacher trainers and super-
visors.  The Academy would share the same campus with a new primary teacher
training institute of 540 students which would serve as a practice school.
4.04      (b)  Primary Teacher Training Institutes - In addition to the new
prinary teacher training institute mentioned in para. 4.03, the project
would include a new primary teacher training institute, with an enrollment
of 540 students in a two-year course, at Awassa in southwest Ethiopia. The
project would also extend the existing primary teacher training institute
at Asmara from its present capacity of 325 to 540. The activities of the
new and existing institutions would be closely integrated with present teach-
er training programs, including those of the Academy of Pedagogy.
4.05      (c)  Junior Secondary Teacher Training Institute - This new insti-
tution, to be located at Nazareth, south of Addis Ababa, for 640 students,
would train teachers for junior secondary schools in academic and practical
subjects in a two-year course following grade 12. Curriculum development
and equipment and textbook production projects for junior secondary educa-
tion would be included in the activities of the institution. It would also
have in-service training schemes for secondary school principals and teach-
ers as well as an extension service for former graduates from the institute
in order to reduce the attrition rate among teachers.



- 12 -
4.06      Adequate links need to be established between the Academy of
Pedagogy, the Junior Secondary Teacher Training Institute, the Ilaile
Selassie I University, Ministries and other establishments involved in
teacher training. Assurances were given by the government during nego-
tiations that satisfactory arrangements for the coordination of teacher
training activities in the country will be made within one year from the
date of effectiveness of the credit agreement.
4.07      The UNDP/Special Fund is expected to provide technical assistance
for the Academy of Pedagogy. For the Junior Secondary Teacher Training In-
stitute, the governmnet may obtain technical assistance from SIDA. In view
of the uncertainty of the SIDA assistance, however, provision is made for
such assistance in the proposed project.
General Secondary Education
4.08      The project would provide 12 new secondary schools; extensions for
19 general secondary schools; and multipurpose assembly halls to 23 similar
schools as a form of interim assistance to secondary education, pending a
comprehensive replanning of the education system. These items would assist
the government to make better use of existing facilities through the intro-
duction of a double-shift system, improve quality through a wider implementa-
tion of the diversified curriculum and spread educational opportunities to
new developing areas.
4.09      Of the 12 new secondary schools, 9 are in rural areas and 3 are
in urban centers. The curriculum of each school will be tailored to its
environment to the maximum extent possible. In rural areas emphasis will
be placed on agriculture and home economics while in urban areas industrial
art and commerce will be emphasized. The extensions to the 19 schools
would consist of laboratories and workshops, a limited number of classrooms
and equipment. These additions would provide 4,000 new places in single
shift. The construction of multipurpose halls in 23 schools is to allow
double-shift working by providing accommodation for out-of-class study and
extra curricular activities for students during that part of the day when
they do not receive classroom instruction.
Rural Education Institutes
4.10      The three Rural Education Institutes - of which one would result
from the extension and conversion of an existing secondary school - would be
a departure from traditional secondary education since they would offer a
practically oriented agricultural training both to primary school leavers
and to adults. The curriculum outline of the primary school leavers program,
already approved by the government, makes provision for a two-year course in-
cluding practical work for fifty percent of the time, the remainder being de-
voted to basic subjects of junior secondary education. Services to adults
would include community development and agricu1tural extension work. The
former would provide instruction in literacy, rura' handicrafts, leadership,
citizenship, together with lessons on nutrition and other aspects of home



- 13 -
economics for women. During negotiations assurances were given by the gov-
ernment that the draft curricula will be forwarded to the Association for
its review within one year from the signing of the Credit Agreement.
Agricultural Education
4.11      (a)  Agricultural Institutes - The project would provide facili-
ties at the Ambo and Jimma Agricultural Institutes for:  (i) two-year agri-
cultural teacher training courses for 100 students at Jimma; (ii) one-year
agricultural machinery courses for 20 students at Jimma; and (iii) one-year
animal production technicians' courses for 20 students at Ambo. Enrollment
at the Institutes would be increased from 300 to 390 students.
4.12      (b)  Agricultural Training Centers - The three new agricultural
training centers, to be financed as part of the project, would each provide
accommodation for 40 students in a nine-month practical course for field as-
sistants. They would be administered in close collaboration with the exten-
sion service. The sites have been selected in areas with major regional dif-
ferences in ecology and culture and close to the main research stations at
lioletta, Tigre and Alem Maya. The students would have a minimum age of 19
and completed junior secondary education. The course, to be taught by ex-
perienced extension agents, would be directly related to the type of agricul-
ture that is within reach of average farmers. Short courses for farmers
would be organized with the aid of the students. The centers would also be
used for in-service training for Ministry of Agriculture staff.
Boarding Facilities and Staff Housing
4.13      The proposed project would contain boarding accommodation for
2,525 students and 64 staff houses, the cost of which would amount to about
16, of the total project cost.  No boarding facilities would be provided
for the general secondary schools. The remaining institutions, however, are
of a national or regional character, enrolling students from widely dispersed
areas and, in view of the absence of suitable living accommodation near the
school, boarding facilities need to be provided.
4.14      Staff houses are provided at agricultural schools, rural institutes
and secondary schools in areas where houses for rent are not available. Staff
houses for the Academy of Pedagogy and the Junior Secondary Teacher Training
Institute are for foreign staff participating in the technical assistance pro-
grams for these schools.
Technical Assistance
4.15      Technical assistance, amounting to 53-1/12 man/years, is included in
the project and described in detail in an Appendix. Assurances have been giv-
en by government that (a) firms, agencies and experts employed in the techni-
cal assistance program financed under the project and their terms of reference
will be acceptable to the Association; (b) qualified counterparts will be as-
signed to the experts; and (c) sufficient local staff will be provided for the
education and manpower surveys.

Cost of the Project
4.16      The cost estimates for school buildings in the proposed project
are based on examples of school building contracts from the final phase of
the first IDA project, information obtained from public and private enter-
prises and other relevant facts. The estimated construction costs - free
of customs duties - per m2 gross area (Addis Ababa prices, March 1970) were
the following: (i) US$ 56 for schools and institutes with standards similar
to corresponding establishments in the first project but with allowance for
improvements; (ii) US$ 76 for institutes which need special design and con-
struction (the Academy of Pedagogy, its Primary Teacher Training Institute
and the Junior Secondary Teacher Training Institute at Nazareth); and (iii)
US$ 40 for farm buildings. Local cost adjustments are added to the figures.
4.17      The estimated costs of the various parts of the proposed project
are sumnarized in page 15 and in Annex 12:

4.18      The average annual increase in construction costs is estimated
at about 6% during the implementation period. Contingencies for construc-
tion, technical assistance, project unit and maintenance section costs
therefore include 14% against the likely rise in prices during the project
implementation period and 4% for unforeseen events (Annex 13). The contin-
gencies allowance for furniture and equipment is 10% to allow for price
escalation during implementation. The estimated foreign exchange component
for building (40%) and site development (20%) includes directly imported
materials, the estimated foreign exchange component of locally produced
materials and the depreciation of the contractors' imported plant over the
construction period.
4.19      Furniture and equipment cost estimates were reviewed for all
schools. Reasonable bulk costs for these categories of goods have been
established and included in the project cost but detailed lists with
itemized costs will be compiled during the design stages and supplied to
IDA for review before procurement.

These unit costs compare favorably with similar buildings in
neighboring countries. For instance, in the Sudan project financed under
Credit 112-SU estimated unit costs in teacher training schools are US$1,749
for academic and communal and US$598 for boarding accommodation.
4.21      The additional recurrent expenditure generated by the project would
be about Eth$8.7 million or 6.5% of the projected Central Government expend-
iture on education in 1975-76.
V. IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENTS
5.01      The proposed project would be implemented during 1971-1975 and
construction completed about 3-1/2 years after the credit becomes effective
(Annex 14). Civil works contracts would be awarded and equipment and furn-
iture procured on the basis of international competitive bidding. For civil
works, bids would be invited for groups of schools or for single units to
allow tendering by both international and Ethiopian contractors on one single
unit or several units within the group of schools in each bid invitation.
All civil works contracts are expected to be awarded to local firms.
Professional Services
5.02      Project implementation requires the employment of professional
services beyond present government resources. A firm of architectural con-
sultants, acceptable to IDA, will therefore be needed for design work and
the supervision of construction of four out of the five teacher training in-
stitutions. The remaining project schools are similar to those in the first
education project and design and supervision will be undertaken by the Proj-
ect Unit.
The Project Unit
5.03      A project unit, already established for the execution of the first
project, is headed by a project manager who is a Vice Minister of Education.
He is supported by a full-time project coordinator. SIDA has supplied the
unit with an architect, three engineers and a number of supporting staff.
Since SIDA aid may not continue, provision would be made under the proposed
project for an architect to assist the project unit for four years. During
negotiations assurances were given by the government that the posts of (a)
project manager; (b) project coordinator; and (c) project architect, the
last named two to be full-time posts, and an accountant and necessary sup-
porting staff will be appointed to the project unit. The project manager,
the project coordinator and the project architect will be mutually accept-
able to the government and the Association. The project manager and the
project coordinator would be appointed before the credit is declared ef-
fective. The project unit would (i) coordinate and supervise the execu-
tion of the project; (ii) control costs, variation orders, and progress of
work and (iii) coordinate with other parties concerned, including the Min-
istry of Agriculture.

5.04      Local firms of furniture manufacturers would produce many items
of school furniture. Improved design and specifications of furniture would
be prepared by the consultants during the design stages of the project items.
5.05      Sites for all the new schools and for the extensions in the proj-
ect have been selected and are satisfactory except for the secondary schools
at Goba, Fenoti Selam, Bahr Dar, Bonga and Debre Sina. During negotiations,
assurances were given by the government that adequate land for these schools
will be acquired and evidence of legal title received by the Association
within one year of the signing of the Credit Agreement.
5.06      In order to improve maintenance, assurances were given during
negotiations that a sufficient annual sum will be included in the budgets
of the Ministries of Education and Agriculture for the maintenance of the
project schools and that a special section for maintenance will be estab-
lished within the Construction Department of the Ministry of Education, to
initiate and implement adequate maintenance procedures. To help bring about
improved maintenance for schools in the first project and the proposed proj-
ect, the proposed credit would include provision for one man-year of tech-
nical assistance to establish and organize this maintenance section.
5.07      The total cost of the project is estimated at $13.4 million of
which the foreign exchange component comprises $7.3 million. The proposed
IDA credit of $9.5 million would cover 71% of the project cost, including
the whole of the foreign exchange costs and a portion of the local currency
cost.
5.08      The estimated disbursement schedule is shown at Annex 15.  The
proposed credit of US$9.5 million would be disbursed to meet:
(a)  100% of the direct identifiable c.i.f. costs of imported
furniture, equipment and construction materials;
(b)  100% of the foreign expenditure cost of technical assis-
tance; and
(c)  44% of total costs of civil works, locally procured furni-
ture and equipment and architectural services.
In the event that expenditure should exceed the present estimated cost of
US$13.4 million, these percentages would be adjusted so that withdrawals
from the credit would not exceed US$9.5 million. Savings in any category
would be available to cover overruns in any other category. Undisbursed
amounts would be available for cancellation.
5.09      Retroactive disbursement would be allowed for the professional
services for the design of the Academy of Pedagogy and the Junior Secon-
dary Teacher Training Institute. These project items have been initiated
in order to meet urgent needs and to meet the UNDP/SF schedule for techni-
cal assistance to the Academy of Pedagogy. The amount of expenditure
incurred before the Credit Agreement is approved which would be eligible
for retroactive financing is not expected to exceed US$100,000.

VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During credit negotiations, agreement was reached on the follow-
ing principal points:
(a) establishment, within the Ministry of Education, of an agri-
cultural education unit and of a school maintenance section
(paras. 1.15 and 5.08);
(b) revision of the student timetable, introduction of double-
shift working and future expansion of secondary education
enrollment (paras. 2.03, 2.06 and 3.03);
(c) coordination of teacher training activities (para. 4.06);
(d) curricula for the Rural Education Institutes (para. 4.09);
(e) technical assistance for manpower studies, an education
sector survey, technical and agricultural education and
project implementation (paras. 4.15, 5.03 and Appendix);
and
(f) acquisition of sites for project schools (para. 5.05).
6.02      A condition for effectiveness of the credit is the appointment by
the Government of the project manager, the project coordinator and the proj-
ect architect (para. 5.03).
6.03      Retroactive disbursement would be allowed for professional serv-
ices related to the design of the Academy of Pedagogy and the Junior Second-
ary Teacher Training Institute (para. 5.09).
6.04      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a Development
Credit of US$9.5 million equivalent to the Empire of Ethiopia for a term of
50 years including a 10 year grace period.

APPENDIX
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
1.        Systera:ic educational planning has been hampered by lack of
comprehensive manpower data. Structural imbalances in the education
and training system are such that the output is in many instances qual-
itatively and quantitatively untrained for productive employment. The
rapid enrollment growth has also resulted in a considerable burden on
public finance. Replanning and upgrading of the education system as well
as manpower planning are needed.
2.        The manpower survey currently being conducted by the Department
of Labor, Ministry of National Community Development and Social Affairs,
is to be complemented by three studies on: (a) changes in the level of
employment; (b) the educational profile of the labor forces; and (c) the
functioning of the labor market. Technical assistance has been included
in the project to assist the conduct of these studies parallel to the edu-
cation survey and their completion before the preparation of the Fourth
Five Year Development Plan.
3.        Technical assistance for an education survey is included in the
project, which would have the following objectives:
(a) to analyze the education and training system of Ethiopia
and its capacity to promote economic, social and cultural
developments efficiently; and
(b) to suggest ways to improve and expand the education and
training system within the limits of available resources
in capital and manpower to make it relevant both to the
society and to the overall development of the country.
Under a Development Planning Project financed by UNDP, a manpower/human
resources adviser will be assigned to the Planning Commission and an edu-
cational planning adviser will be assigned to the Ministry of Education.
Their long-term assignment will assist the replanning of the education and
training system resulting from the completion of the manpower studies and
of the education sector review.
4.        Technical assistance in agricultural education would provide
expert services in agricultural education and teacher training for Jimma
and Ambo Agricultural Institutes and the three agricultural training cen-
ters included in the project. The expert services would also assist the
section in the Ministry of Education dealing with agricultural education
matters and arrange for its coordination with the Department of Agricultural
Education in the Ministry of Agriculture.



- 2 -
5.        Technical assistance for technical education would provide the
trade schools at Addis Ababa and Asmara - included in the first IDA educa-
tion project - with expert teachers of mechanical engineering, civil engi-
neering and electrical engineering. The experts would also assist the
school principals in school organisation, liaison with industry and the
development of curricula suited to the needs of students and employers.
6.        Technical assistance to the Junior Secondary Teacher Training
Institute at Nazareth would provide expert services in (a) administration
and organization of teacher training, (b) in-service training and extension
work, and (c) expert teachers in the following subject areas: language,
social science, science and mathematics, industrial arts, commerce and home
economics.
7.        Technical assistance has been included in the project to assist
the Government to establish maintenance procedures and a maintenance sec-
tion in the Ministry of Education. Experience from the first education
project shows that maintenance of schools buildings and equipment is un-
satisfactory.
8.        The proposed project would therefore include the cost of 531/12
man-years of special services. Total cost is estimated at about US$1.87
million and the implementation period is about four years (Annex 16). De-
tails of the implementation program and terms of reference for the experts
were discussed and agreed upon during negotiations.
9.        The program would consist of the following experts (numbers in
parentheses indicate man-years if not otherwise indicated):
Cost-US$ equivalent
(a)  Education survey (37 man months) one                   120,000
economist-human resources expert (9
months), one socio anthropologist-
demographer (5 months), one general
educator (7 months), one industry-
commerce expert (4 months), one
agriculture expert (4 months), one
mass-media expert (4 months), one
management expert (4 months).
(b)  Manpower studies (3); one labor market                 160,000*
analyst (1); one occupational analyst
(1): one statistician (1).
(c)  Agricultural education (5); one expert on              120,000
agricultural education, planning and tea her
training (3); external fellowship for one
year (2);
*    Includes supporting services



- 3 -
(d)  Technical education (18); two mechanical               630,000
engineers (6); two civil engineers (6); two
electrical engineers (6);
(e)  Junior secondary teacher training (19); one            665,000
advise; to the principal (3); one curriculum
development expert (3); one expert on in-service
training and extension (1); expert teachers in
languages, social science, science and mathe-
matics, industrial arts, commerce, home
economics (12);
(f)  School maintenance section (1); one building            35,000
maintenance specialist; during two periods
of six months (1):
(g)  Project Unit (4); one project architect.               140,000
Total          1,870,000
10.       The Government has submitted a request to the UNDP/SF for tech-
nical assistance for the Academy of Pedagogy at Bahr Dar (para. 4.07), and
has also requested technical assistance from SIDA for the Junior Secondary
Teacher Training Institute at Nazareth. In the event that satisfactory
arrangements are concluded with SIDA technical assistance for the Institute
would be deleted fromi this project (para. 4.07).
11.       The technical assistance program would be a flexible one.  Within
the total amount allocated to technical assistance and subject to IDA agree-
ment, the length of the specialists' services could be varied as needs and
circumstances may warrant over the project period.
