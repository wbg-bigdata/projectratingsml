1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. History of the Project
The hydropower potential of the lower Yalong River was recognized in the early 1950s, but
detailed geological investigations did not begin until 1973. In 1980, a wide range of studies
was initiated by Sichuan Provincial authorities to assess the feasibility of a hydroelectric dam
at Ertan, near the mouth of the Yalong, and in early 1984 a feasibility report was submitted
to the State Planning Commission. One response to the report was that it was necessary to
undertake detailed planning for the resettlernent of people whose homes and lands were to
be inundated.
The World Bank was approached by the Chinese government in 1987 with a view to solicit
a loan for the project. and in May 1988, a Pre-Appraisal Mission was conducted by Bank-
staff. This mission provided to the Govemment of China guidelines and suggestions for
further studies necessary for satisfactory appraisal. The Bank Appraisal Mission was
conducted in December 1988. and their report was completed in March 1990. The report
was approved by the Government of China in April. In July 1991. the Executive Board of
the World Bank approved a first-phase loan of S380 million, and two months later the
construction contractors began moving to the site to initiate construction activities. In Julv
1993. the World Bank and the Ertan Hydroelectric Development Corporatlon (EHDC)
opened discussions on the second-phase loan of S500 million.  The World Bank
Pre-Appraisal Mission for the second-phase loan was conducted in April 1994, and the
Appraisal Mission is scheduled for October 1994.

In November 1993, the Yalong River was successfully diverted into the two diversion
tunnels. The first electricity is expected to be generated in mid-1997, and the project
completed in mid-1999.
1.2. Justification of the Project
Sichuan Provir.-e is very rich in hydro power resources and relatively poor in other energy
resources, but is severely lacking in geneadng capacity. In 1985, the total installed
generating capaity in Sichuan was 2,880 MW (including both coal-fired thermal stations and
hydropower stations) providing a firm capacity of 1,500 - 1,600 MW. Demand for energy
was estimated at approximately 2,000 MW during the dry season each year. Provincial
planning for additional industry in Sichuan revealed that by 1995, a maximum system
demand of 6,500 MW and by the year 2000, the system demand is expected to reach 11,000
MW. To meet these demands, an installed generating capacity of 9,500 MW would be
needed by 1995, and 14,000 MW would be needed by the year 2000.
In a report prepared by the Chengdu Hydroelectric Investigation and Design Institute
(CHIDI) in 1994, these estimates were updated by the CHIDI. According to the report, the
demand for electricitv reached 6,900 MW (42,070 CWh) in 1992 and Sichuan Province
experienced an energy shortage of approximately 7,000 GWh. Since 1985. the total installed
generating capacity in Sichuan increased to 9,545 MW of which 4.089 MW is derived from
hydropower projects and 5.476 is derived from thermal (coal-fired) plants. Total vield from
the hydroelectric projects was 21,940 GWh while thermal plants produces only '0.5 13 G.'h
for a total energy production of 41.940 GWh in 1992. Between 1992- and the year '020. the
demand for power is expected to increase nearly 10-fold from 6.900 MW to 6_.000 MIW
with an estimated generating requirement of over 340,000 GWh. Confronted with these
projections, the need to develop additional sources of electric energy is critical to continued
economic growth in the Province of Sichuan.
During preliminary studies leading to the selection of the Ertan Dam, the total energy
potential of the Yalong River was estimated at over 20,000 MW. Development of potential

generating capaity in the Yalong Basin, therefore, became a prime altenative for meeting
the growng demand for power in Sichuan Province. Preliminary studies of the development
of hydropower resources in the Yalong Basin were conducted by CHIDI. Results of these
studies indicaed that Xte hydropower resources of the Yalong River could be developed in
two phases. The fis phase will consist of the construction of 11 projects in the lower
Yalong River. The second phase will complete the development of the hydroelectric
resources in the basin and will indude an additional 10 projects upstream from the first phase
dams. Based on the results of this study, the Ertan Hydroeectric Project was selected as the
first of the 11 phase one projects to be constructed. The Ertan Pmject is designed to
contribute 3,300 MW of installed generating capacity, and more than 1,000 MW of firm
capacity, to the Sichuan electric distribution system.
In addition to the direct contribution of over 1,000 MW of firm capacity to the Sichuan
Power System, the regulation of the river resulting from the Ertan Project will increase the
system-wide finn capacity by 142 MW at the Gezhouba Hydroelectric Project and by 230
MW at the (planned) Three Gorges Project on the Yangatze River in western Hubei Province
and eastern Sichuan Province, respectively. This increase in firm capacity is derived
primarily from the increase flow during the dry months attributable to the limited storage
capacity in tile Ertan Reservoir.
1.3. Analvsis of Alternative Energy Sources
The provincial government decision to pursue hydroelectric development in Sichuan Province
was based on a comprehensive analysis of available energy resources within the province and
an economic analvsis to find the most efficient source of energy to meet the growing demand
for power as Sichuan develops into the modern world. These analyses focused on available
energy resources in Sichuan Province: water, coal, gas, and oil. Additionally, the economic
benefits of constructing fewer large scale projects vs
many small projects was evaluated. Results of these analyses are presented in a report
prepared by CHDI ir. 1994 and are briefly summarized below.

As shown in Table 1. 1, potential water power developments comprise over 75 percent of the
available energy reserves in Sichuan Province with available coal reserves accounting for less
than 25 percent of the exploitable energy resources. In direct comparison, continued
development of coal resources to generate electricity would ultimately lead a requirement
for importing coal from outside the province. As a matter of Provincial policy, available
natural gas reserves are targeted for industrial and domestic use (displacing urban coal use)
rather than for the generation of electric power. Therefore, from this perspective alone, the
decision to pursue development of hydropower resources to meet the growing energy
shortage in Sichuan Province appears to be a highly desirable alternative.
From an economic standpoint. development of hvdropower resources appears to be the most
viable alternative for Sichuan Province. This economic factor is illustrated bv direct
comparison of the estimated costs for the 3,300 MW Ertan Project with those for a 2860
MW  coal-fired thermal project. each project providing a firm generating capacity of
apprcxinately 1.000 %IW. The capital and operating costs for these two energy sources are
summarized in Table 1.2. All costs estimated are based on the value of the Chinese yuan
in 1991 (5.45 RMB M = Sl.00 US). Clearly the initial capital investment required to
construct either of these two projects favors a coal fired generating facility. However, this
advantage decreases markedly once the projects begin generating. A quick calculation
indicates that the economic difference between a coal-fired plant and the Ertan Project
31 12                                1.4

disappears within 5 years of operation. The difference between the capital costs is 3,350 x
106 fi whereas costs for .5ve years of hydro operation are 3,685 x 106 V.
Over 20 years of operation (the approximate expected life of a coal-fired project) the total
costs (capital and operating expenses in 1991 RMB V) clearly favors the hydroelectric
project with an estimated cost savings of over 18 billion RMB ' (this difference does not
account for financing or escalation costs).

From an overall environmental perspective, the selection of hydropower generation over coal-.
fired thermal generation becomes even more obvious. Water is a renewable resource is in
abundant supply. Coal. on the other hand, is a finite, non-renewable resource. From a
purely physical-presence perspective, hydropower clearly requires commitment of relatively
large tracts of land resources. However. once a hydropower project is constructed. the
impoundment can be exploited to provide additional benefits to the project (in the form of
fisheries, transportation, recreation, and water supply).  Establishment of effective
environmental safeguards and implementation of appropriate resource management techniques
(in compliance with national regulations and policies) can prowide considerable opporturity
to preserve and restore natural and cultural resources within a buffer zone around the
impoundment. In contrast, while a coal-fired plant will occupy a smaller land area for the
physical plant, additional land resources must be committed to mines, mining wastes.

transport, and ash disposal. In addition, burning of coal contributes significandy to air
pollution in the form of particulates, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen compounds and
benzo [a] pyrene. Annual producdon of these byproducts of coal are summarized in Table
1.3. Efforts to control disperal of ftese pollutants into the environment is costly and not
necessarily effective.
Construction of a single large project, such as Ertan, also provides an economy of scale
relative to the construction of a number of smaller projects. The relationship between the
capital investment and size of a hydroelctric project is depicted in Figure 1.1. Data used
for this figure are derived from design and feasibility studies of 49 hydroelectric projects at
various stages of development in Sichuan Province.

At a maximum generating capacity of 3,300 MW, the Ertan Hydr--Ietric Project ranks as
one of the major hydroelectric projects in the world in terms of instaled generating capacity.
In comparison with other world-class hydroelectric project, Ertan is at the top in relation to
the least area inundated per MW and fewest number of human displacements (oustees) per
MW. A summary of available information for other projects throughout the world is

1.5. History of the Environmental Assessment
Studies to support the environmental impacts assessment (EA) of the Ertan Hvdroelectric
Proiect began in 1980 concurrent with other feasibility studies. Most of the investigations
and literature searches were conducted between 1980 and 1985 by the CHIDI. in cooperation
with relevant scientific institutes. professional universities and colleges. The draft of the EA
met stautory requirements and was submitted to the National Environmental Protection
Agency in August 1985. In March 1986, the report was reviewed by a group of 78 domestic
experts, engineers, and environmental administrators at the invitation of the Construction
Committee of Sichuan Province. This group agreed with the conclusions of the EA, and

recognized the huge economic benefits of the project, the physical appropriateness of the site,
the lack of sepage, the economic potentials, and the lack of additional threats to endangered
wildlife. The full text of the EA was translated into English for the use during the World
Bank Appaisal Mission in May 1988.
1.6. Introduction to this Study              -               _
The 1989 version of the Ertan Environmental Assessment (EA) was reviewed during the
Pre-Appraisal mission of the Worfd- Bank for the second phase loan in April 1994. The
World Bank concluded -that, since global standards for such reports had been raised
substantially during the previous decade, it was necessary to review the information and
revisE the conclusions contained in the 1989 report to comply more closely with present
requirements of the World Bank.
In parallel with the preparation of this document and preparation for the World Bank
Appraisal Mission in October 1994, an environmental assessment of the transmission line
system to distribute power generated at Ertan was prepared by the Sichuan Electric Power
Association to support a request for funding from the World Bank to construct the facilities.
The Transniissiora Line EA is presented separately (SEPA. 1994). Consequently, the
environmental impacts associated with the transmission line are not addressed in the main
body of this EA and the reader is referred to the Transmission Line EA for discussion of the
anticipated impact.
The information contained in this document addresses the environment. potential impacts and
mitigation measures associated with the construction and operation of the Ertan Dam and
Hydroelectric Facilities. A summary of the Resettlement Action Plan is also provided within
the text of this document. The revised, detailed Resettlement Action Plan is presented as a
separate document in support of the application for the second phase loan from the World
Bank.

To accomplish the revision and update of cne Ertn Environmental Assessment, EHDC
contracted with Ham Engineering International, LP (USA) for two environmental specialiss
(Drs John R. Bizer, Harza; and Anthony Whitten, Diversity Matters) to work with EHDC,
CHIDI, and Sichuan Provincial Resetlement Agency personnel. The draft EA was reviewed
by EHDC, CHIDI and was given a preliminary review by the World Bank. Comments of
these groups were incorporated into this final document by Dr. Bizer, who completed the
document in September1994.

2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.1. General Project Description
Ertan Hydroelectric Project is located in Panzhihua Municipality on the lower reaches of the
Yalong River in south-western Sichuan Province (Figure 2.1). It is a comprehensive
development with power generation as its primary objective. It is planned to be the
penultimate dam in a cascade of eleven dams along the Yalong River (Figure 2.2). These
damns comprise the first stage in the development of hydro resources of the Yalong River.
Ultimately, ten additional sites in the upper Yalong have also been identified and may be
developed as part of a second stage deveopment program. When aU of the 21 sites are
developed, the total installed capacity in the Yalong River Basin will be 22,650 MW.
Construction of Ertan is expected to tak-e ten years from the start of construction to the
commissioning of the first of six power units in 1998. T'he Ertan project will supply
electricity to the Sichuan and Yunnan power systems via a 500 kIV transmission line system
currently under design and construction (see SEPA 1994 for EA and project description).
The system will provide energy to load centers in Zigong, Chengdu, Yibin Xichang,
Chongquin. and numerous smaller load centers along the transmission corridors. Panzhihua
and Xichang will also be supplied with electricity for the smelting of vanadium and titanium.
The Yalong River is a lar=e tributarv of the linsha River, which rises in Yushu Countv of
Qinrhai Province. From its origin. the river generally flows southward as it passes through
the western portion of Sichuan to its confluence with the Jinsha River near Panzhihua City.
The Yalong valley is at the eastern extreme of the Himalayan Range. The geology and
topography of this anrea is characteristic of very young mountain ranges in geological terms
.vith geologic folding and movement continuing. The geology of the valley is varied,
comprised of old Permian basalt, younger intrusive granites. and young sedimentary marl and
shale. The total length of the Yalong River mainstem is 1500 km, with a total catchment

area of 130,000 Icn2 - somewhat larger Ohan New York State in the US, slightly smaller than
Nepal, and more than half the area of Great Britain. The catchment area comprises 27.5
percent of the Jinsha catchment. The mean flow at the mouth of the Yalong River is 1800
m3/sec, and the mean runoff is 56.8 x 109 m3. The length of the river above the Ertan
damsite is about 1470 km and encompasses some 90 percent of the catchment. The power
station is just over 40 km from Panzhihua City and 18 km upstream from Tongzilin Station
on the Chengdu-Kunming Railway line.
2.2. Physical Plant
2.2.1. Dam and Spillway
The dam area is located in a 1 km-long gorge between the Jinlong and Zhongtan Streams on
the lower Yalong River (Figure 2.3). The valley is V-shaped with left and right bank- slopes
of 25-40a and 30W450 respectively. The Ertan damsite is characterized by a narrow river
channel with a high discharge. The bedrock within the dam site is composed of Permian
basalt. svenite intruding into basalt. and altered basalt formed bv the intrusion.
The dam will be a double curvature arch dam with a maximum heiaht of 240 m, and a
maximum static height of 188 m. The dam will impound a reservoir that will extend
approximately 143 km upstream from the dam site, have a surface area of 10.100 ha. and
a normal maximum operating level of 1200 m above mean sea level.
The dam is equipped with four sets of spillway structures to facilitate release or excess
discharge and to enable evacuation of the reservoir under emergency conditions (Figure 2.4-
Three of the spillways are integral with the dam. The upper spillway, with crest elevation
at 1188.5 m. consists of 7 gates each with a hydraulic capacity of 900 m3/s. The second set
of spillwray gates, with crest elevation at 1120 m, consists of 6 gates each with a hydraulic
capacitv of 1160 m3/s. Both of these spillways will be used during the wet season when
inflow to the reservoir is greater than the hydraulic capacity of the 6 turbine/generator units.
The two spillways are designed to act in coordination to partially dissipate the energy as the

water falls into the plunge pool at the base of the dam. The third set of spillway gates in the
dam consists of 4 gates with crest elevations at elevation 1080 m.
The fourth spillway consists of two, low-level tunnels, each with crest elevations of 1165 m.
The hydraulic capacity of each tunnel is 3400 m31s. The two tunnels may be operated
independendy or in coordination with the upper and mid-level spillways to facilit  rapid
evacuation of the reservoir in emergency situations. The tunnel spillways will discharge to
the Yalong River approximately 800 m and 1200 m downstream from the dam, respectively.
Water discharged from the upper and mid-level spillway structures will faUl in to a plunge
pool area at the base of the dam. The plunge pool will be founded on bedrock and lined with
concrete. A low dam, approximately 300 m downstream from the base of the dam will
control the water elevation in the plunge pool. The crest of the plunge pool dam is at 1012
m. With the bottom of the plunge pool area at 980 m elevation, the total water depth
maintained in the plunge pool will be 32 m.
2.2.2. Powerhouse and Switchgear
An underground powerhouse with six turbine/generator units will be constructed. Each unit
will have a hydraulic capacity of 277 m3/sec and an installed generating capacity of 550
MIW. The total hydraulic capacity will be 1660 m31s and the installed generating capacity
will be 3300 MW.  The firm  generating capacity will be 1000 MW.  The six
rurbincfgenerator units will be conmined in an underground cavem measuring 296.24 M X
31.' m X 71 m. Each unit will be served by a 9 m diameter penstock. The centerline of
the intake for the penstocks will be at elevation 1132.5 m. The 6 draft tubes will discharge
water into a 94 m X 19.5 m X 70 m surge chamber which will-then direct the water into two
tailrace tunnels one 16.5 m in diameter and the other 23 m in diameLer. The two tailrace
tunnels will return water to the Yalong River channel approximately 800 m downstream fro;n
the base of the dam. Figure 2.5 presents a section through the intake, powerhouse and
tailrace of the Eran Power Station.

The transformers and switching gear for each of the geneator units will be housed in a
separate chamber located above the turbinedgenerator cavern. A shaft from the transformer
chamber to the surface will allow transmission of the power to the surface switch yard,
located immediately downstream from the dam above the left abutment.
2.2.3. Access Tunnels
Access to the underground facilities will be provided by a series of tunnels. The locations
of these tunnels are depicted in Figure 2.3.
In addition to the water convevance tunnels and access tunnels, a third tunnel will be
excavated on the left abutment of the dam. The purpose of this tunnel is to iouse conveyor
equipment for transporting harvested timber (mainly plantation timber) from the
impoundment to the tail water area. The log tunnel, with two inlets to take account of the
varying water surface height, will be 2450 m long. The tunnel will be used each year
beginning in June when the logs start arriving from upstream. The log transfer process will
continue for approximately three months during which the logs will be transferred from the
reservoir to the downstream reach of the Yalong River.
2.2.4. Access Roads and Bridges
Prior to project construction, the main road in the Yalong River Valley was located along
the left bank of the river. Prior to construction of the dam and powerhouse, a 10.5 m-wide
paved road was constructed from the Tongzilin Railroad Station to the damsite along the right
bank via a new bridge. This road is being extended to the Ganyu vallev as part of the
compensation paclage to Yanbian county. The left bank road is also being improved to 5-6
m-wide and another bridge was built at Santan to accommodate the flow of traffic associated
with project construction and operation.  The right bank road was constructed to
accommodate the 20-ton cement trucks and the 35-ton dump trucks required for construction
and deliverv of proqject equipment.

2.2.5. Other Appurtenances
Because of the steepness of the valley and the consequent shortage of suitable construction
staging sites, it has been necessry to adopt advanced site organization features involving
highly mechanized construction methods to reduce construction labor and time. Facilities for
promoting construction activities include on-site concrete batch plants, and machinery
assembly sites. Concet for dam construction will be transported from the batch plant to
the dam site via a cable way constructed across the Yalong River valley.
2.3. Reservoir
Ertan Reservoir will be a typical river-channel reservoir with a storage capacity of 5.8x109
m3, and an active storage of 3.3ix109 m3 of water. Mountain slopes on both banks of the
planned reservoir are steep with peaks rising to 1500 m above the eventual water surface.
The width of the reservoir is generally about 400 m in the lower part of the reservoir. In
the Ganyu Arm, in Yanbian County, the reservoir will be as much as 1,000 m across in
some areas.
When the reservoir is filled to its maximum level of 1,200 m. its total length from the dam
to the back-water on the Yalong River will be 143 km. and the length from the mouth of the
Ganyu to the backwater on the Ganyu River will be 40 km. The maximum reservoir area
will be 101 km- (10. 100 ha) (Figure 2. 1).
Thirty-one villages and approximatelv 30,000 people will be affected (Resettlement Action
Plan. 1994). 92% of whom live in the rural areas. The human population density in the area
of the Yalong River to be inundated is about 80 persons/km". The land use rate in the
reservoir area is about 16 percent.
Along the middle reaches of the Ganyu River the land to be inundated comprises wide and
gentle terraces, and the human population affected by the reservoir is concentrated here (630
persons/kM2) with cultivaLed land accounting for 36 ha/km-. Outside this area the human
MNAC                                2.10



population is scattered (80 persons/lan2) with cultivated land accounting for just 10 ha/km2.
Along the main Yalong River, scattered trees dominate the landscape on the left bank, while
grassy slopes dominate on the right bank. Both banks have scattered areas of culdvated land
wherever the slopes are more gentle.
2.4. Construdion Methods-
2.4.1. Diversion Works
Year-round dam construction is made possible by the construction of two diversion tunnels,
one on each bank, and of non-overflow cofferdams upstream and downstream of the main
dam site. Diversion tunnels 1230-1315 m long, 18 m wide and 23-25 m high were excavated
into the left and right abutments. During construction the diversion tunnels are able to
convey the logs floating downstream, but only when the water is below 1036 m. Above that
level the logs will be stored in the reservoir created by the cofferdam. The river was closed
successfully in November 1993, two weeks ahead of schedule. The diversion works required
the excavation of 1.23 million m3 of rock, and the placement of 0.33 million m3 of concrete.
2.4.2. Main Structures
T he main structures are divided into four independent groups to improve efficiencv: the arch
dam. the underground powerhouse, the spillway tunnels. and the mechanical log pass.
2.4.2.1.    Arch Dam
The excavation of the side abutments was accomplished by blasting, drilling, pre-splitting,
and using excavators, dump trucks, shotcrete, and support bolts. Over 2.3 million m3 of
open rock cut was displaced. The abutment excavation was completed, as planned, before
river closure. Similar methods will be used to excavate the dam foundations, plunge pool,
spillway tunnels foundations, and powerhouse intake.
rAA C                               2.11



The concrete for the dam will be mixed in the Jinlong Gully plant above and just upstream
of the dan. The concrete will be mixed at the construction site in 20-ton trucks. From the
batch plant, the concrete will be decanted into 6 m3 buckets suspended from high-speed
cableways. The buckets will be emptied into one of 47 blocks (the largest of which is 20x49
m) where the concrete will be consolidated using flat-boot vibrators. The dam will be 70 m
wide at its base. Once construction of the dam begins, the height of the dam will increase
approximately 5 m each month, on avesage. The dam will require 4.7 million m3 of
concrete grouting material, fully tested for the physical conditions of the site, will be used
to seal the concrete in the dam.
The concrete batch plant at the mouth of the Santan Gully will supply the concrete for the
plunge pool and end sill. The concrete will be hauled to the plunge pool area in 10 ton
trucks and distributed to the forms using high gantry cranes.
2.4.2.2.    Underground Powerhouse System
The underground powerhouse svstem includes the intake, penstock, powerhouse, main
transformer gallery, surge chamber, tail-race tunnel, and out-flow field. The structures
require removal of 0.9 million m3 of open cut rock, 1.9 million m3 of unconsolidated rock.
and placement of 0.8 million m3 of concrete. The maximum underground excavation rate
will be 0.5 million m3/lyr. The powerhouse will be built first. followed bv the surge
chamber. and then the main transformer gallery. The chambers will be excavated from the
top down, with excavated surfaces supported with bolts and shotcrete. Smooth blastino
procedures are to be used for the roof, while presplittine procedures will be used for the
middle and floor sections. The concrete for the intake and penstock will be supplied from
the Jinlona Gully batch plant. and the concrete for the underground facilities will be supplied
from the Santan Gully batch plant.
2.4.2.3.    Spillwav Tunnels
There will be two spillway tunnels, 60 m apart, in the right abutment. One tunnel will be
1250 m long and the other 1385 m. The construction of the tunnel will require removal of
HRTAJ FA MC                         2.12



0.9 million m3 of open cut rock, and the excavation of 0.6 million m:3 of unconsolidated
rock, and placement of 0.4 million m3 of concrete, and 24,000 m3 of shotrete. The tunnels
will be driven from both ends to meet in the middle, as was done for the diversion tunnels.
The concrete will be supplied from the Santan Gully batch plant. The schedule for
constructing these tunnels is relatively flexible because they are not on the critical pathway.
2.4.2.4.    Meical Log Pass
The mechanical log pass (the log tunnels) wil be equipped with two intakes leading to a
single transport tunnel 14 m wide and-I 1.5 m high. Construction of the facility will require
the clearance of 0.6 million m3 of open cut rock to form the staging areas, and the
excavation of 0.3 million m3 of underground rock. The tunnel will require placement of 0.3
million m3 of concrete to complete construction, 57,400 mn3 of which is in the tunnel.
2.4.3. Quarries
The existing rock material from both south and north sides of the dam site are of good
quality and will be used as aggregate in the concrete. The available reserves meet the total
volumes required for the project. Most of the dolomite aggregate will be obtained from Mt.
Bawang, 6 km upstream from the damsite. Supplementary aggregate will be obtained from
the spoil naterial at the dame site. The cement for the dam is derived from the Emei
Cement Plant, while the cement for other uses is produced at the Panzhihua Cement Works.
2.4.4. Camps
Housing facilities for the work fDrce are provided by EHDC near the construction area.
Four separate facilities are constructed. A contractor camp is located along the right side of
the Yalong River, approximately 6 km downstream from the dam axis. Three separate
camps are provided for the Chinese management and construction staff. These camps are
located at Santan Gullv on the left bank of the river downstream from the dam site, Santanda
Gully on the right bank across from Santan Gully, and near the Xiaodeshi gaging station
approximately 10 man downstream from the construction site. The Santan Gully camp houses

Chinese labores worldng on the dam and above ground facilities (Lot 1 Contract), the
Santanda Gully Camp house Chinese laborers constructing the underground facilities (Lot 2
Contract), and Xiaodeshi liouses EHDC staff. Each camp is fully equipped with housing,
eating facilities, drinking water treatment facilities, and wastewater treatment facilities.
2A.5. Labor
The labor required for completion is 29.6 million worker days, and the maximum number
of workers at any time will be 19,000, with an average of 11,100.
2.4.6. Materials
The total materials needed for completion are: 1.8 million tons of concrete, 0.1 m3 of
timber, 93.7 million tons of reinforcement bars, 541 million tons of steel products, 15,000
million tons of explosives, and 65,000 tons of fuel oils.
2.5. Project Operation
The dam will be operated in two modes: During the high flow, wet season, when inflow to
the reservoir is greater than the hydraulic capacity of the power station. the project will
provide base load capacitv. The turbines will be operated on a 24-hour basis and no
variation in output will be anticipated. Excess water will be discharged through the upper
and mid-level spillway structures.
During the dry. low-flow season, the Project will be operated on a daily peak-ing basis and
the energy will be generated to meet daily load demand variation in the system. Generally,
the turbines will be operated between 17 and 20 hours each day during dry and normal runoff
vears. During wet years, some generation will be maintained throughout the 24 hour period.
During the dry season period when the project is operated on a peaking basis, the reservoir
will be drawn down by a maximum of 45 m. Because the dry season lasts approximately 5
months, the maximum draw down rate will average 0.3 m/day. At the beginning of the high
MAEN A                              2.14



flow season, the project will be operated on a 24-hour basis but at a reduced capacity to
allow for refilling of thereservoir. It is expected that the refil period will begin on or about
June 1 each year and refil completed by the middle of July. When the reservoir is refilled,
the reservoir surface wuill zse an average of 1.0 mlday. Details of the proposed opewing
regime.are presented in Chapter 5.
2.5.1. Flood Discharge Pattern m
Four layout schemes of flood discharge and energy dissipation stuctures were considered in
the design. They were alU technically feasible, but the final choice wasgadouble curvature
arch dam with flood discharging from a surface spillway and a middle level outlet, with the
discharge streams meeting in the air to dissipate the energy. In comparison with the other
altematives, the scheme has the significant advantage of reasonable arrangement, flexible and
reliable operation, cost saving and short construction period.
2.6. Transmission Line and"Substations
The transmission distances from the Ertan plant to Panzhihua, Xichang, Yibin, Chengdu,
Chongqing will be 40, 150, 440, 670, and 670 km respectively.  A more complete
description of the transmission line system is presented in the Transmission Line
Environmental Assessment (SEPA, 1994).
2.7. Cost Summary
Prior to the start of construction, EHDC and CHIDI prepared design cost estimates for the
Ertan Project which was used in securing the Phase I loan from the World Bank and
matching funds from the National and Provincial governments. A summary of the costs is

3. POLICY, LEGAL, AND  ADMINISTRATIVE
FRAMEWORK
3.1. Environmental Protection
This environmental assesment is prepared in compliance with the requirements of the World
Bank. However, much of the work conducted in support of the Ertan Hydroelectric Project
is also in response to numerous laws and policies of the People's Republic of China and the
Sichuan Province. Principle laws and policies pertinent to the Eran Hydroelectric Project
are summarized below.
3.1.1. Legal Framework
3.1.1.1.    Environmental Protection  Law  of the People's
Republic of China. (December. 1989).
The law was formulated for the prevention of pollution and other public harms. and for
protecting and improving the ecological and social environments.  The definition of
*environment" here, is the sum of the natural environment and human-modified natural
environment, including atmospheric, water, ocean, land, mineral resources. forest. grassland.
wildlife. plants, natural and human remains. nature reserves. historic and scenic areas. and
urban and rural areas.
The law provides for the establishment of resource management agencies that are delegated
the responsibility of establishing environmental standards, monitoring the condition of the
resources, and developing measures to protect the resources.
95r A3
EItSIA Cm4                         3.1



The law further provides for review of construction and operation practices to assure
compliance with the environmental protection and mitigation measures specified for the
project.
3.1.1.2.    The Forest Law of the People's Republic of China
(Mrh, 19S9)..
Relevant aspects of this law include povision for the protection of forest lands within the
project area. Tne law was promulgated for the protection, cultivation, and reasonable use
of the forest resources. The policy established by the law provides for the reasonable
cutting, planting and renewal of managed forest areas and for the protection of natural
forested areas. The law forbids investigation, design, and construction of projects, as weU
as the exploitation of mineral resources that adversely affect forest land. If total avoidance
of damage is not possible, application must be made in accordance with applicable laws and
effective measures to minimize effects on forest lands must be incorporated into the project
plan. If the project occupies more than 133 ha of forest land, it must get approval from the
national government.
The forest law also provides for the protection of wildlife and plant resources. According
to the law. it is forbidden to kill or hunt protected species or to disturb protected plant
species.
3.1.1.3.    Wildlife Protection Law of the People's Republic of
China (March, 1989).
The Wildlife Protection Law is equivalent to an endangered species protection la>. It was
formulatcd to protect rare and endangered wildlife and to provide for the proper use of
wildlife resources and for maintaining their habimats.
98 11                                 3.2



3.1.1.4.    Water Law of the People's Republic of China
(January, 1988).
The Water Law was fomulUed for protctdon and proper use of water resources, for
prevention of water pollution, and to provide for the comprehensive development of water
resources to meet demands of national economic development goals and to provide for the.
quality of the human environment.
3.1.2. Regulations Implementing Environmental laws
3:1.2.1.    Environmental Protection Management Regulations
for Development Projects. (March, 1986)
These regulations were formulated to strengthen the administration of environmental
protection measures associated with water and land resource development projects. The
regulations provide for control of new polluuon sources and encourage treatment of original
pollution sources with the goal of protecting and imDroving existing environmental
conditions. The regulations are part of the implementation of the Environmental Protection
Law of the P.R. China.
The regulations apply to all capital construction projects, technical transfer and regional
development projects with environmental effects. They require the preparation, review and
approval of an environmental impact assessment at the same time the plans for the design.
construction and operation of a project are prepared. After completion of the project,
pollution discharges from the project must meet the relevant national or local standards.
The responsibility for implementing the laws and regulations lies with the environmental
protection agencies at all levels of the government. The agencies are responsible for
reviewing and approving the environmental assessment and proposed mitigation measures at
the same time the preliminary design is reviewed and approved. They must also approve the
monitoring program to be implemented during construction, examination and receiving of
E AtS^ E CH3                         3.3



environmental protection facilities after completion, and supervision and monitoring of
environmental protection facilities during project operation.
During construction, protection of the environment around the construction site is required
to prevent unreasonable adverse effects to the natural environment and to prevent and reduce
dust and noise. After completion of the project, the construction contractors are required to-
reclaim lands disturbed during project construction but unneeded during project operation.
3.1.2.2.    SpecIfications  of  the  Environmental  Inpact
Assessment Addressing Water Resources and
Hydropower Projects, Ministry of Energy and
Ministr) of Water Resources, People's Republic of
China (1988)
These regulations outline implementation of the National Environmental Protection Act for
Water Resource and Hydropower development projects. The regulations provide for the
preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement or an Environmental Impact Assessment
during the feasibility studies for the project. The EIS or EIA is to evaluate the likely impacts
of the project to physical and socio-economic environments and to specify measures to
mitigate or minimize adverse effects and to enhance positive effects.
For projects involving reservoirs. the EIA should discuss effects realized in the reservoir area
and its surroundinas as well as downstream reaches affected by project: 'eration. However.
the focus of the analysis should be on the reservoir area and its surroundings.
3.1.2.3.    Specifications  for  Reservoir  Bottom   Clearing
(November, 1986)
These regulations implement the Environmental Protection Laws with respect to the disposal
of materials removed from the inundation zones of water conservancy and hydropower
projects. The purpose is to ensure the safety of projects during operation, prevent pollution
"I 12
UT*I FA                               3.4



of the water, protect publich health in the vicinity of the project, facilitate use of the reservoir
for aquaculture, navigation, water-based recreation, and tourism. These specifications are
attained by clearing the reservoir area prior to inundation.
Clearing includes: removal of existing physical structwes and buildings, sanitary clearing,
removal of forest, and removal of special aspects specific to the various developments.
General clearing-of the reservoir area includes removal of houses, buildings and other
physical works such as bridge piez. and other major architectural structures. Special clearing
specifications cover areas selected for aquaculture, fishing, swimming, navigation lines,
piers, and water supply intake areas. *
3.1.2.4.     Environlmental Quality Standards for Surface Water
(GB383888)
These standards were developed to implement the water pollution prevention articles of the
National Environmental Protection Law and the Water Pollution Prevention and Treatment
Law of the People's Republic of China. This standard applies to all surface water of the
nation including rivers, lakes and reservoirs which have functional use in China.
The standards first provide for the classification of all water bodies according to their use and
existing conditions. Five classifications are defined:
Class 1:           Applies to source waters and national reserves
Class 11:          Applies to Class-A protection areas for concentrated drinking water
sources. areas protected for valuable and rare fishes and spawning
areas of fishes and other aquaculture species.
Class m:           Applies to Class B protection areas for concentrated drinking water
sources, areas for protecting common fishes and swimming areas.
EKrANd VA a3                          3.5



Class IV:         Applies to areas for industrial water supply and non-contact water
recreation.
Class V:          Applies to water used for iipgation or general landscape.
If a particular body of water is used for sevesal purposes, the use requiring the highest water
quality standard should apply. In some instances, a water body may be classified differently
during different seasons.
The Yalong River in the reach affected by the Ertan Project is placed in Class m. However,
upstream from Ertan, upstream from the provincial boundary, the Yalong is placed in Class
II. Reevant reaches of the Anning and 1insha are placed in Class m.
Standards for over 30 parameters are established for each of the five classifications. Also
included in this set of standards are specifications for the quality of treated drnking water.
3.1.2.5.    Regulations for Aquatic Resources Reproduction
Protection, Articles 4 and 13 (February, 1979)
The regulations for protecting aquatic resource reproduction apply to the protection of all
valuable aquatic fauna and flora and their habitats. Several of the regulations are relevant
to the evaluation and planning for the Ertan Hydroelecuic Project.
Anicle 4 of the regulations provide for particular consideration of certain marine and
freshwater fish during t'e planning for water resource project development. including
hydropower. Specific freshwater fish species that are protected by these regulations include:
Common carp                    Cprinus carpio
M,ylophaiyngodon piceus
Grass carp                     Cenopharyngodon idellus

Article 13 of the Aquatic Resources Reproduction Protection Regulations provides for the
consideration of providing for passage of migratory fish species. If such species are affected
by construction of a dam, the need for fish passage facilities must be determined prior to
initiating construction of the facility and, .if necessary, fish passage facilities must be
incorporated into the project plans.
3.1.3. Administrative Framework
Since the 1980s, specific agencies at various levels were established under governments to
carry on environmental monitoring and management for development projects, protection and
management of natural resources.  The following chart shows the environmentai
administrative framework pertinent to Ertan Hydroelectric Project.

3.2.1.2.    Regulations for Land Requisition, Compensation,
and Resettlement Applicable to Large and Median
Scale Water Resource and Hydropower
Developments (February, 1991).
The regulations were developed to implemernt portions of the 'Land Administration Law of
the P. R. China" and the "Water Law of tie P. R. Chinae.- They are designed to strengthen
administration of land requisition and resettlement of persons displaced by large and median-
scale hydroelectric and other water resource developments. The aim is to enable equitable
requisition of necessary land and the resettlement of persons occupying the land.
The regulations provide guidelines for correctly handling the relations between the State,
collective groups, and individuals both in the areas from which the people must move and
in the areas to which the displaed persons will be relocated. The regulations mandate the
integation of resettlement of displaced persons with the planilng and construction of the
project. The interests of the displaced persons are given equal consideration with the
exploitation of the resources, water and soil conservation considerations and the overall
economic development to ensure that the affected persons are able to attain a living standard
equal to or higher than in their original conditions. In developing the resettlement plan, first
consideration will be to move the individuals as short a distance as possible. If not possible.
resettlement areas can be developed by reclaiming otherwise unused lands.
The resettlement plan must be developed early in the project planning process. The project
owner should develop the plan on the basis of natural and economic conditions in the
receiving area and in cooperation with local governments. The resettlement plan must be
submitted at the same time the feasibility and preliminarv design documents are reviewed.
For large scale projects, it is the responsibility of the project owner to pay compensation for
acquired lands and to provide subsidies to the displaced persons. The specific criteria for
compensation and subsidy is determined by local provincial or autonomous district
governments.

I.. BASELINE CONDIONS                               -
A.. Physical Geography
1..   Topography
The Yalong River is a major tributary in the upper Chang Jiang (Yangzte) basin (Figure 4.1).
It arises to the south of Bayankela Mountains in Yushu County, Qinghai Province, and is
adjacent to the Dadu River basin in the east and the Jinsha River basin in the south. The
main stream and its tributaries give the appearance of a feather pattern. Most of the west,
north and east of the basin are surrounded by high mountains over 4000 m altitude. The
most famous ones are Mt. Gongga, Mt. Daxue and Mt. Bayankela, all of which exceed 5500
mn. The highest is Mt. Gongga which reaches 7590 m (Figure 4.2). The source of the
Yalong is at about 5400 m and its mouth. 1500 km away, is at 980 m giving a totl elevation
range of 4420 m or about 3 rn/km.
The landscape and climate of the river change along its length. The headwater region is a
high altitude plateau with undulating, low, and grass-covered hills. wide and flat river
vallevs. and a gentle river flow- South of this plateau, to about 28°N latitude, the
topography of the basin is characterized bv high mountains, gorges, and forests. South of
28°N latitude, wide river vallevs with developed agriculture alternate with rather wide gorges
and high mountains. This combination of features characterizes the landscape in the project
area (Figure 4.3).

2..   Climate
The climate of the Yalong River basin is characteistic of the Western Sichuan Plateau Zone
defined by the Sichuan Meteorology Board. Climate is influenced mainly by a west wind
circulation and a southwest monsoon. Dry and wet seasons are clearly divided: the dry
season lasts from December to May, and the wet season from June to November.
The mean dnnual rainfall in the basin ranges from 500 mm in the north and west to 1560 mm
in the south and east. The annual rainfall at the dam site is about 1000 mm. Rainstorms
generally occur between June and September in the south of the catchment where daily tQoals
can reach 200 mm. The mean annual temperature ranges from -4.9°C in the north to 19.7,C
in the south. The annual cvaporation rates range from 1326 mm in the north and west to
2544 mm in the south and east. Relative humidity is generally low, from 57-69 percent
which corresponds with the higher evaporation rates. The maximum wind velocity recorded
at the dam site is 18 misec. A variety of meteorological data are given in Table 4.1.
Various climatic extremes affect the basin. Droughts in the spring and autumn can disturb
agricultural production, as can hail storms between August and September in higher regions
between 1600-2300 m. Rain storms (days with precipitation over 50 mm) occur on about
three days each year (maximum ever recorded 175 mm in one day). These storms can cause
landslides which damage fields. roads, railways and bridges. Economic losses occur every
Year because of the storms. In addition, gales and occasional unseasonable fTosts may cause
agricultural damage.
3..   Geology
The geology of the Yalong watershed is complex, with exposed strata revealing the
underlying granite, gneiss, schist, shale, marble, other limestones. sandstone. shales,
conglomerates, basalt, and other magmatic rocks.
The Ertan dam and power station are located on the western side of the middle section of the

Sichuan-Yunnan North-South Tectonic Belt. the basic structure of which consists of large,
deep fault zones and divided blocks. The Ertan dam site is situated on the Gonghe Fault
Block and is surrounded by five fault zones. The Gonghe Fault Block itself has an area of
some 1700 km2. The cen:ral part of the block is 800 ki2, and tectonic failure is rather
weak. The rock mass is relatively integrated, and the faults are small and run generally
north-south (Figure 4.4). The fractuTe zones are compact and filled by a later rock dike.

Seismic activity in the area amund the dam-site is monitored by eight seismic stions which
feed data continuously into a central computer-assisted monitoring station at the EHDC office
at Tongzilin (Figure 4.4).
4.. Mineral resources
More than 20 different economically important mineals have boen found in the Yalong
watershed including iron, copper, nickel, chromium, titanium, lead, zinc, mercury,
muscovite, coal, and calcaeous spar. Thee are more than 160 mnine sites, though none is
large.
5..   Soils
Because the area in the immediate area of the Ertan Project is mountainous and the valley
wals steep, soils are generally quite thin over the bedrock. Thicker layers of soil are found
in the bottoms of the valleys. Most of the soils in the Yalong watershed are drab red soils,
red soils, and mountain yellow-brown soils. The organic content of most of the soils is
quite low because the topographic relief and geologic movement is not conducive to retaining
organic materials in the soils. Much of the organic material is flushed from the mountain
sides during the wet season. The poor soil types within the project area are also typical of
subtropical regions in general where most of the nutrients are tied up as vegetative biomass.
B.. Biogeography
Tnc delimitation of biogeo_raphic arcas is very dependent on the group of animals or plants
sEudied. According to the Udvardy system, the study area is located in the Sichuan
Highlands, the southemmost portion of the Palearctic Realm which stretches from Europe
to Japan. To the south, the Sichuan Highland abuts the Indo-Malayan Realm which extends
from the south northwards tO the southern portion of Yunnan Province. Under this system,
the Sichuan Highlands represent one of eleven divisions of the Chinese portion of the
Palearctic Realm. Under the Cheng and Zhang system, the project area lies in China's

Southwest Region of the Oriental Realm, outside the Palearctic.
An important point missed by many biogeographic studies is that the division between the
southwest plains and the eastern end of the Himalayas is not strictly a line, but rather a
crescent-shaped zone deserving recognition as a biogeogaphical unit in its own right. As
the Ministry of Forestry's (1993) Biodiversay Action Plan notes, It is here that many of
China's most significanr and distncdve animals live - giant panda, red panda. ral4n, golden
monkey, many species of pheasants, and an enormous richness of planu. '  The
biogeographic divisions (termed biounits) used in ta report are adopted here in discussions
of the project area. The relative locafiens of these units are shown in Figure 4.5. Based on
this definition of biography, the project area lies in the Yiinnan Plateau subunit (39a) of
Southwest Mountains biounit (39).
C.. The Aquatic System
1.    Hydrology
During the initial planning stages for the Ertan Hydroelectric Project, EHDC in consultation
with CHIDI, established several hydrologic, water quality, and climate monitoring stations
throughout the Yalong, Anning, and Jinsha River basins. The locations of these sites are
shown on Figure 4.6.  Data obtained from  these sites are used to summarized the
hydrological, water qualitv and climate regimes of the river basin.
The primanr source of water in the Yalong River is precipitation (both rainfall and snow in
the upper reaches of the basin). The Yalong River originates in Qinghai Province at the
southern boundary of the Bavankela Mountains of the Himalavan Mountains. Elevations in
the upper reaches range from 4,180 m to over 5,000 m above sea level. The river valley
is oriented generally from northwest to southeast with small tributaries entering the river
from both the east and west sides of the main valley. Most of the catchment area of the
Yalong lies to the west of the river.
Based on the 29-year hydrologic record (1953-1982) from the Xiaodeshi Hydrology Station,
the mean annual flow in the river is 1,670 m31s. Because the discharge regime is dependent

Figure 4.7:  Average Monthly Discharge at Waii. Luning and Xiaodeshi Hydrologic Gauging
Stations on Yalong River.
The hydrologic regime of the Yalong is characterized as seasonal, with high discharge
occurring from June through October and low flow conditions extending from November
through May. Average discharge in the high flow season is approximately 3,240 m3is and
in the low flow season discharge averages 450 m3/s, as measured at the Xiaodeshi Hydrology
Station. The differences between the high flow and low flow seasons are demonstrated by
the average monthly discharges presented in Figure 4.7 for the Yalong at Xiaodeshi, Luning
and Wali Hydrologic Gauging Stations. Examples of the year to year variation in discharge
are shown in Figures 4.8, 4.9. and 4.10, representing normal, high and low flow years,
respectively.

and lower reaches of the valley. These events normally occur between June and September
with the largest number occurring in July and August. Generally, flood events a,e of
relativcly long duiadon. At Xaodeshi, peak flood events last from 7 to 9 days. The
observed maximum fRood during the 29-year hydrologic record occurred in August, 1965,

The largest tributary to the Yalong River within the Ertan Reservoir area is the Ganyu River.
The river arises on the west -side of the Yalong catchment and flows to the east where it
flows into the Yalong approximately 19 km upstream from the Ertan Dam site. Flow in the
Ganyu is monitored at the Yanbian Hydrology Staion. The 17-year hydrologic record is
from 1976 to 1993. The annual hydrologic regime is similar to that described for the Yalong

November through May. Average discharge in the Ganyu is approximately 69.8 m3/s.
Average discharge during the high flow period is 140 m3/s and during the low flow period
average discharge is 19.4 m3/s. Average annual flows in the Ganyu River are demonstrated
in Figure 4.11.
Annual flooding in the Ganyu River basin occurs during the wet season with most of the
flood events occurring in July and August, as with the Yalong River. Basedon the available
hydrologic record, the maximum flood of record occurred in September, 1979, and was

approximately 50 percent of the flow in the Jinsha as observed at Jinjiang Railwav Station
located downstream from the confluence of the Yalong and Upper Jinsha Rivers.

Figure 4.12: Relative average monthly discharge of Yalong and Jinsha River downstream from
confluence.
To understand the sediment and bedload regime within the Yalong River, it is first necessary
to describe the types of terrain through which the river flows. Because the mountains of this
area are relatively young, considerable amounts of sediment and bedload materials are
introduced into the river and carried downstream. Above Ganzi. Figure 1.1. the Yalong
River flows through a high plateau area in which the river vallec is wide and flat with gently
undulating topographv. The area is covered by grassland. From Ganzi to Yajiang. the area
is mountainous, although with gentle slopes and well developed soil layers. This is an
agncultural region with fairly extensive grassland. The cultivated areas are relativelv flat
but disconnected. Approximately 18 km downstream from Yajiang, the Xianshui River flows
into the Yilong. This area is subject to frequent earthquak-es and is characterized by
fractured rocks and collapsed mud and rockl flows. Between the Xianshui River and the Wali
Gauging Station, the Yalong flows through an area of high mountains with deep gorges and
steep slopes. The area above Wali is forested mountains and valleys.

Downstream from Wali, the valley walls nse 700 to 1,500 m above the river. The area is
subjected to frequent storm events. The rock on both sides of the valley are weathered and
fractured and are subject to extensive erosion during storm events. This portion of the valley
is the primary source of the sediment and bedload materials carried by the Yalong River.
Based on masureaments of sediment and bedload transport made at the Wali Gauging Station,
the estimated annual sediment yield from the upper pordon of the Yalong Catchment is 144
tons/lkm2 and the average sediment content in the river is 0.38 kg/m3. At the upper end of
the Ertan Reservoir, the estimated annual sediment yield is 233 tons/lkm and the estimated
average sediment eontent is 0.435 kg/m3. At the Xiaodeshi Gauging Station, the estimated
annual yield of sediment and bedload is 169 tonslkm2 (less than at the upper end of the
reservoir) and the annual averge sediment content is 0.61 kg/m 3 (greater than at the upper
end of the reservoir).
The suspended sediment and bedload discharge in the Yalong River is not uniform through
the year, as is expected in such rivers with extended high flow and low flow seasons.
During the high flow season, suspended sedimentand bedload discharge normally contributes
to over 90 percent of the total annual yield. During the high flow season (June through
September), the average discharge at Xiaodeshi is approximately 3,240 m3/s. Average
sediment content is 0.61 kg/rn3. The extreme differences in suspended sediment discharge
between high and low flow seasons is exemplified from the observations made in 1981. The
total annual sediment discharge estimated at Xiaodeshi was 36.3 million tons of which 35.7
million tons, or 98.3 percent, passed Xiaodeshi during the high flow season.
Although the total estimated sediment load for the Yalong River at Xiaodeshi includes the
contribution of tributaries, the expected configuration of the Ertan Reservoir merits
discussion of sediment and bedload characteristics of the Ganyu River of which 40 km of the
lower portion of the river will be inundated by the reservoir. As discussed above and
elsewhere, the inundated portion of the Ganyu River is sufficiently distinct from the main
body of the reservoir that the Ganyu Ann of the reservoir, in many ways, will act as a
separate reservoir. According to data obtained at the Yanbian Gauging Station, average flow
in the Ganyu River is 69.8 m3/s. The annual average sediment content is 0.76 kg/m3.
E"M EAs4 O4.19



Based on these data, it is assumed that the average annual bedload contnbuted to the upper
end of the Ertan Reservoir will be approximately 579,400 tons and the annual bedload
contributed to the Ganyu Arm will be 90,600 tons.
3.    Water Quality
a..   Factors Affecting Vater Quality
(1). Geology and Mineral Resources.
The geologic structure of the Yalong Catchment is complicated. The exposed rock strata are
comprised of granite, gneiss. schist. slate, marble, limestone, sandstone, shale,
conglomerate, magmatic and super basalt, and neutral and alkaline magmatic rocks.
Differential weathering of this complex array of geologic materials contributes greatly to the
quality of the water in the Yalong River. Water quality in the reaches of the Yalong River
in Qinghai Province is categorized as Class 1I with respect to water quality (see Section
3.1.2.3). Within Sichuan Province, the Yalong River is categorized as Class III with respect
to water quality.
(2).  Pertinent  Topographv,  Climate,  and   Soil
Characteristics.
Summanzing the topography presented above. the Yalong River system arises on the
southern slopes of Bavankela Mountain. The upper reaches of the Yalong flow throueh an
area of high plateau with low hills and wide valleys. Although snow melt contributes to flow
in the Yalong. most of the flow arises from rain runoff. There is some groundwater
contribution, but this is a minor source of water to the river. The middle reach of the
Yalong Valley is characterized by high mountains and deep gorges. This mountainous terrain
is also present in the lower portions of the valley. The steepness of the Yalong Valley allows
precipitation runoff to leave the valley quickly. Consequently, water does not remain in the
upper portions of the catchment for a sufficient length of time that disolution or biological
processes to affect water quality.

ERVAN BA c.~~~~~            4.20



Climate in the Yalong Valley is generally considered to be wet, subtropical. Mean annual
precipitation ranges from about 500 mm per year in the upper portion of the basin to over
1,500 mm per year at the mouth of the Yalong at the Jinfsa River. Seasonal differences in
precipitation coupled with the extreme topographic relief results in extreme seasonal
differeices in cetain water quality parameters (eg. turbidity and sediment load).
The soils in the basin are generally drab red soil, red soil, and mountain yellow brown soil.
Soils on the mountain slopes are generaly thin although most is covered with vegetation
which reduces erosion potential. Soils in the upper plateau area and in agricultural areas
with gentle slopes are somewhat deeper. Again these soils are either covered with grassland
or savannah-like vegetation, or are terraced into tillable fields. The vegetative cover and the
agricultural practices all reduce the potential for excessive erosion. The lack of nutrients in
the soils and their generally shallow depths minimizes the contribution of nutrients and
organic compounds to water draining from the more gentle slopes into the Yalong River or
its tributaries.
(3).  Discharge from Domestic and Industrial Pollution
Sources.
Because the area above the Ertan Project Site is very sparselv populated, sources of domestic
and industrial pollution are limited and their total contribution to the quality of water in the
Yalong in the vicinity of the Ertan Project is not detectable.
Approximately 21.400 individuals reside in the urban center of Yanbian and Yanvuan
Counties. Using the national average production of wastewater per person. the daily
production of domestic waste%ater from these urban areas is approximatelv 2.100 tons (0.1
ton/person/day).
The main industrial sources of pollution include the Yanbian Paper Mill (with a waste water
discharge of approximatelv 300 tons per day), a slaughterhouse, brewery, and cement plants.
Wastes discharged from these industrial sources consist primarily of alkali and biochemical
oxygen demanding materials (measured as BOD). Approximately 500 tons of wastes are
34112
EqTA EA Ca                           4.21



discharged daily from the Eran Clay Mine. These wastes consist almost exclusively of
suspended solids. In addition, many of these industrial areas utilize watr from the Yalong
as well as other tributaries to the Yalong. A summary of the water consumption, water
discharge, and the major pollutants from several of these sites is presented in Table 4.3.
In Yanbian County, approximately 50 tons of various organochloride pesticides are used
annually in agriculturc. If 11 of these pesticides enter the river (disregarding any degradation
or retention in the soil), the concentration of organic pesticides in the river would be less
than 0.001 mg/l. This concentration is less than the national standard for drinking water.
In general, discharge of wastewater from various sources in the Yalong River is much less

b..   Characterization of Water Quality
(1)   Water Temperature
Water tempeature data for the Yalong River are available for the period 1959 through 1992
for the Xlaodeshi Gauging Stadon, located dowastream from the Ertan Project site tSee
Figure 4.6). Average monthly water temperes at Xaodeshi for the 'penod of record are
depicted in Figure 4.13. As shown in the figure, water temperatures at Xiaodeshi vary
seasonally from appromimately 8°C during Demnber and January to approximatdy 190C
from June through August Aveage monthly water temperature data from the upper end of -
the impoundment zone at the Wali and Luning Gauging Stations are also presented .in Figure
4.13 to demonstrate the increase in temperature from Wali to Xiaodeshi, through the
impoundment zone.
Water temperature data for the Ganyu River are available for the period 1978-1982 from the
Yanbian Gauging Station. Mean, maximum and minimum temperatures by month for the
period of record are depicted in Figure 4.14. The geneal pattern of variation in seasonal
temperature is similar to that observed in the Yalong. The primary difference is that the
overall temperature of the Ganyu is somewhat higher than that in the Yalong. Minimum
temperatures in December and January range between 10 and 12°C and the annual highs,
occurring in May through July, generally range from 20 to 22°C
(2). Water Chemistry
Water-samples from the Yalong River were obtained on three occasions each year from 1973
- 1979. and 19B1 at the Xiaodeshi Gauging Station (See Figure 4.4), representing the high
flow season, the low tlow season, and the transition between the low flow and high flow
seasons. The samples were analyzed for 20 parameters. Summaries of the results of these
analyses are presented in Table 4.4. (Data from the three samples are pooled in the table).
In 1989 and 1990, water quality samples were collected at Xiaodeshi each month. These
data awe summarized in Table 4.5.

Figure 4.13: Monthly average water temperature of Yalong River at Xiaodeshi Gaging Station
(1959 - 1992)
Based on the data presented in Tables 4.4 and 4.5. the quality of the Yalong River is
characterized as calcium bicarbonate Type I with total alkalinity generally greater than total
hardness. This is reflected in the slightly alkaline pH values which generally range between
7.6 and 9.1. Dissolved oxygen concentrations are generally below saturation with annual
measurements frequently lower than 6 mg/l.  However, in 1989 and 1990. the DO
concentrations remained at or above 6 mgll throughout the vear. The dissolved minerals are
characteristic of water that arises from  igneous/metmorphic rock and suggests that
groundwater influence is fairly great in the upper portions of the basin.  Nutrient
concentrations are relatively low reflecting the lack of organic materials (organic soils) in the
river basin.
Water quality samples were collected from the Yalong River basin in 1980, 1981, 1989 and
1990 at several locations through the valley (See Figure 4.6). Again three samples werc

collected each year at each location. Results of the analyses are summarized in Table 4.6.
Data collected during the high and low flow periods are presented separately in the table.
Arranged from the upper end of the valley to the mouth, the temperature data indicate the
warming of the river during both the high and low flow seasons. Several of the water quality
parameters indicate conspicuous changes in conccntrations between the Clay Mine and the
Yanbian bridge sampling site. This is exemplified bv the turbidity of the Yalong which is
between 5 and 7 turbidity units at the upstream sites and increases to 15 to 20 turbidity units
at the two bridge sites. During high flow, turbidity remains fairly constant through the
reach. For dissolved oxvgen, the percent saturation remains above 95 percent during both
the high and low flow seasons in the upper portion of the basin. However, at the two
downstream sites, the percent saturation appears to be somewhat lower and is below 90
percent saturation at times.

confluence of the Yalong River are presented in Table 4.7. Samples were obmained during
dry, median and wet seasons at four locaions on the Jinsha (Long Dnng, Panzhihua
Hydrographic Station, Luo Gou, and Jinjiang Railway Station. Additional samples wyere
obtained at the mouth of the Anning River and atrae mouth of the Yalong River (see Figure
4.6). The data indicate that water in the Jinsha River, except for intestinal bacteria and
copper, indicate high quality water at all of the Jinsha River Stations. The primary pollutant,
that detracts from the quality of water in the Jinsha is the exceedingly high intesdnal bacteria
concentrations at all stations with the exception of the Long Dong Station.
In general, the quality of the water in the Jinsha, upstream from Panzhihua City is quite good
corresponding to a Class III river. After passing through Panzhihua City concentrations of
cadmium, lead, BOD, COD, and total nitrogen increase significantly along with the dramatic
increase in intestinal bacteria concentrations. These increases are attributable to sewage
discharge from Panzhihua City. An estimated 57.2 million tons of untreated sewage
discharged to the Jinsha River annually. Water quality recovers somewhat downstream prior
to the inflow from the Yalong. However, the general quality of the water in the Jinsha is
within Class III in comparison with the Water Quality Standards of the Environmental
Protection Law.
4..   Aquatic Vegetation
Rooted aquatic vegetation in the Yalong River is sparsely distributed. Small pockets of
rooted aquatics are present throughout the system but hvdrologic, hydraulic and suspended
sediment conditions prevent extensive areas of these plants both in the Yalong and in the
Ganyu River. A reconnaissance of the Yalong and Ganyu River reaches to be inundated by
the Ertan Reservoir revealed five species of rooted aquatic plants consisting of Potamogeton
francluns. Potamogeron crispis, Ulieudria aurea, Charafagilis, and Hvdrilla quadrifolia.
Floating aquatic vegetation such as Eichhomia crassipes, has been observed in the reservoir

area, but not in the Ganyu or Yalong Rivers. Farmers in the vicinity of Yanbian County use
small irrigation reservoirs to culture Eichornia as a source of fodder for pigs. Other
floating species such as Pistia stradiores and Salvinia were not observed in either the Yalong
or Ganyu River Valleys.
Phytoplankton have been surveyed and, as would be expected, populations are denser in the
relativery sluggish Ganyu Arm than in the Yalong Mainstem.
S..   Fish and Other Aquatic Organisms
a..   FLsh
The Yalong River is a major tributary of the Jinsha River (Yangtze River) which is the
largest river of China and one of the largest river systems in the world (Figure 4.1). As
large as the Jinsha River system is, the fish fauna is relatively unk-.-uw.. The most intensive
fishery surveys in the project area were conducted in 1983 and 1984 by the Sichuan Aquaaic
Product Research Institute in association with CHIDI to support the environmental assessment
for the first stage loan. Additional surveys were conducted in 1990 and 1991 by the
Biological Department of Shichuan Teacher's College and CHIDI. In 1992 and 1993.
CHIDI. the Sichuan Teacher's College and the Sichuan Environmental Science Research
Institute conducted a fish survev to support the Tongzilin Environmental Assessment. Other
survevs have been conducted bv a number of other institutes for various purposes. The most
recent compilation of species known or expected to occur in the Yalong and Jinsha Rivers
in Sichuan Province is presented in Annex 2.1. The list includes 151 species of fish in the
Jinsha River. and 100 species occur in the Yalong of which all but three are found in the
Jinsha as well.
Generally, fish species occurring in the Yalong and Jinsha rivers can be characterized into
three major groups: Type A fish include those species which are generally found in the
plains area in which the rivers are characteristically low gradient and velocities are slow.

Type B fish occur in rivers at middle elevations where the gradients are somewhat higher and
water velocities are swifter. Type C fish are found in high elevation rivers characterized as
high gradient, cold, and highly oxygenated. Examples of the distributions of fish. in each of
these habitat types is presented in Figure 4.15. The general type (A, B or C) of habitat
utilized by each of the fish species in the Yalong Basin is also presented in Annex 2.1. As
indicated in the list, the majoritv of the species occurring in the Ertan Reach of the Yalong
belong to the second category (Type B).
Because a primary source of the Yalong River is snowmelt of the Bayankela Mountains and
other mountain ranges surrounding the upper Yalong Basin, water temperature is relatively
low. Upstream from Jinping Mountains, the fish fauna is generally characteristic of the
Qinghai-Tibet associations comprised of relatively few species. The primarv genera in this
area include Schizothorax. Nemacheilus, and Sisoridae spp.
Below elevation 2,000 m, the climate is generally dry and warm. Consequently, water
temperature in tributaries to the Yalong and in the Yalong itself awe somewhat hiat.er. More
species occur in this type of condition as indicated in Anncx 2. 1. Although there are more
species represented in this reach, the populations of each species tend to be somewhat
smaller.
The difference in the numbers of species of fish residing at various elevations is supported
by results of several surveys conducted by CHIDI. Sichuan Teacher's College and the
Sichuan Environmental Science Research Institute. Some fifty species were identified frem
the lower reach of the Yalong River and near its confluence with the Jinsha River. Within
the reservoir area 37 species were documented from the river. In studies Lo suppor, the
Jinping I.and Jinping 1I projects. upstream from Ertan, 28 species were identified.
Surveys of fish made at four stations around the reservoir area to support the Ertan Projec!
revealed great differences in the species present and their relative abundances. Schizorhorax
species (average weights of 200-500 g) were among the most conspicuous in numbers and
total biomass. Common carp, Cyprinus carpio, (average weight 500-2500 g) formed a
EV.^N EA Co"                          4.37



conspicuous propordon of the catch at three of the stations, but the large catfish, Silurus
merid&onalis (average weight 4.5 - 6 kg) dominated the catch in terms of biomass at two
stations although few indiwduals were caught. The inconsistency between the results
indicates that the complexities of the total aquatic environment are little understood.
During a reconnaissance of the reservoir area conducted between May 26 and June 1, 1994,
incidental observations of local fishermen in the Puwei River (tributary to the Yalong on east
side of vallev approximately 10 km upstream from mouth of Ganyu) indicated up to 17
species occurring at the mouth of the Puwei River. Preliminary identification of the fish
indicated the occurrence of Schizothorax spp., several other Cyprinidac spp., Bagridae spp,
and Sisoridae spp. Species of the fish were not identified in the field. The diversity of fish
collected is depicted in Figure 4.16.
Of concern relative to the construction of the Ertan Dam is the occurrence of migratory fish
species that periodically use the Yalong River for spawning, rearing or foraging. Based on
current understanding of thc habits Qf fish known to occur in the Yalong, the only migratory
species that might occur in the river is-the eel, Anguillajaponica. This catadromous species
is economically important. Although Ding, et al. (1994) indicates that it occurs in the
Yalong, recent surveys of the fish fauna in the Yalong have not reported its presence. The
potential for this species occurring in the Yalong is quite high. The only possible barrier to
its movement into the Yalong River is the Gezhouba Dam located in Hubei Province
downstream from the Three Gorges reach of the Chang Jiang (Yangtze) River. Based on
familiarity with the ability of the eel to pass through such barriers. the frequencv with
Gezhouba spills and the presence of navigation locks in the dam would not inhibit upstream
or downstream passage of the eel. Therefore, it is likely that Anguilla is present in the
Yalonv River fr. h .Lher sampling of the fish fauna in the Yalong is needed to confirm its
presence or absence.
As noted above, three species identified bv Ding (1994) appear to occur in the Yalong but
not in the Jinsha. The three species are: Gymnocypris patanini. Triplophvsa markehenensis,
and T. angeli. These species have also been identified from the Upper Jinsha. mid and upper

Dadu, Mingjiang and Anning Rivers. Further investigation regarding the distribution and
abundance of these species is warranted.
Two species of fish, identified as occurring in the Jinsha River in Sichuan Province and
identified in the IUCN list of endangered species of the world are the two sturgeon species,
Acipenser sinensis and A. dabryanus.  A. sinensis. the giant Chinese sturgeon, is
anadromous. It grows to nearly 500 Lkg (over 3.0 m in length) in the ocean and would return
to spawn in the lower Jinsha in the vicinity of Yibin in Sichuan Province, approximatelv
3,000 km from the ocean. Construction of the Gezhouba Dam has effectively block}ed the
migration of the sturgeon. Efforts to artificially spawn the species and return juveniles to
the river downstream from Gczhouba are reportedly relatively successful (Yu, CHIDI, pers.
comm; Bi, Ministry of Forestry, pers. comm.). The artificial spawning program includes
collection of gravid adults, artificial extrusion and fertilization of the eggs, incubation of the
eggs, and rearing the fry to a free-swimming stage in a series of ponds. Juvenile sturgeon

are released to the Chang Jiang (Yangcze) downstream from Gezlhouba Dam.
The habits of A. dabryanus are not known. This species is much smaUler than A. sinensis,
reaching an adult length of only 90 cm. It is likely that the species follows a life history
similar to that described for A. sinensis but the locations of the spawning areas have not been
identified. It is not known if an artificial reproduction program for this species hat been
implemented.
b..   Plankton and benthos
Zooplankton have been surveyed and, as would be expected. populations are denser in the
relativelv sluggish Ganyu arm than in the Yalong mainstem. The benthos is dominated by
the larvae of caddisflies (Trichoptera), with larvae of mayflies (Ephemeroptera) and other
insects being rare. Snails appeared to be restricted to the rice fields.
D.. Terrestrial Vegetation. Wildlife and Biodiversity
L..   Vegetation
The Enan Reser-oir area of the Yainn2 River is in a transition zone t.etween the more
widely d;stributed trcpic and subtropic zones of southern China. The climate alternates
be:n.en .ot int! zvol and drv and humid. This varied climatic condition is reflected in the
:11s. which ntergrades between subtropical and tropical vegetation types.
Nat:e veanion artind the Ertan reservoir is characteristic of the subtropical biome with
some tropical elements present. T he species composition reflects the moderate climate, lack
of four seasons, and relatively constnt temperature throug,h the year. Most of the area that
will be inundated has been disturbed bv human activities. Only about 1,000 ha of relatively
undisturbed stands of native vegetation remain within the 10.100 ha reservoir area. The
Chinese subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests that once dominated the area are

charact   by some 14,500 species of flowering plants, with many of these speces are
known only from China. The forests were dominated by oaks (Fagacae: Custanopsis.
Lithocarpus and up to a dozen other genera), and laurels (Lauraceae). Among the endemic
species of trees of this area are Schottky's oak Cyclbanoides glaucoides, Delavay's oak
Csaunopsir delayi, Smith's fir Abies georgei, Evelyn's bezeleeria A. evelyniana, and the
Yunnan pine P snyusyw esais. This later species is a pioneer species typical of open forest
gaps, landslips and similar sites in the lower montane zone. The forest trees of the main
canopy would typically reach 20 m in height, with layers of smaller trees and shrubs beneath
them. A very small percentage of the original cover of this forest type remains in China.
The distribution of remnant areas of subtropical broatleaf evergreen forest and other
vegetation types in the vicinity of the Yalong River in southwest Sichuan is shown in Figures
4.17 and 4.18.
The primary vegetation on the steep slopes immediately above the Yalong River have the
appearance of a savannah scattred, open canopy trees with grasses and forbs prevalent
between the trees, as shown in Figure 4.19. This savanna-like appearance of the lower
elevation forests (from the river level to approximately 1200 m) is probably the result of
harvesting of the mature timber with the only partal rgeneration of some trees. The open
canopy is probably now minXtained by livestock grazing, as evidenced by numerous trails
observed on the steep slopes, coupled with the steepness of the slopes and the associated
shallow soils.
As is typical in mountainous regions with extreme topographic relief, the distribution of
vegetative types is highlv correlated with elevation in the Yalong Vallev. This elevational
zonation in the Yalong valley is depicted schematically in Figure 4.20. Within the area of
the Ertan Reservoir, the vegetative cover is dominated by various grasses and forbs with
small shrubs and trees scattered on the steep slopes of the valley (See Figure 4. I9). The
grass-shrub-scattered tree type vegetation dominates the valley floor and slopes with
elevations less than 1,100 to 1,200 mn. Semi-humid evergreen broadleaf forest, characteristic
of the subtropical climate, occurs at mid elevations in the vicinity of the Ertan Reservoir
(between elevations 1,100 and 1,600 on north facing slopes and between eevations 1,200 and

,AN ER CM                            4.43 0



1,700 m on south facing slopes). Because the aea is also influenced by the southwest
monsoons, pine forests (dominated by P. yunnanensis) occur at higher elevations (above
1,600 m on the north fcing slopes anid above 1.700 m on south facing slopes).
More than 300 species of higher plants are known from the inundation zone, most of which
are widespread species of disturbed communides (below 1,200 m elevation). Typical trees
in these areas are the kapok reladve Gossanpinus malabaricu, the timber tree Toona fureni,

Engelhardia spica a, Phyllawhus emblica, and Jarropha curcas. The grasses are comprised
of Imperata cylindrica. Heteropogon conlonus, 7hemeda triondra. and Cymbopogon distons.
Of the 10,100 ha area to be inundated by the Ertan Reservoir, approximately 2,400 ha are
covered by this type of vegetation. Above 1,200 m the remnant broadleaf forests are
dominated by Quercus franceii. mixed with Engelhardia colebrookiana. Diospyros
mollifolia, Cyclobalanopsis delavayi and others. Because the distribution of this type of forest
is limited below 1,200 m, only scattered tracts, ranging in size from 10 to 100 ha occur
within the area to be inundated by the reservoir. The total amount of land covered bv these
remnant areas within the reservoir area is approximatelv 1.050 ha. Above 1.700 m the
oakllaurel vegetation is mixed with rhododendrons Rhdodendrnn. winterareen Gautiheria.
and bilberries Vaccciniunm. These species intergrade with the Yunnan pine (P. vannianertsis)
forests above Elevation 1600 m (See Figure 4.20).
2.    Fauna
Recent information pertaining to the fauna of the Yalong River basin is not readily available.
Description of the vertebrate communities is based on records of collections made in the
*t 12
TMl EmACHO                           4.45



1930s and 1940s. Consequendy the curent condition of the vertebrate communities, even for
the birds, is poorly understood. Human intervention in the area, consisting of timber
harvest, agriculture and grazing practices has changed the community structure considerably.
The following descriptions are based on the best available information.
a..  . Amphibiaps
Over 20 species of amnphibians have been recorded from the reservoir area and its
surroundings (Annex 2.2). Four of these, Batrachuperus yenguanensis, Megophrys
shapingensi, Scudger auberculanrs and Amolops loloensis, are endemic to Sichuan and are
known to occur in the vicinity of the -project reservoir. None of these endemic amphibian
species is considered treatened or endangered.
Two species of Batrachuperus and Bufo andrewsi are used by local residents for medicinal
purposes, and the larger frogs are eaten. Their economic importance also stems from their
habit of eating insects that are deleterious to agriculture.
b..   Reptiles
Two turtle, eight lizard, and 18 snake species are known from the reservoir area and its
surroundings (Annex 2.3). None of the reptilian species is considered threatened at a globai
level. The turtles and larger snakes have medicinal and food value and consequently the
populations are relatively sparse. The cobra Naja naja and the three vipers are dangerous
to humans. Local residents recognize that some snakes and lizards feed on agricultural pests
and. therefore. are considered beneficial.
c..   Birds
Birds in and around the project are generally rare, as they are in much of lowland China.
This general cendition is due to efforts in the 1950s by the national and provincial
U1412
ERTN IA a" E4.46,,



governments to control insect that caused considerable damage to agricultural crops. In lieu
of the effects of widespread use of pesticides. a total of 229 species of birds are recorded
from the area surunding the Ertan Reservoir (Annex 2.4). Five species are considered
endangered by the global community and, of these, four occur in the subtropical broadleaf
forest (see discussion of Biological Diversity, Section 4.4.3). The fifth species, the
black-necked crane, winters in cultivated areas of the Yalong Valley and is classified as
Vulnerable by IUCN. In China, the black-necked cane is designated as a first-grade species
(endangered) under-the Cninese Endangered Speces Act (See Chapter 3). Temminck's
tragopan, Tmagopn renmbnafic, is also protected as a second-grade species (threatened) under
the Chinese Endangered Species Act.
The bird species occurring in the vicinity of the Ertan Project can be categorized into one
of four groups based on their distribution:
1.    Birds of the river valleys with the tree sparrow, Passer monawnus, being the dominant
resident species. Other species include wading birds, water fowl and other migratory
species that move into the area during different seasons.
2.    Birds of agricultural areas including tree sparrow, tawny-flanked prinia (Prinia
subflava), white wagtail (Motacilla alba), and Japanese white-eye (Zosrerops
japonica).
3.    Birds of the disturbed broaaleaf forest, represented by the crested finch-billed bulbul
(Spizixos canifrons), the white-collared babbler (Yuhiina diademara), and the
black-headed sibia babbler (Heterophasia melanoleuca).
4.    Birds of the conifer forest, represented by the red-tailed siva babbler (Minla
ignouinra).
The common pheasant (Phasianus coichicus), Chinese francolin (Francolinus pintadeanus),
ruddy shelduck ('. iorna ferruginea), teal (Anas creca), spot-billed duck (Anas
U & AC4                          4.47



poecilorhyncha). herons, pigeons, woodcock, and various other wading birds are considered
game species and are hunted for their meat and feathers. Certain species are also hunted
because of their medicina; properties [herons for their livers, ducks for their feathers, black
kite (Milvus migrans) for their brains and claws, and various pheasants, hoopoo,
woodpeckers, common myna, crows, thrushes and others.for their whole bodies].
d..   Mammals
The mammals potentiallv present in and around the project area and adjacent upper catchment
are listed in Annex 2.5, together with those known to occur at elevations above the level of
the planned reservoir, and those known to occur between the dam Site and the confluence of
the Yalong with the Jinsha river. Although many mammal species in China are considered
threatened or endangered both by the Chinese government and by the international
community, none is known to occur in the vicinity of the Erman Project either because it is
not suitable for those species or because it was eliminated from the valley many decades
previouslv. The historical range of the tiger Panthera tigris. leopard P. pardus, and possibly
Javan rhino Rhinoceros sondicus includes the Yalong catchment. However. these species
were eradicated from the adjacent catchment of the reservoir many decades ago and
consequently are no longer considered residents and are not included in the list presented in
Annex 2.5.
The most well-known mammal of western and southwestern China. the giant panda. is not
known to inhabit the Yalong Basin. The closest survivins populations are some 200 km
awav (Ficure 4.2I.
Several mammal species occurring in the vicinitv of the Ertan Project are considered
.;ur-beare.s and are consequently hunted by local residents. These species include the bears.
foxes. martens, hares, and squirrels. Other mammalian species are hunted for their
medicinal properties. Musk deer. deer, pangolin. several primates, and river otters fall into
this group of mammals.
Insectivorous species, such as bats, and certain carnivores are considered beneficial because

they feed on insects, rats and mice that are considered pests on agricultural rop. Other
species are considered pests (rats and mice) and some are important in public health
programs because they either carry various human diseases or they are host to invertebrate
vectors of human diseases.
3..   Biological Diversity and Cooservation
The maintenance of ecological biodiversity has become a major concem among conservation
organizations, caional governments and international funding agencies around the world.
This concern focuses on the maintenance and preservation of natural biological communities
and has grown out of the realization that human interfence in natural communities is
leading many species to the brink of extinction. The primary goal for maintaining biological
diversity throughout the world is to reduce the further destruction of natural communities and
to preserve the habitat for species near extinction. The concern for maintaining species
diversity in China is reflected in China's recently developed Biodiversity Action Plan.
Within this plan, the people of China have recognized that many ecosystems, unique to
China, are of value and should be maintained. Consequently, the biodiversity of the area tO
be affected by the Erran Hydroelectric Project has become a concern of both the
environmental community within China and international environmental organizations
monitoring development in developing nations.
The Ertan Project lies within the BioUnit 39(a) described in China's Biodiversity Action
Plan. This BioUnit. delineated as the Southwest Mountains Biounit. is described as 'ver
imporranz' because the richness of plant. bird and mammal species present. and it ranks
second or third in all China in terms of its diversity. To do a detailed. fine-grained
assessment of biological diversity for the Eran Project is not possible, however, due to the
limited amount of information available for the BioUnit. In general, the biodiversty within
the inundation zone is relatively low. The majority of the area is highly disturbed by historic
and cunent human activity: Nearly half of the inundation area is occupied by agricultural
activities (farming and herding), human settlement, replanted forest, timber harvest areas
(including maintained fuelwood forests), grassland hillside, or aquatic habitats (rivers,
MrM FA CPM                           4.50



irrigation ponds, fish ponds, etc). Much of this intenrention occurred many years to several
decades ago and much of the area is only lightly used with some regeneation of typical
vegetation types apparent.
Even with the extent of human activity there are a few remnant areas of native vegetation
that have survived human intrvention. As described previously (Section 4.4.1), scattered
subtropical broadeaf evergmere forest remnants occur throughout the reservoir-arcaL Because
these forests are genrally found between elevations 1,100 m and 1,700 m, the total amount
of this type of forest within the inundation zone is relatively small and scattred. Tracts
ranging in size from 10 to 200 ha account for approximately 1,000 ha or 10 percent of the
total area to be inundated by the reservoir. This type of forest is somewhat more prevalent
at elevations above 1,200 m. The occurrence of this the broadleaf forest at elevations above
the inundation zone will be of importance in the overall environmental management plan
proposed for the Ertan Project. Although the subtropical broadleaf forest does occur within
the valley of the Yalong River, specific knowledge permining to the health of that biotype
is not available at this time.
Aside from the occurrence and distribution of the various forest types within the inundation
zone, little specific information is available to perform a fine-grained biodiversity assessment
of the Ertan Project. As described previously, the occurrence of vertebrate species within
the Yalong River basin has not been updated for many years. However, the potential
biodiversity in the area, based on international standards, can be best described with respect
to the bird community. The irnmortance of the diversitv of particular ecological communities
is generally indicated by the number of species which are endemic not only to the habitat
types but also to the particular area. Among the various vertebrate groups, the bird
community of southwestern Sichuan is best known and their levels of endemism are generally
indicative of endemism in other taxonomic groups.
An assessment of the world's most important areas for conservation has recently been
completed bv Bird Life International (formerly the ICBP). The basis of defining imporant
areas for targeting conservation efforts was the delineation of 'endemic bird areas (EBA).
12t4
UrrA EA CH                           4.S5I



An EBA is defined by the presence of two or more bird species that have restricted ranges
(less than 50,000 km2) and their entire distribution is within the area. Given this definition,
it was determined that twelve EBAs are found in China. One of these.EBAs is the 'South
Chinese Forests' which covers lowland areas up to about 2000 m. Another is the 'Centrl
Sichuan Forests' occurs at elevations above 2000 m in the montane zone. Pordons of the
Yalong River basin (including the vicinity of the Ertan Reservoir) occur in-both of these
EBAs. Because the Central Sichuan Forest occurs at elevations well above the reservoir
area, it is not of concern with respect to the Ertan Project However, the South Chinese
Forest EBA designation is relvant to the Ertan Project. A total of five restricted-range bird
species occur in the South Chinese Forest EBA (Table 4.8). The species axe further
restricted to the broadleaf forests that occur within the 10,000 khn' area comprising the EBA.
With the exception of the laughing-thrush, all are considered to be endangered (Bird Life
International). Although the area covered by this EBA is about 10,000 kn2, considerably
less than this is suitable habitat for these species and less than 5 percent is in currently in
gazetted conservation areas. Consequently, the Ertan Reservoir becomes important in the
overall assessment of the project and provides an opportunity for preserving habitat for these
endangered bird species.

Neither of these preserves target the preservation of the lowland broadleaf evergreen forest
cited within the South Chinese Forest EBA, nor do they contain the broadleaf forest types
like those found in the project area. Luoji Shan is situated at elevations much higher than
those in which the broadleaf forest is found and the Panzhihua Suteilin Preserve focuses
entirely on the preservation of the cvcad population. Consequently, neither preserve provides
for the colnservation of the broadleaf evergreen forest which is the habitat utilized bv the five
bNrd species cited in Table 4.8.
Be.ause the occurrence ot any of the five endemic bird species in the evergreen broadleaf
torcsts surroundinA the Ertan Project is not klnoun, the opportunity for preserving some of
the native forests is an important component as part of the Ertan Hydro mitigation plan.
Specific measures to advance this opportunity are described in the impact assessment and
mitigation section of this EA (Section 5).

E..  Socioeconomic Environment
1..   Water Use
Although the Yalong River and the Ertan Project are located in a relatively uninhabited
portion of southwest Sichuan Province, there are some existing uses of the river that may be
affected- by project structures and operation. The potential effects to these uses may be
attributable to changes in the hydrologic regime, water quality, or sediment load in the river.
Because changes to the hydrologic and water quality regimes may be realzed downstrm
from the confluence of the Yalong with the Jinsha River, a survey of existing water uses was
conducted between the upper end of the Ertan Reservoir and Yibin. Existing uses of the
river and river channel are described below.
a..   Structures Present in the River Channel or Along the
Shoreline
Structures located in and along the Yalong River within the impoundment zone were
inventoried during the planning for resettlement activities and are discussed in the
resettlement sections of the EA- These structures and uses are not addressed here.
Structures in the Yalong River downstream from the Erian dam site include: timber handling
facilities located at Mishaituo, Xiaodeshi; Anninc River mouth, Dapingdi, Niupingzi. and
Sanduizi; an industrial water supply pumping station for the Panzhihua Mine Power Plani
near the confluence of the Yalong with the Jinsha; and the piers of three bridges across the
Yalong River between the dam site and the Jinsha River confluence.
Structures located on the banks of the Yalong River which may be impacted by project
operation include the shoreline facilities associated with the timber handling sites identified
above; residential buildings at Xiaodeshi and Tongzilin; and ancillary buildings associated
with the Panzhihua Mine Power Plant.

b.    Downstream Industrial, Agricultural, and Doiiestic Water
Supply
Use of the Yalong River downstrm  fmm the Ertan Project for industrial, agricultural and
domestic water supply is limited. Currently, water is drawn from the Yalong River at the
Panzhihua Mine Power Plant and at several locadons on the Jnsha between the Yalong
confluence and the Jfnjiang Railway Station. During construction, water is withdrawn from
the Yalong for use at the construction labor camps, at the concrete batch plants, and at the
contractr/administration units established to house the construction managers. Once the
project is completed, the Yalong River wiMl serve as the primary source of water for the
Yanbian County town to be constructed on the right side of the Yalong River downstream
from the confluence of tihe Anning River.
The Panzhihua Mine Water Treatment Plant has a design purification capacity of
approximately i5,000 tons of water per day (about 0. 17 m.3/s). Water treated at this plant
is used primarily by 60,000 to 65.O00 residents in the Panzhihua City area to meet domestic
requirements. Very little of the water is used for industrial purposes. The pumping station
for the water treatment plant is located on the Yalong upstream  from its confluence with the
Jinsha River and is operated on a 24-hour basis. The pumping station houses four pumps
each with a lifting capacity of 280 mn;Ih and a total capacitv of 27,000 m3;day. Currently,
onlv two pumps are used on a 2 4-hour basis with the remaining two operated as-needed or
as reserve pumping capacitv.
Several small pumping stations are located alonc the Jinsha River between the confluence of
the Yalon, River and the Jinjiang Railway Station. These pumping stations are mounted on
floating boats or on tracks that can be moved up and down with the water level. The amoun;
of water withdrawn at these sites is quite small.
C..   Trnnsportation of TLimber
A primarv existing use of the Yalong River is for transporting harvested timber - mainly
9J112
MAN CA CM                            4.56



from plantBa"ons located in the upper portions of the Yalong Catchmenr o- to-the collcetion . ,
and processing centers near the mouth of the Yalong and on the Jinsha River to Yibin. The
Yalong is the principal transportation corridor for timber within Sichuan Province. Forestv
practices in the upper basin are discussed in more detail in Section 4.5.2. Locations o' uhe
primarT forest maagemerareas where *his timber is harvested are depicted in Figure 4.23.
Harvested logs are placed in the river and conveyed downstream to the timber handiine
facilities at Xiaodeshi. Anning River Mouth and others. Most of dhe handling facilities
between Xiaodeshi and the mouth of the Yalong River are constructed of floating piers
anchored in the middle of the channel. At Xiaodeshi, a concrete-pier collection facility has
been constructed along the left bank of the river as showr in Ficure 4.24'.
At these locations the logs are accumulated irnto rafts which are th:n conveyed to the lumb r
mills in Yibin, approximatelv 800 km from the source  in the upper Yalong Bacin.
Generally, use of the river for conveying logs occurs only eurng Til h'g.h flow season
between June and Seprei'ber w'hen narlv 98 pex-ent oi he lozf a.-iv: at the handling
facilities in the reach below the Ert-n Dam si:e. Ail of the zimber ;.a.;diling facifities at the
lower end of the Yalong River are design'td to operate unen dis hargte is at leass ,50C0 mn.rs.
d..   Commercial Navigation
The 3 k!m reach of the Yalon- River from the Ertan Dan; site Eu .;,a conwtuence with tht;
Jinsia River is currentiy unnavigablc due to the presence of shoals and rapids in the ..-er
cnannel. Transportation through this portion of the valley is accomplished via h?h.;2ay
al.ng ooth the left and right banks and via the rail line on the rieht bank throuc h Tongzi.in
Downst-eam from the confluence of the Yalong, the Jinsha River is navigab!e "or
avoroximately 140 km fr.m Panzhihua to Zaogutian. However. this reach is useu o::ti
seasonally in June and December between the extreme dry months and the extrenme wet
months. Between Zaogutian and Xinshizhen, extending approximately 150 kIn, the jinshl
contains many rapids and shoals making this reach unnavigable. The 58 k-n reach be:ween
Xinshizhen and Xiantan is used seasonally, again only duringr the months of June and
341 :2                               4.57.

December. From Xiantan to Yibin, navigation use of the river is possible throughout the
vear. Because the industrial and agricultural production in the upper portions Ot the Jinsha
is quite low. there is little need for mass transportation o;' goods via the river.
There are several ferries present alona this rcach that link highways and provide for persons
wishing to cross the river. Such ferries are located at Qiaojia. Long,ie, Yuzha and Jinjianc.
Numerous boats observed at various locations along the river are used either by local
subsistence fishermen or bv operators of various facilities like the water pump stations
described previously.

The extent of forest (defuned as tree cover great-er ti- 0 percent)' in - the cachmenit-at '    '
present and in the past is shown in. Table 4.10. The increase in the proportion of -.he area
covered by forest from the l960s to the 1970s is due to a program of aerial sowing of tree
seeds in the 1960s. Results of this repianting became noticeable in the 1970s. Prior to the
1960s the practice of cuttng fore!ts and without replanting resulted in a decline in the forest
area. CurrentlY the propordon of thearea With forest cover in the lower reaches of the
Yalong around the reservoir (26 percent) is twice the Sichuan average. In Yanbian County
33 percent of the land area is covered by forest These forested areas contribute significandy
to water and soil conservation in the reservoir area.
a..   Agriculture
About 15 percent of the land within the reservoir area (about 1.700 ha) is cultivated. In
general the Han people occipy the valley bottoms where thicker and more fer ie soils.
combined with long experience with water mnanaggement and rice cultivation, each year
producc two or three harvests of rice. com. wheat, peanuts. sugarcanc and other minor
crops. Pigs and ducks are common stock animals. The Yi people tendl to occupy the hioger
elevations where only one har:est is produced each year because o, the lower temperatures.
greater diurnal temperature variation. slower plant growth, thin and relatively infertile soil.
and frequent landslips. The major crops are potato and buckwheat producing an average of
2250 kg/ha. The main stock animals are goats: sh:ep are found at higher altitudes. The
Rrassv areas of the midd!e mzontane reaions above 1500 m are the most suitable fwor eransc;
below this the grasslands are subject to a long drv season and are of poor quality.
Ecinomic trees in the reservoir region include walnut. chestnut, apple. pear. tung o;l tree.
mulberry. bamboo. and citrus. Yanyuan apples are :._.1 known for their color. smell. and
taste and are an imporLant export commodity.
b..   Forestry
In the Yalong catchment as a whole the timber forests cover approximatelv 0.85 million ha.
EWR EA Cm                             4.61



An estimated 404 million m3 of timber is presenit within the valley of which there is
approximately 9.8 million me of harvestable timber. Spruce and fir trees comprised the
majority of the timber above 2000 m. After cutting, the logs are floated down the Yalong
and Jinsha rivers for processing in Yibin. Most of the logs are cut from old growth forests,
and regeneration/replanting is hampered by diseases caused by indigenous organisms of the
natural forests. The spruce and fir generaly grow on poor montane soils, and plantings often
take 1S Years to form a closed canopy, and 20 years to reach 20-m height.  Annual
production of logs ir. the Yalong catchment reached a peak of 1.1 million rm3 prior to 1985,
with 90 percc-. 1:f uis production transported via the river. Annual timber production has
declined since 1985 to approoimately 0.3-0.4 million m3 in 1994. The reduced production
is attributed to new forestry policy designed to balance harvest and regeneration rates.
In the southern, mainly pine-growing areas of Puwei and Yanbian, the rate of harvesting
pines was, until quite recentld. greater than the rate of replanting. The forest bureau of both
Puwei and Yanbian are currently attempting to reverse this trend through replanting of the
pines in harvested areas. The areas replanted with Yanbian pine seeds and seedlings. The
Forestrv Bureaus expect the seedlings will form a closed-canopy and in seven years, and will
reach 6 m in height in 15 years.
The Forestrv Law enacted in 1989. requires that the quantity of timber harvested from an
area be less than the quantity grown. The purpose of this poiicv is to increase the amount
timner in a given area. In addition. the law requires that forestr management policy
- rcasonable use of timber resources.
- improvement of the forest compositior.
- increase in fores; cornpom;:ion.
- increase in ecolocical and environmental benefits.
- multiple uses. and
- increase in econoi liC beneflts.

Certain forests, such as some of those in the Ganyu Valley, are recognized as important for
water conservation. These are owned by the Deparmet of Water Resources which entrusts
the management of them to the local bureau of the Department of Forestry. Only dead timber
may be cut froti these forests.
Provincial regulations for mountainous regions stipulate that to maintain ecosystem balance,
water conservation and soil conservation, tree harvesting is not allowed on slopes over 40a,
on slopes less than 40° where the soil is thin or replanting difficult, in tracts of i!olated
forest less than 20 ha in area, within 100-200 m of montane grassland or shrubs, within 50
m of all-season streams, and within I kIn of upper catchments. Onlv selective cutting of up
to 30 percent of the harvestable timber is permitted within 500 m of large rivers, or within
50 m of residential areas, reservoirs, and power stations.
In addition to use of available forests for timber, some pine tree stands are managed for
pmroduction of resin. Resin, tapped from pine trees, is collected in a manner similar to the
collection of rubber latex. Distillation of the pine resin produces ros.n and turpentine, the
former used in varnish,- paint, ink and paper industries, while turpentine is used in various
pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.
c..   Industry and Mining
Industries located within the Ertan Reservoir area are generally small and self-supporting.
Repair shops, manufacture of spare parts. a small cement plant. cereal processing, brewery.
sugar refining (Table 4.11) constitute the majority of industries in the Yalong Valley. Up
to 160 active mines are present in the Yalong Valley, most of which are very small with
hrmrted production. The major mines include the Ertan Clay Mine which is exploiting a
deposit of approximately 5.5 million tons, and the Yanbian Hongni coal mine which is
exploiting a coal deposit with approximately 169 million tons in reserve. The mined clay is
important in the manufacture of refractories for the Panzhihua steelworks.

a..   Administrative Units
The region to be inundated by the reservoir directly involves five c-ounties:
- Yanbian and Miyi of Panzhihua Municipality, -and
- Dechang, Yanyuan and Xichang of Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture.
These counties and their adNinistrative centers are shown in Figure 4.25. The most
populous pa.t of the reservoir area is the Ganvu vallev where there are some 630 people/lkm2
and about 40 ha cultimated land/km-. Density of humans in the remaining part of the
reservoir is 60 people/knm2 and agricultural intensitv is limited to approximately 10 ha
land/kan').
b..   Socio-economic Conditions
The socio-economic conditions in the whole of the five ccunties affected bv the reservoir are
shown in Table 4. 1:2. It should be noted that these data were compiled .n 1 98 and revision
of these figures wouln be required if the survevs are reconducted.  ihe apparent rapid
increase in population size between 1977 and 1983 obscr.ed in 'Yanyuan County was
apparentlv due to immigration associated with additional job oppu uities ard the ntflux of
governmental administrators. Similarly, the population growth in Xichang Countv was
stimulated by the rapid groWth of the aerospace industry and the associated infiux of officials
into the countv zovernmcntal agencies.
c..   Minoritv Nationalities
Although most of the people in the project area belong to the majoritv Hart nationality,
another '20 nationalikies are represented. The most numerous o.' the minority naaionalia;.es in
the project area is the Yi. Approximately 39,400 of 168.200 people in Yanbian County are

minority nationalities, more than half of whom are Yi.
There are more than 5 million Yi pcople distributed throuch Yunnan. Sichuan and Guizhou
Provinces. Prior to the end of the Mling dynasty (1644), the Yi people were prevalent in the
project area. At that time the onlv permanent settlement of consequence was Yanyuan.
After the people's rebellion and the invasion by the Manchus in 164. many Han people fled
to safety in the western mountains, where some were taken as slaves by the Yi. Through
the years the proportion of Han incrcased as a result of their fleeing a variety of disturbances
in the low land areas. Finally. the number of Han people moved into the region as a
consequence of organized relocation programs. The town of Yanbian ('boundary of the Yan
area') was founded by Han pcople. probably earlier this century. A result of the immigration
of the Hans was displacement of the Yi into the more mountainous areas which the Han
tended to avoid as much as possible.

Most of the Yi people living in the vicinity of the project confine their activities toareas
above 1600 m  asm edevaion, where they combine cultivation of potatoes, con, and some
whea with te hrdng of goas. Some sheep are also kept but these are as much as for

The goats are very important to dhe Yi because they provide meat and leather, some of which
is taded to the Hlan for supplementary food and material goods (Figure 4.26). Other goods
traded are walnuts, muthrooms, and medicinal herbs.

native to the area and retain much of their cultural integritv.
d..   Cultural Resources
The Yalong vallev has been an important traffic corridor and region of cultural exchange for
centuries. Remains from cultural periods starting from the Palaeoiithic have been found about
160 km south of the dam site in Yunnan. Excavations conducted in the middle of the Ertan
reservoir region in 1979i1980 revealed the presence of Neolithic sites with graves and
cultural objects similar to those found to the south in Da Dun-zi. Yuanmou Count;. Yunnan.
and to the north in Lizou. Xichang County. Sichuan. A thorough survev by provincial and
other experts is currently being conducted and the final repon is expected some nrme after
June 1995.

f.    Public Health
(1).  Infectious Diseases
.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In 1986, infectious diseases known tD occr in the vicinity of the Ertan Reservoir included
malaria, schistosomiasis, epidemic encephalitis, anthra, epidemic cerebrospminal meningitis,
infectious hepatitis, typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, baillary dysentery, and endemic
goiter. In additional there are local problems with hemorrhagic fever and scrub typhus
(Ertan Phase I EA, 1989). In general, the occurrence of these diseases in the general
population has either remained relatively constant or has declined due to actions of public
health agencies in the respective govenmental sectors.
(a).  Malaria
Malaria has more or less been brought under control over the last few decades. and
Panzhihua Municipality was declared free of malaria in 1991 by the Panzhihua Public Health
Bureau. Ihe control of malaria. in part, was the consequence of the massive program of
pesticide appliczauoa to control agricultural pests. This program had the dual purpose of
reducing agricultural losses to insect pests and to reduce or eliminate arthropod vectors of
human diseases, in this case the mosquito.
(b).  Schistosomiasis
Buore 1979, Yanbian County was considered an epidemic area for schistobomias:>
(bilharzia), particularly in Yorj-xing. Jiangxi, Qiansheng and Huimin Rural Areas. The
disease is caused by a blood-fluke or trematode flatworm (Schistosoma japonicum). The
parasite is about one cm long and infesus the veinuoles of the middle and lower intestinal
tract !n both humans and certain other mammals including rats, water buffalo, cattle and
horses. although the domestic species genetally have low rates of infection. The b2sic

epidemiology of an infestion emerges from repeated inoculations of the organism into the
primary host (humans). At low infestations, the disease is generally asympwomatic. Early
symptoms of repeated invasions of schistosomid:. involve.itching of the sldn caused by the
entry of the aquatic larva, and slin eruption around the entry point. The disease mechanism
in humans includes blockage of the veinuoles draining the intesdnal tract, reaction to
metabolic byproducts from the flukes, and tissue damage of the intestinal tract caused by the
penetration of the eggs th-rough the intestinal wall into the lumen of the intestine. The
disease is difficult to treat because various chemical treatments are sensed by the flukes
which then move to the liver until the chemicals are removed from the system by the
uiietabolic processes of the infected person. Because the flukes are known to live for many
years, continued contact with water infested with the invasive form will eventually cause
clinical symptoms to appear. Clinical symptoms include high fever accompanied bv
coughing, abdominal pain and rashes. Chronic diarrhea and blood and mucus in the faeces
are also associated with clinical cases of the disease. In later stages with extremely massive
parasite loads, the disease may progress to the liver, heart, brain, spinal cord and pancreas
of the host eventually causing death. Victims may live for many  .   after contracting the
disease, but become graduallv vweaker, and mans eventually die of exhaustion or succumb
to other diseases because of their weak-ened condition.
The transmission of the disease requires an intermediate host. a small (2-3 mm). iight brown
snail Oncomelonia hupensris These snails are found in the Far East. inhabitinn irrigated rice
fields and growths of aquatic weeds particularly water hyacinth (Eic71ho0ro crassipes). Thev
also inhabit long grass adjacent to rice fields. and in srassv irrimauon ditches. The snails
become infected when feces from infected vertebrate hosts are deposited in the aouauc
environment inhabited by the snails. The eggs hatch in the open water and the iarvac ther.
invade the snai! to mature to the form that infects the vertebrate hos:. As with the ve-l7eb7t
hosts. not all snails in a population are infeaced. However. sufficient numbers car bcc.11M.
infected such that an infection rate of just 1 percent at a very low snail density of lOinr
would provide for approximately 1000 infected snails per ha.  Both the snail and the
vertebrate hosts are required for the parasite to complete its life cvcle. If either of the hosts
are absent from the system or sanitation practices are implemented to prevent introductior.

of the infective forms into either the aquatic system or to the vertebrate hosts, the disease can
be controlled. In south China, the snail occurs most firequendy at elevations below 900 m.
Although the Ganyu River valley is a lkown endemic area, the fact that the Ertan Resevoir
ranges up to 1200 im elevation indicates a relatively small probability that the intermediate
host, the snail, will expand to the upper reaches of the reservoir.
Since 1958, all levels ofChinese government including national, provincial and county public
health agencies have paid more attention to the disease, establishing means of control and
cure through & combination of mass treatment of human sufferers, agro-engineering,
-molluscicides, improved sanitation and health education. This attention and associated
implementation of control measures led to the claim of eradication of the schistosomiasis
intermediate host from the Ganyu basin. However, in recent years it appears that the snail
has once again become prevalent in the area as shown in Figure 4.27 obtained from the
Yanbian County Health Bureau and the Sichuan Provincial Research Institute of Infectious
Diseases (1993). Although the snail is again present in the valley, according to these
sources, no new cases of schistosomiasis have been reported for some years. In order to
ensure the lowest possible incidence of the disease. measures to minimize the occurrence of
the snail and to improve sanitary practices must continue. In accordance with this desire,
measures to reduce the spread of the snail are proposed as part of the socioeconomic and
resettlement programs associated with the Ertan Project. Additionally. immigrant work-ers
to the Ertn Construction Site must be screened before hiring for schistosomiasis. as well as
a number of other infectious diseases, to further minimize the potential spread of these
diseases within the local population. These programs are described in more detail in Chapter
5 as part of the impact assessment and mitigation program being implemented during the
construction of the Ertan Proiect.
(c).  Other Infectious Diseases
The cure and prevention of leprosy in Panzhihua Municipality has been marlkedly successful,
in part with WHO support. and the disease is expected to be eradicated by 1997.
Leptospirosis, a debilitating disease transmitted by rats and rat parasites. is found in Yanbian

to effect but efforts are made to control rat numbers through direct Idling efforts and
environmental sanitation. Scrub typhus is also spread by rat parasites and despite measures
appers to be inceasing in the area. Epidenic hemorrha*ic feve and polio are effectively
absent from the area.

About 90 percent of the population is engaged in agricultral labor. The remainder is
employed in factories, industrial projects, mines, commerce, or the government sector. In
1992 the average annual per capita income in Yanbian County was RMB 455; those working
in industies have the highest incomes, followed by those in government service. Although
those individuals working as farmers have the lowest incomes, much of their food
requirement is obtained through subsistence family practices. Generally, agriculturally-based
families raise not only their own rice and other vegetables, their protein sources (fish,
chickens. pigs, goats, etc.) are also raised by the household.

5. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
This chapter describes the anticipated effecs of the Ertan Hydroelectric Project. The first
section (Section 5.1) describes the environmental and socioeconomic benefits either
incorporated as facilities within the projec structures or attributable to secondary features of
the project. Section 5.2 describes the potential impacts and proposed mitigation programs
for the aquatic ecosystem.  Section 5.3 similarly describes the impacts and proposed
mitigation to the terrestial ecosystem. Impacts to the socioeconomic svstem and some of
the mitigation measures to be implemented are presented in Section 5.4. The impacts and
mitigation measures encountered during the construction of project facilities are presented
in Section 5.5.
Within the framework of this chapter, nine specific mitigation actions are presented to
compensate for anticipated losses attributable to project construction and operation. These
plans include:
i     Establishment of a biodiversit' Conservanon oriamagement zone brweer ene'aion:
1200 m and 1300 m adjacent to the project reservoir, it will cost 1.99 million yuan;
2.   Implementation of a commercial fishe-ry plan and a fish resources recovery plan.
Initially. some 820,000 vuan are needed to establish the program:

program will require 889.000 yuan;
5.    Reconstruction and rehabilitation of the ferry located on the Jinsha River downstream
from the confluence of the Yalong with the Jinsha, and it will COSt 100.000 yuan;
6.    Protection and recovery of cultura. relics occurring within the impoundment zone, and
some 303,000 yuan are required;

7.   Instlation of a warning system downstream from the dam, and the cost for this
program will be 320,000 yuan:
8.    Construction area restoration (its cost estimate is 250,000 yuan); and
9.    Continuation of a public health monitoring program  for construction workers
(approximately 1.22 million yuan are needed).
In addition bO these specific mitigation actions, seven monitoring programs have been
established and will be continued once the project is complete. These are described both in
this section and in CnapLer 7: Project Monitoring and include:
1.    Hydrological. and sedimentation monitoring;
2.    Meteorological monitoring;
3.    Seismic monitoring;
4.    Landslide monitoring;
5.    Aquatic resources monitoring (including water quality, aquatic vegetation and
aquatic animals);
6.    Terrestria resources monitoring (including vegetation and wildlife): and
7..   Public Health monitoring.
5.1. Environmental Benefits
Ertan Power Station on the Yalong River is a multipurpose project with the primarv objective
of electric power generation. During the planning phase, other objectives were identified and
have been incorporated into the overall operation and configuration of the project structures.
These include transport of harvested timber from Sute managed forests in the upper basin
and possible implementation of a fish culture program in the Ganyu River valley portion of
the reservoir (See Section 5.2.6). These benefits and other environmental benefits associated
with the Ertan Project are summarized below:
5.1.1.      Power Generation
ATAM LA CI - C



After completion, the Ertan Hydroelectric Project will play a central role in the Sichuan:       -
Electric Power System. In addition to providing an additional 1000 MW of firm energy yield
to the Sichuan Electric System, the regulation of river discharge will enable a 5 percent
increase in the firm capacity of the Gezhouba Hydroelectric Plant located on the Yangze
River. This increase will be realized primarily during the dry season (January through
April).
The Ertan Hydroelectric Project will also elininate the need to construct additional
generating capacity such as a coal-fired thermal generation station. The energy generated at
Ertan is equivalent to burning nearly 9 million tons of coal annually. Constructioti of Ertan,
then, will avoid potential air pollution and acid rain associated with thermal generating
stations (see Chapter 1).
5.1.2. Navigation
The river channel upstream  and downstream  of the Ertan Hvdroelectric Project is
characterized as steep gradient with frequent rapids and shoal areas. Currently. navigation
is not possible except for a few agricultural and sideline boats and motorized boats owned
by various factories and mines in the immediate area of the project. No commercial boats
currently operate on the river. After reservoir construction, up to 145 km of the Yalong
River and 40 km of the Ganvu River can be used for commercial transportation. This will
facilitate transportation to and from villages in a 5-county area around Lhe reservoir.
particularlv for the villages in Yanvuan County along the right bank of the Yalone River.
Navigation of the reservoir area will create favorable conditions for commercial development
and tourism within the reservoir area.
The Jinsha River, downstream from the project, is only partially navigable. Verv little
commercial navigation occurs on this reach because it is not connected with other navigable
channels. Construction of the Ertan Project and the associated regulation of th river will
not immediately affect navigation in the Jinsha River because of the daily fluctuation in river
discharge. However, when the Tongzilin Hydroelectric Plant is completed, navigation on
ERT EA CM                              5.3



much of the Jinsha River may be realized. The TonL-Oin Hydroelectic Plant WMll be located
downstream from Ertan and will be designed to reregi.tte the flow from Ertan. The daTh'
flow fluctuation from Ertan will be altred at Tongzilin to ' more constant flow regime, thus
providing better condiions for navigation. Major improvei'.ents to commercial navigation
wiU be realized when additional projects on the Yalong are consructed and a larger
percentage of runoff from the Yalong Basin is regulated.
Following completion of Ertan, EHDC will pvi  for the reconsuion and rehabilitation
of the Yuzha .' .y iocated on the Jrmsha River downstream from Jrmjiang Railway Station.
This ferry system currently provides linkage between roads on the north and south banks of
the Jinsha River and therefore is a critical link in the regional transportation network.
5.1.3. Industrial and Domestic Water Use
As currently planned, a water intake structure will be incorporated into the Ertan Project
components to provide industria  water supply for the Panzhihua Steelworks. 1: is estimalee
that the Ertan Reservoir will serve as a source of approximately 50 million ui9 o. water
annually for use at the -steel works and in the town of Panzhihua.
5.1.4. Flood Contro;
Within the Yalong River Valley downstream from Ertan, numerous industrial and residential
areas are currently subiect to frequent flooding events. Facilities at risk to flooding incluce:
umDor receivinc and Eransfer sta:ionz. cLay mine production, coal transi;:; ;a.;i:tie^. a
hienwa%. 110 kv transmission la:r.. <t a     rrizuiur  area. and residential areas associated
' ;t: each of the stations. Currentiy, ai. structures are located above the 100-vear flood staee
ex%t. ,cr facilities located ir :ne :-: channel kthe timber receiving stationsj. Because all
structures are placed above the .IO-year fi'OO stage, the benefit. assc.ia.t  with nver
regulation :t the Ertan Hvyroelecznc Projec: are not great.
040611S
ER tI A4 EA COOS



Because the Ertan Reservoir will not store a significant amount of the total annual discharge
from the Yalong River Basin, significant reduction in flood levels will not be realized.
However. significant flood control will be achieved when the dam developments on the
Yalong River, upstream from Ertan are completed. Currentlv, floods in the Ydlong River
are chaiacterized by long duration and large volumes and comprise approximately 50 pcrcent
of the total flow in the Jinsha River at the confluence. The storage capacity of the Ertan
'Reservoir is relatively small in comparison with the total flow of the Yalong River and will
not have considerable flood control benefit.
5.1.5. Fisheries and Aquaculture
Within the Ertan area. soil, climate and water quality are suitable for production of fish and
other aquatic organisms eaten by fish. Currently, as descrioed above. native fish species in
the river include approximately 100 species in the river. The availability of forage fish and
other aquatic organisms in the river create favorable conditions for developing a commercial
fishery in portions of the Ertan Reservoir.
As is made clear in Section 5.2. the reservoir can be divided into two distinct regions: that
occurring along the original vallev of the Yalong and that occurring in the Ganvu River
valley. After the reservoir is coMNplete. these tno areas .ill remain somewhat distinct with
different water quality characteristics ana different hydraulic c:iaractenstics.
From a fisheries perspective. the main portion of the reservoir may be !ess suitable for
management. However, the expected conditions in the Ganyu arm of the reservoir offer an
opportunity to develop a commercial fisherv which will add to the benefits of the project.
Plans for the commercial fisherv in the Ganyu Arm of the reservoir are described as par. of
the fisheries mitigation plan in Section 5.2.6. It is estimated that the annual vield from the
commercial fisheries could exceed 260 tons from the Ganyu Arm and 160 tons from the main
reservoir area. This production from the open water areas of the reservoir will be
supplemented by a series of "fish farms' located both in the Ganyu Arm and in the main
reservoir area. It is esdrmn ed that annual yield from these fish farms will be 1.000 tons per

2 ha floating net. The fish mitigation program is described in more detail in Section 5.2.6.
5.2. Aquatic Impacts and Mitigation
The construction of a dam, of any type or purpose, has two basic imnpacts that cannot be
avoided. All other effects of the project are attributable in some measure to these two
effects. The first effect is the change in the hydrologic regime of the river. The
impoundment of the river creates conditions which will affect the sediment transport regime,
water quality, aquatic vegetation, and fish populations, both in the impounded portion of the
nver and the reach downstream from the dam. This section presents a description of the
changes to. the hydrologic regime and the consequent changes to other aquatic characteristics.
The second major, unavoidable impact of a dam is the inundation of land resources within
the impoundment zone. In the case of the Ertan Project. 101 kcn@ of land will be inundated.
Description of this effect and other effects attribumable to the inundation are presented in
Sections 5.3 and 5.4.
5.2.1. lhvdrologic Regime
5.2.1.1.    Reservoir
As described in Section 4.3. discharge in the Yalong is characterized in two relativelv
distinct regimes: High flow period extcnding from June through November and a low flow
period extending from December through May (See Figure 4.5). The basic operation of the
Ercan Reservoir is divided into two phases, based on the annual hydrologic regime of the
Yalong River.

Normally. refilling of the Ertan Reservoir will begin in June or July, depending upon when
flows increase in the river. It is expected, based on the historic hydrologic record, that the
reservoir will be filled bv tte middle of July each year. At that time, the Erman Power
Station wilU operate at its maximum hydraulic and generation capacity with excess water
spilled through the middle level spillway. When the reservoir is full and water is spilled.
discharge downstream from  rrxn will be essentially the same as the natnral discharge in the
nver. This period wilI last generialy from mid July through November. However, the
length of time baseload operation will last is dependent on inflow to the reservoir as shown
m Figure 5.1. Once znflow to the reservoir decreases to less than the hydraulic capacity of
the Ertan turbines. operation of the power station w.ll be cnanged to a peaking mrrode of
operation.
When Ertan is operated on a peaking basis water levei in the reservoir will fluctuate
somewhat on a daily basis (some refill will Decur during off-peak- periods and some
drawdown will occur during peak generation period). Because the average daily release from
the powerhouse will exceed inflow, a net drawdown will occur during the time this mode of
operation is implemented. Between December and May each vear? it is expected that the
Ertan Reservoir wi:l be drawn douwn by a maximum o' 45 m during the period when peaking
operation is implemented.
The ainual cycle of refill. spill, and drawdown of the reser:oir is demonstrated in Figure
5.1. which includes a 5-year representative period. As shown in the figure. in some vears.
the resenoir will not be drawn dowr, to the maximum level and in some vears. the duration
of the spill period will be quite short.
5.2.1.2.    Discharge Regime to Yalong River
In June and July, during the period when the reservoir is refilled, discharge from the power
station will gradually increase as more water becomes available for power gpeneation.
mRImd EJi C1                          5.8



Concurrently. discharge to the Yalong River will gradually increase. Although the increa
will be similar to that experienced without the project. the increase will be somewhat later
because of the retention of water to refill the reservoir.
During this period. the power station wil'D be operated on a continuous basis but the release
will be less than intlow to the reservoir.
Once the reservoir is refilled, the power station will be operated at its hydraulic capacity with
excess flow spilled through the upper and mid-level spillways. Downstream from Ertan,
flow in the river will be the same as .t would be without Ertan. This condidor will be
maintained from about mid-July through November each year.
At the time inflow becomes less than the hydraulic capacity of the power station. the
operation of the power station will be shifted to the peaking mode described above. The
effect of this operating modc to the discharge regime of the Yalon- River downstream from
Ertan will vary somewhat, depending upon the amount of water flowing .mo the reservoir.
in general, peakling operatLon will begin il December each year and wi'l conzinuz untii May.
During dry and average annual flow conditions. the daily variation in discharge throtigh the
powerhouse will range from 0 to 1661 m3!s. In average and dry years. generation will beein
at about 0700 and will last until 1700 to 2000 hrs. In these cases. the downstream reaches
will be without inflow for 4 to 7 hours each day. During wet years. power wvill be generated
throughout the day uwith a minimum release of approximately 100  m!s maintained even
during the driest month oi the year. Table 5.1 presents epres-ntative av rage hourly
discharge from Ertan during drv, normal and wet years.
The ramifications of the palking operating period are such that a more detailed description
of the effects to the hydrologic regime downstream from the project is warranted. The
following discussion is based on an analysis of the operating reglme performed by EHDC
and CHIDI. Results of this analysis are summarized telow.

The hydrographs at each of the 6 stations downstream from Ertan, based on this operating
scenario, are depicted for a two day period in Figure 5.2. With this Wpe of operatioo it is
estimated that the wave generated by increasing discharge will move at a rate of
approximately 2.9 m/s. Based on results of the simulation model, the rapid increaser in
discharge will be most prominent in the channel between Ertan and the confluence of the
Yalong and Jinsha Rivers. Downstream from this confluence, the naturl flow of the Jinsha
will reduce the apparent rate of discharge increase significantly. However, upstream from
the Jinsha confluence, the rate of increase may create a significant hazard to persons in or
along the shoreline of the river. To provide a measure of safety for the operation of the
project, EHDC will install a warning system. consisting of a series of sirens and explanatory
warning signs along the river between Ertan Dam and the confluence of the Yalong with the
Jinsha. The sirens will be sounded when the power house begins operation each day to
provide sufficient time for persons in the river channel to move to higher ground.
It is anticipated that the Tongzilin Dam and Power Station. to be constructed approximatelv
20 km downstream from Ertan and approximately 2 km downstream from the confluence of
the Anning River. will allow mitigation of the extreme discharge variaLon in the Yalong
during the period of peaking operation. In fact, the primary purpose of the Tongzilin Dam
and Power Station is to reregulate the flow from Ertan, thereby ensuring a more constant
flow in the Yalong River. In addition. the power station will provide an additional 440 MW
of generating capacity to t.te system. At present, construction of the TongziIin Project is
scheduled to be completea nearly simultaneously with the completion of the Ertan Project.
Delay in completing this project will result in a period of time when the pealding operation
of Ertan will dramatically affect the hydrologic regime of the Yalong and the upper portions

currently monitors conOiuons during tle pre-construction and construction periods, will be
continued after construction is complete and the project becomes operational. Costs for
continuing &he hydrologic monitorin; program are summarized in Chapter 7.
5.2.2. Sedinentation Processes
As described in Section 4.2.2. one of the main effects of the Ertan Dam will be the
disruption of the normal suspended sediment and bedload transport regime through the
Yalong River. n is dis. otion will be realized in two ways. First, the suspended sediment
and bedload carried into the reservoir area will be deposited at the upper end of the
reservoir, both in the main part of the reservoir on the Yalong River and in the Ganyu Arm.
This deposition wiU have two effects: it w-ill Teduce the storage capacity of the reservoir
after many years (see 5.2.2. 1) and it will decrease the turbidity of the water passing thouglh
the Ertan Dam and Powerhouse. The second effect is the reduced inflow of suspended
i.ediment and bedload To the Yalong downstream from the Ertan Project with thc resu;t that
the available capacity of the river to carrv suspended sediiena wilri be increased and sediment
and bedload will be carried out of the taliwater area iut no. be replaced from upstream
sources. This will resul; in son.e scour to the river Dec.
5.2.2.1.    Sediment Deposition in the ELlan Reservoir.
The discussion of sediment deposition in the Ertrn Reservoir is partitionetl into that deposited
in the main reservoir area and that deposited in the Ganyu Arm located approximateiv 19 km
upstream from the Ertan Dam site.
Most of the suspended sediment and bedload carried by inflow to the rsoervoir will be
deposited as the velocity o4 the river slows in the backwater area of the reservoir. The delta
created bv this deposition process will sradually expand toward the dam and consequently
9   EA CS-                            5.13



will decrease the storage capacity of the reservoir. The expansion of the delta will occur
primarily during the high flow season when the reservoir is refilling or after the reservoir
is filled each year when the sediment bedload of the river is highest.
The rate of deposition of sediments in the Ertan Reservoir was estimated using a
sedimentation simulation model. Based on these calculations, after 30 years of operation,
the sediment deposition will extend from the headwaters of the reservouL to a point
approximately 83 km from the dam. Approximately 250 X 101 m3 of storage capacity in the
reservoir will b. !ost due to the accumulation of sediments. After 100 years of operation,
the deposited sediments will extend to a point approimately 53 km from the dam and
approximately 1.070 X 106  3 of' >>Wage will be lost. After 250 years of operadon, it is
expected that the entire reservoir will be nearly filled with sediments. Results of the
sediment simulation indicate that approximately 95% of the dead storge and 55% of the
active storage of the reservoir will be lost after 25 years. These calculations, however, do
not take into account planned construction of other dams upstream from Erman which will
reduce these effects dramatically. Longitudinal sections of the Ertan Reservoir depicting the
status of the sediment accumulation in the reservoir after various intervals of operation are
shown in Figure 5.3.
Based on the analyses, it is estimated that 75 percent of the annual suspended sediment load
will be deposited in the reservoir during the first 30 years of operation. The remaining 25
percent wili be transported through the power station and spillway.
1-. thc Ganvu Arm of Lhe reservoir. sediment accumulation will be somewhat slower because
the infliou of suspended sedimenL and bedload is considerablv less than that observed in the
'alcont. An anaivsis of the sediment accumulation in the Ganyu was performed in the same
manner described for the main Ertan Reservoir.  Based on these analyses, sediment
deposition will extend from the headwater (40 km upstream from the mouth of the Ganyu)
approximately 10 km into the reservoir (28 - 30 km upstream from the Ganyu mouth). After
140 vears of operation, sediment deposits will extend downstream approximately 18 km to
a point approximately 22 km upstream from the Ganyu Mouth. After 270 years of opeation.
the sediment deposition will extend to a point approximately 15 km upstream from the mouth

of the Ganyu. Longitudinal profiles of the Ganyu Arm depicting the extent of-the.sediment -
deposition areas is preset.ted in Figure 5.4.
The above simulations of sedimentaion rates were calculated on the assumption that no
upstreah reservoirs will be constructed. As described in Section 1.4.1, it is expected that
up. to 19 additional dams will be constructed on the Yalong upstream from Ertan.
Consequently, the suspended seditnent and bedload of the Yalong will be intercepted by the
upstream reservoirs and the accumulation of sediments in the Ertan Reservoir will be reduced
to almost nothing. However, because no additional reservoirs are anticipated on the Ganyu,
the estimated accumulation of sediments in the Ganyu 'Arm will be as discussed above.
Sediment load in the Yalong River and the accumulation of sediment at the upper ends of the
reservoir area will be monitored on a continuing basis after the construction of the dam and
power house is complete. This will be'a continuation of the existing monitoring program for
the pre-construction and construction periods. CDsts for containing the monitoring program
through the construction period are summarized in Chapter 7.
5.2.2.2.    Effects on Sedimentation and Bedload. in Yalong
River Downstream from Ertan Dam
Due to the interception of suspended sediments and bedload materials by the Ertan Reservoir.
the sediment content of the Yalong downstream from the dam will be reduced significantly.
It is estimated that the sediment content of water discharged through the Ertan Project will
be approximately 0.19 kg!m3 after 30 years of operation compared with the observed 0.75
k-gm3 currentlv transported by the river past the Xiaodeshi Gauging Station.
The Yalong River between Ertan and its confluence with the Jinsha is approximately 32 km
long primarily in a gorge-type channel. The river in this reach is dominated by shoals and
rpids. The river bed is comprised of big rubble and gravel. Both banks of the river are
characterized by exposed bedrock with only a portion of the reach, between Xiaodeshi and
Tongzilin having some alluvial materials and talus.
EWAN FDA CM                         5.17



Under existing conditions, the bed materials are relatively stable with any movement of
parucles out of the area being replaced by other materials derived frm upstram. However,
after completion of the Ertan Project, the Yalong river bed downstream from the project will
become partially destabidize and development of a new equilibrium condition will strt. The
dessablization of the river channel will be characteized by the redistribution of alluvial
materials within the channel. The pattern of this redistnbution, endured by scour and
deposition hreas, will be dependent upon the opaating regime of the Ertan Power Station.
To determine if significant scouring will occur in the Yalong River downsream from Ertan,
the HEC-6 model, developed by the Hydraulic Engineering Center of the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, was used. Results of this analysis are summarized here. Details of the
analysis were presented in the Eran Hydroelectric Project Environmenml Assessment of 1989
(Note: The EA was translated to English in 1988 and submitted to the World Bank in 1989).
Results of the analysis indicate widespread but ,iinor scour throughout the affected Yalong
River reach with only a few areas of sediment accumulation. During the first five years of
operation, scouring will be most rapid. After this initial scouring process, the rates of scour

will be reduced primarily because the smaller materials in the river channel wull have been
carried downstream leaving only the larger materials which can be moved only at extremely
high discharges. After 50 years of opration, it is estimated that the average scour
throughout the affected ri.er will be less than 0.5 m. Average scour of the Yalong River
channdelupstream and downstream from the mouth of the Anning River after various intervals
of project operation are summarzed in Table 5.3.
Because the Ertan Project will be ope;ated on a peaking basis for approximately 4 to 6
months each year, a further analysis was performed to determine if the surge of water
coming from the power station during the daily start-up of the project will contribute
significantly to the scouring process. Based on the analysis, the contribution of daily peaking
to the overall scouring process will be overshadowed by the scouring processes occurnrng
during the higher discharge periods when Ertan is operated on a baseload basis and water is
spilled through the mid-level spillway.
Because the slope of the riverbank along the Yalong downstream from Ertan is composed
mostly of bedrock, only slight scouring of the margins of the river channel will occur.
Because the banks are composed of bedrock which is resistant to scour, the stabilitn of the
slopes will not be affected.
5.2.3. Landslides
The formation of the reservoir may aggravate the occurrence of landslides in some areas.
It is estimated that total volume of slidable rock mass above 1200 m is some 100 million m;
which is equivalent to just 1.7 percent of the reservoir storage capacity, and equivalent to just
5 years sediment deposition. Between 80-83 kLm upstream of the damsite there are potential
landslide areas on both the left and right banks from which the slidable rocks above 1200 m
total 37 million i3. If major slides were to occur on both banks at the same time, then a
submerged nill would be produced but would have little effect on the operation or life of the
reservoir.
BAX FA C4S                          5.19



Close to the damnsite is the potential landslide area from the Jin Long mountain. Major
slippage here. although of insignificant volume in terms of the total storage capacity, could
be problematic for activities close to the damsite depending on how much material slides into
the reservoir and the configuration of the resulting accumulation of materials.
No mitigation is necessary or feasible for the majority of potential landslide areas. The
potential for landslides on the Jin Long Mountain on the left bank just upstream of the dam
site is being monitored. It is already lnown that one section of the mountain is slipping by
about 10 mm a.nually. It may be prudent and cost effective, compared with the impact of
a major slippage. if rock bolts were installed as soon as possible and the monitoring prograir
continued. Once the project is complete, the Jin Long landslide area will continue to be
monitored to determine if the filling of the reservoir has caused the area to move more
rapidly. Costs for continuing the landslide monitoring through the construction period are
summarzed in Chapter 7.
S.2.4. Water Qualitv
Impoundment of the Yalona River bv the Ertan Proiect will affect the quality of the water
both in the reservoir and subsequently in the reach downstream from the project. lTributarn
inflow from the Anning wi:l moderate the effect to some extent. However. the main
mitioation will occur at the confluence of the Yalong with the Jinsha River. The effects of
Ertan on water quality in the Yalong are treated in two sections: effects realized in the
impoundment and the consequential effects expected in the Yalong River downstream from
the Ermn Project.
5.2.4.1.    Reservoir Effects
As presented in the baseline descriptions, numerous water quality parameters have been
measured in the Yalong River. and the concentrations of many of these parameters will be
affected to some extent. However. the primary indicators of water quality and those for
woe .s
ErTA EA CH>                          5.20



which major changes will occur and uill nave some bearing on the biological components
of the river include three basic parameters: water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and
turbidity/suspended sediment.
To assist in the discussion of the effects on water quality, two areas of the reservoir will be
discussed separately because the two areas will be affected somewhat differently, The two
areas are: 1) The main body of the reservoir along the Yalong River which wiU extend Irom
Eran Dam upstream approximately 145 km when the reservoir is filled to its normal
maximum operating level at Elevation 1,200 m; and, 2) the Ganyu Arm of the reservoir
which extends from the mouth of the Ganyu River valley on the Yalong upstream
approximately 40 km when the reservoir is at its normal maximum operating level.
5.2.4.1.1.   Water Temperature
Given the inflow water temperature, volume of water in the reservoir and hydraulic behavior
of the reservoir due to the volume of inflow and operation of the Ertan Projecr, the
temperature regime of the Ertan Reservoir is expected to be relatively uniformly mixed.
Uniform temperatures from surface to bottom (no stratification) will be present but the
seasonal change in water temperature will not exhibit the annual range observed without the
project. This conclusion is based on several characteristics described briefly below.
As water flows into the upper end of Ertan Reservoir, the velocity through the reservoir will
decrease mark-edly. On the one hand, the delay in passage through the 145 km reservoir will
expose the water to a longer period of warming from the atmosphere and solar radiation.
This effect will be somewhat enhanced by the increased water surface area, further expanding
exposure of the water to the atmosphere and solar radiation.
The factors contributing to the overall warming of water in the Ertan Reservoir are countered
by seveal factors that will serve to reduce the seasonal variation in water temperature. The
primary factor is that the large volume of water in the reservoir will inhibit the overall
warming of the water. Even though the surface area will be larger within the reservoir, the
surface to volume ratio will be much smaller (Surface to volume ratio for the river is
"06 I                                 .
MTM EA CMS                           5.21



approximately 0.2 m2 surface/lm  volume; for the reskvoir the ratio is 0.02 m2 surface/m3
volume). This reduction in surface to volume ratio will zzduce the exchange of heat between
the water and the atmosphere and will result in geerally cooler water temperature in the
summer months (May through October) and warmer water temperatures in the winter months
(November through April) than are observed unde existing conditions. Maximum
differences between the existing water temperature and expected water temperature will be
observed at Ertan Dam.
Frequently, w=er bodies the size and depth of the Ertan Reservoir, become thermally
stratified during the summer months. If a reservoir becomes stratified, conditions become
such that other effects to water quality, such as the reduction of dissolved oxygen
concentrations in the bottom layer, become evident. However, temperature stratification of
the Ertan Reservoir is not expected.
A second factor leading to the prediction that the reservoir will not become thermally
stratified is based on an understanding of reservoir operations and the hydraulic conditions
within the reservoir. As described earlier, the reservoir will be refilled each year to the
normal maximum operating level of 1,200 m bv the middle of July. During this period,
temperature of the inflow to the reservoir will be increasina but is approximately at the
annual average temperature for the river under existing conditions. Because the reservoir
will be rilling. considerable turbulence within the entire length of the river will be present
which wil! serve to mix surface and bottom water thereby creating nearly uniform thermal
profiles throughou: the water column.
Once the reservoir is filled, inflow to the reservoir will continue to exceed outflow from the
Erman Project because the inflow volume is greater than the hvdraulic capacity of the power
station. Consequently, measurable water velocity will be present throughout the length of
the reservoir. The estimated water velocity in the middle of the reservoir may range up to
6.0 cm/s during the high flow season. Near the Dam, the average column velocity during
the during the high flow period is estimated at approximately 2.5 cm/s. Given the storage
capacity of the Ertan Reservoir relative to the inflow volumes, it is estiniated that the
residence time of water in the reservoir will be approximately 33 days. Both of these
IWAN EAcS                           5.22



calculations awe based on a normal operating water level at 1200 m. elevation.. :However,  .
because the reservoir will be drawn down during the dry season, and refilled at the beginning
of the wet season, the induced velocities in the reservoir will vary considerably.
In geneal, the development of thernal stratification in subtropical lakes is quite weak and
can easily be disrupted by wind or hydraulic movemnent in the water body. The energy
required to mix the water column is quite low and consequently, the likelihood of thermal
stratification in Ertan Reservoir is quite low.
The situation in the Ganyu Arm is somewhat complicated by the fact that the mouth of the
Ganyu River is constricted by a narrow valley. -The upper portion of the valley is much
broader and has higher surface to volume ratio. Once the reservoir is completed, the quality
of water in the Ganyu Arm will be dominated by the quality of water in the Yalong.
During the refilling period, inflow from the Yalong greatly exceeds inflow from the Ganyu
(average flow from the Yalong during the high flow period is approximately 3,200 m31s
whereas the average flow of the Ganyu is approximately 150 m3/s or 5 percent of the
Yalong). In contrast the storage volume of the Ertan Reservoir (without the Ganvu Arm) is
approximately 4,780 million m3 and the storage volume of the Ganyu Arm is approximately
1,070 million m3 or 18.4 percent of the total reservoir storage volume. A result of this
disparity is that water from the Yalong will flow into the Ganyu Arm during the refilline
period. Consequently, the temperature of the water will be more closely aligned with that
of the Yalong and the influence of the temperature of the Ganvu River will be limited to the
upper end of the arm. Because water will flow into the Ganyu Arm from the Yalong. it is
expected that considerable mixing of the two waters will occur.
Filling will be achieved in the middle of July when water temperature in the Ganyu is at its
peak (See Figure 4.12). Once the reservoir is filled, water temperature of the inflow from
the Ganyu will begin to decrease. The combination of the influence of the Yalong and the
decreasing temperature of the Ganyu will limit the possibility of creating thermal
stratification within the Ganyu Arm.

When draw down of the reservoir begins in December or Januarv each year. the net outflow
from the Ganyu Arm [(outflow - inflow)lvolume] will be proportionately greater than the net
outtlow from the Ertan Reservoir. As a consequence, the velocity of water moving through
the mouth of the Ganyu River may be somewhat morc than the velocity in the Ertan
Reservoir itself.
The combined influence of the refll/drawdown cycle and inflo v from the Yalong will likely
be sufficient to minimize the occurrence of stratified conditions in the Ganyu Arm.
Additionally, use movement of water into and out of the Ganyu will also create further
mixing in the Ertan Resevoir disrupting any initial formaion of thermal stratification that
might occur.
The basic effect of the Ertan Dam and Reservoir on water temperature. then. is a reduction
in the seasonal range of variation in the Yalong and Ganyu Rivers and a general decline in
the average annual temperature at various locations through the length of the reservoir. The
water temperature will not fall significantly during the winter months nor will it rise
significantly during the summer months. Overall, the average water temperature will exhibit
some what lower annual averages with the greatest difference observed at the Ertan Dam.
The magnitude of the difference is estimated to be approximately 2°C which is based on the
average water temperatures available from the Xiaodeshi Gauging Station. the Yanbian
Gauging Station and the Luling Gauging Station. This is an estimate onlv and insufficient
information is available verify this estimate.
5.2.4.1.2.   Dissolved OxYgen Concentrations
The primarv source of dissolved oxygen in the waters of the Ertan Reservoir will be from
the inflow. Some exchange will occur at the water surface which will be enhanced by the
turbulent flow  in the reservoir.  Inflow  dissolved oxygen concentrations average
approximately 7.7 mg/l.  Based on the analysis of potential primary and secondary
productivity of the reservoir, and the estimated low influx of oxygen demanding organic and
inorganic materials, it is estimated that the dissolved oxygen concentration will decrease
somewhat through the reservoir. However. because of the mixing of bottom and surface
ENTAN EA C46                        5.24



water throughout the water column, dissolved oxygen- concentrions will remain sufficient
to prevent production of hydrogen sulfide and other noxious compounds in the bottom of the
reservoir. Oxygen depletion in the main Ermn Reservoir will be most significant when the
reservoir is drawn down to its lowest leveL However, the duration the resevoir is held at
that leVel is quite short with refilling beginning before water temperatures are sufficiently
high to induce high utlization of the available oxygen.
In the Ganyu Ann, it is more likely that anoxic conditions might arise in the bottom waters.
However, because of the major influence of Yalong River water in the Ganyu Arm,
conditions leading to thermal stratification and the inhibition'of water exchange between
surface and bottom layers will not be prevalent for a sufficiendy long period for development
of significant oxygen deficits in the lower water layers.
5.2.4.1.3.   Turbidity
Because measures of turbidity are not available for the existing Yalong River. the suspended
sediment load is used as an indicator of turbidity processes in the reservoir. As discussed
previously with respect to sedimentation processes in the Yalong River and the Ertan
Reservoir, suspended sediment concentrations coming into the reservoir from the Yalong
Reservoir average approximately 0.385 kg/m3 as measured at the Wali Gauging Station.
This sediment content currently increases to 0.52 kg/m3. Once the reservoir is filled, it is
estimated that 25 percent of the suspended sediment load will be passed through the dam and
power station with some variation through the year according to the seasonal changes in
flow. The suspended sediment load passing through the station is estimated to be
approximately 0.188 kg/m3. Average particle size of the suspended load is estimated to be
<0. 01 mm. The result is that the turbidity of the reservoir will decrease substantially from
the upper backwater to the dam. The decrease will be greatest at the upper end as the larger
particles setde first. However the reservoir will become gradually clearer throughout the
entire length.
A similar situation will occur in the Ganyu Arm. As discussed in the sedimentation
processes, the sediment content of the Ganyu River is somewhat higher than in the Yalong
W7. mA Cmr                           5.25



with an average concentration of 0.76 kglm3. However, the volume of water coming into
the Ganyu is considerably less than tha in the Yalong and total contribution of the Ganyu
to the turbidity of the reservoir will be insignificant. Again, the turbidity of the Ganyu Arm
will be great at the inflow of the Ganyu River. The water will gradually clear from the
inflow to die mouth of the Arm. Annual operation of the reservoir, howaver, will disrupt
this pattem to some degree becau of the inflow of Yalong River watv into the Ganyu Arm
when the reservoir is refilled.
S.2.4.1.4.   Other Wat  Quality Parameters
In general, the nutrient concentrations in the Yalong and Ganyu Rivers are relatively low.
characteristic of an oligotrophic system. Although there will be some accumulation of
nutrients in the reservoir (both irn the main Ertan Reservoir and in the Ganvu Arm), the
accumulation will be limited because of the short residence time of water in the reservoir
coupled with the annual drawdown and refill cycle. Because of the rapid tumnover of
reservoir water and the low concentrations of numients in the inflow to the reservoir,
oligotrophic conditions will likely remain in the reservoir. It is possible that mesotrophic
conditions could develop. If so, total productivity of the reservoir would increase
substantially.
Similarly, concentrations of dissolved inorganic materials are quite low and accumulation of
heavy metals, inorganic ions and organic compounds in the reservoir will not be excessive.
5.2.4.1.5.   Assessment of Reservoir Water Quality Effects
None of the water quality Lffects expected in the Eran Reservoir is significant. Maintenance
of the quality of the water in the Ertan Reservoir will depend primarily on the land use
pratices implemented along the reservoir margins. The primary objective of the land use
is to minimize the potential for erosion from agricultural areas and minimize the introduction
of human waste to the reservoir. Appropriate cautions to prevent erosion from agricultura
areas will minimize the potential for increased turbidity and for the introduction of pesticide
compounds into the reservoir. Appropriate sanitary treatment or other controi will minimize
MMVAa C                             5.26



the introuction of nutrients to the reseroir and will reduce the potential for introducing
organisms and chemicals hazardous to human health into the reservoir wates. No other
mitigation measure is proposed or warrted.
Monitoring of water quality in the resrvoir axea will be continued after compledon and
filling of the project Water samples will be obtned for labomtoy analysis and profiles of
tmperaure, dissolved oxygen and other paraineters for which field instrumeitatdon is
avaiable will be obtained three times annually o ning to when the reservoir is filled,
during the drawdown period and when te reservoir is at its lowest point each year. This
program will be adminsred by the Envinnmental Monitonng Program within the EHDC
organizaton (s Chapter 7).
5.2.4.2.    Downstream Effects
The evaluation of the effects of the Ertan Project is presented for two conditions: Without
and with the Tongzilin Hydroelectric Project which will regulate the discharge from the Ertan
Project particularly dunng the dry season when the Ertan Project is operated on a daily basis.
5.2.4.2.1    Water Temperature
When water is spilled from the Ertan Project, normally from the middle of July to the end
of November each year, tempemture of the water will be only slightly cooler than it is at
pesent. It is estimated that the decrease of water temperature after completion of the Ertan
Project will be approximately 2"C less, on average. This difference will be most prominent
during the months of July and August and will decrease in the September through November
period. By November, water temperature may, in fact, be warmer after the project is
completed than it is under current conditions. These changes are due mostly to the thermal
capacity of the water in the reservoir.
From December through May, the Ertan Project wiU be opeated on a peaking basis, with
periods of no release from the dam lasting up to 7 hours each day. For the most part, the
period of no discharge will occur during the night time hours so that, what water is left in
V'"FAaeCM                           5.27



the Yalong channel between the Dam and the mouth of the Yalong will not be subjected to
excessive warming from the sun. When water is discharged from Eran (from approximately
0700 to 2400 hours each day), water temperature in the Yalong will be slightly higher than
under existing conditions during December, January and February, and will be slightly cooler
than existing tempeues in April and May.
It is expected that some warningtcooling of the watei will occur in the river channel between
the dam and the confluence of the Yalong with the rinsha. However, the rate of warning
will not be sufficient to allow the tempeature to increase to the level of the 1insha water as
it currently does. The difference between the water temperature of the Yalong and that of
the Jinsha, however, will likey not exceed the 20C difference observed at the Ertan Dam.
Once Tongzilin Dam is completed, the rate of warming of the Yalong downstream of Ertan
will be reduced. This will have the effect of increasing the expected difference between the
Jinsha River water tempamre and the Yalong River temperature. Under both conditions,
the discharges in the finsha and Yalong, during any month of the year, are nearly equal.
Complete mixing of the waters of the two rivers occurs relatively quickly downstream from
the confluence and the observed change in tempemure in the Jinsha will be insignificant.
Monitoring of water quality in the Yalong and the Jinsha will be conducted at 3 locations
downstream from the Ertn Project. The purpose of these monitoring stations is to document
tde effect of the project on various water quality parameters by comparison with the values
of the same parameters obtained from upstream of the reservoir and within the reservoir
area. These data will be used to confirm the expected effects of the project on water quality
and will be used as necessarv to provide for adjustments to the operation of the project to
maintamn water quality within the nauonal standards. Costs for continuation of the water
quality monitoring program are summarized in Chapter 7.

5.2A.2.2.   Dissoived Gas Concentrtions
Operation of the Ertan Project will affect concentrations of twu disso.ved gases that, in tum,
may affect aquatic organisms in Fhe reach of the Yalong River downstream from the dam.
These gases include dissoled oxygen and dissolved nitrogen.
5.2.4.2.2.1. Dissolved Oxygen
Water released from Ertan Dam is anticipated to be somewhat deficient in dissolved oxygen
concentrations. However, immediately downstream. from the project, dissolved oxygen
concentrations wiU be highly dependent upon the mode of operation and Lhc presence of the
Tongzilin Hydroelectric Project which will regulate the tlow from Erman.
During the more critical time of the year (July through August) when low dissolved oxygen
concentrations are most likely to develop in the reservoir, inflow to the reservoir greatly
exceeds the hydraulic capacity of the Erman Power Station and the exc-ss water will be spilled
through either the upper or mid-level spilluays. The effect of this spill is that water will be
re-aerated in the plunge pool below the dam and dissolved oxygen concentrations are likely
to rise to at or above saturation. This may be viewed as an environmental benefit of project
operation. Saturated concentrations of dissolved oxygen will likelv remain in the Yalong
downstream to its confluence with the Jinsha. having the furEher benefit of improving the
dissolved oxygen conceitirations in the Jiiisha. The construction of the Ton,zilin
Hvdroelectric Project, wiil have no effect on these concentrations and additional aeration of
the water will occur at the Tong,zilin Dam. again due to spill over Uie soilhway.
During the low flow season, when Ertan is operated on a peaking basis. water with lower
dissolved oxygen concentrationis will be released to the Yalong River. However, the
deficiency is not expected to be great and re-aeration of the w'ater is expected within a few
kilometers downstream from the dam. The re-aeration will occur in the shoals and rapids
which doniinate the river channel between the Dlam and the Jinsha River. The overall cffect
MUTM L.A CS_                         5.29



of releasing deoxygenated water to the Yalong will be overshadowed -by the 4 to 7 hours each
day when no water is released from the dam.
After completion of the Tongzilin Project, water release from the Ertan Power Station will
not be re-aerated as quicldy and the low oxygen concentrations will be extended downstream
to below Tongzjlin. However, the periodic increase and decrease in discharge will provide
sufent turbulence m the river to allow reaeration and a significant adverse effect is not
expected.
5.2.4.2.2.2. Dissolved Nitrogen
Dam operation will also affect dissolved nitrogen concentrations in the talwater are and these
may create adverse conditions for fish-and other aquatic organisms in the downstream reach.
This problem will only occur during the high flow season when water is spiled from the dam
spillways. Because the spiUways-are elevated above the tailwater (upper level spillway is 180
m above tailwater, mid Level spillway is 120 m above tailwater and the low level outlet is 73
m above tailwater at elevation 1007). water released from the spillways will fall vertically
into the plunge pool at the base of the dam. As the water enters the plunge pool. air will be
entrained and pulled down into the water a significant depth. As depicted in Figure 2.4, the
bottom of the plunge pool will be at Elevation 980 and the water depth in the plunge pool
will be at least 32 m. Entrained air reaching the bottom will be place under approximately
4 atmospheres of pressure which will cause dissolution of excess atmospheric nitrogen into
the water. When the water returns to the surface. the pressure will be reduced and
supersaturated concentrations (> 100 percent) may be observed.  The effects of
supersaturated concentrations of nitrogen on fish and other aquatic organisms is discussed
below in Section 5.2.6.
Before Tongzilin is constructed, the turbulence in the Yalong River channel downstream from
the dam may be sufficient-to allow the water to return to equilibrium with the atmosphere
in a relatively short distance. However, once Tongzilin is constructed, the nitrogen
concentrations will remain high through the Tongzilin impoundment and may in fact be
increased further by spill over the Tongzilin Dam.

5.2.4.23.   Turbidity
In general, the major effect of the Ertan Project on turbidity will be to significantly decrea
turbidity in the Yalong River. From the standpoint of domestic and industrial water supplies
and from the pepective of aquatclife, this effect is viewed as a benefit of the prcect. The
mng of the Yalong River with the linsha River wll have also have a net benefit to the
Jinsha River downstream from the confluence of the Yalong River.
Increasing the clarity of the water in the Yalong will have the secondary effect of increasing
light penetrtion into the water. This increased penetmation will have the further effect of
stimulating more productivity from the algal communities present in the river.
5.2.42.4.   Other Water Quality Parameters
With the exception of the parameters discussed above, the Ertan Dam and Power Station will
have little effect on other water parameters identified in the Chinese environmental protection
laws and regulations to prevent adverse water quality in rivers.
5.2A.2.5.   Assessment of Downstream Effects
Although the immediate effect of the Ertan Project to gas supersaturation in the Yalong River
may be considered insignificant by itself, future construction of the Tongzilin Project and
other projects upstream and downstream from Ertan should consider providing mechanisms
to minimize conditions for development of dissolved nitrogen gas supersaturation. The basic
design principle for minimizing the potential for generating supersaturated concentrations of
nitrogen is to minimize the depth at which air is entrained into the tail%water when water is
spilled from the spillway. This can be accomplished either by reducing Lhe depth of the
plunge pool to less than 10 m or by directing the water more or less parallel to the surface
of the tailwater. As has been experienced in the United States, the cumulative effect of
several projects on nitrogen supersaturation is known to have major impacts on fish
populations both in the free-flowing reiaches between dams and on fish populations occurring
in the reservoirs of the projects. This in turn may significantly reduce the potential for
commercial fisheries within the reservoirs.

5.2.5. Aquatic Vegetation
Rooted aquatic plan: species are present ir. the Ertan Reservoir area. Frequently, the creation
of reservoir conditions results in damatic expansion of these plants, particularly along the
margins, which in turn can create unfavorable conditions for use of the resources present in
the reservoir. However, the operation of the Ertan Projcct involving the annual drawdown
of the resoi by up to 45 m will prevent establishment of the rooted aquatic sjiecies,
induding Htdrilla. which in some areas has become a pest spwcies.
On the other hand. there is i significan: risk that floating plant species, particularly
Ekchhornia, may become esmblished in the reservoir. The prcsence of this species in the
reservoir ara (particularly in the Ganyu River Basin) unier current conditions nearly
guarantees introduction of the species to the reservoir unless certain precautions dre
undertken.
At numerous other reservoirs throughout the world, Eichhornia has rapidly become a serious
threaw to not only project operation, but also to public health in the vicmniv of the reservo-rs.
Once established on a reservoir, Eichhornia is known to form dense mats on the surface that
prevent penetration of light and oxygen to the underiving water. The water below the mats
becomes darki and anoxic. As the plants die and sink to the bottom, decomposition of the
organic material removes oxygen from the water resulting in massive fish kills. and the
formation of methane and hvdrogen sulfide gases. In some cases the amounts oi methane
and hydrogen sulfide produced from affected areas have led to explosions and Doisoning of
humans. In addition, these weeds offer ideal habitat for two disease vectors: the mosquito
which is the vector for malaria, and the Oncomelania snail which is the vector for
schiswosomiasis.
With the presence of Ec'homrnia in the Ganvu River valley, it must be assumed that it will
become established in the reservoir and actions must be implemented to reduce the magnitude
of the infestation and to control it on a continuous basis throughout the operational period
of the reservoir.

Although Fichhorna is most certain to invade the main channel of the Ertan Reservoir from
the large catchment upstream. it is noi expected to be as severe as in the Ganyu Arm. This
is due prmarily to the constant vdocity gradients within the main portion of the reservoir
combined with the drawdown refill cycle. Additionally, the constant use of the main area
for conveying logs from Lhe upper end to the dam may inhibit the spread of the weed. If
Eichhorrua does become established in the reservoir. control or the weed in the main
reservoir may be accorriplished by periodically collecting the weed at the log handling site
and moving it through the log passage tunnel where it can be loaded onto trucks and either
sold as pig fodder or placed in a compost pile in an adjacent valley. Use of an herbicide to
control the weed is not recommended because of the water quality compiications arising from
application of the chemical to the water.
To minimize the introduction of Eichhonma into the Ganvu Arm, a pre-impoundment
program to eradicate Eichhorna from the valley is being devised. At least two years prior
to impoundment, a thorough survey of ponds and pools containing Eichhornia will be
conducted. During the first year, all populations of the plant in agricultural pools and
waterways will be identified and destroyed. During the succeeding year, the process will be
repeated. If significant numbers of plants are discovered during the second year, an
additional mission to destroy the plants will be undertaken prior to reservoir impoundment.
Two or three repetitions of the program, on an annual basis, will be undertaken to ensure
eradication of Eichhornia from the Ganyu Valley prior to impoundment.
This eradication program will be undertaken not oniv to reduce the invasion of Eichhornia
into the Ganvu Arm to preserve water quality and to enhance the feasibilitv of a commercial
fisheries industry in the lake but also as a precautionary measure to further reduce the risk
of spread of the Oncomelaiia snail and schistosomiasis. Periodic monitoring to determine
the occurrence of Eichhomia in the Ganyu Valley and elsewhere in the Ertan Reservoir area
will continue on an annual basis in conjunction with the schistosomiasis monitoring, reservoir
area management, water quality and fisheries programs. Presence of Eichhomna in any
portion of the reservoir will be reported to the Panzhihua Public Health Department
(respons ible for the schisEosomiasis monitoring program) for remedial action. The detailed
plans for implementing this program are described in Section 5.4.3.3.

5.2.6. FMsh and Other Aquatic Orpnisms
The changes to the hydrologic, temperature and sediment transport regimes caused by the
impoundment of the Yalong River by the Ertan Project will change the habitat available for
fish from that of a river to onc like a lale This change will alter species composition and
productivity of fish in both the reservoir'and the downstream reaches. The effects and
possible mitigation measures are described below.
5.2.6.1.    Reservoir Fish and Other Aquatic Organisms
The impoundment of the Yalong River by the Ertan Dam will convert 145 km of iverine
habitat into 10,100 ha of lakelike habitat. Although the habitat available in the reservoir
will be suitable for many species of fish, some of the fish currently inhabiting the reservoir
area may require relatively high velocity and feed primarily on benthic organisms and, thus,
may not survive. However, these species wiU likely be replaced, either naturally or through
the implementation of a stocking program to subsidize the proposed commercial fishery in
the reservoir. An accurate evaluation of the potential fish species composition in the Ertan
Reservoir is not possible at this time. Many fish species commonly found in rivers are able
to adapt to lake-like environments with relative ease. For example, populations of Pacific
salmon (Onchorhynchus spp.), which are normally anadromous, have readily adapted to
completely frcsh-water environments, e.g. the Great Lakes Region of North America. Some
species of salmonids, such as the rainbow trout (0. mnykiss) are characterized as having two
forms: one which lives entirely in fresh-water cnvironments and the other which is
anadromous.  Because the habitat preferences and tolerance ranges for most of the fish
species found in the Yalong River are poorly understood. an understanding of what species
are likely to occur in the reservoir cannot be made at this time. For this reason, a program
of monitoring fish populations throughout the year at a number of locations in the reservoir
is necessary.
At least five species of fish inhabiting the Yalong River exhibit seasonal movements between
the Yalong and Jinsha Rivers. Once the Ertan Dam is complete, these fish will no longer
armANEAcm'                      -   5.34



' -  '   '   '    '"   '' '   ''    ''    M'  -- -
be able to move between the rivers. It is possible that some of the populations vill be able
to establish sustainable populations in the reservoir. However, no definite prediction can be
made because the adaptability of these specics is unknown.
The main portion of the reservoir wil have some current (up to 6.0 cm/s average column
velocity in mid-reservoir) but will gradually become less turbid from the upstream end to the
dam. Water temperature will remain rlatively cool throughout the reservoir area. Because
of the current in the reservoir (both resulting from the high flow conditions and from the
drawdownlrefill cycles, many of the nutrients entering the reservoir will be flushed through
leading to the prediction that the reservoir will be oligotrophic in nature.
During the refill cycle, water level in the resevoir will rise approximatdy I m/day. This
rapid rate is unsuitable for fish species that spawn in shallow water in nests and produce
demersal eggs. Species which produce panmktonic eggs will not be affected.
Species, such as arassius aurawus, Cyprinus carpio, Zacco plarypus, Hemicuker bleekeri,
Pseudorasbora parva, Rhodeus sinensis, and RNinogobius giurinus, are known to prefer
lacustrine conditions. These species are either omnivorous or feed on phytoplankton or
zooplankton, both of which are expected to be relatively abundant in the Ganyu Arm. All
of these species are important in commercial fisheries. Several hydroelectric projects, such
as in the Province of Hubei, and in Sichuan Province on the Dadu River constructed in the
1970s, have produced viable commercial fisheries for these species. Therefore, it is likely
that similar fishery resources will become established in the Ertan Reservoir, particularly
with the establishment of fish propagation facilities in the upper portions of the Ganyu Arm.
It is possible that Schizorhorax spp may be able to establish populations in the upper end of
.the reservoir, particularly after formation of the sediment delta begins to form. Schizothorax
utilizes flood plain areas for spawning. The drawdown-refill cycle of the reservoir, coupled
with the accumulated bedloads at the upper end of the reservoir may result in the creation
of suitable spawning areas for Schizothorax spp. Once the reservoir is completed, continued
monitoring of the status of Schizothorax in the main reservoir should be undertaken. This
species is utilized as a food source by local residents.

The conditions in the Ganyu Arm of the resenroir will be more conducive to fish populations.
However, without artificial inaroduction of fish into the Ganyu Arm, fish species likely to
inhabit the area include Hvpophihalmichtkvs molitrnx and Arisrich:hys nobifis, both of which
feed on planktonic organisms. Additionally, omnivorous species such as Cyprnus carpio and
CarassWus aurazu will inhabit the ae and are epected to provide bases for the development
of both subsistence and commercial fisheries.
Because the Ganyu Arm wiU provide suitable habitat for cetain species of cultured fish, an
option of the resetlement and compensation plan under consideration by residents of Yanbian
County is the opportunity to introduce commercial fisheries into the Ganyu Arm. When the
reservoir is at its normal maximum operating level of 1,200 m, the water surface of the
G!anyu Arm covers approximately 2,500 ha. Approximately 1.870 ha has been idenified as
potential area for developing an artificial fishery. Artificial rearing ponds for various species
of fish will be constructed iust beloOv or at the normal operating level of the reservoir.
Spawning stock, fertilized eggs, or frv can be obtained from other hatcheries in the region
and tansported to the rearing ponds to be raised to fingerling size. Approximately 2.4
million fingerlings may be produced annually in these ponds. When the reservoir is filled,
most of the fingerlings will be released into the reservoir.
Of the 2.4 million fingerlings produced in the rearing ponds, approximately 1.0 million will
be placed in "fish farms' constructed of floating nets. In the Ganyu Arm, about 2 ha of
floating nets is currently planned. Within the nets, the fish will be artificially fed with
artificial food of wheat, rice or com. Annual Droduction from these nets is expected to be
about 1.000 tons annuallv for each 2 ha area of farm.
The re-raining 1.4 million fingerlings will be released to the Ganvu Arm o' the reservoir
where the fish will feed on natural food sources (phyto and zooplankton). To ensure the
majority of the released fish remain in the Ganyu Arm, a barrier net may be strung across
the reservoir at the outflow from the Ganyu Arm. This will retain the fish in the rescrvoir
area and will facilitate harvesting the fish. Assuming that the naturally breeding species are
equally productive as the cultured fish introduced into the reservoir and average weight of
the harvested fish is I kg, the expected yield from the Ganyu Arm is approximately 260,000
TAm Ea Css                            5.36



fish or 260 tons per year (approximately 150  Mg/ha) if the harvest rare is 5 percent of the   -
available populations.  Harvest rate from  the mair. reservoir is expected to yield
approximately 160 tons per year. It is expected that up to 50 percent of this harvest will be
from nauraly occurrizik populadons.
The main fish species considered in fte planning effort include: HypopthaImichrhys.
molirrix, Arislich:*hs nobitis, Crenopharyndon ideius, Cyprinus carpio, Carassius aurasus.
parabramus peidnensis, Megalobrama erminalis, and Xenocypris argentea. The fingerling
rearing facilities would be established at Huimin and Yongxing at the upper end of the Ganyu
'Arm.
Within the main Ermn Reservoir area, an estimated 5,300 ha of water surface is available
for fish culture. Fingerling fish will released to the main reservoir in a manner similar to
that described for the Ganyu Arm. Two bavs of the main reservoir, Huangjiaowan arLd
Puwei have also been identified as potential areas for tie construction of fLsh farms. To
facilitate the commercial fishery in the main Eran Reservoir. eigL-. ::i harvest facilities are
planned at strategic locations - (See Figure 5.5). These harvest facilities wi,l consist of
landing and transshipment facilities. Harvest will be acWieved from fleets of fishing boats
using trammel nets (to block escape of harvestable fish) and trap nets (to collect the fish).
A diagrammatic representation of the deployment of these nets is presented in Figure 5.6.

temperature. dissolved g2ses. and turbidity, and the creation of a barrier to movemnent nt fish
between reaches of the Yalong upstream and downstream .from the daIr. When the Tonpzilin
Project is constructed. the re-regulating capacity of the projct wr,ll mitigate much of the
anticipated impacts of the Ertan Project operation.

From June through November, the hydrologic regime in the Yalong River downsmre  from
En will remain the same as curnent conditions. Inflow to the reSeNoir will exceed the
hydraulic capacity of the power station and excess water wvill be spiled through the upper
and mid-level spillways stich that the total outflow from the project will be the same as
existing conditions.
Between December and May each year, Ertan will be opeted on a pealdng basis. Without
the Tongzilin 2roject, during nonnal and dry years, discharge from the project will be
discontinued for period of betweenIA-and 7 hours each day. Although some pockets of water
will remain in the channel between. the dam and the mouch of the Anning River, it is likely
that survival of fish will be limited. Downstream from the confluence of the Anning, some
water will continue to flow but will bedramaticaily reduced from existing conditions through
the 4 to 7 hour period.
Wnen gene-ation begins, the rapid increase in discharge through the reach may be sufficient
tOflu:h any ftish remaining in the cnannel downstream to the Jinsha; Thus. i: is expected tha;
few, it any fish will be able to remain in the channel during the period Ertan is operated on
a peaking basis. This effect will be realized through the entiTe downstream reach oF the
Yalorg to .ts i'outh at the Jinsha River.
Once the Tongzilin Project is completed, the effects of peaking operation %will be largely
raitigated. The Tonrziinr. inmpound-ment wi'il prevent dewatering of the Ya!onc River channel
wher Ertan is not operating. Also, colninuous operation of Tongzilin Dower station throu:h
the period when Er1an is not operatina wiil provide flow through the Yalong on a '4-hour
basi: and will reduce the fushing effect of The initial star up of £rnan eacn uay.
The dailv pealing operating is not expected to affect sturgeon habitac in the .insha River
because the tlow variation will have attenuated bv the time it reaches Yibin as discussed in
the effects of Ertan on the Yalong hydrologic regime in Section 5.2.1.
5.2.6.2.2.   Effects of Altered Water Quality
U- 39.4
A- FA CN6S..4 



As discussed in Section 5.2.4, the quality of water released from Ertan will generally be,
more moderate on an annual basis than under current conditions. During the winter months!
water temperature is expected to be somewhat warmer than under natral conditions and
during the summer months, it is expected to be somewhat cooler. On the average, however,
water relased from Ertan will generally be cooler than under existing conditions.
Dissolved oxygen concentrations are expected to be suitable for supporting fish populations
and any deficit will be regained in a short distance downstream from the project. Reduced
turbidity in the water discharged from Ertan will generally benefit fish populations.
The only potential adverse water quality condition that will arise from the Erman Dam is the
potential for supersaturated gas (nitrogen) concentrations resulting from the spill of water
from the dam into a plunge pool (See Section 5.3.2).
Supersaturated concentration of nitrogen in tailwaters of hydropower dams causes "gas
bubble disease' in fish and other aquatic organisms. Concentrari-s if dissolved nitrogen
in excess of 120 percent saturation is generally lethal to many species of fish. Evidence of
the effect of gas supersaturation is present in the tailwater of the Gezhouba Dam where gas
supersaturation causes an estimated 2 percent mortality in fingerlings. In the United States,
the cumulative effect of gas supersaturation caused by the cascaae of hydropower projects
on the Columbia River contributed sigrificantly to the decline of salmon populations in the
river until structural and operational modifications to the danis to minimize gas
supersaturation were implemcnted.
The conservative nature of dissolved nitrogen in water leads to a potentially significant
cumulative effect of several projects placed in ciose proximitv to each other. Although the
potential for significant adverse effects of gas supersaturation associated with Eran and
Tongzilin may not be greaT. the effects of these projects coupled with similar effects at up
to 20 projects along the Yalong and Jinsha Rivers may result in increasing the observed 2
percent fingerling mortality at Gezhouba Dam to an unacceptable level. As outlined
previously, consideration must be given to minimize the risk of gas supersaturtion in the
planning for additional priects on both the Yalong and Jinsha Rivers.

5.2.6.2.3.   Effects of the Barrier Created by Dam
Ertan Dam will create a barrie to the upstream and downstream movement of fish through
the Yalong River. However, the only migratory species that might occur in the Yalong is
the eel, Angwullajaponica. Based on recent surveys conducted in the Yalong River from its
confluence with the Jinsha to reaches upstram from the Ertan Reservoir, the occurrence of
the eel has not been recorded. However, it-is likely that at one time the species did occur
here.
Additionally, entaminment of fish through the project facilities, either through the power
station or through the spiliways. is not expected to be significant. As described above, fish
populations in the reservoir are expected to consist of shallow water and open water species
and are expected to inhabit the surface water of the reservoir. The intakes for both the power
station and for the spillways will be approximately mid depth in the water column even when
the reservoir is drawn down to its lowest level. Consequently, the potential numbers -of fish
susceptible to entrainment through either the power station or through the spillways is
expected to be smatl and no significant adverse effect to the fish populations is expected.
The expected harvest rates from the reservoir area (equivalent to a mortality rate from the
perspective of the fish populations) is likely to have a greater impact on the fish population
densities than wu1: ary mortality or loss of fish from the reservoir attributable to entrainment.
The sustainability of the fisheries populations in the reservoir is amply supported by the
sustained fisheries in numerous other hydroelectric impoundments such as those found in
Hubei ann other provinces in China.
To understand the effects of the project on fish resources an aquatic monitoring program will
be implemented prior to completion of construction. The program will be continued through
the operational period to identify ary fish resources problems that may be resolved through
a revised management practice. Costs for implementing this program during the construction
period are summarized in Chapter 7. Costs associated with the establishment of the program
are also presented in Chapter 7, as well as in the Resettlement Action Plan for Ertan (1994).
5.3. Terrestrial Impacts and Mitigation
EOTMA A CE S                        5.42
a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



The second unavoidable impact of dams is the. inundation of land- resources. In such cases,
the only altemative that is avaiable is to comp   for the loss either by relocation of
certain of the resources (e.g. wildlife species and humans), or the management of comparable
areas such as designated managment ares or presves to encourage expansion of resources
(e.g. wildlife and vegetation) comparable to those lost to inundation. For the Ertan Project,
the amount of land inundated is approximately 10,100 ha. Losses of vegetation, wildlife and
socio-economic resources and the compensation for these losses-are discussed in this secion
and the foliowing section. A management plan consisting of the establishment of a
management buffer zone around the reservoir is needed to compensate for the losses.
5.3.1. Vegetation
Most of the vegetation to be inundated by the reservoir is of neither conservation nor
economic value. Economic trces such .; Nouella inai..., .oono sureni. Cyclobalanopsis
glaucoides and C. heMreianr that are destined to be subm-rged    |L and removed
durirng the bank- clearing phase. Analysis of the *   ation zone shows that some 2000 ha
of regularlv-harvested fuelwood forest and 1000 ha oi broadleaf timber forest will be lost.
These areas are comvo--ed o: numerous smaller areas ranging in bize from 50 to 200 ha. In
a trivial sense, the loss of the broadleaf forest is of no consequence neraitsc ..o single area
has much signifi-an:e. On the other hand, the presence of relatively undisturbed lowland
broadleaf forest anywhere in the subtropical and tropical zones has been so reduced in size
because of human intervention of various types. thaL the conservation value of even small
pockets steadily increases. Indirectly. the formation of the Ertan Reservoir will potentiallv
affect the vegettion in the vicinity by virtue of the construction of new roads and the
provision of access to various, previously inaccessible, areas (principallv by boat). This
increased accessibility to the higher slopes of the valley could encourage further degradation
of native vegetation types.
To compensate for these losses, EHDC will assume management responsibility for a 10D m
elevation buffer zone above the maximum operational water surface elevation (1200 m)
around the entire Eran Reservoir. Management of this zone will include provision for the

_ ,



socio-economic compensaion plans (e.g. restlement areas, fuewood timber areas, and fish
rearing and narvest facilities) and for the preservation and enhancement of tacts of native
broadleaf forest. Establishment of this manage:ment zone will provide for achievement of
several objectives:
Prervation and enhancement of viable tracts-of subtmpical broadleaf forest;
Control of human occupation ad3acent to the reservoir,
Minimization of the potential for increased erosion along the reservoir margin;
-duction in the Dotential for sediment deposition in the reservoir from
adjacent valley slopes;
Management of timber and fuielwood forested areas along the margin of the
reservoir to minimize potential over-exploimation; and
Reduce the potential for adverse affects to water quality due to runoff from
adjacent areas.
,e etotal area of the managenen: zone between elevations 1200 and 1300 mnis approximately
l .400 ha. Currently. approximately 3200 ha is cultivated either for wetland (rice, etc.) or
dry la.. (com, etc.) crops. In the Ganyu Vallev. 162 ha of the management zone is
occupied b' Yanbian Town and other small nearbv villages. An additional 46 ha of the zone
is currentlv occunii4 by small homesteads scattered around the Ertan Reservoir area. The
remainder of the area (approximately 10,000 ha) is uninhabited bv humans and is covered
by va-2ous iypes of vegetative communities including shrub!grassland (1000 ha): savairnah-
like foxt. i2900 ha); wasteland (suitable for reforestation, 1500 ha): and subtropical
brmaditaf tores; (4600 ha). The prevalence of broadleaf forest in !he management provides
amp'e opportunitv to designate up to 4.600 ha as a conservation preserve for this native
vete;a:Ion ;ype. Such designatior will compensate for the loss of 1000 ha of-native forests
tn tlhe reserVoir area. Desionation of the conser.ation area and management of he buffer
zone will be coordinated with the Sichuan Ministry of Forestry and implemented by the Local
Forestry Bureaus having jurnsdiction in the area adjacent to the Ertan Reservoir area as soon
as the loan becomes effective.

Up to 1,000 ha of additional land may be included in the conservatidon prserves. This, L   -00
ha consists of the wasteland areas which will be reforested through a replanting program.
Plans for the reforestation of the wasteland area includes the planting of native, fast growing
species derived from sources similar to those wiEhin the existing bradleaf forest. Two
species have been identified as potential for implementing this reforestanon program: Pinus
Icesiya var. langbionwsis and Acacia nichii. Initial planting of these species will be in three-
combinations: pure forests of Pinus kestya var. langbionensis, pure forests of Acacia richii,
and a mixture of these two species. The intent is to start the forests with a few fast growing
species and allow invasion of other species into the areas from adjacent mature broadleaf
forests. These forests as well as the existing stands of naturally occurring broadleaf forests
will be protected. Harvest of timber from either the natural or the reeforested areas wiU be
prohibited.
The construction of the Ertan Project will cause the loss of aDproximately 1080 ha of
subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest. a forest type that is rapidly i.iisappearing in siubtrop!ali
China. However. the loss of this amount of forest is offset bv the preservation of 4600 ha
of existing, undisturbed forest which is currentlv not represeated in any of *he preserves in
southwest China. In addition, the manageement obiective of reft;restin2 approxi-mateiy 1000
ha of additional area in the conservation zone around the Ertar. Reservoir wi!] creatc an
opportunitv to evaluate the feasibilitv of reforestation techniques ;n reestablishing the
evergreen broadleaf forest biotype.  WVthott the construction: of the reservoir and the
assumption of management responsioility around the reservoir. the conEinued destruM1cion ,'
the broadleaf forest will surely continue. T'herefore. the loss oi PuSO ha of this i:: . tvmt
is fully compensated by the protection of 4600 ha of nativ forest and the opctuorn ;,t;
expand this total. through appropriatc management. to ovcr 56iJ1 ta.
5.3.2. Wildlife
The available data indicate that there will be no significan: direct impact -of the reservoir on  a
wildlife because most species present in the inundation zone are relatively abundant and
widespread. Some species of waterfowl and wading birds mav be attracted to the relativelv
slow-flowing water and the drawdow-n zoncs. There may. howev.r. be si:itficxl'n indirect

impacts on populations of species inhabiting the broadleaf forests and the higher, more
forested regions. In the absence of adequate data, the conservadve view must be that the
species, sume globally threatened, that are semingly restricted to the broadleaf forests of the
region (Section 4.4.3) will be reduced as human and livestock pressure increases on the
forests of higher elevations unless definitive management actions are undertaken.
.
As described above in Sction 5.3.1, EHDC will assume direct management responsibility
for a buffer zone between elevations. 1200 ard 1300 m adjacent to the Ertan Reservoir.
Designation of conservation -areas to protect the broadleaf forests curently present in the
zone will provide for the preservation of habitat suitable to the endangered bird species.
Management goals seeldng to expand the distribution of this forest type within the
management zone will also be incorporated into the ovemll plan for the management - his
area. Among the management goals to be included in the plan is the provision of full
attention will be given to providing habitat 'corridors' between areas of suitable wildlife
habitat.
5.33. Biological diversity
At present the biological diversity in the area to be inundated and immediatelv around the
reservoir is not -   understood and the impact of the reservoir cannot be ful!v evaluated.
However, it is recognized that the lowland subtropical broadleaf forest. present within the
reservoir area may be important to some threatened species. particularly some bird species.
To provide for the continued maintenance of this forest type withir. the Yalong Vallev.
.1IDC will assume direct management responsibility for a buifer zone ;mnediatcl'
surrounding the reservoir between elevations 1200 and 1300 m. Amona the manapmen:
goals for this area is the preservation and conservation of remaining tracts of; the sub:ropacal
broadleaf forest known to exist in the area and described in Section 5.3.1. However. the
value of these forests in representing the broadleaf forest is not known and specific areas to
be conserved cannot be identified at this time. To assist in determining the integrity of the
broadleaf forests that will be inundaLed and to identify significant areas in the manageTient
zone for conservation, EHDC is planning to conduct an survey of bird species present in the
existing forest areas. A team of national and international ornithologists wiil coi.duct the

-..-,      !    E   {rlb- s .t    -7siaSlz-
survey in the spring of 1995 when many of the bird species are known to be breeding. Based
on this inventory, as well as an appraisal of the condition of the forests within the inundation
zone and in the management zone, specific areas will be identified either for conservation
or for active management to encourage the expansion of this-important habitat type. As the
additional information becomes available, the detailed plan for the management of the buffer
zone (with goals defined in Section 5.3.1) will be formulated.
Available information regarding the distribution of intact tracts of the broadleaf forest
indicates that there is a good opportunity (up to 4,600 ha) for establishing conservation areas
within the management zone to fuUy compensate for the loss of broadleaf forest in the
inundation zone and to conserve valuable representation-of this forest type. Costs for
implementing the management zone plars and studies to support the management pianninr
process are sumnmarized in Chapter 7.
5.4. Socio-economic Impacts and Mitigation
The primary effects on the socio-economic environment will be the loss of various valued
services and obiects as a result ot the inundation. Their impacts are assessed below.
5.4.1. Water Use Impacts
Chanoes to the hydrology and water qualitv in the Ya2ong River attributable to construction
and operation of the Ertan Dam and Power Station have the potential for adversely affectin-
use of the Yalong River and potentially use of the Jinsha River. downstream from the
confluence of the Yalong. Four uses-of the Yalong River have been identified which may
be affected by the Ertan Project. Evaluations of the potential adverse effects of the project
on these uses and measures adopted by EHDC to mitigate or minimize the effects are
described below.
5.4.1.1.    Effects to Structures in and along River Channel

fqTAN s~~~~ c.es ~5.47



The evaluation of potential effects to structures located in and along the Yilong River
downstream from the Ertn Project are made in reference to the changes in the hydrologic
regime and the analysis of bedload aggregation and degradation presented above.
The Misaimuo timber handling facilities, located approximately 10 Ian downstream from Lte
Ertan Dam. consist of a ring-type wood structure connect by several concrete piers founded
on bedrock outcropping in the Yalong River channel. The analysis of bedload tansport
processes downstream from the Ertan Dam indicates that the bed at this site will be scoured
by an average depth of approximately 0.5 m after 50 years of operation. Because the piers
are founded on bedrock. it is likely that the channel in the immediate area of the piers will
not be degraded and the foundations of the piers will not be affected by project opeation.
Nonnallv this facility is operated onlv during the or.nths of June through Septe:mber when
the Erman Proiec! will most likelv be spilling water. the operation of the prqoect on a dailv.
peaking basis will not affect the use of the facilities.
The timber handlinr facilities at Xiacdeshi, Anning River Moouth, Dapingdi, Miupingzi, and
Sanduizi. consist of f.oating booms attched to the shoreline by overhanging cables. The
positioa of these booms can be changed as necessary. Ther are no foundations associated
with thesc facilities and the-fore will not be affected by bedload processes. Tne pr.mary
effecL to th2 'U.Iatl2on of f trese strluctures is that they cannot be operated during the period
when Ertan is .perated on a daily basis. How.ever, because the height of Ltse is assocated
with the high flow pe-iod, june th-rough November. when Ertan will :%e operaLed on a
continuous basis. :nre fact that fluctuatint tlow will interrupt use of the facilities is irrelevana.
During the period when Ertan is operated on a peai;ing mode. the booms may be moved and
stored on the shoreline to prevenL damage. Dependinrg upon the site specific conditions. it
may be possible to alter the attachment cables and positions of ,hc booms such tha. the booms
will rise and fall with the cha!uses in river discharge. In addition, once Tongzilin Dam is
constructed, fluctuations in river discharge downstream from the project wilI be reduced
thereby providing further protection to river channel and river bank structures associated with
the timber handling. facilities.

The Xiaodeshi dtmber storage and loading facilities are constructed`along the left bank of the
Yalong River in an area characterized as having a shallow slope. The facilities are protected
by a concrete and eoncrete/masonry revetment wall which is founded oan bedrock. Because
of the shallow slope of the river bank, river bed scour and fluucuating river discharges are
not expected to adversely affect the storage and loading facilities. Again. once 'rongzilin
Dam is constructed, water velocities will be reduced and potential damage to the picrs and
shoreine facilities at the Xiaodeshi timber handling site will he further reduced.
Structures associated with the Panzhihua bMine Power Plant and the piers of the three brdges
across the Yalong River are founded on bedrock and are not subject toT foundation problems
associated with scour or discharge fluctuation.
Several buildings associated with the Xiaodeshi Hydrologic Station are located along the
Yalong River and are founded on crodible materials. However, based on the sediment
transport analysis, it is expected that the particular locations of the biuildings are in an area
of sediment deposition rather thari sediment scour. Consequently, the risk of impact
associated with flow fluctuation or bedload movement is extremely iow throuah the life of
the Ertan Project.
Near the town of Tongzi!in. downstream from the confluence of the Anning River with the
Yalong, severl residentia! buildings are priesent along the river. However, manv of these
residences are built on bedrock foundations or are on alluvial materials that have a reiatively
shallow slope toward the river. The bedload transport analysis indicates that there may be
some scour of the river bed during SQ vear, of operation. However, the amount of scour is
estimated to be quite minimal and poses no threat to these buildings. Additionallv, the
location of these residences has been identified as an area for por:ions of the construction
staging sites associated with the construction of the Ertan Dam. Consequently, these
residences have been requisitioned by the State and the residents relocated to other, higher
elevation, locations within Tongzilin.
Overall, it is expected that the construction and operation of the Ertan Dam and Power
Station will not cause significant adverse impacts to structures located in or along the Yalong

Power Station.
5A.1.2.     Efects on Dowsrm   Industrial, Agricultural, and
Domestic Water Supplies
During the high flow season, the operation of the Panzhihua Mine Water Treatment Plant
will not be affected by the opemion of the Ertan Project. During the low flow season, when
Ertan is operated on a peaking basis, it is estimated that flow in the Yalong wil remain at
a minimum of 20 - 80 n3/s, derived primarily from the Anning River. Because the intake
for the pumping station is positioned in a deep well, the low water levels associated with the
low flows will stilU be above the intakes to the pumping station. The primary risk to the
water intake at the Panzhihua Mine Water Treatment Plant is with respect to the quality of
the water (primarily from the Anning) during the low flow period. Currently, the quality of
the Anning River is classified between I and II according to the Republic Water Quality
Standards (See above). Towns and villages along the Anning currently use Anning water for
domestic supplies. However, the water is purified and sterilized to meet the Republic Water
Quality Standard for Drinking Water, prior to distribution. The Panzhihua Mine Water
Treatment Plant ;%cilitv is also subject to this standard.
Once the construction of Ertan Dam is completed, the Yalong River will become the primary
sou.-e o: watcr f:r the new Yanbian County Town. Although the pumping station will be
v csi!ncd to accommodate flow fluctuation in the Yalong River, additional precautions will
t'c Inmpiemcnicd to prevent contamination of the water source by sewage discharge into the
ri%C:  Sewa-e discharge will be restricted and controlled along both banls of the Yalong
below the dam and in the area surrounding Yanbian County Town.
The floating pumping staticns located on the Jinsha River between the confluence of the
Yalong and Jinjiang Railway Station will not be affected by water level fluctuation or
minimum released attributable to the operation of the Ertan Project. No impact is anticipated
because of the mobility of the pumps to accommodate water level varatis.

SA.1.3.    Impact on Timber Transportation System
The Ertan Project will create two major obstacles to the continued use of the Yalong River
for transporting harveted timber from the upper basin to Yibin: The Ertan Impoundment
and the Ertan Dam. Because of the importance of the timber harvest to the economy of
Sichuan Province, specific measures have been incorporated into the design and operation
of thq Ertan Project to mitigate the impact to this use of the Yalong River water.
The Ertan Reservoir will restrict the conveyance of the harvested timber through 145 km.
To mitigate this impact, EHDC and CHIDI have incorporated a log handling facility at the
upper end of the Ertan Reservoir. Logs entering the upper end of the reservoir will be
interepted and gathered into rfts of logs. These rafts will then be towed down the reservoir
to a second handling facilitv on the upstream side of the dam.
To pass the logs through the dam. the design of the project includes two tunnels passing
through the right dam abutment. Conveyor belt assemblies will carry the logs through the
tunnels and deposit the logs in the tailwater. The log passage tunnels are depicted on the
project layout (Figure 2.3). The log rafts will be dismantled and individual logs placed on
the conveyor belt to be carried to the tailwater of the dam and power station. The timber
conveyor will consis; of a loading area at the upper end of the tunne.. tne nrachinerv and
conveyor belt structures. and an off-loading area at the downstream end of the tunnel. The
belts are designed to pass logs at a rate of 300 m3/h. It is estimated that approximate'!
11,500 m3 of timber can be conveved per day, based on a two shift operation. Given this
rate. the current volume of 0.4 million m3 of timber can be moved through the dam in
approximately 35 days.
Because the season during which timber is transported from the upper Yalong Catchment
extends from July through September, the Erman Reservoir will be filled, the power station
will be oprated on a continuous basis at the hydraulic capacity, and discharge downstream
from the dam wull be in excess of the 1,500 m31s minimum operating level at the existing
handling facilities. Costs for construction of the log tunnel are integrated with the costs
associated with the construction of the dam and powerhouse.

The only other obsmcle will be the impoundment and dam associated with the Tongzilin
Power station. Measures to maintain the use of the Yalong for transporting the Yalong
Catchment timber will also be incorporated into the design and operation of the Tongzilin
Project.
5.4.1.4.    Effts on Navigation
Construction and operation of the Ertan Project is expected to benefit navigation on both the
"'along and the Jinsha Rivers. These benefEts have been discussed previouslv.

5.42.2.        Living Areas and Agricultural Lands
Although not large in area, one of the major impacts of the reservoir will be the submergence
of homes and cultivated land. Parts of 31 Rural Areas from five Counties will be flooded
by the reservoir, and the homes of over 29,000 people will be lost in both farming and
village areas, mainly in the Ganyu Valley. A total of 1,656 ha of cultivated land will be
submerged, representing an annual loss of over 15,000 tons of cereal production. Some
people will lose land but not their homes, others will lose their homes but not their land,

while others may lose both. If the popuaon were smply moved out of the reach of the
rservoir the area of cultivated land per capita would be reduced by an aveage of 18 percent
and the available land would be of lower aveagc quality than the.land currently used. To
solve this problem, only about 9,000 of the Mfected pople will be moved up above the
reservoir (wihin their administative area), and the remainder wiU be reseted. The people
who move up the slopes can use their compenain money from EHDC to develop the new
l;Id with the- guidance of the county agriculture 1etmenL  EHDC, as owners of the
reservoir area, have agreed to allow the inhabitants remainng in the Ganyu Valley to exploit
the approximaely 330 ha of broad dmawdown areas by way of compenation for the land lost
by the communities (Figure 5.7 and Table 5.5). The options being drwn up by CHII will
be considered by representatives from Yanbian County, and are discussed briefly in Chapter
6 and in more detail in the Resettlement Action Plan (EHDC, 1994). Responsibility for the
development of these areas is borne entirely by Yanbian County.
When resettement is deemed necessary, it is state policy to reconstruct features to their
original scale and wt to cams any lowering in living standards. The loss of Yanbian Town
will be compensated by the construction of a new town near the site of the Tongzilin damsite,
and the boundaries of the County will be redrawn to allow people resettled to remain in their
original administrative area Detailed plans for the resettlement of other displaced
communities have been drwn up and are discussed in the Resetlement Acdon Plan (EHDC,
1994).
5A..2.3.    Forestry
Some 2,000 ha of fuelwood forest and 1,000 ha of broadleaf timber forest in numerous
patches will be submerged These will be compensated for by planting and protection within
the Environmental Management Zone (Section 5.3.1). The forests within the zone, when its
boundaries are finally agreed, will be included in either the protected area or within areas
subject to various management practices and policies. Delineation of the protected forests
as well as the managed forest areas will be determined after the Biological Diversity Survey
(Section 5.3.3) is completed and other requirements associated with the resettlement plan
have been further delineated.

5.4.2.4.     Industry
A total of 12 factories and mines will be submerged (Table 4.11). It is the policy of the
Government of China to rebuild submerged industries to their original scale at another
location. The large Ertan clay mine will lose access to about 1.5 million tons of clay, about
25 percent of the total reserves. The main facilities have already been moved to another site
and are opeational. The Hongni anthracite coal mine will lose 4.5 million tons of its 169
million reserves which are exploited at an annual rate of 0.3 million tons. The impact on this
mine is not considered significant Most of the remaining small industries will be rebuilt in
the new Yanbian Town. Others are relocating outside Yanbian. Costs associated with the
relocation of the affected industries are included in the Resettlement Action Plan (EHDC,
1994).

5.4.3.1.    Effects on Minority Nationalities
People belonging to minority nationalities living in areas destined to be inundated are treated
in the same mann as the majoritv Ian nationality. The more traditional mianority groups
live well above the maximum reservoir levea and will experience no dire. impacts. Local
health agencies report no significant differences between the health of Har. and the other
nationalities. Almost all the construction Workers confine their acti.ities to the damsite and
camp, and are unLikelv to come into close contact with the minorint nationalities. Ever. so,
sanitary and quarantine precautions taken against possible diseases brought by the workers
will be conducted (see below).

is completed and the project is in operation, 3nnual monitoring of the occuirrcnce of
infectious diseases will be implemented. This monitoring will corsist primarily of
establishing reporing procedures from local health professionals who are responsible for the
heaith care of the residents. The incidence of all potentially fatal infectious diseases will be
reported to the respective public health agencies having jurisdiction in the area. These
agencies in turn will provide annual reports to the EEDC environmentl management office
to enable a central information center necessary for the comprehensive administration of the
Ertan HydroeLectric Project operations.  Specific components of the potential effects to
public health attributable to Eran con$truction and operaion are described in more detail in
the following paragraphs. Costs for implementing tnese procedures are summanzea in
Chapter 7 and in the Resettlement Action Plan (EHDC 1994).
5.4.3.3.1..  Malaria
Aplthouch Panzhihua Municipality is now considered free of malaria since 1991, there are two
potenna: impacts of the project which need attention: the reintroduction of the disease
organism into the area by workers arriving from neighboring regions where the disease is
st .l x_val:n. and the potential creation of ecological conditions suitable for proliferatior
v: the mosquito species that transmit the disease. It is likely that populations of the mosquito
%ect; are s:. iresent in the vicinitr oif Ertan. Consequent!y, these populations mav once
again t&zome a...i'c vectors of malana as a consequence of workers coming into the area
-hi, are --:ers of *,;e disease organism. Although in situations where the disease is absent
x;c .. -       .::e  associated with the infection of o,:her humans via the mosquito are
r;..v.& ,..;a;i. safeguards wuill be i:mfernented to further .cduce the probabilitv that malaria
. <...-: re-established a..'jnd Em-rn Reservoir. These safeguards include:
Implernentation of routine program to eradicate mosquito populations in the vicinity
of all construction siLes:
Pre-employment screening o, all workers at the project site to include blood tests for
malaria (All workers are recuered to obtain a Certificate of Verification of Physical
Examination prior .o cor.men:nrg work at :he sites):

-.- -  .       r                 :.,u''     V                       
-     treatnent and isolation (undl cured) of persons found suffering nom the disease,
-     issuance of malarial prophylacics to workers and administraive stff;
-      nmonitoring of mosquito populaions in the vicinity of the construction area; and
-     implementing routine malaria prevention icdons in the area surrounding the eservoir.
Costs for implementing these actions are summarized in Chapter 7.
During the operation phase and while the reservoir remains at its maximum operating level
there are no particular problems related to potential re-establishment of malaria in the projec;
area. However, during the drawdown periods pools of shallow water attractive to malaria
vectors may be expected to form in the flatter and hither areas of the Ganyu Valley.
Consequently, care will be taken during the reservoir clearing process (See Section 5.5.f)
to remove topographic feamres within the drawdown zone that miLI. retain standing water
thmough the drawdown period. Specific areas to be removed are existing irrigation ponds,
fis'n ponds, rice fields and irrigation ditches in the agricultural areas surrounding the
reservoir. Additionally, periodic surveys of the upper reaches of the reservoir, both in the
main reservoir and in the Ganyu arm will be perforned to identifv areas of standing water
that remain after drawdown. Such areas may not be present initiallv but may develop as
sediment from the upper reaches of the drainage basin accumulates at the head of the
reservoir. If such areas are detected, they will be filled or otherwise dramined to prevent
infestation by mosquito populations.
5.4.3.3.2.   Schistosomiasis
As discussed in Section 4.4.3, no new cases of schistosomiasis have been recorded from the
Ganyu River Valley in the last few years. In order to minimize the risk of schistosomiasis
recurring in the Ganyu Valley several measures will be implemented by EHDC pror to and
during operation of the Eran Project. Although the operation of the project itself will not
encourage the spread of either the disease or the disease vector. several components of the

project increases the riskl that the disease may reappear in the vicinity of the project,
particularly in the Ganvu basin, an historic focus of this disea.  Three aspects of tht
epidemiology of schistosomiasis are addressed in various management and monitoring
programs proposed in association with the Ermn Project. These include minimization of the
presence of suitable habitat for the intermediate hust for the diseae (the Oncomelanic snail):
a program to reauce 'the occurrence and distribution of the intermediame host: and the
identification of human carriers of the disease that either reside in the area or have moved
into the area ;- ran of the constniction work force.
The proposed progra to control the occurrence of the water weed, Eichhonua. as presented
in SecEion 5.2.5, has thmee objectives: reducing potendal.effects to navigation and project
operaion. reducing the risk of potentiai adverse effects to water qualiry and fishery
produ:tion. and to reduce the availability of suitable habitat for the vectors oi infectious
diseases. Of principal concern here is the cor.trol of the potential spread of snail populations
known to be vectors of Schistosoma japonicum, the disease organism.
The drawdown zone around tile reservoir may not be suitable snail (secondarv h,ost; habitst.
but :he terraced rice fields and ditches above the reservoir will remain as potential refuges.
In addition there are other locations in China where die disease can still be found and there
.s alwsys a risk that the disease organism may be brought to the reservoir area by migran:
w o6ros.
Durinn che Eichhuinio eradication program proposed for inmpiementation p:lOr :-  __servoir
filiino. a simultaneous surve- of the presence of populations of the snail wil! be conducted.
An% populations of the snail discovered during this process will be eradicaLed preierablv
throuch a combination of mnlluscinide application and removai of the habitat feature. Once
the project becomes operational. monitoring of the occurrence of the disease will be
continued as part of dte overall public health monitoring program described above for malaria
(Section 5.4.3.3).
To rminimize the risk that workers coming ,o the project area as part of the construction force
do not reintroduce schistosomiasis to the area around the Ertan Proiect, each2 work;er is

required to obtain a Certificate of Verification of Physical Examination prior to commencing
work at the site. To obtain these certi'icates. the workers are screened for a marietv of
infectious diseases including schistosomiasis. This program was implemented prior to the
commencement of project construction and continues as a policy of employment by EHDC
and the construction contractors. EHDC will ensure tht the screening and cquipment are
adequate.
5.4.3.4.    Occupational changes
Occupations are recorded in two categories: agricultural and non-agriculiural. In general,
people will maintain their existing occupations, but 2,000-3,000 people from the Ganyu
Valley will switch from agricultural to non-agricultural labor when they are resettled in the
new Yanbian County Town.
5.5. Construction Impacts and Mitigation
The potential environmental effects observed during the construction of the Ertan Project are
generally of a teimporary nature ard stem from grounid disturbance, operation of equipment
and housing of the labor force. Processes which lead to the effects include erosion and
.unoff from construction related areas. production of dus: and noise resulting from blasting
and operation of heavv equipment. emissions and waste oils from heavy eatqipment operation.
and wastewater dischar2es from the housing areas.
5.5.1. Eros;on and Runoff from Construction Areas
Clearing of vegetative cover for excavation and filling of construction areas exposes the
underlying soils and rock surfaces to erosion. In general, erosion from the rock} surfaces will
be minimal. However, placement of fill materials, either for creation ol construction staging
areas or for the placement of spoil materials removed from the tunnels and foundations may
W. EAA CHS                            5.61



lead to excessive erosion. Erodible materials may eventually find their way into the nver
causing increases in the suspended sediment concentrations in the river.
In general, surfaces of the work areas will be either covered with concrete, consist of
exposed bedrock, or will be contained between the main diversion cofferdams upstream and
downstream from the construction site. Additionally, runoff from major construction support
sites will be controlled and directed to settling basins prior to releasing the water to the river.
Clarified water will be skimmed from the surface of the settling basins for discharge to the
Yalong River. Principle areas for which control of runoff is particularly necessary include
the concrete batck plant areas, the aggregate processing areas, and the equipment storage
areas.
Much of the spoil removed from the tunnels and power staion caverns will be stored
temporarily on site and eventually used as aggregate for the concrete. Excess spoil materials
and overburden removed from the construction site is used either for fill in the construction
staging areas or is placed in the spoil disposal area located upstream from the dam in Jinlong
Gully on the left bank of the river. All of the spoil materials will be placed in the gully
below the minimum operating pool elevation of 1155 m and consequently will not be
subjected to erosion processes once the reservoir is filled.
Berms, drainage channels and settling basins will be constructed around all areas exposed to
runoff and erosion. Runoff from most of the cleared and excavation areas drain into the
river channel between the cofferdams from which clarified water is pumped over the
downstream cofferdam.
Following comp' -ion of the construction, the construction contractors are required to remove
all consLructh" a iuipment and recontour and landscape the disturbed areas. Restoration
plans include regrading of the disturbed areas and planting of appropriate ground cover to
minimize erosion and to provide a more aesthetically pleasing appearance to the visible
project facilities.

5.5.2. Control of Dust and Noise Emissions from the Constmction Site-.
Dust from the project area arises from the excavation processes and from the movement of
heavy machinery over unpaved roads: Use of explosives to remove overburden, excavate
foundation areas and tunnels and to obtain aggregate will generate some dust. Dust geerateG
in the tunnels and underground caverns (power station, switchgear and operations cavems)
will be controlled underground and little of the dust will be emitted to the atmosphere.
Noise generated from the operation of heavy equipment and from the use of explosives is
geneally directed upward by the configuration of the river valley. Few residents, other than
the construction labor force, are present in the vicinity of the dam and consequently, noise
generated from the site will not be a major annoyance to large numbers of people.
5.5.3. Handling of Petroleum products and other hazardous materials.
Fuel oils and lubricants required for the operatior of heavy equipment will be stored in
designated areas for which measures to prevent introduction into the environment will be
strictly enforced.
Waste oils and lubricants are collected in the equipment rnaintenance areas and are trucked
off site to recycling centers in Panzhihua Cin.
Explosive materials are stored in appropriate shelters away from the construction site in
Jinlong Gully adjacent to the spoil area. Explosives are brought to the site as needed during
vanous stages of the excavation.
Small amounts of other hazardous materials will be brought onto the site. These materials
consist primarily of organic solvents used for cleaning and maintaining machinery. No
organochloride compounds. such as PCB, will be used on the construction site. Alternative.
non-hazardous insulating fluids for electrical equipment will be used in electrical
transformers.

53.4. Wastewater Treatment Facilities
To prevent contaminadon of the water of the Yalong Jiver, appropriate wastcewater teatment
facilities are construted a: crnical locations throughout the construction site. Each of the
concrete mixing plants is equipped %ith a settling basin to control runoff of waste concrete.
The largest source of waste concrcte is the area used to clean the concrete hauling trucks
betwere loads. Water from these areas is collected into a settling basin and clarified water
is sl;immed from the surface before discharge to the river. Sewage treatment facilities are
also constructed to treat wastewater derived from the three labor camps and the contract'r
housin! areas.
The major sources of uncontrolled runoff and wasewvater that will enter the Yalong River
are the areas inhabited bv immigrants to the area that are either seeldng enployment with the
construction force or are seeking other benefi.s from the presence of well-paid laborers
associated wuith the cons-tuction of the dam and power station. Because the locations these
on-look-e-s" choose for setting up residence and the uncertainty as to the numbers involved.

one year before the diversion tunnels are closed, and that the area will be inspected for
acceptance by EHDC, the Provincial Resettlement Office, Panzhihua Municipality, and
C'IDI. The clearance is a complex operation, and detailed plans will be developed prior
to town implementaion is required. The work will be conducted by local inhabitants, before
resettlement is completed, and they will be allowed to salvage any timber or fuelwood of
value. Remaining organic material will be burned.
S.S.6. Site CPean-Up Following Construction
Once the construction of the Ertan Project is oDmplete, each of the contractors is required
to remove al equipment from the site and clear the site of potentially hazardous materials.
Reclamation of sites exposed during construction will include Tegrading and revegetation.
Exceotions to this will be at certain locations where permanent structures will be remodelled

for other uses or where other structures may be constructed. All sites will be inspected by
governmental agencies and the site clean-up approved before the contractors are allowied to
abandon the site.
5.5.7. Summary of Construction Related Effects.
In general, measures to minimize -the impacts of the construction have been implemented
during the constauction of the Ertan Dam and Power Staion. Potential discharge of sediment
and hazardous materials to the Yalong River has been minimized and no significant adverse
effects have been observed. Provisions are made to control discharge of suspended sediments
to the Yalong River from construction and spoil areas. Dust and noise from the project site
are minimal. Fuel oil, lubricants, and waste oils are effectively isolated from the river.
Adequate fcilities for the treatment of waste water from the project site and from the labor
camps have been constructed. Provisions for the reclamation of disturbed areas following
completioni of construction are in place.
The only effects for which environmental controls have not been implemented is with the
influx of non-labor immigrants to the project area. Although the numbers of persons in this
"on-looker" group will likelv grow as construciion continues, the overall risk of significant
adverse impacts, relative to the magnitude of the projects. is considered relativelv small.
During the latter stages of construction, it is recommended that some consideration be given
to ease the social impact of the "boom-Lown' decline that will be realized in the vicinitv of
ihe project. Of particular concern will be the economic and social impacts that residents of
the small villages lik-e Ton pzilin Station will experience once construction is completed.

Tne site f'or tlhe Hionege resettlement is located in _ hillv area that has a historv of
agriculture. Locai residents have utilized the area for several drv land crops such 2s peanuts,
corn. fruit trees. and grapes (Figt:re 6.1). The site is located along the left bank of lower
Jinsha Thv-:, downstream  from Panzhihua City. The cLaivation of the Hongge areas has
alwvavs been a means of providing supplementary rather than core income for residents in the
viernitr of the site. In recognition of the local residents' previous use of the land, some 200

63. Socioeconomic profile in areas to be inundated
The socio-economic profiles of the areas to be inundated have been shown earlier in Table
S.x. The ousts are, in general, less rural and wealther than the average resident of
Yanbian County or of the reservoir area.
6.3.1. Movement of Poople
T'he sources, destnaions, and numbers of people to be relocaed under the resettlement plan
are shown in Figure 6.2. Based on a survey of the number of persons that reside within the
inundation zone, provision for approxely 21,000 persons will be made. As indicated in
the figure, the majority of the  persons will be relocated in the vicinity of the Ertan
Reservoir with most of them having to move only a few hundred meters. Approximate'y
7,000 residents will be moved to the Hongge Resettlement area located southeast of the
present Yanbian Town. Additionally, approximately 11,000 of the residents will be relocated
to the new county seat located to the west of Tongzilin.
Recent negotiations with the residents of Yanbian County have resulted in the delineation of
another option for the resettlement and compensation plan (Cheng, Sichuan Resettlement
Department, 1994, pers. comm.). During these negotiations, a plan to construct a dike
system along the margin of the Ganyu River at the upper end of the backwater zone was
suggested. The Provincial Resettlement Office discussed this potential with EHDC and it
was decided to implement this program. The dike will prevent flooding of land at the upper
end of the drawdown zones along the Ganyu River and one of its tributaries. Approximately
20 kn of dikes along both sides of the river and tributaries will be constructed to a :eight
of no more than 10 m. This construction will protect the land of approximately 3,000 people

6.4. Consultation process
During development of the resttlement plan, the Provinicial Resettlement Bureau in
cooperation with EHDC, undertook an extensive consultation process with both the local
governments in the areas from which the residents would be removed and with the local
go,qernments in the area to which the oustees would be resettled. Additionally, individual
residents within the Ertaz-reservoir area and in the aireas to which people could be relocated
were interiewed regarding their concerns and requirements. It was on the basis of the
results of this interview process that the decision was made to abandon the Yizhishan area
as a potential area for accepting the Ertan reservoir residents. More extensive discussion of
the results of the consultation process, as currently planned, is presented in the Resettlement
Action Plan (EHDC, 1994).
6.4.1. Methods
Consultation with individual residents of the Ertmn reservoir area was conducted household
byhousehold, starting in 1984. During the consultation process. an inventory of property
and other assets present in the area was made to determine'the magnitude of losses that
would result from the impoundment created by Erman Darn. In each household, the scale and
scope of the project was explained. toggether with its impiications. (It is noteworthv that in
1984. some of the people residing in the project area had never seen a car or train.) Details
of the draft outline resettlement plan were presented to the residents and their questions were
inv~ited. Later, as the resettlement plan developed, all the officials in counties affected by
the project were invited to a meeting in P'anzhihua. The purpose of this meeting was to
provide more information that could be distributed to the people affected by the planning
process. Additionally, representatives of the affected residents were given the opportunity
to visit the possible resettlement sites so they could report back- to their communities what
the conditions were like.

6.4.2. Summary of Oustee Comments
The people to be resettled showed a great understanding of the role the Ertan project will
play in national development and attained a favorable understanding of and gave support to
the national resettlement policies and legal regulations. They were not thrilled with the
prospect of being uprooted but understood that there were legal assurances for proper-
compensation for production and standard of living. Follow up interviews with the people
already resettled indicate that they are satisfied with ther new homes and the much improved
facilities. At their option, some of the younger people elected to move to an urban center
rather than another rural area. Also, some residents requested that they be allowed to stay
in their original area, relocate their homes, in order to cultivate land they had developed
above the reservoir level.
6.4.3. Conclusions
The consultations were useful in the resettlement planning effort. The results underlined the
imperative to provide sites and mechanisms tnat would allow the affected people to maintain
and improve their quality of life as well as comply with governmental policies. A major
feature of the resettement planning arising out of the consultation efforts was that the final
plan be extremelv flexible: This allows for the incorporation of specific requests, such as
permission to stay in the area to work existing land. or move to other locations. Because the
resettlement plan has incorporated their flexibility details of each component are constantly
under revision. The current status of the resettlement plan associated with the Ertan Project
is presented in tne Resettlement Action Plan (EHDC 1994).
6.5. Institutional arrangements
In terms of the governmental administrative structure, there will be no change for the
majority of those affected hy the resettlement program. By redrawing the county boundaries

the people rmoving frnm the Ganyu valley will be govemw. by dhe same instimtions-and staff
that is governing them at present. The oniy major change is that the Provincial Resettdement

developments. This assistance will be funded from a 0.1 fen (0.001 yuan) allocadon of
revenues from every kilovwt-hour of eectricity produced by Ertan. This allocaton, an
estinatedAMB 14,52106 g per year will be paid by EHMC to he Provincial Reseftlement
Bureau for disbursement according w  e final resettlement plan.
The Hor.gge resettlemernt aea is not first-class agrcultral land. but it was the best of tie

agricultural and domestic use, the area wiil provide a zood livelihood for the people. Thne
project will pay part of the cost (power. maintenanccs o; the pumping, which will be
determined after tests in fixed spots, from the levy metitioned above, but it is intended that
once the people's fields and practices have becomne established, the pumping costs wilt be
paid by the people them:seves. It is expected that this will be achieved after 5-10 years; the
situation will be kept under review.

types of data that will be loUected to describe each resource- Foreach monitoring program.
an esimate of the number of staff required to c t-the program is presented togete w.-h
a discussion of the faciity and equipmt requirements for implmenting the programs.
Seven resource areas have been idenified that will be the subjects of the Ertn Evironmental
Monitoring Program. The invesdgations included under ach program are designed to
direcdy evaluate the effects of operation of the Ertan Hydroelectric -Project on the various
resources.   Although EEDC  will retain administrative direction and management
responsibilities for all of the monitoring programs, crtairn of the monitoring programs, as
described for each resource category, will be performed by other governmental agencies
under contract to EHDC.
7.1.2.1. .Hvdrology, Sedimentation and Climate
The purposc ot :is program will be to monitor a -range of hydrological, climatic and
sedimentaton parameters that either affect or are affected by the operation of the Ertan
Prum:ect
7.1 '.1.1.   Hydrology
*A: par! *' Mhe pianning process.-eight hydrologic monitoring stations were established to
mnLvior ::; ;sc-nar_e ir. the Yalong River throughout the year. The baseline hydrology
derived from these stations has enabled planning for project operation. Once the project
becomes operational. river hydrology will confinue to be monitored to enable adjustment to
the operation of the project as required bv the uncertainties of the hydrologic regime.
Additionally. records of the inflow and outflow from the reserv*ir will be used in conjunction
with water quality data to evaluate how the project affects othter resources within the
impoundment and downstream froTr. the impoundemnt.

compiled into appropia  tables and graphs for use in evaluating -the project operation and
project effects on water quality in the resrvoir and tail waters. Annual summaries of
hydrologic data will be distributed to approprate oranizaons. This program  will require
the continued services of 89 saff members.
7.1.2.1.2.   Sedinent Monitoring
Bedload and sediment tansport in the Yalong River is currenty being monitored at eight-
locations upstream and downstream from the dam site and in the Ganyu River. The maiin
concern addressed with the data obtained from these monitoring stations is the accumulation -
of sediment in the reservoir once the dam is completed and the Erar. ReservDir is
impounded. The monitoring of the sediment load upstream  and downstr.e from the dam-  - -
will continue through project operation. This program will be augmented with the additior.
of 46 sections in the main portion of the Etan Impoundment and 18 sections in the Ganyu
Arm at which the accumulation of sediments will be monitored. The sediment accumulation
monitoring stations will be established to-determine if the predicted rate of accumulauon is
realized after the project becomes operational. The information will be used in evaluated the
accumulation of sediments in upstream reservoirs and will indicate any changes attribuable
to the upstream projects when they are constructed.  -
7.1.2.1.3. Climate
Automatic data logging equipment will be used where appropriate. Data will be downloaded
weeldy into a computer to produce graphic summaries of dat. Every month and everv vear

7.122.      Seismic Activity monitoring Program
A center to monitor earthquake activity ifthe vicinity of Ertr. Dam was established dunne
the mobifizamon for construction of the proeacL T.he prpose of the monitoring program was
to derermine earthqua'e frequency and in!tensity a the dm  site t assist in the design of
project facilities. Tne Ertan Project is located in a seismically acti've area at the eastme edge
of the Himalayan U-plift. Monitoring of seismic activity prior to final design was essential
for adjusting design parameters to account for changes in seismic activity associated with
fliling of the resenvoir. T hese desigr. adJustmenst must be a-iade to allow for Dotential
damrac to project facilities amtributable to increased reouencv and intensitv of eardthuake
acrnv;ty. B-e on the oami rela:ive to existing seism:c activity. changes in the fircquncy ana
intensity of earthquakes were predicted. Because of the unceraminty associated with these
pr-edicions. continued moritoring of seismic activit- is necessarv. If. after fillitig of the
reservoir. seismic activitv in.xeases beyond design cnterna. appropra'e operational or
structura nieasures may need tO be im.plemented. Thetrefore. to assure continuitv of the dat
recorc. the existin seismic monitoring program. will be continued through the construction.

potential is located immediately upsteam from the dam site. If, when the reservoir is filled.
this slide releases. the valley immediately upsLram from the dam could become filled and
cause severe disruption of project op on. A landslide monitoring program is ir. operation
to obtain baseline information regarding movment of the slide under pre-impoundment-
conditions. This monitoring program will intensify asithe resevoir- is fied. Or.ce the
resevoir is filled, movement of tie landslide wMi be continued indefinitelv to detect- any -
excessive movement of the slide during project operaton. Continuation of this program will
require the continued services of 12 persons.
7.1.2.4.    Water Quality and Bilogical Mlonitoring Program
The environmental monitoring program  will be established to monitor a varietv of
environmenmai resources representine the natural world widtin the vicinity of the Ertar
Reservoir. This program will inciude water quality monitrinc v. une reservoir and the
tailwater of the powerhouse. The existing meteorological monitoring program will be
continued and various components of the aouatic and terrestrial ecossmems will be monitored
and the mitigation and comp on programrs implemented. This program will also serve
as a repository for the hydrologic data including stream flow records and water level data
A staff of 61 technicians and administators will be required wo implement this program.
7.1.2.4.1.   WVater qualitv
Water quality will be monitored at a minimum of eight locations in the reservoir area and
downstream from the reservoir. Parameters to be monitored vvill inc'lude those contained in   - --
the nationil water quality regulations. Water samples will be collected at least three times
per year for chemical and physical analysis. Results of the analvses wiU be maintained
within the studv program offices. Annual summaries of the data will be prepared. At this
time, EHDC plans to contract with the Environmental Protection Bureaus of the affected
counties to conduct the field data co',lection and sampling efforts necessary to accomDlish this
monitoring program. Water samples for will be transported to appropriate water aualitv

will be reported to the EHDC Environmental Studies P   stafor accumulaton into the -
water quality data base mair.tained by EHDC.
7.1.2A.2.   Aquatic ecology
The purpose of this prograM is tD dbcument how the aquatc commnmity (pi ly fish and
invertebrate populations) responds to the fiLling of the reservoir. Samples of the fish and
invertebrate communities wi be obtained from eight locations within the reservoir and
downstream from the prjec at least three times per year for the fs five- yes of project
opeaton. Results of these sampling programs will ten be used to detrmine th frequency
of sampling to be employed theeafter.
The aquatic ecosYste. sampling stations will be located as indicated in Figure 4.4. Standard
samples of fish populations will be caught in dip. giU and seine nets tree times amually for
3 or 5 years. The frequencies and relative abundances of the fsh species in each sample will
be determined and corredaed witv. esults obtained from the development of the commercial
fisherY. Lengts ahd weights of all fis colletd in the samples will be used to determined
the rive health of the populations. In addition, selected fish wil be retained to detrmine
reproductive state. stomach contents, ar.d the occurrence of internal or external parasites that
might affect the fisherv.
At present. EHDC pians to contact CHIDI and sevei unwersities to conciue: the daa
col'imtion efforts associated w.tn this programn. Results oi the field efforts and any necessarn
ianoraowv anaivses uiH be reported to EHIDC for incorporation into Ohe Yalora Riv.r
em.ivnrxen:itai data bas*.
7.1.2.4.3.   Terrestrial fauna and vegetation
The Purpose of this prog;ram is to monitor changes in. the terrrestrial communi.ty in the
managment area around the reservoir reservoir ae durinc and after the project is completed

is closed. A secondary role of the Ertan Environmental Monioring pam wvll be to.
coordinate the management of the buffer zone around the project reservoir.
Initally, this progam will conduct studies to detrmine the suitability of various areas
around the resevoir for consLvatio of vegetative  pes. rge  for actdve enhancment of
forest conditions and to idenify potential locations of commercial fishn retrieva ars and
oder land uses of thebufferzone. As descibein Secdon 5.3, the staff of this progmwiU
coordinate wit th hrespective fortry bureaus to reestablish native foresf on areas currendy
considered wastnd. Three types of forests will be esmblished, a .Piu kesbia   r
langbionensis forest, a Aca     foes and a mixed forest of these wo- speies. - The
replanted forests will be monitored tO determine the suvival of the seedngs. The forestry
bureaus wil be consulted to idenify sources of the seedlings and to dtermine which areas
each of the three ypes of forest stands should be planted. In conjuncion with the forest
reestablishment and the consemvation of the existing stands of native forests, members of this
group wil also monitor wildlife populations within the natual forests, in the harvested areas
and in the replanted forests. This monitoring will be based on the pre-impoundment
inventories performed during 1995.
The managment and monitonng components associted with the terrestial moniotirng
program will be contracted to the Forestrv Bureaus of the respective counties affected by the
Ertan Project Results of the field data collection efforts will be reported to EHDC.
Mtanagement policies for tne impounment buffer zone will be established, coordinated and
administered bv EHDC in consultation with the respective Forestry Bureaus. The Forestry
Bureaus. in turn. wil implemen: the selected management techniques and will- report the
progress of the implementation to the EHDC Environmental Monitoriv Center.-
7 1.2.5.    Protection and Rehabilitation of the Construction
Area
This program will be maintained fior only a short duration during the construction period and
the clean up of the constrution site. The pmgram wiU have the responsibility for ensuring
that environmental precautions are implemented by the construction contractors and that the

required landscaping and revegetadon progmwrs are implemented as part-of the construction-
demobilization process. This progmm wil require the sevics of 6 staff members.
7.1.2.6.    Publc Hcalth
The monitoring of public health will focus primarily ow the control- o  malaria,
schistosomiasis-and other epidemic diseases that mzy become established in -the reservoir
area Toe monitoring will be conducted by fte Public Health Depatments of the respective -
counties affectea by the Ertan Project under contrc to the ERDC Environmental Monitorng
Ccter. Tne Public Health Departmens Will have- i     reponsiility for treatment and
control of the vectors of both malaria and schirosomiasis and will be responsible for tile
mcllusc and mosquito eradication prograns prior to reservoir fiing. In addition. the public
health. departments will conduct periodic survevs of die project area once the reseroir is
filled to deterrurne any firher remedial measures that may be .required to reduce the potential
for establishment of mosquito and mollusc pop7:lations within tie reservoir area.
7.1.'.7.    rTemporary Monitoring Programs
Two programs will be initiated prior to filling of the reservoir and continued through
construction. Once the project is opeatonal, these programs wlla be discontinued.
The two programs inciude: I) performance of an inventory of the reservoir a   to evaluate
the biodve-sitv o& the imDoundment zone and the management buffer zone: and :)
- n  an mvientorv of natural and human resources within the impounamen zone
nezessary for planning and implementing --he reservoir clearing program.
Currently, the biodiversity evaluation is scheduled to be completed in Spring 1995 by a team
of internationally kn.own specialists. The evaluation wil! be made on the basis of bird
divers:tv as-descri-bed in Section 5.3.
.te inmenrory of human features will be conducted by a Lcair: of specialists assembled from
the Sichuan Provincial Resendement Bureau. the Panzhihua Citv Puolic Hiealt. Department.,
tATAd EA                              7.8



and cultural resource spciaiists from a university in Sichuan. Locio  of -al human
structures and fcilities will be identified for removal. Also, the locations of any -features
having cultural value will be noted along with the significance of the artifacts. As necessary.
culturally significant features wiil be excavated and removed to appropnate iocations.
Although these progamms will be snort-lived, considerable intensive effort will be required
to complete the tasks. The survey-of r       envionrment will require a staff of 31
individuals while the coordination of the rsvoir learing operadon will require a staff- of
22.
7.13. Locations, Equipment and Facilities
The main building for offices, laboratories, and equipment necessarv for contucting the
environmenal monitoring programs will be located near the damsite. probably a ated
with the EHDC headquarters complex at Tongailin. Additionally five live-in field stations
wil be established to provide for various components of the monitoring program. Currently.
the locations of the live-in field stations include:
- reservoir field station at Tuanjie:
- reservoir field station at Gubiao; and
- reservoir field station at Yumen;
- inflow field station near the backuter point;
- dam area field station.
In addition, other stations will be established as necessarv to monitor resources as outlned
in the previous section.
7.1.4. Buildings
The main study center building will have offices, wet labs, dry labs, meetng room. computer
rooms. library, archive. living quarters. Food hall, and cooking facilities. It will house most
of the equipment. The necessary housing for these facilities will be established at the EHDC
headquarters complex in Tongezilin.or at another location as appropriate. Field equipment

7.1.6. Administrtive Frameworkl for the Mionitoring Program
Initiallv. the Brtan Environme.ental Monitoring Program will be administered within the
Department of ManagemerN; of the EHDC. The implementation of the program will begin
with a relatively small g.oup of specialists to assist in monitoring the environmental effects
MAN :A C-0                             7.10



during the construction perod. Through the consuction period the program wi  liiely
increase in size and scope. It is expeced that evenaly, the program will be adminiswred
witin EIDC as a separate Depar.ment.
In order to effectively implement acompehesive monitoring program,. an initial and -
ongoing component of the administaton of the progam will be the coordination of efforts
nEcessary to adequtely monitor the- evironmental effects of the Ertawr Project with the.-
management resonsibilities of various governmental and -management    ons within.
the Yalong Vulley. Some of the organzaio  that wiMl participate in die conduct of the
monitoring and management pmgramms include:   -                  -
1) Panzhihua City Environmental Protection Bureau
2) Environment Protection Office of Sichuan Electric Power Bureau
3) Puwei Forest Mngement Bureau
4) Yanbian County Environmental Protection Bureau
5) Miyi County Environmental Protection Bureau
During the first phase there will be special emphasis on the impacts of Ehe Ertan Dam. With
the increasing capability within the program, the area will increase from the immediate area
of the Ertan Reservoir to the remainder of the Yalong Vallev. Information obtained from
the monitoring program will facilitate the necessary environmental assessments supporting
development of upstream hydroelectric projects. The administrative structure within EHDC
that will implement and oversee the monitoring programs is depicted in Figture .
7.2. Training Program and Special Activities
7.2.1. Components of the Training Program
If the Yalorg Environmental Studv Center is to become of international standard and to set
new standards for the monitoring of, and support for, hydropower projects. it is essential for
a range of taining to start as soon as possible. There will be three general types of training:

of the equipment also compile a list of courses and lecturers to be broight into effect once-  -    -
the study center is operational.
Ih addition to the technical training proa, EHDC, in coordination-with CH1DI, will
conduct an inernational study tour of hydroelectric projects at which various types- of
mitigation and monitoring programs have been established. The purpose of this tour, to be
conducted in 1995, is to see firsthand how many5of the issues raised during the construcdon
Of Ertan and the completion of the environmental assessment have beeh addressed at various
projects throughout the world. It is expected that this tour will involve up to 10 individuals
and will require approximately four weeks to compiete.
7.2.2. Development of Technical Expertise
It is recommended that a 3-5 vear technical assistance package be negotiated within this
project with part-loan, part-grant funding to develop the equipment base. methodologies.
sampling regimes. short-course and other training, library. etc. It would probably be
necessarv to arange for one or more field scientiss to help determine the scope and details.
7.2.3. Environmental Evaluation Panel and Lnvironmental Advisorv
-Board
Two panels of experts are being created to evaluate and provide guidance for the Ertan
Environmental Monitorinc Center. The first group. providing direct monitorinig and
evaluation of the monitoring programs will be the Environmental Monitoring and Evaluation
Panel (See Figure 7.1).  This panei will be - composed of prominent professional
environmental scientists and engineers with experience in addressing environmental concer
associated with hydroelectric projects.. The panel will be assembled from available scientists
and engineers from Sichuan and from other provinces in China who have some familiarity
with hydroelectric projects. the environment of southwesten Sichuan, and other aspects of
environmental concerns as outlined in the regulatory framework. It is expected that this

8. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMLEMENTATION
EDC wishes to makme two recommeundafos to fte Word Bank for te satsoy
compleion of the enmental assessment
1)   It is not possible with the data available to make confident predictions about
the impacts of the project on biological diversity. A comparative survey of
biological diversity using birds as the indicator group in broad-leaved and
other forest and vegetaton  ps should be conducted in the project area,
particularly in the Ganyu Valley. This should be initiated soon, and a budget
of about UTS $40,000 should be allocated in addition to local funds.
Specialist should be contacted to execute this as a cooperative venture with
local scientists.
2)    EHDC has a major responsibility for the integrity of the Yalong watershed.
At present this extends only above the Ertan reservoir. but it is expected to
extend far upstream. An external consultation should be agreed to produce
a formal and detailed short- and long-term plan for the Yalor.g Environmental
Study Centre (Chapter 7). as a prelude to a long-term technical assistance
paclage.

threc years. Some jobs have becn completed, and the other are heing
conducted smoothly. The works completed in recent three years and
implemented in fritimres anid their design are summarized below.
2. Works Completed in Recent Three Years
During pasi threc years, since the start of constuiction or Erian
Ilydrocicciric Projccl. EIIDX has paid much attention to the environmnital
protection. and cond"ctccl it positively according to thc Starr Appraisal Rcporl
of the World Bank (Jimc. 1991) and the design of CHIDI as well as national
legal frameworks. lip lo dalc. EHDC has not only rull-time staff mcmbers on
cnvironniental managemcnt or the project with rocus on environmental
stratCgies' study. rcview or pr posed programs, contract negotiations and thcir
management. but alsn an cnvironmental protecion team wilh morc than 20(X
persons on hydrology. mcicorology, seismicity, ecology and sn on. In
addition. an cconomic management lool, i.e. contract, is adopted to deal with
various cnviron'menal programs, and social expertise or vatious research.

cross-sccions arc required along lhe Yalong River channel with a length o' 31
km abovc the dam.
This job is done by CHIDI. During March - June, 1994, 14 monitoring
section remarks and relevant small blocks of concrete for observation werc
setup, and layout of sections and cross-section drawings with tables or data
and notes were nresenied.
Thc expcnditurc is 165,000 Yuan.
2.5 Watcr Quality Monitoring in Reservoir Area
Somc 8 sampling sites arc selected for water quality monitoring. During
1993, Water sampics wcrc taken in different seasons (dry, nond and normal
seasons) at various sies, and detected with all water quality parameters
specified in the Environmcntal Quality Standard for Surface Waler and
deposited materials by Pan.hihua Enviromnental Proteclion Research Instihute
according to rclevant monitoring specifications and standards. Monitoring
rcsults wcre presented.
This job costed 34.378 Yuan.
2.6   Aquatic Lifc Surveys/Monitoring Before Closurc of the
Coffcrdam
Some R sampling or monitoring sites are selected, same as those for water
quality. One-year (1993, thrce seasons) surveys of plankton. water weeds.
henthos and fish wcre conducted by CHIDI, and a report, fishes samples and
photos werc precented to FHDC.
The expcndittirc is M(UM(0 Yuan.
2.7 Investigation of Environmental Conditions and Mountainous
Harms in Rcscrvoir Region
A completc investigation of the background conditions or the reservoir
(including polluiion sources and their discharges, land use, use of pesticides
and fertilizer. vcgetation, social-economic conditions, climate and distribution
of landslides and muddy flows. etc.) was conducted by .Xichang Hydrological
and Water Resources Investigation Institute and Chengdu Branch of Academy
of Sciences of China with the beginning in June, 1993, and a report was
submitted in AprU, 1994. About 40 professional and technical personnel were
involved.

and regulations or linc Governments of P.R. China to deal with environmental
protection or the consiruction areas with die methods and tools agrced by the
projecl owner. to mcet IhC reasonable requirements of the owner, and to
receive monitoring and supervision of line governments or China and the
owner.
At prcsent. wastc malerials are collected and stored in special areas. waste
water from concretc plant and equipment washing is transferred into sediment
basin. and then discharged after deposition.
Drinking water for workcrs is mainly pumped from deep wells, and
delected periodically. It must meet relevant standards before drinking use.
Sevcral first-aid stations are established. The hospital set up by the
Hydroelectric Construction Bureau No. 8 of China has relatively complete
profes,sional sections and medical equipment to treat general health problems.
Underground  construction  environment should  meet the  relevant
regulations of the labor proicction specifications of China. The concentrations
of suspended particlec. CO and frT.e SiO2 were detcted at the working faces
of the right and lcft divcrsion tunnels by Panzhihua Sanitation and Anti-
epidemic Station with contract with EHDC in November 1992. a hygicnic
evaluation and somc recommcndations for enforcing labor protection werc
presented.
In April 1993. Panzhihua Environmental Protection Agency reviewed the
environmcntal protection- work of the construction area pursuant to Laws, and
requcsied thc contractors to rcport their pollution discharges. and defined
periods for pollution Ircamcnt for the contractors whom discharged wastes
excecding rcelvant standards.
