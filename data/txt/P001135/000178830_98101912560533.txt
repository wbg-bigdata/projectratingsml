IVORY COAST
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY & SEWERAGE SECTOR
Introduction
1.01      The Ivory Coast has a population of about 8.1 million, of which
3.1 million are urban residents, on a land area of about 333,000 km2. The
Ivory Coast is thus one of the region's most urbanised countries (38%). The
urban population growth rate has been about 8.4% p.a., about double that of
the country's population growth rate as a whole. This extremely high growth
rate is largely explained by the large scale immigration of non-Ivorians
over the last decade.
1.02      The Government has over the last six years expanded urban public
services at a high rate, in particular the water supply services for secondary
cities. It was able to do this using the manpower and financial resources
of the existing well-organized water supply service, which in 1974 was mainly
in Abidjan.
Sector Organization
1.03      The structure of the water supply, sewerage and drainage sector in
Ivory Coast presents an unusual pattern of shared responsibility, in which
operation and maintenance, capital works, and capital finance are each assigned
to different agencies. However, the Government retains the ownership of sector
assets (with minor exceptions) as well as the authority to establish sector
policy and to determine tariff levels. Tariffs are high, but a sharply
reduced "social tariff" benefits the small consumer (para 5.05).
1.04      In the water supply sector, the distribution of responsibility is
as follows:
(i)  The planning, design, and construction of substantially all water
supply facilities are the responsibility of Direction Centrale de
l'Hydraulique (DCH), a sub-division of the Ministry of Public
Works; DCH also supervises SODECI on the Government's behalf;
(ii)  Operation and maintenance are assigned to Societe de Distribution
d'Eau de la Cote d'Ivoire (SODECI), a private company, which then
bills and collects water and sewer rates and also the levies on
private groundwater extraction; and
(iii) The management of debt and capital finance is the function of Fonds
National de l'Hydraulique (FNH), an autonomous Government agency
linked to the Ministry of Finance and Economy.
These entities are discussed in more detail in Chapter IV.



-2-
1.05        In the sewerage and drainage sector, a similar structure prevails--
operation and maintenance are carried out by SODECI, as agent for Societe
d'Equipement des Terrains Urbains (SETU), a Government land development
company; SETU plans and executes capital works, and is likely to assume
increasingly operational responsibilities, particularly in respect of large
new pumping and treatment plants coming on stream; and capital finance and
debt are managed by Fonds National de l'Assainissement (FNA), a sister-agency
of FNH. There is also a Direction Centrale de l'Assainissement responsible
for general sector supervision.
1.06        This fragmented institutional structure, while seemingly violating
all the accepted canons, in fact works effectively and well. The large
investment program remains under the direct control of the Ministry of Works,
the financing of those investments is supervised by the Ministry of Finance,
and day-to-day operation, maintenance and revenue collection are run effi-
ciently by a private enterprise. Each agency is able to concentrate its
efforts on its own particular task; and the inherent risk of inter-agency
friction is offset by the checks and balances afforded by the tripartite
responsibility. There are moreover certain financial advantages, discussed in
Chapter V.
1.07      Nevertheless, further ways need to be explored towards long-term
stream-lining of the sector organization. For example, it might be desirable,
as a first step, to transfer responsibility for extension and improvement
of existing water supply systems to SODECI under control of the Ministry oi-
Public Works; a greater share of the burden of village water supply could be
transferred to the rural consumers, perhaps as part of integrated rural
development programs; and eventually, FNH might possibly be phased out, once
the present massive borrowing program is out of the way and all urban centers
have been equipped. The whole question of future development of the sector's
institutional structure and finance will be studied as part of the proposed
project (para. 3.03 and Annex 3-3).
Water Resources
1.08      The Ivory Coast is blessed with abundant rainfall in the south,
for example Abidjan (2,090 mm per annum), having no month without rain; with
gradually diminishing rainfall further north, the north being a savannah type
countryside (see map IBRD 15773). There exist two rainy seasons in the souath,
May-July and October-November, which gradually merge into one season further
north.
1.09      The coastal zone from Sassandra to the Ghanaian border is the
only area where ground water is found in large quantity. In most of the rest
of the country groundwater is found in small quantities, sufficient for
village well use and small pumped systems. Ten years ago groundwater use for
areas outside the coastal zone had been ruled out as too expensive because of
the difficult geological structure. However with the use of modern techniques,
principally hydrogeological analysis of aerial photos, enormous progress has
been made in recent years in detecting favourable drill sites.



-3-
1.10      Currently Abidjan is supplied entirely from groundwater.  About
one third of the surface water systems for the secondary centers have dammed
storage, to tide them over the annual dry periods.
Piped Water Supply
1.11      Potable water supply systems in the Ivory Coast provide possibly
the best service in West Africa. As of end 1980, Abidjan, Bouake and 91 other
centers had piped water supply facilities. During 1975-80, it is estimated
that the number of urban population served directly or indirectly has increased
from 800,000 to 1.7 million, which is impressive; however, because of offset-
ting population increase, the percentage of urban population served increased
from about 37 to only 55%. In addition 96 villages are served with rudimentary
piped systems. The systems are generally well designed, equipped, maintained
and operated. Water is universally metered, and unaccounted for water is
quite low at about 18% in Abidjan and at an average of about 20% elsewhere.
About 60% of Abidjan's population is served by direct connections, while on
average 25% of the families are directly served in secondary centers. As a
result of the commercial orientation of the Ivory Coast water sector public
fountains are generally limited to service areas, such as markets and bus
stops, as well as outlying traditional housing. However private water sales
points are numerous, especially in Abidjan.
Village Wells
1.12      Provision of water to rural areas has been equally successful.  The
village well program, which started in 1976, had constructed about 6,000 wells
by the end of 1980 and is expected to achieve its goal of 10,500 wells by 1982.
This is to be compared with the 1,000 wells existing in the whole of the
country in 1975. The rural population with access to potable water from wells
has increased from'less than 1 million to 3.3 million (66%) during 1975-80.
The rural program is planned to provide a well to every village with more than
100 inhabitants and an additional well for each 600 inhabitants over the first
900 inhabitants. The emphasis is gradually shifting from mechanically con-
structed dug wells to drilled wells. Maintenance of the well equipment is
provided by SODECI's regional maintenance teams.
1.13      The program was conceived at the right moment, when new techniques
of well location by aerial photography had become available. The program
has also been used to try out and develop further a newly invented deep well
hand pump, which is more sophisticated in design but permits much easier
maintenance. In general it can be concluded that in addition to providing a
better local service, this program has provided experience, which is now being
applied elsewhere in West Africa.
Sanitation
1.14      Only Abidjan has a sewerage and drainage system, which is being
developed in a well planned way. The urban concentrations in the rest of
the country are not high enough to warrant central sewer systems and the
population relies on pit latrines and septic tanks. Drainage and sanitation



- 4 -
master plans have been studied for all important urban centers (65) outside
Abidjan; however, no major works are expected shortly as the Government ha&.
recently decided to freeze all major investments in this sector outside
Abidjan. It is expected that medium-term priorities will be oriented to
drainage and to collection and disposal of garbage.
Recent Investments in Water Supply
1.15      Investments in the water supply sector have heavily favored tne
interior of the country to a degree that the "bread winner", the Abidjan
system (which provides 70% of the total revenue) has accumulated a backlog
of necessary works. Over the period 1975-1979 the investments in the whole
sector amounted to US$260 million equivalent, of which about 10% was invested
in Abidjan, 65% in secondary centers and 25% in village wells.
Recent Investments in Sanitation
1.16      The only sizeable investments in sewerage and drainage were in
Abidjan. The period 1975-1979 was the first time that a coordinated start
was made in building up an organization for, and investing in, Abidjan.
The total investments made over this period amounted only to US$25 million
equivalent, rising from practically nil in 1975 to US$10 million in 1979.
1.17      It has been the Government's aim to reduce the disparities in
living conditions between the various parts of the country and, in particular
between the capital and the rest of the country.  The main program to further
this aim has been the development of agriculture: coffee, cocoa, palm oil,
cotton, sugar etc. In support of these programs the Government has promotecL
extension and improvement of infrastructure throughout the country, thus
upgrading living conditions, while at the same time reducing-the appeal of the
large centers to rural and semi-rural population.
Water Supply Sector Objectives
1.18      The Government thus continues to emphasize development of water
supply as one of the high priority areas of its urban infrastructure progrem.
In February 1981 the council of ministers adopted a revised version of the
original 1974 water supply development plan, which now appears as follows;
(i) extending and modernizing existing water supply systems, so as
to make optimum use of its past investments and with marginal
new investments to follow demand due to population growth;
(ii)  providing every "prefecture" and "sub-prefecture" with a water
supply system, with the exception of centers with less than 3,000
inhabitants, which are deferred to after 1985; and
(iii)  completing its original 1974 (11,000 wells) program by 1982 and
constructing 4,000 additional wells during 1982-1985.
These objectives form the updated basis of a 12-year water supply developme.nt
program, which when completed in 1985 will have:



[) mainiained the percentage of urban population having house connec-
tions at the present 60% in Abidjan and increased the percentage
from 25% to 33% in the centers in the interior, thus providing water
to more than 550,000 additional consumers; and
(ii) provided every village of over 100 inhabitants with a well and
a minimum served population per well of 400 inhabitants.
It must be realised, however, that during 1980-1985 the population of Abidjan
and the other urban centers will have increased by about 45% and 33% respect-
ively. The cost of this 1980-1985 development program has been estimated by
DCH at about CFAF 50 billion (US$185 million) in current prices, of which the
village well sector investments amount to CFAF 22.3 billion (US$83 million).
Previous Bank Lending
1.19      The Bank has made one loan for the secondary centers water supply
systems (Loan 1484--signed 9/77 for US$16 million), and two loans for the
Abidjan Sewerage and Drainage System (Loan 1076--signed 1/75, and Loan 1577
--signed 5/79, for US$9 million and US$33 million respectively).
Performance in both sectors has been satisfactory.
1.20      Under Loan 1484, the 15 secondary centers water supply systems
which were identified in the appraisal report and amount to about two-thirds
of the project, were put into operation in early 1980. The identification of
two priority centers for the non-assigned part of the loan was initially
delayed due to DCH's original reluctance to comply with the selection process
required by the Bank, as well as understaffing problems in DCH. The water
supply systems for these centers are under construction and are expected to be
completed by mid 1982.
1.21      The First Abidjan Sewerage Project was satisfactorily completed and
the loan closed on June 30, 1979. Construction of the first phase of the
second Abidjan Sewerage project started in January 1980 and was 90%
completed by end 1981. Construction of the second phase of the project
started in mid 1981 and progress is good. The house connection program is
behind schedule due to bureaucratic delays originating from SETU.
Manpower and Training
1.22      The private and public Civil Works sector in the Ivory Coast is
heavily dependent on expatriate technicians and managers. This is particu-
larly true in the technical departments of the Ministry of Works, as Govern-
ment salaries are not competitive with the private sector. At the source of
the scarcity of Ivorian civil works technicians and engineers is the small
capacity of the public works school. Recently a new public works school has
been built in Yamoussoukro with a capacity of 1,400 students and the situation
should start gradually improving from 1983 onwards.



-6-
1.23      SODECI has been successful in training personnel for the water
supply sector. It has its own training center and as a private enterprise can
hire, discipline and fire its personnel. This is one of the main factors in
the success of the Ivory Coast water supply sector. As a Government depart-
ment, DCH has hardly been able to attract any Ivorian engineers or technicians;
only a few Ivorian ground water specialists are being trained in DCH for tlhe
village well sector. The proposed project provides for financing of training
courses, on the job technical training and post graduate training for tech-
nical staff to be recruited from the public works school for DCH, and for
accountants for FNH.
II - POPULATION, SERVICES AND DEMAND
Population Forecasts
Abidjan
2.01      During the last decade, Abidjan has been one of the fastest growing
metropolitan cities in Africa, averaging an annual population growth rate
of about 10%. There is almost an over-proliferation of published population
estimates and projections, which, unfortunately, do not necessarily concur
with each other. This is understandable, given the nature and circumstances
of growth for Abidjan. The last census was held in 1975 and a population
count was carried out by the Central Directorate for Urbanism (DCU) in 1979
in preparation for the elections the following year.
2.02      In between, the government launched, with assistance of the World
Bank Urban Projects Department a major effort to project Abidjan-s population
growth, economic and residential evolution over the next decade (1980s) with
the aim of arriving at alternative development strategies and attaching a
price tag to each of these. This exercise resulted in the Master Plan titled
Perspective Decennale d'Abidjan (PDA), published in 1978/79. While this
document has never been officially retained as representing the Government
Projections, its thoroughness of analysis, or rather, abundance of detailed
information on the present situation, has elevated it to the status of a
central document.
2.03      Further, there are the projections from the Statistical Directorate
of the Ministry of Plan and Economic Development which issues its own set
of figures (projections) in parallel to the preparation of the 5-year plans.
2.04      The Water Master Plan prepared by the Consultauts,$CET/BETURE, is
based on PDA's projections. These have also been retained by the appraisal
mission as far as concerns the overall figures, but revised in the detailed
assumptions by residential zones and housing categories to take account of the
latest developments; e.g. where reality has already overtaken projected
figures; or where recently adopted Government decisions will have an obvious
impact on the urban growth pattern.

2.05      The resulting population projections are illustrated below:

Growth rates
(annual):
Abidjan               9.6%    10.4%      9.7%    7.7%    7.4%
2.06      The projected decline in population growth over the next decade
is explained by a combination of various factors: a natural tendency towards
stabilization of the population, particularly in the core zones of the city
due to saturation of available space; government policies to stop the exodus
from the interior of the country; and through accelerated public investments
in the zones outside of Abidjan (to which this project plans to contribute
through investment in secondary centers). For the mid-term, one can say that
the projection for 1985 could be, if anything, on the conservative side, given
the built-in inertia of the rate of population growth, particularly with
regard to immigration from other African countries.
Residential Patterns in Abidjan
2.07      The evolution of the habitat has been analysed with reference to
geographical (zonal) distribution and income-related housing categories.
While the central parts of Abidjan, notably Plateau, Treichville, and Adjame,
have come close to reaching their saturation point (at densities between 300
or 400 persons/ha), it appears, and most recent data (DCU figures from 79/80)
confirm this, that these areas will nonetheless continue to grow, at least
over the next years. In contrast with this continuous growth along the
North-South axis, the densification of the East-West axis, appears to have
progressed at a somewhat lower rate than expected. Without doubt caused by
constraints posed by traffic/transportation problems due to the intersecting
lagoons, a situation which is unlikely to be drastically altered within the
projected time horizon of 5 years.
2.08      As to the housing classification, enough information was obtained
to arrive at a forecast of what type of residential development would occur
in the next years, and thus, how the population would be distributed by 1985
according to housing category. Details can be seen in the Project File.
The Interior Centers
2.09      The project would cover water system extensions in 52 interior
centers located within 8 SODECI Administrative regions (see Annex 3.2).
All centers are principal townships of either prefectures or subprefec-
tures. Population forecasts were prepared by the Consultants BELLER/SCET-
BETURE retained urnder the first Sewerage Project and appear reasonable.



-8-
The census figures of 1975 and population projections prepared by DDR _/ in
1977/79 served as principal inputs for projections for the time horizon of
1990.
2.10      The table below contains the population projections adopted for the
project centers:

2.11      The centers mostly exclude the capital cities of the respective
regions, where higher growth rates are being observed (e.g. Bouake, Daloa,
Cagnoa, Korhogo). Hence, with the exception of the Gagnoa Region (due to
inclusion of San Pedro, the second port of the Ivory Coast) and Yamoussoukro
Region (due to its central location and relative political influence) the
projected growth rates are somewhat lower than the country-wide growth rates
for the urban interior. Notable also are the slower growth rates of the
northern and north-western regions (Korhogo and Man).
Water Supply Conditions and Demand
Existing Facilities and Levels of Service (Abidjan)
2.12      The fast growing city of Abidjan depends for its water needs on a
vast aquifer below the city and its extensions. The groundwater is of high
quality with a low pH (around 5). It is estimated that the aquifer has a safe
yield of around 700,000 m3/day, and that it could cope with future demand at
least through the end of the century. Beyond that, more expensive surface
water resources would have to be exploited. The water supply system presently
consists of zones of production with a total capacity of about 210,000 m3/day
(2.6 m3/s). While the system can still cope comfortably with average daily
demand, its production and transmission capacity does not allow for further
growth of peak seasonal demand.
2.13      The total length of the existing distribution network is estimated
at some 1,100 km. The system is well maintained and operated, unaccounted-
for water (system losses) being around 18%. The quality of water produced
is very high. The facilities have been extended to keep the Abidjan system
updated to meet the increasing demand of a fast growing population.
1/   Rural Development Directorate.



2.14      By end 1980, some 75,600 connections, all metered, were installed,
of which about 96% were estimated to be domestic. Approximately 870,000
persons (57% of the population) are directly connected to the system, with an
average per capita consumption of 91 lcd (inclusive of industrial and other
consumption). Of a total daily consumption of 139,000 m3 about 2/3 has been
residential, with the rest going to industrial, commercial, and other large
consumers.
2.15      The remainder of Abidjan's population is served by a combination
of private water vendors, collected rainwater, and - in the low-lying areas,
i.e., Treichville, Marcory, Koumassi - compound wells. In comparison with
other African metropolitan cities, there is practically no organized supply
through public standpipes (only about 30 are operating at bus stands, markets,
and outlying settlements). Instead, the system of professional water vendors
is widespread, as is also the custom of letting unsupplied neighbours use
one's tap for a fee. This may be one of the trade-offs between having on one
hand an efficient, and cost-conscious private sector organization providing
reliable water services, and on the other hand acknowledging that such an
organization could hardly be induced to provide free service, with dubious
prospects of reimbursement by, for example, the municipalities.
Future Water Consumption
2.16      Projections of future water consumption and required production are
shown in Annex 2-1. The table below summarizes the results:
1980          1985           1990

Average Daily Consumption (1000 m3)       139           207            308
Per Capita Consumption (lcd)               91            94             98
Connection Rate                            57%           59%            63%
No. of Persons Connected             870,000      1,303,000      1,985,000
No. of Connections                    75,600        113,000        166,000
These projections, particularly for 1990, are by nature somewhat speculative.
As more than half of the population live in traditional African-style com-
pounds, the average consumption rates include sales to those not directly
connected to the water supply system. The share of consumption by habitat
strata is projected to remain stable for the medium term (1985), and it is
expected that with further promotion encouraging universal house connections,
the number of connected population living in traditional compounds will
increase by 1990. While making water available for an additional 430,000
people by 1985, overall, the domestic consumption is expected to increase
by 8.5% p.a., and industrial and commercial consumption would increase by
around 8% p.a.

Interior Centers
Existing Facilities and Levels of Service
2.17      The 52 centers targeted for the project all have quite substantial
water production and treatment facilities, ranging from full treatment to
simple chlorination only, depending on the sources tapped. Most of the
centers have considerable excess capacity in production; the load factor iLn
all project centers in 1980 was just about 39%. Many of the small centers'
facilities were installed a few years ago, and are in good condition. The
connection ratio throughout the centers is only about 29% or 250,200 persons
out of 870,000 by year end 1980. As a necessary investment in order to make
full use of installed production facilities, the extension of the distribution
network is expected to go a long way to overcome existing constraints.
Because of lower population densities as compared to Abidjan, the investment
per capita in distribution networks tends to be quite expensive, a reflection
of the required additional length of distribution mains per inhabitant (par-
ticularly in the Northern Regions). Overall average consumption for 1980 is
at 23 lpcd. Details of existing production facilities and service levels by
region (project centers only) are in Annex 3.2.
Future Water Consumption
2.18      Details of future water consumption projections in the project
centers aggregated by regions are in Annex 2.2. The table below summarizes
the evolution of daily per capita consumption:

2.19      This may appear to reflect only modest increases in availability of
per capita water supply; however, one has to keep in mind the parallel popula-
tion growth. Furthermore, the percentage of population connected would
increase from 29% in January 1981 to 33% by 1985, resulting in about 135,700
additional persons being directly served. The true number of additional
persons indirectly served is impossible to estimate, as through the system of



- 11 -
water vendors, the number of persons benefitting from one connection could be
well over 25. In terms of total amounts of water consumed per year, the
average annual growth rates are substantial with 10% for the period 1980-85
and 7.5% for 1985-90.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
3.01      The overall objectives of the project are to develop the Ivorian
Water Supply sector, so as to provide improved service under present financial
and managerial constraints. This translates into the following:
(a) To optimise the present investments by providing marginal additions
particularly for the Abidjan system, which is the main revenue-earner
of the sector;
(b) To promote greater utilization of the existing systems by providing
consumer connections;
(c) To assist the rational development of the village well subsector;
(d) To assist DCH and FNH in upgrading their technical and financial
management with the help of technical assistance; and
(e) To improve the water supply sector institutions and their management
in general and to explore further ways of long-term streamlining
of the sector organization.
Scope of the Project
3.02      The project will comprise the major part of the Government water
supply investment program for improvement of the existing systems, for the
period 1982-85. The CCCE 1/ of France has indicted interest in financing the
remaining part of this investment program. In addition the project will
include a small village well element and an institution building component
for the Cadastre and Property Tax administration.
Project Description
3.03      The principal elements of the Abidjan subproject are illustrated
on Map IBRD 15774, while the location of the other project systems is in-
dicated on Map IBRD 15773. The major project components, the physical works
of which will be implemented in two phases, and whose detailed descriptions
are presented in Annex 3-1 and 3-2, are as follows:

The estimated total cost of the project is US$57.3 million equivalent based
on mid 1981 prices including allowance for inflation until project completion.
Foreign exchange cost would amount to US$43.0 million or 75% of the total
expenditures based on consultants' estimates of direct and indirect foreign
exchange components of each relevant category. The cost estimates are based
on preliminary designs and unit costs of similar works now under construction,
adjusted to price levels for mid 1981. Final design and construction super-
vision are estimated at 10% of the construction cost. The average cost of
consultants' services and technical assistance (including salary, social
charges and international travel, local allowances and company overhead) is
estimated according to the official Ivorian fee scale of about US$11,000
per man-month. A 13% allowance for physical contingencies was added to the
base costs. Price contingencies were based on a construction profile of four
years starting in 1983 with an annual inflation rate of 12%. These inflation
rates are based on the last 10 years' experiences of inflation trends in the
Ivory Coast as recorded by the Government's contract recording office. There
has been a temporary reduction in the construction and equipment inflation
rate during 1980-81, but the present underlying inflation rates in the Ivory
Coast as well as the increasing energy prices suggest that a trend of 12%
inflation might be adequate-. Water supply sector investments in general,
and therefore the project, are free of import duties and other taxes.
Proposed Loan and Borrower
3.05      A Bank loan to the Government of the Ivory Coast of US$43 million
is proposed which would cover the estimated foreign exchange component of
the project. The loan would be for 17 years including 4 years of grace. The
government would on-lend the proceeds of the Bank loan to FNH on the same
terms as the Bank loan. CEAO 1/ and the Government are discussing possible
participation of CEAO in the financing of the village well component. While
the proposed Bank loan would be made to the Government, the CEAO has offered
to enter into bilateral arrangement with the Government to pay to the Govern-
ment the debt service on the village well component. Since the Government's
policy is to finance all capital expenditure for the sector predominantly
from loans, it is a condition of effectiveness that arrangements for Govern-
ment loans to finance the local cost component of the project are completed
for US$8.5 million, representing the amount necessary for the first three
years of project implementation. Execution of other works outside the project
would depend on the securing of additional loans, but this is not critical to
the project which can stand alone (para. 5.16).
Project Preparation
3.06      Final design for the first phase was completed by February, 1982.
The project is part of a relatively homogeneous investment program and the
first phase is a two-year slice. Design standards, construction procedures,
and reliable cost data were reviewed at the time of appraisal and are satis-
factory.

Implementation
3.07      DCH will be responsible for carrying out the project, assisted
by consultants. During negotiations assurances were obtained that consuL-
tants satisfactory to the Bank would: (i) prepare in consultation with DCH
and SODECI the detailed engineering and supervise the construction of the
entire project except for the village well component, which will be supervised
by DCH with assistance of consultants; and (ii) on the basis of terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank execute the sector studies. Project imple-
mentation is expected to commence in early 1983 and to be completed by end
1986. Details of the project implementation appear in chart 3-1.
Procurement
3.08      The construction of the civil works and the supply of the materials
and equipment, totalling US$41 million including contingencies, would be
procured by ICB in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Small contracts
for purchase of plant, equipment, and vehicles estimated to cost less than
US$100,000 each and contracts for civil works estimated to cost less than
US$200,000 each, totalling US$2 million in aggregate, would be procured on the
basis of local competitive procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Contracts for
the construction of the social-connections, estimated to cost an aggregate of
US$4 million, will be executed by SODECI in view of the scattered nature in
time and place. These contracts will be negotiated with SODECI on an annual
basis and executed by force account. All contracts under ICB would be sub-
ject to the Bank's prior review of procurement documentation. Technical
assistance, consulting and training services will be engaged in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (August 1981).
Loan Disbursement
3.09      Loan proceeds would be disbursed so as to reflect the estimated
foreign exchange component of the project, as follows:
Estimated Amount
(US$ million)
(a) 100% of the foreign exchange cost for direct import
or 80% of the total cost of locally purchased
imported or partly imported goods;
i)   DCH and FNH                                              9.6
ii)   Land register                                              .7
(b)  70% of the total cost of civil works;                         17.4
(c)  90% of the total cost of consultants and training.
i)   DCH and FNH                                              6.1
ii)   Land register                                             1.9
(d)  Unallocated.                                                   7.3

3.10      The closing date would be March 31, 1988. The disbursement profile
has been based on the experience with the first two Bank financed water supply
and sewerage projects in the Ivory Coast, executed during 1975-81. However,
because of the advanced state of procurement, we expect disbursements to be
speedier during the early years. Table 3.2 shows estimated quarterly dis-
bursements.
IV. IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
Organization
4.01      The borrower of the proposed loan would be the Government, which
would undertake to make the proceeds available to FNH through Caisse Autonome
d-Amortissement (CAA), the national debt office. The executing agency would
be DCH, and when constructed, the works would be operated and maintained by
SODECI.
DCH
4.02      DCH is a specialized unit of the Ministry of Public Works and
Transportation established to plan, organize, and supervise the construction
of water supply facilities including public villagewells, as well as to
oversee their operation and maintenance on behalf of the State. It prepares
master plans, designs works, awards contracts, superintends their execution
and authorizes payment to contractors from the funds administered by FNH
(para. 4.06).
4.03      DCH is a competent engineering organization, but relies heavily,
on expatriate skills; most of its professional staff of about 30 are seconded
under contract from a French consulting firm (though its expatriate director
is now directly employed by the Government). Under Loan 1484-IVC the Govern-
ment undertook to prepare a recruitment and training plan for the gradual
replacement of expatriates; this has proved incapable of fulfillment because
of recruitment difficulties (shortage of Ivorian engineers and uncompetitive
salaries). The project includes funds for post-graduate training for newly-
qualified Ivorians emerging from the Government's new engineering college.
4.04      One of DCH's tasks is the supervision of the private-sector company,
SODECI, on behalf of the Government; inter alia, this requires DCH to monitor
financial and accounting matters such as operating costs; the levy of
water rates; and their apportionment among the several agencies entitled
thereto (see Chapter VI). DCH also requires financial expertise to deal with
tariff reviews and the financial administration of contracts; and to streng-
then these functions, the Government agreed under Loan 1484-IVC to recru:Lt an
additional financial expert. This expert has not wholly met the expectations,
and, with the assistance of the Bank, revised terms of reference have been
drawn up for this post, including establishment of a fixed assets register
(para 5.11) and eventually of a consolidated set of accounts for the whole
sector, to assist in policy decision-making. It is recommended that 90%
of the cost of the expert for DCH now being recruited be financed under the
proposed loan, for a period of three years. DCH is subject to the normal
financial controls of Government departments, but at the Bank's request, FNH's
auditors have undertaken the verification of pipe stocks financed by FNH.

FNH
4.05      FNH, the National Water Fund, which administers capital finance
and debt service for the water supply sector, is an autonomous legal entity
created in January 1976 and linked to the Ministry of Finance, Economy, and
Planning. FNH has its own Board, comprising representatives of Ministries and
Government bodies, which approved DCH's investment programs and authorized the
raising of loans, subject to a right of veto by the Minister of Finance.
However, it is understood that FNH's constitution may be subject to revision
under a recent review of para-statal bodies and the future status of
its management needs to be clarified; under Loan 1484-IVC, no material modifi-
cation would be permissible without Bank approval and this matter is being
followed up.
4.06      FNH's management and staff provided by CAA, which also handles
certain transactions (foreign currency and multi-purpose loans) on the E'und's
behalf. 1/ CAA and FNH raise loans, pay contractors on advices from DCH and
service debt out of a special surcharge on water bills, earmarked for this
purpose (para 5.02). About a dozen people work fulltime for the two Funds;
recruitment by CAA of an expatriate expert partly financed under Loan 1484-IVC
to assist FNH and FNA, and the computerization of CAA's records have helped to
overcome previous accounting shortcomings of the Funds, but there are still
signs of understaffing and the continuing increase in the workload will call
for additional qualified staff in 1981 and 1982, to be recruited locally. It
is recommended that the Bank-s partial financing in respect of this expaLtriate
expert for FNH/FNA be extended for a further three years under the proposed
loan; it is most desirable that this technical assistance should continue to
be available to FNH/FNA.
4.07      FNH-s accounts are competently kept, though subject to delays when
transactions in foreign currency have first to be processed by CAA. Undler
Loan 1484-IVC, FNH agreed to have its accounts independently audited every
year and this is being satisfactorily done; the covenant is repeated for the
proposed loan. However, the requirement to submit the audit report to the
Bank within four months of the year-end has proved impracticable because!
the accounts themselves require three to four months to complete; it was
agreed to extend the time-limit to nine months.
SODECI
4.08      Operation and maintenance of all water supply systems as well
as sewerage and drainage systems in Ivory Coast are the responsibility of
SODECI under a series of agency agreements:  a "concession" contract for
Abidjan, under which the company still has some responsibility for minor
capital works, a management contract for other urban systems and for main-
tenance of village wells--both contracts being with the Government--and an
operation and maintenance contract for sewerage and drainage, as agent for
SETU (para. 1.05). The two water supply agreements run through 1989 and have
provisions for extensions.
1/   Both funds (FNH and FNA) have the same management and staff.



- 21 -
4.09      SODECI is a private company, owned approximately 48% by French
interests (predominantly represented by a water supply company, SAUR 1/) and
52% by Ivorian stockholders, including a small (4%) holding by SONAFI 2/, a
Government finance corporation. In turn, SODECI has part-interests in a real
estate corporation, a meter assembly company, a bottling plant and a civil
engineering company; SODECI itself has a construction department which
provided 40% of the company's turnover in FY1979. Regular dividends are paid
(15% in recent years) and there have been substantial stock dividends--SODECI's
capital has increased 40-fold since 1968. Its shares are quoted on the
Abidjan Stock Exchange.
4.10      SODECI is efficiently managed and provides first class service to
its consumers; water quality and pressure are uniformly good, and unaccounted-
for water is kept down to less than 20%, which is very satisfactory.
4.11      Total staff of the company numbered 1,534 in September 1980.  Though
the General Manager, and all provincial water supply managers are Ivorians,
SODECI still depends heavily on expatriates: however, the non-African element
among senior staff is now declining, as can be seen from the following table:
Table 4-1: SODECI STAFF
Year                     1977      1978      1979     1980
A.  Total staff                 955     1193      1431      1534
B.  Senior Posts                159      196       231       245

C as % of B                21%       22%       18%      15%
The increase in total staff is attributable to the number of provincial
water systems taken over by SODECI in recent years and to the increased
turnover on civil works contracts (which more than doubled between 1977 and
1979) and sewer maintenance.
4.12      SODECI has its own training center and, as a private enterprise,
has more flexibility than the Government in dealing with its personnel (para.
1.23); these two factors have contributed considerably to the success of
SODECI and the water supply sector generally in Ivory Coast.
4.13      For its water supply activities, SODECI is remunerated by a separate
component of the water tariff (which comprises several elements (para 5.02)).
This is calculated on agreed standards or "norms" for staffing levels and for
the required amounts of equipment, power, chemicals, etc. for each stage of
development of SODECI's system; these norms are costed, together with a margin
representing agreed overheads and profit, resulting in a rate per m3 of water
sold, subject to revision annually on a price index formula.

- 22 -
4.14      All consumption is charged by meter, and billing is continuous on
a quarterly basis, bills being delivered by hand. Accounting of billing is
computerized and executed promptly and efficiently, though initially there
were computer delays. SODECI follows up quickly on unpaid accounts using
every available means to enforce payment, including cutting off delinquent
consumers and requiring new applicants for supply to settle any unpaid bills
of the former consumers. Nevertheless, collection is slow and difficult and
total arrears are usually equivalent to about six months' revenue (para 5.15).
4.15      As well as an internal audit section, SODECI has independent external
auditors who carry out a satisfactory annual audit in accordance with a cove-
nant under Loan 1484-IVC. As in the case of FNH (para 4.07) those assurances
are repeated under this project, and similarly the time-limit for submission
of audit reports extended to nine months after the fiscal year end.
4.16      Although a private company, SODECI is a collector of revenues, not
only for itself, but for FNH and FNA, both Government agencies. Accordingly,
there should be some measure of Government supervision of SODECI and this has
hitherto been carried out by DCH, but such supervision has tended to be nom-
inal and superficial. This-should improve with the advent of the financial
expert in DCH but something more is still desirable by way of detailed certifi-
cation of certain matters, and for this SODECI's auditors should be responsible.
Assurances were therefore obtained that the Government will request SODECI to
submit each year:
(i)  Statement of its auditors that the amounts billed and collectted on
behalf of FNH and FNA, respectively, (including levies on private
groundwater abstraction), in their opinion and to the best of their
knowledge, accurately reflect the meter-readings registered arnd the
correct tariff categories.
(ii)  An opinion of its auditors on the accuracy of SODECI's costing
system and the appropriateness of the allocation of overhead charges
to SODECI's different activities.
Cadastre and Property Tax Assessment
4.17      Although the Cadastre in the Ivory Coast is among the best in
Africa, it is acknowledged that it does not have the manpower and computer
equipment to keep up with Abidjan's urban development and the rapid expansion
of its services to other cities in the Ivory Coast. For example three lto
five year delays have occurred for the newly developed areas of the Banco and
Abobo of Greater Abidjan. It is also understood that property values are not
re-assessed regularly to keep up with rising market values and inflation.
Also the local banks cannot develop the property mortgage market due to lack
of owner documentation.
4.18      Following a Bank consultant's study financed under the Second
Abidjan and Drainage project a program was developed by the Government to
modernize and bring up to date the Cadastre and the property tax administra-
tion. Two technical assistants were recruited under the same project to
prepare for the introduction of modern computer equipment. This loan will
provide US$3 million for technical assistance and consultant services of land
surveyors.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Sector Financing Strategy
5.01      As part of its plan to accelerate the development of the water
sector, the Government reallocated sector responsibilities in the early 1970s
(para 1.04) and formulated a new financing strategy, aimed at making the
sector financially self-supporting. It comprised the following:
(i)  Financing fixed assets largely from loan and centralizing the
administration of debt and capital finance under FNH;
(ii)  Servicing debt entirely with a surcharge added to the water rate
to cover this expense, and devoting the basic water rate entirely
to operation and maintenance (including depreciation of the minor
assets which are SODECI's own property);
(iii) Establishment of a uniform nationwide tariff, to bring down
the high rates charged for supplies in the interior.
Water Tariff--Past Trends
5.02      The water tariff in the Ivory Coast comprises three components, each
separately calculated in CFAF/m3 and earmarked for a different agency: the
basic rate, calculated to cover SODECI's costs of operation and maintenance
(para 4.13) and two surcharges--one for sewerage on behalf of FNA, and one for
water, accruing to FNH and calculated to cover debt service and FNH's operat-
ing costs. SODECI bills and collects on behalf of all three bodies, remitting
surcharge collections as received to the two Funds. Minor surcharges formerly
levied in aid of municipalities and health education were abandoned as from
1979/80.
5.03      The composite tariff with separate components calculated to meet
various needs, besides confirming the strong Government commitment to sector
self-financing, ensures that maintenance standards are not sacrificed to
provide funds for debt service; conversely, the surcharge to cover debt
service (and not merely depreciation) should ensure sufficient cash flow for
this purpose. Furthermore, the causes of tariff increases are easier to
identify and hence justify. The enterprise-minded operating company can con-
centrate on commercial and operational aspects, free of capital financing
preoccupations, while the separate tariff component for its services permits a
clearer focus on the level of its remuneration, as an aid to correct pricing.
5.04      The full tariff is uniform in all areas of the Ivory Coast which
have a piped water supply, even though unit costs of supplying water are
widely disparate (two to three times as high in the interior as in Abidjan
with its low-cost groundwater resources). On the other hand, only Abidjan has
a proper sewer system. 1/ Consultants estimated in 1979 that the uniform
tariff represented a net "subsidy" from Abidjan consumers to other consumers
of about CFAF 42/m3 (out of the then average tariff of CFAF 149/m3).
Similarly, urban consumers subsidize village water supplies--until 1981, these
supplies were free, though a system of maintenance contributions by villages
has now been established.
1/   The tariff partially reflects these disparities, in that provincial
consumers pay only a small sewer surcharge (representing the cost of
studies etc), but their water surcharge is correspondingly higher, to
keep the total tariff at the same level nationwide.



-24 -
5.05      Within the uniform tariff, there are however distinctions between
consumer classes. A "social tariff" for the first 10 m3 per month benefits
small consumers, the rate being only about 57% of the full rate (CFAF 128 m3
instead of CFAF 224/m3)--achieved by deleting the sewer surcharge and most
of the water surcharge from that part of the tariff. Small consumers may also
be entitled to exemption from connection charges. There are reduced rates for
large industrial consumers (though this concession is being eliminated by
three annual stages) and for public supplies, including public standpipes--
paid for by municipalities, the water being free to the consumer. This tariff
structure is felt to be reasonable and appropriate.
5.06      Tariff revisions in practice are usually approved at the highest
level of Government, in view of their impact on the cost of living. Up to
1978, tariffs were reviewed annually, but the next revision took place only as
from FY1979/80. The present tariff applies for the year commencing October 1,
1980, but since it was approved only in February 1981, the retroactive part of
the increase will be difficult to recover. The following table sets out
successive tariff levels over the period 1976-1981, indicating first the
average level of each tariff component (weighted average of the different
consumer-class rates and of the differing regional composition of the tariff);
followed by the total full rate paid by normal domestic/commercial consumers,
and the "social tariff."

a/   After June 1, 1981, SODECI's rate is reduced by CFAF 6.75/m3 (and the
water surcharge correspondingly increased) to reflect cost of village
well maintenance which SODECI is henceforth to collect direct from rural
communities.
5.07      The full rate has thus increased by about 13.5% a year on average since
1976--slightly more than the rate of inflation in the Ivory Coast. The "social
tariff", by contrast, has increased only by about 10% annually; but the average
tariff 1/ is now equivalent to about US$0.76/m3. This high level is due to
1/   All consumers benefit from the "social tariff" for the first 10 m3, so that
a domestic consumer will tend to pay the "average rate" for his total
consumption.

(a) the burden of debt service over short periods (which should gradually ease
in the long term) ; (b) the cost of subsidizing village water supplies at the
urban consumer's expense; and (c) to some degree, the price paid for high
efficiency in the use of expatriate experts in the sector. SODECI's profit on
water is relatively modest and its basic water rate is subject to close
scrutiny by the Government at each review.
Past and Present Financial Performance
FNH
5.08      The water surcharge is intended to be fixed annually to cover
estimated debt service for the sector, plus FNH's operating costs, after
allowing for miscellaneous revenues and any accumulated surplus from past
levies of the surcharge. In the early years after establishment of FNH, the
surcharge level was deliberately fixed higher than necessary to build up a
revenue surplus, but this surplus has tended to diminish in recent years.
5.09      Salient features of FNH's recent accounts are suwmarized below:

a/   Excluding capital grants which are treated by FNH as income (but an
equal amount is charged as amortization of the assets so financed).
The increased other income in 1980 reflects the first debt service
subsidy (CFAF 1939 million, para. 5.12).
b/   FNH also has in hand from time to time large sums of undisbursed loans
which it is obliged to withdraw in full under the loan agreements
concerned. Total cash balances can be seen in Annex 5-1.



- 26 -
5.10      FNH's accounts are kept on the normal accruals basis with some
modifications. For example, the water surcharge is brought into account, not
on the usual basis of billings, but only as collected by SODECI. This con-
servative approach is justified by the high level of outstanding arrears of
water rates (para. 5.15). In the same prudent way, periodical revisions of
the surcharge are calculated on forecast collection patterns, not on estimates
of billed consumption. However, the recent tariff increase took some time to
win approval, with a consequent loss of planned revenue, and it is possible
that FNH's accumulated revenue surplus may completely disappear by end-1982.
Annex 5-1 shows details of FNH's past and projected finances.
5.11      Another departure in FNH's accounts is that fixed assets appear in
the balance sheet only to the extent that debt is outstanding thereon (reval-
ued to reflect exchange rate changes), so that the amount shown bears no
relation to the true value of assets in service. To overcome this, a fixed
assets register was proposed under Loan 1484-IVC; though an inventory was
made, responsible officials have never been able to develop this into an
updated and revalued record. However, steps are being taken (para 4.04) to
remedy this deficiency. One consequence of the failure to create the register
is that it has never been possible to monitor the rate of return covenant
under Loan 1484-IVC (para. 5.21). Assurances were obtained that effective
January 1, 1983, DCH will have established, and will thereafter maintain, an
appropriately revalued capital assets register and global sector accounts, in
accordance with recommendations of the proposed sector study.
5.12      The policy of 100% debt financing of fixed assets, while it may
be unavoidable in the case where a previously underdeveloped sector launches a
major development program, avoiding dependence on the state budget for funds,
may impose a heavy burden on consumers if undue recourse is had to short-term
loans; and under Loan 1484-IVC, FNH was required to reduce the proportion of
such loans (under 7 years) from 15% to 5%. The proportion had by 1979 fallen
to 2.5% and it is unlikely that it will again become significant in the
foreseeable future. In the event, 100% debt financing has not proved necessary;
during 1977-80, about 13% of capital expenditure was met from grants (from the
Government's Special Investment Budget, the Price Stabilization Fund, and the
National Lottery). Loans raised have sometimes been on terms which FNH has
subsequently felt to be onerous, and in lieu of consenting to refinancing on
easier terms, the Government has awarded a subsidy equal to the probable
saving: it is also reimbursing FNH for the debt service on a dam which serves
purposes other than water supply.
SODECI
5.13      From its overall operations, SODECI has contrived to make regular
profits each year, as evidenced in the summary table below; Annex 5-2 shows
fuller details of SODECI-s recent finances.

5.14      Ascertainment of the profit margin on water supply alone entails
apportionment of the substantial overheads common to all activities, which
is unavoidably somewhat arbitrary. SODECI's costing system has produced
the following breakdown (profit expressed as a percentage of operating charges
including overhead)-which demonstrates how markedly the uniform tariff
transfers resources from Abidjan to the provinces.

5.15      Though SODECI normally operates on a small or even overdrawn bank
balance, this has not handicapped its operations in the past, and up to
December 1980, cash collections of water surcharge had been handed over to FNH
with increasing promptness. One persistent cash flow problem stems, however,
from the high level of consumer arrears which at all times represent about six
months- revenues; about one-third of the arrears are due from Government
agencies where payment procedures appear to be extremely slow, but more
realistic budgeting for water charges has recently been introduced, which
should improve the situation.
5.16      The economic recession in 1980/81 found SODECI in a vulnerable
position, having committed itself to heavy costs in respect of new offices
and the new training center; its civil engineering activity has diminished



- 28 -
sharply, and if it is to maintain its profit record, it will have to pay close
attention to budgetary control and retrenchment, since it cannot count on a
higher share in real terms of the water tariff--though the formula for this
has been reviewed in late 1981. SODECI s net cash position has now deterio-
rated for three years running; and one recent symptom of the financial sitrin-
gency has been a falling-off in the prompt remittance of surcharge revenues to
FNH (three months behind as of March 1981). Meanwhile since 1980 SODECI has
made good progress in the collection of arrears and we expect their cash
position to improve gradually.
Financing Plan
5.17      The total cost of the 1981-85 investment program is estimated at
about CFAF 52 billion (US$193 million), exclusive of residual expenditures
under the previous program. Full implementation of this program will depend
on available financing, but this is not critical since much of the program
consists of relatively small components which are not inter-related and can be
postponed without affecting the remainder of the program. Although substantial
capital grants have been contributed in the past, this source cannot be relied
upon in future and all capital expenditure after 1981 has been assumed to be
debt-financed. The table below shows first the forecast annual distribution
of expenditure and then the estimated financing sources; it does not include
operating and maintenance costs of SODECI or administrative costs of DCBH,
financed respectively from the basic water rate and from the Government
budget. Though DCH administers the investment program, it does not in fact
handle any of the sector funds.

5.18      Of a total of CFAF 52 billion of borrowings, only about CFAF 2L
billion has been identified, including the proposed Bank loan, leaving about
CFAF 31 billion still to be arranged. This may prove difficult in the present
financial climate, though not critical (para 5.16); nevertheless, the source
of the counterpart funds for the Bank project, at least, will be identified
before loan effectiveness (para 3.05 ). Assurance was also obtained that
the Government would fund any cost overruns on the proposed project.
Future Financial Performance
5.19      Annex  5-1 shows FNH's past and projected Income Statements, Funds
Flow Statements and Balance Sheets, and Annex 5-3 tabulates the forecast water
sales, average surcharge levels, and collections (using a recovery pattern
based on past experience). The impact of the program and its resulting debt
service on FNH's finances is estimated to require an average annual increase
of 18% in the water surcharge (6% in real terms) through 1984/85; after that,
it is anticipated that no further increase would be needed through 1987/88,
though this forecast is based on somewhat tentative estimates of capital
expenditure after 1985. Annex 5-3 also lists the assumptions for projections.
5.20      After 1981 in which FNH's accumulated revenue surplus looks like
almost disappearing (partly because of the delay in approving the latest
tariff increase), the position would, on projections, be progressively restored
thereafter. The projections assume that FNH continues to be reimbursed by the
Government for certain unremunerative debt service (para 5.12) and assurances
were sought In this respect. Salient features of FNH-s future finances
were shown in Table 5-6 below, using selected fiscal years:

5.21      As regards the other two components of the water tariff, the basic
water rate accruing to SODECI is forecast to rise in step with inflation
(estimated at 12% annually), since a price-index formula is used for each
annual revision. Detailed cost projections made in the tariff study (1979)
forecast a slowly declining rate (in real terms) for SODECI's needs 1980-90;
however, this was based on slightly more optimistic demand projections than
those now adopted, and it is felt to be more appropriate in the present
context to assume a basic rate which is constant in rPeal terms. The tariff
study is in the Project File. The sewerage surcharge is expected to remain
at its present level until late 1982 and is then assumed to increase at 12% a
year, though this will of course depend on the dimensions of the next stage of
sewer construction. On this basis, the total tariff would rise to CFAF
423/m3 by 1987/88, representing an average annual increase of 11%, as shown
in the table below; this is lower than the anticipated inflation rate, but in
individual years the tariff hike could be as high as 16%-17%.

Financial Covenants
5.22   The first water supply project (Loan 1484-IVC) contained a tariff
covenant, in respect of the water surcharge component only, in terms of a
rate of return. This provided broadly that the revenues from the surcharge
(i.e. amounts billed), after deducting FNH½s own administrative costs, should
cover notional depreciation on the estimated value of net fixed assets in
service, plus a 3% return on that value. While surcharge levels have been
periodically adjusted to cover debt service, it has never been possible to
monitor compliance with this requirement, due to the absence of necessary
record of fixed asset values (para 5.11). Moreover, FNH does not record
"amounts billed" in its accounts, but only collections. (Amounts billed could
of course be extracted from SODECI-s accounts but these would not tally with
FNH's fiscal year.)
5.23      In any case, with hindsight, it is not clear that the rate of return
concept is at this stage appropriate in the Ivory Coast context--much less
appropriate than for a normal all-purpose water authority financing all costs
out of an indivisible tariff. The underlying reasons for ROR covenants are
partly to ensure that the consumer is charged for capital employed, but mainly
to ensure adequate cash generation for expansion. In the Ivory Coast system,
however, there are substantial cross-subsidies between regions, so that cost
recovery tends, anyway, to be blurred exception on the widest overall basis.
More importantly, by definition, there can be no cash generation unless the
surcharge is higher than is needed to cover debt service, and it would be
excessive to require this in the Ivory Coast with almost 100% debt financing
repayable over periods much shorter than asset lives 1/ the resultant surcharge
already bears heavily on consumers, and this burden will become progressively
heavier. Clearly, however, the tariff now charged comprises a positive rate
of return (if it could be calculated--a rough Bank estimate of revalued assets
for 1979 suggested the ROR in that year was about 6%).
1/   FNH-s debt at the end of 1979 had an average original maturity of 6.7
years after 4.6 years of grace, and average interest rate of 6.4%.



- 33 -
5.24    A more appropriate and practical measure of tariff adequacy would
relate the cash proceeds of the surcharge to the debt service requirements
they are intended to cover. At some future date, when the period of peak
debt service for the ongoing major development program is past, and when an
updated record of fixed assets should be available, it may be appropriate to
re-introduce the rate of return concept, rather than reduce the surcharge.
Accordingly, assurances were obtained that:
(i) the Government will promptly adjust the water surcharge annually in
October so that its forecast proceeds collected from consumers in
each calendar year will cover the budgeted net operating costs of
FNH in that year taking into account debt service (other than debt
service reimbursed by the Government), other operating expenses, and
miscellaneous revenues and in addition, after 1981 leave a surplus
on revenue account ("Reserve Speciale", in FNH's terminology) at the
year end, as a contingencies margin, equal to not less than 3% of
the year's debt service until the accumulated surplus has reached
10% of FNH's debt service;
(ii) where it appears for any year that the existing surcharge will be
sufficient to meet the criteria above without revision, the Govern-
ment will consult with the Bank on the introduction of a tariff
policy embodying either a rate of return on net fixed assets in
service or a net cash generation objective in accordance with
any recommendations of the proposed sector study;
and, to complete the pattern of ensuring adequate sector finance:
(iii) the Government will continue to review annually the basic water rate
component of the tariff to cover the cost of operation and mainte-
nance, in accordance with sound public utility practices, of systems
for which SODECI is responsible.
Debt Limitation
5.25      To complement the above-mentioned rate convenant, a test is needed
to ensure that, when a loan is actually incurred by FNH, resources are likely
to be available to meet longer-term debt service (since with many loans, the
real burden of debt service does not begin until some years later, after the
grace period has expired). The debt-limitation test under Loan 1484-IVC
required each year's debt service to be covered by the preceding year's reve-
nues, which, with both debt service and revenues rising by 30%-40% annually,
has proved impracticable and needs modification. Accordingly, assurances were
obtained that the borrower shall not permit any debt to be incurred on FNH's
account unless a reasonable forecast, acceptable to the Bank, of the revenues
and expenditures of FNH shows that the projected internal cash generation for
each fiscal year during the term of the debt to be incurred will be at least
equal to the projected total debt service of FNH for that year not reimbursed
by the Government (para 5.12). For this purpose, "internal cash generation"
would mean FNH's revenues from all sources (excluding capital grants for
works), less operating and administrative expenses.

Overall Sector Finance
5.26      One of the drawbacks of the fragmented sector structure is that
there is no overall picture of the sector's finances, from which conclusions
can be drawn regarding, for example, the degree of cost effectiveness, the
return on capital invested, and the extent of cross-subsidization in the
tariff. Though these are reviewed at intervals in sector studies and tariLff
studies, it is preferable that there should be a systematic overview, and it
should be possible to establish such a system with the creation of global
sector accounts referred to in para 4.04. The sector study proposed will
make recommendations in this direction (para 3.03 and Annex 3-3).
VI. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
Abidjan
6.01      The primary benefits of the proposed project would be the continuous
availability of high quality potable water in sufficient quantity to maintain
the present level of service for a fast growing city. The quantifiable
benefits as expressed by incremental sales would be high enough not only
to achieve cost recovery for the incremental investment in Abidjan, but
also to cross subsidize the higher incremental costs in the interior centers.
6.02      Additional external benefits would also be realized through improve-
ment in water-related sanitation and health environment through Government
sponsored programs parallel to the project.
6.03      The urban poverty groups would be an integral part of project
beneficiaries, as densification programs would also attempt to reach hitherto
unserved or under-served zones.
Interior Centers
6.04      Here the primary benefits would be an improved productivity by
better utilization of already installed systems. The project would enable
more beneficiaries to obtain safe water by extending the distribution network.
The project would also concur with increased Government resolve to revitalize
the interior centers in order to arrive at a more balanced population and
income distribution between Abidjan and the interior over the next decades.
Least Cost Solution
Abidjan
6.05      The project would add incremental investments to an already we:Ll
developed supply system. Dedictated by the design and location of the
existing system and given the limited choice of sources, the least cost



-- 35 -
solution has essentially been determined a priori as the one permitting
further exploitation of the groundwater resources.
6.06      The project would take into account the optimal phasing of invest-
ments. Additional production zones boreholes would be added to provide for the
needs up to 1986/87; by that time further production capacity would have to be
added to meet projected demand up to 1990. The pH adjustment plants, however,
would reach full capacity within 7 to 8 years and it is more cost-effective to
construct them in one phase rather than by stages. Supplementary distribution
network would be added annually to correspond to the pace of demand increases.
Interior Centers
6.07      It has been demonstrated that the proposed extension works, notably
of distribution networks would not be excessive in terms of per capita invest-
ment. In the case of Sinfra, where new production and treatment facilities
would be added in the form of a small dam, the least cost solution would be
determined.
Long Run Marginal Cost and Pricing Considerations
Abidjan
6.08      Marginal cost pricing would normally enable the tariff to fulfill
its role of indicating the economic cost of water and thus provide adequate
signals as to the cost of water wastage. In order to avoid heavy fluctuations
of marginal costs due to lumpy investments over a relatively short period,
the concept of average incremental cost (AIC) 1/ has been adopted as repre-
sentative for the long run marginal cost.
6.09      Concerning the proposed investments in Abidjan, the marginal cost
has been calculated for a time horizon of 15 years, i.e. up to 1995 at an
opportunity cost of 10%. Due to the discounting factor, extension of the
period to 20 or 30 years would not alter the picture significantly. The AIC
thus arrived at for the Abidjan component is CFAF 104/m3.
Interior Centers
6.10      The AIC for the centers has been calculated for the investments and
related incremental recurrent costs for the incremental consumption over the
next 15 years for the time horizon of 1995. This would also coincide with the
estimated design period for the additional distribution network to be provided
under the project. The table below provides the marginal costs (at 10%
discount rate) per region, illustrating the deviations experienced:
1/   AIC expressed as the present value of total incremental investment
and recurrent cost divided by the present value of incremental water
consumed, at a discount rate equalling the opportunity cost of capital.



- 36 -
Region                    AIC (CFAF/m3)
Gagnoa                          260
Daloa                           356
Korhogo                         281
Bouake                         293
Basse-Cote                     284
Abengourou                      260
Yamoussoukro                   247
Man                            255
Total                          271
6.11      One has to bear in mind that these figures, while in fact exceeding
the tariff, still can be considered as relatively low, as the project invest-
ments and the other succeeding ones up until 1995 benefit greatly from the
past investments as sunk costs. Details of AIC calculations appear in the
project file.
Pricing Considerations
6.12      Given the unusual system of multi-component water tariffs, equalised
for the whole of the Ivory Coast, (paras 5.02-5.04), and as debt service
is not distinguished between investments for Abidjan and those for otner
centers, the combined marginal cost per m3 of water consumed of the proposed
project (Abid an and centers) has to be compared with the existing tariff
of CFAF 178/m , net of the sewerage surcharge. The combined AIC being
CFAF 131/m3, the present tariff would provide for a comfortable margin of
36%. As indicated in paras. 5.01-5.07 such a premium is justified by the
financial requirements of the sector.
6.13      The present tariff consists of 52% actual average production and
operating cost per m3 and a small profit margin for SODECI, and 48% water
surcharge as provision for debt service for investment. The amount of this,
is dictated by the actual debt service required at the current time, and is
thus intractable.  This implies that:
(a) the situation merely reflects the fact that as a sector which is
almost entirely dependent on debt financing, the water sector has
had in the past to borrow from commercial sources, with average
maturities (around 11 years) shorter than asset lives (30-35 years
in average);
(b)  debt service by definition is a reflection of past-incurred obliga-
tions, whereas the/AIC deals with costs to be incurred starting now;
and as shown in Chapter V, the water sector faces a period over the
next years when debt service will be at a peak;
(c) the sector had to borrow more in the past in order to build up a
countrywide water supply system from scratch, whereas now the
focus will gradually shift more to extending existing systems
with associated lower incremental costs per m3;.and



- 37 -
(d) the urban water sector also has to carry the debt burden for the
rural water supplies.
6.14      It is of interest to note that the first lOm3 of consumption per
connection (the social tranche) is priced at CFAF 128, coincidentally very
close to the AIC of CFAF 131/m3. Thus, at least, the poverty groups would
not be penalized (although only theoretically, as the prices charged by the
middlemen, e.g. water vendors, are actually much higher--about CFAF 10 for
10 liters or CFAF 1,000/m3).
Internal Rate of Return
6.15      The internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the urban components
of the Project 1/ takes into account, (a) as benefits, revenues associated
with incremental water sales as a result of the project, and (b) as costs, the
capital costs associated with the project and all incremental recurrent costs.
The IERR is 24% with existing tariff levels (assuming constant 1981 prices).
(Annex 6-1).
6.16      The water tariff as a whole is applied to indicate the expressed
willingness of the beneficiaries to pay for water. It thus includes also
the sewerage surcharge, of whose existence many customers are not aware.
Applying only the "net" water tariff, as indicator for cost recovery purposes,
the IERR would still yield 14%.
6.17      The high IERR reflects the combination of a project benefiting
from large sunk costs and well developed existing systems, and a uniquely
structured tariff, which for other reasons is very high (para 5.07).
6.18      Sensitivity analysis on cost variations demonstrate that the project
is relatively insensitive towards changes within the normal testing boun-
daries. Details are to be found in a working paper in the Project file.
Affordability
6.19      In consideration for the poorer segments of society, a social tariff
of CFAF 128/m3 is installed, which applies to all consumers for the first
10 m3/month. The full tariff of CFAF 224/m3 comes into effect only after
full consumption of this block (the average tariff level is CFAF 205/m3).
6.20      These tariffs do not cause problems with regard to affordability
of water services. Even for a family of 6 with an income equivalent to the
relative urban poverty threshold (set at CFAF 7,894 per capita/month) 2/ the
1/   The pilot rural water component is not included, due to non-availability
of cost and revenue data.
2/   The relative urban poverty threshold is calculated at an income of
US$352 per capita per year or CFAF 95,000. It is estimated that in
1980 about 25% of the Abidjan population belongs to the urban poverty
group.



-38 -
water bill, based on a consumption of 40 lcd, would require less than 2% of
their receipts (Their total consumption would be covered by the total tariff).
In the case of an extended family of 15, with an assumed consumption of
33 lcd, almost 70% of their total monthly consumption would fall under the
social tariff. Assuming 2 income earners at the official minimum salary
level, 1/ the monthly water charges would amount to about 3% of that family's
income, well within the generally accepted affordability limit.
6.21      The typical monthly water charge at current rates (theoretical
exercise, as water is billed quarterly) for a modern sector middle-income
household of 8 persons at a daily per capita consumption of 78 1 would amount
to about CFAF 3,300 or to about 3% of monthly income per average household of
this housing type (the monthly income for such a household has been calculated
at CFAF 91,200 in 1977, the most recent year for which data were available).
6.22      For a household living in a more traditional compound habitat (at
6 persons, 40 lcd), it would now mean a monthly bill of about CFAF 900, or a
little more than 1% of the estimated typical monthly income (approx CFAF 65,000
in 1977) for such a household. Details on income distribution estimates are
to be seen in the Project file.
The Urban Poverty Group
6.23      The population not directly connected to the system nor having
access to a well within their compound, are mainly served by commercial water
vendors.  Official water vendors are registered with SODECI and pay a deposit
(up to CFAF 110,000 ) in advance for the subsequent three-month period. They
often invest substantial sums themselves (up to CFAF 500,000) in installing
-their water points in areas which are not serviced. There are now at least
430 "official" water vendors, and presumably many more "informal" vendors
(owners of water connections who distribute water to unconnected neighbors
against a charge). The number of persons served by one water point of an
official vendor is estimated to be around 200; one water vendor may have
several water points, thus serving a whole neighborhood.
6.24      For the urban poverty group, access to water as such is frequently
not a problem at all, rather the problem is the price. At price levels of
CFAF 1 per liter, many households belonging to this group could conceivably
spend more than 5-7% of their monthly revenues on water. Considering the
number of persons (approx. 20% of Abidjan's population) belonging to thiLs
group, a solution will have to be sought which should consider the following
facts of the problem:
while the prices quoted by the vendors are very high, yet one cannot
overlook that their existence has been providing a community service:
otherwise larger pockets in Abidjan would not have had water so fast,
given the tremendous pace of urban growth.
1/   SMIG:  as of January 1980, the rate was CFAF 174/h or CFAF 1392/8 hours a
day.



- 39 -
Further, as mentioned, quite a substantial amount of investment is
involved at the vendor's own risk. It has proved to be quite a dynamic
system, following the movement of population settlements much quicker
than any official distribution system could do.
- in the context of Abidjan, it has proved difficult to introduce increased
installation of standpipes due to high cost of operating and maintenance
coupled with less than satisfactory cost-recovery expectations and the
explicit Government policy in recent years to emphasize house connections,
hence the social connection program.
- Abidjan has seen an enormous influx of nationals of other African
countries, notably from Upper Volta, Guinea and Ghana, seeking better
employment opportunities in the Ivory Coast. Today, their proportion of
the total population is estimated to reach almost 40%, and they account
for the majority of the population of the spontaneous (and mostly illegal)
settlements, which form the core of the urban poverty group, adding,
quite obviously a political dimension to the question of urban poverty.
Only few immigrants have been able to become legal houseowners, entitling
them to apply directly for water connections. Most are relegated to rely
on water vendors.
6.25      A solution should be sought in the wider context of an urban poverty
program for Abidjan, not just for the water supply service alone. The full
dimension of the problem has not been fully recognized in the past, perhaps
understandably so, in the water sector as construction and expansion of a
viable water supply system was accorded priority.
6.26      The proposed sector and organizational study to be executed under
the Project would have as one of its objectives the formulation of future
policies for the transition from a purely growth oriented water supply system
to one which would recognize social services to the poor while maintaining
financial viability (Annex 3-3).
6.27      In the meantime, the Project would seek to:
(i) implement increased numbers of social connections for areas newly
served under the Project and inhabited largely by poverty grovup;
(ii) install a number of standpipes as a temporary solution in the
same newly served areas at a rate of one for 400 persons.
Project Impact on the Urban Poverty Group
Abidjan
6.28      It is estimated that by 1990 the urban poverty group in Abidjan (23%
of total population) will consume about 10% of total domestic consumption, at
30 lcd. Of the portion of the project cost allocated to Abidjan, about 5% or
US $1.2 million is urban poverty lending of funds exclusively benefitting the
poor.



- 40 -
Interior Centers
6.29      Given the scarcity of reliable data on secondary cities, a meaningful
statement is extremely difficult. It is estimated that the impact on the urban
poverty group in the secondary centers would be generally larger than in
Abidjan, as stand pipe consumption will form a much larger share in the
interior centers. However, it is not possible to figure the amount of direct
urban poverty lending for the interior centers.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Govern-
ment on the following matters:
(a)  On-lending of loan proceeds (para 3.05);
(b)  Use of acceptable consultants for detailed engineering, construction
supervision and studies (para 3.07);
(c)  Audit of FNH's and SODECI's accounts and submission of report to
Bank within 9 months of year-end (paras 4.07 and 4.15);
(d)  Government to obtain annual certificate by SODECI's auditors on
billing and collection, and overhead allocation (para 4.16);
(e)  Establishment of fixed asset register and global sector accounts
(para 5.11);
(f)  Provision of Government funds to meet cost overruns (para 5.18);
(g)  Government will continue to reimburse FNH for unremunerative debt
service (para 5.20);
(h)  Annual adjustment of the water surcharge to cover debt service
and to provide for contingencies, and of the basis water rate to
cover operation and maintenance; the Government to consult with the
Bank on introduction of alternative financial performance criteria
if and when annual revision of the water surcharge ceases to be
necessary to meet the above requirements (para 5.24);
(i)  Loans not to be raised unless it can be shown that revenues will
be available for future debt service (para 5.25).
Condition of effectiveness
7.02      It is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan that coun-
terpart loans necessary for the first three years of project implementatLon
have been arranged (para 3.05).
Recommendation
7.03      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project would be
suitable for a Bank loan of US$43 million equivalent to the Government of
Ivory Coast at the prevailing interest rate and terms.

IVORY COAST - Second Water Supply Project
Water Supply Sector Study - Terms of Reference
1.        As part of a project partially financed by the World Bank, a study
is being commissioned of certain aspects of the water supply sector in the
Ivory Coast. The study may be divided into three sub-topics: institutional
structure of the sector; accounting and financial performance criteria;
and the problem of service to the urban poor.
Structure of the Sector
2.        The institutional framework for water supply in Ivory Coast follows
a pattern of shared responsibility. Operation and maintenance are assigned
to a private company, Societe de Distribution d'Eau de la Cote d'Ivoire
(SODECI), which collects and retains the basic water rate in payment for its
services. The planning and execution of practically all capital investment is
carried out by Direction Centrale de l'Hydraulique (DCH), a Government depart-
ment; while finance for these investments is provided by Fonds National de
1'Hydraulique (FNH) which raises loans and other capital, and pays the related
debt service out of a special surcharge on the water rate calculated to cover
this expense.
3.        While this system has worked effectively and well, using the dyna-
mism of private enterprise under the control of Government, the division of
responsibility carries inherent risks of incomplete coordination, undue con-
flict of interest, and insufficiency of day-to-day operational controls. In
the long term, some streamlining of the sector may be desirable, particularly
when the present major program of works to upgrade service levels is completed.
4.        The consultant will be expected to familiarize himself with the aims,
needs and constraints of the sector entities, make recommendations for the
most effective long-term institutional structure of the sector to meet its
future needs, and suggest interim steps towards attaining this goal. The
criteria to be retained include:
(a) maintenance of the present excellent service to the consumer;
(b)  most economical use of financial resources to minimize the present
heavy burden on the consumer; and
(c) effective overall supervision of the sector to maximize coordination
in construction, operation and finance, without however creating
unwieldy bureaucracies.
5.        Part of the financial burden on the urban consumer derives from lthe
cost of the rapidly-expanding village water supply service. Until 1981, no
charge at all was made to villagers, though now a system of community contri-
butions to the cost of maintenance has just been established; however, the
As part of the study of the institutional structure of the sector, the consul-
tant will be expected to make recommendations for the most effective system
for administering rural water supplies (without however prejudicing the
present efficient arrangements for maintenance of facilities) and at the same
time suggest a more equitable mechanism of cost recovery for the capital
and recurrent expenditures incurred on this service. The ultimate goal being
that the villagers will become completely responsible for their wells, probably
using local contractors for additional wells and maintenance.

6.        For the Government and lending agencies one of the drawbacks of
the fragmented sector structure is that there is no overall picture of the
sector's finances. SOOECI's accounts cover only part of the water sector, but
also cover activities other than water without clearly separating the activi-
ties; FNH and DCH cover the rest of the sector, but have different fiscal
years to SODECI; and the sector's fixed assets are nowhere recorded, even at
their historical cost. An inventory and valuation as of 1978 was made by
consultants, but this requires updating and revaluing year by year.
7.        Under a World Bank project, a financial expert is attached to DCH, with
assigned duties which include:
(a) creation of a systematic financial control of SODECI's analytical
accounting and the accuracy of its metering, billing and collection
in view of the Government's annual review of tariffs;
(b) creation of a fixed assets register, showing updated values,
less depreciation;
(c) the compilation year by year of global sector accounts, consolidating
the activities of DCH, FNH and SODECI.
The consultant will be required to formulate recommendations on:
(i) the format and methodology for these tasks;
(ii) the effective use of the information so compiled for improving
coordination, cost effectiveness, and overall sector management.
Such financial statistics can throw light on policy questions such as the
return on capital invested, appropriateness of tariff structures, extent of
cross-subsidization in the tariff, sector capital structure, financial ratios,
per capita investment, etc; and the consultant should have regard to these
possibilities in making his recommendations.
8.        At present, the tariff is fixed to cover:
(a) operating and maintenance costs; and
(b) debt service, in separate components.
With the high debt service arising from the ongoing heavy investment program,
the only appropriate criterion for tariff adequacy, at present, is that these
costs are covered. When however the peak of capital expenditure is passed and
the debt service burden is lightened, it may be desirable to substitute other
measures of financial performance (especially when the global sector informa-
tion envisaged above is available)--such as rate of return on net fixed assets
in service, or a percentage of self-financing of annual capital expenditure.
Using the best available projections of future capital expenditure, recurrent
costs, and sales, the consultant should advise on whether such an alternative
criterion for financial performance in the sector will become appropriate in
the foreseeable future, and, if so, its most suitable form and magnitude.

Service to Disadvantaged Classes among Urban Residents
9.        Large segments of the urban population in Ivory Coast, particularly
in Abidjan, occupy unregulated developments where the provisions of an adequate
water supply system comes up against such difficulties as: (a) lack of physical
planning, (b) the transient character of the population, (c) cost recovery
problems. For these and other reasons, neither private connections nor public
standpipes are numerous, and the vacuum is filled by private standpipes ope-
rated by water vendors, charging a price many times the public tariff. Surveys
exist, which will be made available to the consultant, of household incomes,
water usage, expenditure on water and other services, etc. in these areas.
10.       Until now, the emphasis has been on maintaining the standard-of
service and the financial viability of the existing system, combined with a
program to encourage household connections. The increasingly structured urban
social environment will become more demanding. Attention will, therefore,
have to focus increasingly on the provision of social services to the poor,
while maintaining financial viability of the water supply system. The consul-
tant will be required to investigate the constraints which prevent cheap water
being made available to the poorest classes and make recommendations covering:
(i) the most economical and practical method of physical delivery
of water to such people;
(ii)  any measures needed to limit consumption or to minimize the risk of
water waste in such a system;
(iii) feasible proposals for financing the cost of supply, either
through direct charging, indirect charging (e.g. by occupation
tax) or public funds (e.g. municipal revenues);
(iv) implications for other services, e.g. sewerage and drainage.
11.       On this subject, the consultant will require to consult other
entities concerned, such as the municipalities and the Ministry of Urbanism,
to ascertain public policy on these settlements.

rived from definitive billing statistics; (b) the former also include revenues from
direct pumping fees.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
Income Statements
1.        Sales are based on projections established by the mission after
consultation with DCH and SODECI. Receipts from water surcharge collections
are forecast using a recovery pattern based on past experience of SODECI, as
follows:
Collected in:
Billings for Year N                   Year N      Year N+1
First three quarters at tariff to Sept. 30    50%           21.25%
Last quarter at tariff from Oct. 1                -         22.25%
(Expressed as percentages of a full year's revenue at that tariff, the
balance making up 100% being deemed irrecoverable, though in practice
many such arrears are ultimately recovered.)
2.        This produces the following results:

3.        Other revenues, including subsidy towards debt service on certain
loans, are projected on information supplied by FNH.
4.        Debt service on identified loans is calculated on the anticipated
conditions of the various lenders; for the proposed Bank loan, 9.6% interest
was assumed with repayment over 17 years, including four years of grace. In
the case of unidentified loans, various terms and conditions were used, mainly
at 12-15% over twelve years including two years of grace.
5.        FNH's operating expenses are based on projections by FNH.
Funds Flow Statements
6.        Capital expenditure on the project assumes payment lagging three
months behind value of work done, with Bank disbursements according to the
disbursement schedule in the main Report. Expenditure outside the project is
estimated from the official capital program up to 1985, with some modifica-
tions; after 1985, estimates are tentative. Disbursements of non-Bank loans



- 56 -
Annex 5-3
Page 2 of 2
are sometimes assumed to be in step with expenditure, but in other cases
(particularly local loans), disbursement is assumed to be in a lump sum on
loan signature.
Balance Sheets
7.        Accounts payable and receivable consist largely of random amounts
being internal balances due to or from CAA on closure of accounts, and
cannot be predicted; they are deemed to change little affer 1982, in the
impossibility of more accurate forecasts.
