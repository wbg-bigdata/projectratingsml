INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE IVORY COAST
FOR A SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of the Ivory Coast for the equivalent of US$43.0 million to
help finance a second water supply project. The loan would have a term of
17 years, including four years of grace, with interest at 11.6 percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        "Ivory Coast:  A Basic Economic Report" (1147b-IVC) was circulated
to the Executive Directors in May 1977. It was published in 1978 by the Johns
Hopkins University Press under the title "The Challenge of Success". Its
assessment of the country's economic prospects, updated by Bank missions in
each subsequent year, is reflected in the following paragraphs. Basic economic
data and social indicators are summarized in Annex I.
3.        Since 1960, when GDP per capita was US$145, the country has experi-
enced a 7 percent per annum GDP growth rate, a pace of development that has
surpassed that of most non-oil exporting countries and which resulted in a
1980 GDP per capita of US$1,200, the second highest in sub-saharan Africa.
From the outset, the Government has pursued economic growth as its primary
objective. A political framework was established that promoted an open and
stable economy. Political ideology played a secondary role to practical
considerations in promoting growth and development. The open economy proved
to be a strong attraction to foreign factors of production. As a result,
there has been a massive immigration of both unskilled labor from poor
neighboring countries and skilled technicians and managers from Europe.
Today, immigrants (mainly non-Ivorian Africans) constitute about 30 percent
of the country's population. Neighboring countries enjoyed substantial
benefits from the outflow of workers' remittances from the employment that
their surplus labor force was able to find in the Ivory Coast. Close rela-
tions with France through, inter alia, the West African Monetary Union,
ensured currency convertibility and a relatively stable balance of payments
framework.
4.        From Independence, agriculture was identified as the key to the
country's growth potential. Tropical rainforests covered large areas in the
South, and their successful (if overly extensive) exploitation gave the
1/   This section is substantially the same as Part I of the President's
Report on the Structural Adjustment Loan, dated November 4, 1981.
Some parts of the presentation have been condensed.

country foreign exchange resources for investment. These areas were suitable
for growing coffee, cocoa, and other crops. The agricultural potential of the
North was more limited, and it therefore was developed more slowly and to a
lesser extent. But food crops, cotton, and livestock were successfully
promoted. Value added in the agricultural sector grew by an average of over
5 percent per year.
5.        In support of this agricultural development, Government developed
physical infrastructure. For example, access to transportation was assured
through a good network of feeder roads linked to a well-developed and main-
tained secondary and trunk road network. An excellent and well-managed
deepwater port was developed at Abidjan, the capital, and a second port more
recently at San Pedro in the West.
6.        Other sectors of the economy also grew rapidly.  Industry, parti-
cularly agro-industry, grew at 12 percent per year. Most investment exploited
import substitution potential such as in cotton textiles. The tertiary sector
grew rapidly based partly on demand generated by agriculture and industry, and
partly on demand resulting from government policies to provide infrastructure
to support development.
7.        The combination of decisions to promote government investment in
both infrastructure and the parapublic sector led to a growing public invest-
ment program. Although investment rates increased from 14 percent of GDP in
the early 1960s to well over 20 percent by the mid-1970s, large public sector
savings and increasing external borrowing were available to finance the
expanded program. Moreover, through the mid-1970s, the balance of payments
position remained strong, as coffee and cocoa prices continued to increase.
8.        Under the impetus of the boom in coffee and cocoa prices in late 1976
and 1977, Government expanded the public investment program in 1978 to more
than $2 billion, almost one-fourth of the GDP, under the erroneous assumption
that prices of these commodities would remain high. With the increase in
public investment, its quality declined. Thus, the 1976-80 Plan experienced a
40 percent overrun in real terms, in contrast to the 8 percent overrun of the
previous Plan. High unit costs as well as excessive scale especially of
sugar, transport and education programs accounted for the overrun.
9.        External debt provided 40 percent of the financing.  Debt service,
therefore, rose rapidly and reached $700 million in the late 1970s. But
because of both lower-priority projects, particularly in the public enter-
prise sector, and projects with very long pay-off periods (in education, for
example), export earnings did not increase commensurately, so that debt
service ratios rose to over 25 percent by the end of the decade. In addition,
current expenditure also increased and public expenditure (current plus
capital) reached 41 percent of GDP. This reduced Government's ability to
react to changing economic circumstances.



- 3 -
10.       Coffee and cocoa export earnings declined precipitously after 1979,
and, by 1981, had lost over 50 percent of their peak (1977 and 1978) prices.
Furthermore, import prices continued to increase with inflation. Thus terms
of trade declined by about 35 percent from 1978 to 1981, and the balance of
payments entered a period of stringency.
11.       Public finance problems also emerged.  Savings fell sharply as
government marketing surpluses from coffee and cocoa were reduced by about
$600 million from 1977 and 1978 to the present. The claims of debt service,
of recurrent costs from completed projects, and of a few large cost overruns
generated strong fiscal pressures. The public enterprise sector began to
incur large deficits because of higher current costs which were not matched by
returns on investment. The recurrent costs of the education sector, which
account for 46 percent of the current budget, have become particularly burden-
some.
12.       Finally, although agriculture had been the key sector in the Ivory
Coast's rapid development, over the last four or five years the sector has,
with few exceptions, lost much of its dynamism. This has been a contributing
cause to the above problems, although changing world market conditions have
also contributed substantially. For example, foodcrop production is apparently
stagnant, requiring increasing imports to meet needs. This can be traced to
growing financial problems, a decline in institutional effectiveness, and
inadequate price and other policies.
Prospects
13.       Three important elements stand out in a discussion of the country's
economic prospects. First, the country still has a strong agricultural
growth potential. Although diminishing returns and changes-in world market
conditions make the choice of future investment more difficult, the country's
underlying productivity remains. The period of bold large investment projects
in agriculture may be over. What is needed is judicious planning, careful
investment preparation, and better management of the state enterprises,
particularly those in the agricultural sector.
14.       The second factor is oil.  Recent developments in the off-shore
exploration program which started in the mid-1970's are encouraging. Produc-
tion in the Belier field began in 1980 at a rate of 9,000-10,000 barrels per
day through 1981, declining to 8,000 barrels per day in 1982. Production in
the Espoir field will start in 1982, and data so far gathered indicate good
prospects for further findings. There are, however, two problems associated
with petroleum development. The first is the very costly type of drilling and
development required in the Espoir field. Secondly, development to date has
required a long period of time for technical reasons, and future development
is therefore difficult to predict.



- 4 -
15.       The uncertainty associated with petroleum development requires that
immediate action be taken to reduce the balance of payments and fiscal defi-
cits to keep the short-term situation manageable. In the medium term,
improved government planning will be essential to restore growth in agricul-
ture and other sectors. These improvements will ensure that, when large
petroleum revenues become available, they are put to productive use. More
efficient use of resources to meet government objectives is all the more
important since there is a possibility that oil revenues will be available for
a fixed and relatively short period. Income creation based on petroleum will
need to generate self-sustaining growth, including diversification from the
current high dependence on a few primary products.
16.       Thirdly, the country has embarked on a program of financial rehabi-
litation designed to ensure adequate allocations for essential programs
summarized in the Extended Fund Facility Agreement with the IMF, and a program
of structural adjustment to overcome the weaknesses described above. The
program calls for strengthening of mechanisms for macro-economic planning and
programming of resources, improved agricultural pricing and incentive policies,
and identifies programs to be implemented in the public enterprises and the
industrial sector. These are designed to overcome weaknesses noted above
namely, the past excessive public sector expansion, deficiencies in the
investment programming, and the recent stagnation in agriculture. One of the
objectives of the program is to keep debt service manageable. With the pro-
gram, it should be possible to keep debt service at about 30 percent through
1985 and under 25 percent for the rest of the decade, and to maintain credit-
worthiness for borrowing on IBRD terms.
17.       Of the total external public debt outstanding at the end of 1979,
15 percent was provided bilaterally by governments, 14 percent by interna-
tional aid agencies (of which 65 percent by the Bank Group), and 56 percent by
private banks and bond issues, while 15 percent came in the form of suppliers'
credit. About half of the total capital not supplied by international aid
agencies came from four countries: France (21 percent), USA (13 percent),
Lebanon (6 percent), and the Federal Republic of Germany (4 percent). France
and the European Communities remain the principal source of development
assistance in grant form, accounting for about 1 percent of the flow of
foreign assistance to the public sector.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE IVORY COAST
18.       Since 1968, when Bank Group operations in the Ivory Coast started,
lending has expanded rapidly and now includes forty-three loans totalling
US$875.3 million (including US$14 million from the Third Window), and an IDA
credit of US$7.5 million. Of these operations fifteen have been for agricul-
ture, supporting cotton, cocoa, rubber, oil palm and coconut development, and
rural development in the North-East Savannah region. There were six road pro-
jects and a highway sector project. The remaining twenty-one loans were for
education, telecommunications, the Abidjan sewerage and drainage system, water



- 5 -
supply, urban development, power distribution, tourism development, small-
and medium-scale enterprises, a regional cement project, a regional railway
project and most recently for structural adjustment and related technical
assistance. IFC's involvement includes participation in the Banque Ivoirienne
de Developpement Industriel amounting to US$423,500; a 10 percent equity
investment, equivalent to about US$880,000, in Etablissement R. Gonfreville
(ERG), the largest textile plant in the country; and a US$6.4 million invest-
ment in Societe Ivoirienne d'Engrais S.A. (Siveng) to double the company's
fertilizer plant capacity to 120,000 tons per year; on March 1980, IFC Board
of Directors approved an equity investment of US$446,600 and a US$2.9 million
loan for MSO, a flour milling company. Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank Group operations and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
Generally satisfactory implementation of projects in the Ivory Coast is
reflected in better than average disbursement profiles; however, speedier
submission of withdrawal applications to the Bank is possible, and means to
streamline the procedures are being considered by Government.
19.       Bank operations in agriculture have been in support of the Govern-
ment's policy of crop diversification and promotion of exports and giving
more emphasis to developing smallholder production. A smallholder rubber
project was approved by the Board in October 1978, and a rural development
project for the North-East in March 1980. In June 1979, the Executive
Directors approved-the first Bank forestry project in the Ivory Coast which
consists of a 20,000 ha plantation program of short- and medium-rotation
hardwood species. The structural adjustment loan, approved by the Board
in November 1981, supports a program of macro-economic reform and of adjust-
ment focussed in agriculture including far-reaching interim and long-term
reforms of agricultural public enterprises. The technical assistance project,
approved together with SAL, provides much of the technical manpower needed
for policy reorientation and implementation of new programs. The Bank is
currently processing a rural development project in the Center-West, which
covers part of the area of responsibility of SATMACI and complements in
specific fields the efforts of the SAL. In the future, the Bank is contem-
plating assisting integrated rural development projects in the North and
North-West regions which will be primarily designed to execute the integrated
crop strategy to be developed under the structural adjustment program. The
Bank is also associated with the preparation of a mechanization study and
pilot scheme, carried out by the French CCCE, to determine the feasibility of
introducing light mechanized farming.
20.       Bank involvement in the transport sector started in 1969 by carrying
out, as executing agency, the UNDP Transport Survey of the Ivory Coast, which
has served as a basis for determining future priorities among transport
investments. Thus far the Bank has granted loans for six road projects
totalling $123.3 million, and for a highway sector project in the amount of
$100 million, which was approved in November 1980. The first project was
completed in December 1974 with final costs falling within appraisal estimates.
The OED report on this project dated June 28, 1977, recommended inter alia,
that more emphasis should be given to road maintenance.  This had been picked
up in the Third Highway Project. The Second Road Project was satisfactorily
completed in September 1975, after an initial delay caused by project modifi-
cation and subsequent poor work organization for the construction component.



- 6 -
The Third and Fourth Highway Projects, which are completed, incurred substan-
tial cost overruns which the Government has covered; otherwise, execution
proceeded satisfactorily. The Fifth Highway Project, which is near completion,
will contribute to a further improvement of the primary road network of the
country. A feeder roads and highway maintenance project was approved in
December 1977. The highway sector loan to finance a portion of the country-s
highway investment program for 1981-83 is now operative. A railway project,
focusing on the improvement of the Bouake-Petionara section of the Abidjan-
Ouagadougou rail line, renewal of rolling stock, technical assistance and
training, was approved in FY78. A Second Railway Project to complete the
rehabilitation from Petionara to Tafire has been prepared under the First
Project, and is being appraised.
21.       The Bank has been closely associated with the Government-s efforts
to modernize the education system, in particular, at the primary, secondary
and vocational levels, through two education projects. A Third Education
Project covering primary teacher training, vocational training and informal
education in rural areas was approved by the Executive Directors in December
1979.
22.       The Abidjan sewerage and drainage project, approved in FY75, covers
the first phase of a ten-year government program to improve sanitation in
Abidjan. The Board approved, in FY78, a second project which includes the
second phase of the program and studies for the third. An urban development
project, whose primary aim is to help meet some of Abidjan-s low-income
housing and transport needs, was signed in December 1976. A second urban
development project, approved in August 1981, aims at improving the living
conditions of populations in low-income urban areas by continuing and building
up on the efforts undertaken in the former project, and by assisting Govern-
ment in carrying out its regional development policy oriented towards shifting
rapid urban growth from the capital cities to regional centers. With respect
to the smaller towns, the Board approved in FY78 a secondary centers water
supply project. The proposed project for water supply in secondary centers
and villages aims at improving the living conditions of urban populations
across the country.
23.       In the energy sector, a First Power Project was approved in July
1980 to finance power distribution facilities in rural areas, technical
assistance and the preparation of a hydropower project which the Bank is
considering financing. Recently, the Government has requested Bank finan-
cial assistance for further exploration and production of the new off-shore
petroleum field, l-Espoir, and the project is currently being appraised.
24.       In view of the predominance of foreign ownership and management
in the private sector of the Ivorian economy, the Government is placing
high priority on strengthening local entrepreneurship. In support of this
policy, the Bank extended a loan for the promotion of small-scale enterprises
in FY76, which has been followed up by an artisans, small- and medium-scale
project approved in March 1979. The Bank Group also provided support for
medium-scale enterprises through another local development finance company



- 7 -
and two lines of credit for hotel financing and technical assistance in the
tourism sector. In June 1976, the Bank extended a loan to the Ivory Coast
in support of the CIMAO project which is sponsored jointly by the Govern-
ments of Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Togo. CIMAO utilizes limestone deposits
in Togo for the production of clinker for the cement market of the three
countries.
25.       The Bank Group's lending in the Ivory Coast has increased steadily
from a yearly average of below US$20 million during the early years to an
average of US$74.2 million annually in the 1975-79 period. The average annual
lending rate is expected to continue to grow substantially over the next few
years. The Bank Group-s share of the Ivory Coast-s external debt at the end
of 1979, stood at approximately 10.4 percent (including undisbursed). Its
portion of external debt disbursed is expected to rise from the present 6.4
percent to about 10 percent in the next ten years; its share of total debt
service, 4.2 percent in 1979, is expected to go up to about 6.0 percent in
the early 1980's.
PART III - THE WATER AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Water Resources and Sector Organization
26.       The Ivory Coast has an abundant rainfall in the South, 2,090 mm
in Abidjan, gradually diminishing further north, the northern part of the
country being a savannah-type countryside. The coastal zone is the only area
where groundwater is found in large quantity. In most of the rest of the
country, groundwater is found in small quantities sufficient for the use of
village wells and small pump systems. Recently, the use of modern techniques
principally hydrogeological analysis of aerial photographs to detect favorable
drill sites, has made this resource exploitable at reasonable cost. Abidjan
is currently supplied entirely from groundwater. About a third of the surface
water systems for the secondary centers have dammed-storage to tide them over
the annual dry periods.
27.       The structure of the water supply, sewerage and drainage sector
in Ivory Coast presents an unusual pattern of shared responsiblity, in which
operation and maintenance, capital works, and capital finance are each assigned
to different agencies. However, Government retains the ownership of the sector
assets as well as the power to establish sector policy and to determine tariff
levels. In the water supply sub-sector, operation and maintenance is assigned
to Societe de Distribution d'Eau de la Cote d'Ivoire (SODECI), a private com-
pany which also bills and collects water and sewer rates; the planning, design
and construction of water supply facilities, as well as general supervision of
SODECI on behalf of Government, are the responsibility of Direction Centrale
de 1'Hydraulique (DCH), a sub-division of the Ministry of Public Works; and
the management of debt and capital finance is the function of Fonds National
de l'Hydraulique (FNH), an autonomous Government agency under the tutelage



- 8 -
of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. In the sewerage and drainage sub-
sector, a similar structure prevails: SODECI is responsible for operation and
maintenance, Societe d'Equipement des Terrains Urbains (SETU) -- Government
land development company--is responsible for planning and execution of capital
works, and Fonds National de l'Assainissement (FNA)--a sister agency of
FNH--is responsible for capital finance; there is also a Direction Centrale de
l'Assainissement (DCA) in the Ministry of Public Works responsible for general
sub-sector supervision.
28.       This fragmented institutional structure works effectively and well.
It has allowed each agency to concentrate on its function with little inter-
agency friction and has resulted in sound financial discipline, efficient
execution of capital works and competent operation and maintenance of the
systems. However, Government ought to give some thought to the changes which
might be required in the sector organization in the long term when the stage
of development of the sector may warrant a different structure fitted to its
future needs. The whole question of future development of the sector's
institutional structure and finance will be studied as part of the proposed
project.
The Institutions
29.       DCH is a competent engineering organization which has discharged
its responsibilities satisfactorily, but relies heavily on expatriate skills.
Under the first water supply project (Loan 1484-IVC) the Government undertook
to prepare a recruitment and training plan for the gradual replacement of
expatriates, but this has proved incapable of fulfillment because of recruit-
ment difficulties mostly arising from the shortage of Ivorian engineers.
Since then, the new school of engineering in Yamoussoukro has been opened
and the proposed loan includes funds for post-graduate training for newly-
qualified Ivorians emerging from that school. One weakness of DCH is insuffi-
cient financial expertise which is required to supervise SODECI on behalf of
the State and to deal with tariff reviews and financial administration of
contracts. Government agreed under Loan 1484-IVC to recruit an additional
financial expert, but this has not wholly met the requirements and revised
terms of reference for this post have been drawn up, including the establish-
ment of a fixed assets register by end 1982 and eventually a consolidated set
of accounts for the whole sector (Section 4.04 of the draft Loan Agreement),
to assist in policy decision-making. The replacement expert, now being
recruited for this post, would be financed under the proposed project.
30.       FNH is an autonomous legal entity created in January 1976 under
the tutelage of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. FNH raises loans, pays
contractors on advices from DCH and services debt out of a special surcharge
on water bills earmarked for this purpose. FNH and FNA have a common manage-
ment and staff provided by the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA). FNH
is competently administered and its accounts are generally well-kept. Under
Loan 1484-IVC an expert to assist FNH and FNA and the computerization of CAA's
records have helped to overcome previous accounting shortcomings. Because of
the continuing increase in the workload and need for this expatriate expert,
financing for the extension of his services for a further three years is
provided in the proposed project.

31.       SODECI is a private company owned approximately 48 percent by French
interests and 52 percent by Ivorian stockholders. In turn, SODECI has part-
interests in a real-estate corporation, a meter assembly company, a bottling
plant and a civil engineering company; it pays dividends regularly (15 percent
in recent years) and its shares are quoted in the Abidjan Stock Exchange.
SODECI is efficiently managed and provides first-class service to its customers;
water quality and pressure are uniformly good and unaccounted-for water is
kept down to about 20 percent, which is very satisfactory. Although still
relying on expatriate skills, the proportion of Ivorians in senior posts has
been increasing in the last few years and this trend is expected to be re-
inforced now that SODECI has established its own center for training Ivorians.
32.       SODECI is responsible for operation and maintenance of all water
supply and sewerage and drainage systems under various agency agreements:
a concession" contract for the Abidjan system and a management contract
for other urban systems and village wells--both with Government--and an
operation and maintenance contract for sewerage and drainage, as agent for
SETU. For its water supply activities SODECI is remunerated by a separate
component of the water tariff which is calculated on agreed standards of
service, adequately costed, plus a margin for profit. SODECI is also respon-
sible for collection of revenues for FNH and FNA to whom it transfers collec-
tions periodically.
Objectives and Policies - Water Tariff
33.       The basic objective of expanding access to safe water at the fastest
pace compatible with the country s financial constraints and the general aim
of Government to reduce regional disparities in the living conditions, and
in particular between the capital city and the rest of the country, have been
the guiding principles of the development of the sector. To meet these
objectives the Government adopted in the early seventies the policy of finan-
cial self-support in the sector. Thus, fixed assets are financed practically
entirely by debt, such debt being serviced entirely with a surcharge added to
the water rate for this purpose. Also, in 1974, Government introduced a
countrywide uniform tariff for urban piped water. (Water from village wells
in rural areas has traditionally been free, though a system of maintenance
contributions by villagers is being established). This scheme entails cross-
subsidies from the consumers of large centers (principally Abidjan) to those
of small centers and to villagers, and alleviates some of the effects of
relatively higher cost of smaller systems.
34.       The water tariff in the Ivory Coast has three components:  the
basic rate, calculated to cover SODECI's costs of operation and maintenance,
and two surcharges--one for sewerage, accruing to FNA, and one for water,
accruing to FNH, both calculated to cover their respective debt service
and operating costs. This tariff structure, besides confirming the strong
Government commitment to sector self-financing, ensures that maintenance
standards are not sacrificed to provide funds for debt service, and vice-
versa. Furthermore, the causes of tariff increases are easier to identify and
hence justify. Tariffs are normally reviewed yearly.



- 10 -
35.       The tariff structure includes a "social tariff" for the first 10 m3
per month, the rate being only 57 percent of the full rate, which benefits
principally the small consumer. In addition, small consumers may be entitled
to exemption from connection charges. There are also reduced rates for public
supplies, including public standpipes paid for by municipalities.
36.       Government has adopted in February 1981 a revised version of the
1974-85 water supply development program whose objectives are: (i) to extend
and modernize existing systems to make optimum use of past investments;
(ii) provide by 1985 every center over 3,000 inhabitants with piped water,
and (iii) complete the original wells program (11,000 wells) by 1982 and to
construct 4,000 additional wells during 1982-85. The objectives of this
program, which the proposed project supports, would maintain the percentage of
the increasing urban population in Abidjan served with house connections at 60
percent and would increase the percentage from 29 percent to 33 percent in
centers other than the capital, by 1985; it would also provide every village
over 100 inhabitants with a well and a maximum served population per well of
400 inhabitants.
Past Bank Assistance to the Sector
37.       The Bank has made a $16.0 million loan for the secondary centers
water supply systems (Loan 1484-IVC of September 9, 1977) and two loans of
$9.0 million and $33 million (Loan 1076-IVC of January 1975 and Loan 1577-IVC
of May 1979, respectively) for the Abidjan sewerage and drainage system. Per-
formance in both sectors has been generally satisfactory. The first sewerage
project was completed on schedule, the project substantially meeting its
objectives (OED report dated August 26, 1981). The first phase of the second
sewerage project started in January 1980 and was 90 percent completed by
end 1981; the second phase started in mid-1981 and progress is good. The
basic objectives of the secondary centers water supply project are being
achieved, although one year behind schedule due to slower than foreseen
process of selection of two centers to be included in the project and under-
staffing problems in DCH. This is an area of project implementation where
performance was weak, i.e. training and recruitment of Ivorians in DCH, and
which are addressed under the proposed project (para. 29).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
38.       The proposed project aims at improving the living conditions of
urban populations across the country by continuing Bank support to the devel-
opment of the water supply sector, both in its physical expansion and in its
institutional aspects. The project was identified in the course of super-
vision of the first water supply project and prepared by DCH with the assis-
tance of the Bank and CEAO (Economic Community of Western Africa). An
appraisal mission visited the country in May/June 1980 and again in March
1981. Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. on January 25-29, 1982;
the Government delegation was headed by Mr. Gbozia, Director General of FNH
and included Messrs. Djouka, Director General of DCH, and Zadi-Kessi, Director



- 11 -
General of SODECI. The project is described in detail in Staff Appraisal
Report No. 3610-IVC, dated April 1, 1982, which is being distributed separately
to the Executive Directors. Supplementary data on the project is to be found
in Annex III.
Project Concept and Description
39.       In order to assist in the development of the water supply sector
so as to provide maximum service, within the existing financial and managerial
constraints, the project would help optimize present investments by providing
marginal additions to the Abidjan system (the main revenue earner in the
country), promote greater utilization of existing systems in secondary centers
by providing consumer connectioas, assist DCH and FNH in upgrading their
technical and financial management, and explore further ways of streamlining
the sector organization in the long-term. To achieve these objectives the
project would comprise a major part of the 1982-85 water supply investment
program and would consist of:
(a) investments in the Abidjan system to increase water production
facilities, increase storage capacity, provide for a 7km transmis-
sion main and reinforcing the distribution system, as well as
continuation of studies on the available groundwater resources and
study of a centralized production and water pressure control system;
(b) about 300 km of distribution extension, as well as small ad-
ditions to production and storage facilities for 52 secondary
centers;
(c) about 10,000 house connections to provide service for poor segments
of the population under the social connections program;
(d) about 300 village wells;
(e) supply and installation of computer equipment for the Cadastre and
property tax administration;
(f) consultant services to (i) carry out final design and construc-
tion supervision of the above, (ii) carry out a sector study to
assess long-term needs of the sector and the appropriate institu-
tional arrangements to deal with them, and (iii) to carry out land
surveys to update the Cadastre; and
(g)  technical assistance and training for DCH and FNH.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
40.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $57.3 million, of
which $43.0 million in foreign exchange. Total project costs are exclusive
of taxes and are estimated at mid-1981 prices. The average cost of consultant
services and technical assistance (including salary, social charges, inter-
national travel, local allowances and company overhead) is estimated according
to the official Ivorian fee scale at about $11,100 per man-month. A 13
percent allowance for physical contingencies was added to the base costs.



- 12 -
Price contingencies amounting to 36 percent of base costs were estimated on
the assumption of an annual inflation rate of 12 percent for both civil works
and equipment, and a construction profile of four years starting in 1982.
41.       The proposed Bank loan of $43.0 million would cover the estimated
foreign exchange costs. CEAO and Government are discussing a possible par-
ticipation of CEAO in the financing of the village well component. While the
proposed Bank loan would be made to the Government, CEAO has offered to enter
into a bilateral agreement with Government to assume the debt service of the
Bank loan related to the village well component, and to finance a declining
percentage of its operation and maintenance costs for about five years.
In line with the sector policy (para. 33) it is planned that FNH would finance
local costs from borrowings; in order to assure the availability of such
counterpart funds, the execution of such borrowings of FNH to be assigned to
the proposed project, in an amount of at least US$8.5 million equivalent,
would be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan (Section 6.01(b) of the
draft Loan Agreement).  Should there be cost overruns, Government would cause
the necessary funds to be provided. The Bank loan would be made to the
Government and it would be on-lent to FNH on the same terms.  Execution of a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement to this effect between the Government and FNH would
also be a condition of effectiveness (Section 6.01(a) of the draft Loan
Agreement).
Project Implementation
42.       DCH will be responsible for the implementation of the project
with the assistance of consultants satisfactory to the Bank. Such consultants
are being retained to prepare detailed engineering designs and to supervise
the construction of the entire project except for the village well component
which will be supervised by DCH. Terms of reference for the sector studies
were agreed upon during negotiations and consultants to carry them out under
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank are being sought. Construction
is expected to commence in early 1983 and to be completed in early 1987.
Financial Aspects and Audits
43.       The need for, and Government's commitment to, strict financial dis-
cipline in the sector has been referred to above in this report and has led
to adjustments in the agreements reached under the loan for the first water
supply project to allow for better monitoring of the sector's financial per-
formance. Loan 1484-IVC contained a tariff covenant, in respect of the water
surcharge component only, in terms of a rate of return. This provided broadly
that the revenues from the surcharge (i.e. amounts billed), after deducting
FNH's own administrative costs, should cover notional depreciation on the
estimated value of net fixed assets in service, plus a 3% return on that
value. With hindsight, it is not clear that the rate of return concept is at
this stage appropriate in the Ivory Coast context. One of the underlying
reasons for ROR covenants is to ensure adequate cash generation for expansion.
However there can be no cash generation unless the surcharge is higher than is
needed to cover debt service, and it would be excessive to require this in the
Ivory Coast with almost 100 percent debt financing repayable over periods much
shorter than asset lives. The resultant surcharge already bears heavily on
consumers, and this burden will become progressively heavier.



- 13 -
44.       A more appropriate and practical measure of tariff adequacy would
relate the cash proceeds of the surcharge to the debt service requirements
they are intended to cover and this, in fact, would result in a positive rate
of return. At some future date, when the period of peak debt service for the
ongoing major development program is past, and when an updated record of fixed
assets should be available, it may be appropriate to reintroduce the rate of
return concept, rather than reduce the surcharge. Accordingly, the rate of
return covenant of the first loan is replaced by the covenants in the draft
loan agreement by which Government agrees to (i) revise annually the water
surcharge to cover debt service and operating costs of FNH plus a provision
to create a margin for contingencies equal to 10 percent of each year's debt
service, and (ii) consult with the Bank on the introduction of a tariff policy
embodying either a rate of return or cash generation objective, if in any
year the existing surcharge would be sufficient to meet the above criteria
without revision (Section 4.06(a and b) of the draft Loan Agreement). To
complete the pattern of ensuring adequate sector financing, the Government has
also agreed to revise annually the basic water rate component of the tariff to
cover the cost of operations and maintenance (Section 4.06(c) of the draft
Loan Agreement).
45.       To complement the above-mentioned arrangements, the Government has
agreed to a debt limitation covenant by which FNH would not incur additional
long-term debt unless a reasonable forecast of the revenues and expenditures
of FNH shows that projected internal cash generation is sufficient to serve
the total debt for which it is responsible every year during the maturity of
the debt to be contracted (Section 4.05 of the draft Loan Agreement).
46.       The accounts of both FNH and SODECI are currently audited by indepen-
dent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and Government has agreed to continue
this practice and to make the auditors reports available to the Bank within
nine months of their respective year-end (Section 4.03 of the draft Loan
Agreement). DCH is subject to the normal financial controls of government
departments, which is satisfactory to the Bank. Project accounts would also
be available for inspection by Bank supervision missions.
Procurement
47.       Procurement would be carried out by international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines, except for a few
small contracts. Contracts for purchase of plant equipment and vehicles,
estimated to cost less than US$100,000 each and contracts for civil works
estimated to cost less than US$200,000 each would be let on the basis of local
competitive procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank. These contracts
would be subject to a maximum aggregate of US$2 million. Contracts for the
construction of social connections, estimated to cost an aggregate of US$4
million, will be executed by SODECI in view of their scattered nature in time
and place. These contracts would be negotiated with SODECI on an annual basis
and executed by force account.
Disbursements
48.       The loan proceeds will be disbursed in the following manner:



- 14 -
(a) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost for direct imports or
80 percent of the total cost of locally purchased goods;
(b) 70 percent of total costs of civil works;
(c) 90 percent of total costs of consultants and training.
Disbursements are expected to start in early 1983 and to be completed by
March 1988.
Urban Poverty Group
49.       About 20 percent of the urban poor in the Ivory Coast have house
connections. The rest have access to water through the system of water
vendors, whether "official"--those under contract with SODECI--or "informal"--
owners of water connections who distribute water to unconnected neighbors for
a fee. The vendor system is very efficient and is adjustable to serve new
settlements as they develop, but the cost of water to the consumer is much
higher than that of piped water. Thus, there is a problem of price, rather
than of availability of water, which is difficult to resolve economically,
particularly in view of the immigrant and not necessarily permanent nature of
the new settlements. The sector and organizational study included in the
proposed project would have as one of its objectives the formulation of future
policies for the transition from a purely growth-oriented water supply system
to one which would recognize social services to the poor while maintaining
financial viability. In the meantime the project would seek to implement
increased numbers of social connections for areas newly served under the
project and with a large poverty group, and to install a number of standpipes
as a temporary solution in these same areas at the rate of one per 400 persons
previously unserved.
50.       It is estimated that by 1990 the urban poverty group in Abidjan
(23 percent of total population) will consume about 10 percent of total
domestic consumption, at 30 liters per capita per day. Of the portion of the
loan allocated to Abidjan, about 5 percent, or US$1.2 million, represent funds
exclusively benefiting the poor. Lack of data on secondary centers makes
impossible a comparable estimate for them, but given that stand pipe water
consumption represents a larger proportion in the interior than in the
capital, it is expected that the relative impact of the project in the
secondary centers would be greater than in Abidjan.
Benefits and Risks
51.       The primary benefits of the proposed project would be the continuous
availability of high quality potable water in sufficient quantity to maintain
the present level of service for the fast-growing city of Abidjan, and the
expansion of service in secondary centers through better utilization of exist-
ing systems. The project would also contribute towards a more balanced pop-
ulation and income distribution between Abidjan and the interior over the next
decades. The project would help to satisfy water demand using the least cost
solution at reasonable capital cost per capita.



- 15 -
52.       Estimates of the rate of return of the project taking the consumer's
willingness to pay the existing tariff as the minimum proxy for total benefits
are 24 percent if the full tariff is considered and 14 percent if the tariff
exclusive of the surcharge for sewerage is used. These high rates of return
reflect the fact that the project is benefiting from large sunk costs in
well-developed systems. Sensitivity analysis on cost variations show that the
project's economic return is relatively insensitive towards changes within
normal testing boundaries.
53.       Unquantifiable but important benefits from the project include
health improvements resulting from increased consumption of clean water and
the effect of the project in improving infrastructure in the interior at a
faster pace than Abidjan, thereby reducing the relative attractiveness of the
capital to the population in the secondary centers.
54.       The proposed project does not present special risks.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Ivory Coast
and the Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. Special conditions of the project are listed
in Section III of Annex III. Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between
the Government and FNH, and provision of at least US$8.5 million to FNH as
counterpart funds for the project would be conditions of effectiveness of the
proposed Loan (para. 41).
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
57.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. Projects in Execution -
Ln. No. 981             Telecommunications Project:  US$25 million Loan of
May 3, 1974; Effectiveness Date: January 31, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The project has experienced a four-year slippage due initially to delays in
appointing engineering consultants and subsequently to management and organi-
zational deficiencies. After the Government awarded the contract for switching
equipment to other than the lowest evaluated bidder, the amount earmarked
under the loan to finance the equipment (US$7.6 million, including contin-
gencies) was cancelled as of March 31, 1977 (R77-128). A reorganization of
the Postal and Telecommunications Office took place in the Fall of 1981,
together with the appointment of competent managers. This important develop-
ment is expected to result in completion of the project by mid-1983. The
Closing Date of the loan has been amended accordingly.
LIn. No. 1069           Second Cocoa Project:  US$20 million Loan of January 10,
1975; Effectiveness Date: September 30, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1981.
Upon receipt and payment of the last disbursement application, to be sent to the
Bank momentarily, the outstanding amount of the loan will be cancelled and the
loan closed.
Ln. No. 1077            Cotton Areas Rural Development Project:  US$31 million
Loan of January 17, 1975; Effectiveness Date: June 4,
1975, Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
The project has been satisfactorily completed. Following processing of final
disbursement requests, the outstanding amount of the loan will be cancelled and
the loan closed.
Ln. No. 1124            Tourism Development Project:  US$9.7 million Loan of
June 11, 1975; Effectiveness Date: January 19, 1976;
Closing Date: September 30, 1982.
Project execution is progressing satisfactorily. Four hotels are opened and the
fifth is under construction. The loan has been fully committed.
/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors on the progress
of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems and
actions being taken to remedy them. They should be read with the under-
standing that they do not present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 1161            Fifth Highway Project:  US$43 million Loan of September 5,
1975; Effectiveness Date: November 4, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
The project has been satisfactorily completed. Upon receipt and payment of last
disbursement application, to be forwarded to the Bank momentarily, the out-
standing amount of the loan will be cancelled and the loan closed.
Ln. No. 1162            Small-Scale Enterprises Project:  US$5.6 million Loan of
September 5, 1975; Effectiveness Date: February 2, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Cancelling by CCI of a number of previously approved sub-projects has reduced
commitments on the line of credit from 100% to 91%. Disbursements stand at
73%. Given the availability of funds under the second line of credit (Ln. No.
1663-IVC), the uncommitted balance of this loan is being cancelled.
Ln. No. 1177            BIDI DFC Project:  US$8 million Loan of December 12,
1975; Effectiveness Date: September 17, 1976; Closing
Date: December 31, 1984.
The availability of less costly funds to BIDI in the past slowed down the
commitment of this line of credit. As the situation has changed during the
last year, however, the loan has now been fully committed.
Ln. No. 1347            Urban Development Project:  US$44 million.  Loans
and 1348-T              (US$30.0 million and US$14 million on Bank and Third
Window terms respectively) of December 15, 1976;
Effectiveness Date: March 9, 1978; Closing Date:
March 31, 1983.
The execution of the project is progressing satisfactorily. The transport,
trunk sewer, community facilities, technical assistance, and low-cost housing
components are completed. The upgrading component which suffered delays
because of administrative and legal procedures is now proceeding well and
would be completed by the end of 1982.
Ln. No. 1484            Secondary Centers Water Supply Project:  US$16 million
Loan of September 9, 1977; Effectiveness Date: June 9,
1978; Closing Date: September 30, 1982.
Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily on schedule.
Ln. No. 1501            Feeder Roads and Highway Maintenance Project:  US$29
million Loan of December 22, 1977; Effectiveness Date:
October 17, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Overall work progress is slower than anticipated, particularly as it relates to
works being carried out by the local contractor. Actions being taken by RMWA
are expected to speed up the implementation of the project which otherwise is
proceeding satisfactorily.

Ln. No. 1575            Second Grand Bereby Rubber Project:  US$20 million
Loan of June 9, 1978; Effectiveness Date: September 15,
1980; Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
Because of the establishment of a separate entity to manage the Grand Ber6by
rubber plantations (SO.G.B.), the structure of the legal documents for this
project had to be amended. Execution of the project, nevertheless, proceeded
satisfactorily under Bank staff supervision.  On July 17, 1980, the new agree-
ments to substitute for the original ones were submitted for approval to the
Executive Directors (R80-213) and signed on August 6, 1980. They became effec-
tive on September 15, 1980, and US$16.8 million have been disbursed to date.
Ln. No. 1577            Second Abidjan Sewerage and Drainage Project:  US$33
million Loan of June 9, 1978: Effectiveness Date:
September 14, 1979; Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily, although house connections to
the sewerage system are progressing at a slower pace than anticipated. Remedial
action in this respect is being discussed with Government.
Ln. No. 1633            SAPH Rubber Project:  US$7.6 million Loan of November 30,
1978; Effectiveness Date: October 2, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1984.
Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily. Smallholder rubber plantings
are ahead of schedule, although estate development is lagging, due to start-up
delays.
Ln. No. 1663            Artisans, Small- and Medium-Scale Enterprises Project:
US$12.6 million Loan of June 15, 1979; Effectiveness
Date: November 28, 1979; Closing Date: March 31, 1984.
Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily, although commitments and dis-
bursements are about six months behind schedule because of a slackening in demand
resulting from the overall lower investment activity in the country.
Ln. No. 1698            Second Tourism Development Project:  US$14.2 million;
Loan of June 15, 1979; Effectiveness Date: May 9, 1980;
Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily. Three large hotels are under
construction and nine small hotel sub-projects have been approved. Over 60%
of the loan amount has been committed.
Ln. No. 1735            Forestry Project:  US$18 million Loan of August 2, 1979;
Effectiveness Date: January 14, 1980; Closing Date:
December 31, 1985.
Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily. The 1980 plantation program
covering 4,000 ha was executed and plantations have been well maintained.
Subsequent plantations have been on schedule. All project provided staff have
now taken up their appointments.

Ln. No. 1777            Third Education Project:  US$24 million Loan of
December 28, 1979; Effectiveness Date: April 10, 1980;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
After initial delays of about one year due to the technical weakness of some
consultant architects and slowness in awarding civil works contracts, project
implementation is improving and most components are expected to be successfully
implemented. A sharp increase in disbursements is expected now that civil
works have started. The training of local staff and the preparation of equip-
ment procurement are well underway.
Ln. No. 1827            North-East Savannah Rural Development Project:  US$9.4
million Loan of May 27, 1980; Effectiveness Date:
December 22, 1980; Closing Date: September 30, 1985.
Project execution began well, but has not been progressing as smoothly during
the past year, owing to the difficulties involved in coordinating the various
actions called for by a number of institutions. The applied research program,
however, is proceeding satisfactorily and project progress is being closely
monitored.
Ln. No. 1896            First Power Project:  US$33 million Loan of September 11,
1980; Effectiveness Date: March 27, 1981; Closing Date:
December 31, 1986.
The studies under the project have been carried out on schedule. Physical
works, however, are delayed for about one year, due to the much longer than expected
time required for selection by CIDA and EECI of engineering consultants for the
project (including Bank financed components) and subsequent negotiations with
the consultants.
Ln. No. 1914            Highway Sector Project:  US$100.0 million Loan of
March 19, 1981; Effectiveness Date: July 31, 1981;
Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily, and the dialogue on sector policies
and issues is proving fruitful. Disbursements, however, during the first nine months
of implementation are slower than projected at the time of appraisal, but are now
expected to pick up considerably.
Ln. No. 2048 1/         Second Urban Development Project:  US$51.0 million Loan
of October 9, 1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1985.
Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily. Delays in finalizing the
subsidiary loan agreement between the Government of the Ivory Coast and SOTRA are
delaying the effectiveness of this loan. Nonetheless, invitation for tenders and
selection of consultants procedures are being carried out on schedule.
Not yet effective.

Ln. No. 2058            Structural Adjustment I:  US$150 million Loan of
December 3, 1981; Effectiveness Date: December 29,
1981; Closing Date: December 1, 1982.
The structural adjustment program is being carried out as scheduled. Dis-
bursements as of March 15 amount to $44.3 million. It is expected that the
first tranche of the loan ($100.0 m.) will be disbursed by June 1982. A mission
to review fulfillment of conditions for release of the second tranche is
scheduled for April/May 1982.
Ln. No. 2059            Technical Assistance project:  US$16.0 million Loan of
December 3, 1981; Effectiveness Date: December 29,
1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1985.
The project is being carried out satisfactorily. A number of positions have
been advertised, candidates are being reviewed, and it is expected that they
will be on the job as scheduled.
