INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO MAURITIUS
FOR THE DEVELOPNENT BANK OF MAURITIUS PROJECT
1.    I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed credit
to Mauritius for the equivalent of US$3.5 million on standard IDA terms to
help finance a project for the Development Bank of Mauritius (D3M).
2.    The proceeds of the credit would be relent to PDE with interest at 7.25
percent per annum and the repayment period would be a composite of the
repayment periods for various parts of the credit as explained in paragraph
44 below. A small portion of the credit would be made available to D3.I by
the Government as a grant to finance a feasibility study on the futare course
of the industrial estates program.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
3.    The most recent economic report distributed to Executive Directors was
dated February 10, 1971 (No. AZ-14a). An economic mission visited Mauritius
in December 1971 and is now preparing its report. A country data sheet is
attached as Annex II.
4.    Mauritius is a small island, densely populated and heavily dependent on
one crop, sugar. Literacy levels are high and the proportion of skilled
persons is higher than in many other developing countries. The main economic
problems facing Mauritius are the pressure of population and the stagnation
of the economy. During the last two decades there has been hardly any rise
in per capita income in real tenms.  The rate of population growth has
declined from 3.2 percent in the fifties to about 1.7 percent per year during
the last three years.  The previous high rate of growth, however, will lead to
a large and increasing number of people entering the labor force for many years
to come. The annual rate of increase of the labor force was 5,000 - 6,000 in the
last three years and is expected to exceed 9,000 in the next ten years. On the
other hand, there has been little growth in the number of new jobs created; over
20 percent of the labor force is currently unemployed. Avenues of escape from
unemployment are largely limited by a situation in which land is almost
completely utilized and there are almost no raw materials which could be used
for industry.
5.    The current economic Development Plan, 1972-75, focuses on employment
creation, with a target of full employment by 1980. It aims at creating
about 8,800 new jobs a year over the Plan period against 2,400 crsated annually
during the last three years, at raising GDP by about 7 percent a year against
2 percent annual growth during the previous three years, and at improving labor
productivity by 2.l4 percent a year compared with no increase during recent years.



-2-
6.    To produce a high rate of growth of GDP, in contrast to the stagnation
in the sixties, the Plan envisages a major structural change in the economy.
The share of agriculture, at present,about 25 percent of GDP, is projected to
decline to about 17 percent by the end of this decade. In contrast the share
of manufacture would rise from 15 percent to 23 percent of GDP. Tourism is
projected to grow rapidly and to reach 3 percent of GDP at the end of the
decade. Annual gross foreign exchange earnings from tourism are projected to
rise from about US$5 million in 1970 to roughly US$9 million in 1975.
7.   Mauritius has a great asset in its labor force which is capable of
carrying out precision worko Furthernore, wages are generally about one-third
of those in Hong Kong and Singaporeo In 1970,the Government therefore
ostablished an Export Processing Zone where imports of raw materials and semi-
finished goods could be farther processedo A number of tax incentives and
concessions are provided. The aim is to follow the example set by Hong Kong,
Singapore or Taiwan, The proposed IDA credit is specifically intended to
assist in the development of both industry and tourism.
8. The proposed transformation of the economy so as to increase the share of
manufacturing in the gross domestic product and employment is an appropriate
goal in the Mauritian conditionso However, it is likely to take a long time
for the benefits to reach a large number of people. Agriculture will continue
to be the main contributor to GDP and employment in the near future. Greater
emphasis is needed on increasing the productivity of smallholders in agriculture.
Small farm development increases productivity and incomes where the need is
greatest and contributes directly to improving the distribution of income.
This is particularly important because about 85 percent of the population eamn
incomes lower than the average per capita income, Furthermore, about 90
percent of the fanmers own only 19 percent of the land, in holdings averaging
only 1.4 acres, and their yields are notably lower than those achieved on the
large estateso Overhead irrigation, more credit and better agricultural
practices could raise their yields and incomes.
9.   The Plan projects an increase in sugar cane production of about 2 percent
a year. Sugar occupies about 94 percent of the arable land and contributes 93
percent to exports. Current sugar production in Mauritius is roughly equivalent
to the sum of the quotas set by the Comwmwealth Sugar Agreement, (CSA), the U.S.
Sugar Act and the International Sugar Agreement. Prices under the first two
agreements generally exceed the "free" market price. Recently there was a rise
of about 22 percent in the price of sugar sold under the CSA quota and a doubling
of the Mauritian quota under the U.S. Sugar Act. With world consumption of
sugar expected to rise faster than production in the near future, Mauritius'
target for sugar production seems reasonable. The main increase would come by
introducing a new high yield variety at the time of replanting, which usually
occurs once every eight years for larger estates but may be as infrequent as
once in twenty years for small farmerso As almost all arable land is under
cultivation, further increases in agricultaral output must come from crops
other than sugar, produced on land released from growing sugar. Progress so
far has been very slow and measures to diversify agriculture are yet to be
worked out.



10. Perhaps the most significant aspect of the Development Plan is its
emphasis on the creation of employment using labor intensive techniques
through the program of "Travail Pour Tous" (TPT) which is planned and
implemented by a public organization established last July: the Development
Works Corporation (DWC). The aim is to provide worthwhile employment
for some of the 32,000 registered unemployed in addition to some 17,000
relief workers. The relief workers are usually engaged in activities with
very low productivity, e.g. weeding at edges of roads. The objective is to
provide these relief workers with more productive work such as construction
of minor roads, building schools, clearing land for agriculture, layizig pipes
and replanting sugar with new higher yield varieties.
11. The target is to create 20,000 full-time jobs.     By the
end of 1971, about 4,000 persons were employed by the Development Works
Corporation. It has competent management and seems, at this stage
to be working effectively. Its viability depends particularly on its
ability to supervise workers in the field, to maintain, while using labor
intensive methods, a quality of work which is not inferior to that maintained by
traditional methods and to ensure that supplies are available in the right
amounts at the right time so that the flow of work will not slow down. At the
present time the DWC appears to have good control over workers and the
quality of work in buildings and roads appears to be satisfactory, although
there is need for improvement in land clearing works. According to preliminary
figures, the labor intensive methods used resulted in lower unit costs than
under traditional methods, particularly in construction of roads and schools,
without sacrificing quality. However, while the Corporation is accepting at
the moment any project presented to it, it would be beneficial to subject such
projects to a test of economic viability, particularly where alternatives are
available.  The Corporation will, however, have to be strengthened and expanded
to handle the much larger force of 20,000 workers as envisaged in the Plan.
12. Recent trends in savings have been encouraging. Gross domestic savings
averaged 21 percent of GDP in 1969 and 1970. This reflects good sugar crops
and a rise in international sugar prices. Since annual gross capital formation
remained at about US$25 million from 1967 to 1970, the effect was a rise in
foreign exchange reserves from about $24 million to $56 million in the same period.
While most of the savings were provided by the private sector, there has also
been a fall in recurrent expenditures which has enabled the Government to save
significant amounts during the past three years. In the future, however,
Govenmment savings may be reduced by a 12 percent wage increase which occurred
in December 1971, For the last four years the balance of payments has been in
surplus and reserves at the end of 1971 were expected to amount to 6 months of
imports. Since the price of sugar may well increase further, the Export
Processing Zone should soon begin to contribute to the balance of trade and
tourism is likely to grow, and the prospects for the balance of payments are
favorable.
13. Total investment over the four years of the Plan is expected to reach US$218
million, of which US$129 million would be in the public sector.   Public capital
inflow is expected to provide US$72 million to the public sector and the rest
of the Plan expenditures are expected to be met from domestic sources. The
Plan projects the United Kingdom to provide some 40 percent of public capital inflow



- 4 -
compared with about 90 percent for the last four years. France and
India are each expected to contribute about 6 percent. While the gross
public capital inflow required to carry out the Plan is high compared with
the US$17 million which Mauritius received during the comparable pro-Plan
period, the Government is discussing its needs with various dohors. In 1971
France established a penmanent aid mission in Hauritius.   The association of
Mauritius with the EEC, which is to be effective from 1973, means that some
aid should be available from the European Development Fund. If the favorable
trend in domestic savings continues and the inflow of external capital can
be sufficiently increased, the financing of the Plan should be possible.
lb. The most important factor upon which the success of the Plan depends, is the
country's capacity to increase investment; gross investment is to be almost
double and public capital fonmation to be almost treble the level achieved
in recent years. Such a rate of investment must be viewed against the
stagnation of investment during the sixties and the consistent underspending
in the public sector, where actual capital expenditure averaged about 70
percent of budget estimates. A shortage of design and engineering capacity
in the Ministry of Works and slow disbursement from available loans in the
recent past are further indications of constraints to project preparation and
implementation0 Most of the projects in the Plan are yet to be prepared.
The Government recognizes these constraints and is requesting a substantial
increase in external technical assistance. A Civil Service Commission is
expected to recommend ways and means to make the Government acdiinistration
more efficient and development oriented. However, the affect of these measures
will not be felt for some time and the constraints on absorptive capacity will
affect both the volume of foreign capital inflow and the rate of investment in
the next four years. The shortage of well prepared projects may alao limit the
amount of IDA commitments during the Plan period.
15. Service payments on external public debt were about 4 percent of foreign
exchange earnings in 1971 and assuming that most of the External borrowing
during the next few years is on concessionary terms, no major change in the debt
service ratio is likely. Although this debt service ratio is not high, poverty
and the uncertainties about future export earnings, which depend on sugar
prices and the development of new industries, combine to justify continued
support on IDA terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MAURITIUS
16. The Bank made a US$7 million loan to Mauritius for a power project in
1964., before the island gained its independence in 1968. This loan, guaranteed
by the United Kingdom, has been fully disbursed. The Bank Group's first
lending to Mauritius since independence was a US$5.2 million IDA credit in
April 1971 for the Tea Development Authority ProJect, which will help diversify
exports and reduce the economy's heavy dependenc'e on the export of sugar and
ease the severe unemployment. The revised total cost estimate (US$10.86 million)
amounts to a 54 percent increase over the estimate at the time of appraisal
mainly because' of increased costs of tea factories and labor and dollar
devaluation.  The Government has requested supplementary financing from the



British Government for the construction of tea factories, which were
originally to have been financed under the IDA credit. This component
costing an estimated US$2.9 million, would roughly correspond to the total
cost overrun. In other respects, the project is progressing satisfactorily,
though some rescheduling of land clearance may be necessary. The IFC made
a loan of US$600,000 for the construction of two hotels in June 1971. One
of them is already completed and the other is nearing completion. Annex I
contains a summary statement of the Bank loan, IDA credit and IFC investment
as of April 30, 1972, as well as notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
17.    In the light of the economic situation in Mauritius as explained in
Part I, future lending by the Bank Group will continue to emphasize employment
promotion, diversification and industrialization. Past operations and the
proposed project conform to this strategy. The Bank is currently assisting
the Government in preparing a regional development project, emphasizing
employment creation, which may lead to an IDA lending proposal in the coming
fiscal year. Depending upon the outcome of the feasibility study proposed under th
proposed DBM credit, financing an industrial estate may also be proposed. A
feasibility study financed by the United Kingdom is already underway to
prepare a project for the development of Port Louis Harbour to help promote
exports and industrialization. A feasibility study for a water supply and
sewerage project, also financed by the United Kingdom, will begin soon.
Inadequate water supply has been one of the main constraints on industrialization
and this project would help solve this problem. Both of these studies should
produce projects suitable for future IDA financing.
18.    The total amount of external public debt outstanding as of December 31,
1971 (including undisbursed debt) was US$h9.7 million, of which the IBRD loan
accounts for US$5.h million (about 11 percent) and the IDA credit, US$5.2
million (about 10 percent).
PART III - THE MANUFACTURING, TOURISM AND FINANCIAL SECTORS
The Manufacturing Sector
19.    In 1969 the manufacturing sector contributed about 15 percent to GDP and
10 percent to total employment. It was dominated by sugar milling and related
industries, which employed about half the workers in the manufacturing sector and
generated about 60 percent of the manufacturing value added. The manufacturing
industry is mostly in private hands. With the exception of sugar and tea,
Mauritius has practically no basic commodity to transform industrially,
Possibilities for import substitution industries, severely limited in any
event by the size of the domestic market, have been exploited during the sixties
and have now been almost exhausted.
20.    The major hope for industrialization now lies in the transformation of
imported raw materials and intermediate products for export markets. The
dlexterity and high quality of the Mauritius labor force and its low cost.
compared with competing countries is a considerable asset, particularly for
industries where value added is high and where labor cost constitutes a large
percentage of value added, such as manufacture of office machinery, transistors,
textiles, clothing, footwear and toys, or manufacture or assembly of



-6-
components Under sub-contracts.  Such goods should preferably haVe a
high value in relation to volume, since transport costs will be significant..
The authorities are encouraging cooperation between established manufacturers
abroad and local businessmen who have some entrepreneurial skill but
lack know-how and export marketing organization.
21.  Up to 1970, the Government's main means of stimulating industrial
development consisted of granting Development Certificates to entrepreneurs.
Development Certificates entitle the recipient to a five to eight year tax
holiday, import duty exemption on capital goods and protection against competing
imports through customs duties or quantitative restrictions. Since then,
a new Export Processing Zone has been established to attract export industries0
It offers more generous incentives mainly in the form of a ten to twenty year
tax holiday on retained earnings, a five-year tax holiday on dividends,
exemption from import duties on raw materials and capital goods, exemption
from certain obligations under the labor laws and guaranteed foreign exchange
for raw material imports and for repatriating profits and capital. The main
benefits from these incentives to Mauritius are in the creation of a number
of new jobs. The 'incentives have been successful in attracting industries
to the Export Processing Zone, but may need to be revised in the light of
experience.
22. The Export Processing Zone scheme has aroused considerable interest among
foreign investors. Eleven applications representing investment of over Rs 9.0
million and 1,170 new jobs were approved during the first year, and the
authorities had another 40 applications under consideration in January 1972.
The Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) has provided a total of Rs 2.1 million
to help finance six :of the eleven investments approved.
23. The Government also wishes to provide adequate infrastructure for industry.
Two hundred acres of land near the harbour at Port Louis are being reclaimed
and have been earmarked for a large industrial zone. As described in Part IV,
the Government also has an ambitious plan to build and lease industrial
estates, which'WBM began to implement four years ago.
The Tourism Sector
24. In tourism Mauritius has a distinct comparative advantage. It has
unspoiled, white sand beaches, coral reefs and lagoons, which are rich
in tropical fish and exotic shells. The temperature is subtropical and
pleasant with long daily periods of sunshine at the coast. The Plan target
is to raise the contribution of tourism to GDP from less than 1 percent in the
1967-1969 period to above 3 percent by 1980. The Plan estimates private
investment in hotels in the coming four years at Rs 30 million. Additional
employment in hotels and related services by 1975 is planned to increase by
960 from 630 in 1970 to 1,590 in 1975.
25. Recently there was a sharp rise in tourism. The number of visitors has
increased from 14,800 in 1967 to 27,700 in 1970, each staying ten days on the
average. The Plan proJects 50,000 tourists for 1975, an average annual increase
of about 15 percent.  This seems to be reasonable given recent growth trends,
26. The Government,estimates that value added in the hotel industry is about
60 percent of sales. The Government also estimates that, in the case of all-
inclusive or package tours where most of the growth in tourism is taking place,
allowing for revenues of overseas airlines, foreign tour operators, import costs
of supplies and services purchased by tourists and import component of the



-7-
depreciation costs of the fixed capital, the net foreign exchange earnings of
Mauritlus would amount to about one-quarter of the total expenditures of tourists.
27. As indicated in PartII, an IFC loan was made last year to help construct
two beach hotels, with combined capacity of 360 beds.
The Financial Sector
28. Mauritius has a well-developed commercial banking system. Of the six
commercial banks the Mauritius Commercial Bank is the only bank incorporated
and owned locally, the other five are branches of overseas banks. Although
some commercial banks and other financial institutions extend term-loans and
invest in equities, the amount of term financing provided by them has been
small in comparison to that provided by DBM.
29. The commercial bank prime rate is 7.5 percent per annum. The minimum
interest rate for medium-term loans is 8.5 percent per annumo Actual rates
can be up to 1.5 percent per annum above minima, depending on collateral.
Moneylenders charge from 9 percent up to about 20 percent per annum although
the legal maximum interest rate is 9 percent.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30. A report entitled "Appraisal of the Development Bank of Mauritius" (No,
DB-94a dated May 30, 1972) is being circulated separately.  A Credit and
Project Summary is provided in Annex III. The project was appraised in the
.field in Janaury 1972. Negotiations for the proposed IDA credit were held
in Washington in May 1972. The Mauritius delegation was headed by Mr, R.
Pyndiah, Financial Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Chairman of the Board
of DBM.
31. The proposed IDA credit of US$3.5 million would cover the import component
of DEM's investments in the two-year period up to mid-19740 Of this amount,
US$3 million would be for investments in industrial and tourism enterprises,
US$joo,o00 would be for a continuation of DBM's current rate of investment
in industrial estates for about one year and US$100,000 would meet the cost
of a feasibility study for a larger industrial estate program to be undertaken
in 1973. The proposed credit will help DBM, as the main source of long-term
finance for tourism and industry, which are the sectors expected to be the major
providers of new jobs, to further the two prime national objectives, diversificatiolL
of the economy and promotion of employnnto Moreover, most of the projects
financed by DBM are expected to be direct foreign exchange earners,
History and Objectives of DBM
32. DBM was established in 1964 as a statutory body to finance the development
of industry and tourism as well as the diversification of agriculture. It is
the successor to the Mauritius Agricultural Bank whose assets and liabilities
it took over.
33. A Bank mission led by Mr. Medhora, Deputy General Manager of the Industrial Credit
and Investment Corporation of India, in the capacity of consultants, visited DBM in



December 1969. As recommended by the Bank mission, DBM has been endowed
with share capital; a new General Manager, whom the World Bank Group helped
recruit, has been appointed; the Board has been strengthened; interest rates
for lending to industry%have been raised and DBM's policies and procedures
have been improved. As a result, DBM is now a suitable channel for IDA
financing.
Board of Directors
34. DBM's Board consists of twelve Directors, including representatives of
the Ministries of Finance, and Commerce and Industry and the Bank of Mauritius,
seven private businessmen amd DBM's General Manager. Board members are all
chosen by the Government. The Chairman is Mr. R. Pyndiah, Financial Secretary
of the Ministry of Finance. D*  M's Board seems to be reasonably independent
from the Government in its individual investment decisions.
Management and Staff
35. DBM's present Managing Director is Mr. D.V. Narasimhan who was Chief
Executive of the Madras Industrial Development Corporation Limited in India
for six years before joining DBM in May 1971.  He is competent sand experienced
in development banking. DEM has two operations departments, owe for industry
and tourism and another for agriculture. Between them they have eight
permanent Mauritian professionals. 'Staff members in the Industrial Department
received their training abroad while those in the Agricultural Department
received training at the Mauritius College of Agriculture* In 1971, the
Industrial Credit and Invesbment Corporation of India seconded a financing
officer for one year to help the Industrial Department in projec't appraisal.
DBM's management has obtained authorization to hire four new professionals
in the Industrial Department in the near future. According to the existing
D3M Ordinance, the Minister of Finance approves all staff appointments. It
was agreed during negotiations that DRM's Board should be given autonomy to
determine the size of staff and terms of employment. The amendment,'of the
Ordinance to this effect would be a condition of effectiveness of the Credit
Agreement.
Resources of DBM
36. DBM's total assets are of the order of Rs 60 million (about -US$12 'million).
Net worth, amounting to Rs 19 million at the end of the year ending
June 30, 1971, consisted of accumulated reserves of Rs 9 million and a share
capital of Rs 10 million, of which 80 percent is owned by the Government and
20 percent by the Bank of Mauritius (central: bank). D3E's liabilities on June
30, 1971 amounted to Rs 42 million, of which Rs 18 million -were securities
issued by the Mauritius Agricultural Bank and assumed by DBM in 1963 and Rs 17
million were long-tenm government loans. D1M as such has not issued any
securities to the public and has obtained virtually all its new resources from
the Goverrment.
Operations
370 DBM's Statement of General Policies includes adequate guidelines to be
followed by DBM in its equity and loan investments, and in its relations with



- 9-
the enterprises financed. In general, the policies contained in the Statement
are satisfactory. DBM's project appraisals are also generally satisfactory.
38. DBM's commitments in the past five years averaged slightly more than
Rs 6 million a year. Of these, 88 percent were for industry and tourism and
12 percent for agriculture. This is in accordance with the policy guidelines
given to DBM when it was established, that it should concentrate on
employment-creating industrial projects. DBM's assistance to industry and
tourism includes term-loans and equity investments to medium and large scale
industrial enterprises and to hotel projects and loans to small scale
entrepreneurs, and the construction of factory buildings and their rental to
entrepreneurs as part of Mauritius' efforts to promote its Export Processing
Zone Program. Slightly less than half the loans in the past five years to
agriculture were for diversification from sugar, and the remainder to sugar
growers mainly for refinancing prior debts.
39. Until November 1971 DBM's interest rates to industrial customers were,
as a matter of policy, lower than those charged by commercial banks, when
they were increased from 6.5 percent to 8.5 percent in line with market
interest rates. The interest rate charged to small-scale industries is 4.5
percent and to agriculture 6-7 percent. D3M's equity investments account for
about 25 percent of its commitments to industry and tourism over the past
five years.
400 As regards the industrial estate program, DBM has already built, or is
completing space for, about 60 factory units. Factory space is leased in
units, most of them 2,000 sq. ft. plus service areas, Utilities are also
provided. D3M's total investment in industrial estates is expected
to reach about Rs 4.2 million when buildings currently under
construction are completed, accounting for about 13 percent of DBM's total
commitments over the past five years. The Government plans caU for
expanding the number of factory units nearly five-fold over the next five
years. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that DBM would carry out
by mid-1973 a feasibility study for the proposed industrial estates
expansion employing consultants satisfactory to the Association and that pending
the outcome of the study D3M would limit its total investments in industrial
estates to a maximum of 15 percent of DBM's consolidated paid-up capital, free
reserves and subordinated government loans.
4l1  The Ordinance which created DBM empowers the Minister of Finance to give
DBM general policy directives0 Loans to small scale industry, refinancing of
prior agricultural debts and building and leasing of industrial estates are
carried out by DBM at the Government's request. DBM's Board of Directors may,
however, if it considers that such directives might prejudice DBM's financial
position, require that Government undertake to reimburse DBM any losses it
might incur in following such directives. This undertaking has already been
provided in the case of the loan program for small scale industries.
Financial Condition
42. DBM's financial condition is satisfactory. During negotiations it was
confirmed that the Government had subordinated its loans to DB4's other term
debt. The ratio of term debt to equity is 0.5:1, with the subordinated



- 10 -
Government loans being grouped with equity. During negotiations assurance
was obtained that DBM would limit this ratio to 3:1. The debt/equity ratio
should remain well below this maximum during the coming five years. DBM's
liquidity is satisfactory and as of June 30, 1971, current assets were
2.5 times current liabilities. During the fiscal year ending June 1971,
DBM's net profits were 2.1 percent of average assets; DBM's average financial
expenses amounted to 2.4 percent of average assets; administrative expenses
to 1.3 percent and gross income to 5.8 percent. In the long run, however,
DBM's creditworthiness may be adverse:ly affected by the programs which it
undertakes on behalf of the Government, although these programs constitute
only a small fraction of DBM's activities at present.  During negotiations
assurances were obtained that in order to protext DBM's financial position,
the Government would guarantee any further loans to refinance agricultural
debts, for which separate account would be kept by DBM, would continue to
guarantee loans to small scale industries and would meet the administrative
costs of this program.
Resource Requirements
4i3. Prospects for investment in industry and tourism in Mauritius are good.
Foreign investors, who are attracted by the abundant low cost ,high quality
manpower,are showing an increasing interest in establishing export-oriented
industries in Mauritius and in exploiting the tourism potential of the island.
DEM's total commitments over the two-year period ending June 30, 1974 are
projected at Rs 28.9 million ($5.7 million). Of this amount, Rs 23.2 million
is estimated to be committed for investment in industry and tourism, Rs 1.7
million for agriculture and small scale industry and Rs 4.0 million for
industrial estates. A significant increase in commitments for industry and
tourism is anticipated. In order to meet the foreign exchange component of
the above commitnents, IDA financing of Rs 1704 million (US$3.4 million) is
needed, while DE4 will make available from its own resources about Rs 11.5
million in local currency. The feasibility study for the industrial estates-
program will cost up to US$100O000 in foreign currency, making a total IDA
credit of $3.5 million      -
Onlending -Terms
44.   Except for the US$100,000 for the feasibility study, which would be made
available to DBM as a grant, the Government would relend the proceeds of
the credit to DBM under a subsidiary loan agreement. The interest rate would
be 7.25 percent per annum and the commitment charge would be 3/4 percent per
annum on the principal amounts not yet withdrawn. *DBM's repayment schedule
to the Government for the part of the credit used to finance industry and
tourism would conform substantially to the aggregate of the amortization
schedules applicable to the investment projects financed out of the proceeds
of the credit. DBM's individual investments in industry would be amortized
over a maximum period of 15 years including grace period. Tourism projects,
on the other hand, typically have a longer economic life, a higher proportion
of fixed costs, and more unstable revenues than industrial projects. For
tourism, therefore, individual investments would be amortized over a maximum
period of 20 years including grace period. DBM would repay the part .of the
credit used to finance industrial estates on a fixed amortization schedule over
a period of 20 years, given the relatively long life of industrial buildings.
Government would assume the exchange risk.



45.    A free limit of US$50,000 for individaal industrial and tourism
projects, and an aggregate free limit of US$750,000 are proposed. Based
on the size distribution of its present investments, the free limit will
require the approval by the Association of about 75 percent of the financing
provided by DBM under the credit and about 40 percent of the number of
projects.
PART VI - LGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHDRITY
46.    The draft Development Credit Agreement between Mauritius and the
Association, the draft Project Agreement between DBK and the Association, the
Recommendations of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) and
the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. The draft agreements conform to the
nomal pattern for credits for development finance company projects.
47.    I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - REC0MMENDATIONS
48.    I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTICK
Mauritius Tea Development Authority ProJect - 239-HAS
The revised total cost estimate (US$10.86 million) amounts to a 54 percent
increase over the appraisal estimate mainly because of increased costs of
factories, and labor, and the doIlar devaluation.  The Govenment has requested
supplementary financing from the British ODA. Field development is satisfactory
but clearing of land will need rescheduling over three years instead of two.
The area of land suitable for tea appeara slightly less than expected but
there is still a possibility that enou:h land will be found. The recalculated
economic rate of return has decreased from 15 percent to 12 percent.
