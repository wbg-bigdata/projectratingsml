REPORT AND RECOMYENDATION OF TIE PR'ESIDEFNT
TO TIE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO SOCIETE NATIONALE DES CIlEVININS DE FER ALGERIENS
FOR A RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Algeriens (SNCFA) with the guar-
antee of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for the equivalent of
US$49 million to help finance a railway project. The loan would have a term
of 20 years, including four years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Economic Development and Prospects of
Algeria" (155-AL) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 4, 1973.
An economic mission visited Algeria in April/May 1974 and is preparing its
report. A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        Following a period of adjustment after independence in 1962, the
Government has succeeded in creating political stability while pursuing a
strategy of pragmatic and vigorous economic and social development based on
centralized control of the economy, economic independence, rapid growth through
industrialization, rapid expansion of education and training, and a narrowing
of income disparities. Substantial progress has been made in alleviating the
two principal constraints to development - the instituitional vacuum and the
lack of technical and professional staff. The exploitation of oil reserves
and industrialization have played the primary role in development, while the
agricultural sector has lagged. Unemploymernt remains high, although there is
an acute shortage of skilled manpower. Policies of financial austerity and
equalizing distribution of income have been pursued, and emigration of workers
from the poorer areas to the cities and abroad have helped to narrow dispari-
ties of income between regions. However, discrepancies still exist, mainly
reflecting differences in resources and the level of economic development.
4.        With the nationalizations in the oil and gas sector in 1971 nearly
all foreign-owned enterprises have been brought under Algerian control. For-
eign capital is welcomed in the form of medium and long term loans, though
joint ventures are accepted in specific cases, e.g. as part of economic
cooperation with other Maghreb countries or when they offer technological
know-how or outlets to foreign markets. A major share of Algeria's invest-
ment effort has gone into basic industry - notably hydrocarbons, cast iron,
steel and chemicals - and into education. To narrow income disparities, the
Government has established wage and salary ceilings, minimum wage policies,
generous social security, free education, government transfers in the form
of veteran's pensions and price subsidies. Special regional development



-2-
program-s have also been stiried to narrow regional differences. Finally, an
agrarian reform began in 1971 whose ultimate aims are to redress asser t1is-
tribution and unlock productive potentials in the agricultural sector.
5.        The Government exercises economic and investment controls either
directly or through large state enterprises and "self-managed" modern farms
which dominate the various economic sectors. To relieve the shortages of
technical and managerial staff in most sectors, public spending on education
and training was raised to 10 percent of GDP, and innovative solutions were
found to the difficult problem of adapting the education and training system
to the needs of the economy. Extensive recourse was also made to external
technical assistance, and pretraining on the job was made a feature of proj-
ect contracts implemented by foreign firms. The Government and the state
enterprises greatly increased their capacity to implement development proj-
ects, particularly in the hydrocarbon and industrial sectors, although ac-
celerating investment implied cost overruns and initial operational ineffi-
ciencies. The Government now seems to realize the need for more efficient
use of investments, and is trying to introduce improvements in project eval-
uation, and some decentralization of decision making.
6.        During the First Four-Year Plan period (1970-73), preliminary data
indicate that GDP growth averaged 10.8 percent a year from 1969 to 1973 in
current prices. Domestic prices were strictly controlled, probably rising
by an average of about 3.5 percent per year. (There is no general price
index; industrial prices rose by 3.1 percent a year, and the cost of living
index in Algiers by an average of 4.7 percent per year.) Sharply rising in-
vestment and petroleum export earnings were the main sources of this growth.
Gross fixed investment rose from 28 percent of GDP in 1969 to 37 percent in
1973. Public investment, which accounted for about 85 percent of the total,
amounted to roughly $8 billion in the four-year period, and reached a level
of about $2.8 billion in 1973. Petroleum export earnings rose to an esti-
mated $1.5 billion in 1973 from $0.6 billion in 1969.
7.        The main emphasis of the 1970-73 Plan, besides education, was on
the hydrocarbon and industry sectors, which received the largest shares of
public investment (30 percent and 23 percent respectively). In the hydro-
carbon sector, public investment ($2.3 billion in 1970-73) enabled Algeria
to maintain an exploration program, to raise crude oil production from 48.2
million tons in 1970 to 50.8 million tons in 1973, increase petroleum refin-
ing capacity to more than 5 million tons at the end of 1973, expand trans-
port capacity and build up gas export capacity. Algeria also entered into
several long term contracts for gas deliveries to Europe and the USA which
are being negotiated and whicIh could result in export of about 80 billion
cubic meters in 1980. The hydrocarbon sector contributed 19 percent of GDP
and 83 percent of merchandise exports in 1973.
8.        In manufacturing, Algeria has followed a strategy of developing
heavy industries first; that is, petrochemicals, iron and steel and heavy
mechanical and electrical industries. Less investment has gone into other
manufacturing, such as food processing, consumer goods and construction ma-
terials. Manufacturing contributed 12 percent of GDP in 1973. Agriculture



- 3 -
has been stagnant and suffers from several structural problems.    Its share
in GDP was about 8 percent in 1972 and its share of public investment was
only 6 percent.   Output has hardly risen above the level at independence,
and agricultural exports declined as demand for wine weakened. Algeria's
large food deficit consequently increased; by the end of the Plan period,
it had to import 30 percent of its cereals renuirements and nearly all its
needs, in sugar, dairy products and edible oii. Concerned over the struc-
tural problems and the unfavorable trends, the Government gave increasecd
attention to the agricultural sector towards the end of the Plan, deciding
on a large program of conversion of vineyards, and introducing a program of
agrarian reform as well as increasing the supply of needed inputs. Invest-
ments in transport infrastructure, housing and health also seem to have
lagged behind the growing needs.
9.        Due to high capital intensity, investment and output growth did not
generate enough new employment opportunities to reduce significantly the high
rate of unemployment. Despite the relief provided by substantial emigration
to France (which has been stopped by Algeria recently), unemployment outside
agriculture was estimated at 25 percent of the related labor force in 1972
and agricultural underemployment at 40 to 50 percent according to official
statistics. However, these figures probably were overestimates, since they
included a number of people who either were not actively seeking employment.
The Government is giving increasing attention to the problems of rural areas
through regional development programs and through agrarian reform.
10.       The financing of sharply rising investments required a large in-
crease in national savings, which Algeria achieved through austere fiscal
and incomes policies. National savings attained nearly 30 percent of GNP
in 1973. This high percentage derived primarily from petroleum and related
revenues and also from the restraints put on public salaries and private pro-
fits. During the 1970-73 period, about 90 percent of investment was financed
by national savings. National savings were supplemented by rising external
borrowing mainly from commercial sources. Algeria's external debt was esti-
mated at $2.4 billion, including $1 billion undisbursed, at the end of 1972.
Borrowings from the Eurodollar market, which exceeded $1.3 billion in 1973,
and other borrowings may have raised the external debt to about $4 billion
(including undisbursed) at the end of 1973. External debt service had risen
to nearly $200 million, or 12 percent of exports and workers' remittances,
in 1972. It is expected to continue rising to over $500 million a year by
the mid seventies, but to represent less than 10 percent of export earnings,
due to the petroleum price rise. Gross foreign exchange reserves exceeded
$1.1 billion at the end of 1973, equal to about five months' imports of goods.
With the substantial oil price increases Algeria's capacity to service addi-
tional debt has been greatly enhanced.
11.       The economic growth prospects of Algeria in the medium term are
bright, given the large additions made to industrial capacity in recent years
and the considerably higher earnings expected from exports of oil, oil prod-
ucts and liquefied natural gas that can support further rises in the invest-
ment level. A considerably higher rate of GDP growth than in the past can



-4-
be expected.  The constraints on-  iiziagvri al anct ti'Clttii(4t sIkI I 1. w 1.1 * t'nl-
tinue to be strong despite rapid training. A secondl Four-Year Plan 1974-71
(involving $25 billion investment) is in final stages of consideration by
the Government. It will outline the Government's strategy for taking ad-
vantage of the additional development possibilities resulting from the rise
in petroleum prices, and is expected to continue to give particular attention
to industrialization and education, while putting increased emphasis on sec-
tors that had lagged heretofore such as agriculture, transportation, tele-
communication, health and housing.
12.       The export price of Algerian crude oil has risen from an estimated
$3.80 per barrel in 1973 to about $12 per barrel in early 1974, At this price,
petroleum exports could amount to about $5 billion in 1974, while Government
revenues could exceed $3.5 billion. (In 1973, petroleum exports amounted to
$1.5 billion with Government revenue of $1.1 billion.) Petroleum production
is not expected to increase rapidly, but gas exports will increase substan-
rially in the later years of the plan period, with a possible increase in
the price of gas. In these circumstances, and assuming that oil prices re-
main stable in real terms, it seems that Algeria will not face financial con-
straints in raising its already considerable rate of investment.    However, it
is not clear at present whether it will accumulate any significant financial
surplus or may still rLeed further capital inflow in the medium term, since
the result will depend, among other things, on the level of investment (in-
cluding reinvestment in the oil and gas sector); on policies regarding con-
sumption standards and on policies concerning accelerated repayment of short-
term debt. The possible accumulation of reserves will also depend partly on
the relative movement of prices between exported oil and imported equipment
and raw materials. The Second Plan should throw additional light on these
points and thus provide the basis for a firmer assessment of the balance be-
tween Algeria's financial requirements and resources over the medium term.
An economic mission to review the Plan is scheduled for later this year.
In the longer term, particularly as gas exports become significant in 1977/78,
as the savings capacity outside the oil sector expands, and if new oil re-
sources are exploited, Algeria's need for external capital should decrease
rapidly.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       In the period following independence, the Bank's relations with
Algeria were affected by the question of compensation for the nationaliza-
tion of foreign-owned banks, and insurance, commercial, manufacturing, mining
and oil companies. Settlements were progressively reached in the banking,
insurance and petroleum sectors, and the Bank has been informed that discus-
sions with industrial firms which began last year have been concluded satis-
factorily with most claimants. It is therefore considered that the compen-
sation issue does not present an obstacle to further Bank lending to Algeria.



-5-
14.       Lending to Algeria resumed in FY73 with two loans totalling $24.5
million, for education and transportation projects.    Annex II contains a sum-
mary statement of Bank loans as of December 31, 1973, and notes on the execu-
tion of ongoing projects. In addition to the proposed project, the FY74 lend-
ing program includes loans for port ($70 million) and power ($38.5 million)
projects which are being presented simultaneously. A Project Identification
Mission visited Algeria in April-May, in conjunction with the Economic Mission
to help identify and prepare projects suitable for future Bank financing, with-
in the framework of the 1974-77 Plan which is being finalized.
15.       The recent rise in the prices of oil will enable Algeria to further
raise its already high level of investment and to relax its austerity program
without running into balance of payments difficulties.    Thus, in the medium
term, the focus of Bank lending to Algeria will be on projects which help
substantially to enhance Algeria's capacity to maximize the returns from its
investments and spread the benefits of growth. This would be done by demon-
strating the value of thorough project preparation and by supporting, through
individual loans, the Government's efforts to increase the efficiency of eco-
nomic institutions. In this context substantial technical assistance may be
needed and requested by the Government; a joint Bank-IMF technical assistance
mission recently visited Algeria at the request of the Government to study
the financial planning system and to prepare a training program dealing with
various aspects of financial planning at the central, banking and project
levels. A further major aim of Bank lending would be to support the Govern-
ment's efforts in creating jobs to alleviate the need for emigration, and in
spreading the benefits of growth and development to the less developed rural
areas and outlying regions. This may be done by focussing on lending and
technical assistance in two specific areas: regional development and agrarian
reform. In my recent visit to Algeria, interest in the Bank's contribution to
these socially oriented programs was expressed by the Government. The future
lending program which is to be formulated for Algeria will be based upon a
Bank appraisal of the country's needs for financial and technical assistance,
taking into account the special advantages that cooperation with the Bank
can offer. Appraisals are currently scheduled for projects in education,
and industry: these two sectors, together with agriculture and general in-
frastructure, are likely to be the main areas of Bank involvement in Algeria.
PART III - TIliE TRANSPORT SECTOR
16.       At the time of independence in 1962, Algeria already had a well-
developed transport system particularly in the northern part of the country.
Excess capacity appeared because traffic growth slowed down initially after
independence. Since then, new investments were made mainly in connection
with new industrial projects, particularly in the gas and oil sectors, but
maintenance of existing facilities declined. Recently, however, the Govern-
ment re-emphasized transport infrastructure investments, and this is expected
to be reflected in the 1974-1977 Development Plan. The Bank's strategy in
the transportation sector is to support the improvement of existing infra-



- 6 -
structure together with carefully selected expansion projects, to seek
invcrovements in the efficiency of sector planning, and management, and to
provide technical assistance for the training of personnel. The main features
of the transDort sector (other tnan the railways which we discussed in the
context of the project) are set out in the following paragraphs.
17.       'ighways:  Algeria has an extensive highways network (about 79,000
kQ of classified roads), only 45 percent of which is paved.    About two-thirds
of total land transport vol-ume is carried by road.   Traffic growth, which was
over 10 percent Der year in 1968-1970, is expected to continue to expand at
this rate during the 1974-1977 Plan.   On average, vehicle density remains
relctively low (at ¾,000 average daily traffic (ADT), but with ADT ccunts
of abo-u 15,000 in the in6ustrial areas).   The traffic is largely concentrated
in the coastal area, reflecting the location of major industries,    A Ba2k loan
of $13.5 million (912-AL) was signed on June 19, 1973, to help finance roac
improvements and maintenance works.   The loan also includes technical assis-
tance to improve highway planning and coordinacion of such planning with
urban planning.
18,       Ports:  Algeria has five major commercial ports in which recent in-
ves2i:ents have been mainly for petroleum and ore traffic.   With recent traffic
increases the ports of Algiers and Annaba have become congested, and various
measures to improve port efficiency are being considered by the Government,
including new port facilities under construction or planned in the ports of
Skikda, Annaba, and Bethioua in connection with gas, oil, and phosphate ex-
ports and a steel mill development.   A proposed Bank loan to keep finance
construction of the port of Bethioua, mainly for the export of liquefied
natural gas (LNG), will be presented to the Executive Directors simultaneously
with this project.
19.       Pipelines:   The discovery of considerable reserves of oil and gas
and the development of oil exports from the Sahara has induced the creation
of an extensive network of pipelines from the fields to the export harbors
of Arzew, Bejaia and Skikda. Additional pipelines are to be constructed
primarily toward Arzew and Skikda to meet transport requirements generated
by contracts currently under negotiation for massive exports of LNG to the
United States and Western Europe. A $20.5 million Bank loan (378-AL) was
made in 1964 to help finance the first LNG plant in Arzew.
PAR? -V - TliEF PROJ,JECT
20.       A detailed description of the project is given in the report en-
titled "Appraisal of a Railway Project - Algeria", Report No. 330(a)-AL of
May 10, 1974, which is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.



- 7 -
21.       A project preappraisal mission visited Algeria in January/February
1973 and recommended urgent rehabilitation of track, modernization of enuip-
ment and some renewal of rolling stock. The project was appraised in October
1973 and negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington in April/
May 1974.   The Algerian delegation was headed by lr. M. Acufi, Secretary Gen-
eral of the Ministry of Finance and included Mr. Benmehdjouba, Director Gen-
eral of SNCFA.
The Railway: Management and Operations
22.       SNCFA is a state enterprise created in 1959 and its equity is -held
wholly by the Government; it operates under the overall supervision of the
Ministry of Transport and is managed by a Board of Directors and a General
Manager appointed by the Chairman of the Board, subject to the approval of
the Minister of Transportation.   There is a shortage of qualified staff
at the higher levels of management, but SNCFA is well aware of the problem
and is making use of technical assistance and consultants while training its
own staff.
23.       With 90 percent of Algeria's population in the mountainous northern
coastal region, which accounts for only 20 percent of the country's land area,
a dense network of roads and railways has developed to meet transport needs.
The railway network consists of 3,933 route km of track, of which 2,657
km are standard gauge and 1,276 are narrow gauge. The main network runs
from east to west, with links to Morocco and Tunisia, with a mineral line
in the eastern part of the country. The arrears in track renewal have
resulted in increased unit costs for track maintenance, damage to permanent
way and rolling stock, speed restrictions, derailments and an impairment of
overall efficiency.
24.       The backbone of the railway business is its bulk traffic hauling,
particularly iron ore and phosphate traffic on the 408 Ian mineral line, which
amounted to 50-60 percent of total railway traffic in the 1968-1972 period.
In the same period, total railway freight traffic increased by about 28
percent while road traffic increased by about 80 percent.    Demand outpaced
supply of railway freight services due to shortages in motive power and roll-
ing stock. The quality of passenger traffic is not very satisfactory, with
trains running late over 70 percent of the time; nevertheless, passenger
service expanded at an annual rate of 9 percent in the 1962-1971 period in
terms of passenger/km. The Government is considering using the railways for
mass transit of-suburban traffic in Algiers, Annaba, Oran and Constantine.
25.       It is expected that freight traffic will more than double between
1972 and"1977, with an average annual growth rate of between 15 and 17 percent
partly because many new basic industries, such as cement, steel and fertilizer,
are now reaching the production stage and will provide increasing volumes of
bulk traffic for the railways. The growth rate for passenger traffic is
assumed to be at 8 percent per anntm1, consistent with long-term growth trends.
However, continued passenger traffic growth can only be secured if the
quality of service is constantly improved.



Project Description
25.       The Investment Plan 1974-77:   The project forms part of the railway
development plan included in the 1974-77 National Devilopment Plan, which calls
for investments of about $464 million for both renewals of and increased capac-
f.v in rolling stock and track.   The railway development plan will be subject
to further evaluation with regard to certain capacity-increasing investments
and agreement was reached during negotiations that feasibilitv studies would
be prepared for major investrmients. A number of studies of SNCFA's operations
and management are to be undertaken as part of the project and SNCFA has
agreed to propose a plan of action on the basis of the recommendations of
the studies (Section 3.03 of the Loan Agreement); the plan of action is to
be implemented in accordance with the Guarantor's development plan and ins-
tructions. The Guarantor has agreed to exchange views with the Bank on the
plan of action (Section 3.02 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).    The Government
further agreed, as part of the cooperation between it and the Bank, to discuss
the recommendations of the studies with Bank.
27.       The principal items of the project are the complete renewal of 315
km of track, workshop equipment, tracl renewal equipment, completion of sig-
nalling,. telecommunications and station remodelling works, doubling or
realigrnment of sections of track in industrial areas, the procurement of
about 60 coaches, 25 railcars and 450 freight cars, the manufacture from
imported components of 200 freight cars, 110 ballast cars and 300 mineral
cars and the modernization of 25 coaches.
28.       Nine consulting studies are included in the project, of which eight
are included for financing from the proposedl loan. The first study, which
is being paid for by the Government, is for the detailed engineering of a
90 km section of line between El Gourzi and Ramdane Djamel.    The studies
included in the proposed loan are: (a) a feasibility study of a bypass for
the mineral line in the east; (b) a traffic costing and tariff reform study;
(c) a study of SNCFA's organization and administrative structure; (d) a study
of SNCFA's accounting system; (e) a study of SNCFA's supply and stocking
system; (f) a study of SNCFAts management infornation system; (g) a study of
SNCFA's maintenance and repair workshops for rolling stock and motive power
and (h) a study of the feasibility and establishment of a technical training
institute for SNCFA's middle management staff.    The foreign exchange cost of
these studies is $2.4 million.
Cost Estimates and Financing Arrangements
29.       Total project costs, including duties, taxes and contingency
allowances, are estimated at USS127 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of USS82.9 million equivalent. The proposed loan of
US$49 inillion would finance the full foreign exchange cost of the consultants'
services mentioned in paragraph 28, of rails, ties and fittings, and imported
freighn cars; and the foreign exchange component of locally assembled freight
cars, steels, workNsnops and equipment.  It would cover 59 percent of total
project foreign exchange requirements, the balance being provided by the
Government. The financing plan for the project is as follows:

US$ million
SNCFA:                             13.6
Government:

Long-term loans                 22.9
Proposed IBRD Loan:                49.0
Total                  127.3
Project Implementation
30.       SNCFA would be responsible for project implementation, including
track renewal and improvement works. It is to be noted that, as shown in
the table above, SNCFA will be reimbursed for the cost of track renewal by
the Government as, in Algeria, the railway's infrastructure (track, bridges,
tunnels and culverts) are the property of the State. SNCFA pays the Govern-
ment for the use of infrastructure through taxes.
Procurement and Disbursement
31.       All items under the proposed loan would be procured under inter-
national competitive bidding. Disbursements would be made on the basis of
100 percent of the cost of imported goods financed under the loan and the
full foreign exchange cost of consulting services. It should be noted that
the mineral and hopper ballast cars will be assembled locally, using components
imported under international competitive bidding. The cost of local assembly
will be borne by SNCFA. Disbursements are expected to begin in September
1974; the loan would be fully disbursed by June 1977. The Government has
asked that the proposed loan include $0.65 million of retroactive financing
for consulting services and this amount has been included in the cost of the
project. Any funds remaining in the Loan Account upon completion of the
project would be used in agreement with the Bank to finance the foreign ex-
change cost of other items in the Investment Plan or would be available for
cancellation.
Financial Situation
32.       Despite increasing operating costs and a static level of rates and
fares, SNCFA was able to cover its operating costs through increased traffic
and increased productivity per traffic unit. Projections through 1077 show
steadily improving results of operations after 1973. The working ratio 1/
1/   The ratio of operating expenses (including duties and taxes but exclud-
ing permanent way costs and renewals contribution) to total operating
revenues.



- 10 -
will improve from 82 in 1973 to 79 in 1977, while SNCFA's generation of
capital for its re-.ewals -und is expected to more than double from 21 million
dinars in 1973 to 58 m-illion dinars in 1977, thus affording the railways
greater flexibilitv in their renewal investment policy. It has been agreed
that SNCFA will mTaintain and improve the present working ratio.
33.       In the Algerian system of planning and financing, investments under-
taken by state-owned enterprises are subject to the approval of the Government
which also undertakes to provide the necessary investment funds, usually in
the form of debt.   In return, all surplus funds generated by the enterprises
revert to the State which bears the responsibility of the enterprises' debt
service if their own cash generation is not sufficient for the purpose.    More-
over, the Government may require the railways to undertake certain investrments
which may not be immediately viable, for instance, to help rural development.
For these reasons, the Government agreed (in Section 2.02' of the draft Guar-
antee Agreement) to provide SNCFA with such funds as may be necessary to meet
operating expenses in excess of revenues (if any), to provide SNCFA with suf-
ficient funds for the renewal oi its enuipment and to allow SNCFA to maintain
sufficient working cash balances.
34.       SNCFA's accounts are audited by the commissaire aux comptes in the
Ministry of Finance and this arrangement is satisfactory to the Bank. Internal
audit is restricted at present to checks of station accounts. An internal
audit unit is to be set up following the completion of studies by management

Economic Evaluation
35.       The future of the railways is closely linked to Algeria's continuing
efforts to industrialize as rapidly as possible. Each major plant and indus-
trial complex is served by rail sidings which allow the railway to transport
a substantial part of their production. Moreover, railway transportation
enjoys a cost advantage for medium to long distance hauls. Also, as passenger
service improves, it is expected to attract greater numbers of passengers and,
possibly, be utilized for mass transit in urban areas. The proposed loan
would assist in improving the efficiency of the railway system within the
overall transportation network, regardless of future investments in railways,
or of the result of a comprehensive review of planned railway investments.
Road/rail competition is not an issue in Algeria, with only ten percent of
railway traffic subject to road competition.
36.       SNCFA has prepared a 10-year program of track renewal and rolling
stock rehabilitation which should permit an increase in traffic levels from
2.5 million tons in 1972 to about 5 million tons on the main line (called
the Grande Rocade) and from 3.9 million tons to 6.5 million tons on the
mineral line.   This increase in traffic appears to be consistent with
Algeria's overall development objectives and it is within this framework
tnat the economic evaluation of the project has been prepared.    While it
is not possible to attribute spec-i-AFic benefits to any particular item of
the renewal program because the proposed investments are closely inter-
related and the achievement of maximum benefits depends on their coordi-
nated and parallel implemeritation, the renewal program is not a marginal



- 11 -
increment to an already efficient operation, but is meant to safeguard a
system that would otherwise deteriorate rapidly as a major transport mode
if the investments were not made.
37.       Thus the economic evaluation of the project is based on a "with"
and "without" choice. Track on the main line is, on the average, about 30
years old; without the project the system would be subject to further deter-
ioration and ultimate collapse. The most likely economic rate of return on
the project improvements is return of about 21 percent for the main line.
The mineral line is already used to near capacity and further deterioration
would lead to its closure in one or two years; safety reasons have already
compelled the withdrawal of a substantial part of passenger service on this
line. If the line were closed, mining operations would have to be abandoned
as there is no alternative form of transportation to move iron ore and phos-
phates.   The economic return from keeping the line in operation through ade-
quate maintenance and renewal of track and equipment as well as through the
provision of new rolling stock would be about 23 percent. Sensitive factors
affecting the rate of return of the renewal program are investments costs
and traffic growth. For the main line, a sensitivity analysis showed that if
investments costs were to increase by 10 percent and traffic growth to decrease
by 25 percent, the rate of return would still be 18 percent. On the mineral
line, a 10 percent increase in cost would reduce the economic rate of return
from 23 percent to 20 percent.
38.       As the project is mainly for the renewal of existing track and for
the purchase of rolling stock, its impact on the ecology is negligible. None
of the project components are direct causes of pollution.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AIJTHORITY
39.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Societe Nationale
des Chemins de Fer Algeriens, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the
Democratic and Popular Rublic of Algeria and the Bank, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
40.       Sections of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements of special interest
are referred to in paragraphs 26 and 33. In other respects, the draft agree-
ments conform to the normal pattern for railway projects.
41.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
42.       In formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to take full
account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices. However,
available information indicates that the proposed loan remains fully justified.
43.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Ln. No. 912     Highway Projects; US$18.5 million Loan of June 19. 1973.
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Improvement and construction works started on time; the quality of
work is good and supervision of works by the Ministry of Public Works is satis-
factory. The appointment of consultants has been delayed by several months.
However, the coordinating consultants, who will also carry out the highway
maintenance study, have now been appointed and a selection of the consultants
for feasibility studies in progress. The possibility of regaining part of
the time lost was investigated by a supervision mission which visited Algiers
in April. No disbursements from the loan account have yet been made. The
Government has recently submitted disbursement requests for the construction
works.
Ln. No. 913     Education Project; US$6.0 million Loan of June 19, 1973.
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Under the technical assistance program, the Bank approved on March
22, 1974, the recommended short list comprising three international firms for
the pre-investment study for the Institute of Light Industry. No disburse-
