REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A
NATIONAL FOOD CROPS EXTENSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of $22 million to
help finance a national food crops extension project. The loan would
have a term of 25 years, including 6 years of grace with interest at 8-1/2
percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report on Indonesia "Indonesia:  Development
Prospects and Needs" of' April 15, 1975 (708-IND) described and analyzed
the structure of production and incomes, the recent changes in the avail-
ability of resources, and the medium and longer-term outlook for the
Indonesian economy. Country data are shown in Annex 1.
3.        In 1969, at the start of Indonesia's First Five-Year Plan, the
per capita income of the Indonesian population was probably no higher than
half a century ago. A majority of the population lived below a minimum
welfare standard, especially on Java. Most were dependent exclusively or
primarily on agriculture, and farms were generally very small. Under-
employment was widespread. While the inflation of the mid-1960s had been
overcome, infrastructure was still in a very poor condition.
4.        The Governmeiit's efforts during the First Five-Year Plan period
(April 1, 1969 - March 31, 1974) were successful in putting the economy
on the development path. Most physical objectives were achieved or nearly
so, and there was substantial rehabilitation of run-down infrastructure
and Government enterpr-ises in agriculture and manufacturing. Foodgrain
production increased by 4 million tons during the Plan period at an average
rate of 5 percent per annum. Investments increased at a very fast rate,
rising from 9 to 19 percent of GNP. The reliance on foreign financing of
Government development expenditures was much smaller (57 percent) than the
rate of nearly 80 percent foreseen in the Plan. GDP increased at an annual
rate of over 7 percent. GNP per capita, in current prices, reached about
$130 1/ in 1973. The Government instituted programs for the labor intensive

rehabilitation of infrastructure and other programs which created substantial
incomes and employment. In all, however, given the annual increase in the
labor force of about one million, one cannot be confident that the employment
situation improved during the First Plan period, and it is difficult to judge
from available information the extent to which the poorest sections of the
population shared in the gains of development.
5.        The Second Five-Year Plan (April 1, 1974 - March 31, 1979) builds
on the achievements of the First Plan. While the First Plan dealt mainly
with the urgent needs for stabilization and rehabilitation under conditions
of great scarcity of resources, progress had been such that the Second
Plan could give much more attention to such problems as employment, equitable
distribution, regional growth, health and education. The Plan identifies a
number of specific low-income target groups and, in general, adopts an employ-
ment oriented development strategy. It aims at a continued growth in invest-
ments, needed both because capital intensity will tend to increase as the
rehabilitation phase draws to an end, and because more socially-oriented
investments will be made. Overall, the Plan expects GDP to grow at 7.5
percent per annum.
6.        Over the decade 1961-71, Indonesia's population grew by 2.1 percent
a year. However, as a result of changes in the age distribution and declining
mortality, the current annual growth rate is estimated at 2.5 percent. Even
under the most optimistic assumptions with regard to fertility decline, the
growth rate would only come down gradually, and the population would nearly
double by the end of the century. While Indonesia still has substantial
unutilized land reserves in the Outer Islands, these are limited in relation
to the expected population increase, and a further large increase in popula-
tion pressure - already severe on the Inner Islands - must be expected.
Since 1969, the Government has been operating and gradually extending a
family planning program. The number of acceptors has been increasing rapidly.
The Second Five-Year Plan foresees a progressively more vigorous and compre-
hensive attack on the population problem.
7.        During the years 1976-79, average annual additions to the labor force
are estimated at 1.2 million, increasing to more than 1.4 million in the years
1980-85. In addition, substantial underemployment exists, and there is the
risk that even relatively simple technological improvements may adversely
affect existing employment. The Second Plan's projections show that employment
growth would almost keep up with the growth in the labor force but even this
may prove optimistic. Thus, the employment thrust of the Plan needs to be
further strengthened if an appreciable increase in real labor earnings - and a
wider spread of the benefits of development - is to be attained.
8.        Towards the end of 1973, when the Second Plan was being finalized,
prospects for resource availability improved dramatically. In line with other
OPEC countries, the Government raised the export price of oil in successive
stages from $3.70 per barrel in April 1973 to $12.60 per barrel in July 1974.
Early in 1974 (and again in 1975) the Government successfully renegotiated the
contracts with foreign oil companies, enabling it to retain a greater share of



- 3 -
the oil income. As a result, the net contribution of the oil sector to the
balance of payments and Government revenues was expected to increase very
considerably; a large increase in foreign exchange reserves and a budget
surplus were also anticipated for 1974/75 1/.
9.        By October 1974, foreign exchange reserves had risen by $650 mil-
lion from about $1 billion at the beginning of 1974/75 and Government revenues
exceeded the levels originally estimated. The Government authorized much
higher levels of experLditures, mainly for development, which reflected the
improved revenue prospects. However, the recessionary conditions in the in-
dustrial countries began to affect the volume of oil exports and production by
the middle of the year. Indonesia's low-sulphur oil tended to become over-
priced 2/ as world oil demand slackened and output declined from an average of
1.45 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 1974 to 1.31 million
bpd in the second hallf. Proceeds from non-oil exports also started to decline
as prices, and in some cases export quantities, fell.
10.       In October L974 also, the first signs appeared of what turned out to
be a substantial financial overextension by PERTAMINA, the national oil compa-
ny. PERTAMINA had undertaken a large and diversified investment program fi-
nanced to a substantial extent by short-term borrowing. In the third quarter
of 1974/75 it started withholding part of the corporate oil tax it had
collected on behalf oE Government from the foreign oil companies; by the end
of the fiscal year a total of Rp 346 billion ($830 million) had been so
withheld and used to ineet PERTAMINA's financial obligations. Early in 1975,
PERTAMINA failed to meet payments due to some foreign banks, and the Govern-
ment stepped in and tDok decisive action. It banned all independent foreign
borrowing by PERTAMINA and other Government enterprises and gave Bank Indonesia
the sole authority to contract foreign obligations, instructed Bank Indonesia
to provide the funds needed to meet PERTAMINA's external obligations, under-
took a comprehensive review of the oil company's investment projects and began
the process of reducing and re-planning the company's investment program and
of cancelling and renegotiating many of the related procurement contracts.
11.       The combination, in the latter half of 1974/75, of slackening re-
ceipts from exports of oil and other products, and of the need to meet
PERTAMINA's short term obligations resulted in a loss of the foreign exchange
reserves gained in the first half of the fiscal year; by March 31, 1975,
these reserves were at the same level as at the beginning of April 1974.
12.       In the first half of 1975/76, Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves
declined by a further $480 million, despite substantial capital inflows,
1/   Indonesian fiscal year April 1, 1974 - March 31, 1975.
2/   The premium on Indonesian oil has recently been reduced by the Govern-
ment's decision to raise the price of its main crude by 1.5 percent (to
$12.80) as compared with the 10 percent increase in the price of Saudi
Arabian light crude agreed at the meeting of OPEC in September 1975.

which included two syndicated public cash borrowings (totalling $575 million)
from the international capital market. With continuing recessionary con-
ditions in Indonesia's principal markets, exports failed to increase while
imports rose again (about 30% on an annual basis). Debt service payments on
behalf of PERTAMINA were also very large (about $1.0 billion). In the second
half of 1975/76, there was no appreciable change in export earnings, but
imports and debt service payments were lower and there was only a small re-
duction in capital inflows (two more cash loans, amounting to $475 million,
were raised). The country's foreign exchange reserve position was therefore
relatively stable in this period and the decline in the reserves for the
year as a whole amounted to nearly $500 million.
13.       Balance of payments prospects for 1976/77 are on the whole good.
Recovery from the recession appears to be underway in most industrialized
countries, commodity prices seem to have bottomed out and oil exports from
Indonesia have been rising in recent months. The Government is in the process
of negotiating an increase in its share of the oil income. Rice imports are
expected to remain at the average level of recent years (Government estimate
is 1.4 million tons) but prices are likely to be considerably lower. The
country has sizeable stocks of fertilizer and only small amounts are expected
to be imported. However, there remains some uncertainty as to the exact
magnitude of payments due on account of PERTAMINA's financial obligations,
and the outcome for foreign exchange reserves during 1976/77 is difficult to
predict at this point.             -
14.       Budgetary revenues in 1974/75 were much lower than had been anti-
cipated at the middle of the year, partly due to the withholding of oil tax
revenues by PERTAMINA and partly to the shortfall in oil exports in the
second half of the year. The budget was however, still in balance by year's
end as the Government reduced or deferred expenditures. The Government re-
venue in 1975/76 also fell substantially short of the budget estimates, main-
ly as a result of lower oil tax revenue. To keep the budget balanced, both
current and development expenditures were reduced. Revenues, as well as
current and domestically financed development expenditures, are now esti-
mated to have been roughly 15 percent lower than originally budgeted.
15.       In spite of the shortfall in budgetary revenues, and the adminis-
trative difficulties involved in the implementation of some projects, total
development expenditures in 1974/75 were Rp 770 billion ($1.9 billion), about
60 percent higher than the level in the previous year. In 1975/76 they are
estimated at Rp 1.27 trillion ($3.1 billion), including foreign project
financing totalling about $925 million and fertilizer subsidies amounting to
$320 million. This is more than two and one-half times the actual expenditure
in 1973/74; when adjusted for price changes it represents an increase of
about 60 percent.
16.       Preliminary figures indicate that the high growth rate achieved
during 1969-1973 was maintained in 1974. In constant 1973 prices, gross
domestic product rose by 7.5 percent in 1974. Partial indicators seem to
point to slower growth of output in 1975. The inflation rate was very high
in the first part of 1974 as, among other factors, world inflation was trans-
mitted through both export and import channels, but abated somewhat later in



- 5 -
the year, partly as a result of the Government's stabilization measures in
April 1974. Nevertheless, for the year as a whole it reached 40 percent.
While still considerable, the average inflation rate for 1975 was reduced to
20 percent.
17.       In the afternath of the PERTAMINA development, the Government is
faced with problems which, although serious, are surmountable. The review of
PERTAMINA's projects has resulted in the cancellation or renegotiation of
many contracts and reductions in project scope and size. 1/ The Government
has more recently undertaken a broader review of projects initiated by
various Government departments and other State entities in an effort to
bring future expenditures in line with available resources and the priorities
set out in the Second Plan. It is screening very carefully any major new
programs or projects, since considerable resources will be needed in the
next year or two for the completion of projects already initiated.
18.       The recent financial difficulties will have a longer-term effect
on the country's external public debt service obligations during the rest
of the decade. Debt service payments over the next several years will be
much larger than previously envisaged as a result of the large borrowings by
the Government in the last fiscal year. Debt service in 1976/77 is now
estimated at $700 million, which would be about 12 percent of the value
of officially projected net oil and other exports.    Debt service payments
on all loans contracted up to December 31, 1975 may reach about one billion
dollars by 1978, before declining as shorter-term maturities are paid off.
This is about $500 million more per year than the payments projected on the
basis of debt outstanding at the end of 1974. With debt service obligations
from these borrowings substantially higher than expected earlier (about
13 percent of exports in 1978), the margin for further borrowing on other
than semi-concessional terms has now become much more limited. The amounts,
terms and purposes of future borrowing therefore need to be kept: under con-
tinuous and careful review.
19.       While the recent balance of payments and budgetary difficulties
have upset some of the Government's plans, the long-term prospects for
Indonesia's development remain good. The country has a substantial poten-
tial for further productive investment, employment and income growth. In
agriculture a vigorous pursuit of on-going programs in irrigation, develop-
ment of new plant varieties and technical services, provision of credit
and current inputs, etc., promises to yield high returns. In addition,
there are opportunities for the development of new areas, of food and plant-
ation crops - partly in conjunction with a rapidly growing transmigration
program. The industrial potential is good, both for modern capital in-
tensive natural resource-based activities and for more labor-intensive,
partly export-oriented industries.
1/   The planned capacity of the Krakatau Steel plant for example was re-
duced from 2,000,000 to 500,000 tons per year and the existing supply
contracts were reduced by $750 million.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
20.       Part I of this Report emphasized Indonesia's plans for and need
to undertake a large investment and development program designed to provide
productive work opportunities (with resultant increased incomes) for its pre-
sently underemployed and growing labor force. Substantial external financing,
the larger part on concessional and semi-concessional terms, as well as a con-
siderable volume of technical assistance, is also required. The Bank is plan-
ning to maintain its lending to Indonesia at present levels and in particular
to support projects designed to: improve agricultural credit, research and
extension; rehabilitate and expand irrigation systems; improve nutritional
levels; assist transmigration and other land development in the Outer Islands
for and by smallholders; increase non-agricultural employment in the rural
areas and small towns, through the establishment of small-scale industries;
rehabilitate and expand urgently needed transportation and other infrastruc-
ture; assist urban development and the national family planning program.
21.       As of May 15, 1976, Indonesia had received 37 IDA credits total-
ling $561.8 million and thirteen Bank loans amounting to $682 million. At
that date, IFC investments totalled $58.4 million. At the end of 1974 the
Bank accounted for about 4 percent of Indonesia's total (disbursed)
outstanding public debt; by 1978 it is expected to account for 12 percent
of total outstanding debt and 5 percent of public debt service obligations.
The Bank has in the past financed some of the local costs of projects in
Indonesia. A limited amount of such financing will continue to be necessary
in connection with Bank assistance to the agriculture and social sectors,
where projects frequently have a low foreign exchange component. A summary
statement of IDA Credits, Bank Loans and IFC Investments as of March 31, 1976,
as well as notes on the execution of ongoing projects are contained in Annex II.
This loan and the proposed seventh irrigation project are the eighth and ninth
loans proposed for Indonesia this year and if approved would bring total IBRD
commitments since June 30, 1975 to $517 million.
22.       To date, agriculture accounts for just over one-third of all
Bank lending to Indonesia, including four IDA credits for estate rehabili-
tation, six for the rehabilitation and expansion of irrigation systems, two
for fisheries, and one each for seeds, beef cattle, sugar and smallholder tea
and rubber. In the industrial sector, the Bank Group has assisted in three
projects to expand PUSRI's fertilizer production and distribution capacity,
three for development finance companies (Government-owned and private) which
play a major role in fostering the growth of industrial enterprises, and one
for the Pulo Gadung industrial estate. Loans and credits have also been
extended to the transportation, education, telecommunications, tourism, power,
population, urbanization and water supply sectors; one loan for a national
resource survey and mapping project; and four credits for technical assistance
to aid the Government in preparing and formulating its development programs
and projects.
23.       Bank lending to Indonesia started with an IDA Credit in 1968 for
irrigation rehabilitation; almost half of all loans and credits have been made



- 7 -
since mid-1972, with lending on Bank terms commencing in June 1974. Disburse-
ments on loans and credits are now at satisfactory levels. The Indonesian
authorities have become increasingly aware of the delays in project execution
caused by cumbersome procedures and the need to establish an effective control
system in BAPPENAS (the National Development Planning Agency). At the
Government's request, the Bank has arranged for assistance under the Fourth
Technical Assistance Credit (Cr. 451-IND) to help set up a monitoring and
control system which it is hoped will lead to better project administration.
24.       Future Bank lending gives high priority to the agricultural sector
through support of projects to increase rice and other crop production in the
Inner and Outer Islandls, and the expansion of resettlement efforts on the
latter. In addition, the program provides for further socially oriented
projects in the fields of urban development and population. Projects for
ports, sugar, transmigration, urban development and nutrition are expected
to be ready for presentation in the next few months.
PART III - AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
25.       Indonesia's economy is predominantly rural, with agriculture
accounting for about 40 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), two-
thirds of employment and almost 80 percent of non-oil exports. In agri-
culture, the single most important objective of the First Five-Year Plan
was for increased rice production through rehabilitation and construction of
irrigation systems and a major expansion of the existing schemes for supply of
current inputs and credits to farmers (the BIMAS and INMAS programs).
26.       Indonesian agriculture has a dual structure consisting of 13-18
million smallholders and about 1,200 large estates. With the exception of oil
palm, smallholders dominate Indonesian agriculture in the production of all
subsistence and cash crops. On Java, Madura and Bali, where population
pressure is especially intense and irrigation most extensive, the efforts of
smallholders are heavily concentrated on the production of rice and other food
crops. In the Outer Islands, particularly Sumatera and Sulawesi, smallholder
production is primarily devoted to export crops, mainly rubber and coconuts.
Productivity in the case of most smallholder crops is low, largely because of
inadequate supporting agricultural services (mainly credit, supply of inputs
and extension) and marketing channels.
Agricultural Extension
27.       Originally, agricultural extension services in Indonesia were pro-
vided by five separat:e Directorates General within the Ministry of Agricul-
ture (MOA) -- Food Crops, Estate Crops, Animal Husbandry, Forestry, and
Fisheries. In 1974 t:he Government reorganized the Ministry by removing
the research functions and responsibilities for extension methodology from
the Directorates General and placing them in two new agencies: (i) the
Agency for Research and Development (ARD), responsible for all agricultural



- 8 -
research and development at the national level; and (ii) the Agency for
Education, Training and Extension (AETE), with responsibility for agricul-
tural education and training and for extension methodology. The five Direc-
torates General, however, retained responsibility for the administration of
extension services in the Provinces.
28.       The Directorate General for Food Crops Agriculture (DGFCA), as a
result of the BIMAS program, has the largest number of extension workers and
provides the bulk of the extension service in the provinces. The Director
General of DGFCA is concurrently executive head of the BIMAS Secretariat in
MOA. He is assisted in planning and coordination of the program by the
National BIMAS Committee, consisting of representatives of all participating
Government agencies. Similar committees function at the provincial and dis-
trict levels under the chairmanship of the Governor and Bupati, respectively.
In early 1976 the staff of this Directorate General included nearly 240 Sub-
ject Matter Specialists, 50 middle level extension workers (PPM) and almost
4,200 field extension workers. The overall ratio of field extension workers
to farm families is about 1:3,300, but because of their regulatory and adminis-
trative duties, the actual ratio is closer to 1:4,500.
29.       Extension staff of the different Directorates General at the Pro-
vincial, district and sub-district levels are administratively part of the
local government structure, but are supervised and backed up on technical
matters by their respective Directorates General. Field extension workers
and Subject Matter Specialists are initially appointed under the BIMAS
agricultural support program, which provides credits for subsidized inputs
and a cash allowance, together with extension advice to eligible farmers.
30.       The extension services, operated by the Directorates General, are
semi-autonomous and consequently there are variations in the mode of opera-
tion between Provinces. Coordination between the Directorates General at
Provincial and District levels has improved recently with the appointment of
Provincial Agricultural Coordinators who coordinate the work of the different
agricultural agencies in the provinces. The Coordinators are responsible to
both the Governor and the Minister of Agriculture.
31.       There is still considerable scope for increased productivity in
agriculture even without an increase in the use of complementary inputs.
The project is based on the premise that even if inputs other than technical
advice remain static, it is still possible to increase productivity. With
the likelihood of other government sponsored programs providing additional
services and inputs to the farmers, the need for an improved extension
service becomes more acute. To be fully effective for all food crops and
farm holdings, provincial extension activities must be intensified and stream-
lined, the number of extension personnel must be increased, training activi-
ties intensified and extension methodology improved. The proposed project
would help achieve these objectives.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
32.       A special project preparation team within the Agency for Education,
Training and Extension (AETE) of MOA prepared the project, with assistance
from the Bank and the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. The project was appraised
in August 1975 and a post-appraisal mission visited Indonesia in February 1976
to incorporate into the appraisal report the Government's decision to limit
the project initially to food crops only. Negotiations were held in Washing-
ton from April 13 to 16, 1976. The Government's negotiating team was led by
Mr. Achmad Affandi, Director General of Food Crops Agriculture/Executive
Secretary of the BIMAS Program, Ministry of Agriculture. An appraisal report
is being circulated to the Executive Directors separately, and a loan and
project summary is at ALnnex III.
Project Description
33.       The proposed project would strengthen the existing provincial ex-
tension services for all food crops in nine provinces: West, Central and
East Java; Jogyakarta; North, West and South Sumatera; South Sulawesi; and
South Kalimantan. The provinces were selected because of their importance
in the production of food crops.
34.       The project would provide for:
(a) An increase in the number of extension staff;
(b) An extensive program of local training for exten-
sion workers along with a limited number of
fellowships and overseas training tours;
(c) Introduction of a sound extension methodology with
emphasis on continuous training and regular farm
visits;
(d) Construction or renovation of 529 Rural Extension
Centers (REC's) and the construction of a project
headquarters;
(e) Employment of a local firm of architects, an
extension specialist and about 50 man-months
of short-term specialists;
(f) Provision of necessary vehicles and equipment; and
(g) Extension of the IRRI (International Institute of
Rice Research) contract which is presently financed
under Cr. 246-IND.

Project Organization
35.       National Level.   Overall responsibility for the project would rest
with the Director General Food Crops Agriculture (DGFCA), while a Project
Director to be appointed by the Director General, would be responsible for
day-to-day activities and for coordinating the project with extension activi-
ties of the other Directorates General, other agencies within MOA and with
the BIMAS Secretariat. The Project Director would have a small staff and
would be assisted by an extension consultant and a local firm of architects.
He would also act as secretary of the National Food Crops Extension Advisory
Working group which would plan extension activities under the project and
would be composed of the Director General of DGFCA (as chairman) and the
Secretary and Director of Planning of DGFCA, two representatives from BIMAS
and one from AETE and the Inspectors of Agriculture of the nine participating
Provinces. The appointment of the Project Director would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan (Section 6.01 (a) of the draft Loan
Agreement).
36.       Provincial Level.   An Inspector of Agriculture is responsible
for all activities of the DGFCA in each of the provinces. The Inspector
and his staff are responsible administratively to the Provincial Governor
and technically to the DGFCA. Under the Inspector are five bureaus managed
by Bureau Heads and responsible for: Extension, Economics, Crop Protection,
Planning, and Crop Production. Subject Matter Specialists (PPS) are assigned
to the five bureaus in accordance with their area of specialization and
operate on a provincial, or in some cases sub-provincial basis. The field
work of the PPS is coordinated by one of the Bureau Heads, usually the
Head of Food Crop Extension. With the bulk of the PPS work being concen-
trated on extension or extension related activities the Extension Bureau
Head would be responsible for coordinating their activities in each of the
project provinces.
37.       District (Kabupaten) Level.   The five DGFCA provincial bureaus
are represented by five corresponding Sections in each district. Under the
project, the Head of the Extension Section would be responsible for imple-
mentation of the extension program in the district, in coordination with the
District BIMAS Committee. They would be assisted by two middle level exten-
sion workers (PPM), one to supervise the Rural Extension Centers (REC's) and
the other to organize and coordinate the training activities of the extension
service. The field level extension program is based on a system of REC's and
Village Units (VU). The number of REC's per district would vary from one to
six depending on the population density in the area. Each REC would be staffed
by two PPM's and from 10 to 20 PPL's depending on the number of Village Units
(VU) and farms served by the REC. Each VU would comprise 2-3 villages,
600-1,000 ha of rice land and about 1,700 farm families. In non-irrigated
areas a VU may be as large as a subdistrict. Each VU has one field extension
worker, who is expected to service 15 to 20 contact farmers and their fol-
lowers. For every 10-15 Village Units (VU) there would be a REC for adminis-
trative and training purposes and Subject Matter Specialists (PPS) to back-
stop and train the field extension workers. In addition to extension work,
the field extension workers would continue to be responsible for adminis-
trative work under the BIMAS program.

38.       The project would provide extension services by well-trained staf,
on a regular systematic basis to a large number of farmers. At present there
are some 3,840 VU's, covering 4.2 milllion ha and serving 8.9 million farm
families in the nine provinces. The number of VU's would be increased to
nearly 6,200, the area to about 6.0 million ha and the number of farm fami-
lies to be served to 12.8 million. With the increase in the number of exten-
sion workers, the average number of farm families served by a PPL would fall
from 3,300 to 1,700.
Staffing
39.       Extension Bureau and Section Heads, who are already in post, general-
ly have a university degree in agriculture with several years experience in
agricultural extension and a good record in organization and personnel manage-
ment. Provincial and sub-Provincial PPS's would be university trained and
have some degree of specialization. Senior PPM's would have either a degree
with at least two years of practical experience and specialized training, or
they would be graduates of a Senior Agricultural High School (SPMA) with six
years experience and specialized training. All PPL's would be graduates of
SPMA's and would receive additional in-service training.
40.       The existing staff complement of extension personnel employed in
the nine project provinces and future staff requirements would be as follows:
Present     Required     Incremental
PPS                           180         300            120
PPM                            -        1,340          1,340
PPL                         3,960       7,600          3,640
At present, the PPM position has not officially been established, although
about 50 supervisory E'PL's function as PPM's and are unofficially known as
such. The Government would however establish the grade of PPM under the
project. The requirements for PPL's would be met by recruitment over a
four-year period from the Senior Agricultural High Schools, which turn out
about 2,100 graduates annually in the project provinces. The demand for
additional PPM's woulcl be met by promotion of the more experienced PPL's
and sub-district and district administrative and regulatory staff. The
additional PPS's required under the project would be recruited from university
graduates over a four-year period. The two major agricultural universities
in the country turn out about 260 graduates per year. The government would
ensure that suitably qualified staff would be appointed to all extension and
supervisory positions under the project and that all staff would receive a
remuneration commensurate with their functions (Section 3.05 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
Extension Methodology
41.       The objectivre of the project would be to provide the farmer, on
a regular, frequent and systematic basis, with up-to-date advice which would



- 12 -
have immediate impact on his yields and income. In each village unit there
would be at least one field extension worker (PPL) who would deal with all
food crops of smallholders in an area of about 1,000 ha. The PPL would be
available to 1,700 farm families within his area, but he would focus his
efforts on about 16 groups of 10-15 progressive farmers, headed by a contact
farmer. Each progressive farmer in turn would transmit the advice received
from the PPL to a group of 7-10 neighboring farmers. Each PPL would be as-
signed 16 farmer groups, visiting each group once a fortnight on a fixed time
and day. PPL's would motivate these farmers to adopt new and improved tech-
niques rapidly so that their farms would serve as models to their neighbors.
42.       Every fortnight PPL's and PPM's would attend a one-day class
designed to give them the practical information to be imparted to the far-
mers in the next two weeks. During the first part of the day there would
be a lecture, followed by field work where participants would go through
all steps of the recommended techniques, and concluding with group discu-
sions. During the next two weeks, the PPL would convey this information
to the farmer groups, and the contact farmer or one of the progressive farmers
in each group would lay out a demonstration plot with the assistance of the
PPL. The plot would remain a subject for discussion or further demonstra-
tion throughout the growing season. All farmers would be invited to be
present during the PPL's visit, and progressive farmers would be expected
to attend and to pass on the substance of the recommendations they receive
to between seven and ten of their neighbors.
43.       Initially, emphasis would be placed on a few critical practices
with economically important crops and on aspects where the probability of
quick results is greatest. This focusing of effort would prevent a thin
spread of extension over many crops and farm enterprises, and it would
improve the chance of holding the continuing interest and enthusiasm of
both the farmers and the extension workers.
Fellowships and Training
44.       A fellowship and training program would be provided under the
project. Six post-graduate fellowships would be awarded. Ten PPS's would
be sent annually, over the five-year project duration, to the Rice Production
and Multiple Cropping courses conducted at the International Rice Research
Institute in the Philippines. Some 150 extension workers and leading
farmers would participate in short visits to other Asian countries to
observe innovative and successful farm practices.
45.       On appointment all staff assigned to the project would undergo
an orientation course. Long-term courses for both PPM's and PPS's would
be held at the Agricultural Training Institute near Bogor or at one of the
13 Agricultural In-Service Training Centers, which are under the control of
the Agency for Education, Training and Extension. Regular fortnightly train-
ing sessions for PPL's would be conducted in village halls or in REC's where
the necessary facilities are available. These courses would be highly
topical and practical. At least two annual workshops or seminars of four



- 13 -
to five days would be held in each district for all extension workers.
During these pre-seasoin workshops, the extension strategy and the extension
targets for the coming season would be outlined and discussed.
Rural Extension Centers
46.       As previous]y mentioned (para. 37) extension services under
the project would be organized and coordinated at the field level through
Rural Extension Centers (REC). About 179 existing REC's in the nine
selected provinces would be rehabilitated and a further 350 new REC's would
be constructed; each center would cover 15,000-25,000 families. Another 60
REC's, of which 33 are located in East Java, 23 in West Java and four in South
Sulawesi, would be financed through an ongoing irrigation project (Loan
1100-IND), from the West Java and East Java Provincial budgets, and through a
USAID bilateral aid program, respectively.
47.       DGFCA would have overall responsibility for construction of the
REC's with a firm of architects providing day-to-day supervision.
Construction and Implementation Schedule
48.       Each new REC would consist of a small building (40 m ) with offices
for the PPM's and storage room for extension equipment, etc. Many of the
rehabilitated centers would have a meeting hall, which are not required
in new centers since all villages have a meeting hall that could be used
for extension meetings. All REC's would be provided with basic furniture
and equipment; extension personnel would be provided with transportation
(bicycles, motorcycles or four-wheel drive vehicles, depending on the dist-
ance of the REC from t:heir area of work). The Government would make the
necessary provisions l:o acquire the land needed to construct the new REC's.
49.       There are numerous qualified local contractors to carry out
the necessary civil works contracts. DGFCA would engage a loca'L firm of
architects to assist with the   preparation of construction and site plans
for REC's, tender documents and annual construction schedules. After con-
tracts are awarded, construction supervision of REC's in the field would
continue to rest with the architects. The appointment of a finn of archi-
tects acceptable to the Bank would be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed Loan (Section 6.01 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
50.       Establishment of the 529 REC's under the project would be phased
over a 5-year period. Required staff would be trained in advance of com-
missioning new or rehabilitated centers. The training program would be
carried out continuously during the project's life.
Rice Research Contract:
51.       The Government engaged in 1972 specialists from the International
Rice Research Institul:e (IRRI) to strengthen rice, maize and soybean research
activities included in the Seed Project financed under Credit 246-IND. The



- 14 -
contract with IRRI was renegotiated in 1975 and extended until 1982. Credit
246-IND originally provided about $1.0 million to meet the cost of IRRI spe-
cialists; the revised contract will cost about $1.7 million. Since Credit
246-IND would be closed on September 30, 1977, by which time it is estimated
that the disbursements for IRRI specialists would amount to roughly the $1.0
million provided in that Credit, the additional $700,000 of IRRI services
would be financed under the proposed loan.
Project Monitoring
52.       Project effectiveness would be gauged from the results of the
monitoring program initiated under Loan 1100-IND. This monitoring program
is based on sampling system developed with the help of an internationally
recruited expert and covers nearly 1.0 million ha of rehabilitated irrigation
areas. Data to be generated by this on-going program would also be used to
monitor progress of the proposed project.
Project Costs
53.       Details of project costs, including incremental operating costs,
are summarized below:
Foreign
Project Component                  Local  Foreign  Total  Exchange
----(US$ Million)----      %
Land Acquisition                    2.2      -      2.2      -
REC's                               2.3     0.9     3.2       28
Vehicles and Equipment              1.4     9.2    10.6      87

- 15 -
Financing
54.       The proposed Bank loan of $22.0 million would finance 50 percent of
total project costs including the full foreign exchange cost and about $6.2
million of the local costs. Local cost financing is justified in view of the
project's low foreign axchange component and the need for Bank participation
at a meaningful level in financing the cost of the project. The government
would provide the remaining $22.2 million and would also ensure the provision
of adequate funds, facilities and other resources to maintain in the Project
Provinces the expanded level of extension services to be provided following
the completion of the project (Section 4.04 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Procurement
55.       Civil works contract for the construction and rehabilitation of
REC's ($3.2 million) would be small, about $6,000 per REC, spread out both
geographically and temporally, and would not be suitable for international
competitive bidding. Contracts would be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding following local advertising, in accordance with usual Government
procurement procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank. Procedures for
prequalification of civil works contractors, which are mandatory under
Indonesian laws, are acceptable.
56.       About $10.6 million worth of vehicles and equipment would be pur-
chased under the project. Vehicles and equipment costing about $8.5 million
would be procured following international competitive bidding procedures in
accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. Equipment subject to international
competitive bidding would be grouped in large enough contracts to attract
competition. A preference of 15 percent of the c.i.f. price of imported goods,
or the actual customs duty, whichever is lower, would be extended to qualified
local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids. Up to 20 vehicles needed for
the start-up period of the project would be procured in accordance with usual
government procurement procedures. Such items as extension equipment, hand-
books, small maintenance tools and furniture, for a total of about $1.0
million, which are not suitable for international competitive bidding, would
be procured on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in
accordance with normal Government procurement procedures, which are acceptable
to the Bank. In addition, off-the-shelf items costing less than $10,000 each,
subject to an aggregate total not exceeding $150,000 would be purchased on the
basis of prudent shopping (minimum of three price quotations, if possible).
Procurement of furniture, equipment and transport items would be phased with
the construction of RE:C's and staff apointments. DGFCA would be responsible
for procurement of goods under the project.
Disbursement
57.       The proposed Loan would be disbursed at the rate of 100 percent
of foreign expenditures for imported equipment, 95 percent against the total
cost of locally manufactured equipment and 65 percent for imported equipment,
procured locally. Disbursements for vehicles assembled in Indonesia and



- 16 -
procured through prudent shopping would be at the rate of 40 percent of total
expenditures. For services of consultants and for all training, both overseas
and local, disbursements would be at 100 percent of total cost against state-
ments of expenditures. Disbursements for civil works would be at 85 percent
of expenditures submitted by DGFCA after certification by the architects. It
is expected that disbursements would be completed by June 30, 1982.
Benefits and Justification
58.       Within the nine Provinces, the project would reach some 12.8
million farm families, cultivating about 7.3 million ha of paddy land and
about 4.0 million ha of annual food crops. All farmers would benefit from
direct or indirect contact with extension workers, who would convey the most
practical and profitable advice for their crop production enterprise. Total
project costs are $3.40 per farm family and incremental annual operating
costs, following project completion, amount to $1.34 per farm family.
59.       Because of the nature of the project it is not possible to quan-
tify the benefits of the project. However, a hypothetical calculation may
be made which is indicative of the high returns that may be generated by the
project. In order to realize a 20 percent economic rate of return, the incre-
mental net value of production, after completion of project construction, in
year seven, would have to amount to $9.5 million per year which would require
an increase in paddy yield of only 8 kg per ha over the 7.3 million ha of
paddy land in the project provinces. Such an increase should be easily
attainable in view of the relatively low existing yield levels and the large
potential increment that is possible using present limited inputs and know-
ledge.
60.       Aside from generating high economic benefits at a low cost per
participating farm family, the project would also have a favorable impact
on income distribution. Poor farmers stand to benefit most from the
project because unlike many of the less poor farmers, they are often ineli-
gible to receive BIMAS loans and thus have limited access to the extension
services.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
61.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and
the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and the text of a draft
resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Execu-
tive Directors separately.
62.       Features of the Loan Agreement of special interest are referred to
in paragraphs 35, 40, 49 and 54 of this report. The appointment of a firm
of architects, acceptable to the Bank, and of the Project Director are spe-
cial conditions of effectiveness of the proposed Loan.



- 17 -
63.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
64.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION I/
Cr. No. 127:      Irrigation Rehabilitation:   US$5 Million Credit of
September 6, 1968; Effective Date: March 25, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
All civil works were completed on March 31, 1976. Additional
drainage work will be carried out under Loan 1100-IND. The closing date has
been postponed by one year to allow for payment of late accounts.
Cr. No. 154:      Highways:   US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Effective Date: October 2, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975.
Rehabilitation work, of acceptable quality, has been
completed. The work accomplished exceeded the project's original target.
The program for improved highway maintenance included in the project has
been completed. A project completion report is being prepared for issuance
before June 30, 1976.
Cr. No. 155:      Agricultural Estates:   US$16 Million Credit of June 20,
1969; Effective Date: December 10, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
With improvements in management and much higher inter-
national prices, particularly for palm oil, prevailing in 1974, the
financial position of the estate groups has improved. The field and
factory standards have now been raised to a good technical level and
the managements have been advised to concentrate on cost control in order
to prepare for the time when produce prices may become less attractive.
The combined efforts of the management, consultants and IDA missions
to review project implementation are yielding good results. The closing
date has been postponed to December 31, 1976 to enable payment to con-
sultants for services for other rubber estates.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 165:      Eleci:ricity Distribution:  US$15 million Credit of
October 29, 1969; Effective Date: June 1, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The closing date was postponed to December 31, 1975, to
allow for payment of small amounts outstanding. The project completion re-
port will be prepared in conjunction with that for Credit No. 334.
Cr. No. 193:       PUSRl Fertilizer:  US$35 Million Credit of June 15,
1970 (as amended May 21, 1973); Effective Date:
January 15, 1971; Closing Date:   December 31, 1976.
The urea plant has successfully passed its performance
test and is operating at close to 90 percent of rated capacity. The gas
gathering and transmission system is also completed and sufficient gas is
being delivered to the plant. The closing date has been postponed to December
31, 1976 to allow for delivery and installation of remaining equipment.
Cr. No. 194:       Second Agricultural Estates:  US$17 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Effective Date: February 9, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
After initial delays, there have been considerable
improvements in management and these, combined with high prices, particular-
ly for palm oil, have resulted in the two estate groups being put in a
much stronger financial position. On the rubber group (PNP IV) more effort
is necessary to improve agricultural standards and tapping methods. With
the rapid expansion of investment of the palm oil group (PNP VI), there is
a need to employ expertise in financial planning, control and management,
which are now the main constraints to efficient development. This estate
group is undertaking action in this respect.    The closing date has been
postponed by one year to allow payment for remaining equipment, civil
works and consultants' contracts.
Cr. No. 195:       Second Irrigation Rehabilitation:   US$18.5 Million Credit
of June 15, 1970; Effective Date:   December 3], 1970;
Closing Date: November 30, 1976.
ProbLems of quality and progress of construction still
exist, but the project entity assisted by the consultants are tackling
these vigorously, and the situation is improving, although not sufficiently
to make up for earlier delays. Costs are likely to be double the overall
appraisal estimate, due to inflation, but the Government will provide any
additional funds required and, because of higher rice prices, the project
will continue to have a satisfactory rate of return. Completion of dis-
bursements will be about two years behind the original schedule.
Cr. No. 210:       Tele_ommunications Expansion:   US$12.8 Million Credit
of July 13, 1970; Effective Date: February 18, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
The project has been completed except for the installation
of the telex exchange at Medan, which is now expected to be in service by



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 14
June 1976. The delay in completion of the Medan telex exchange was due to
late completion of a building to house the exchange. The closing date of
the Credit has been extended up to June 30, 1976, which should be suffi-
cient to allow for payments of outstanding contracts. The audit of finan-
cial statements for FY1973 is expected to be completed in May 1976 and
efforts are being made to ensure timely audit in future.
Cr. No. 211:      Fisheries:   US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970;
Effective Date: January 15, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976.
The project is about two years behind the original schedule due
to delays in engaging consultants and in executing contracts for the shore
facilities. There has been a substantial project cost increase but the
project is still expected to be financially viable due to the greatly
increased skipjack prices. Government has recently appointed new project
management. The first stage of operation of project facilities is expected
to start shortly.
Cr. No. 219:       Education:  US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970;
Effective Date: January 29, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
Project implementation in the Department of Education
is satisfactory. Civil works for the five Technical Training Centers
(TTCs) have been completed. About 90 percent of the equipment has been
purchased and about 60 percent delivered and installed. All TTCs began to
operate at full capacity in January 1976 when the new academic year started.
Over 500 technical teachers have completed or are about to complete their
training. Technical assistance financed by the U.K. for the project is
also satisfactory. Disbursement has improved considerably. Revised
total project cost is now about 40 percent above appraisal estimate. The
Government will finance the cost overrun. The project is expected to be
completed about three months ahead of schedule.
Cr. No. 220:       Third Irrigation Rehabilitation:   US$14.5 Million Credit
of November 6, 1970; Effective Date: May 28, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Construction remains about two to three years behind
schedule. The problems which caused this delay - difficulties in preparation
of contract document, late financial allocations, heavy rains in the 1973 con-
struction season and, more recently, slow response by GOI to high inflation
rates and consequent civil works costs overruns - have been mainly overcome,
but time lost cannot be regained. Estimated project cost is 50 percent above
the appraisal estimate, but with higher rice prices on the world market, the
project's economic rate of return remains over 20 percent. The closing date
has been postponed by 18 months as a result of project delay.

Cr. No. 246:      Seeds:   US$7.5 Million Credit of May 19, 1971;
Effective Date: December 7, 1971; Closing Date:
September 30, 1977.
Significant progress has been made in the const:ruction
of the irrigation infrastructure and in land development at the National
Seeds Corporation (NSC). Construction is proceeding satisfactorily and is
now 70 percent completed. The inadequacy of NSC management at the opera-
tional level is reflected in technical production problems, low yields of
seed and high costs of production. Increasing nation-wide production prob-
lems caused by prevalent disease, pests and insect losses has resulted in
government authorities now giving certified seed production high priority.
Cr. No. 259:      Tea:   US$15 Million Credit of June 24, 1971; Effective
Date: September 17, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Agricultural achievements to date have far exceeded
appraisal expectations necessitating construction and rehabilitation
of three additional factories. Project completion, estimated for December
1977, can probably be advanced by up to one year. Rising costs are creating
pressure on available funds and the main challenge for the two PTPs will
be to reduce working capital requirements, as well as overhead and indirect
costs, and improve labcr productivity.
Cr. No. 260:       Second Highway:  US$34 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Effective Date: August 10, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
Construction work is about 80 percent finished and should
be completed by August 1976, about one and a half years behind schedule.
The delay was caused lergely by slow progress in mobilizing contractors,
difficulties in equipment delivery, heavy rains and landslides. The closing
date has therefore beern postponed by 15 months to December 31, 1976. Design
standards for the road sections have been slightly lowered and some savings
have been achieved, which, together with other savings have partly offset
construction cost increases of 12 percent.
Cr. No. 275:      Thirc! Technical Assistance: US$4.0 Million Credit of
December 29, 1971; Effective Date: February 25,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Progress on this project is satisfactory. The closing
date has been postponed by another year to complete disbursements for
ongoing studies.
Cr. No. 288:       Second Education:  US$6.3 Million Credit of March 9,
1972; Effective Date: June 7, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
This agricultural training project, being implemented
by the Department of Agriculture, is about 16 months delayed because of



ANNEX II
Page 8 of 14
late appointment of consultant architects, lack of counterpart funds, delays
in bid analysis and in awarding contracts. As a result, civil works,
which were to be completed already, have not commenced. Furniture and
equipment procurement have therefore been deferred. Unlike the physical
aspects of the project, the educational aspects are generally on schedule.
Total project costs are now estimated to be 90 percent higher than the
original estimate. Government has budgeted for the cost overrun. Disburse-
ment, which has been slow, should improve since civil works contracts have
now been awarded.
Cr. No. 289:      Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation:    US$12.5 Million Credit
of March 9, 1972; Effective Date: May 5, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977.
Civil Works and equipment purchases for the main project,
Pekalen-Sampean, are proceeding but completion of civil works will be
about two years behind schedule. Due to inflation, project costs are
likely to be substantially higher than appraisal estimates. Consultants
for the various studies are at work with their counterparts. Disbursements
are also on schedule.
Cr. No. 300:       Population:  US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20, 1972;
Effective Date: November 2, 1972; Closing Date: June 30,
1978.
Progress of this project is generally satisfactory.
Steps are being taken to improve preparation and implementation of project
components concerned with communications, research and evaluation. All
vehicles have been procured and good progress is being made with equipment
procurement. The civil works section of the Project Implementation Unit
functions well but is underutilized because of delays in making policy
decisions. Construction costs will exceed appraisal estimates by 135
percent. Population Education is now being introduced into school curricula
after a successful trial. Despite its limitations, the national family
planning program, of which the project is an integral part, is expanding
annually and showing good results.
Cr. No. 310:       Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO I):   US$10 Million Credit
of June 7, 1972; Effective Date: August 10, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
This credit is fully committed.
Cr. No. 318:       Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation:   US$8.5 Million
Credit of June 28, 1972; Effective Date: October 19,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
Progress on this project is slow but funds are expected to
be fully committed by September 30, 1977. Due to substantial cost increases,
only about half of the anticipated tonnage will be rehabilitated.

Cr. No. 319:       Fourth Agricultural Estates:  US$11 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Effective date: January 30, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The physical progress of the project is ahead of the
appraisal schedule. The financial position of the estate group is dif-
ficult due to an unsatisfactory debt/equity ratio. Measures to improve
the situation are under review.
Cr. No. 334:       Second Electricity Distribution:   US$40 Million Credit
of September 29, 1972; Effective Date: March 12, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The Jakarta distribution program financed from Credits
165-IND and 334-IND (together $55 million) encountered implementation delays
due to procurement problems and cumbersome management procedures. As a result
the project is two years behind the original schedule. These difficulties
have been resolved and recent progress is encouraging. No further delays
are therefore expected.
Cr. No 355:        Beef Cattle Development:  US$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31, 1973; Effective Date: May 30, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980.
Several problems have seriously delayed project imple-
mentation. Government s budget allocation has been insufficient, and fi-
nancial management and coordination have been weak. The last supervision
mission undertook a thorough project review and its recommendations, which
include major changes in project scope and objectives, are presently under
discussion with Govermaent.
Cr. No. 358:      North Sumatera Smallholder Development:    US$5 Million
CredLt of February 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 13,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
Project performance, which had suffered from severe fin-
nancial and organizational difficulties, has improved greatly. Physical
progress is encouraging; rubber planting and rice intercropping are now
on schedule. There is some room for improvement in financial management,
in which consultants are assisting.   Total project costs are now estimated
at about three times the original estimate of US$10 million. Disbursements
are expected to be completed ahead of schedule.
Cr. No. 387:       Third Education:  US$13.5 Million Credit of June 1,
1973; Effective Date: August 29, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project is about 10 months behind schedule, mainly due
to insufficient top management staff and paper shortages last year. The paper



ANNEX II
Page 10 of 14
shortage has been overcome and about 18 million text books were printed by
January 1976, about four months behind schedule. Steps are being taken to
strengthen project management and to improve arrangements for expert services.
Measures to improve project implementation have been discussed and agreed with
the Government. The book testing and teacher training programs are on schedule,
but their results have not yet been evaluated. Procurement of instructional
equipment will be completed by early 1976.
Cr. No. 388:      Third Highways:   US$14 Million Credit of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date: June 25, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977.
Construction work on the two North Sulawesi road sections
in the project was started early in 1974 under two contracts and is now 60
percent completed. Construction has been delayed mainly because of long
mobilization periods and heavy rains. Project costs will likely exceed
original estimates (including contingencies) by 57 percent mainly due to
sharply escalated prices. The training program has been completed success-
fully.
Cr. No. 399:      West Java Thermal Power:   US$46 Million Credit of
June 22, 1973; Effective Date: August 28, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Bids received for the first two 100 mw units at Muara
Karang were about 65 percent higher than estimated at the time of appraisal.
This, together with construction cost increases, has resulted in an increase
in the total project cost of more than 100 percent. Government will provide
the additional funds required. PLN has satisfactorily met the initial targets
in its financial recovery plan provided for under the terms of the Credit
Agreement.
Cr. No. 400:       Smallholder and Private Estate Tea:   US$7.8 Million
Credit of June 22, 1973; Effective Date: November 30,
1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
Planting is presently slightly behind schedule but
it is expected that targets will be achieved or even exceeded by the end
of the 1975/76 planting season. Project nurseries are well organized
and field work is proceeding well. Also non-participating farmers have
benefitted from the project. Total project costs are estimated to be
double the amount originally envisaged and project management is attempting
to achieve cost reductions. Due to the high prices for tea (about twice
the level expected at the time of appraisal), the economic rate of return
is still satisfactory.

Cr. No. 405:       Sugar Industry Rehabilitation:  US$50 Million Credit of
June 26, 1973; Effective Date: April 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
In view of the rapid and continuing increase in the cost
of sugar factory machinery and the more recent shortage of budgetary funds,
the scope of the above.-mentioned project has been reduced by the deletion of
six minor rehabilitations from the project description. The revised project
consists of the major rehabilitation of two factories and the construction
of a new factory. Credit funds have been reallocated from the minor to
the major rehabilitation and to the new construction.
Cr. No. 428:       Pulo Gadung Industrial Estate:   US$16.5 Million Credit
of September 14, 1973; Effective Date: November 13,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Of 430 ha earmarked for the project, about 270 ha had been
acquired by end 1975, and 108 ha had been developed to readiness for
occupation. 42 factories are operating on the estate and 35 more are in
various stages of construction or commissioning. The rate of new applica-
tions for land allotment has been slower in recent months than in the past,
and the estate is intensifying its promotional efforts. Overall, operations
are profitable, despite an increase in construction costs.
Cr. No. 436:       Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia
(PDFCI): US$10 Million Credit of November 2, 1973;
Effective Date: March 6, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
After a long start-up period and difficulties in finding
and recruiting qualified local staff, PDFCI has now reached the operating
stage. Commitments have started and are expected to increase rapidly
as PDFCI's own operational capability improves.
Cr. No. 451:       Fourth Technical Assistance:  US$5 Million Credit of
January 2, 1974; Effective Date: February 15, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Progress under the project is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 479:       Bali. Tourism:  US$16.0 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
EffEctive Date: December 4, 1974; Closing Date:
AuguLst 31, 1979.
Project implementation has improved after initial diffi-
culties. Tender documents for all major infrastructure works were issued
in January 1976. The earliest possible completion date has shifted from
February 1979 to October 1979. Budgetary allocations as requested by the
Bali Tourism Development Corporation for FY76/77 are satisfactory. Negotia-
tions with one group of investors are in progress but otherwise investor in-
terest appears to be low. Promotional efforts to attract additional investors
have been intensified in 1976.

Cr. No. 480:      Fisheries Credit:   US$6.5 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: January 8, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Lending for fishponds is now on schedule, and the contract for
construction of shore facilities at Ambon has been awarded. There may how-
ever be some delays in skipjack vessel construction due to procurement pro-
blems. Although significant cost increases are envisaged, the project is
still expected to be financially viable because of increases in fish prices.
Cr. No. 514:         Jatiluhur Irrigation Extension:   US$30 Million Credit
of October 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 10, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
The consultants are now making good progress in designing
works and preparing contract documents. The first civil works contract is
expected to be let in August 1976, about one year behind the original schedule,
due in part to delays in loan signing.
Loan No. 1005:       Railway:  US$48.0 Million Loan of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: August 16, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Procurement of material and equipment, which had been
slow due to poor organization and inadequate budget allocation, has now
improved. Bids have been received for most items and the bulk of the con-
tracts should be signed soon. Passenger traffic in 1975 was slightly lower
than in 1974, but still higher than forecast; freight traffic has continued
to decline due mainly to poor maintenance and inadequate motive power, which
should improve towards the end of 1976. Although tariffs were raised in May
1975, increasing passenger revenues by about 25 percent and freight revenues
by about 10 percent, the operating ratio is likely to deteriorate further, as
operating costs have continued to rise at a faster rate.
Loan No. 1040:       Jakarta Urban Development:   US$25 Million Loan of
September 27, 1974; Effective Date: January 15, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Progress on the Kampung Improvement Program has been
very good; costs were less than estimated, allowing additional work to be
undertaken. Execution of the Klender Sites and Services Scheme is one year
behind schedule due to disagreements about site boundaries. Most consultant
contracts commenced early in 1976.
Loan No. 1049:       Five Cities Water Supply:   US$14.5 Million Loan of
October 31, 1974; Effective Date: May 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Due to administrative and managerial problems the
project is running 8-10 months behind schedule. This delay together

with higher rates of inflation than anticipated is expected to increase
project costs 20-25 percent above the appraisal estimate. Water Enterprises
have now been established in each of the five cities and good progress has
been made in their staffing. The anticipated interdepartmental decree which
would govern the relationship of the Water Enterprises to the Central Govern-
ment's Directorate of Sanitary Engineering has not been issued; it is now
proposed to clarify this relationship in a Presidential Decree which is
being drafted.
Loan No. 1054:     Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO II):   US$50 Million
Loan of November 20, 1974; Effective Date: January 14,
1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Commitments and disbursements initially were slower
than expected, but they should increase in the second half of FY76. The
progress of this project is satisfactory.
Loan No. 1089:     Second Fertilizer Expansion:   US$115 Million Loan of
February 28, 1975; Effective Date: April 29, 1975;
Closing Date: August 31, 1978.
Work on the PUSRI III project is proceeding according to
schedule. Work on the related gas pipeline is experiencing delay, but steps
are being taken to expedite implementation.
Loan No. 1100:     Sixth Irrigation:  US$65 Million Loan of April 10,
1975; Effective Date: June 20, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982.
Consultants for the project and technical assistance advisors
have been selected. Construction work is about five months behind schedule
due to the delay in selection of consultants.
Loan No. 1127:     Fourth Power:  US$41 Million Loan of June 17, 1975;
Effective Date: October 23, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980.
The options for a third 100 MW unit at Muara Karang, which
were included in the tenders for the first two units financed under Credit
399, have been exercised. The project is on schedule and expected to be
completed during 1978.
Loan No. 1139:     Fertilizer Distribution:   US$68 Million Loan of
July 10, 1975; Effective Date: Auigust 28, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.

Procurement                : Contracts for civil works for the construction
and rehabilitation of REC complexes, totalling
$3.2 million, which are small and geographically
spread, would be awarded on the basis of compet-
itive bidding, following local advertising in
accordance with usual Government procurement
procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank.
Contracts for vehicles, except for 20 vehicles
required for the start-up period of the project,
and equipment amounting to about $8.5 million,
would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines. In bid comparison, domestic manu-
facturers would be allowed a preferential margin
of 15 percent or the existing customs duty, which-
ever is lower, over c.i.f. price of competing
imports. The 20 start-up period vehicles would
be procured in accordance with the usual govern-
ment procurement procedures. Small equipment
items such as extension equipment, handbooks,
tools and furniture totalling about $1.0 million,
would be procured following usual Government
procurement procedures, which are satisfactory to
the Bank. In addition off-the-shelf items
costing less than $10,000 each, subject to an
aggregate total of $150,000 would be purchased on
the basis of prudent shopping (minimum of three
price quotations, if possible).
Technical Assistance          The technical assistance would include:    (a)
An extension specialist to assist the DGFC for
about 50 man/months (at $6,000 per month) with
all aspects of planning and implementing the
food crops extension services in the nine pro-
ject. Provinces; (b) 50 man-months of short-term
consultant services to assist DGFCA with the staff
training program; (c) a firm of architects to
assist with the preparation of construction and
site plans for the REC's tender documents, annual
construction schedules and construction supervi-
sion; and (d) extension of IRRI rice research
contract up to 1982.



ANNEX III

In addition, fellowships would be provided for
outstanding extension personnel of DGFCA. The
fellowships would be made available for post-
graduate studies and for the Rice Production
or Multiple Cropping Courses at IRRI in the
Philippines. Study trips would be awarded to
extension personnel and prominent innovative
farmers, who would study and observe advanced
extension methods and farming techniques in
rural areas of neighboring Asian countries.
Rate of Return                Although because of the nature of the project
it would not be possible to quantify the bene-
fits of the project, hypothetical calculations
indicate that the project achieves a very high
economic rate of return because an increase of
only 8 kg of paddy per ha would be enough to
accomplish a rate of return of 20 percent.
