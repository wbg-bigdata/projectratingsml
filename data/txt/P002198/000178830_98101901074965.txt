PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
RWANDA - BANQUE RWANDAISE DE DEVELOPPEMENT (BRD)
(CREDIT 655-RW)
PREFACE
This is a completion report on the First IDA credit (Cr. 655-Rw)
to the Banque Rwandaise de Developpement (BRD). The credit of US$4.0
million was approved in July 1976, signed in August 1976 and became
effective in March 1977. At the request of BRD US$0.1 was cancelled on
January 7, 1982 and the credit was closed at that date.
The Eastern Africa Regional Office has prepared this report on
the basis of information gathered during a mission to Rwanda in November
1982. The report reviews BRD's institutional developments since 1975 and
its utilization of the proceeds of the credit. No comments were received
from the Borrower.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
RWANDA - BANQUE RWANDAISE DE DEVELOPPEMENT (BRD)
(CREDIT 655-RW)
HIGHLIGHTS
Credit 655-Rw was the first IDA operation with the Banque
Rwandaise de Dgveloppement (BRD) and represented a diversification of IDA's
assistance to Rwanda which, until then, was concentrated on improving the
road network and strengthening agriculture production. Since appraisal in
1975, IDA has enjoyed a close relationship with BRD's management and its
senior staff who appreciated IDA missions's comments and guidance. Today,
after 3 credits, BRD remains IDA's only channel for assisting the small but
fast growing industrial sector in Rwanda.
BRD's success in establishing itself as a strong finance company
and the main support for the development of the private sector in Rwanda
was due to three factors:
(i)  a stable political environment and a good investment climate
which prevailed all along the period 1975-82 when the economy grew
at a fast rate while a strong foreign exchange reserve position
was maintained by the central bank;
(ii)  a competent and dynamic management at BRD who was fast to seize
good investment opportunities but pursued very prudent financial
policies; and
(iii)  excellent support and advice from a small but dedicated team of
expatriate experts with a good knowledge of the country and the
institution.
In the future, BRD's operations are expected to continue
increasing at a high rate, but with the Rwandese economy facing a more
difficult situation, BRD should, more than in the past, focus attention on
the impact of its operations on the country's foreign exchange reserves and
employment situation. In this respect, it should somewhat move away from
secured lending and emphasis on collateral to lending based on project
appraisal.
The flexible position taken by IDA on many occasions over the
last 7 years, including the exemption from payment of the commitment fee
granted to BRD under the first two projects and the decision not to impose
a limitation on the use of IDA funds despite BRD's tendency to finance
large projects with IDA lines of credit (paras. 1.05, 3.04 and 5.05), has
substantially contributed to the fast growth and present sound financial
position of the institution. This understanding attitude has also
tightened IDA's relationship with BRD and helped maintain a meaningful
dialogue with BRD's management on important policy issues. One result has,
however, been that IDA funds only financed a few large projects
(paras. 5.01 - 5.04).



- iv -
The lesson to be learned from this experience is that, while IDA should
continue to be flexible in justifiable circumstances, we should also
maintain a close scrutiny over BRD's operations, particularly when
reviewing subprojects to ensure that IDA funds are used to the maximum
benefit for the country.
The following points may be of particular interest:
- IDA's efforts to simplify BRD's interest rate structure
(paras. 2.07-2.09).
- BRD and SSE financing (para. 2.10).
- Technical assistance to enterprises (para. 3.04).
- Single project over-exposure (para. 3.05).
- BRD's appraisal process (para. 3.06).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
RWANDA - BANQUE RWANDAISE DE DEVELOPPEMENT (BRD)
(CREDIT 655-RW)
I. INTRODUCTION
Background and Project History
1.01      The Banque Rwandaise de Dgveloppement (BRD) was established in
1967 to provide financing for the creation or development of Rwandese
enterprises through equity investments and/or granting of term loans. At
least 55% of its share capital are reserved for the Government and public
Rwandese agencies, the remainder is open to subscription by private
Rwandese and foreign institutions. There are, however, no differences
between the rights and privileges of either category of shareholders. BRD
started operations in 1968 and since then, has been able to attract a large
number of new shareholders and foreign creditors. It now holds lines of
credit from three different aid donors and its capital, besides the public
sector, is subscribed by four foreign institutions and more than ten
private banks and enterprises in Rwanda.
1.02      IDA relationship with BRD started in 1975 when, at the request of
the Government, a mission visited Rwanda to examine with BRD's management
the situation and prospects of the company and to consider the possibility
of IDA assistance. The mission concluded that in view of BRD's important
role in the financing of development in Rwanda, IDA assistance was
warranted. In July 1976, IDA approved the first credit to BRD. A second
credit was granted in April 1979 and a third in April 1983. Since 1975,
IDA has sent full supervision or appraisal missions to BRD at a rate of
one mission a year.
Credit 655-RW
1.03      The main objectives of the first IDA credit, as stated in the
Appraisal Report were to:
(i) strengthen the project appraisal capabilities, internal
organization and accounting procedures of BRD;
(ii) provide term financing to well conceived investment projects; and
(iii) provide technical assistance to enterprises through BRD.
In assisting BRD, IDA also hoped to improve the Government's own project
evaluation procedures and promote the development of private enterprises.
The following conditions were attached to this first credit:
(a)    BRD should not charge interest rates below 7% per annum on
subloans to small enterprises and 9% per annum on all other
sub-loans;
(b)    BRD should calculate the EROR for all import substitution projects
above the free limit of US$100,000;
(c)    BRD should change its Policy Statement in order not to bear any
foreign exchange risk on its borrowing which would be assumed by
the Government at no cost to BRD.



- 2 -
(d)    BRD's accounts should be audited by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA. The cost of the first three audits would be
financed by the Credit; and
(e)    BRD would provide technical assistance to local enterprises, the
cost of which would be financed by a one-point extra spread given
to BRD under this credit (BRD needs a spread of 4% on its borrowed
funds to cover expenses and makes a normal profit, but was granted
a 5% spread on its IDA borrowing).
Appraised in May 1975, the credit was approved in July 1976 and became
effective in March 1977. It was fully committed on time and disbursed at a
relatively fast pace. The credit was closed on January 7, 1982.
Credit 896-Rw
1.04      The second credit was essentially the continuation of the
institution building efforts undertaken under the first credit. It
also had an additional objective of assisting the Government in undertaking
a study to assess the need for an audit firm and to design a program for
its establishment. Special conditions on this credit were that:
(a)  BRD would raise its interest rates to 8.5% on medium term
sub-loans to small enterprises and to 9% on medium term sub-loans
to all other enterprises, and to 10% on long term sub-loans to
small enterprises and to 11% on long term sub-loans to all other
enterprises; and
(b)  BRD would obtain on a regular basis adequate guarantees of loan
repayment on at least that part of the loan that exceeds its
normal exposure limit of 20% of net worth, either from Government
for public sector projects, or from other creditworthy sources for
private sector projects.
1.05      As under the first credit, BRD was exempted from paying the
commitment fee and received IDA funds from Government at a rate (6%) below
the full IBRD rate (at that time 7%). Finally, the Government continued to
assume the foreign exchange risk at no cost to BRD or the subborrowers.
The credit was appraised in February 1978, approved in July 1979 and became
effective in January 1980. At the end of May 1983, US$4.1 million (78%)
was committed and US$1.1 million (21%) disbursed.
II. MACROECONOMIC, INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES
Macroeconomic objectives
2.01      Economic Structure and Recent Developments.  Rwanda, a small
landlocked country, which depends on Kenya and Tanzania for its access to
the sea, has a population estimated at 5.5 million, most of whom deriving
their livelihood from agriculture. Despite the predominantly rural
characteristics of its economy, Rwanda has a relatively active modern
sector. Services have grown fast over the last 6-7 years and now account



- 3 -
for 37% of GDP. This was mainly due to the rapid growth of foreign aid,
which directly resulted in higher public consumption and investment. These
expenditures, in turn stimulated the growth of commerce and other service
activities. The industrial sector is still small but is growing at a fast
rate. Production is typically of the first generation of import
substitution: brewing, food processing, textiles, plastic utensils etc.
Exports are limited to processed coffee and tea. Agroindustrial
enterprises dominate the sector, accounting for about two-thirds of its
value added. Manufacturing activity is mainly centered around Kigali, the
capital, although some towns in the interior are becoming more active and
important. Ownership is mostly local private with foreign control limited
to a few large enterprises. With the exception of food processing, most
industrial enterprises are highly dependent on imported inputs and,
although there have been so far no strict import controls, transport
difficulties have often resulted in interruption of supplies, forcing firms
to hold large stocks of imports and spare parts, thus increasing their
costs.
2.02      Rwanda's financial system consists of the following institutions:
the central bank, two commercial banks, the Savings Association, a
mortgage bank (Caisse Hypothgcaire), a network of cooperative banks similar
to credit unions (Banques Populaires) and BRD, the development bank. The
two commercial banks are mostly engaged in short term financing of exports,
particularly coffee, and imports. Term lending is provided by the other
financial institutions, with the Savings Association making loans only to
its members and the Banques Populaires concentrating in rural areas. The
Caisse Hypothecaire, which is supposed to finance all housing and building
of a value of RwF 0.5 million or more, is still relatively inactive. BRD
is entrusted with financing development projects although the other
financial institutions, particularly the commercial banks, can also provide
term credit for productive investments with central bank's approval.
2.03      During the period 1975-80, the Rwandese economy experienced a
rapid growth of over 5% per year, as a result of a combination of favorable
external factors (weather, terms of trade and capital inflows) and a
prudent economic and financial management. Per capita income increased
from US$76 in 1974 to US$200 in 1980, but is still among the lowest in the
world. In 1981 and 1982, GDP continued to grow at a high rate, but, in
contrast to previous years, this growth was accompanied by a weakening of
the budget and the balance of payments, reflecting unfavorable world market
conditions for coffee (Rwanda's main export) and some relaxation of the
Government traditional policy of expenditure restraint. At the end of
1982, however, Rwanda still enjoyed a strong reserve position (US$128
million, representing 5.6 months of 1982 imports).
2.04      Rwanda's Third Development Plan (1982-86) retained most of the
objectives of the Second Plan. With regard to industry, these include: (i)
increasing the production of basic goods either for consumption by the
population, or for use in agriculture; (ii) promotion of small scale
enterprises; and (iii) increasing the processing of agricultural and
mineral products to provide the maximum possible employment to compensate
for the limited oppportunities in the rural sector. To achieve these
objectives, the Government uses a number of instruments, the most important
of which are import licensing, price control, industrial licences and



- 4 -
import tariffs. Efforts are being made to streamline the procedures of the
investment code and improve its applicability. Because Rwanda's landlocked
location and the high transport costs provide significant advantages to
local industry, the Government does not have to resort to a deliberate
protection policy. Rwanda maintains a relatively liberal exchange and
trade system. Quantitative restrictions are not normally used. Existing
enterprises enjoy on average a moderate level of tariff protection in
nominal terms but relatively high effective protection as few of them pay
duty on imported inputs. Protection to industry has, however, been raised
significantly by the recent introduction of an import deposit scheme. 1/
IDA recently sent a mission to review the manufacturing sector in Rwanda.
The report, which is being prepared, will serve as a basis for discussion
with the Government on policy and other issues affecting the sector.
2.05      IDA has generally supported Rwanda's development objectives and
strategies, particularly the Government's efforts to increase employment
and to diversify the economy. This has been the major reason for IDA
assistance to BRD which was established to help achieve these objectives.
2.06      BRD's Role.  Working within the Government's framework of
economic policies, BRD has succeeded in establishing itself as the major
source of term lending in Rwanda and has substantially contributed to the
development of the economy. Since its creation in 1967, BRD has provided
financing totalling RwF 3.5 billion (US$37.5 million) for 259 projects with
an estimated total investment cost of about RwF 8.5 million (US$90.2
million). More than 75% of its interventions went to privately owned
enterprises. BRD has thus become the Government's main instrument to
promote the development of the private sector in Rwanda.
Main Issues
2.07      Interest Rates.  Because of different views regarding the role of
interest rates in the development process, this issue has been the most
discussed topic between IDA and BRD over the last 7 years. In Rwanda where
the level of private investment is low, the Government feels that promotors
should not be discouraged by high interest rates. Thus, in setting rates
charged to clients, 2/ BRD should not only take into account its financial
situation and the expected inflation rate, but also the Government's policy
of facilitating private investment in a difficult environment where project
opportunities are limited.
1/  Effective March 1, 1983, imports of certain goods - those with an
import duty of 80% or more, as well as those manufactured locally -
require a 100% advance deposit, which cannot be financed through bank
credit.
2/ BRD's interest rates are not subject to central bank's regulation but
must be approved by its Board in which the Government has a majority
vote.



-5-
2.08      During the period 1975-79, rates set for short-term loans by
commercial banks ranged from 4% for tea export to 11% for import credits
and working capital. The Savings Association, the other institution
mainly engaged in term lending, was allowed a maximum rate of 9% on its
medium-term credits to the private sector. Over that period, BRD charged
rates ranging from 6.5% to 9.0% (including commissions), depending on the
maturity of the loan and the sector. In November 1979, the central bank
put into effect an upward revision of the interest rate structure in Rwanda
and introduced specific guidelines regarding rates charged by commercial
banks for productive investments which, if approved by the central bank,
should not exceed 11%. Other term loans (mostly housing) carry rates of
about 12% for medium-term loans and 13% for long-term ones. Following that
readjustment, BRD raised the overall level of its interest rates to 8-13%
(excluding commissions which included a flat fee of 0.75% of the loan
amount to be paid at signature and a commitment fee of 1%) but introduced
another differentiation, this time, by project profitability.  In relation
to inflation in Rwanda, BRD's interest rates were significantly negative in
real terms in 1978 and 1979 when local prices increased at about 14% per
year as a result of frequent disruptions of supply routes through
neighboring countries and increased import prices. After the 1979
adjustment and as inflation abated, BRD's interest rates became again
positive in real terms, except for those charged to small enterprises and
agricultural projects.
2.09      IDA's efforts in this area have been to (i) simplify BRD's
interest rate structure which is characterized by differentiation by
sector, term and project profitability as measured by the financial rate of
return estimated at appraisal and (ii) bring all rates to a positive level
in real terms so as to improve resource allocation and maintain BRD's
profitability. Under the first credit, after long and strenuous
discussions, it was agreed with BRD that IDA funds be passed on to clients
at a minimum rate of 9% for medium and large enterprises and 7% for SSEs
with the foreign exchange risk borne by the Government. These rates were
further raised under the second credit to 8.5%-10% for SSEs and 9-11% for
other enterprises. At negotiations of the Third Credit, BRD accepted to
(i) eliminate the financial rate of return as a criterion for determining
interest rates; (ii) not to give any interest rate preferential to SSEs,
with the exception of very small loans of less than US$11,000 for which no
detailed evaluation is made; (iii) to set and maintain all interest rates
at positive levels in real terms and to review the level and structure of
interest rates with IDA at least once a year and (iv) to carry out a study
on interest rate structure in Rwanda to see how the system can further be
rationalized and better contribute to the achievement of the Government's
development objectives. As a concession, we agreed to allow BRD to
maintain a small differentiation by sector. IDA's dialogue with BRD and
the Government on this issue has thus been quite fruitful. All BRD's
interest rates are now positive in real terms as can be seen in the table
below:



- 6 -
BRD's Present Interest Rate Structure
(in percent per year)
Medium-term loans   Long-term loans
Agriculture and Livestock                  10                  11
Industry and Mining                        11                 12
Services                                   12                 13
Note:  In addition to the interest rate, a flat rate of 0.75% of the loan
amount is paid at signature and a commitment fee of 1% is charged on
undisbursed funds, effectively increasing the rates charged to clients to
about 10.5% and 11.5% for agriculture, 11.5% and 12.5% for industry and
mining, and 12.5% and 13.5% for services. These rates compare with
inflation projected at 9.5-10.0% over the period 1983-87.
2.10      SSE Financing.  Perhaps the most difficult challenge facing
Rwanda is to provide sufficient job opportunities for the country's
expanding labor force. Unemployment and underemployment are acute in urban
areas, particularly in Kigali (the capital), where the population has been
growing at a fast rate of 9% per year over the last ten years. Although
the Third Development Plan (1982-86) accords a high priority to the
promotion of small enterprises, a labor intensive sector, no coherent
program has been developed to assist them. Until recently BRD had not
placed strong emphasis on financing SSEs because of the risks and costs
attached to this type of lending. In the first two credits, IDA did not
press BRD into this activity as the first priority was to build up and
strengthen the institution. Now that BRD is financially strong and has a
relatively experienced staff, it has decided to launch a new intensive
effort to promote and finance SSEs. Under the third IDA credit, we will
assist BRD in reorienting its operations towards SSEs and have allocated at
least US$2.5 million for that purpose. This third credit also includes a
technical assistance component to help the Government carry out a study of
the issues related to the development of an SSE program in Rwanda which
could lead to a future SSE project.
III. INSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIVES
3.01      BRD's management is highly motivated, competent and stable.
Since IDA's first appraisal in 1975, there was only one change at the top
in 1982 when the last Managing Director was replaced at the end of his
third three-year term by the Advisor to the President of the Republic.  The
new Managing Director is assisted by two competent expatriate experts who
have been with BRD since the mid-1970's. BRD's staff now number 68 (of
whom 23 professionals), i.e., a threefold increase since 1975. Largely due



- 7 -
to a good compensation policy, 3/ BRD has been able to retain staff of
good quality. Some have been with BRD for more than five years. Most of
the professional staff have university degree and are generally dedicated.
Staff development relies mainly upon practical on-the-job training which is
performed by the two expatriate experts who have the confidence of the
staff.
3.02      Since 1975, BRD has substantially improved the quality of its
appraisal work and has developed good operating policies and procedures.
Appraisal reports prepared by the staff are first thoroughly reviewed and
discussed in the Investment Department, then presented to the Studies
Committee, which is chaired by the Director General and composed of all the
Bank's senior staff, before being submitted to the Board.  BRD's staff is
particularly strong in financial analysis. In reviewing subprojects, IDA
seldom questioned BRD's financial evaluation. In contrast, economic
analysis of subprojects is still weak. BRD has been advised to pay more
attention to the economic merits of its operations and has been requested
to calculate the economic rate of return for all non-service sector
projects above US$200,000. Over the last 7 years, BRD has significantly
strengthened its supervision capability. The emphasis put by IDA on
assistance to enterprises and the provision under the first credit of an
extra one point spread to help BRD finance a technical assistance program
played a part in this improvement (para. 3.05).
3.03      Since 1976, in compliance with the provisions of the first Credit
Agreement, BRD accounts have been audited by an independent auditing firm.
The audits are generally satisfactory and in line with IDA requirements.
BRD has sound accounting and financial management systems and uses
appropriate disbursement procedures.
3.04      Under the first credit, funds were allocated to cover the cost of
the first three audits. Although BRD did not use these funds and financed
the audits out of its operating profit, this measure, together with the
exemption for BRD from paying the commitment fee to the Government under
the first two credits (para. 1.05) are indicative of the flexible position
IDA is prepared to take in justifiable circumstances.
Main Issues
3.05      Technical Assistance to Enterprises.  Under the first credit, BRD
was granted an extra point in the spread to help it provide technical
assistance to enterprises. It was expected that BRD would liaise with the
Bureau of Industrial Promotion (Bureau de Promotion Industrielle, to be
established by UNIDO within the Ministry of Economy and Finance) to select
quarterly a number of small- and medium-size firms and establish with their
management an assistance program to be implemented over an agreed period.
BRD recognized that it has not provided assistance to enterprises as it
should have done, but pointed out that (i) the Bureau of Industrial
3/ BRD must comply with Government salary directives but always grants
staff a bonus at the end of the year.  The importance of the bonus
depends on staff performance and BRD's financial results and is
decided by the Director General.  Some senior staff also have housing
privileges.



-8-
Promotion, which was supposed to be established in 1977, only became
effective in 1982; and (ii) alone, BRD could not do much until it was
better established. At that time, BRD was still a young and inexperienced
development institution whose own procedures and capabilities needed
strengthening. The funds made available under the first IDA credit for
assistance to enterprises actually enabled BRD to recruit staff and
improve the supervision of its own projects which is at present adequate.
BRD's staff now visits each project under supervision twice a year. Those
under construction are systematically visited after the first disbursement
and at completion. Projects encountering difficulties receive additional
visits. During supervision missions, BRD's staff often assists small
entrepreneurs in estimating their working capital needs and suggests ways
to improve the quality of their products. Without IDA financing it was
unlikely that BRD could have developed that needed supervision capacity.
Thus, IDA's objective of providing assistance to Rwandese enterprises was
not achieved but BRD made good use of the funds granted to it to reinforce
its procedures and evolve into a strong financial intermediary. Now that
BRD is embarking on SSE financing, and intends to assume a more active role
in the sector, assistance and training of entrepreneurs will by necessity
be an integral and important part of its activity. To carry out this task,
BRD intends to reinforce the Supervision and Assistance Division by
recruiting two more professionals in the next three years.
3.06      Single Project over-Exposure.  As the major term lender in
Rwanda, BRD has financed projects exceeding the normal exposure limit of
20% of net worth. This was recognized as an issue at the time of appraisal
of the second IDA credit and was discussed with BRD's management. Several
alternatives were explored in the Appraisal Report of BRD II (No. 2142-Rw),
but were not pursued because they were either premature or posed problems
to BRD. Co-financing with other local financial institutions in Rwanda was
not feasible as they were not ready to participate in term lending, except
for real estate. The managed fund approach would have reduced BRD's
autonomy and independence in deciding upon the projects which, however, it
would have to administer. Thus, BRD might be faced with the problem of
having to supervise difficult projects which could cost it much more in
staff time and other administrative charges than the management fees
normally granted for this kind of work. At a time when BRD's financial
situation was still fragile, it would have been imprudent to push BRD into
that direction. It was therefore decided to include in the IDA Credit
Agreement a covenant requiring BRD to obtain adequate guarantees on the
part of the loan that exceeded its normal exposure limit. BRD has always
been in compliance with this covenant. In late 1980, BRD obtained from its
Board a new increase in its authorized capital from RwF 416 million to RwF
1 billion. Most of it has been paid-in, which together with reserves and
retained earnings, have increased BRD's exposure limit to nearly RwF 220
million (US$2.3 million), as compared to about RwF 90 million
(US$1.0 million) at the time of BRD II. In view of this increase and
considering BRD's greater emphasis on smaller projects, at negotiations of
the third IDA credit, the over-exposure guarantee condition was eliminated
and BRD was requested to stay within its exposure limit. A covenant to
that effect was included in the Credit Agreement.



-9-
3.07      BRD's Appraisal Process.  As discussed in para. 3.02, the quality
of BRD's appraisal work is good. Projects are thoroughly analyzed and, in
some cases, redesigned during appraisal to make them more suitable to the
Rwandese economic and financial conditions. However, BRD has been somewhat
slow in processing projects which could take more than a year from the time
of submission by the promotor to Board presentation. This was the case for
10 out of a sample of 21 SSE projects financed between 1976 and 1980. The
average processing time for medium and large size projects is about 8
months, with some exceeding a year. Considering that most BRD's projects
are refinanced under external lines of credit and must be approved by
foreign institutions, funds are sometimes made available to the promotors
only 1 year to 1-1/2 year after submission of their project to BRD.  Over
the period 1979-82, with 7 project officers, BRD had approved on average
only 13 projects per year, of which a third were very small operations of
less than RwF 3 million for which there was no Board presentation.
Promotors have often complained to IDA missions about BRD's delays in
processing their request for finance, some pointing out that BRD was
regarded as a lender of last resort, an institution to go to only if there
was no other alternative. However, it must be noted that many projects
submitted to BRD needed substantial preparatory work before they could be
appraised. Until 1981-82 when the UNDP/UNIDO supported Industrial
Promotion Bureau started to provide assistance to entrepreneurs, 4/ BRD
was the only body in Rwanda with some expertise in project preparation and
had to do the work, which in other countries is done by specialized
institutions.  It is also true that BRD's project officers do a very
comprehensive work when appraising a project, reviewing and checking all
the information provided by the promotors and this takes time in Rwanda
where things move slowly. On the other hand, BRD's priviledged position as
the major term lender in Rwanda with a strong project pipeline, does not
encourage it to be flexible to promotors. IDA discussed this issue with
BRD's new Director General who agreed that there is room for increasing
staff productivity (and thus decreasing administrative costs) and that
efforts would be made to accelerate the processing of projects and improve
the institution's image with the business community.
IV. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Operations
4.01      As of December 31, 1982, BRD has approved 246 loans totalling
RwF 3,268 million and 13 equity investments amounting to RwF 221 million.
While most of the equity investments were made before the mid-1970's, loan
approvals started to become important only in 1974 when they amounted to
RwF 163 million. Since then, they have expanded rapidly to reach a peak of
RwF 624 million in 1980, but fell in 1982 to RwF 267 million as a result of
slippage of a very large project. BRD's overall level of activity is
indeed affected by a few large projects that, as the major term lender in
Rwanda, BRD is called upon to finance. Compared to forecasts made at the
time of appraisal of the first credit, BRD's approvals increased at about
4/ However, due to UNDP's shortage of funds the Bureau may have to cease
its activities at the end of 1983.



- 10 -
the rate forecast (16% per year) in 1975-78, fell in 1979, but were 42%
higher than the level forecast in 1980 because of three large projects
approved that year for a total amount of RwF 471 million. Commitments and
disbursements lagged considerably behind approvals and represented
respectively 57% and 54% of Bank forecasts during the period 1975-80. The
main reasons for this rather poor performance included transport
difficulties, particularly during the Uganda war in 1978-79, delays of
clients in meeting BRD's disbursement conditions, and difficulties in the
execution of a few large projects. 5/   In 1981, disbursements increased
at a high rate of 76% and preliminary dates indicate that the increase was
also strong in 1982.
4.02      Characteristics of BRD's loans and equity investments approved as
of December 31, 1982 are shown in annex 5. Approvals of less than RwF 10
million accounted for 81% in number but only 10% in value. The total cost
of projects financed ranged from RwF 1.2 million to RwF 577.0 million. On
average, BRD financed about a third of the total project cost.  Eighty five
percent of the loans carried interest rates of up to 9% and maturities
ranging from 5 to 12 years. Most of these loans were granted before 1979
when BRD's interest rates were maintained at a relatively low level. Over
the last three years, most loans approved had interest rates in the range
of 10-13%. At the end of 1982, these loans represented 15% of total
approvals but 40% in value. The breakdown of BRD's operations by sector is
as follows:
Approvals
(Amounts in RwF million)
Number    %             Amount    %
Agriculture and Livestock        29       11               52       1
Agro-industry                    15        6              708      20
Manufacturing Industry           23        9              580      17
Other Industries,
Mining and Artisanat           39       15              791     23
Hotels and Tourism               11        4              165       5
Transport Equipment             126       49              621      18
Other                            16        6              572      16
Total                      259     100            3,489    100
Thirty six percent of BRD's operations, representing 79% of approval value,
were concentrated in Kigali. Other locations of importance included
Gisenyi, Ruhangeri and Cyanguru.
5/ The Air Rwanda Cargo plane project (US$2.5 million), for example, was
approved in late 1977, but only committed and disbursed in 1979
because of difficulties in finding financing. (BRD requested IDA
financing for this project under the second credit but the request
was turned down on marketing and economic grounds, and BRD had to use
local resources to finance it). Similarly, the SOMIRWA subproject
refinanced under the first IDA credit was approved by BRD's Board in
late 1976 but only committed in late 1977 because of delays in IDA
credit effectiveness and problems associated with the subproject
when it was initially submitted to IDA for review (see Annex 9).



Portfolio
4.03      At the end of December 1982, BRD's portfolio amounted to
RwF 1,709 million, of which 87% in loans and 13% in equity investments.
Loan arrears of more than 3 months amounted to RwF 17 million, i.e., less
than 1% of the portfolio, and affected 10 projects accounting for 6% of the
overall outstanding portfolio. All of the projects affected by arrears
were small and medium enterprises, with the exception of SOMIRWA, the
mining company, which is partly owned by the Government. Debts considered
doubtful or bad represented RwF 49 million, or 3% of the portfolio. To
cover potential losses, BRD has made specific provisions amounting to RwF
17 million, which is adequate as some of these loans are guaranteed by the
Government. In addition, there is a provision for general risk amounting
to RwF 50 million (3% of loans outstanding). The quality of BRD's loan
portfolio is good, and generous provisions have been set aside for possible
losses.
Financial Results and Condition
4.04      During the period 1975-80, BRD's total assets expanded at a high
rate of 20% per year, albeit slower than forecasted by the Bank appraisal
mission (26%), because of disbursement difficulties discussed in para.
4.02. In 1981 and 1982, however, the growth of total assets increased to
26% per year as disbursements picked up. All along the period 1975-82, BRD
has maintained a strong financial position. Cash expenses (administrative
costs and financial charges) were kept at a level constantly lower than
that forecasted at appraisal, while income was, most of the time, higher,
mainly as a result of the very profitable equity investment BRD made in the
MAGERWA project (Magasins Ggngraux du Rwanda) in 1969. Net profit as a
percentage of average net worth averaged 7.2%, by far exceeding the
appraisal forecasts of 5.8%, despite constitution of generous provisons for
possible losses. At the end of 1982, BRD's debt equity ratio was 0.7:1.0,
well within the 3:1 limit imposed by IDA.
V. ALLOCATION OF IDA CREDITS
Credit 655-Rw
5.01      As shown in the table below, BRD was very fast in committing IDA
funds. The credit became effective in March 1977, but at the end of the
year nearly 60% of the line of credit were already committed.
Disbursements followed closely the rate estimated at appraisal, which is
remarkable considering the much longer disbursement profile for IDF
projects in East Africa.

Table 1: Commitments and Disbursements of Credit 655-Rw
Cumulative Commitments          Cumulative Disbursements

End December 1977      2,360           59           323      8            10
1978     2,360          59         1,668      42            40
1979     4,000         100         3,207      80            75
1980     4,000         100         3,545      89           100
1981     4,000         100         3,875      97           100
5.02      The main reason for this remarkable performance is the fact that
the first IDA credit financed only 6 subloans, all above the free limit,
for 5 medium and large enterprises: SOMIRWA, a mining company in which the
Government has a 49% participation; SULFO-RWANDA, a sweet manufacturing
firm; MIRONKO (2 subloans), a plastic goods manufacturing project; BATAVIA,
a photo processing laboratory; and TOLIRWA, a plant processing corrugated
iron sheets.   One subloan used 40% of the line of credit.  Indeed, BRD has
the tendency of using IDA funds for large projects as all its other
external lines of credit carry special conditions with regard to sector or
size of projects which can be financed. This has created the problem of
over-exposure discussed in para. 3.05. Under credit 655-Rw, 2 out of the 6
subloans exceeded BRD's exposure limit of 20% of net worth. In one case,
BRD's over exposure was so large that before approving the subloan, IDA
requested that adequate supplementary guarantee be obtained from Government
(Annex 9).
5.03      Summary description of the 6 subprojects, their financial and
economic characteristics, as well as their status of implementation are
given in Annexes 6-10. The subloans carried interests rates of 7%-12%,
excluding commissions, and maturities between 6 and 12 years. All
recipients of subloans were private enterprises, with the Government
holding a minority participation in one of them. Four subprojects were new
ventures. As of December 31, 1981, the financial performance of two
subprojects was satisfactory. The three other subprojects were in deficit,
but for two of them the situation is expected to improve as production and
sales have recently increased at a fast rate.  Compared to appraisal's
schedule, implementation of most of the subprojects was delayed and all of
them incurred sizeable cost overruns.  In general, transport difficulties
and, in some cases, changes in the investment program were the main causes
of implementation delays. It should also be noted that an usually
long period of time elapsed between subproject approval by BRD's Board and
by IDA. In 4 out of the 6 subprojects, this period ranged from 9 to 13



- 13 -
months. Generally, Bank staff acted promptly and reviewed subprojects as
soon as they received them, but the need for additional information,
clarification (and, in one case, obtaining supplementary guarantees from
Government) lengthened the review period. In 2 cases, it was also due to
delays by BRD in submitting subprojects for review (4 and 8 months after
approval by BRD's Board). These implementation delays may have adversely
affected the final cost of projects, but the main cause of cost overruns
appeared to be an underestimation of costs at appraisal and changes in the
investment plan. In 3 cases, purchases of additional equipment and/or
machines not foreseen at appraisal were made. As shown in Annex 10 only
one subproject has arrears of more than 3 months.
5.04      As requested by the first IDA credit, BRD only calculated
economic rates of return for import substitution projects. They were
estimated at 11% for MIRONKO, and 15.5% for TOLIRWA. As both have been in
operation only since 1980, no actual economic rate of return is therefore
available. However, from available data, it appears that the
economic contribution of TOLIRWA has been, so far, marginal. The project
needs a ban on imports to remain in operation (TOLIRWA management and the
Government maintain that the company suffers from unfair competition. See
Annex 9) and, although it was not its main objective, job creation by
TOLIRWA was limited and very costly: 75 permanent jobs at an average cost
per job of about US$47,400. The MIRONKO project, on the other hand,
operates without special protection. The company is at present in
deficit,but its products appear competitive with imports, particularly the
beer cases which are bulky and very expensive to import. Of the 3 other
subprojects, 2 used mainly local raw materials and one exported most of its
production. As in large operations generally, subprojects financed under
the first IDA credit have a relatively high cost per job created
(US$19,500-47,400), with the possible exception of SOMIRWA where the number
of jobs created directly was limited (175), but by rehabilitating mining
operations, the project helped sustain the employment of about 7,000 wage
earners as well as several thousands artisan miners who sell their ores to
SOMIRWA.
Credit 896-Rw
5.05      Since April 1980 when this credit became effective, 86% of the
line of credit of US$5.0 million have been committed for 8 subprojects, of
which 3 below the free limit. Two subloans were over US$1 million and one,
US$21,000 short of one million.  These three subloans used about two-thirds
of the line of credit. BRD's tendency to use IDA funds for very large
projects has thus continued under the second IDA credit. This was flagged
as an issue in the Pre-mission Issues Paper of BRD III which raised the
possibility of imposing a limitation on the use of IDA funds. However, it
was recognized that BRD as the major financial institution in Rwanda cannot
but finance large projects and that IDA is at present the only institution
providing BRD with untied funds. We have nevertheless indicated to BRD our
desire to see IDA funds spread over a larger number of projects.
5.06      Unlike the first line of credit, subprojects financed under
credit 896-Rw were spread over a larger number of sectors. Only 3
subprojects were for industry and assisted firm in expanding their



- 14 -
production line (corrugated iron sheets and blankets), or start a new
operation (mattresses). Four were for tourism development in the interior,
purchase of printing materials and financing of equipment for automobile
and truck repair. The last one was to assist MAGERWA (Magasins Generaux du
Rwanda, a company in which BRD is the main shareholder) in renewing and
expanding its storage facilities which had become insufficient to meet the
country's needs. BRD's loans to these subprojects amounted to RWF 400
million (35% of total project costs) and carried interest rates of 11-13%,
excluding commissions and maturities of 5-15 years. Most of them are
completed and have started operation. They are all concentrated in Kigali
and its vicinity, with the exception of the two hotels in the interior.
VI. IDA PERFORMANCE
6.01      In 1975 when credit 655-Rw was appraised, BRD was still a young
and inexperienced development bank whose procedures and systems needed
considerable strengthening. Thus, the Credit included a number of
covenants aimed at improving BRD's efficiency and protecting its financial
position, including the obligation for BRD to (i) change its policy
statement in order not to bear any foreign exchange risk; (ii) have its
accounts audited by independent auditors; (iii) charge higher interest
rates to its subborrowers; and (iv) calculate the economic rate of return
for all import substitution projects above the free limit of US$100,000.
6.02      BRD has always been in compliance with these covenants.  Its
accounts are regularly audited by a reputable and independent auditing firm
and with IDA's support, BRD has considerably improved its appraisal and
supervision capacity, which was almost non-existent in 1975.
6.03      The flexible position taken by IDA on many occasions over the
last 7 years, including the exemption from payment of the commitment fee
granted to BRD under the first two projects and the decision not to impose
a limit on the use of IDA funds per subloan, has substantially contributed
to the fast growth and present sound financial position of BRD. This
understanding attitude has also improved IDA's relationship with BRD and
helped maintain a fruitful dialogue with BRD's management on important
policy issues, such as BRD's level and structure of interest rates. IDA
succeeded in convincing BRD to simplify its interest rate structure which
was characterized by differentiation by sector, term and profitability as
measured by the financial rate of return estimated at appraisal and to
increase all its rates to a positive level so as to improve resource
allocation and maintain BRD's profitability. One adverse result has,
however, been that IDA funds only financed a few large projects, some of
which appear marginal from an   economic point of view.  Thus, while IDA
should continue to be flexible in justifiable circumstances, it should also
maintain a close scrutiny over BRD's operations, particularly when
reviewing subprojects to ensure that IDA funds are used to the maximum
benefit for the country.

VII. CONCLUSION
7.01      The major objective that IDA set out to accomplish in this first
credit, which was to strengthen project appraisal capabilities, internal
organization and accounting procedures of BRD, has been substantially met.
Over the last seven years, BRD has achieved a rapid growth in operations
and has been very effective in mobilizing local and foreign reserves to
support its expanding activities. It has now a strong financial position,
a sound portfolio and its staff has a good understanding of project
appraisal methodology. BRD has substantially improved its accounting
systems and procedures and since 1976, its accounts are regurlarly audited
by an independent auditing firm acceptable to IDA.
7.02      BRD has not achieved the specific objective set forth in this
credit of providing technical assistance to Rwandese enterprises (para.
1.03). It has, however, made good use of the extra point spread given to
it to develop and strengthen its supervision capability which was almost
non-existent at that time. As discussed in para. 3.05, BRD did not assist
enterprises as agreed with IDA because the Bureau of Industrial Promotion,
which was supposed to be established in 1977 with UNIDO assistance, became
operational only in 1982 and, alone, BRD could not do much until its own
procedures and capabilities were reinforced. Now that BRD has gained more
experience and is embarking on an intensive effort to finance SSEs,
assistance to enterprises will become an important part of its activity.
7.03      With regard to the last objective of providing term financing to
well conceived investment project, the performance of enterprises financed
under the credit has been so far below expectations. At present, only 2
out of the 5 enterprises supported by IDA funds are financially profitable,
while the economic impact of some of them is, at best, marginal.
Admittedly, it was impossible for BRD to foresee the drastic changes in the
mineral prices over the last 2-3 years which are one of the main causes of
SOMIRWA's present difficult financial position. Nor could it foresee the
marketing difficulties encountered by the MIRONKO operation. Both
subprojects make sense from an economic point of view. This does not seem
to be the case for the TOLIRWA subproject whose products have little local
value added and could not save much on transportation costs.
7.04      All in all, BRD as a project has been generally successful.  BRD
is well known in Rwanda as an independent and efficient financial
institution with developmental objectives that it tries to carry out
seriously. With a competent management, a sound financial situation and a
relatively experienced staff, it is bound to increase its impact and role
in the development of Rwanda and deserves continued IDA support.

Credit 655-Rw
SOMIRWA - Subloan US$1,623,377; total amount disbursed: US$1,766,495
SOMIRWA (Societe des Mines du Rwanda) is the largest company in
Rwanda with a capital of RwF 893 million held by the Government (49%) and
private investors (51%), including Geomines.  SOMIRWA dominates the mining
sector in Rwanda, accounting for about 95% of the country's mining
production (mainly cassiterite, tantalite and wolgranite). The project,
which is the first of a two-phase development program, aimed at (i)
rehabilitating SOMIRWA's operations; (ii) modestly increasing production;
and (iii) carrying out further mineral exploration. BRD's loan of RwF 150
million represented about 46% of the project's estimated total cost of
RwF 328 million and financed the purchase of drills, loaders, crushers,
magnetic separators, vehicles, etc. to replace obsolescent equipment at
several locations in Rwanda.
In reviewing BRD's submission, Bank staff found that the project
was well prepared but raised two major issues: (i) the loan exceeded BRD's
exposure limit by 159%; and (ii) the loan, if approved, would use 40% of
the line of credit of US$4.0 million. However, in view of the importance
of the project to Rwanda's development, it was decided to approve the
project, provided that additional security for the part of the loan
exceeding BRD's exposure limit was obtained from Government or SOMIRWA's
shareholders. Adequate supplementary guarantee was obtained from
Government on September 19, 1977 and the project was approved on September
30, 1977. Implementation of the project had encountered difficulties. Due
to high inflation in suppliers' countries, technical problems, but also
underestimation of costs, total investment realized was 75% more than
doubled the amount forecasted at appraisal. SOMIRWA financed the cost
overrun with its cash generation which was high during 1976-79 as a result
of favorable world market conditions. Since 1980, SOMIRWA has experienced
serious difficulties due to a decline in export prices, a rise in
production costs, and adverse effects of the appreciation of the Rwandese
Franc. Export prices of cassiterite which stagnated in 1979-80 at about
pound sterling   7,200 per ton, declined by 2% in 1981, but increased by an
estimated 4% in 1982.   Expressed in local currency, however, they declined
by 12% and 9%, respectively reflecting the appreciation of the Rwandese
Franc vis-a-vis European currencies in which most of the mineral exports
are denominated. Export prices of wolgranite and tantalite showed the same
pattern over the same period. SOMIRWA's production costs increased at an
average annual rate of 20% between 1979 and 1981. This was mainly due to
(i) a liberal employment and wage policies (labor costs increased at an
average rate of3O% per year during 1979-81); (ii) ill-advised investment
decisions (since early 1982, SOMIRWA had to support the operation costs of
the smelting plant, the capacity of which largely exceeds Rwanda's current
maximum level of cassiterite production); and (iii) increases in export

taxes and electricity tariffs. As a result of these factors, SOMIRWA's
financial situation deteriorated sharply. In mid-1982, the company's
losses amounted to RwF 260 million and it had to borrow substantial
short-term bank credit to continue operating. In December 1982, SOMIRWA
reduced itsmanpower from 8,100 in March 1982 to 7,000. Discussions between
the Government and Geomines, the Belgian partner are under way to improve
the company's financial position. SOMIRWA is also preparing an investment
program for the period 1983-87 to increase production through mining
development and improvement of ore-treatment facilities. The cost of the
development program currently estimated at RwF 3.8 billion (US$41 million)
would be financed for a large part by external sources (including IFC and
EIB) but a share capital increase would also be necessary. BRD's loan was
fully disbursed in 1979. At the end of December 1982, loan outstanding
amounted to RwF 80 million, or US$860,000. Arrears of more than 3 months
totalled RwF 10 million (US$108,000).
SULFO-RWANDA. Subloan US$325,000
The purpose of the project was to help Sulfo-Rwanda, a family
company making soap, diversify its activities into sweet manufacturing.
The subloan represented 55% of the total project cost estimated at
appraisal at RwF 55 million. Due to the addition of a new machine, total
investment cost increased to RwF 73.5 million; the cost overrun was
financed by the company's cash generation. Sulfo-Rwanda is profitable and
has a good and dynamic management. Production of sweets started in 1980
and over the last three years has increased at a rate comparable to that
forecasted at appraisal. BRD's loan was fully disbursed in 1979. As of
September 30, 1982, loan outstanding amounted to RwF 27.5 million. There
is no arrear on this project.
MIRONKO. First subloan: US$402,600; Second subloan: US$283,591 net of
cancellation
Mironko Plastics Industries is entirely owned by a Rwandese
merchant, Mr. F. X. Mironko, who decided in 1976 to enter into
manufacturing. The project he submitted to BRD had two phases. The first
phase, supported by a BRD's loan of RwF 37 million, was to manufacture
plastic articles for household use; the second phase, which started in 1979
with a second BRD's loan of RwF 60 million, aimed at producing plastic beer
cases to replace wooden cases used by the breweries in Rwanda and Burundi.
During the period 1979-81, production of plastic articles fluctuated
between 175 tons to 229 tons, or only about 60% of the level forecasted at
appraisal. Mironko had difficulties selling his products because of
relatively high prices (55% higher than estimated at appraisal) and,
reportedly, competition from smuggled Kenyan products. Official exports
were also constrained by high tariff barriers in Burundi where only 2% of
total sales of RwF 989 million were sold in 1981. Production of plastic
beer cases started in 1982 to supply BRALIRWA, the brewerie in Gisenyi at a
rate of 2,500 cases per month. This should help improve the company's
financial situation which was in deficit of RwF 3.7 million in 1981. As of
September 31, 1982, total outstanding on the two loans amounted to RwF 53
million.   There was no arrears.

BATAVIA COLOR PHOTO LABORATORIES. Subloan US$109,000
The purpose of this subloan was to help Mr. Rashmikaut V.
Batavia, an Indian businessman living in Rwanda since the 1960's, establish
the first laboratory for developing color prints and slides in Kigali. The
promotor was experienced in the field, having managed a similar operation
in Kampala in the mid-1950's, and the project was expected to be highly
profitable with a financial rate of return of 23%. BRD's subloan financed
50% of total project cost estimated at appraisal at 20 million. However,
due to delays in implementation (BRD submitted the project for review to
IDA 8 months after it was approved by its Board) and the revaluation of the
D.M., total investment increased to RwF 27 million; the cost overrun was
financed by the promotor. The project is in operation since March 1979,
and so far, appear profitable. As most small-family enterprises in Rwanda,
BATAVIA's accounts are incomplete and their production often delayed. The
latest financial statements were for 1980 and showed a net profit of RwF
1.1 million, higher than what was estimated at appraisal. As of September
30, 1982, loan outstanding amounted to RwF 5.2 million, and arrears of more
than 6 months to RwF 202,000. These were, however, paid in early October
1982.
TOLIRWA. First total subloan: US$970,000
This subproject aimed at creating a new plant to process
corrugated iron sheets with inputs imported from Japan. BRD's initial
request was for a subloan of US$924,000 (35% of total project cost) which
IDA approved in September 1979. As funds remaining in Cr. 655-Rw were not
sufficient to finance the whole subloan US$280,000 were approved under the
second IDA credit. However, implementation of the project experienced
delays and resulted in a cost overrun of US$326,000 which BRD requested -
and IDA agreed - to cover with funds cancelled under another subproject
because the necessary documentation to request disbursements was
unavailable. The total amount financed under Cr. 655-Rw was therefore
US$970,000. The project started operation in June 1980, and produced 3,935
tons of corrugated iron sheets in 1981 and 5,795 tons in 1982, exceeding
the level forecasted at appraisal by 15%. Its production costs were,
however, also higher than estimated. Due to competition from imports,
TOLIRWA could not raise prices sufficiently to cover costs and incurred a
loss of RwF 3.8 million in 1981. Despite high production costs, TOLIRWA
succeeded in exporting 250 tons of iron sheets to Zaire through the
clearing arrangement existing among countries of the Great Lakes Community
in 1982 because payments were made at the official rate. 1/   This
arrangement was, however, suspended in late 1982 as Zaire did not have the
foreign exchange to settle its account with Burundi and Rwanda. Claiming
unfair competition from traders who imported poor quality, but cheap iron
sheets and practiced "ventes jumelees" (the obligation for customers buying
a high demand item from an importer to purchase also a sheet of corrugated
iron from him), TOLIRWA obtained from the Government the suspension of iron
sheet imports in 1982. With this monopoly position, it plans to produce
8,000 tons of corrugated iron sheets in 1983.
1/  Zairian enterprises importing from outside the Great Lakes Community
should obtain foreign exchange at the parallel rate which is 3-4 times
higher than the official rate. Thus even though TOLIRWA's prices were
high, they became very competitive when converted in Zaires at the
official rate.
