A. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES
A.1. Project Development Objectives and Key Performance Indicators (see Annex 1):
The project development objectives are: (i) effective and transparent management of the Government's
Privatization Program (1999-2002) including the Project; and (ii) completed privatizations of public
enterprises and assets. The proposed IDA-supported Project is an integral part of the Privatization
Program and is considered to be the first of a possible sequence of operations in Yemen designed to
support privatization transactions in cases where there is strong client commitment and ownership.

B. STRATEGIC CONTEXT
B.1. Sector-Related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Goal Supported by the Project (Annex 1):
CAS Document No.: IDA/R99-80; IFC/R99-65 (Report No. 19073-YEM of May 3, 1999)
Date of Latest CAS Discussion: May 25, 1999
The CAS objectives supported by the Project are to create a modem public administration that will
encourage and attract private sector development to help the economy grow out of poverty and
dependence on oil. The excessive presence of government in some areas has led to inefficient public
enterprise monopolies and overregulation that is constraining potential private investment and
employment. In this regard, the proposed Project is fully consistent with the CAS; its support for
privatization transactions will help to attract private sector investment and management, raise enterprise
efficiency, and reduce the fiscal and monetary burden of the public enterprise sector. It will also build
local institutional capacity to manage the Government's Privatization Program.
B.2. Main Sector Issues and Government Strategy:
Privatization is a major thrust of the Government's real sector reform program. The Government is
pursuing stabilization, structural reforms including privatization, and other improvements in public
sector management outlined in a Policy Framework Paper (PFP)1 and supported by an IMF-sponsored
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) approved in September 1997. The Government's
"Yemen - Policy Framework Paper: 1997 to 1999," No. SecM97-761, August 28, 1997.

Republic of Yemen                                                      Privatization Support Project
Privatization Program was formulated with the assistance of the IMF and IDA during the preparation of
the ESAF/PFP. The Government recognizes that credible privatization actions are essential for signaling
to the world market and investors, Yemen's commitment to economic reform and its attractiveness as a
place to do business in the Middle East. Rebalancing the economy through privatization will enable the
Government to strengthen its focus on critical economic management issues such as public sector
management and civil service reform, corporate governance, and public utility regulation. In this regard,
a recently approved Public Sector Management Adjustment Credit (Cr. 3178 of April 13, 1999) is
providing IDA assistance for public sector management reform. Privatization will also help the
Government to divert increased financial and managerial resources away from commercial activities and
towards sectors and activities where the private sector may be reluctant to enter, and where social
benefits may be high, such as education and health and social services.
The Government began privatizing enterprises in early 1995 and has so far privatized about 10 small
tourism and transport enterprises mainly through leasing, and about 50 other small, mainly agricultural
enterprises primarily through restitution to their original owners. In addition, about 20 small industrial
enterprises have been tendered for sale.
Privatization in Yemen faces challenges and constraints similar to those witnessed in other emerging
market economies. The main cross-sectoral challenges and constraints are:
a) Transparency. Transparency is the most critical issue associated with privatization in Yemen as in
other countries. To promote the principles of transparency, efficiency, and competitiveness in the
implementation of the Privatization Program, the Yemeni Parliament recently enacted a Privatization
Law in October 1999 that is consistent with these principles. The Privatization Law is considered to
be critical to the efficient implementation of the Privatization Program because it signals to investors
the Government's fundamental commitment to privatization and also clarifies and enables the
institutional and procedural framework for privatization. The Government has also recently enacted
a new Companies Law that is conducive to satisfactory privatization processes.
b) Institutional Framework.  The institutional framework for privatization requires substantial
strengthening.  The Privatization Law specifies the establishment of a High Committee for
Privatization (HCP), chaired by the Prime Minister and with membership of sector ministers, to
provide policy oversight of the Privatization Program, approve transactions, and appoint temporary
executive boards of the enterprises that are to be privatized. It also provides for the establishment of
a Technical Privatization Office (TPO), as Secretariat to the HCP, to oversee and coordinate the
Privatization Program, formulate privatization strategies, advise and assist the sector ministries in
carrying out privatization transactions, and liaise with the central ministries and other concerned
institutions such as the labor unions.
c) Labor Restructuring. Estimates of labor redundancies in Yemen's public enterprises range from
20,000 to 30,000 workers. A uniform and fair labor redundancy policy is required to attract
investors, address concerns of the labor force, and improve investor and Yemeni confidence in
privatization. Under the ESAF, a Civil Service Fund (CSF) has recently been established to manage
redundant civil service and public enterprise labor, including transitional financial support and
separation incentives. Workers made redundant will be transferred to the CSF where they will
continue to receive their current salary during a limited job-search period or until
relocation/buyout/pension arrangements are worked out in accordance with a severance package
program still to be developed. The CSF will be administered by the General Pension and Social
Security Administration, supervised by the Ministry of Finance, and funded from budgetary sources.
d) Property Claims. Legal title to property is uncertain in some cases due to the nationalizations of
the distant past. For privatization to be successful, investors need to be given clear and irrevocable
title to purchased property and not be made subject to any judicial proceedings regarding the
resolution of claims against such property. The Government is currently developing interim

procedures for implementation in 2000 that will enable clear titles and registration to be provided for
properties to be privatized, pending the development of a more comprehensive approach to land
titling issues. The Government is expected to obligate itself as owner/seller to settle financially with
former owners of nationalized property through judicial procedures if valid documentary evidence
regarding property claims is presented.
e) Local Stock Market. A World Bank Financial Sector Note2 stressed the importance of initiating an
organized stock market to help mobilize and allocate funds for longer-term investment and to widen
the participation of small investors in privatization and the direct ownership of productive assets. A
stock market would enable privatization transactions involving the sale of shares to a strategic
investor to be combined with a public share offering that would give the general public an
opportunity to participate in the transactions - an approach that has been applied successfully in
several countries with nascent capital markets, such as Morocco and Jamaica. Internationally, there
is strong evidence that privatization and the development of capital markets can be complementary -
attracting greater investor interest, broadening the base of shareholding and ownership, improving
corporate governance, and deepening the financial market and financial institutions.  The
Government has requested the Arab Monetary Fund to help formulate proposals for establishing a
simple stock market.
B.3. Sector Issues to be Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices:
To further address the cross-sectoral privatization issues described above, and to help ensure that the
project development objectives are achieved, the Project will include the following measures:
a) Transparency. The Privatization Law mandates an institutional structure with a high level of
oversight and vetting of transactions combined with checks and balances between the central
ministries (Office of the Prime Minister, and Ministries of Planning and of Finance) and the
implementing sector ministries. For each of the large enterprises targeted by the Project, the Yemeni
Cabinet has endorsed privatization strategies designed to promote transparency.  In addition,
assurances have been obtained during negotiations on: (i) a Manual of Privatization Procedures for
the TPO that sets out transparent transactions procedures and guidelines; (ii) an organizational
structure for the TPO that includes a section responsible for transparency including public disclosure
of privatization plans and transaction terms; and (iii) the recruitment of international legal advisers
to assist the HCP and the TPO in preparing enterprise and asset purchase agreements for the large
enterprises and in negotiating the agreements with prospective purchasers.
b) Institutional Framework. A major focus of the Project will be on institutional strengthening
(Section C.4). A important project design issue was how to appropriately balance the responsibility
for privatization between the central ministries and the concerned sector ministries. Initially, a
purely center-led approach was proposed which, as suggested by experience in other countries, may
offer some advantages in terms of coherence. After much debate within the Government, and as a
reflection of Yemeni societal customs, the Government considered that the support of the sector
ministries would be essential for ensuring client ownership and participation, particularly with
respect to the large transactions. In this regard, the large enterprises included in the Project were
selected on a demand-driven basis by the relevant ministerial stakeholders. The Privatization Law
therefore gives the sector ministries responsibility for implementing privatization transactions in
collaboration with the TPO, but full authority for approving the large privatization transactions is
vested in the HCP, and the TPO is required to vet each of the transactions on behalf of the HCP.
c) Labor Restructuring. Some of the large enterprise transactions, including the Aden Refinery and
the Yemen Drug Company, are expected to require labor restructuring.  The precise labor
restructuring needs and the size of the associated severance program for these transactions will

become much clearer during the course of project implementation, after financial advisers have
carried out the work necessary to prepare the transactions. Based on the implementation plans for
these transactions, a severance package program will not likely be needed before the end of 2000.
The Project, therefore, does not include funding for a severance program. Instead, donor funding
will be sought and consideration will be given to providing funding through a future IDA operation.
For any immediate needs, the CSF will fund salaries until a severance program is in place, for which
the recently approved Public Sector Management Adjustment Credit will help to make counterpart
resources available.
d) Local Stock Market. The development of a local stock market would be beneficial for the large
industrial sector transactions, but it is not critical to the achievement of the project development
objectives since most of the large enterprises targeted by the Project are expected to be privatized
through direct sales. The proposed Project includes funding for technical assistance to initiate work
on stock market development under the privatization transactions for the Yemen Cement Company
and the Yemen Drug Company.
Sector-specific privatization issues that are critical to success will be addressed by the Project on a case-
by-case basis. The privatization strategies for the large enterprises have been structured so as not to
forestall future sector reforms, and they also incorporate measures to help reduce the risks of market
capture or other market-distorting behavior following privatization. Nevertheless, the privatization
strategies are not intended to carry the burden of accountability for the implementation of longer-term
sector reform measures or for the resolution of systemic issues.

Republic of Yemen                                                       Privatization Support Project
The small and medium-sized enterprise transactions covered by the Project total about 70 enterprises
and assets in six sectors, most of which will involve a simple sale or lease of assets. With the assistance
of IDA and other international donor agencies, the Government plans to privatize or liquidate about 20
small and medium-sized enterprises in calendar year 2000, 30 enterprises in 2001, and 20 enterprises in
2002. The proposed Project includes financing for about 50 small and medium-sized enterprise
transactions.
The pre-privatization strategy work will focus on the Port of Nashtoun, the Public Telecommunications
Company, and Yemenia Airlines.
C.2. Key Policy and Institutional Reforms Supported by the Project:
The proposed Project will build upon and strengthen the Government's capacity to implement the policy
and institutional reform measures that have been enabled by the new Privatization Law. The overall
legal framework for privatization should no longer be an inhibiting factor for project viability and
sustainability.   However, the Government's ownership  and  commitment to  the expeditious
implementation of the legal framework, and to strengthening institutional capacity for privatization, will
continue to be project risk factors.
C.3. Benefits and Target Population (see Annex 6):
Privatization provides opportunities for greater private sector participation in the economy and for
improvements in the incentive structure, which together should result in overall efficiency gains. The
Government's fiscal situation should improve not only because of revenues from privatization, but also
through the elimination of inefficient operations from the Government's budget. In addition, capital
inflows should improve the current account of the balance of payments. Project beneficiaries include:
(i) the private sector, through increased business opportunities; (ii) the Government, through capital
receipts and reduced outlays of public expenditures on privatized assets; (iii) consumers, through
improved access to and quality of services; and (iv) labor, through the resolution of labor redundancy
issues and, over time, increased employment opportunities through sector reinvestment. Benefits will be
measured in accordance with the key performance indicators for the Project's development objectives
and outputs.
CA. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements:
The HCP will be responsible for overseeing the Privatization Program and for approving transactions.
The issuance of a Presidential Decree appointing the members of the HCP will be a condition for credit
effectiveness. The TPO will be the Project's main executing agency, and will be maintained within the
Office of the Prime Minister. It will oversee and coordinate the Privatization Program and the Project,
review all privatization proposals submitted to the HCP, formulate privatization strategies, advise and
assist the sector ministries in carrying out privatization transactions, liaise with the central ministries and
other concerned institutions such as the labor unions, monitor and evaluate project performance and
implementation progress in accordance with agreed development impact indicators and implementation
process indicators, and carry out seminars and other information campaigns to build and maintain
support for the Privatization Program. In addition, it will monitor compliance with Bank Group
procurement guidelines, credit covenants, budgets and expected costs at completion, and project
accounts (including commitments and disbursements), and participate in IDA supervision missions. The
issuance of a Presidential Decree legally establishing the TPO will be a condition for credit
effectiveness.

Republic of Yemen                                                    Privatization Support Project
In 1996, IDA provided initial support for the operational establishment of the TPO through an IDF grant.
Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that the TPO will be maintained with an
organizational structure, staffing and terms of reference satisfactory to IDA. The Chief Operating
Officer (COO), a Privatization Program Manager and an Accounting and Finance Manager have been
competitively recruited and appointed to the TPO. A competitive recruitment process for other key TPO
positions is currently underway. In addition, most of the sector ministries have established Privatization
Steering Committees (PSCs), chaired by the responsible sector minister, and advised and assisted by the
TPO, to carry out the transactions under each ministry's purview.
Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that the Project will be carried out in accordance
with a detailed Project Implementation Plan, acceptable to IDA, that includes target dates of actions to
be taken and monitorable indicators. In addition, a Mid-Term Review will be convened by September
30, 2001, for which the TPO will prepare a detailed mid-term report by June 30, 2001. The Review will
assess: (i) progress to date; (ii) performance against monitorable indicators; (iii) the validity of each of
the Project's critical assumptions and risks (Section F.2); and (iv) any specific implementation problems.
If necessary, adjustments to project components and procedures will be made to improve project
implementation.
The Government, through the TPO, will: (i) establish and maintain project accounts (including a Special
Account with an authorized allocation of US$900,000) in formats and under terms and conditions
acceptable to IDA; (ii) have them audited each fiscal year in accordance with IDA guidelines by an
independent auditor acceptable to IDA; and (iii) furnish the audit reports to IDA within six months of the
end of each fiscal year. The TPO will also maintain separate records and accounts for withdrawals made
on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs), and have them included in the annual audit for which
the auditors will be required to provide a separate opinion as to whether the SOEs, together with the
procedures and internal controls, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals. It will also
furnish IDA with detailed quarterly reports summarizing, inter alia: progress in privatization actions, by
ministry, enterprise, mode of privatization, and schedules; meeting proceedings, key decisions and
actions of the HCP; staffing and other actions by the TPO and the PSCs; and privatization activities of
other donors.
A condition for credit effectiveness will be the establishment within the TPO of an accounting and
financial management system, acceptable to IDA, that will facilitate effective financial management and
disbursement under the Project within the framework of IDA's traditional disbursement procedures. In
addition, while this system is in operation, assurances have been obtained during negotiations that the
Government will also carry out a time-bound action plan, acceptable to IDA, that will further strengthen
the TPO's financial management system (Annex 5). By not later than June 30, 2000, the TPO will be
expected to begin preparing quarterly Project Management Reports (PMR), acceptable to IDA, to start
full PMR-based financial management and disbursement procedures in compliance with the Loan
Administrative Change Initiative (LACI).
D. PROJECT RATIONALE
D.1. Project Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection:
The following design options were considered and rejected:
a) Adjustment Operation. The option of an adjustment operation was rejected because experience in
other countries suggests that privatization is a labor intensive process that does not lend itself to
definite timelines. Large privatization transactions such as those that will be targeted by the Project
require substantial detailed preparation work, and timetables are frequently affected by external

factors that cannot be accurately estimated or predicted. In Yemen, readily available skills and
experience in privatization are scarce, and substantial institutional strengthening will be required for
the Government to carry out the Privatization Program. The time required for building institutional
capacity and for completing some of the large transactions is expected to be much longer than that
usually associated with an adjustment operation.
b) Restructuring of Public Enterprises. This option was rejected because experience worldwide
suggests that the restructuring of public enterprises, without bringing in private ownership and
management, is less likely to lead to sustainable improvements in enterprise performance. Nor can
restructuring alone be expected to attract the large amounts of private investment that are necessary
to rehabilitate and expand the Yemeni enterprises to meet anticipated demand.
c) Continued Ad-hoc Privatization Funding. This option was rejected because it would not be
consistent with the Government's objective to accelerate and expand the scope of its Privatization
Program.

D.3. Lessons Learned and Reflected in Proposed Project Design:
Lessons learned from Bank Group-assisted privatization programs around the world include the
importance of:
a) strong government commitment to, and leadership of, the privatization process;
b) knowledgeable and effective implementation units with explicit central authority to carry out their
mandates;
c) emphasis on participation, empowerment, use of specialized consultants, and performance indicators
in institutional development efforts;
d) addressing worker concerns in an explicit and proactive manner through integration into the
privatization process and through uniform and fair severance packages;
e) effective use of counterpart funding and high stakeholder involvement;
f) ensuring transparency in privatization processes;
g) ensuring that business environment issues are addressed effectively;
h) flexible and achievable privatization targets;
i) promoting broad participation and creating an atmosphere of ownership and participation by all
constituents;
j) simplified and streamlined procurement procedures; and
k) quick responses by the Bank Group to project design and implementation problems.
Other important lessons specific to projects in Yemen include the importance of:
a) clearly defined and coherent institutional and implementation arrangements;
b) the recruitment of project management through open competition; and
c) ensuring project management is in place prior to Board presentation.
The design of the Project seeks to reflect these lessons, in part by:
a) reconfirming the Government's commitment to and leadership of the program. This is exemplified
in part by the enactment of the Privatization Law prior to Board presentation, which endows the
TPO and other concerned institutions with the explicit authority to carry out the privatization
mandate, and by the appointment of the HCP prior to credit effectiveness;
b) the demand-driven selection of the large enterprises to be targeted by the Project by the relevant
stakeholders, and by the endorsements of the preliminary privatization strategies for each of the
large enterprises by the Cabinet and the concerned sector ministries prior to Board presentation;
c) the recruitment and appointment through open competition of qualified and experienced staff to key
positions in the TPO prior to Board presentation;
d) the continued integration of labor unions in the privatization process through their inclusion in
discussions and through continued information sharing and consultation, especially on the issue of
designing severance packages;
e) the flexible progression of privatization transactions; and
f) educating and integrating government, public enterprise management, and labor through seminars,
training and consultation.
D.4. Indications of Borrower Commitment and Ownership:
The Government has demonstrated considerable commitment and ownership to the Privatization
Program and the Project through:
a) agreement with the IMF on a three-year privatization program in the context of the ESAF/PFP;
b) enactment of a Privatization Law that is consistent with the principles of transparency, efficiency
and competitiveness;

c) declaring its commitment to the Program in a Privatization Policy Letter (Annex 7);
d) establishment of the TPO;
e) establishment of Privatization Steering Committees in some of the sector ministries, including the
Ministries of Oil and Gas, Agriculture, and Industry;
f) Cabinet-level endorsement of privatization strategies for the large enterprises included in the
Project;
g) proceeding with the selection of consultants to help prepare the Aden Refinery Company for
privatization. A consultant contract is currently being negotiated;
h) inviting expressions of interest from consultants for privatization work on the four other large
enterprise transactions included in the Project;
i)  inviting expressions of interest to consultants for privatization work on several small transactions,
e.g. National Tanning Factory (Aden), Agricultural Machinery Rental Station (Abyan), Yemen
Navigation Lines and Shagra Fish Canning Factory; and
j)  completion of a significant number of small transactions in the tourism, transportation and industrial
sectors.
D.5. Value Added of Bank Group Support:
The Bank Group is among the best able of donors to bring a multi-sector perspective to privatization
transactions and international "best practice" experience to bear on project design. The Project's focus
on large, complex transactions is where Bank Group advice and participation can be most beneficial,
where the credibility of Yemen's privatization actions in the world market and to investors will be most
apparent and pronounced, and where non-local investors (both expatriate Yemenis and foreigners) will
be attracted. Bank Group participation should help to send a strong confidence-building signal to the
world market that should enhance the willingness of investors to participate in the privatization
transactions and of international donor agencies to provide support. IDA's recent economic and
financial sector operations have played a major role in assisting the Government to address the business
environment issues that arise during the course of the privatization transactions. In the absence of IDA
participation, the Project's expected benefits would likely be realized much later and in reduced
quantity.
E. PROJECT ANALYSES
E.1. Estimated Benefits and Fiscal Impact (see Annex 6):
Privatization generally brings about a broad range of benefits to the economy, and to workers and
consumers, which are difficult to quantify. The kinds of benefits that are expected to be derived from the
privatization of the large enterprises targeted by the Project are illustrated in Annex 6.
The CAS-level objective of the Project is to attract private sector-led growth and investment, raise
enterprise efficiency, and reduce the fiscal and monetary burden of public enterprises. Within this
objectives framework, the main sector benefits expected to be received from the privatization of the large
enterprises targeted by the Project are as follows:
a) Private Provision of Infrastructure. The privatization of utilities and other large enterprises
through direct sales to strategic investors can attract private investment for expansion and generate
immediate revenues that can be utilized for other public sector investments. Such transactions are
often accompanied by agreements with new investors and owners to meet specified investment or
output targets. This is expected to apply to the Aden Refinery and the Yemen Cement Company
transactions in particular.

Republic of Yemen                                                          Privatization Support Project
b) Enterprise Efficiency. Although little evidence is available to compare pre- and post-privatization
performance in Yemen, public enterprises in Yemen generally confront the same kinds of problems
as do public enterprises in other countries (e.g., administrative interventions, excessive focus on
procedures, poorly designed incentive systems, limited autonomy, and inadequate capital). A large
body of research tends to support the thesis that privatization should lead to greater enterprise
efficiency.
c) Fiscal Consolidation. The budgetary burden of some of the large enterprises targeted by the Project
is high (e.g., General Land Transport Corporation). Given the Government's commitment to check
public expenditures, further reduce the fiscal deficit, and "grow out" of external debt, privatization is
expected to be instrumental in consolidating the fiscal situation and improving public finances. The
Privatization Law requires privatization proceeds to be transferred to the Treasury where they can be
used to further reduce fiscal pressures.
Privatization is expected to have a significant positive fiscal impact. Loss-making and inefficient public
sector enterprises impose a considerable strain on the Government's budget and on society as a whole.
Privatization in Yemen should improve the government's financial flows by: raising revenue from the
sale of assets and shares; reducing the need for operating subsidies and investment capital; and increasing
tax revenues as a result of improved enterprise performance.
The Net Present Value of the expected fiscal benefits is estimated to be approximately US$500 million,
assuming a discount rate of 10 percent. This estimate excludes the fiscal benefits expected to be
generated by the Project's transactions support for the privatization of small and medium enterprises.
Since the total project cost is estimated at US$16 million, the transaction cost of around 3 percent of total
benefits falls within an acceptable range of I to 10 percent. Moreover, it can be further hypothesized
that, should the margin of error of the analysis be in the range of 50 percent, the fiscal benefits and pay-
back on the privatization would still be substantial.
E.2. Financial:
There are no major financial issues associated with project design. However, significant financial issues
are likely to arise during the course of the preparation for sale of the targeted enterprises by
legal/financial transactions and advisory consultants. The assessments carried out during this preparation
stage cover:  (i) asset valuation; (ii) financial administration within the targeted enterprises; (iii)
operational and financial projections and sensitivity analyses; (iv) financial restructuring requirements;
(v) enterprise valuation; and (vi) the financial structure of the transaction.
E.3. Technical:
Privatization strategies have been formulated for each of the five largc einterprises in consultation with the
concerned ministries and enterprises, and they have been endorsed by the Yemeni Cabinet. Each
enterprise strategy identifies the likely mode and process of privatization together with the associated
issues in the business environment that will need to be addressed. Each enterprise strategy, however, will
be revalidated by transactions consultants during the course of project implementation.  During
negotiations, assurances were obtained on the adoption of a Manual of Privatization Procedures that
specifies transparent transactions procedures to be used by the TPO. The issuance a Manual satisfactory
to IDA will be a condition for credit effectiveness.
Terms of reference have been prepared for financial/legal transactions advisors to complete a full
strategic review (including marketing strategy and valuation), prepare the assets for sale, and tender the
assets. The list of small and medium-sized enterprises and assets included in the Privatization Program

Republic of Yemen                                                        Privatization Support Project
has been formulated in the context of the ESAF/PFP program. The TPO is currently negotiating a
consultant contract for the first phase of the Aden Refinery transaction. It has also invited expressions of
interest from transaction advisers for the other large enterprise transactions.
E.4. Institutional:
The quality of the Project's institutional arrangements for project management and implementation will
be critical to the achievement of its development objectives. Existing institutional capacity and inter-
ministerial coordination require substantial strengthening, and have been cited as project risk factors. As
described in Section C.4 above, project preparation activities focused heavily on the enactment of the
Privatization Law prior to Board presentation, and the strengthening of the TPO and the PSCs in the
sector ministries, to ensure that an adequate level of institutional capacity is in place for an efficient
project start-up. In Yemen, governance problems, political factors, shortages of qualified local
consultants, and other dysfunctions have constrained fast and effective institutional development in the
past. Only recently has the TPO been permitted to recruit local consultants and to pay salaries
competitive with those in the private sector. Building institutional capacity is therefore expected to be a
lengthy process requiring substantial training of local staff and the participation of foreign advisers
(particularly short-term). To help improve the quality of the project at entry and its prospects for success,
project preparation activities also focused on: (i) developing project championship and ownership by the
Office of the Prime Minister and the concerned sector ministries, especially for the large enterprise
transactions; (ii) promoting institutional learning through active participation of the staff of the TPO and
the sector ministries in the strategic assessments of the targeted, large enterprises; and (iii) identifying
qualified Yemeni consultants for recruitment by the TPO and the sector ministries. Assurances have been
obtained during negotiations on: (i) the organization, staffing and terms of reference of the TPO; (ii)
monitoring and reporting processes for project implementation; and (iii) measures for the further
strengthening of the TPO's financial management system (section C.5). To assist project preparation,
Japan approved a US$450,000 PHRD grant to help finance consultant services to strengthen the
institutional framework and to initiate work on privatization transactions.
E.5. Social:
Potential social issues that could arise during project implementation relate mainly to the incidence of
labor redundancies. The labor unions have been supportive of the privatization program, but since a
redundancy package is not yet in place, opposition from the unions could arise. Gender issues could also
arise because of the potentially higher incidence of redundancies on women than on men, due to their
relatively higher employment rates in the public sector. In addition, North-South employment disparity
issues could arise, due to the higher concentration of public enterprises in southern Yemen than in
northern Yemen. These issues will be mitigated primarily through the establishment of the CSF and
ultimately through the development of a severance package program. In addition, the labor unions will
be integrated into decision-making processes to the extent possible, and, in some of the privatization
transactions, potential opposition from labor may be further mitigated through the incentive use of
employee stock ownership plans. Social impact monitoring will be carried out under the Project to help
ensure that implementation of labor restructuring is efficient and equitable and that the burden of
restructuring is not borne disproportionately by any special groups in society.
E.6. Environmental Assessment:
The Project is classified in environmental category "C", since it is a technical assistance operation with
objectives to change the ownership of assets to the private sector and to promote improvements in
enterprise efficiency. However, to the extent that environmental issues become apparent during the



Project Appraisal Document                                                              Page 13

strategic screening of the large transactions, such as the Aden Refinery and the Yemen Cement Company,
requirements for environmental audits will be incorporated into the transactions support provided by the
Project. Environmental liabilities will also be clarified in the context of the privatization strategy for each
large transaction. Particular attention will be paid during implementation to ensure that audits of
adequate quality are carried out for those transactions in which the Government accepts significant
environmental liabilities.
E.7. Participatory Approach:
During Program and Project preparation, the labor unions were consulted frequently, and the Cabinet and
Parliament debated the Privatization Law (which sets out the modalities of the privatization process)
extensively. In addition, the TPO, with the assistance of UNIDO/UNDP, organized and held public
workshops on privatization. A study tour on privatization was also organized for selected members of
Parliament. During project implementation, public awareness campaigns and stakeholder surveys will be
carried out by the TPO.

F. SUSTAINABILITY AND RISKS
F.1. Sustainability:
The most relevant sustainability issues are: (i) the risk of government intervention in companies after
privatization; (ii) the fiscal sustainability of the CSF and proposed severance schemes; and (iii) the
willingness of the Government to budget for the expertise required to continue carrying out privatization
transactions after project completion. The enactment of the Privatization Law, combined with the
anticipated increases in private sector investment, should reduce the risk of government intervention. The
sustainability of the CSF will be monitored by the ESAF, and any required corrective measures will be
taken during project implementation. In addition, the Project is expected to increase government
privatization skills and knowledge, build local institutional capacity, help cement the legal framework for
privatization, and provide initial support for the development of a simple stock market, all of which
should facilitate a continuation of effective privatization transactions.

F.3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
In addition to the social and environmental issues referred to above, potential controversial issues relate
to:
a) Transparency: Should the Privatization Program not be implemented transparently, investors will be
dissuaded from bidding on enterprises offered for sale. This issue will be mitigated through: the
measures described in section B.3; close IDA supervision; the employment of qualified financial and
legal advisors; and IDA resolve to suspend the Project if necessary because of transparency issues.

Republic of Yemen                                                   Privatization Support Project
b) Political Opposition: There is some potential for political opposition to privatization to arise as a
result of vested interests in the sector ministries, especially if there is a lack of transparency in the
transactions. This issue is being mitigated by the Project's risk minimization measures (section F.2),
particularly by the demand-driven approach to the selection of targeted assets and by the participatory
approach to project preparation.

Annex 2
Detailed Project Description
Introduction
The proposed Privatization Support Project will assist the Government in implementing its Privatization
Program covering the period from 1999 to 2002. It's primary development objectives comprise: (i)
efficient and transparent management by the Government of its Privatization Program (1999-2002); and
(ii) completed privatizations of public enterprises and assets.  The project comprises four main
components:
a)    Institutional Support for Program and Project Management (US$3.7 Million): Local and
foreign consulting and technical assistance services, training, facilities and equipment to strengthen the
Technical Privatization Office (TPO) and the concerned sector ministries managing the implementation
of the Project and the privatization transactions. In accordance with the Privatization Law, the TPO will
serve as the Secretariat to the High Committee for Privatization (HCP), coordinate the Government's
overall privatization program, review all privatization proposals submitted to the HCP, formulate
privatization strategies, and advise and assist the sector ministries in the implementation of privatization
transactions. The initial staff of the TPO will comprise: (i) Chief Operating Officer (COO), who will be
assisted by one internationally recruited Transaction Advisor; (ii) Program Managers; (iii) Manager,
Accounting and Financial Administration; and (iv) Manager, Legal Affairs. Privatization Steering
Committees (PSCs) will also be established in the concerned sector ministries. The Project will provide
funding for competitively recruited, international and local consultants to staff and support the TPO and
the PSCs in carrying out the privatization transactions. The component's deliverable/output objective is a
strengthened TPO and sector ministries capable of managing and implementing the Government's
Privatization Program (1999-2002).
b)    Transactions Support - Large Enterprises (US$7.1 Million): Financial and legal transactions
advisory services for the preparation for sale of large enterprise assets, which are expected to require the
assistance of international consulting firms. Consulting services will also be provided to help address
associated policy and regulatory issues necessary for creating a competitive market environment and
efficient and effective operations of the newly privatized enterprises, and for the marketing and tendering
of the enterprises. The component's deliverable/output objective is bringing to the point of sale at least
three of the five large enterprises targeted by the Project, including any necessary legal, regulatory,
environmental and labor restructuring measures. The following large enterprises will be targeted by the
Project:
(i) Ministry of Industry:
*   Yemen Corporation for Cement Production and Marketing (viz., Yemen Cement
Company)
*   Yemen Drug Company
(ii) Ministry of Oil and Mineral Resources:
*   Aden Refinery Company
(iii) Ministry of Transport:
*   Airport passenger and cargo ground-handling services at international airports
*   General Land Transport Corporation
Privatization strategies for these enterprises have been prepared and endorsed by the Government. Each
enterprise strategy identifies the likely mode and process of privatization, the associated issues in the
business environment that would be addressed during the course of privatization, and the implementation

process and schedule. The policy and regulatory measures are expected to include initial preparatory
work for a simple stock market for trading of shares in enterprises such as the Yemen Cement Company
and the Yemen Drug Company. The strategies will be revalidated by transactions consultants during the
course of project implementation.
c)    Transactions Support - Small and Medium Enterprises (US$3.8 Million): Financial and
legal transactions advisory services for the preparation for sale of about 50 small and medium-sized
enterprise assets, and for the marketing and tendering of the assets. Such services could include those
required for any associated policy and regulatory issues should that be necessary for creating a
competitive market environment and efficient and effective operations of the newly capitalized/privatized
enterprises. The enterprise transactions supported under this component will be selected in agreement
with IDA out of approximately 70 small and medium-sized enterprises included in the Government's
Privatization Program. The component's deliverable/output objective is to bring to the point of sale about
half of these enterprises and assets. Priority in the utilization of the IDA credit will be given to the more
difficult and complex assets included in the Privatization Program, such as the Yemen Economic
Corporation, Foreign Trade and Grain Corporation, National Dockyards Company, Canning Factories in
Mukallah and Shagra, and the Marib Oil Refinery. Invitations for expressions of interest to consultants
have been issued for many small and medium enterprise transactions; e.g. National Tanning Factory
(Aden), Agricultural Machinery Rental Station (Abyan), Yemen Navigation Lines and Shagra Fish
Canning Factory.
d)    Pre-Privatization Strategy Work on Large Enterprises (US$1.4 Million): Financial advisory
services for pre-privatization work on three large transactions - Port of Nashtoun, Public
Telecommunications Company, and Yemenia Airlines.
Summary of Privatization Strategies for the Large Enterprises
a)    Process and Methodology. In consultation with the concerned sector ministries, Bank staff
assisted the Government in preparing privatization strategies for each of the five large enterprises
included in the Project. The strategies were then reviewed and endorsed by the Yemeni Cabinet. It is
important to note, however, that changes and adjustments may need to be made as the actual privatization
process unfolds. Furthermore, the privatization strategies do not seek to resolve longer-term sector
reform strategy issues, but have been structured so as not to forestall future sector reforms. In most
cases, the objective of each strategy is to initiate steps towards developing a comprehensive policy and
institutional framework that is consistent with a long-term vision of the concerned sector.
b)    Aden Refinery. The Aden Refinery Company (ARC) is a government-owned enterprise that
reports to the Ministry of Oil and Mineral Resources. It is the largest employer in Yemen with a staff of
over 4000. It is poorly designed, and not configured to process local hydrocarbons. Therefore it operates
well below its capacity, and needs technological and operational modernization. ARC sells all of its
product to Yemen Petroleum Company (YPC), and YPC in turn, is the sole distributor of petroleum
products in the domestic market.
The Government's objectives for privatizing ARC are to:
* finance the modernization of the refinery; and
* eliminate subsidies in the refining sector.
The proposed privatization strategy entails:
*  issuing new shares in return for capital contribution by new investors;

Republic of Yemen                                                       Privatization Support Project
*  inviting an experienced internationally recognized refinery operator to take a controlling
interest in the refinery;
*  using the proceeds from selling shares as well as new corporate debt to finance investments
in ARC; and
*  promoting market principles and the eventual deregulation of downstream activities in the
petroleum sector.
c)     Airport Ground-Handling Services. Yemeni Airlines, the national flag carrier, currently
carries out all ground handling operations such as passenger traffic; luggage handling; aircraft cleaning;
airport cleaning; catering and equipment support and service. There are six international airports in
Yemen, in Sana'a, Taiz, Aden, Sayun, Hodeidah and Al Mukallah. Ground handling has the potential to
be one of the most profitable components of the aviation sector.
The Government's objectives for privatizing ground handling operations are to:
* provide more efficient ground handling services at international airports in Yemen;
* improve the quality of services provided by introducing competition;
* increase density of traffic destined to and originating from Yemen; and
* compete with regional airports for transit and air traffic as well as other services such as
package delivery (e.g. DHL and Federal Express).
The proposed privatization strategy entails:
joint share-holding and/or revenue sharing between the government and commercial entities;
* bidding out services thereby stimulating market competition and realizing gains in areas such
as government revenue (fees and charges), efficiency gains, and rents;
* increasing traffic to/from Yemen, thereby generating increased airport revenues; and
developing Sana'a into a regional transit hub by enabling airlines to provide their clients with
timely service in an efficient and high quality manner.
d)     General Land Transport Company. The General Land Transport Company (GLTC) is a
publicly-owned enterprise that provides bus and freight (trucking) services in Yemen, and is supervised
by the Minister of Transportation. GLTC has been successful at providing a large array of services
thereby connecting urban and remote parts of the country. However, it continues to suffer from financial
difficulties and its vehicle fleet suffers from acute depreciation.
The Government's objectives for privatizing GLTC are to:
* achieve efficiency in operations by drawing upon the private sector's entrepreneurial skill;
* attract immediate investment;
* provide affordable transportation to the population; and
* reduce the government's fiscal burden through subsidies and unfruitful services.
The proposed privatization strategy entails:
*  restructuring the company strategically, and down-sizing to match current market realities,
then recapitalizing with private sector capital;
*  developing a detailed business plan which clearly identifies strategic assets and steps that
should be taken to protect and maximize these assets;
*  privatizing GLTC creating a joint-stock limited liability company that is partially funded by
capital from GLTC and by government funding. Additional funds may be provided by
employees through an employee stock ownership plan (about 10 percent) and other strategic
investors (60 percent) which would choose management staff. The remaining 30 percent

equity position held by the Government may later be sold to employees, strategic investors
and/or to the public by way of a stock flotation.
e)     Yemen Cement Company. The Yemen Cement Company (YCC) is a 100 percent state-owned
enterprise that is composed of three profitable plants in Amran, Bajel and Albarh in northern Yemen, that
have access to unlimited raw materials and adequate water supplies. Furthermore, they have training
facilities and skilled personnel.  In some cases, the technology in the plants is out-dated and
environmentally detrimental. The accounting system is manual, and outdated.
The Government's objectives for privatizing YCC are to:
* increase the sector's overall efficiency and output level;
* improve the balance of payments strain caused by importing significant quantities of cement;
* attract investment and create new employment opportunities for Yemeni nationals; and
* maintain and update existing technology bringing about greater efficiency, consumer welfare,
and cleaner production.
The proposed privatization strategy entails:
* conducting detailed assessments of the plants' operational, financial, management and
engineering structures;
* carrying out comprehensive feasibility studies on the potential for expanding production
taking into account market, financial and technological factors;
* determining the value of each plant and recommending the debt and equity investment
required for each plant; and
* capitalization by way of issuing shares to strategic investors and the sale of government
equity to a broad base of shareholders.
I)    Yemen Drug Company. The Yemen Drug Company (YDC) is part of the mixed sector, with 40
percent of its shares owned by the Ministry of Industry; 35 percent owned by the Yemen Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (YBRD) and 25 percent privately owned. It is a profitable enterprise
with a broad base of operations including producing drugs, serving as an import agent for leading drug
companies in Europe, printing drug labels, and distributing products to pharmacies around the country.
The Government's objectives for privatizing YDC are to:
* ensure that a wide range of high quality drugs are available;
* encourage competition in the industry by removing import and price controls;
* increase the efficiency and effectiveness of YDC; and
* develop the wealth base in the country by expanding the public shareholding of YDC from
25 percent to 100 percent.
The proposed privatization strategy entails:
* attracting a strategic investor who will have considerable management control;
* supporting the development of a simple stock exchange, and, when possible,
* floating the remaining company shares on the stock exchange in order to promote a broad-
based shareholding.

4 Costs were estimated at March 1999 prices. The cost estimates include about US$500,000 equivalent in taxes on local costs
which comprise mainly consultant services, but exclude taxes on foreign consultant services, for which the Government is
considering an exemption. The cost estimates are based on recent contracts. The price contingencies are based on estimated
annual inflation of 3 percent in foreign costs and 7 percent in local costs.

Annex 5
Procurement, Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements
Assurances have been obtained during negotiations regarding the procurement, financial management
and disbursement arrangements described below.
Procurement
a)    Procurement Methods (Table A).  The project elements, their estimated costs, and the
procurement arrangements for the components to be financed by IDA are shown in Table A. All IDA-
financed technical assistance, consultant services, goods and facilities will be procured under the relevant
World Bank Guidelines. Consultant and training services will be procured in accordance with World
Bank "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers," published in
January 1997 and revised in September 1997 and January 1999. Goods will procured in accordance with
World Bank "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits," published in September
1997 and January 1999. Procurement of goods is expected to be modest and to comprise only a few
items of equipment and vehicles. The aggregate amount is estimated at about US$100,000 equivalent. In
addition, the Project includes financing for incremental operating costs of about US$700,000 equivalent.
Procurement procedures would be either International Shopping (IS) or National Shopping (NS) as
appropriate. They would be based on at least three price quotations and, where relevant, from at least two
eligible countries.
b)    Prior Review Thresholds (Table B). The threshold for prior review would be US$75,000 for
contracts for goods, US$100,000 for contracts with consulting firms, and US$50,000 for contracts with
individual consultants. The contract review arrangements are summarized in Table B.
Financial Management and Disbursements
a)    Financial Management. The TPO will be responsible for overall project financial management
and accounting. It will maintain books of account for the Project, prepare and disseminate financial
statements and financial management reports, and ensure the timely audit of the financial statements.
Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that the Government will establish, prior to credit
effectiveness, a financial management system, acceptable to IDA, that is adequate to reflect the
operations, resources and expenditures related to the Project and enable the TPO to produce Project
Management Reports (PMRs) that are sufficient for effective financial management and disbursement
under IDA's traditional disbursement procedures. In addition, an Accounting and Financial Manager has
been competitively recruited and appointed by the TPO to manage and operate the system. Draft terms of
reference for the financial audit of the Project have been prepared and the process of recruitment of a
private auditor acceptable to IDA has been initiated. The private auditor will be appointed prior to credit
effectiveness.
While the above system is in operation, assurances have been obtained during negotiations that
the Government will also carry out a time-bound action plan, acceptable to IDA, that will further
strengthen the TPO's financial management system. It will include the preparation and implementation
of new PMR formats, the installation of a computer-based financial management system, and related
training. By not later than June 30, 2000, the TPO will be expected to begin preparing quarterly PMRs,
acceptable to IDA, that incorporate full PMR-based financial management and disbursement procedures
in compliance with the Loan Administrative Change Initiative (LACI).

Republic of Yemen                                                   Privatization Support Project
A summary of the financial reporting requirements is as follows:
(i)    The books and records of the TPO will be maintained according to the International
Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC)
and will be duly noted in the financial statements submitted for audit. The independent auditor
will be a member of a professional body that is accredited by the International Federation of
Accountants (IFAC) or its equivalent. Audits will be conducted in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing.
(ii)   Reports to be submitted for annual audit include Report 1-A, Summary of the Project's
Sources and Uses of Funds; Report l-B, Expenditure by Activity Funded from All Sources;
Report 1-E, IDA Credit Special Account Statement; and also required footnotes to the financial
statements including the schedule of withdrawals from the proposed IDA credit.
(iii)   Starting on January 1, 2000 for the period ended December 31, 1999, quarterly PMRs
will be submitted to IDA and, starting with the quarter ending March 2000, additional reports to
be submitted quarterly include Report 2-A, Output Monitoring Report; Report 2-B, Impact
Indicators; Report 3-A, Procurement Management for Goods and Civil Works; and Report 3-B,
Procurement for Management of Consulting.
b)    Allocation of Credit Proceeds and Estimated Credit Disbursements (Tables C and D). The
Project will be implemented over approximately four years from the estimated date of credit
effectiveness, with a target completion date of June 30, 2003. The Closing Date of the IDA credit is
December 31, 2003, six months after the project completion date. The estimated disbursement schedule
is given in Table C. The proposed credit will be disbursed against the project components as shown in
Table D.
c)    Special Account. To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account (SA) will be established by the
Borrower in a commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association. The SA would
be maintained by the TPO as a separate identifiable account to be used exclusively for project
expenditures. IDA would, upon request, make an authorized allocation of US$900,000. Initially, and
until total disbursements reach SDR1.5 million, the allocation would be limited to US$300,000.
Replenishment applications would be submitted on a monthly basis. The replenishment applications
would be supported by the necessary documentation; i.e., a bank statement of the SA and a reconciliation
bank statement of the SA against IDA records. The SA and Statements of Expenditures would be audited
annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and their report would be submitted to IDA within
six months after the end of each fiscal year. In managing the SA, the TPO would maintain separate
accounting records, by project component, to facilitate disbursement, monitoring and reconciliation of the
use of funds. In addition, the TPO's accounting records for the large enterprise transactions component
and the small enterprise transactions component would be further disaggregated by either enterprise or
Ministry.
d)    Use of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Disbursements out of the Special Account for
contracts below the prior review threshold would be made on the basis of SOEs. Documentation to
support expenditures financed under SOEs would be maintained by the Borrower and made available for
review by IDA supervision missions.

Annex 6
Estimated Benefits and Fiscal Impact
Introduction
The proposed Privatization Support Project is expected to benefit the economy in various ways, including
attracting more investment, encouraging competition, and bringing about greater consumer welfare.
Public enterprise operations are often ineffective and inefficient. Privatization is expected to help the
economy by generating revenue for the government and alleviating fiscal pressures; reducing consumer
costs and increasing choice; improving efficiency, productivity and profitability across sectors; and
contributing to the development of a capital market for debt and equity. These potential benefits are
summarized for the large enterprises in a qualitative manner in Table A below. Similar kinds of benefits
are expected to be generated by the Project's transactions support for the privatization of small and
medium enterprises.

Republic of Yemen                                                          Privatization Support Project
Fiscal Evaluation
A quantitative discussion of the estimated fiscal benefits from the privatization of the large enterprises is
given below and summarized in Table B. In carrying out this analysis, a number of assumptions have
been made. In instances where data was limited, or not available, staff estimates have been based on
conservative evaluations and on research and data collected from the privatization of similar enterprises
in other countries. Staff assumptions related to Yemeni market conditions have also been taken into
account. Therefore, the estimates should be treated as approximate indicators only. The counterfactual is
implied in this analysis, and then summarized separately.
a)     Aden Refinery Company
Privatization of the Aden Refinery Company (ARC) is expected to encourage investment which could be
used for maintaining existing technology, and to facilitate a move towards newer, more efficient facilities.
Investment is also necessary for ARC to address critical environmental and safety issues, and improve
overall operational efficiency. The privatization of ARC is also expected to promote deregulation of
downstream activities, inviting increased competition. Currently, ARC sells all of its product to the
Yemen Petroleum Company (YPC) which has a monopoly on the distribution of petroleum products in
domestic markets.
Labor productivity and working conditions in the refinery are also expected to improve with privatization,
and a Labor Redundancy Fund has been established to assist affected workers.  Proceeds from
privatization may be injected into the Fund in the short-term.
ARC currently represents a fiscal drain on the Government, due to product subsidies and operational
inefficiencies. Privatization is expected to lead to greatly reduce this fiscal drain, which is estimated to
total somewhere between US$40 million and US$100 million per annum.5 Furthermore, the refinery has
potential to contribute an additional US$10 million to the budget, through revenue from dividends and
taxes in the medium term.
b)     Airport Ground-Handling Services
Airport passenger and cargo ground-handling services have the potential to become a more significant
source of income for the Govemment and the economy. It is one of the most profitable components of
the aviation industry, and more efficient ground handling services could lead to increases in the
frequency of flights landing in Yemen's six airports, generating more revenue in the form of service fees.
Through competitive contracting, ground handling services could be provided in a more cost-effective,
timely manner that contributes to route profitability and the maintenance of airlines' service quality
profiles. This would increase labor productivity, raise enterprise efficiency and improve consumer
welfare. Improved ground handling facilities, by encouraging airlines to increase flight availability and
frequency, can also be an impetus for increased tourism.
Assuming flight frequency and seat availability increase by about 10 percent as a result of privatization, a
direct revenue increase estimated at about US$1 to 2 million per annum could potentially be realized.6
Available data is scarce. Staff estimates suggest the total subsidy could possibly reach about US $200 million equivalent
based on 1997 prices of oil. Some sources, however, suggest that the total subsidy may be less, possibly between US$40
million and US$100 million.
Ground handling charges currently total about US$15 million per annum. Landing and parking fees currently total about
US$3 million per annum.

Republic of Yemen                                                     Privatization Support Project
Should Sana'a become a regional transit hub for a foreign airline, a possibility given its attractive location
relative to African markets, traffic could increase by a further 20 percent, or about US$3 million.
Approximately 50 percent of this revenue increase could potentially accrue to the Government through
tax dividends and/or revenue shares, and provide an estimated fiscal benefit of approximately US$2
million per annum over the medium term. The direct fiscal benefits, however, are expected to be neutral
in the short-term, with any proceeds from the transaction being absorbed by redundant workers.
c)    General Land Transport Company
The General Land Transport Company (GLTC) has been plagued by economic losses for several years.
Privatization is expected to improve economic efficiency, and, in the long term, profitability, by way of
eliminating non-essential and non-operating assets. Competition in the market would come about through
unbundling and the privatization of services and route structures. Privatization is expected to encourage
new sector investment and revitalize the routes operated by the GLTC.
The expected fiscal benefits are modest. No immediate proceeds are anticipated after addressing labor
redundancy costs. In the longer-run, once the infrastructure is reestablished, a modest fiscal benefit
estimated at less than US$1 million per annum may be expected.
d)    Yemen Cement Company
The Yemen Corporation for Cement Production and Marketing (viz., Yemen Cement Company (YCC))
comprises three cement plants that currently supply about 50 percent of the domestic demand for cement.
According to unofficial estimates, an additional 30 percent of domestic demand is supplied by cement
imports, adding a considerable strain on Yemen's balance of payments. It is estimated that the remaining
20 percent of domestic demand is met by illegal imports.
The establishment of three separate cement companies through privatization is expected to encourage
competition, thereby increasing consumer welfare through the advent of more efficient market pricing.
Additionally, the product is expected to become lower cost and, through improved manufacturing
techniques, possibly more suited to local conditions and specifications in the construction sector. New
investment is expected to flow from privatization that should increase production and efficiency by way
of technological and operational improvements while also decreasing adverse environmental externalities.
New employment opportunities for Yemeni nationals should also arise as a result of increasing the
capacity of existing plants and building new plants.
Privatization of the YCC is expected to generate fiscal benefits in several ways. The country's balance of
payments position should improve with the expansion of local cement production, the lower costs
incurred by the construction sector, and the expected decrease in imports. The additional value added
promoted by the privatization is estimated at about US$50 million. Assuming a mix of sale of
government equity (25 percent) and the introduction of new investment (25 percent) by way of a
capitalization program and an enterprise value of not less than US$50 million, the proceeds from the sale
are estimated at about US$12 to 13 million.7 An estimated increase in annual production is expected to
generate an additional US$8 to 9 million per annum in taxes and dividends. The Government's removal
of fixed prices should also have a positive fiscal impact.
7Enterprise values can be estimated in the range of US$50 to $150 million depending on the assumptions made.

e)     Yemen Drug Company
The Yemen Drug Company (YDC) is a profitable enterprise with an existing private shareholding base of
25 percent. The company is currently profitable and is sizeable in the Yemeni context. The privatization
of YDC is expected to be integrated with the development of a rudimentary stock market for which it will
assist in setting disclosure standards, establishing procedures and identifying institutional needs.8
This transaction could lead to positive health externalities since a wider range of drugs may be made
available through local production and at lower costs. The removal of import and price controls should
pave the way for further competition which will benefit the consumer and result in a better quality
product.
The Government is expected to receive approximately US$7 to US$8 million in sales proceeds, and
incremental tax flows arising from improved profitability are estimated at about US$1 million over the
medium term.
The Counterfactual
The Aden Refinery, in the absence of privatization, would continue to represent a fiscal strain on the
economy. Moreover, its continued inefficient operation without the necessary investments poses serious
environmental and safety hazards, especially since the refinery's design is not best-suited to process local
hydrocarbons. Sub-optimal labor productivity would continue, constituting further strain on the
government in the form of wages.
In the aviation sector, if privatization of the various services is not introduced, Yemen will be
overlooking its potential to develop airports such as that of Sana'a into a regional hub. Ground handling
in particular, is a service that has a high profitability rate. Moreover, the provision of efficient and
prompt service in this sector provides airlines with a key incentive to increase the frequency of their
flights to and from Yemen, and this in turn provides Yemen with the ability to absorb this demand as a
result of a rapid aircraft turnaround rate. The opportunity cost of not implementing this strategy is very
high due to the large profit margin in the sector, and to the unrealized fiscal revenue in taxes and fee-
based services.
In the cement industry, if privatization and consequently competition are not introduced, adverse
practices such as monopoly-based, non-market prices will continue to prevail. Cement will continue to
be brought into the country illegally, robbing the country of revenue in value added. The illegal
importation of cement may also continue to have an adverse impact on the balance of payments. From a
consumer's point of view, local consumers such as construction companies and/or contractors would be
unable to increase their welfare with lower prices, and with products that meet local specifications more
closely.
The Yemen Drug Company, although already profitable, stands to gain much from further investments.
In the absence of privatization, these potential benefits would be substantially foregone. More drugs can
be manufactured, and at lower prices. Not only could this have a net positive economic impact in the
health sector, there is also potential for spill-over of expertise and technology in other manufacturing
sectors.
8 The Govemment has requested the Arab Monetary Fund, in coordination with the IFC, to formulate proposals for establishing
a simple stock market.

The continued operation of the GLTC in its present form would imply a continuation in economic loss
due to the operation and deterioration of assets. It would also make GLTC assets less attractive to
potential investors in the future.
Summary of Fiscal Impact
The table below illustrates the fiscal impact of the privatization. Currently, the large enterprises are a

Total Indicative Estimate:     20                  62                        7
The Net Present Value of the expected fiscal benefits is estimated to be approximately US$500 million,
assuming a discount rate of 10 percent. This estimate excludes the fiscal benefits expected to be
generated by the Project's transactions support for the privatization of small and medium enterprises.
Since the total project cost is estimated at US$16 million, the transaction cost of around 3 percent of total
benefits falls within an acceptable range of 1 to 10 percent, which is reasonable. Moreover, it can be
further hypothesized that, should the margin of error of the analysis be in the range of 50 percent, the
fiscal benefits and pay-back on the privatization transactions would still be substantial.
Factors Which May Influence Estimates
There are many factors that may affect the accuracy and reliability of estimates given above. Much of the
required data is outdated, inaccurate or not available. In the absence of concrete data, staff estimates
have been used, and are to be treated as rough indicators. Some benefits, such as those resulting from the
development of a stock market, and from positive health and environmental externalities, have not been
quantified. The estimates have also been based on assumptions related to the privatization strategies that
will be pursued, and these are subject to significant change as the privatization processes proceed.
Another important factor is the timing of benefits. While assumptions can be made about time-lines,
schedules are ultimately influenced by market conditions, as transactions may encounter obstacles. It
may become necessary in some instances to reject all bids, and make significant modifications before
starting a new bidding process.

Mr. James D. Wolfensohn
President
The World Bank
1818 H Street, N. W.
Washington, D.C. 20433
U.S.A
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn,
The Republic of Yemen has embarked on a comprehensive economic reform
program to develop a free and open economy, one in which private sector initiative
and competitive market forces are the engines of growth. In the reformed economy,
the. role of government in developing the productive sectors will concentrate on
establishing ancd managing a macroeconomic and regulatory environment that will
promote efficient private sector decisions in business investment and operations.
I want to reaffirm our pre-announced policy that it is the Government's
intention to withdraw, over the medium term, from competitive, commercial activities
and to seek private sector participation in utilities and other infiasructure services.
Privatization is seen by the Government as integral to the Government's
growth strategy ro attract greater extemal and domestic private investment, increase
the efficiency of enterprises, and improve the management and utilization of the
Government's limited budgetary and fiscal resources. We hope that our progress on
privatization will also signal to world markers and investors our comnitment to the
continued pursuit of economic reforms and to our objective of making the Republic of
Yemen a very attractive location in the Middle East for business investment and
operations.
The Government has already achieved significant progress in the past few
years through the privatization of several small enterprises, mainly in the tradable-
sector. We now want to accelerate and expand our privatzation efforts, for which we
have fornmlated the first phase of a Privatization Program covering the period from
1999 to 2002. This first phase comprises the privatization of about 70 small and
medium sized enrerprises and assets in the agriculture fisheries, industry, oil and gas,
trade and supply, and transport sectors, and also a significant number of large
enterprises and financial institutions.
To strengthen the environment for privatization. the Parliament has passed the
Privatization- Law which was promulgated under number 45 for the year 1999. Its
formulation  drew  heavily from  both imernational and  local experience with
privatization. The Law provides for

* A Cabinet-level High Committee for Privatization that has now been
formulated under my  Chaimanship to oversee the privatization
programs and approves transactions. This committee will be
appointed soon.
* The formal establishraent of the Technical Privatization Office (
TPO ),within the office of The Prime Minister to coordinate the
implementation of the program and act as secretariat to the High
Committee for Pnvatization.
*  The sector ministies to pla-y a hands-on role in the inplementation
of the transactions and to assume responsibility for results.
*  Clear rules, guidelines and processes for privatization requiring
trsparency in aHl transactions;
To build effective capacity within the TPO and the sector miaistries, key staff
are being recruited under open and transparent procedures and will be remunerated in
a manner as to atract the most qualified individuals. In addition, thie Government will
be especially vigilant in ensuring consistent- procedures. The High Committee for
Privatization will monitor all aspects of the program rigorously, and the TPO will be
required to fuilly disclose all aspects of the Privatization transactions.
The Government recognizes that there may be a large number of labor
redundancies incurred as the public enterprises are privatized. We have therefore
taken steps to create a uniformn and fair labor redundancy policy that should address
the concerns of the labor force, while also attracting investors and improving
confidence in Privatization program within both the investor community and the
public at large. We have established a Civil Service Fund (CSF) to manage redundant
civil service and. public enterprise labor, including transitional financial support and
separation incentives. We plan to develop a severance policy in the coming year and
seek support for its implementation from the international community.
The proposed Privatization Support Project, for which we have requested the
assistance of the Intemational Development Association, will be instrumental in.
helping my Government achieve the privatization targets under the first phase of our
Privatization Program. It will support the Government's eforts to build our internal
capacity to manage and carry out a demanding privatization program. It will also help
provide rhe substantial external and local technical expertise and financial advisory
services necessary for implementing the transactions. In the case of the large
enterprises, assistance will also be provided for implementing complementary
measures to address any constraints and impediments that may exist in their business
environments. The Government recognizes the necessity of recruiting the best
qualified consulting firms to ensure that these complex privatization transactions are
carried out successfully.
