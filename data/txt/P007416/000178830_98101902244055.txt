INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXCUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGSTON WATER COMMISSION WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF JAMAICA
FOR A SEWERAGE AND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to The Water Commission, Kingston, Jamaica (the Commission) with -the guarantee
of Jamaica, for the equivalent of US$15.0 million to help finance a sewerage
and water supply project. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including
four years of grace, with interest at 8 1/2% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        Economic Report (No. 257a-JM) entitled "Current Economic Position
and Prospects of Jamaica" was distributed to the Executive Directors on
March 12, 1974. An updating report will be prepared following an economic
mission to Jamaica planned for later this year. Country data sheets are
attached as Annex I to this report. A summary of the economic situation and
prospects appears below.
3.        During the decade 1962-72 the economy expanded rapidly with the annual
rate of growth accelerating from about 4.5% to about 5.5%. Population has been
increasing at a rate of about 1.6% per annum. At the same time the economy
experienced major structural changes. Mining, alumina production and tourism,
all supported by large private capital inflows, expanded, while agriculture
stagnated and agricultural exports, notably sugar, declined. This shift in
the production pattern was accompanied by rapid urbanization, persistent
unemployment and continuing disparities in income distribution. Large-scale
emigration during the decade resulted in the loss of significant numbers of
skilled and semi-skilled workers; the consequent shortage of technically
qualified personnel has been aggravated by the shortcomings of an academically
oriented education system.
4.        As a result of its limited resource endowment and the small size of
its domestic market, Jamaica has a very open economy heavily dependent on the
external sector. Until 1972, a widening current account deficit in the balance
of payments had been offset by substantial private capital inflows for expan-
sion of the bauxite/alumina industry. These inflows fell off sharply in 1972
with the completion of major investments in alumina capacity. Partly as a
consequence, but also due to speculative capital outflows, liberal domestic
credit policies and a rapid expansion in public expenditures, Jamaica for the
first time since independence experienced serious balance of payments
difficulties. Foreign exchange reserves fell sharply to a level at the end
of 1972 which would cover only two months' imports. Devaluation, the
imposition of import restrictions and tightening of credit policy in 1972
and 1973 were successful in temporarily reversing the reserves drain during
early 1973.



- 2 -
5.        During the second half of 1973 sharp increases in import prices
caused a fux-ther loss of reserves. This situation was aggravated by the
tripling of petroleum prices at the end of 1973 which cost Jamaica an extra
TJS$70 million in 1974, equivalent to about 8% of 1.974 export earnings.
6.        To conserve foreign exchange reserves, the government in early 1974
took a set of measures incl-tuding an increase in gasoline taxes, further
restrictions on imports andl credit availability and an increase in interest
rates. Jamaica also obtained increases in the prices of its sugar and banana
export-s to the United Kingdom. In May of 197L; the government announced
increases in taxes and royalties on the US and Canadian-owned bauxite companies,
wnhich yielded an ad;itional US$142 million in the financial year ending March 31,
1975. The greatly increased revenues in prospect from bauxite taxation are
expected to provide substanti:7l relief to Jamaica's balance of payments during
1975 and in ensuing years. The larger revenues should offset the higher cost
of oil and o-ther commodity imports and enable Jamaica during the next two to
three years to restore a re.^sonable level of foreign exchange reserves follow-
ing their depletion du.ring 1973 and early 197h.  However, continued improvement
in the external position will depend upon the government's ability to control
the growth in domestic incomes and prevent a substantial rise in imports of
consumer goods.
7.        The government's action to increase bauxite taxes and royalties
followed the failure to reach agreement with the companies on a renegotiatior.
of the tax clauses in the original company contracts. The companies objected
to the tax increase and three US-owned companies requested arbitration before
the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The
Convention creating the Centre establishes rules for the constitution of
tribunals, including rules for the appointment of arbitrators by the Chairman
of the Administrative Council of the Centre in case the parties fail to make
such appointments by mutual agreement. Acting under these rules, three
arbitral tribuxnals have been constituted and proceedings have commenced. The
points at issue (inclauding land ownership, governnent participation in the
coJmparnies and guaranteed supply of bauxite for the companies) are being dis-
cussed between the gov-ernment and the companies.  Agreement in principle has
recently been reached with tlfo of the companies on a number of these issues,
including the bauxite tax,,
8.        In 1973 there was a 19), increase in the! price level, which con-
trasted strongly with a long tradition of relative price stability,
and by April 1974 the consumer price index had increased by about
29% over April 1973; this was due partly to increases in world prices, the
effects of devaluation, and wage settlements in excess of productivity gains.
During the second half of 1974 the rate of inflation declined and by February
1975 the consumer price index stood at about 23% over February 1974. The
government has recently announced tha.t it intends to establish a Commission
for Economic Stabilization including representatives of government, the unions,
employers and other groups.  One of the purposes of the Commission would be to
enab.le the government bet-ter to understand and control inflation.  The government
has also stated that firms which grant wage increases beyond what is necessary to
sustain the level of real earnings plus productivity gains, will not be allowed
to pass the burden onto the consumer in terms of higher prices. The details of
the program have not. yet been announced but it could provide Jamaica with an
effective form of incomes policy and help maintain its international price
competitiveness.



- 3 -
9.        Without a sustained rate of economic growth of about 7% annually it
will be difficult for the country to achieve its principal objective of a
significant reduction in the high rate of unemployment, currently about 16% on
national average. The need for increased job creation will become even more
acute in the years ahead since the growth rate in the total population of
working age is expected to rise from 0.5% to 3% during the period 1970 to 1980
due to falling emigration and an increase in the birth rate in the 1950s. For
the immediate future the potential for increased growth and employment is
encouraging. In agriculture, a comprehensive review of the sector has recently
been undertaken with assistance from the Bank. Government initiatives are
already under way to rehabilitate the important sugar industry; other government
schemes to revitalize the sector include land-use reorganization to increase
productivity and employment, and measures to stimulate other export crops and
domestic food production. In the mining sector, substantial increases in bauxite
and alumina output are expected as a result of recent investments, and further
investments in alumina processing will soon be initiated in joint ventures to
supply proposed aluminum smelters in Mexico and Trinidad.    A substantial invest-
ment in an oil refinery is in prospect with the possibility of associated
investments in petro-chemicals; and in manufacturing, there is potential for
increased contribution to export growth.   Further growth in tourism (the country's
second largest foreign exchange earner) may also be expected, provided that there
is a resumption of a reasonable rate of growth in North America.
10.       The extent to which Jamaica's agricultural and industrial
growth potential can be realized will depend in large part on how successful the
government is in channelling into most productive uses the substantially increased
revenues resulting from the bauxite production levy and recent higher sugar sales
proceeds. Jamaica has the opportunity to mobilize these fiscal resources for
use in productive capital investments and make a lasting contribution towards
solving the unemployment problem; but it will be necessary to restrain the
growth of government current expenditure and accelerate the rate at which public
sector investment projects can be initiated and completed. During both the 1974/5
and 1975/6 fiscal years, the greater part of the additional bauxite revenues will
be used to help finance a sharp increase in central government expenditures, much
of it for consumptive purposes; despite these extra revenues the overall
budgetary deficit will continue to widen. A large proportion of these expendi-
tures will benefit the unemployed and low income groups. Nevertheless, for last-
ing benefits in the long run the govemrment has to sustain an investment program
of considerable magnitude and substantial internal financing will be needed
over the next few years; this will entail stricter control over recurrent
expenditures so that the financial resources for productive investment will be
available when required.
11.       The increased rate of growth necessary to make a significant impact on
unemployment will require substantially higher levels of external capital inflows
than have occurred in the recent past. Such inflows are in prospect over the next
few years and given continued progress in public policies, it is likely that
they could be maintained for the rest of the decade. The source and direction
of commitments of external public loans (including government-guaranteed loans)



from 1965 to 1974 which have averaged some $70 million per annum, are given in
i:he Lable in Annex 1. For the five-year period 1974-78, net public capital
inflows, including guaranteed loans to the private sector, should average
nearly U$1h0 million a year.   From existing indications, about 30% will be
raised from official sources--the Bank, IDB and bilateral aid sources--while
the remainder would consist of medium-term loans from suppliers and financial
institutions for a number of large-scale public projec-ts in alumina anu petro-
leum refining. These larger external.. capital resources will have to be
stupplemented by increasing dom.estic financial resources, both private anid public.
It will thus be necessary for the government, as stated above, to take measutres
-to restrain the growth of government current expendituires and to achieve a growth
of revenue relative to GDP.  A recovery in private sector savinm   can be expected
only if the government maintains fiscal discipline and discourages excessive
consuaption by the appropriate use of fiscal and monetary policy.
12.       External public debt, service as a ratio of export earnings rose from
less than 5% in 1973 to nearly 7% in 1974. It is projected to reach a peak
o, 8.5% in 1978 and then to decline steadily to about 4% by 1985. These debt
service ratios are low, in part reflecting the high ratio (40%) of exports to
GDP. Although debt service has recently increased substantialiyl, largely on
account of Euro-dollar borrowings in 1973/74, Jamaica. is creditworthy for
additional external borrowing on appropriate terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS TN JAMhICA
Introduction
13.       Since the country's independence in 1962, the Bank has made twelve
loans to Jamaica totalling over $115 million. Of this amount just over one
half has been for infrastructural investments in electric power, water supply
and transport; the remainder has gone into education , agricultural credit,
family planning and a sites and services project. The proposed loan would be
the second for watex supply and the first with a sewerage component.  There have
so far been only two IFC operations; a loan in 1961 to a pre-mix concrete
company, and an equity/loan investment in 1968 in a hotel project. Annex 2
contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of April 30.
1975, together with notes on the execution of ongoing projects.  As no-ted in
Annex II, the Bank has experienced difficulties in the execution of a number
of its projects in Jamaica, although recently some improvement has taken place.
Future Direction of Bank Lending
14.       Bank lending to Jamaica will help to maintain an adequate flow of
long-term external capital to the country anj is aimed at supporting appropriate
policies in critical areas of the economy mentioned in Part I of this report.
The Bank program has been developed taking -Into account the role of other externial
lending agencies--IDB, CIDA, ODM, AID and the Caribbean Development Bank--and is
designed to assist programs conducive to increased employment and wider



-5 -
distribution of the benefits of growth, to strengthen the balance of payments,
and to improve the couitry's essential infrastructure. It is also an important
objective of Bank lending to strengthen the public sector institutions by
supporting policies to improve their quality of management and internal pro-
cedures and, in the case of public utilities, to promote appropriate pricing
policies to ensure their financial viability.
15.       After a lull in Bank lending in 1972/73--due largely to institutional
constraints and slow project preparation--the pace of Bank operations has re-
cently accelerated. The Bank's share of external public debt outstanding and
disbursed is projected to increase gradually from about 9% in 1974 to about
15% in 1980, and its share of external public debt service to increase from 7%
to 7.2% over the same period.
16.       In infrastructure, the Bank is considering the possibility of a second
power loan to help finance the transmission and distribution requirements of the
government-owned electricity company: the project would also aim at improving
the company's finances, management and technical openations. The Bank also
expects to continue to provide assistance for high priority investments in the
transport sector which were identified by a national transport survey conducted
in 1968/70.
17.       Improvements in social infrastructure are urgently required to meet
the essential requirements of the rapidly expanding Kingston Metropolitan Area
(KNA), which accounts for over one-quarter (about 670,000) of the total popu-
lation of Jamaica and a large proportion of its industry and commerce. The
project now before you would provide (i) extension of Kingston's sewerage
system in high priority areas (80% of the city population is not served) and
check the growing hazard to health arising from sewage overflows and pollution
of ground water sources; (ii) limited additional water supplies to avoid
shortages over the next four to five years until the next water supply source
can be developed; and (iii) for strengthening of the finances and operations
of the Borrower, the Kingston Water Commission. Looking ahead, it is expected
that the government would wish the Bank to finance further improvements to
the city's water and sewerage facilities. The Bank also expects to continue its
association with the government in expanding the supply of low1-cost self-help
housing in Kingston through further stages of the sites and services program
for which a first Bank loan was made during 197h. The first sites and services
project includes an urban growth and management study for the Kingston area
which will provide the framework for future urban planning and investment in
the region.
18.       Also in the social sector, the Bank is assisting the government in the
preparation of a second population project. This may include the building and
equipping of rural health centers and of midwifery training schools and a
nutrition component for the processing and distribution of infant weaning food.
We also plan further lending in the education sector; the content of a possible
project will be determined when further progress has been made in formulating
the government's development plans for the education sector and in implementing
the second Bank-financed project (Loan No. 727-JM).



- 6 -
19.       In the directly productive sectors, the Bank is already involved
in agriculture through two 1loans to the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB) for
on-lending for agricult,ural credits. The Bank has assisted in the conduct
of an agricultural sector survey aimed at revitalizing the sector as a means
of promoting exports, stimnulat-ing import substitution, raising incomes in the
rural a-eas and checking -the population drift into  the urban areas. W-e expect
to assist the government in implementing the program of action which is emerging
from the sector study, and will be placing increasing emphasis on agriculture
in our future lending to Jarxaica. Preparation is nearing completion of a
project to rehabilitate the important sugar industry, increase the productivity
of cane famners, and strengthen the operations and imnagement of the goverment-
o-wned sugar estates. The Bank, through the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program is
also assisting the government in the preparation of a rural development pro-
ject desi gned to improve the livelihood of smal1 farmers: the scope and con-
tent of the project has not yet been finalized but may include land consolidation,
development and settlement, cormlementary  measures to increase agricultural
production, and improvements in social infrastructure.
PART III - THE SANITATION SECTOR IN JAMAICA
20.       Out of a total population of about 2.0 mdllion, it is estimated that
over 90% of the urban population and about 40% of the rural population are
served with piped water, althlough during the past five years shortages of water
have developed in the Kingston area during the dry season. Sewerage is very
limited in Jamaica and for the most part use is made of soakage pits, septic
tanlcs and pit privies.  In the rural areas sewer systems are practically non-
existent, whilst in the urban areas only Kingston and Montego Bay have partial
systems.  Even in Elngston only about 20% of the population is served, and in
so e areas sewage overflowqs onto the surface of the ground and is contaminating
the grcund-at1er.
21.      'fhe principal agencies responsible for the provision of water supply
an(i sewerage services in Jamiaica are the Wlater Commission, (the Conrission)
whcoh covers -t.he Kin,gstc.n co-norate area, and the National Water Authority (NITA)
which acts in the rest o` the country:  these two statutory bodies report to the
Yinistry of Public Utiiities,, Communications and Transport.  Outside the
Kinf.s3t.on area, the NT;A sells water in bulk to the local Parish Councils, which
are vesponsible f.for retai distriEition go consumers.  Inside the Kingston
Corpora .e area the Comiission is wholly responsible for all stages of water
supply and is also responsible for sewerage services.  The present division
of responsibility in the sanitat,ion sector is not entirely satisfactory and
tle government has for some time been considering various proposals for re-
organizing the institutional framework in the sector to provide a mwre rational
basis for water resource development, allocation, and administration and
provision of water supply and sewerage facilities. However, the various
alternatives need fwrther study before final decisions can be taken. The govern-
ment has agreed that within 2 1/2 years of loan signing, it will, in con-
sultation with the Bank, complete its review of, and thereafter define, the
organization and allocation of responsibilities of the public agencies within
the water and sewerage sector   (Section 3.03 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).



- 7 -
22.       The NWA and the Comnmission are planning substantial water supply and
sewerage investments over the next five years. The IDB is providing financial
and technical support to the NWA to improve water and sewerage services out-
side Kingston, whilst the Bank has been associated with the Commission since
the first water supply loan of US$5 million of May 1, 1969 (Ln. 598-JM).   This
loan helped to finance water supply and distribution facilities in the Kingston
area which have now been virtually completed. Its execution has taken con-
siderably longer than anticipated due to delays in the award of contracts, con-
struction difficulties, labor problems and long delivery times for equipment.
Progress has been made under the project in improving the organization and
management of the Commission. The Commission has appointed a Financial Con-
troller;  it has established a public utility accrual accounting system,
employed qualified independent auditors to audit its accounts, improved its
water tariff structure, extended water metering from 88% to 93% of its
customers, obtained the right to collect sewerage taxes directly, began re-
ducing excess personnel and decentralizing operations, and completed a
sewerage master plan for Kingston. The Commission, however, was not able
to achieve the 8% rate of return on net water supply assets as required in
the Bank's loan agreement, principally on account of rapidly escalating operating
costs and delay by the government in agreeing to overdue water rate increases.
Also, the Cormnission continued to incur deficits on its sewerage operations
which have been financed by subsidies from the government. The Commission's
financial outlook has improved considerably folloring the implementation of a
substantial water rate increase in Decemrber 1974 (estimated to increase water
revenues by 60%) and the recently approved 50% increase in sewerage revenues.
There remains a considerable need to strengthen the Commission's senior and
middle management, to institute a proper training program, and further improve
financial, administrative and operating procedures. The proposed project in-
cludes arrangements specifically designed to meet these aims and, in particular,
to permit the Commission to meet the revised financial objectives incorporated
in the proposed loan agreement for this project (ref. paragraphs 36 to 38 below).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
23.        The proposed project was identified and prepared by the Water Commission
with the help of consultants and Bank staff. The project was appraised in January
1974 and during a follow-up visit in July 1974. After progress in implementing
institutional and financial improvements associated with the project (see para-
graphs 36 and 37 below), negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington
in April/May 1975. The Borrower's delegation was led by Mr. S.W. Parke, Secretary/
Manager, and the government delegation by Mr. F.A.R. Mullings, Deputy Financial
Secretary. A report entitled "Jamaica--Appraisal of Kingston Sewerage and Water
Supply Project" (No. 615a-JM, June 11, 1975) is being distributed separately to
the Executive Directors. The main features of the loan and the project are
summarized in Annex III of this report.
Project Objectives
24.        The primary objectives of the project are:   to develop additional sources
of water to overcome seasonal shortages in the Kingston area; to undertake a
comparative study of various possible water supply sources in the Kingston area
to determine which should be developed next; to prepare a plan for the allocation



of wat,:-jr resources in the Linstead Basin and Kingston and Spanish town areas;
to bFgin the first phase of a long-term program provid:lng sewerage services to
tlhe Kingston area thereby protecting groundwa-ter sources and reducing pollutiion
-nd hazards to health;  and to improve the finarcial, administrative and
technical operations of the Commission.
?roject Description
2$.       The principal components of the project comprise:   (i) construction
of water supply and sewerage facilities in the Kingston area, including en.,4reering
and design studies;  (ii) studies relating to a next phase water resources de-
-relopment, allocation and stora e; and (iii) technical assistanJce to strengthen
the Commission.
(i)  Constnrction of Water and Sewerage Faciiities
26.       Water - During the sumrer months the flow from surface water sources
to Kingston diminishes considerably;  in 1973 the prolonged drought required
rationing of water supplies. During 1974, although the Rio Cobre scheme (which
-the Bank helped to finance under its first loan) came into partial operat-ion,
rationing and restrictions were necessary during periods of peak demandi. The
present project provides for the construction of a new well-field near the
Tulloch Pumping Station (about 20 miles northwest of Kingston) estimated to
yield an average of about 6 mgd 1/ which would be pun.ed into a nel i  peir;e
leading to the Tulloch Pumping Station and thence to Kingston through the
existing mains. The extraction of water from the aquifer will reduce the flow
in the Rio Cobre River during the dry season.   Since it is necessary to maintain
this river's flow at near its cpresent level for irrigatior purposes down-stream,
a second well-field w.iould be developed in the Rio Magno Valley, north 0of uhe
Tulloch Pumping Station, also with an estimated yield of about 6 mgd. to pro-
vide "compensation" water as needed which would be pumped through a new pipeline,
emptying into the .Rio Cobre River.  A third group of wells, estimated to yield
an average of 4 mngd, would be drilled in the Liguanea Plains within the metro-
politan area of Kirgston, and would be pumped directly into adjacent mains and
distribution network.  The CommTission has aiready begun drilling a number of
these wells to ease the shorteLges which are likely to occur during t.he 1575 dry
season.  Intake works, a pumping station and pipeline would be constructed at
Hall's Green, north of the metropolitan area, which would supply an extra 1 mgd.
Other related water works include a filter plant, a leak detection survey and
replacement of defective mains, master meter installation, the establishment
of pressure zones and a transfer main and pumping station.
27.       Sewerage - A master sewerage plan for the Kingston area was prepared
by consultants in July 1973.  The sewerage component of the proposed project
comprises two high priority items selected from the plan. The first, the Lower
Western Sewer District, covers low-income areas with inadequate sewage disposal
where there is danger from sewage contaminating the grourd water supply.   The
second, the Upper Central Sewer District, covers an area at present subject to
a building moratorium on account of the lack of sewerage facilities.   Street
sewers, laterals, trunk mains and pumping stations would be constructed in the
highest population density sections of these two districts to collect and con-
vey sewage to the Greenwich Treatment Plant. Existlng legislation empowers the
Commission to require property owners to connect to sewer lines which pass
1/ million gallons per day.



- 9 -
within 100 yards of a property but this power has not been frequently used.
The Commission has agreed to take steps to ensure that sewerage connections
are made to all properties falling aithin the project areas, and that all
necessary internal plumbing and water closet installation will be unde-rtaken.
The Commission has also agreed to submit to the Bank for its approval within
nine months of the date of the Loan Agreement a program to provide technical
and financial assistance to low income owners and occuniers unable to meet the
cost of such sewer connections (Section 6.o0 of the draft Loan Agreement).
(ii) Studies
28.       Water Resources Desk Study - In recent Donths various schemes have
been under consideration for development of the next source of water supply for
the Kingston area. These schemes include the north and south Blue Mountain
schemes, the Linstead Basin scheme and the Wag Water scheme.  The project would
include a water resources desk study to evaluate these schemes and to recommend
the next water supply scheme which should be developed.  The Water Conmission
may, in due course, request Bank assistance for financing the next water supply7
scheme;  in the meantime, it has agreed not to undertake during the period of
project execution any investment, other than those provided for in the project,
exceeding US$0.5 million in any financial year (Section 5.05(b) of the draft
Loan Agreement). There is growing competition for the water of the Linstead
Basin for irrigation needs in St. Catherine's Plain, and for industrial,
commercial and residential requirements in the fast-expanding development along
the Kingston and Spanish Town metropolitan axis. The water resources study
would examine the feasibility of developing the Linstead Basin and include re-
commendations and a plan for the integrated development and allocation of water
resources (including treated sewage effluent)within the region.
29.       Hermitage Dam - The major reservoir for the Kingston water system is
the Hermitage Dam which was built in 1927. Its present structural stability
needs examination and the project would make provision for this purpose.
30.       Water and Sewer Connection Survey - The Conmissionls records indicate
an average of 10 people per water connection. This high figure is probably the
result of improperly classified, and possibly clandestine, connections which
could represent a significant loss in revenue. The Commission has agreed that,
within one year of loan signing, it will complete a survey and update its
records of the number and size of its water and sewer connections (Section 6.03
of the draft Loan Agreement).
(iii) Technical Assistance
31.       Consultants would provide management advisory services for the re-
organization and strengthening of the Commission, including the implementation
of a training program for administrative staff and for technical staff operating
the Coriussionts plant and facilities (see paragraph 36 below).
Project Execution
32.       The project would be executed over a four year period by the Conmission
with the help of consultants. Project design, supervision of construction,
studies and technical assistance to be financed out of the proceeds of the loan



_ 10 -
would be carried out by consultants acceptable to t'he Bank under terms of
reference approved by the Bank. The appointment by the Commission of a full-
time qualified P-roject Ianager, with adequate supporting staff, to be responsible
for project execution would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan (Section
9.01 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Cost Estimates
33.       The cost of the project (excluding interest during construction) is
estimated at US$30.0 million including contingencies but excluding duties and
taxes. The proposed US$15.C0 million Bank loan would finance the foreign
exchange costs estimated at US$12.5 million (42%) and US$2.5 million of interest
cn the Bank loan during constjruction.   Local costs of the project estimated at
US$17.4 million would be financed by a government loan of US$6.0 million for
25 years including four years of grace at 8% and a contribution of US$11.4
million irom the Commission (US$8.0 million from internally generated revenues
and US$3.4 million from government subsidies for sewerage operating deficits)
(see paragraph 37 below).
Procurement
34.       Pipes and accessories, pumps and related equipment (estimated to
cost about US$8.5 million in total) would be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement".
Local manufacturers will be accorded a margin of preference of 15% of the cif
price or the actual tariff, whichever is lower.   For civil works (excluding
drilling and equipping of wells) contracts (estimated to cost about US$18.1
million in total) would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally and in accordanice with local procedures satisfactory to the Bank. The
type and size of the civil works are such that overseas firms are unlikely to
be interested in bidding. Because of the specialized nature and limited amount
of thle work involved, the drilling and equipping of wells (estimated to cost
US$0.5 million) is not suitable for local or international competitive bidding;
seParate contracts would theref'ore be negotiated directly with qualified local
contractors so that work in the three well fields can be carried out simul-
taneously.
Disbursement
35.       Disbursenent of the Bank loan would extend over about four years and
would be m de on the basis of 1000% of foreign expenditures on imported equipment
and materials, on consultants' services and on interest on the Bank loan, and
15. (representing the estimated foreign exchange component) of expenditures on
civil works.  Estimateci annual disbursements of the loan are given in Annex III
of this report. Subject to Bank approval, any saving on the Bank loan would be
used for extensions to the sewer system in accordance with the master plan, for
water meters and accessories.   In order to avoid acute shortages of water
dur½n- the 1975 dry season, the Commission has begun construction of the wells
and has also engaged consultants for part of the technical assistance program
under thle project. It is, therefore, recommended that foreign expenditures on
well construction and on consulting services incurred after December 1, 1974 and
before loan signing, no-t exceeding US$300,000 in the aggregate, be financed
retroactively from the proceeds of the loan.



The Bor-roer
36.       The Coimiission is a wholly-owned government corporation established
under statute in 1937. It is managed by a board of nine members, headed by a
Chairman, all of whom are appointed by the goveTnment. The Commission's organi-
zational structure and its accomodation arrangements need to be improved; the
Commission has agreed that within six months of signing the loan agreement it
will prepare a program satisfactory to the Bank for reorganizing its administrative,
technical and financial departments and for improving its office accomodation
(Section 6.01 of the draft loan Agreement). Consultants have been engaged by
the Commission to assist in implementing the proposed reorganization.   In
recent years, the Conmissionts operations have increased sharply and it is now
planning major investments in water and sewerage facilities. To handle this
additional workload more effectively, the Conmission proposes to split the
functions of Secretary/Aanager, previously combined in one post, and intends
shortly to appoint a General Manager with overall responsibility for the lWater
Cormnission's operations. The appointment of a qualified person designated
to take up duties as General Manager within six months of his appointment,
would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan (Section 9.01 of the draft
Loan Agreement). The Commission is recru-iting staff for a number of vacant
mriddle level management (technical and managerial) positions. At the lower
levels, there is over-staffing, inefficiencl- and excessive overtime which has
been one of the main causes of escalating operating costs. The Commission has
already initiated a program to reduce operating costs, including staff re-
ductions, and decentralization of operations so as to simplify personnel control.
As part of this program the Commission proposes to reduce its annual operating
wage costs as a proportion of its total operating costs from its present level
of about 62% to a level not exceeding 53% by the financial year 1977 and there-
after not exceed this level. The Commission will also make training arrangements
satisfactory to che Bank for its technical, administrative and operating per-
sonnel within six months of loan signing (Section 6.02 (a) of the draft Loan
Agreement).
Financial Evaluation
37.       Until recently, the Commission's financial situation had been deteriora-
ting due to rapidly escalating operating costs and delay by the government in
approving the implementation of water and sewerage tariff increases. As a con-
sequence the Commission fell substantially short of achieving the 8% rate of
return on net water supply assets stipulated in the Bank's existing loan agree -
ment for the first water supply project (Loan No. 598-JM) and ran a substantial
deficit on its sewerage operations which the government subsidized, as it was req-
uired to do under the guarantee agreement. After considerable exhortation by the
Bank, action has recently been initiated which should soon lead to a marked improve-
ment in the Commission's fiscal performance. A water rate increase of 60% was
introduced in December 1974 and the government has recently approved the implemen-
tation of a 53% increase in sewerage charges to take effect on July 1, 1975 (para-
graph 22). The revised level of sewerage charges will not altogether eliminate
the deficit on the Commission's sewerage operations. Nevertheless, the Commission's
combined water and sewerage revenues will enable it to achieve a satisfactory finan-
cial rate of return on its consolidated water supply and sewerage assets (see follow-
ing paragraph); thus, after the end of the current financial year ending March 31,



_ 12 -
1976, any future deficits on sewerage operations will be financed from
water revenues and not, as hitherto, from government subsidies. The govern-
.1 will finance the expected deficit on sewerage operations arising during
the current financial year and, as a condition of loan effectiveness, will pay
the Commission the necessary grant funds to finance the sewlrage operating
deficits incurred up to the end of the 1975 financial year... Also, in order
to re-establish the Commission's financial structure on a sounder financial
basis the government will, as a condition of loan effectiveness, provide to
the Bank, and thereafter promptly implement, a plan for capitalizing or writing
off (a) overdue maturities of loans from the government to the Commission as of
MYrch 31, 1975 and (b) up to 50% of outstanding debt at that date from the
Commission to the government. This should enable the Water Commission to
maintain a satisfactory debt/equity ratio of about 20/80 appropriate to a
public utility of this kind (Sections 2.02, 2.04 and 2.05 of the draft Guarantee
Agreement, and Section 9.01 of the draft Loan Agreement).
38.      In addition to the recent rate increases, the Commission is taking
other steps to augment its revenues. -By March 31, 1977 it will reduce its
accounts receivable on billing balance to a maximum of 2 1/2 months (accounts
receivable have been up to four months in arrears) and, within six months of
signing of the Loan Agreement, it will establish and thereafter maintain, an
efficient system for discontinuing service to customers whose accounts are in
arrears. It will also improve its procedures for billing and collection of
amounts due from customers and take appropriate measures to eliminate un-
authorized connections (Section 6.02 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement).   Further-
more, the new water tariff already provides substantial penalties for late
payment and reconnection charges after service has been shut off. The proposed
connection survey (paragraph 30 above) should also enable the Commission to
capture additional revenues. These measures, coupled with implementation of
the proposed cost reduction program (paragraph 36 above), should lead to a
significant improvement in the Commission's financial performance in both water
and sewerage operations. The Commission has agreed to take all necessary action,
including cost savings and maintenance and adjustment of rates and charges for
its water supply and sewerage services, to produce an annual rate of return in
real terms (i.e. calculated on the basis of asset values corrected for inflation)
of 1% in the financial year 1976, 2% in the financial years 1977 and 1978, 3%
in the financial year 1979 and 4% in the financial year 1980 (when the project
will have been completed), and thereafter (Section 5.04 of the draft Loan Agreement
Prior to the start of any financial year and at quarterly intervals thereafter,
the Commission will provide to and consult with the Bank on (i) forecasts of the
rate of return in real terms it will achieve during that financial year, together
with supporting data including its estimate of the increase in prices during
that year, and (ii) a statement of action which will be taken by the Commission
to ensure that the rate of return in real terms specified in the Loan Agreement
will be achieved in the financial year in question. The government has also
agreed to take such action as may be necessary to enable the Commission to
ieet its rate of return obligations (Section 3.02 of the draft Guarantee Agreement,.

duction of a rate system which will provide for regular periodic adjustments
of its rates. The Commission will continue to have its accounts audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
Project Justification and Economic Evaluation
39.       The population growth in the Kingston area is about 3.1% per annum--
about twice the national average and total water demand is estimated to in-
crease at 2% per year. The project would provide additional capacity for a
net increase in water supply to Kingston of about 11 mgd to meet existing
shortages and avoid rationing duringthe dry season and satisfy the expected
increment in demand during the period to 19,80 when the next water supply source
for Kingston is scheduled to come into operation.  The present sewerage system
serves about a fifth of the population and the lack of a central sewerage system
is posing an increasing threat to water wells in the area which produce approxi-
mately 19% of the city's supply. This factor combined with high population
density imposes a serious health hazard .due to current sewage seepage and over-
flows from septic tanks.  The lack of a central sewerage system is also holding
up construction of accommodation in the upper central area. The project pro-
vides for extending the sewer system to cover the most densely populated parts
of two sewer districts to serve a population of about 100,000. Feasibility
studies for the project were based on the Kingston Town Planning Department
Zoning Map which reflects recommendations of the 1971 Kingston Regional Plan.
The proposed project is the least cost solution designed to resolve the problems
described above. The project will also help the government to determine the
allocation of water resources in the Linstead Basin and in the Kingston/Spanish
Town area where there is growing competition for water for agricultural, in-
dustrial and domestic use. The inclusion of a water resources comparative study
will help the Commission determine which, from among a nunber of possible
schemes, it would be most appropriate to develop next.
40.       The following benefits of the project were estimated:   the incre-
mental sale of water and the incremental revenues from the new sewerage
services (both valued on the basis of the recently revised tariffs), and part
of the increase in land values resulting from the project in the areas to be prov-
ided with sewers. Only 40% of the predicted land value increase was used since,
although the lifting of the building moratorium is a direct result of the avail-
ability of sewers, other infrastructure contributes towards the increase in
land values and the respective benefits cannot be computed accurately.
On this basis the rate of return is about 11%.   However, these calcu-
lations exclude the social benefits from the reduction in stream and harbor
pollution, the reduction in hazard to health, and the employment
of 300 to 400 workers during project construction.  The progressive structure
of the recently revised water tariff will greatly favor lower income groups (the
unit charge for the lowest level of consumption will now equal one fifth the
charge for the highest compared with one-third previously); also the government
will recapture a substantial part of the increase in land values through its
property taxes.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Commission, the
draft Guaarantee Agreement between Jamaica and the Bank, the Report of the
CoRmittee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreemriet and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.   Special
features of the project are highlighted in paragraphs 36, 37 and 38 of this
report.  As additional conditions of loan effectiveness, the government will
pay to the Commission funds to meet its sewerage operating deficits up to
`%rch 31, 1975 and will provide the Bank with a plan for capitalizing or
writing off part of the Conirrission's outstanding debt to the government: and
the Commission will appoint a Provect Marager and a General ianager designate
(paragraphs 32, 36 and 37).
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed lom would comply with the Articles
of Agreemnent of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOM1ENDATION
43.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. Projects in Execution
Ln. No. 727   Second Education Project;   US$13.5 million of March 25, 1971
Closing Date: Decemrber 31, 1975.
Managerial weaknesses in both the Education Ministry and the
project unit have caused delays in the implementation of the project; iinple-
mentation is over two years behind appraisal schedule. It is expected that
all the project items will be completed by December 1976.   A postponement of
the closing date by a year and a half is likely to be required. Because of
the late implementation, devaluation of the Jamaican dollar and inflation
a cost overrun of about 40% is likely. The government has recently transferred
responsibility for execution of the construction aspects of the project to a
newly established government owned National Development Agency since ashen
progress in project implementation has improved. The government has also
recently appointed a Project Mianager in the Ministry of Education wiho will be
responsible for supervision and coordination of all aspects of project imple-
mentation.
Ln. No. 719   Azricultural Credit Pro;ect-   US$3.7 million of December 28, 1970
Closing Date   une 30, 197
After a slow start the project has picked up momentum and the
Bank loan is now fully committed with almost 80% of loan funds disbursed.
Disbursements, which lagged initially, due to delays in land titling and cumber-
some loan processing procedures, are now proceeding at a satisfactory rate.
The Bank has agreed to two reallocations of the loan proceeds to increase credit
availability for beef and dairy production.    The loan closing date, originally
December 31, 1974, has been extended to June 30, 1976..
Ln. No. 690   Population Project; US$2.0 million of June 18, 1970
Closing Date: March 31 1977~
There have been delays in the design/construction programs for the
Victoria Jubilee Hospital (VJH) and ten rural maternity centers (RMCs), due
primarily to problems of coordination and management. However, more recently
improved progress has been made in implementing some of the principal aspects of
the program. Constructicn of all ten RMCs has been physically completed, although
one is not yet in operation due to staffing problems. Construction of the VJH
expansion is under way although there have been delays largely due to unsatisfactory
performance by the main contractor; the sureties are now providing site supervision.
The loan closing date, originally March 31, 1975, has been postponed to March 31,
1977. Progress has been slow in implementing the training and home encouragement
aspects of the family planning program, but intensified efforts are being made in
these areas through the use of community health aides. The family planning services
have been integrated into the Ministry of Health.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the progress
of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems which are
being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They should be
read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not purport to present
a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

In. 7j._98    Kingston Water Supply Project; US$5.0 million of May 14, 1969
Closing Date: August 31, 1975
After initial delays over the acquisition of land rights and in the
award of contracts, implementation of the physical aspects of the project has
improved and the works are now partially in operation. Full service should be in
operation by August 1975.  The loan closing date, originally June 30, 1972, has
been postponed to August 31, 1975. After a period of weak financial performance
during which the Water Commission was not able to obtain the 8% rate of return
required in the Loan Agreement, the situation has improved following a 60%
average increase in water rates in December 1974. The Commission is also taking
measures to strengthen its management, operating procedures and to reduce costs.
Ln. No. 899   Road Improvement and Maintenance Project; US$9.3 million of June 1, 1973
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
After some initial delays-and quality control problems, the resealing
program is progressing satisfactorily. Resealing of 40 miles of road on force
account has been completed; Phase I of resealing on corntract is 2(0 completed and
Phase II of resealing on contract has been started. Contracts for resurfacing
200 miles of arterial road have been awarded and work has commenced. Total project
costs are now estimated at about 50% above the appraisal estimate due to increased
costs of asphaltic over]ay; nevertheless, the project is estimated to have a rate
of return of about 30%.
Ln. No. 1003  Sites and Services Project; US$15.0 million of June 13, 1974
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Construction of the infrastructure and core units at Spanish Town,
Camplands and Marcus Garvey is proceeding satisfactorily and infrastructure
construction at Cockburn Pen (squatter upgrading area) has commenced. Contract
documents for community facilities are near completion. The contract for the
infrastructure and core units at Hunts Bay will be awarded shortly. Draft terms
of reference have been prepared for the Urban Growth and Management Study; after
some initial delay, consultants will shortly be appointed for the diagnos'tic
study of the Ministry of Housing.
Ln. No. 1004  Second Agricultural Credit Project; US$5.5 million of June 13, 1974
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
This loan became effective on September 19, 1974 and is progressing
satisfactorily. Subloan approvals are ahead of the appraisal schedule while
subloan commitments are running close to appraisal estimates.
In. No. 1032  Third Highway Project; US$13.5 million of July 26, 1974
Glosing Date: December 31, 1977
Work has commenced on the Bog Walk to Linstead arterial road section,
which is being undertaken on force account. Bid prices for the two May Pen bypass
sections were up to 47% higher than appraisal estimates and negotiations are taking
place with the lowest bidder to try to reduce costs. No acceptable bids were
received for the Williamsfield to Greenvale arterial section and the government is
now considering what course of action to take and will consult with the Bank. Even
with these increased costs the project is still economically feasible,producing
rates of return between 12% and 17% for individual road sections.

Ln. 1io. 10h3  Airot Developr.ent Project; IJS$12.5 million of October 2, 1974
Closing Date: June 30 1977
This loan became effective on March 1h, 1975. Delays were
incurred in appointing the engineering consultants and establishing the project
team and therefore in get-ting the initial design and procurement work underway.
However, design and planning for project execution is now progressing and
one contract for improving the arrivals area at Norman Manley Airport has been
awarded.  The Airports Authority of Jamaica (AAJ) is now well established and
the organisational work largely complete. Management consultants are assisting
the AAJ in preparing training programs and management and information systems.
Consultants have been appointed to assist the Civil Aviation Department in
improving its organisation and management techniques.

Financing Plan:           The Bank loan of US$15.0 million equivalent would fully
cover the estimated foreign exchange cost (US$12.5 million)
of the project plus interest on the Bank loan during
construction estimated at US$2.5 million. Local costs of
the project estimated at US$17.4 million would be financed
by a government loan of US$6.0 million and a contribution
of US$11.4 million from the Commission's internally
generated revenues and government subventions for
sewerage operating deficits.

Arrangements:             Procurement of pipe and accessories, pumps and related electric
equipment would be by international competitive bidding.
Local manufacturers would be accorded a margin of preference
15% of the c.i.f. price or the actual tariff, whichever
is lower. Civil works contracts (excluding the drilling
and equipping of wells) would be awarded on the basis of
competitive bidding advertized locally and in accordance
with the Borrower's usual procurement procedures; for the
drilling and equipping of wells, contracts would be
negotiated with local contractors. In order to accelerate
the execution of the project, retroactive financing up to
US$0.3 million would be allowed for well-drilling and
consultancy services.
Technical Assistance:     Project design and supervision, feasibility and engineering
studies, and management advisory services for the Commission,
would be carried out by qualified consultants acceptable to
the Bank. Consulting firms for the engineering and supervision
of the sewerage works and part of the water supply works,
for the water resources desk study and for the management
advisory services have been engaged or are already under
consideration.
