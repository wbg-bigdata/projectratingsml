PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
JAMAICA KINGSTON SEWERAGE I AND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
LOAN 1146-JM
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report of the Kingston Sewerage I and
Water S;pply Projlect, for which Loan 1146-JM was approved in June 1975, in
the sum of USS15.0 million. The Loan was closed in December 1982, and became
fully disbursed in May 1983. There were no cancellations.
The Project Completion Report of June 19, 1985, was prepared by the
Latin American and Caribbean Projects Department on the basis of the findings
of a June 1984 mission, documents contained in regional files and information
provided by Bank staff members involved with the project during its
development and execution. The Borrower (The National Water Commission - The
Commission) was most helpful in providing information, and prepared a Project
Completion Report. NWC's report is available in the files.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Government anc the Borrower for comments. However, no comments were
received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
JAMAICA KINGSTON SEWERAGE I AND WATER SUPPLY PPOJECT
LOAN 1146-JM
HIGHLIGHTS
This project was the second Bank-financed operation in the sector
in Jamaica.  Its objectives were to:  provide water to overcome shortages
during summer months until a source to meet the long-term needs of the
Kingston metropolitan area could be developed; prepare a ;lan for the
development and allocation of water resources; help construct the first
phase of Kingston's sewer master plan; and improve the BorJower's (the
Kingston Water Commission) organization and management.
The water supply components, as modified, were substantially
completed albeit after some delays.   The project also helped define the
next water source to be developed, and the leak detection and repair
program was successfully implemented (para. 3.11). The sewerage component
has yet to be completed.    Incremental production is estimated at about 3
IMgd, versus the appraisal estimate of 5 IMgd on average (para. 4.02).
Production is estimated, because the production meters procured under the
project are not operational (para. 3.07).
The Borrower's financial performance fell short ot appraisal
expectations. Although actual revenues were slightly higher- than projected
at appraisal, they were not sufficient to cover cost increases (para.
5.02). As a result, the Borrower was able to achieve a positive return on
revalued fixed assets in only one year, and its percentage contribution to
investment was lower than expected (para. 5.03).   The Borrower made its
financial ends meet by deferring payment on its accounts payable and debt
service, and by higher than expected borrowings.
In 1978, the Kingston Water Commission was merged with the
National Water Authority, the entity responsible for slpplying water to
areas outside metropolitan Kingston.  In the end, the merger proved to be
too much too soon (paras. 6.02 and 8.04).   The inst'tutional problems
identified at appraisal (paras. 1.08-1.09) continued or became worse under
the new arrangement.
The most important determinant of the outcome of the project was
the difficult economic, political and social environment during most of the
execution period.   High inflation and devaluation of the Jamaican dollar
were major factors in the 20% cost overrun (in current US dollars) and high
operating  costs.    As  consumers'  real  incomes  declined  and  rationing
continued, water bills went unpaid. High unemployment and union pressure



prevented the Borrower from reducing excess personnel, except through
attrition. As the economic and political situation worsened, consultants
and contractors left, and equipment was sent out of, the country.   The
flight of human and physical resources and the violence in some project
areas contributed to the delay in project execution.
The Project Completion Report concludes that many of the problems
afflicting the project were out of the Borrower's and the Bank's control
(para. 8.02).   It finds that more attention should have been directed to
the provision of more, and more appropriate, technical assistance (para.
8.03) and to the full implications of the merger (8.04).    This is the
strategy now being used in the follow-up project (Loan 2422-JM, Water
Supply and Sewerage Technical Assistance and Rehabilitation Project, para.
6.02).

KINGSTON SEWERAGE I AND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01        The project was to improve water supply and sewerage in the
Kingston Metropolitan area.  At appraisal, the area had a population of
more than 650,000 (25% of the country's total population) and was growing
at about 3% annually.   Kingston is the country's capital and coutmercial
center.
The Sector
1.02      Before 1980, the major sector agencies were the Water Commission
of  Kingston-St.  Andrew  (KWC-the  Commission)1/,  the  National  Water
Authority (NWA) and 13 Parish Councils.  In addition, the Water Resources
Department (WRD), under the Ministry of Mines and Natural Resources,
provided advice on surface and groundwater development.   The Commission,
under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Utilities, Communication
and Transport (MPUCT), was responsible for all stages of water supply and
for sewerage services in the Kingston corporate area (paras. 1.06-1.08).
Private entities were also involved in providing water for agriculture and
industry in the Kingston region. NWA, also under MPUCT, covered the rest
of the country, including some suburbs around Kingston.  It provided bulk
water to 13 Parish Councils which were responsible for distribution to
consumers.
1.03.     NWA lacked qualified technical and managerial personnel.  It was
in a weak financial position, relying on Government grants to cover its
debt service and some operating and maintenance costs.   As the Parish
Councils did not always pay NWA for the bulk water they received, the
Ministry of Local Government took responsibility for collecting from the
Parish Councils and reimbursing NWA.
1.04          Discussions an choosing between alternative solutions for
Kingston's water supply highlighted the need to resolve two major,
long-term issues: the potential for conflict between the Commission and NWA
and the need to sort out competing demands for water resources.   These
issues led the Bank to include a covenant in the Guarantee Agreement that
required the Government of Jamaica to define sector organization and
allocation of responsibilities.
1/ The Water Commission and the National Water Authority were merged in
1980  (para.  6.01)  to  form  the  National  Water  Commission.    For
simplicity, "the Commission" will be used to refer to the Borrower.

1.05      The Kingston corporate area relies on water from both surface and
groundwater sources.   The area is subject to droughts which drastically
reduce the amount of water available from surface sources. Although 90% of
the area's population was served by the Commission's water supply system,
water had had to be rationed for up to five months a year in the five years
prior to appraisal.   In addition, high chloride content in some of the
Commission's wells was threatening the availability of groundwater and
prior to appraisal, three wells were taken out of service because of
contamination by sewage.
1.06       The Commission's sewer system served about 20% of the corporate
area's population.  Treated effluents were discharged into the harbor and
the ocean.  There were a few private sewer installations, but most of the
population used septic tanks, privies and soakage pits.   In some areas,
sewage frequently overflowed onto the ground, creating a health hazard.
The lack of sewerage infrastructure had also caused a building moratorium
to be imposed in one of the project districts.
The Borrower and Executing Agency
1.07          The Borrower for the project was the Commission, a semi-
autonomous organization created in 1937. The Commission was governed by a
board of nine members headed by a chairman. The members and the chairman
were appointed by the Minister of MPUCT. The chairman was the chief exec-
utive officer, assisted by a secrecary/manager.  An organization chart is
shown in Annex 1.
1.08      Despite slight progress during execution of the first Bank water
supply Loan2/,  the Commission had serious institutional problems.   The
organizational structure was not suited to the Commission's functions.
Senior management lacked drive and initiative. Inadequate salaries and low
prestige made it difficult to recruit and retain qualified technical and
managerial personnel.   At the same time, there were too many semiskilled
and unskilled workers, and inefficiency resulted in excessive overtime.
The engineering and administrative departments were particularly weak. The
staff was devoted to day-to-day operations and resolving crises, with
little time for planning or defining measures to improve performance.
1.09      The Commission's financial position was poor, mainly because  of
a failure to: (a) reduce operating expenses, particularly labor costs; (b)
introduce timely tariff increases, combined with low production and sales;
and (c) reduce accounts receivable, which were as high as four months of
sales. Its rates of return on unrevalued net water supply fixed assets for
1970-74 were well below the 8% covenanted under Loan 598-JM.  There was a
shortage of cash and the Commission was unable to service its debt to the
Government of Jamaica (GOJ).   There were problems in producing annual
accounts  in particular  and management  information  in general.   Audit
reports were produced only after delays of 12-15 months.
2/ Loan 598-JM, US$5.0 million, approved April 1969 (see Project
Performance Audit Report No. SecM 77-876 of December 13, 1977).

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Preappraisal and Appraisal
2.01       The project was prepared by the Commission, its consultants and
the bank in 1972-73.   Bank involvement began during supervision of Loan
598-JM.  Tne project was originally conceived as a major sewerage project
based on a master plan ccmpleted in mid-1970. Consideration was also given
to financing a separate major water supply project. Because of the strain
large sewerage works were expected to place on the local construction
industry and uncertainty over the merits of alternative water supply
solutions, the Bank recommended in April 1973 that a scaled down sewerage
and interim water supply project be developed.   The major issues during
preparation were the solution to be adopted for long-term water supply and
the Commission's organizational, managerial and financial problems.
2.02        The Bank had continuously urged the Commission to solve its
organizational problems, both during supervision of the first project and
preparation of this project.   The Panamerican Health Organization (PAHO)
had analyzed the Commission's inscitutional shortcomings in 1968 and 1972,
and the Stanford Research Institute had prepared a training program in
1969. The Commission had taken practically no action on their recommend-
ations. The Bank made reorganization of the Commission's Technical Depart-
ment a condition of negotiations.   Preparation of plans and schedules to
reduce excess personnel and set up a training program were also made
conditions of negotiations. Appointment of a general manager, project man-
ager and other key staff was made a condition of Board presentation and,
later, a condition of effectiveness.
2.03        Because of the Commission's poor financial performance during
execution of the first project (para. 1.07), the Bank continued to press
for timely, adequate water rate increases and cost reductions during prep-
aration of the second project, and water rates were increased in November
1974. Sewerage charges remained insufficient to cover costs, and deficits
rose  sharply  after  1969.    The Government was  required  to cover the
deficits, but did so only after KWC's audited financial statements had been
produced. Because audit reports were delayed, Government payments were up
to 18 months late.   The introduction of a revised tariff structure and
increased rates was made a condition of Board presentation.
2.04       The Bank fielded an appraisal mission in January 1974.  Because
of uncertainties in project content and cost and the lack of financial and
other information, the mission could not complete its appraisal. A second
mission visited the country in December 1974 to complete the appraisal.
Negotiations
2.05      Negotiations with representatives of the Commission and GOJ were
held in Washington from April 21-May 3, 1975 and were concluded in Kingston
on May 15-16, 1975. A major issue was project scope.



- 4 -
2.06          The Commission was considering several schemes to satisfy
Kingston's water supply needs.  At negotiations, the Jamaican delegation
informed the Bank that the Commission was going to undertake a US$9 million
program of water supply investments in addition to those under the
project.    The major item in this program was  the development of an
additional water source (Castleton-Devon Pen on the Wag Water River). The
delegation agreed that the program warranted further study and comparison
with the other sources under consideration. It was agreed that the project
would include a desk study of the various long-term water supply schemes.
The study would lead to a recommendation of the next major water supply
scheme to be developed.
Principal ObJectives
2.07       The objectives of the project were to:  (a) develop additional
water sources to overcome shortages during the summer and meet demand until
the next major source could be developed; (b) prepare a plan for the
development and allocation of water resources; (c) help construct the first
phase of the sewerage master plan for Kingston; and (d) improve the
Commission's organization and management.   The project designed to meet
these objectives Is described in Annex 2.
2.08       By the time of the completion mission (June 1984), the sewerage
component had not been completed.    The  consultants  estimate  that an
additional J$5.5 million (about US$1.3 million, both in 1984 prices) will
be required to  complete  the works.    Work was  expected  to  begin  in
mid-1985.   The water supply components, as modified, were substantially
completed, albeit after delays of up to 5-1/2 years.  All but one of the
studies included at appraisal had been finished by December 1977. Studies
added to the project during implementation continued through 1982.   The
technical assistance program ended in 1979 and the training program was
concluded in 1980. Annex 3 gives details of execution and completion, and
compliance with key loan covenants is described in Annex 4.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01       The Loan was approved on June 26, 1975 and signed on July 23,
1975. GOJ had fulfilled its conditions of effectiveness (payment of sewer-
age subsidies and submission of a plan to reschedule the Commission's
debts) by the end of January 1976, but the Commission was unable to fully
meet its conditions (appointment of a General Manager Designate and a
Project Manager and staff) until mid-June 1976.   The Loan was declared
effective on June 23, 1976.
Revisions
3.02        Of the numerous changes in project scope (Annex 3), only the
addition of the Castleton-Devon Pen source development component required a
change in Loan Agreement. This was formalized in July 1977, when the Bank
agreed to include in the project the preparation of final designs and



- 5-
construction of intake works and the laying of a pipeline. When the final
designs of the component were completed, it was found that the construction
costs were too high to be covered by Loan funds. The Bank suggested that
the Commission obtain financing through the Caribbean Development Bank.
The CDB loan, approved in 1980, provided funds through a subloan of Bank
Loan 1775-CRG.
Project Implementation Schedule
3.03       Project execution was initially delayed by weak management, and
slowness in hirtag consultants to supervise the sewerage component and to
prepare the study of alternative sources of supply.   Progress was good
after the new General Manager assumed full responsibility in October 1976,
but deteriorated after his sudden death in August 1979.
3.04        The downturn in Jamaica's economy and social unrest began to
affect project execution in late 1978.  These problems contributed to the
loss of key Commission personnel (para. 6.03). Consultants and contractors
were left shorthanded as key personnel emigrated.   Equipment was shipped
out of the country. As a consequence, there were delays in meeting dead-
lines and the quality of design declined. Vandalism and physical danger in
red areas3/ also delayed sewerage works in the Lower West district, the
mains replacement program in downtown Kingston and work on the Hope filter
complex.  Other problems that slowed project execution included delays in
obtaining import licenses (para. 3.06) and, consequently, letters of credit
with foreign banks; slowness of and political intervention in contract
award; the inexperience of local contractors (para. 3.10); concentration of
efforts on other investments; uncertainties caused by the merger of KWC and
NWC; and difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified technical and
administrative staff.
Procurement
3.05      All goods and services were procured following the Bank's guide-
lines. About 70 contracts were awarded. Contracts for consulting services
and supplies and equipment were awarded to local and foreign firms. Local
firms won all the civil works contracts.
3.06      Procurement was slow throughout the project.  All procurement was
subject to delays caused by cumbersome procedures.   Particular delay was
experienced in all foreign procurement by, first, the difficulty in obtain-
ing import permits, and, second, by the fact that all permits expired at
the end of the year in which they were issued.  Because of the licensing
problem, goods remained on the docks for protracted periods after notifica-
tion of arrival. This resulted in high dockage charges, much breakage, and
loss.
3/ Low-income areas subject to unrest.



3.07              The Commission prepared the specifications to be used for pro-
curement of source meters with the assistance of a supplier. At some place
in the process, information on the electrical supply at various instal-
lations was not thoroughly checked. Many of the meters procured were of
the wrong voltage.   As a result, none of the flow measuring equipment
installed is operational.   In addition,  the chlorination equipment and
turbidimeters procured also proved to be too sophisticated for local condi-
tions and are not now functioning.

-7-
The cost increases were the result of the delays in Xroject execution,
combined with much higher than expected inflation and the devaluation of
local currency.
3.09       Disbursements, shown in Annex 6, lagged behind appraisal esti-
mates because of the delays in project execution.   Reallocations of Loan
funds are given in Annex 7.
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.10      The performance of the coisultants was adequate, but the perform-
ance of the civil works contractors was poor in many cases.  Works were
broken down into small packages to encourage the local industry. The well
drilling contractors lacked the experience and equipment to construct wells
of the diameter and depth required.  Each of the contractors experienced
difficulties, and one went out of businesse  Experience with the sewerage
contractors was mixed. One performed well and a second emerged as a sound
performer after initial problems. Another contractor, whose poor perform-
ance was apparent early in the project, was awarded a third contract
against the Commission staff's recommendation.   The contractor's perfor-
mance was again unsatisfactory. The Commissions's Board did not act on a
subsequent recommendation by the General Manager to terminate the
contractor and call his performance bond.
3.11      One bright spot in contractor performance was the leak detection
and repair program. This contract was carried out on schedule, appears to
have been appropriate to the problem and resulted in the reporting of all
major leaks. The Commission undertook an immediate correction program for
such leaks and the contractor resurveyed each to ensure quality of repair.
The consultant estimated that about 2 Imgd (about 5% of production) have
been saved.
Reporting
3.12         Progress reports of good quality were provided in a timely
manner. Audited financial statements, however, were supplied only after
protracted delays caused by the inadequacy of the Commission's accounting
system. All audit reports were qualified.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01       The severe drought which persisted throughout most of the con-
struction period necessitated rationing of water supply to certain areas by
intermittently valving off sections of the system.   This, along with a
severe cut back in consumption related to the downturn in the economy and a
shift in urban development away from the corporate area led to a leveling
off of demand at amounts very close to those reported at appraisal.
4.02        Because the source meters procured under the project are not
operational (para. 3.07), it is no more possible now than it was at
appraisal to know with accuracy the amount of water produced. Estimates of



water produced must still be used for decision making and evaluation.
Construction of wells resulted in an average incremental production of
about 3 IMgd, versus an incremental 11 IMgd during the dry season (about 5
IMgd on average) estimated at appraisal.
4.03        The Commission continues to be plagued by inadequate mainten-
ance.  Evidence of poor maintenance can be found at almost every instal-
lation. Two of the four augementation wells built under the project are no
longer working. Wells and sedimentation basins are overgrown by weeds, and
pumphouses appear not to have been cleaned within the past year.

7/ Includes J$2.03 of amortization of deferred expenses. Revalued depre-
ciation expense was J$2.51 million (6%) higher than estimated at
appraisal.
5.02      Although actual revenues were slightly higher than projected at
appraisal, they did not keep pace with cost increases.  This was largely
the combined result of insufficient rate increases and inability to contain
costs.   The cost of power and materials rose because of the higher than
expected inflation.   Personnel costs expressed as a percentage of total



- 9 -
costs decreased from 62% in 1975 to about 46% in 1983 (versus 53% coven-
anted, Annex 2).  Nevertheless, personnel costs were higher than expected
because of the Commission's staffing problems (para. 6.03) and because of
several large, government-arbitrated wage settlements.   Sales were lower
than expected because of the effects of the recession on commerce and
industry. In addition, the increase in water connections was about 5% less
than forecast  because of changes in urban development patterns.   The
increase in sewer connections was 35% less than expected.   The result of
the foregoing is that the Commission's returns on revalued fixed assets
were negative in all but one year (Annex 8).

ation of funds suffered from the effects of an increase in accounts receiv-
able.   After an initial decrease to 2.4 months of sales in FY76/77,
accounts receivable rose to the equivalent of 6.0 months of sales in
FY82/83. As real incomes declined and water rationing continued, customers
refused to pay their bills and, in the red areas, refused to allow supplies

to be cut off. In addition, Government agencies did not pay their bills in
a timely manner. The Commission made ends meet by deferring payment on its
accounts payable and debt service, and by higher than expected borrowings.
5.05      The Commission's financial position is expected to improve in the
future. An enhanced rate structure was introduced in October 1983 and will
be reviewed under Loan 2422-JM.4/ A substantial rate increase was imple-
mented in November 1983. During negotiations of Loan 2422-JM, GOJ and the
Commission agreed to implement a financial recovery program.  The program
provides that part of J$29.74 million of overdue debt service will be
treated as an equity contribution and the remainder will be rescheduled as
long-term debt. The program also provides for the repayment of Government
accounts receivable and cost reductions. These actions, combined with the
Government's commitment to improving the Commission's financial position
and the completion of development of a large source of supply (the modified
Blue Mountain scheme) which will eliminate rationing should allow the
Commission to earn a positive net income beginning in FY1984/85.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND STAFFING
6.01          Concern about the fragmentation of sector responsibilities
(para. 1.02) led the Bank to include a covenant in the Guarantee Agreement
that required GOJ to define sector organization and allocation of responsi-
bilities.  In July 1977, the Ministry of Local Government, which was then
responsible for sector activities, recommeded that the Commission and NWA
be merged and that the new organization gradually absorb the Parish Council
operations. The Bank advised against proceeding with the merger because of
the possible adverse effects on the then-improving KWC.   The Cabinet
approved the proposed merger in March 1978, apparently without further Bank
comment. The Bank, at GOJ's request, provided a consultant to assist with
defining the policies and principles underlyir.g the merger.   The two
entities were merged in October 1980, with the assistance of management
consultants.
6.02        The merger did not go well.  The first setback was the sudden
death of KWC's general manager, whose leadership was central to the success
of the merger. Shortly thereafter many key personnel left (para. 6.03) and
were replaced by staff with limited experience with urban operations.  In
the end, a cumbersome organizational set up was adopted, apparently without
major Bank disagreement, and the institutional problems identified at
appraisal continued, or became worse, under the new arrangement. Prospects
fQr the future are brighter, however. As the result of Government-mandated
management audit carried out in 1982, the Government hired a team of
consultants to advise the Commission's senior managers.   This effort is
continuing with the support of the Bank under Loan 2422-JM.
6.03      Staffing remained a critical problem.  The Commission's inability
to set adequate salary scales, the country's economic and political unrest
and morale problems caused by the merger led to continued problems with
recruiting and retaining qualified technical, administrative and managerial

- 11 -
personnel.   At the same time, high unemployment and union pressure  pre-
vented the Commission from reducing staff at lower levels, except through
attrition.  In 1983, there were about 20 employees per thousand water con-
nections in the Kingston Metropolitan area.   Since then, a hiring freeze
has been implemented and staffing levels have decreased to an estimated 18
employees per thousand water connections. Under Loan 2422-JM, the Commis-
sion has agreed to reduce the number of employees per 1,000 urban connec-
tions to 16.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
7.01       The overall internal rate of return calculated in at appraisal
was 11%, assuming a 30-year project life. Combined water and sewer tariffs
were used as a proxy for benefits.   Benefits also included 40% of the
increase in land values expected to result from access to the sewerage
system.  Additional benefits considered, but not quantified, were: reduc-
tion of stream and harbor pollution;  reduction of health hazards;  and
avoidance of the cost to land owners of maintenance of cesspools.
7.02        The internal rate of return has been recalculated (Annex 9).
Combined average water and sewer tariffs were based on actual rates.
Revenues for 1985 and beyond were based on tariffs in effect in December
1984. Changes for making house connections were assumed to equal the costs
of installation. Benefits from the increase in land value are based on the
Commission's figures.   The recalculated internal rate of return is 17%.
The internal rate of return is highly sensitive to imputed land values; if
this benefit were excluded, the internal rate of return would be negative.
Because of the delays in beginning the sewer connection program, the non-
quantified benefits discussed at appraisal have yet to be realized.
7.03       The project was justified at appraisal.  Ti- sewerage component,
however, has proven extremely costly: upon completion, the estimated aver-
age construction cost per connection would be about US$6,800 in current
prices. It is unlikely that the full cost of the works could be recovered
through consumer charges. It therefore appears unlikely that present solu-
tions could be justifiably extended to other areas.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE, CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
8.01        The project was more successful in meeting its physical and
planning objectives than it was in achieving its institution building
goals. The water supply works were substantially completed, but the sewer-
age component remains unfinished, and the sewer connection program was
expected to begin in FY84/85. The source to meet Kingstons long-term water
needs, selected on the basis of a study financed under the project, is now
under construction.   The Borrower's financial, organizational and man-
agerial problems, however, continued throughout the project execution
period.



- 12 -
8.02         Supervision missions visited the country an average of three
times a year. There were relatively few changes in Bank staff for most of
the project cycle.   The relationship between the Bank and the Commission
appears to have been good. In particular, the Commission cites the Bank's
helpfulness in arranging for direct reimbursement as a means of alleviating
the import licensing problem and the Bank's understanding of the problems
facing the Commission.
8.03       Although the Bank's strategy and the project designed to support
it were basically sound (with the possible exception of the sewerage com-
ponent), a myriad of problems during execution adversely affected the pro-
ject. But many of the problems afflicting the project were out of the Com-
mission's, and the Bank's control, given the economic and political climate.
8.04      This project highlights the critical importance of strirg manage-
ment to successful implementation. The Bank's emphasis on appointment of a
strong general manager was proven justified by the marked improvement in
execution in 1976-79.  But the fundamental weakness of this approach was
its inherent lack of sustainability - after the General Manager's death,
performance again deteriorated.   It appears that the Bank should have
directed more technical assistance to the improvement of systems and pro-
cedures, and to definition of appropriate operational and personnel
policies.
8.05        The Bank's attention to sector reorganization was well warran-
ted.   In principle, the merger of the authorities was sound) and ab-.'l.d
have benefitted the country.  But the merger of KWC and NWA did not p
smoothly, to the detriment of the new entity's performance (para. A').
The merger was premature, placing too great a strain on an organization
whose recent improvement proved to be shortlived. In addition, it appears
that the full financial, human resource and organizational implications of
the merger could have been paid greater attention.  Communications remain
poor and lines of command unclear.  These, along with other institutional
problems, have caused the frustration which has contributed to frequent
turnover of managerial and professional personnel.
8.06      The Commission will have to dedicate considerable time and effort
to improving its performance. Some progress has already been made through
the technical assistance provided as a resilt of the Government audit and
later supported through Loan 2422-JM (para. 6.02). With continued GOJ com-
mitment to improving the efficiency of the Commission and campletion of the
Blue Mountain scheme, the Commission's prospects for the future are
brighter.

KINGSTON SEWERAGE I AND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Internal Rate of Return
Assumptions
1.   All costs and benefits are expressed in 1975 US dollars.
2.   Incremental volume sold is based on estimated incremental production
(3 IMgd) and savings from the leak detection program (2 IMgd), less
30% unaccounted-for water.
3.   Inoremental operating costs are based on average power and materials
costs applied  to incremental volume  sold.   Because of the high
employee to connection ratio and the expected decrease in staff
numbers, incremental labor costs have been excluded.
4.   Incremental revenues are based on actual rates for 1981/82-1983/84,
and proJected rates for 1984/85, applied to incremental volume sold.
5.   Connection fee revenues for sewer connections are assumed to equal the
cost of installation.
6.   The increase in land values was assumed to accrue over six years,
ending in 1984/85 (the fiscal year the sewer connection program is to
begin).   The six-year period and the attribution of 40%. of the
increase in land value to the project are consistent with the approach
used at appraisal.
7.   Foreign exchange is not shadow priced.
