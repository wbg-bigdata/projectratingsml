REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO BANCO CENTRAL DE COSTA RICA
WITH THE GUARANTEE CF COSTA RICA
FOR A SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1. *I submit the following report and reccmmendation on a proposed
loan to Banco Central de Costa Rica with the guarantee of the Republic of
Costa Rica for the equivalent of $9 million for a second agricultural
credit project. The loan would have a term of 18 years, including a grace
period of five years, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        Costa Rica has to date received thirteen Bank loans and one IDA
credit totalling $113.5 million. A summary statement of Bank loans and
IDA credits is in Annex I. Six loans, amounting to $73.3 million, have
been made for power and telecammunications; two loans and one credit,
amounting to $25.8 million, for transportation; and five loans, totall-
ing $14.4 million, for agricultural and industrial development. The most
recent loans, for power and telecommunications, were signed in February
1972. No further loans will be presented during the current fiscal year,
but the program for FY1973 includes a loan for education and a supplementary
loan for highways (see paragraph 3)0
3.        As of March 31, 1972, a total of $21.6 million remained to be
disbursed on four ongoing projects (in power, telecommunications, roads and
agriculture). The third power project (Loan 631-CR) is about 24 months
behind schedule, and cost estimates have been increased by about 50 percent
due to difficult tunnelling problems and late delivery of equipment. The
major problems encountered in the tunnel now appear to have been overcome.
The project is under close supervision. The Bank has recently given its
approval to additional borrowings of $2 million by Instituto Costarricense
de Electricidad from a private U.S. bank pending a determination of what
additional measures will be required to cover the cost overrun. For the
road project (664-CR), the Government has requested supplementary financ-
ing to cover a cost increase in the construction of the Siquirres-Limon
highway, on which work was started last year. This request is under con-
sideration.
4.        The proposed loan would be the second for agricultural credit to
Banco Central de Costa Rica. The first loan of $3 million (538-CR) was
approved in 1968. The project for which this loan was made had a very



slow start, mainly because funds for agricultural credit were available
from other external sources, the staffing in the project unit and the
participating banks was unsatisfactory, and the participating banks had
little experience with the preparation of detailed farm plans. The sit-
uation improved greatly in 1970-71, and the loan was fully committed by
August 31, 1971. The undisbursed balance, which on March 31, 1972, was
$1.1 million, is expected to be fully disbursed by June 1972, about
twelve months later than initially estimated.
5.       IFC has made one investment in the form of a loan of $0.6 mil-
lion in Costa Rica to Productos de Concreto S/A, a company manufacturing
concrete products. This loan has been repaid.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
6.       A "Memorandum on Recent Economic Developments and Prospects of
Costa Rica" dated May 4, 1972,is being circulated to the Executive Dir-
ectors and country data are attached as Annex II.
7.       As explained in the memorandum, in order to tackle serious fis-
cal and balance of payments problems, a fiscal package was approved in
.-February 1972, with a program to limit the growth of current outlays,
and, to better cope with the foreign exchange shortage, on March 1 around
one-third of imports were transferred from the official rate ($6.65) to
the depreciated free market rate (t$8.6o).
8.       The Government still faces a difficult task in reducing the bud-
get deficit, but an important contribution is being made by the measures
recently approved and also by the monetary program of Banco Central, which
has sharply reduced credit expansion to both the public and private sec-
tors. The Government is presently negotiating a credit with the Central
American Stabilization Fund and has confirmed its intention to seek a
standby arrangement with the IMF. The current fiscal and financial pro-
grams - if strictly enforced - should help the!Costa Rican econoxqy to
overcome the difficulties of the last few years, while continuing to dev-
elop its considerable long-term potential.
9.        In the longer run, there are good prospects for a resumed high
level of growth. The development strate&r ought to concentrate on expand-
ing exports and diversifying the ec.mai so as to reduce the recurrence of
short-term fluctuations. Investment and growth will have to rely more on
real private and public savings, rather than on inflationary credit expan-
sion. Later in the 1970's various new exports are likely to emerge, includ-
ing exportable agricultural foodstuffs, lumber products and bauxite. Fur-
thermore, if the Central American countries are successful in re-structuring
the Common Market, and in inducing the development of more efficient local
industries, Costa Rica's industry may be able to begin to compete successfully
outside the Common Market. In order to meet the emergenxy backlogs in infra-



-3-
structure, a high level of public investment will be required but will
only be feasible if there is a thorough revision of fiscal policies, to
contain current expenditure growth, and thus permit a sufficient genera-
tion of public savings.
10.       Our current estimates indicate that, in line with annual
output growth of 7 percent, gross capital inflow requirements in 1971-76
would exceed $620 million, compared to $510 million in 1965-70. The debt
service ratio on public debt, which had reached 18 percent in the mid-1960's,
declined to 12 percent in 1970 and rose slightly in 1971 to around 13 per-
cent. If the stabilization package outlined above, and additional measures
to improve credit, fiscal and balance of payments management are effectively
implemented, and provided the bulk of foreign borrowing is made at terms
similar to those charged by the international leding agencies, the burden
of external debt service is expected to remain manageable.
PART III - THE SECTOR
11.      Agriculture plays an important role in Costa Rica's econonmy,
contributing about 25 percent of GDP and 75 percent of total export earnings,
and providing employment for some 40 percent of the labor force. In the
past five years output has increased at about 8.5 percent annually. Most
of this increase has come from export crops, mainly bananas and livestock,
while production for domestic oonsumption (mainly basic grains) has barely
kept pace with population growth. This has led to increasing food imports,
now accounting for about 5 percent of total imports.
12.      The most dramatic development in the 1960's has been a major
banana expansion by U.S. fruit companies and domestic investors, as a result
of which Costa Rica has become the world's third largest banana exporter.
Banana growing has become a major employer and now accounts for about 20,000
people or 10 percent of the agricultural labor force. The main cause of
this expansion of production has been the introduction of new disease-resis-
tant varieties. The structure of Costa Rica's banana industry differs con-
siderably from that in other Central American countries, since a relatively
large share of total 'production is in the hands of Costa Rican nationals
who have long-term marketing arrangements with foreign oompanies.
13.      Beef and sugar also expanded during the 1960's. Between 1960
and 1969 beef production increased by 70 percent and,because of the sub-
stantial margin between export and domestic prices, virtually all of the
increment was exported to the U.S. This led to a reduction in per capita
domestic consumption which, however, was partly compensated by higher per
capita consumption of other animal protein, mainly poultry.



14.       With the exception of rice, production of basic grains has
dropped and is insufficient to meet domestic demand. Corn and beans are
produced mostly by small farmers using traditional, inefficient methods
which result in very low yields. Few of these farmers apply appropriate
fertilizers, protect crops against diseases or prepare the soil adequately.
15.       For the future, considerable opportunities exist for both the
expansion of non-traditional exports, such as beef, and for economical
import substitution. It would be possible to replace some agricultural
imports (mainly corn and beans), increase the domestic supply of products
which were sacrificed for exports (meat and milk), and provide raw mater-
ials (fruits, vegetables) for further industrial processing. Such a policy
would fit into the strategy of generating greater job opportunities outside
the banana and coffee sectors. Finally, in view of the land limitation in
the Central Highlands, the recent effort to extend gradually production to
the Atlantic zone and the north and north-west will be intensified. This
calls for substantial investment in penetration roads, drainage and flood
control (Atlantic Coast), and irrigation.
16.       Increasing government technical as well as financial support is
therefore being given to new crops, further beef and dairy expansion,
forestry, and agro-industry. The Ministry of Agriculture provides country-
wide extension services and research, while the National Production Council
promotes development and also stabilizes domestic food prices through
commodity purchases and sales.  In addition, credit is available to agri-
culture from the banks and several national private institutions.
17.       Development of agriculture is centered around a program designed
mainly to increase the productivity of small farms. Two USAID loans oon-
tracted in 1970 and totalling $20 million, with terms of 40 years at 2-3
percent interest, cover some two-thirds of the total cost. The program
involves a major institutional reorganization (to avoid duplication and
improve coordination among agencies and authorities at different levels),
education, research, extension, provision of modern inputs and credit.
The program's credit component amounts to about $7 million, of which $3.5
million is from USAID , and is channelled through the banking system and
relent to farmers at medium and long-term at 8 percent, with technical
services provided directly by USAID.
18.       The IDB and IBRD are complementing the USAID effort by providing
training and advice and additional credit lines, with emphasis on export
crops. An IDB loan for $6 million, approved in February 1972, with a term
of 20 years at 4 percent, is being relent by Banco Nacional (the largest of
the state-owned commercial banks) at 8 percent interest to medium-sized
ranchers for livestock development. The proposed IBRD loan - like the
first agricultural credit loan of 1968 - would be channelled through the
banking system, and would be relent for a variety of agricultural activi-
ties (see Part IV).

PART IV - THE PROJECT
History
19.       The project was appraised initially in October and November 1970,
but negotiations were postooned in view of the deteriorating fiscal situation
and balance of payments. After an updating mission visited Costa Rica in
September and October 1971, and following discussions with the Government and
Banco Central of Costa Rica on general economic policies, the proposed loan
was negotiated in Washington in March 1972. The Banco Central was represen-
ted by Mr. Claudic Volio, Manager, and the Government by Mr. Marco Antonio
Lopez, Minister of Planning.
Project Description and Costs
20.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Agricultural Credit Project, Costa
Rica" (No. PA-125a, dated April 12, 1972) is being distributed separately.
The main features of the loan and project are suimurized in Annex III.
21,       The project would in the main be a continuation of the first agri-
cultural credit project (Loan 538-CR) for the development of beef, bananas,
cotton and pineapples, but it would also include dairy production, a wider
range of crops (maize, rice, fruits, oilseeds, vegetables and oil palm),
forestry and agro-industries. The proposed loan would finance medium and
long-term investments over a period of three years in land and crop develop-
ment, machinery and equipment, construction and installation, planting mat-
erial and breeding stock, and capital goods and services. Under the heading
of services the proposed loan would cover the foreign exchange cost of
foreign technical experts, particularly in forestry and agro-industry, and
about 15 fellowships for training Costa Rican professionals abroad in such
fields as forestry, agro-industry, farm management, livestock and agricul-
tural credit.
22.       The investment to be financed is estimated to total $16.5 million.
Of this amount $9 million, the estimated foreign exchange cost, would be
provided by the loan now proposed, $4.3 million by the four participating
state-owned ccmmercial banks and $3.2 million by the beneficiaries themselves.
The participating commercial banks would also provide the necessary short-
term working capital to the sub-borrowers. Banco Central has undertaken to
act as a residual source of funds and to back up the participating banks
with the funds required for the project, should the participating banks not
be able to provide them.
Relending Arrangements
23.       The proposed loan from the Bank would be made to Banco Central
at the prevailing interest rate of 7-1/4 percent per annum. Banco Central.,
which would bear the foreign exchange risk, would relend the proceeds to



-6-
the participating banks at the same rate.  Lending by the participating
banks to sub-borrowers would be at an effective interest rate of not less
than 9.75 percent per annum (equivalent to a nominal rate of 9.50 percent
charged quarterly in advance); thus the spread for the participating banks
would be 2.5 percent. Sub-loans would be committed over a three-year period,
though actual loan disbursements would extend for four years. Sub-loans in
excess of $100,000, as well as sub-loans for oil palm and agro-industries,
would have to be approved by the Bank.
Project Administration
24.       Banco Central would be responsible for project administration,
and would act through its Agricultural Credit Department. This Department
is to be strengthened by the addition of four experts in farm management
and agricultural credit,and by the appointment of a Deputy- Director and-
a Regional Representative for the Atlantic Coast area. It would handle
matters concerning agricultural credit policy and would also guide and
assist the technicians of participating banks in their evaluation of sub-
projects.
25.       Participating banks would be the four autonomous state-owned
banks. They are well organized, financially sound, and operate according
to good banking practices. They are adequately staffed and have competent
technical personnel to appraise and supervise sub-projects. The technicians
of the participating banks would, as under the first project, be assisted in
the appraisal and supervision of sub-projects by the Agricultural Credit
Department of Banco Central, as well as by the Ministry of Agriculture and
the National Production Council.
Procurement
26.        Since the investment items are small and varied, bulk procurement
and international competitive bidding would be inappropriate. Imports of
these items are freely permitted, and there is a well established network
of importers and dealers. Spare parts are readily available and arrangements
for servicing agricultural equipment are satisfactory. No accurate estimate
is available of the likely procurement of project items from within the
Central American Common Market, but it is not expected to be substantial;
such items would normally be duty free. Duties on project items imported
from outside the Central American Camon Market are generally not above
10 percent.
Disbursement
27.       When the first agricultural credit loan was fully committed at
the end of August 1971, Banco Central, after consultation with the Bank,
decided to continue making commitments in order to ensure continuity of
agricultural operations started under the first project. It also proposed
that disbursements made on the basis of commitments entered into after
September 1, 1971, be financed retroactively under the second loan, for
which negotiations were expected in early 1972. The proposed loan would
include such retroactive financing for up to $500,O0 equivalent.



-7-
Beneficiaries
28.       The Project is expected to benefit a fairly wide range of
commercial farmers.  The average size of sub-loans for beef development -
the largest category under the Project - is expected to be about $26,000,
as compared to about $57,000 under the first project (Loan 538-CR).
Financial rates of return on the investments to be financed under the loan
range from 18 percent for bananas to 35 percent for forestry.
Economic Justification
29.       Economic rates of retarn on different parts of the project are
estimated to range from 20 percent to 37 percent. About 40 percent of
the beef and all the bananas and pineapples produced under the project
would be exported, with a net foreign exchange value of about $8 million
per annum at full development, and the extra rice and corn production
should yield annual net foreign exchange savings of $0.6 million.
30.       The investments to be carried out under the proposed project
could create a demand for up to some 4,000 job requirements, of which about
half could be in livestock. Many of the investments, however, are for
expansion, and are likely to lead to the more intensive use of existing
labor. This effect is highly desirable, since the rural econoiy of Costa
Rica suffers more from underemployment than serious unemployment.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
31.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Banco Central de
Costa Rica, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Costa
Rica and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft agreements conform to the nonmal pattern for loans
for agricultural credit projects.
32.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECC*MENDATION
33.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
