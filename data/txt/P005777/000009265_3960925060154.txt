SOUTHERN UPLAND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1067-YAR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction and Objectives
1.       This is the eighth IDA supported agricultural project in YAR.  The
objectives of the project were:   (a) to ircrease rural income and living
standards by raising crop and livestock production of about 60,000 farm
families in the Southern Upland Region; and (b) to improve the health of
rural poor by providing potable water and reducing the incidence of water
borne diseases.   To reach these goals the project improved on the
agricultural extension services, provided for credit, carried out bilharzia
control program, constructed roads, and provided for rural water supply
schemes, and completed the feasibility studies and preparation of the final
designs for Wadi Jawf area.
Implementation Experience
2.       The project was completed one year and six months behind schedule.
This was caused by delay in the identification of the well sites for the
village water schemes and construction of some of the extension centers.
Implementation of the 50 dairy farms in the project area also proved
difficult due to the small size of the farms and shortage of feed in the
area.   Furthermore the feed-mixing units which were supposed to be built
and handed over to CACB proved impractical due to high cost of local raw
material. Aside from these minor implementation problems, the project was
executed efficiently and attained the targets for which it was planned.
Proiect Impact
3.       The main objectives of the project in increasing the agricultural
output in the project area and improving the health status of the rural
community through control of bilharzia and water distribution schemes were
reached. The extension service advised farmers on the use of better seeds,
application of more fertilizers and use of pest control means.   Farmers
became aware of better production practices which they applied to their
farms.   As a result farmers'  net income rose by 60% under rainfed
conditions, while under irrigation and high rainfall conditions yields v -e
tripled.  Use of agricultural machinery and implements was also increased
as shown by the numbers sold to farmers in the project area. Provision of
credit, both miedium and short-term credits, also contributed to the ahility
of the farmers to purchase their needs of farm inputs and machinery.



Sustainability
4.       The project components are sustainable with directed efforts of
the Miniscry of Agriculture and Fisheries, especially in areas of extension
and research.   Foremost among these is the provision of farm inputs,
especially the supply of needed fertilizers. Better links would be needed
between research and extension to render the two way flow of information
continuous and effective.   The water distribution schemes would also be
sustainable through mobilization of the Local Development Associations
whose offices are widely distributed in the project area.   Technical
assistance is presently   provided under the third, currently ongoing
follow-up project, SRADP, Credit 1772-YAR, which would further insure
sustainability of the progress achieved.
Lessons Learned
5.       The two project components concerning the control of bilharzia and
distribution of potable water in the villages of the project area gate
publicity to the project as a whole and made the farmers aware of the other
components related to improved agricultural practices.   It is important
therefore that for agricultural projects at least one component should
address directly some issues of immediate interest to the farming
community. It is also important that the sustainability issue be addressed
at the time of appraisal to insure continuity of project benefits after the
closing date.   Any design or recommendation that goes beyond farmers
ability to perform will be ignored and will not contribute to the long term
benefits of the project. The livestock component and the feed mixing mills
are two good examples to support this point.



YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
SOUTHERN UPLAND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (SURDP I)
(Credit 1087-YAR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Overview
Introduction
1.       This overview i s based on a completion report prepared by the Project
authorities in YAR, and submitted to the Bank for review. rne ex-post
economic analysis was carried out by a consultant recruited specifically for
this purpose. Furthermore, the Bank was in contact with the project staff
during the preparation of the report to insure adherence to Bank guidelines as
much as possible.
2.       The Southern Upland Rural Development Project (SURDP II) Cr. 1067-YAR
was a follow-up project of the first rural development project carried out in
YAR. SURDP I (Cr. 545-YAR), which started in 1976 and ended in 1981. The
project under review intensified and strengthened the components started under
the previous project, SURDP I, expanding certain components (extension
services), and adding others (Women in Development). The project extended the
agricultural services from 35,000 ha, under SURDP I to aoout 86,000 ha, under
SURDP II. The extension service covered a wider area, animal health services
were improved, rural water supply schemes were increased in number to cover
more villages, and project management and technical supervision were
st onethened.
3.       The objective of this overview is to indicate where the project
achieved its targets and where it made only limited progress. No attempt is
made here to present a detailed account of project implementation which is
well covered in the PCR submitted by the Gov'-rnmant, a copy of which is
attached.
Project Objectives
4.       The objectives of the project were:
(a)  to increase rural incomes and living standaLds by raising crop
and livestock production of about 60,000 farm families living in
the highlands of Taiz and Ibb Provinces; and
(b)  to improve the health of the rural poor by providing potable
water supply and reducing the incidence of water-borne diseases.
5.       Specifically, the project aimed at (i) expanding and intensifying
agricultural and home e=onoic extension services, building of 44 extension
centers and 5 block center.; (ii) expanding livestock health and production
services, poultry and honey production, including a fodder and feed production



- 2 -
scheme to improve nutrition and management of local cattle on a group of
selected farm, and establishment of s demonstration feed mill; (iii) provision
of credit for agricultural inputs and livestock; (iv) provision of rural
infrastructure development by providing engineering assistance to the Local
Development Assoc4ation (LDA), constructing 100 water supply schemes, offices,
stores and housing units for permanent staff of the Southern Upland Rurai
i;evelopment Unit (SURDU) and the Agricultural Research Station in Taiz; (v)
provision of additional vehicles, equipment, staff training and consultants
for SURDU central services; (vi) provision of funds to extend the Bilharzia
control campaign and carry out the statistical surveys necessary for adequate
monitoring and evaluation; and (vii) completion of feasibility studies and
preparation of final designs for agricultural development of the Wadi Al Jawf
area.
Project Design and Organization
o.       The project was designed to extend the agriculture service to about
86,000 ha, includIng 35,000 ha covered under the previous project, SURDP I,
mainly in the high land areas, which are intensively cultivated.  In addition                P
to agricultural services and credit, the project would provide for village
water schemes for an estimated population of about 300.000.  The beneficiaries               -
would contritute about 40% of the cost to finance one-half of the cost of
machinery, anid full costs of access roads, pump houses, and distribution
networks from the storage reservoirs to their respective villages.
7.       To implement the objectives of the project, expatriate staff in the
field of management, extension and engineering would be appointed and needed
vehicles and equipment were to be supplied.  Furthermore, the project would                  R
provide technical assistance to LDAs in the construction of rural roads. For
the control of bilharzia, the proiect would finance the logistical support
needed by WHO specialist to establich and monitor a program for effective
control of the disease. Upon its completion, the program would be transferred
to the MOH, as part of the nationil health Irogram.
8.       The Project would be implemented in four years, executed by the
Southern Upland Agricultural Development Unit (SURDU), except the credit
component which was executed by the Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB) in
coordination with SURDU. Except for the dairy part of the livestock component
(see paras. 20 and 21), the project was well prepared and well received by the
project beneficiaries.
Source of Finance
9.       In addition to IDA which contributed US$ 17.00 M (SDR 13.00 M), the
Swiss Development Corporation (SDC) contributed USD$ 6.00 M, the Abu Dhabi
Fund US$10.00 M, and IFAD US$ 14.00 M. The YAR Government and the
beneficiaries also contributed an equivalent of US$ 22.00 M and 12.6 M,
respectively, bringing the total project budget to US$81.6 M. The financial
plan was as follows:

Project Implementation
10.      Project implementation started soon after the Credit became effective
on June 26, 1981. There were only minor revisions made to the project during
implementation. These included increasing the number of Block Centers from 3
to 5, and decreasing the number of Extension Centers from 50 to 44.
Furthermore allocation of funds towards construction of staff housing for the
Agricultural Research Authority (ARA) was negotiated and reduced from US$1.3 M
to US$ 0.61 M. Instead of housing, the new allocation was used for ancilliary
needs of ARA, such as building of a water tower, sewerage, and establishment
of an electrical power station in its new location at Dhamar, in the Central
Highlands. Furthermore four offices were constructed for Cooperative
Agricultura. Credit Bank (CACB) to facilitate easy access to beneficiaries.
11.      Extension activities were provided from 8 block and 71 extension
centers, which were backed up by subject matter specialists. A total of about
1500 villages weri covered in the project area. The methodology used was a
modified T & V e-.tension system, whereby each extension agent selected contact
farmers whom he visited more or less on regular basis. He was backed up by
SMSs from whom he received periodical training.

12.      The feasibility study of Wadi Al Jawf, for which funds were allocated
under the project was completed, albeit at a higher cost than estimated at
appraisal (US$0.3 M as against US$0.7 M actual).
13.      Training of project staff exceeded appraisal target as additional
funds were made available from other sources, for a total of 413.5 M/M, of
which 41M/M were used towards MSc. degree in Engineering, and 14 M/M for CACB
activities. The total number which benefited from the training program was 129
staff members.
14.      With respect to the Bilharzia component the project collected
baseline data, inspected sources of drinking water supply and degree of
contamination, in addition to checking individuals for infection in the
project area. Under this scheme, over 200 sources of water were examined,
100,000 individuals were checked, and 46,000 persons received treatment.
These activities were continued under the project till the end of 1985, after
which it was handed over to the local Red Crescent Society, under the Ministry
of Health.
15.      Other services provided under the project included:
(a) veterinary services, vaccinating about 400,000 heads of
cattle, sheep and goats, and treating about 280,000such
animals for the control of internal and external parasites;
(b)  d_..stribution of livestock, beehives and poultry, though on
a limited scale;
(c) disbursing of YR16.5 M as short and medium term credits to
project farmers through CACB;
(d) provision of village water supply scheme whereby 103 such
schemes were constructed in 170 villages, benefiting over
65,000 inhabitants
(e) establishment of 176 home economic centers for women in
development activities, and setting up of home gardens and
orchards as means of improving sk.lls in the production of
vegetables and fruits.
16.      Due to delays encountered in locating suitable well sites under
village water schemes, the closing date of the project was extended twice.
The first extension was for one year, bringing the closing date from December
31, 1985 to December 31, 1986. A second extension was authorized for 6 months
which brought the final closing date to June 30, 1987.
Project Accomplishment
17.      Although somewhat delayed, the project did well in the implementation
of the physical needs of the project, such as building the block and extension
centers, provision of village water schemes, and procuring vehicles, equipment
and material needed under the project. In addition the Bilharzia scheme
proceeded well, judging from the number of people treated and number of
drinking water sources protected. Furthermore the project carried out the
overseas training component efficiently, and completed the Wadi Al Jawf
feasibility study as required ur.der the project. Vaccination activities of
the livestock in the project area also proceed well.



18.      The credit component was fully disbursed.  There was much discrepancy
in the number of short versus medium term credits made under the project. The
number of medium-term loans exceeded those of the short-term by about
six-fold. Hence most of the credit went towards the purchase of machinery,
spare parts, irrigation schemes and poultry, rather than towards purchase by
small farmers of inputs, such as fertilizers, pesticides, seeds and sprayers.
The amounts of the two categories of loans disbursed were YR 96.1M of medium
loans as against 16.5M for short loans.
19.      The agricultural extension activities was strengthened but not to the
level targetted under the project. Visits to farmers fields were not as
regular as it is claimed in the PCR due to lack of transport facilities.
There was also some delay in the construction of the block and extension
centers due to security concerns in some of the areas under the project.
Linkage with research was somewhat strengthened under the Project through
occasional meetings of the SMSs with the research staff.
20.      Under the livestock component, the appraisal target of establishing
50 dairy farms under the project met with complete failure. It appears that
the appraisal target was too ambitious, considering the terrain of the project
area, and availability of irrigation water, and feed. Most of the farms could
support but one cow, of a size not too much different from the local breeds,
to keep feed requirement within the capability of the farmers.
21.      The idea of advocating establishment of small units of feed-mixing
plants which would be transferred to CACB and/or private interest groups also
failed. Although one such plant was finally built, it was found that the
operating cost was too high, due to high cost of local raw material and, in
some cases, their non-availability. TIe CACB was not interested in the scheme
and the idea never took off. The plant that was built now lies idle in the
location where it was built.
Nroject hmpact
22.      Inspite of some shortcomings as discussed above, the project did have
a positive impact. The most notable outcome of the project is the increase in
yield of crops observed. Although the extension staff could only visit
limited number of farmers, the idea of using fertilizers, chemicals, and
better seeds has become widespread. Not all the credit for this trend should
go to the present project, since the effort has been carried over from
earlier SURDU I Project, Credit 545-YAR, and from activities of the country's
main research organization located in the same area. (see Appendix I). In
addition, import restrictions on vegetables, fruits and poultry raised prices
which accounted for higher farm income.
23.      Part of the increase in yield could be attributed to improvement of
health through provision of clean drinking water source for the village
inhabitants, and saving of many working hours for the farm families which are
being utilized in other activities on the farm. Control of Bilharzia, through
treatment of infected villagers and control of snails contributed
significantly to better health of the rural population under the project.



-6-
Bank Performance
24.      The Bank had maintained continuous contact with the project
authorities, through regular supervision missions, which were composed of
varied specialists in agriculture, engineering and finance, who followed up on
the implementation of the p.oject components. There were 12 such missions
during the life of the project of 6 years, i.e., 2 missions per year. The
Bank assisted the project in the implementation of the project components,
especially in establishing strong linkage with research efforts in the
country. In addition, the Bank helped in procurement matters and in the
identification of the expatriate staff assigned to the project.
Borrower's Performance
25.      The project was managed efficiently through appointment of an
experienced local project manager, and adequate expatriate staff in the fields
of agriculture, engineering, M&E, and finance. Physical implementation of the
project was given priority, and procurement of logistic needs of the project
proceeded rapidly. In order to overcome deficiency in training of extension
staff and increased involvement in crop verification trials at the field
levels, the project management established stronger liaison with the ARA.
Construction of extension centers also went ahead as scheduled, except in one
area where political disturbances delayed construction to the last year of the
project.
Economic Rate of Return
26.      The PCR estimates the benefits resulting from the project at 26X,
which is higher than the 23.5% economic rate of return (ERR) estimated at
appraisal. IDA staff now estimates the project rate of return to be about 16%
which is considered satisfactory. The downward adjustment of project benefits
is attributable to: (i) slackness in the extension effort and a slower rate of
adoption by beneficiaries, and (ii) delays in timely provision of project
recurrent costs; furthermore, some of the productivity gains are attributable
to exogenous factors, such as increased use of irrigation.
27.      Some of the factors which contributed to improvement in the net
return of the farmers under the project are: (i) diversification of crops,
i.e., inclusion of fruits and vegetables in the cropping system, in addition
to raising poultry and practicing agriculture; (ii) improvement in the level
of crop and animal production as a result of widespread plant and animal
protection practices; (iii) improvement of the general health of the village
workers as a result of Bilharzia control program and better available
nutrition and potable water; (iv) raising the awareness of the farming
community to availability of credit and their guidance through the extension
service for appropriate investment; and (v) increasing the role of women in
agriculture; and (vi) restrictions on agricultural import (fruits, vegetables
and poultry) also contributed to higher prices for agricultural production,
increasing thus farm income.
Issues and Constraints
28.      During the course of implementation of the project, there were some
managerial, financial and operational difficulties. The managerial difficulty



arose as a result on insufficiently trained staff, lack of sufficient
authorization and absence of internal administrative regulations which would
define authorities and responsibilities of project stauff. In addition, delays
in the construction of some of the extension centers and village water schemes
occurred due to security concerns in some areas in addition to unavailability
of sufficient staff at the LDA levels.
29.      The financial difficulties arose due to delays in the implementation
of the project components which led to, escalation of prices, while sufficient
local funds were not made available to make up for the inflation. There was
also shortage of fund for adequate staffing of the project and their much
needed training. Furthermore, the salaries of the extension staff were below
acceptable norms which led to the resignation of some staff, especially in
hardship areas of the project.
30.      Extension/research linkages remained weak for a long time in addition
to insufficient staff and transport for monitoring and evaluation of project
components. These factors may cast some shadow on the accuracy of the data
presented. As the PCR notes, there is need to ensure availability of mineral
fertilizers, both of the right quality and in the right quantity to sustain
the increased productivity achieved under the project. This matter was taken
up recently with the Government during Country Implementation Review and it
was agreed that private suppliers would supplement CACB in providing
agricultural inputs.
31.      The project achieved successfully the goals set.  This was due to the
fact that the project components responded to immediate needs of the farmers
living in the project area. The foremost of these is the provision of potable
water through implementation of village water schemes which benefited 1071
villages, with about half a million inhabitants, in addition to treatment of
over 4700 individuals for the control for Bilharzia.
32.      Appointment of an efficient project manager, assisted by a number of
expatriate staff, also helped in the implementation of the project components
in an orderly manner, with as little bureaucracy as possible. The fact that
the Project Unit was semi-autonomous gave the already efficient manager some
room to maneuver in its day-to-day work plans.
Project Sustainability
33.      The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries is committed to sustain
extension activities as part of its commitment to agricultural development in
the country. Flow of new technologies to project farmers will depend on
implementation of priority research programs by ARA. and transfer of the
findings to thbe extension service through strong research/extension linkages.
At present, the Bank is supporting both extension and research efforts in the
country and it is expected that technical support to extension would be
continued and extension/research linkages will be strengthened and
maintained. The village water schemes would be sustained through the LDAs,
due to pressure from the beneficiaries and their contribution towards
installment of the system. In addition under SRADP which is a follow-up
projec' to SURDU, technical assistance has been provided towards operation and
maintenance of the village water schemes. The sustainability of the gains



- 8 -
achieved under the project depends critically upon the certainty of the
availability of inputs and further strengthening of the extension services.
Provision of adequate budgetary resources in a timely manner, better
incentives and a career path for the extension staff, adoption of an
appropriate training program for women, both in home economics and
agricultural externsion, and a closer linkage between research and extension
activities are among the key areas which should receive greater attention.
Lessons Learned
34.      Inspite of few shortcomings of the extension system and inefficient
execution of the credit component, the project as a whole is considered
successful in raising the standard of living of the farmers in the project
area. Crop yields were increased through the use of better seeds, use of
plant protection means, diversification of crops, and use of fertilizer.
Publicity attached to the project through its involvement in the establishment
of village water schemes and control of Bilharzia contributed to the farmer's
awareness to follow better farming practices. The project management and the
supporting expatriate staff also contributed to better execution of the
project components.
35.      An important lesson learned is that in the execution of any
agricultural project, it is essential that the project is designed to fill an
urgent need of the farming community, which in this case was the dire need of
the farming community to better source oi drinking water and the control of
Bilharzia. These two components gave publicity to the project and lead to
better recognition of the project's other component, such as credit and use of
improved agricultural practices. As a result, the LDA's became more
cooperative in supplying building sites for the construction of extension and
block centers.
36.      To summarize it may be concluded that the success of the project was
due to the fact that it catered to the needs of the farming community in the
project area and that it had sufficient publicity due to the support it gave
for constructing village water schemes and in controlling Bilharzia.
Furthermore, the Project Manager, assisted by the expatriate and local staff,
carried out his tasks fairly well.
37.      The project would have had an even higher rate of success had the
linkage with research been stronger, the training of the extension staff more
adequate, the extension staff more mobile, and the distribution of the credit
component more equitable. Furthermore, technical assistance provided for the
operation and maintenance of the water schemes was less than satisfactory.
There has been problems in the repair and maintenance of the village water
schemes, for which adequate provisions were not set up to insure
sustainability. Future projects would address these issues to insure
sustainability in the long run.

The major 5mWA of the rural development strategy of the Government of
yena Arab Republic is to increase      food production and to improve the
otandard of livine of the rural families. Large investnents are being
made in different areas of YAR in this rDspeCt.
The Southern Uplands Rural Development Project (Pha" II) contains the
stratoa elemant of the agricultural development and that of improving living
conditions. The improvement of living standards will be achieved through the
rise of family income improvement of quantity and quality of foods provision
of vill,ge water supply, control of bilharsia ad education of male faruer
snd rural women through mans coamunication and home economic classes reepecti-

This pbaao II of the project (1981 - 1986) is a continuation of Phase S
(1976 - 1981) aimed at the rural development of the southern uplands area (Tais
and Ibb Govarnorates). The project area is considered to be the best potential
area of YAR from the agriculture point of view.
Following a request of the Government of YAR, FAO10        Co-operative Progb.
ra_mm (FAO/CP) missions visited the area to identify and prepare the project..
The identification report dated July 31, 1978 was followed by a preparatioa

The main goal of the agricultural activities was to raise the production
of crops in 46000 hectaresr Crop yields in the 52000 hectares directly served
during implementation of the project exceeded the production target in the
majority of the crops. The most pronounced increase.was in fruitas vegetables

A. Project Baokuomd
The Goverment of Yemen Arab Republio (YAR)has approached the Intoez-
national Developmnt Association (IDA) to help finance a rural develop-
ment projeot in the souther higblands of the country (Tais anA Ibb over-
noratoa)* the pojeot originated aa the Southemn Uplaids Rural Develop-
ment Projeat (8UDP l)(Ozedit 545 -YA) oofinanoed with the Abi Dhabi
Fund. SURDP I %w the first rural development effort in YARE. It became
effective in eewly 1976 and ended in June 1981.
Fbllowing JUNDP I a second phase was initiated to enlaree and extend
the activities in the Tais and Ibb Governorates. The new project denoted
as the Southern Uplands Rural Development Project Phaea II (SURDP II) be-
came effective in July 'd* 1981 and was planned to be completei about Dec-
ember 1985, but the closing ate has been extended to Od of Sune 1987.
The principal objective of MURDP II was to improve living conditions
of rural people and raise farm incomes in the Ibb and 2ais Governorates
where 3d* of the couAtry4o population lives and 20% of its cultivated larA
is locatedo The Government of YAR used the project as a means of firmly
establishing the services of the MAP including that of the C¢CB in the
nouthern h4gblands*
3. The Aprigultural Seotor
The following are the main features of the characteristics and perfor-
mance of the agricualtural sector.
(:!) YA s an open eoonoqy with Government intervention in rural areas
limited largely to a coumitment to provide policy guidance, pro-
jeot financing for infrastructure and credit in some areas9 and
train the manpower needed to serve the aricultural seotor
(b) natural resources are scarce, with enough rainfall to maintain a
repularly arable area of only about 1.3 million ha out of a total
land area of 20 million hfl of which about 15% is irrigated;
(o) the virtual absence of basic government services in some regionst
and lack of proper pbpical infrastructure, particularly access
roads;
(d) traditional aaiculture, evidenced in terraces on the highlandsl
qeotem  of  water diversion and irrigation and crop patterns do-

generates about 40% of the countryes GD,P employu 70% of the rem
sident labour force an accounts for more than 90% of total es
ports. D#nizg the 1976/1981 five year plan the share of oiwuli-
ture rewched 3$^ of total GDP and the growth of the agricultural
GDP was estimLted to average an annual rate of 1%. A deaase in
relative GDP ocourred afterwards (30% in 1985) with 1% an&=al in.
crease in aerioulturel
(g) a oontinuous increase in area and production is observedL for maiseg
vegetables1potatot fruits ant qst with a decline of sorghum  millet
and cotton. The poor weather conditions affected crop produation
particularly the lack of rainfall during 1983 and 1984. Mm ooeo_
ercial egps and broilers production have made good progress hbow
ever livestock, fisheries and forestry have failed to keep up with
crop production.
C. MaLor Constraints
The most pressing problems of YTeeni agricil.ure ares
lack of agricultural production to meet the growdg demand of consumption.                     F
deoline of exporta and continuous raise of agricultural imports that reach'
ed about 2223 million YRL is 1982 comwpred to imports value of about 1452
million YRL in 1978/1979 (Ann   1, Table i)j frageented holdirge with rela-
tively small sizes (Anne" 1, Tables 2 & 3); barrier of the wide spread howe
cropping system (Annex 2) to agricultural innovation dependenoe of most
cultivated area on rainfall (Anne  1, Tble 4) and sburtge of firtiliusw
during the last few yearse The most important task the Government ha, set
for itself in setting priorities and eelecting projeots for agricultural
ad rural dev.lopment is to enwure that equity and improvemenrt in the qpal-
ity of life will be achieved while increasing productivity.
B.    eVWAnr=t Plan  AM2 PolicLie
*   l. Government policy iz to encourage ap'ioultural and rural developuent
in different areas.  Large investments are being made in IDA arA SURD? areas
where a system of agricultural extension has begun to function with positive
resmlts. Activities are expanding towards Central Highlands, Al JSef and
other areas of the country.



Under the first Five Year Plan for 1976/77-1980/81 the resourcee all.-
cated to agricultwu were set t YRLe 2.6 billion (USD.587.4 million), or
14% of the total inveetment outlay eanvisaged in the Plan. Abawt YRL. 1.4
billion would be for some 60 agricultural or rural de-elopmsnt projects in
the publio sector, BRLa 1.0 billion in the private and YRLa 0.2 billion in
both sectore. High priority was aasigned to projects for areas with the
beat agicultural potential, e.cG Tihama and central and southern highlandr
and to the training of manpower.
Under the Second Pive Year Plan for 1981/1986, flnde allocated to agri-
cultural and rural development projects were distributed over 57 projecto,
23 of which are new azd 35 belonged to the previous Plan. The allocated furau
totaled IlU.3825 edllon   of which M WWO million from the public and
corporation sectors (64b6%) and M. 1355 mllion (35.4%) from the private
and co-operative sector. Priority was given to irrigation projects9 DUA
SURD? 1  and other rural development projects in addition to plant production
projects.
The Ooperative Agricultural and Credit Bank (formerly Aericultural
Credit Bank, ACB, and Agricultural Credit Fundg ACF) have established a sys-
tem of fam credit serving the major agricultural areas*

2. Socio Economic Features
The total population of the two Governorates was estimated to be
315578 C  1643501        in Taizs and    1511879      in Ibb )
acoording to 1986 censu. Population growth in YAR reached 3% annually.
The rural families of both Governorates are 311325   ( 151732 in Taiz and
159593 in Ibb). These represent 35 % of the total rural families in YAR
t 878301  family)s according to census of 1986*
Out of the total 222176 agricultural holdings of the two Governor._
test about 54% are smaller than 0.50 ha but they represent only 15% of the
agricultural land. Average size of holding is 1.2 ha in T1is and 0.9 ha in
1ab Governorate compared to YAR mean of 2.3 ha  (Annex 1, Table 2).  The
data obtained from the present area of SURDP I and In indicated higher av.-
rags holding size (1.4 ha).
I.cording to the Agricultural Census of 1984. (Annex 1, Table 3) only
19% of the holdings (8% of the area) are totally share cropped or rented.
However5 prxeset share cropping is of greater importance particularly in
zeae lrrigated by wells.

3. Cron Production
The cultivated area within the two Governorates reaches 203816 ha of
which 107001 ha in cultivated in Tais aM  96815 is under cultivation
in Ibb. Ihe total cultivated area of YAR is 1019868 ha (Anne  1I
Table 5).
Total rainfed area amount to 94993 ha in T5 and 90940 ha in Ibb
(total of 185933 ha) whereas the irriguted area reaches 12008 ha in
Tais and 5875 in Ibb (total of 17883 ha )(AM= 1, Table 4).    dSte
of the agricultural censAus (8% irrigated area) are relatively loww than
estimated by sUIRP staff (about 20% irrigated awea)s moat probably due
to areatim of mae     irriotion scheme. sinee the exeution of the
cenus in 1979/1980.
An presented in Annex 1 (Tables 5,6,7) field crops occauy most of the
cltivated area (92% ) with sorghm and millet being the main crops (68%)*
Other crope varied i.e. maize (8.), wheat (4%),barley (5%) and vegetabl-
es (2.4%). Compared to YAR, Taiz arA Ibb Governorates grow 21% of sor-
ghummillet area 52% of maise, 48% of uixed cereals and about 20% of
each of wheat and barley in additicato 30a'37% of veg_tabe  a- *wW30 of
fruit..
In 1985 the project area (Taiz and Ibb Governorates) produced 21% of
YAR sorghum - millet, 52 % of maize* 20% of wheats 17% of barley, 12%
of Alfalfa 6% of each of pulses and sesame (Annez Is Table 8). It
produced also 76% of YAN potatoes, 37% of oniong 43% of garlico 97% of
beans, 76% of carrot, 78% of leek (Annex 1 Table 6) and 31% of mango9
29% of figs, 48% of guava, 23% of quine sad about 10% of each of banu-
aat peAches a   pomegranate (Amnez 1, Table 7).
Although rillage water sipply acheme has higher priority, irrigation
scheme are continuously increasing. Irrigation is used mainly for
fruits, vegetables, potatoes, maize, qat and ooffee, Pruit.9 vegetab

F. HaldinAs And Land Tenure
A4riculture in the Southern Uplands is coniucted on different sized
holdings (Annew It Table 2). Of a total of 222176 holdings, about 54%
of them are smaller than 0.5 ha (15% of area), 35% are between 0.5 - 2.0
ha (33% of area); 8% are between 2.0 - 5-0 ha (24% of areo). The rest
are holdings over 5.0 ha each. In Thiz bigear holdingsp>5.0 ha (43% of
area) are mare frequent than in lbb (11% of area), but the reverse in
tme for smaller-eised holding. (C 2.0 ha). The later constitute about
35% of Tais area and 62.5% of Ibb area.
3ue to the presence of small and fragmented holdings (Anmex 19 Table 2),
migration and the overgrowing widespread of irrigation1 share cropping hAs
gyjyjmportance in the areae Terms of tenancy are different. In relo.
tively isolated areas the tenants share tends to be smaller and their
obligations maore rigid than in areas near other sourees of employment or
where the emigration of lanAless workers has been heavy. In a few areas
labor scarcity has resulted in the full assumption of input cost. by lanzd.
owners. In maost areas, however, the tenant still bears the full cost of
inputs, which results in a proportionally higher income to land owners
than,to tenants from the application of additional inputs to increase
yields and production. In general1 the share of the tenant of rainfed
cereals is 50 - 75% of the crop, while for irrigated crops yield is di-
vided in the share of 25% for land ownrm25% for well owner and 50% to
the tenant who bear all input costs. Eviction of tenants is unsumal and
generally tenancy is inherited. Fixed rental rates are very rare because
they imply a larger deGree of risk to the tenant and do not allow for
sharing in crop success and failure.
The Economic Commimsion for Western Asia (ECWA) has reported on the &op
Sharing and Land TenafnCy Practices (CHLTP) in YAR in 1980 (Annem 2).
UVL baa upiated      the previous CHLTP study.  The current share crop-
ping data of the new study is that generally tenant obtains 5o% of yield
in rainfed areas; two thirds in irri-ation arcaa with share of land owner

g. Rural Infrastructure
Taiz and Ibb ¢overnorates are served by about 1000 rA of tar   roads,
the most important of which is the main road connecting Sanam with Ibb
and Taiz provineal capitals and extends to Al Rahida, Turba and Iodeidalb
At present other additional roads are under construction (Ibb - Udiei in
Ibi' Al Barh - Waslyah in Taiz) and there are plans for other roa:e par-
ticularly in Ibb (Kitab - Damt; Ibb Qatqba,) Nost rural comimnitieo aro
now conneated to the main roads by a few thousands of kilometeru of fee-
der track roads built by Local Councils for Co-operative Development (LOCD
previously denoted as Looal Development Aoaaciation LDA) Due to low
cost of construction and insufficient maintenance such roads are of poor
quality.
Local infrastructure are greatly lacking to satisty the everprowiing needs
of rural populationa for educations bhalth and water. SUDP I and II has
constructed water supply schemes which serve about 6,OOO individuals:
65 schemes under SURDP I and 104 schemes under SUhDP II. In futuro the
provision of pottable water will not be any more the responuibility of
the new project. In addition to the water schemes constructed by SURDP
LCCD haVe constructed > 1000 #illese water supply adh"me in both
Taiz and Ibb. At present there are about 193# g           d abebM  119 bhalth

2.  Revision
TMe pfoial targets and their finaxcial allocation prescribed in the
Crdit Agrement were subjected to very mnr revision asly be
of cout oscaltion due to inflationl ditn6g the yers of project inple-
matation and the delay of AU cainattsent becase of delay of ARA
facilities needed prior to housing (D.C. Agreement Seotion 4.13).

In addition the construction of RA hoswuing wa supposed to be/lien of
the axisting IAR  facilitiea in Tais which were to be used by the UAp a
it. provincial offioes. ARA refused to lave their Tais facilities
to the Provincial ULP offioas and npgotiations failed betwen  SURDP
aid ARA in this respect. Consequantly a revision was made in JuUo 1986
to allocate the usaflocated funds to different s*tiv'ities where the ARL
activities were allocated UR 0.61 million for civil works and goods

According to the well designed and analysed oocprehnaive survey of SURDP
II completed in February 1986, the project is disseminating extension mses-
ages directly to 59819 farming famiies manning a total crop area of 89293
hectares grown to field# vegetable *  fruit and coffee Crops.  The segre-
gation of 9URDP II and I areas allocated 52000 ha of not total crop area a6
exclusively belonging to 9URDP l  (Anne  3, Table 1) that are manned by 34819
farming families. If indirect services is included one expecta that about
20% more area should be considered (additional 10,000 ha).

to high yield increases in different crops particularly potatoes, vegem

However, alfalfa was the only crop that has not reached the appraised
yield level under irrigation.
The fact that in same inntansees actual yield level in the without
project area was below the appraised one may be due, asog other factors,
to shortage of mineral fertilisero insufficient or in appropriate use
of pewticide. unweeding use of low quality inputs... eto. In some areas
there has been lack of intereat to grow wheat, barley and sometimes
coffeo. Orowing other crops (potatoos, vegetables and fruitu) ic more

Be Itension Activities
1l  algck and Extension Centres
The extension servicea are provided to the faumer through th e xb.
ension agents stationed at 8 block centres and 71 ertensiou centroe
who are backed up by officers and experts in different deciplineso
5hree block centres are located ia Tais Governorates  Houbang Turba
and Barh and 5 are located in Ibb Governorates qgida, Shasei  Yarizm
Baddah and Udein (Amnex 4 Bhows distribution of extension entres).
2. Villaest Served
Direct services were provided to inhabitants of 1513 villageuo 817
villages in Tuis and 696 villages in Ibb (Annex 3 Table 2).
3; Services and Beneficirie-s
'The extension service is organized on a fairly rigid pattern tfitus-
need by the T & V sy8tem where each estension agent selects yearly a Zroup
of 4 - 5 pilot farmers and about 40 contact farmers where they meet
regularly. The rangS of extension objectives ensures that upto date
information on needced activities ia diseemenated to farmers through
prolrammes of demonstration techniques and mass communications. The
coordinated progaammes of SURDP divisionsto farmers training and the
widespread coverage of activities leaves no signifiucint farmers outside
th. extension efforts. Keasures are taken to make foanere aware of the
existnce and the economia benefits of the techniquea of proper agrio-
cultural and horticultural production, control of pestus operation end
maintenance of machinery, use of mechanizatio4 animal Ibusbandary...
etc.
Demonstration equipments and aide, sprayers and agricultural machinery
were distributed to the block centres; Demonstrations are held on
farmers fields with the participation of as many fanmers au possibl-e to
arise farmers interest and conviction that will result in the noeded
behavioral chancene
Table 5.2 presents the number of farmers benefited from extension
servicesw pilot and contact farmers, demonstration fields, areas anl
trees protected from peots, field days, extension leaflets and mess-
ages distributed. It is therefore clear how much the extension act-
ivities have contributed positively to crop productivity.

6. Horticultural Nurseries
qh^ two m-rseries at Warazan (Taiz) and Ibb (Sbb) have produced a total
of 2299181 seedliogs of fruitog coffee, efforestation and ornamental
plants. Total fruit seedlings were 1209340oheieas coffee and affore3taor
tions and ornamentals were 572099 nd 517742 seedlings respectively (Annex
5, Table 1). The MA? statistics refer to only 555 heotarosof fruits and
1509 bectare of coffee being grown in the project area which io thought
by 9URP staff to be an under estimate, but no o .wr data are availablen
Many seedlings have been sold in "few numbers" rather thaz in "large
umbers" (oAmen 5, Table 2), but such trend may be expected in the beginn-
iag where farmers arezkeen to "know" the trees and to secure family con-
sumption of fruits beacmae of the ban of importation, but trend is chaAug'-
inc towaeds more commercial production.
Co Livestock
The staff of animal health and husbandary divisions has conoentrated their
efforts to improvo animal husbandarypto distribute the improved breod of
friesian dairy oowat to improve bee keeping and in paurtIcular on me.uv.rou
to improve health of livestock.



* 1   nil Production
The working prograe of the animal productios diviaion hem lately been
generally iLtepgrated with that of the extenaion service apart from acm
own peculiarities. The prograime includea viaitst meetinga, extendiAn
advises for cattle manaagaement housings fodder production, bee keeping
and raiaing freiaian cows and poultry in addition to time consuming inm
vestmeat studies and providin concentrato feed fromr SMP fied mill in
stalled in 1984 (Annex 6)'. The acbieved activities of the animal produo-

Tbb has huge program3es of vaccination to prevent the spread of infectious
diseases in addition to their almost daily response to farmers requests for
treatment of their stocks against parasites or other health endanger cwsseu
In addition to the main centres of veterinary servicee, capaipgs were wag-
ed periodically aga$nst contagious and epidemio diseases. The services ban
extended the activities far beyond the SURDP II area and therefore covering
* great pert of Taiz and rbb Governorates. The vaccinations of cattle and
goats and sheep during the project period has reached 445113 heads (Table 5.6)
whereas treatments of both external and interna parasites and ochar cases
have totalled 2L3059 cases (Thble 5.6)
Quarantine aervice of S5UDP II is available to Dubab an6 Xasea as sea
outlets to the project area. They are pDOr and unequipped and unfortunately
do not control all inlets, Iherefore the '?F dod.udL to coi Act a nodurn

quantities of fertilizers (ahout 4000 tons) are available in 1986, asd
the pivate aector is playing an increasing role in secaring fertilisers*
The project area conwanes a lot of fertilizers (eotiated by the private
sector to be 50% of all YAR). Irrespective of the rise of fertilizere
use, it is still uwtafficient and unfortunately unbalane4t* Doe to the

unbalanced fertilizers. Although$ the increasing use of oreanic fertilizers

VI, FROJET MMITS$
In addition to benefits mntioned in the impaat section, the incroee
in crop production is conosdered to be the main benofit of the projeot
which could be quantified, unlike oth6r components.
A   Qoot of Outmio and lnmzt
Tno *atite the not value of crop production  w,zrve     wo arried
out in 1985/1987 to evaluate the iMuts and the laboun use 8n 11P
II covered area an their cost compared to now areae unre ased yet
by extonsion activities. The with projeat impuo, traction nd labour
requ3irement per heatare is presented in Tablo 6.1 where"s the farm
input cost per haotare ( 87 season) is shown ii Table 6.2. The
corresponding values of tbe "without project area" we roporW   in
Tables 63 and 6.4.
5he "with projeat area" uses generafly more inputs and consequently
input cost per hectare is higher than the "without project area".
In addition, crop yields are much higher in the with project coomp-
red to the without project area 7his results in higher oout of
threshing for the with project area since tbreahing is ainoD
isted with crop yield. Somewhat similar values were reported in the
preparation report of the Southern Region Agricultural Development
Projeot (SRDA).- So3e deviations oacUrred but the vst.r coot pre
seated here wma adopted from SUAN? preparation report.
The financial (and the economic) prices of farm inuts arA outputs
are shown in Table 6.5. the prios wore essentially those adopted
by the SRADP preparation mission of February 1986 apart from minor
differemnsc
3. Incremental Croo Productigj,
The benefits from the incremental crop production have been outstoa-
ding. The comparison of the area unler extension services of SURDP
S (Table 6.6) with similar crop area outside the project activities
(Table 6.7) for the 1985/1986 season showed great differences in
yield per heotare, production obtained and the net production values
of different crops. The net value of crop productton in the with
project out valued the without project by a aum of about 359 million
W2U at the 1987 faragate financial prie

bhea the farmer used the appropriate agricultural practices and inputs,
yield was 'eatly =ncroaaed to the eatent that the valeLs of the availo-
able outputs for sale(after deducting the land lord's shaso ana the faa>
ily conasumption) were greater than the total production cost. his trend.
has to be encourged#. aitaough some tenants may hesitate iz the beginning
especially if they faced a low yielding seaaon.
The Farm Model B shows     how the farmer is clever in using his owned
0.5 heotare which in stream irrigated in maizse vegetable and citrua
production. The appraised estimates assumed. that the farmar obtains neg-
ative oash balance in years 3 aol 4(Table 6.10.)*  This was not realised
in the actual obtained model due to the efficient use of the irrigated
area particularly in vegetable production that was also intercropped, uz.
der oitrua for the first 3 yeard6
Adopting the same principal used in the previous farm model it is esti-
mated that appraised income will be 200% with present crop values (sorghnm,
maiz4e vegetables a-d citrus). Irrespootive of this the present inoome of
Farm Model B is eastated to be about 6 times (rear 1 ), 4 times (year 5),
5 times (eew 10) ant 8 folds (year 14 and afterarda.s) when cbmpared. to
the appraised incomeo The ohig incomo increase is due mainly to the hibX
prices of fruits achieved following the ban of frtit importation.
Farm model C (Tables 6*11a, 6.11b) waa unique when comparing appraised
MAn  actually obtained net income values. If the appraised cash balanc
values are revised into 150%,actual cash balaneo will reach this revised
estimates only in year 10. Before that actual income was about 75% of re-
Visod appraised in year one ad. about 80% in year 5. Porhaps the farmers
oAuld have mide more income if they uould have increased the area under
Potato cultivation, but the crop rotation they adopted here is better ror
thair land anl production in the long znn
The Farm Model D (comorcial bioilar farm) has been deleted in the addendum
of the project file. It has been worked out because poultry production, is
progressively becoming a good scource of income to farmer in the project
area and         CACB in offering credit for this activity whioh baas eapm.
ded to the extent that frosze imported chicken are no more available in
the market becauae of availability of locally produced chicken  The oo-
Prison between the appraised nd the actually obtained incomes (Tables
6.12 a, 6.12b) indicated that farmer actual income is relatively high (118%
in first year),(350% in year 5) and (about 150% from Year 15 and alteorwards)e
Sho chicken price of both appraised and actual weights is essetially the
amo.

In the appraisal report 7rw. model P assumed that farmers will ruais
a herd of 3 adult cove plus two heifers w'ith the improvement of howsing
feedinc.eto.
Unfortunately thio model has not boen fully realised. Among other fact-
ora behinid thiu arol  uhort.-e of feed accnmaranied with rclativoly hiji1
prices; hi,-h prices of meat particularly calve meat and hiAh prices of
milk that encourage the oale of younzj born oneo instead of rearing theq
infSequent occurrer.ce of milk sales or products in all aroa9, failur* to
convince farmera ... eto (Annez 6).
For the actual obtained model, the pilot proerame of 8URDP TT for diotrlw
bution of the improved friesian bzeed of am was utilisedo Following
actualitiea and aaauamtions were adopteds
t. The farmer will not rear more than two friesian mikin aOws.
2. Replacement in made from the offspring.
3. Unwanted offspring will be sold (females) or slaughtered (males) at
3 months age to save feed as covmonly practiced.
4. Mother cown will be iold after 9 years of production*
5. The farmer as a prequisite to obtention of the ori;,-inal mother cow
through loan will grow about 0.2 ha of alfalfa to foed his herds.
69 The farmer will provide green fodder (alfalfa) ani cereal utover (or
straw) to supplenent needed feede  The cost of all'*lfa produotion
(about 1000 iRL),stover an  straw used from his farm will be compen-
sated IW the value of the orumio m ew3ra that he adgs tc the soil of                K
his farm to raice crop yields. but the farmers payo for the cost of
the ooncentrate feed that he obtains frow the feed mill of SURDP II.
7. The farmer constructs a very simple shade for each  roan cow (a pr..
requisite to obtain the loan).
8. Labour is done by the family mainly by women and chilAren.
9 SURDP II offered free veterinary services and medication upto year
1985 only.
In* CACB debt services are the same terms used (medium term loan of 6000
IRL at 10% interest for 4 years with one year grace)o
11. Values of the preprojeot year is used from the appraial report.

sd, tbrougk  1987, the policy adopted by the project was to post !esoi
gaduates of agrioulture as block ceatre in-charge in order to oupPert
the extension activities bt the block centres after the departure of

The tarwet for home ecoaie offices and extenscnts was not fully
aheve. (Table 7.4b).  Beese  of the local oonditiona, th  nature of
the work and the ealary table, it was not easy to attract or subsequezm
t2y rot ain the employed girls. Moro attractive epportunities were founl
elaewhe. Therefore the project adopted in 1985 the poliay of employ-
ing village girls, rather tban Cirla from This and Ibb cities. These
girls wero recomrended by the LCCD to the project as a prswrequisite of
extendig SURDP activity to their areas. Despite difficultiesa a reasm

In addition to the infomnl contact between SURM? staff and the
nei^boAMing ARA staff, more formal relationship occurred and the
linkage betwen Su    and ARA has been otrengthened tollowig the
arrival of SURDP senior agricultural advioor in 1984  Late that
year SUM)? apointed liaison officer who was posted at ARA hSA

Sose new varieties of crops are available to farmeres Sonalik
and Narob wheat, Tihama and Dthomaltar (Tat: 1) maize, International
cmpound millet. Other varietios are claimed by ARA to be urder
mutiplication. The local stocks of aorghun are still preferred
by the fanmers because of their high yield of stover used an feed.
AA improved atsain of local sorghvm  (Oadasi) is under multiplies-
tioa.
A number of vegetable varieties has also been recoended for ixrli-
gated areas. The extension still need specific reaiwendaticn
packages in the fields of rainfed agriculture, crop rotations pro.
duetion of fruits, water use, animal husbaundary... eta
In April 1986, a workshop wan held in Tadz (SUMP initiative) to
discuss food se@witY  in Yemen. In July 1986, metings wer held
at ARA to discus reoarch priorities for the next five year.
SUM)? and ARA have reached caommn agreement with respect to re-
search priorities for the Souther Uplands area.
2.  Seed Production Project (SPP)
The SPP stationed now in Dhanar Governorate has been of great ass-
istance to both ARA (seed multiplication) and SUIMP's extension
work (availability of oertified seeds). SPP supplied maize, wheat
and millet seeds required by the ertension cervices and is currently
multiplying newly recanded seeds of cereals. The availability
of improved seeds at time and place needed in the quality roeo
dad with reasonable prioes should greatly increase the effectiveness

oration of SUMIP and SPPC  nd the satisfactory operation of privat   d
cox-oporative agents particularly in Zbb nd Qsia areas potato grwing
is satisfactorily epanding in the projeot area. Untortunately the
breakdown of the SPPC cooling equipment In 1982 recated in lack of
potato seeds during 1983. lhs evergwAM demand romn farmer. to potato

realised because of Internal constraints at IMll.
6. Veterinary Services and Plant Protection ProJects

needed for projeot activity.
7. Local Councila for Cooperative Dsvslomen!t (LCCD)
To cope with the rural needs.,groups of villages establisb Villago Develo-
pent Cormittees (VDC). tbe VDC*s elect delegates to ropresent them at

2. Shortage of certain agricultural inputs particularly mineral forM

2. Inflation and extencion of the project resulted in the inadequacy of
original allocations of certain categories. The reallocation and use
of unallocated funds between the projeat categories that was agreed

2. The recovery rate of the loans is 77%. in view of the measures and
procedures of getting a loan and the fact that only 4468 selected
individuals have been benefiting from the loans of about YRL 112
millionq the recovery rate s4y not be considered a high one.

AUl the works carried out by the project have been beneficial to the
p4ople and the enwironsent. A small portion of the afforestation seed-
lings were used in afforestation, howeverg mar' were used as ornamentals
na in land acaping. Afforestation is hampered in the area due to lack
of intereat of the private sector who own hills, mountains  .. eto. It
in expected that this attitude mce change in future due to shortage
of forage crops and firewoods anl the increas  of their prices.

The targets set for phase II of the Southern Uplands Rural Developent
Project has been achieved at 100 - 400%.
There has been many benefits of the project but the only quantifiable one
was derived from the increase of crop prcruotion, irrespective of the fact that
sooial and ored.it activities have been alloted the majortiy of the project funds.
This indicates that the extension services has provided economically viable
project irrespective of the unquantifiable targets and in presence of shortagO
of inputs.
The spread, of irrigation, the intensive cropping, the trend of growing more
vegetables, fruits and potatoes and ueing improved varitioo bred vnde hi4h fer-
tilization conditions necessiates that measures should be taken to assure the
availability of fertilizers (and other inputs) with the needed quantity and quo
lity.
The project has been a great success and covered 50% of the aericulturaly
potential area of the Southern Uplands. It is fortunate that it will be followed
by the Southern Regimal Agricultural Development Project in order to continue
and extend the work of 9URDP 1I to cover all the area.
The projeot will have an internal rate of return of 26% in its 20 years
life. Threfore the extension services needs to be contimcualdy strengthened,
a task which will be oarried over thuough SUXD.

HOR'CULE AND MNURSMI
2he Warusan (This) andA Ibb (Ibb) aursaries operated by SUUP stf ar
U80t for propoqation of fruitt coffeerafforestatioa  and  cnamaetl
plants. Coffee is propagated maly at Warasn whreas strwberr7y is
esclusively propated at lbb. Both  a4rserias produce citru  aad affonm.
euation seedlingu.
Warazau -urory is about 4.0 hootwer including about 5000 a2 shaded
area whereas Ibb nurserr covers about 14.0 heotares including about
4000 u shaded are". other trees of different fruits are growing in
the nurseriea for Ale obtention of buda for grmfting. A rigid contrx-
lled syatem of prop-avtion is followed to assure the production of oe.
pletely pest-free seedlingo of high quality varieties.
Number of seedlings produced from differeat crope during the project
period is presented in Table 1.  It represents a signfitcant contribm,
tion of the project to the farmers not only in the project area but iLso
in other areas am well.
Mea bea on fruit importation persuadied .az' fauers to erow fruit treas.
Howevr,t fruit production is not an eaq' technology partioularly
.      . ora farmer who get uedl to aew traditional cereal crops. On
one hand a farse neede to "know" the orop and to be trained to grov
the plants properly and to carry over agricultural practices and tech-
niques as perfectly as hould be. On the other hoed a farser need to
supply his fa-ilies with fruits for ow  consumption because of the ban
of fruita importation.  Thereforo it is not surprising that the m&Jori%y
of farmer. were a -ing the ontension agante (or direotly through the
museries) to support them with "few number" of fruit seedlings (Table
2). It is also observed frequently that a farmer grows close to his
house in a -mall irrigated area few individual trees from different crops
iV.e coffee5 banna, citrus, guava ... etcG  The Yemeni family in a coup-
plow one where one frequently observes 2 - 3 geunertions living together
and consequently family consumption has to be onosidered an important
factor to be dealt with (tie frequency in colum 1, Tible 2 msy be consiu-
dered a modest eatimare for family consumption in most of the crops).
The project eztinsion divisions are doing their best in cooperation with
the horticultural specialists to train farmers on different aspecta of
fruit production using different means includiAg the growing of pilot
ercher"n at farmers fieldas which has reachod a number of 157 orcharts
upto June 1986 (392% of appraised numbers). It is therefore anticip;ced
as o0e starts to observe recently in the projeat area that the trend
of fruit production  ia ahifting      to a patters of commercial one rather
than for family consumption.

TS aonuma about 500,000 tons of whet eM flour yearly and prdnoe
about 15% laoally. Wheat is grown on about 5% of the cultivated area and
t not attractive to farmes because of its relativly low  incom value whe
compared to other crops grown in high rainfall or brigate& area.
To reach aelf  ffioienoy in wheat production, YAR has to increase oul-
tivated area, of wheat upto about 175,000 hectaremeanwhle measures has to be
taken to raise wheat yield uPo 3 tons per hectares Tis needs the cooperation
of famwar and the atmaio  and the availability of different agricultural

RE: YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC: SOUTHERN UPLANDS REGIONAL DEN P(CR 1067YAR
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT (PCR)
THIS IS TO ACK RCPT OF YR LTC DT 31/10/09 ON THE ABOVE REF
ATtACHED UITH PROJECT COMPLETION REPOR1(PCR). OUR VIEU AND COMMENTS
ARE 8ELOU AS REOUIRED.
A.     THE PROJECT DID LULE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PHYSICAL
NEEDS OF THE PROJECT SUCH AS CONSTRUCTIONS&RURAL UATER SCHENES*
IEH5CLES FOR SERVICES AND EaUIPMENT FOR AGRICULTURAL NECRANISATION
AND ITS OTHER ACTIVITIES,EUEN EXCEEDING ITS PLANNED BUDGETS.
HOLEUER THE IMPACT ON HUMNM RESOURCES DEUP uAS INSUFFICIENT SUCH
AS TRAINING OF SMS.EXT ASTS AND RESEARCH/EXT (R/E) LINKAGE.
THE LOCAL STAFF UMERE LACKING SUFFICIENT KNOULEVSE.THE NUMBER OF SMS
MERE INADEQUATE TO BACK UP THE EXTS ASTS AND POOR LINKAGE UITH
RESEARCH UHICH LEAD TO INADEOUATE FEED BACK-KNOU HUW.
B.     UITH THE RESULTS OF ThE AMOE. A NWHBER OF EXTS CENTRES
REMAINED INOPERATIVE DURING PAHSING OUT OF SURDP II TILL THE
BEGINNINB OF SRADP.
C.     THE ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN (PCR) ESTIMATB BY IDA IS
REASONABLE (I E) 16PCT AS THE PCR STATEMENT IS RATHER EXAGGERATED.
D.     REGARDING CROPS YIELD MENTIONED IN TABLE 5.1 PAGE 30 SHOUN
IN PCR SEEMS TO BE ON HISHER SIDE, THEREFORE THE APPRAISAL FIGS
OF UORLD AVERAGE CAN BE TAKEN AS REASONABLE. EVEN THIS 19 BASED ON
MODEL FARMS UNICH CANNOT BE GENERALISED OVER THE ENTIRE AREA OF
THE PROJECT, BECAUSE THE CLIMATOLOGICAL FACTORS AND RAIN FALL VARY
FROn PLAVE TO PLACE AND YEAR TO YEAR. ANY EXPERIMENTAL ERROR UILL
ALSO BE MULTIPLIED BY A NWIBER OF TIMES UNDER FARMERS PRODUCTION
ALONG UTTH CLIMATOLOGICAL FACTORS UHICH IS A VARIABLE DEPENDING
ON THE TIME AND PLACE. THOUGH THERE IS A NOTABLE INCREASE IN THE
CROP YIELDS DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IRRIGATION SCHEMES AND
OTHER EXOGENOUS FACTORS, BUT THE INCREASE IS NOT AS EXPECTED IN
RAI1WED AREAS AND CANNOT REACH 60 PCT (PCR)
E.     PHYSICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT STILL RESTS UITH THE
EXPATRIATE STAFFS, BECAUSE MOST OF THE TRAINED STAFF ARE NO
LONGER CONTINUING IN THE PROJECT.
F.     THE TECHNICAL GUIDANCE FOR RUS IS TO BE CONFIRED BY THE
FOLLOU UP PROJECT.
G.     SUMMING UP THE ABOVE PAST EXPERIENCE, IT IS EVIDENT THAT
IT NEEDS EFFORT, GUTS, MOBILIZATION AND TIME NOT ONLY SUSTAIN THIS
ON GOING PROJECT BUT ALSO TO COMPLETE, REHABILITATE, OPERATE ANID
MAINTAIN THE GOALS ACHIEVED DURING SURDF I AND II AND TO EFFECTIVELY
MANAGE AND BETTER LINK RESEARCH AND EXTNS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE
END USERS AND RURAL DEVP OF THE SOUTHERN UPLANDS OF YAR AS UELL AS
