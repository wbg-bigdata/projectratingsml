INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR THE
MADHYA PRADESH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed credit
in an amount equivalent to US$33 million for the Madhya Pradesh Agricultural
Credit project. This project has as its objective the provision of medium to
long-term credit to farmers in that State for on-farm investment in minor
irrigation and land levelling as a means of increasing agricultural produc-
tion and furthering the adoption of new production techniques.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The economy of India is dealt with in paragraphs 2-11 of the
President's Report, of the same date on a proposed development credit to
India for an Agricultural Credit Project in Uttar Pradesh State, (No. 107a-IN).
A Country Data Sheet is attached in Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
3.        The proposed credit would be IDA's 52nd operation in India, bringing
the total of IDA funds committed to US$2,233 million. For a review of Bank
Group lending in India, reference is made to paragraphs 12-16 of the
President's Report of the same date on the proposed Uttar Pradesh Agricul-
tural Credit Project. Annex II contains a summary statement of disbursements
as of March 31, 1973, and notes on the status of currently active loans and
credits.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
4.        Reference should be made to paragraphs 17-22 of the President's
Report of the same date on the proposed Uttar Pradesh Agricultural Credit
Project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
5.        The proposed credit finances minor irrigation (dugwells only) and
related land-levelling in Madhya Pradesh. The project was appraised in April
and November 1972. The Appraisal report (104a-IN) is being distributed
separately. Negotiations were held in April 1973. The Borrower was re-
presented by Mr. M.A. Quraishi, Secretary of Cooperatives, Ministry of
Agriculture and Mr. V.N. Rajagupalan, Deputy Secretary, Department of Economic

Affairs, Ministry of Finance. The Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC)
was represented by its Managing Director, Mr. Chidambram, and the State of
Madhya Pradesh by Mr. S.R. Sharma, Special Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture.
The Madha Pradesh State Cooperative Larnd Development Bank (LDB) was represented
by its Chairman, Mr. T.C. Agarwal and the State Directorate of Ttibewells and
Groundwater Surveys (DTGS) by its Director, Mr. G.G. Puri. A project summary
is attached as Annex III.
6.        Madhya Pradesh, the largest State in area in India, with a population
of 42 million, suffers from high population density since almost 60 percent
of its land area is not under cultivation, being mainly forest.    Small farms
and poor farmers predominate.   Compared with other major States, it is rela-
tively backward and heavily dependent on the agricultural sector both for its
output and for the employment of its population. ToD accelerate the pace of
agricultural development aimed principally at expanding foodgrain production
and providing employment for a growing labor force, the Government of Madhya
Pradesh is giving high priority to the introduction of high-yielding varieties
and fertilizers and, because extensive areas continue to depend on uncertain
rainfall and are subject to periodic drought, the installation of wells.    The
groundwater resources in Madhya Pradesh are generally adequate to sustain
further irrigation development but, because miuch of the project area is
crystalline hard rock, control of groundwater use is needed to prevent over-
investment and overexploitation.
7.        The project would support a three-year lending program of LDB and
qualified coimmercial bankcs. The investments would comprise construction of
about 25,000 new dugwells, improvement of 15,000 existing dugwells and the
installation of about 29,000 electric and 12,000 diesel powered pumpsets and
about 2,700 Persian wheels. Shortages and unreliability of electricity
supplies in the State make it necessary to finance diesel as well as electric
operated pumpsets.   Because the terrain in the project area is not uniformly
level, some related land development of about 30.000 ha to enable water from
the wells to be constructed to be used will be necessary and is included in
the proposed financing. About 70 pneumatic boring drills to be financed from
sources other than the proceeds of the credit will be procured by the State
of Madhya Pradesh to meet the incremental needs of the program.
8.        The total project cost is estimated at US$60.3 million, of which the
proposed credit would finance US$33 million. The Association's credit would
cover the foreign exchange cost estimated at US$2.9 mil'lion or 5 percent of
project cost and 53 percent of iocal currency costs. Of the total project
costs, IDA would finance about 55 percent; farmers 12 percent; and LDB,
participating commercial banks, and ARC, 33 percent.
9.        The proceeds of the credit would be relent by GOI to ARC, which
would repay about 50 percent at thze end of nine years at an interest rate of
5-1/4 percent ana the balance at the end of 15 years at an interest rate of
5-3/4 percent per annum. The ARC would supervise and refinance at 6-1/2 per-
cent per annum the loan operations of LDB and participating commercial banks.
Loans to individual borrowers would Dear interest at a minimum of 9 percent



- 3 -
per annum and would be repayable over periods of up to nine years, but
extending to 15 years in the case of loans to small farmers. Farmers'
contributions would range from 20 percent to 10 percent of the cost of
individual investments. In the case of loans made by LDB, the farmers'
contribution would include their obligatory share capital contribution of 5
percent of the loan amount.
10.       ARC is a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India and a familiar
lending channel for IDA lending to the agricultural sector in India. It
is a sound financial institution with experienced, qualified staff and has
demonstrated its capabilities in supervising schemes it refinances. Like
other states, Madhya Pradesh has an established banking network which, for
long-term investments, is LDB and the commercial banks.
11.       Partly because of the size of Madhya Pradesh, LDB is less developed
than similar institutions in other States and lacks sufficient primary banks
in its federal structure to achieve effective rural penetration. It is
handicapped by a relatively low turnover and a high level of arrears. To
meet these deficiencies and make full use of existing facilities, the State
Government and the banks prepared a banking plan for the project, which was
agreed during negotiations. This plan includes a program for the opening
of branch offices of commercial banks strengthened staffing arrangements and
assistance to the commercial banks by various agencies of the Government;
involvement of District and State level coordinating committees and the
financial and managerial improvement of LDB. To the extent that overdues of
the Primary banks of the LDB in the project area exceed 25 percent at any
time during the life of the project the State Government will provide the LDB
system with new capital to match the write-off of chronic overdues. With
these conditions, the banks in the project area would be adequate to achieve
full project implementation within the three-year period envisaged.
12.       Individual investments would be appraised by LDB and commercial
bank staff under the general supervision of ARC. (DTGS, which is concerned
with the investigation of groundwater resources, would supervise the applica-
tion of spacing and density criteria to be applied to well construction
in the project area. The Directorate is competent and is being expanded to
meet the requirements of the project. It does, however, require some
technical assistance, which will be provided by the secondment of 5 geohy-
drologists for DTGS from the Central Groundwater Board of GOI.
13.       Under the project, local contractors and government agencies
would carry out the minor irrigation schemes, and the State government's
agriculture department engineering wing and contractors would undertake the
land development. Mainly local materials would be used. Charges are reasonable
and adequate. Pumpsets, including repair and maintenance facilities are
readily available in the State.    In all, about 43,000 individual small
and widely-scattered farm investments would be made, extending over a three
year period and international competition would not, therefore, be feasible.
Procurement would be through normal commercial channels according to farmers'
choice, as for other similar IDA credit projects.



- 4 -
14.       Disbursements by the Association are expected to extend over 3-1/2
years and would be against appropriate statements of LDB and commercial bank
lending for project purposes refinanced by ARC. These disbursements would
average 62 percent of loans disbursed by the lending agencies.
15.       The project would have substantial economic and social benefits.
It would raise agricultural yields and cropping intensity, as well as
increase on-farm employment opportunities in one of the most economically
depressed States in India. The livelihood of about 44,000 farmers (including
a majority of small farmers) and their families would be improved significantly.
Financial returns to farmers, based on prevailing prices, are estimated
to range from 35 percent to 51 percent. The rate of return to the economy,
based on projected world market prices, is estimated to range from 17 percent
to over 100 percent depending on the types of wells and cropping patterns.
The gross, incremental value of annual production in the project area at full
development, calculated at current domestic prices, would increase by US$22
million.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUJTHORITY
16.       The draft Development Credit between India and the Association,
the draft Project Agreement between the Agricultural Refinance Corporation,
the Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Land Development: Bank and the
Association, the draft Agreement between the State of Madhya Pradesh and the
Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V9
Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of the Resolution
approving the proposed Development Credit are being clistributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The draft Development Credit Agreement
includes as a condition of effectiveness the implementation of an agreed
banking plan for the project, including measures for the financial and
managerial rehabilitation of LDB (Section 8.01(d)).
17.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
18.       I recommend that the Executive Directors al?prove the proposed
credlit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Ln No. 307     Indian Iron and Steel Company; US$19.5 million loan of
December 22 , 1961; Closing date: December 31, 1973
This loan was made in 1961 and the original closing date? was January
31 , 1967. The implementation of the project has been affected by technical and
managerial difficulties connected with the opening of new collieries to supply
IISCO's steel plant. The Bank, together with technical consultants, has been
providing constant supervision and progress is being made in resolving the tech-
nical issues. On the managerial side, the Government of India announced on
July 20, 1972, that it was taking over the management of IISCO for two years.
The Government has assured us that this action will not interfere with IISCO's
obligation to the Banik. On March 31, 1973, US$1.7 million remained undisbursed
of which about US$1 million has been earmarked for equipment on order and
technical services, while US$0.7 million may be cancelled by the closing date
of December 1973. The Bank has approved some increase in short-term indebted-
ness as well as a rehabilitation program and has also agreed in principle to a
reduction in the Bank's mortgage cover.
Ln No. 414     Sixth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US-4.3 million loan of May 28, 1965; Closing date:
June 30, 1973
Ln No. 515     Seventh Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$24.b million loan of September 10, 1967; Closing
date; December 31, '973
Ln No. 683     Eighth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$40.0 million loan of June 3, 1970; Closing date;
September 30, 1974
Ln No. 789     Ninth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$50.0 million loan of October 21, 1971; Closing
date: December 31, 1976
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company. There have been delays in
disbursements on the two earliest loans 414-IN and 515-IN as a result of the
business slowdown in the years following 1967. The original closing date of
June 30, 1 970, for 414-IN has been extended three times to June 30, 1973 and
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

that for 515-IN twice, from Decermrber 31, 1971 to December 31, 1973. Loan 683-IN
has been fully committed as of December 3', 1972. Cormitments under Loan 789-IN
are slightly ahead of schedule and disbursemnent substantially ahead of schedule.
Cr No. 89      Beas Equipment; US$23.0 million credit of June 29, 1966: Closing
date: December 31, 1973
The purpose of this credit is to provide part of the foreign ex-
change cost of imported equipment and services required to develop hydro-
electric power from the Beas River, to extend irrigation in the Punjab and
Rajasthan and for associated construction works. The project, which has been
subject to some delays, is part of a larger scheme for the integrated develop-
ment of the eastern rivers of the Indus Basin. The balance of the credit out-
standing is to be spent on items scheduled for delivery- up to December 31, 1973,
and as a result, the original closing date of December 31, 1972, has been
postponed by a year.
Ln No. 614     Tarai Seeds; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969; Closing
date: December 31, 1974
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in
the development of seeds of high yielding varieties of crops. The Bank
has approved plans for the expansion of an existing seed processing plant and
construction of a new plant. Orders have been placed for the equipment re-
quired for the former and tenders for equipping the latter plant are being
readvertised following rejection of earlier bidding as unresponsive. A major
difficulty arose because of a lack of response to tenders for land-levelling.
This problem is being overcome through large scale land levelling demonstrations
under field conditions in the project area following an agreement that contractors
should be permitted to purchase inmported equipment of their choice for land
levelling.
Ln No. 615     Telecommunications III; US$27.5 million loan of June 18, 1969;
Closing date: June 30, '973
The project, wnich was financed 50 percent by a Bank loan and 50
percent by an IDA credit (153--.N),was designed to assist in financing the
telecommunications expansion program for the first three years of the Fourth
Plan period (1969-1972). Credit 153-IN was disbursed fully three months prior
to the closing date, but the closing date for Loan 615-IN has had to be post-
poned from December 31, 1972, to June 30, 1973. Although disbursements have
taken place broadly in line with the original schedule, there have been de-
lays in meeting project targets of about six months for local exchange
installations and up to two years for some long distance-works, resulting from
difficulties experienced by local factories and foreign delivery delays of some
key items. In recent months the situation has improved, especially at the
local factories.

Cr No. 176     Kadana ]Irriation; US$3.0 million credit of February 9, 1970;
Closing date: September 30, 1976
This project will finance in part the construction of Kadana Dam
on the Mahi River, the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam, and the
resettlement of inhabitants in the reservoir area in the States of Gujarat and
Rajasthan. The project also includes canalization, land levelling, the con-
struction- of field channels, drainage works and roads, and a program to
support agricultural development.  The project is likely to be completed about
two years behind schedule. A major problem has been the failure of the prime
contractor on the dam itself; the Government was forced to discharge his con-
tractor in October 1971 and to undertake the work by departmental force
account. Since that time the Public Works Department has been making satis-
factory progress. Drainage works in the right bank area are likely to be
more extensive and more costly than expected and may not be completed until
1978. The outlook for other components of the project remains satisfactory.
As the delays in implementation have occurred at the start of the project, and
also before major investments had been made, both investment costs and benefits
will be deferred. Thus the effect of these delays upon the economic rate of
return is not likely to be significant.
Cr No. 191     Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project; US$15.0 million credit of
June 3, 1970; Closing date: June 30, 1974
Cr No. 203     Punjab Agricultural Credit Project; US$27.5 million credit of
June 24, 1970; Closing date: December 3 i, 1973
Cr No. 226     Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Credit Project; US$24.4 million
credit of Januar   , 1971; Closing date: June 30, 1974
Cr No. 249     Haryana Agricultural Credit Project; US$25.0 million credit of
June 11, 1971; Closing date: March 31, 1975
Cr No. 250     Tamil Nadu Agricultural Credit Project; US$35.0 million credit
of June 11, 1971; Closing date: December 31, 1974
Cr No. 278     Mysore Agricultural Credit Projects US$40.0 million credit of
January 7, 1972; Closing date: October 31, 1975
Cr No. 293     Maharashtra Agricultural Credit Project; US$30.0 million credit
March 29, 1972; Closing date: December 31, 1975
All seven agricultural credit projects, which total US$216.9 million,
are now effective. Except for the Punjab project, which consists of mechanization
equipment, all are similar in structure, being designed to provide long- and
medium-term credit to farmers through credit institutions for such on-farm
investments as tractors, minor irrigation and land-levelling.   Implementation
and disbursement have been slower than was originally expected, mainly due to
delays in the institutional reforms required under the projects (hiring of
groundwater experts, changes in lending criteria and terms,etc.). These con-
straints have now been overcome and the rate of disbursement is accelerating.
A recent mission has made recommendations to GOI to further improve project

performance. By March 31, 1973, US$26.8 million out of US$35 million had been
disbursed -- under the first to be approved, the Gujarat project. In all
us$54.3 had been disbursed by March 31, 1973.
The only major problem which remains unsolved is the procurement
of tractors (which account for almost 30 percent of the credits).  The im-
position by the Government of India of a 40 percent import duty and the
realignment of the rates of exchange of international currencies contributed
to the delays. Difficulties were also experienced in f'inalizing tender doc-
uments. The exchange realignment of 1971 was instrumental in distorting bid
prices to the extent that the Government had to withdraw the Punjab tender
and to re-advertise. Only recently have the fresh bids been evaluated. It
is hoped that prices will shortly be advertised to farmers. Tender invitations
in the case of the other credits are delayed pending the results obtained in
the Panjab case.
Cr No. 230     Agro-Aviation; US$6.0 million credit of January 28, 1971;
Closing date: December 31, 1974
The project was designed to improve facilities for aerial spray-
ing of pesticides, as part of India's plant protection program. So far no
disbursements have taken place because thie Government was considering the
procurement arrangements for the importation of aircraft. The Government has
recently proposed a change in the specifications of the aircraft to be financed
by the credit.
Cr No. 241     Telecommunicati ons IV; US$78.0 million credit of May 3, 1971;
Closing date: December 31, 1974
This project is a continuation of Teleconmiunications III and has
been designed to support the telecommunicatioiis expansian program over the
last two years of the Fourth Flan. (1969-7)4). Procuremeint action for delivery
of imported goods in 1973/74 'has been largely completeo.. Production problems
in local factories delayed ivitial disbursement by about 6-9 months. However,
production has now picked up and as of Apiil 30, 1973, US$11 million had been
disbursed under the credit.  F'ill disbur,ement is expected by the closing date
of December 1974.
Cr No. 2)42    Power Transm-ission TII-'OS$'7'.0 million credit of May 3,1971;
Closing date: September 30, 1975.
This project, a continuation of the project financed by Loan 416-N,
is designed to assist in finamcing the purchase of equipment and materials
required to develop a power transmission program in nine States under the
Fourth Five-Year Plan. IniTial delays occurred because of problems associated
with preparing bid docurnent sultablo for international bidding and the analysis
of the very large number of bids involved, but contract awards have now been
made for much of the major equipm3nt so that more rapid disbursement can be
expected. Disbursements should be completed by thje closing date of September 30,
1975.

Cr No. 264     Cochin Fertilizer;  US$20.0 million credit of July 30, 1971;
Closing date: June 30, 1975
This project is intended to help finance the expansion of
fertilizer manufacturing facilities at Cochin. After initial delays, the
project is now proceeding about six months behind schedule. However,res-
ponse to tenders has been disappointing and procurement difficulties and
labor problems could lead to additional delays.
Cr No. 267     Wheat Storage; US$5.0 million credit of August 23, 1971
Closing date: September 30, 1975
This credit, which will provide storage facilities in India's
wheat belt, was declared effective on November 14, 1972.
Cr No. 268     Pochampad Irrigation; US$39.0 million credit of August 23, 197 1;
Closing date: March 31, 1977
This project comprises the construction of a dam on the Godavari
River, a concrete-lined main canal, an irrigation distribution system to serve
100,000 ha, agricultural support services and the construction of village
roads. With the exception of the lining of the main canal, the project civil
engineering works are generally proceeding satisfactorily, and disbursements
are ahead of schedule. Bids for two canal-lining contracts, opened in March
1972, were unreasonably high, and the Association and the State Government of
Andha Pradesh agreed that one of the contracts should be retendered. New bids have
now been received and are being evaluated by the Government of Andhra Pradesh.
The program for agricultural development, which has been falling behind schedule,
is receiving close attention by the State Governrnent, with assistance and advice
from the Government of India and IDA review missions.
Cr No. 279     Gorakhpur Fertilizer; US$10.0 million credit of January 7, 1972;
Closing date: March 31, 1975
The engineering design for this project, for the expansion of an
urea plant in Uttar Pradesh, is now well advanced and equipment estimated to
cost about US$4.0 million has been ordered. Although delivery of some
equipment may take longer than forecast during appraisal, the project is pro-
gressing without serious difficulties.
Cr No. 280     Railways XI; US$75.0 million credit of January 24, 1972
Closing date: September 30, 1974
This project, consisting of new and ongoing works in the Indian
Railways investment program for three years beginning April 1, 1971, is pro-
gressing in a satisfactory manner. Disbursements are ahead of schedule.
Cr No. 294     Bihar Agricultural Markets; US$14.0 million credit of March 29,
1972; Closing date: December 31, 1978
This credit, which will help to finance the establishment of
wholesale markets in about 50 towns, was declared effective on July 31, 1972.
A supervision mission has recently visited the project and has reported very
good progress in the selection, design and appraisal of individual market
sub-projects. Disbursements are expected to begin within the next few months,
ahead of schedule.
