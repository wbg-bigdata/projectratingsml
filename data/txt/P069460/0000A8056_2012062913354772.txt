                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. This ISR update is based on a desk review and phone consultations with the counterparts to comply with the Regional requirement of not exceeding 6 months between two
                         consecutive ISRs. A supervision mission is scheduled for the second half of June 2012, and will provide an opportunity for a comprehensive update of the ISR, including ratings
                         based on actual progress. The last full supervision took place in June 2011; meanwhile, a partial implementation support visit was conducted in November 2011, and March 2012

                         2. The project is in its seventh year of implementation. Key progress and results already achieved on the ground as of last June 2011 include: (a) establishment of a functioning
                         institutional foundation for the integrated and participatory management of biodiversity in the Gulf of Gabes (with 4 national institutions collaborating closely and 5 local development

                         committees established and operational in the project area), (b) improvement of the scientific knowledge about the various component of the terrestrial, marine and coastal
                         biodiversity of the area through the many studies already completed or underway, (c) promotion of awareness, capacity building and training of key stakeholders involved at all levels
                         (national, regional and local), and (d) 4 management plans prepared already for 4 pilot sites with the last one (Gabes Oasis) under preparation.

                         3. In terms of promotion and outreach to ensure the sustainability of project results already achieved, undertaken initiatives include: (a) application process underway for the
                         inscription of the Gabes Oasis on the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites (on the indicative list since 2008 as a result of the project); (b) designation of the project pilot site northeast
                         of the Kerkennah Islands as marine protected area in line with the implementation of the 2009 law on marine and coastal protected areas; (c) agreement signed between Tunisia and
                         Italy for the environmental protection and support to national policies on climate change, with a component specific to marine protection (3.5 million euro budget out of a total 9.5
                         million euro grant), including the establishment of a management unit for the marine protected area northeast of the Kerkennah Islands and the implementation of certain activities in
                         the Kerkennah management plan (0.9 million euro); and (d) interest from the AfD to possibly finance the implementation of priority actions in the Kerkennah and Kneiss management
                         plans.

                         4. However, preliminary indications points there was implementation progress under components 1 and 2, but also further delays in initiating or completing activities under
                         components 3 and 4 since the last supervision mission of June 2011. These progresses include the completion of a number of ongoing studies and associated contracts, the
                         advancement of procurement processes for certain activities to be initiated, as well as promotion and outreach initiatives to ensure the sustainability of project achievements. Key
                         activities that are still pending or experiencing additional delays include: (a) the initiation of works associated with the installation of artificial reefs and anti-trawling blocks in an
                         experimental site south of the Kerkennah Islands and the construction of the visitors center of Boughara; (b) the materialization of the participatory approach; and (c) the finalization of
                         the studies on hydrodynamics and water quality.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. Keeping in the mind the approaching project closing date, the following actions were agreed upon back in June 2011 in terms of ensuring the sustainability of project
                         achievements: (a) preparing an action plan for the implementation of main project recommendations; and (b) establishing an internal committee to ensure a proper summarization
                         project achievements and identify a communication strategy on project results, with a view to facilitating their integration within regular sector development plans.

                         2. Given the proximity of the project closing date and the lengthy procurement processes, the need for more frequent updates and a strict compliance with the updated project
                         implementation schedule, an enhanced coordination among implementing entities, and close monitoring and supervision is to be highlighted. These points are increasingly critical to
                         ensure that the project achieves its stated development objectives and expected results in a satisfactory manner before its closing date.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
