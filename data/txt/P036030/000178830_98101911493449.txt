MAURITIUS
BIODIVERSITY RESTORATION PROJECT
Country Economic Background and Environmental Context
1.    Mauritius is one of the Third World's economic success stories.  Led by a
burgeoning export-based industrial sector, the country transformed itself within two
decades from a sugar-dependent economy with a per capita income of US$400 to a
middle-income country with a per capita income of about US$3,000, an annual average
increase of 9.6% in current dollar terms. However, the economic activities associated
with human occupation in the last few centuries have taken a significant cumulative toll on
the nation's biodiversity.
2.    Small oceanic islands such as the Mascarenes (of which Mauritius is a part) present
special challenges for the conservation of biodiversity because they are often characterized
by extensive habitat degradation and high rates of species extinction. The Mascarenes
encompass a number of islands in the Western Indian Ocean, including the largest islands
of Mauritius and Rodrigues, and numerous remote and smaller islands. Their diverse
climatic, geological and topographical regimes have resulted in the evolution of diverse
biota with a high degree of endemism, further promoted by the islands' age and isolation.
3.    With the exception of some of the more remote oceanic islands, Mauritian
ecosystems were profoundly modified and degraded after the uninhabited Mascarenes
were discovered and colonized. A period of lumber (ebony) extraction in the seventeenth
century was followed by agricultural development for sugar cane. As a result, only
relictual areas of original habitat survive. With this habitat loss has come a series of
extinctions, most notably of the endemic flightless avifauna, among others of the dodo
and the solitaire, and of reptile species like giant tortoises. The loss of species and
populations has been caused by out-competition and predation by invasive exotic species
(plants as well as animals), uncontrolled exploitation and the inherent genetic/demographic
vulnerability of small populations. Even if all remnant habitat areas were protected,
species and habitat loss would continue because of the continuing influence of exotic
species and the poor demographic security of small populations.
4.    Now that the major period of historical habitat loss has passed, the surviving
remnants of the biota offer an opportunity for the restoration of largely destroyed, pre-
colonial ecosystems, and in particular for their associated endangered species. The islands
of Rodrigues, Round Island, and Ile aux Aigrettes offer differing but complimentary
opportunities for habitat restoration and species recovery.



2
5.    The biodiversity of Mauritius. Despite these historical pressures, Mauritius and
its dependency of Rodrigues are still globally recognized as centers of endemism for
vascular plants, birds, reptiles and mollusks. Between 800 and 900 plant species occur on
Mauritius, including eight endemic genera. About 300 species are endemic to Mauritius,
of these approximately 80%  are threatened.  The flora of Rodrigues counts 145
indigenous species, of which 41 are endemic. A large proportion of the threatened plant
species survive as tiny relictual populations that possess a very high probability of
imminent extinction. The floristic inventory has yet to be completed.
6.    Rodrigues Island. Recognized since the nineteenth century as one of the world's
most degraded tropical islands, Rodrigues has 45 endemic species. The majority of these
are critically threatened, seven of which now survive with fewer than 10 wild individuals.
The island Forestry Service, with support from World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
volunteers, has been running a successful propagation and reintroduction program.
However, the long term success of this work is seriously compromised by poor facilities
and a lack of professional training in horticulture, applied conservation biology, project
planning and monitoring. Without additional resources, a number of critically endangered
species are likely to become extinct or have their chances for long term conservation
reduced through poor genetic/demographic management.
7.    Round Island. Round Island is the site for one of the best documented island
restoration efforts. It represents the largest area in the Mascarenes free of introduced
animals and contains the last remnants of the palm savannah once characteristic of
northern Mauritius. Drawing on expertise in restoration ecology of both Mauritius and
New Zealand, the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust (JWPT) and the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Natural Resources (MOA) prepared a management plan for the
restoration of Round Island. Following the successful removal of feral animals (goats and
rabbits) and ongoing efforts to eradicate exotic plants, the island can now be restored and
the original palm savannah and hard wood forest re-established. Locally extinct animals
can be reintroduced. Because of the widely prevalent threats to endemic species on the
main island of Mauritius, Round Island represents one of the best chances to restore and
maintain endangered Mauritius plant and animal communities.
8.    He aux Aigrettes. Leased by the Mauritius Wildlife Fund (MVWF), this 25 hectare
island contains the last viable area of coastal ebony forest, a type of forest now lost on the
island of Mauritius. Under the direction of MWF, an ambitious habitat restoration
program was initiated which can be developed in parallel to the restoration of Round
Island to restore the coastal forest and palm savannah communities and re-introduce
missing elements of the fauna.
9.    Mauritian Wildlife Fund. The Mauritian Wildlife Fund is a non-governmental
group promoting the integrated management of threatened species in Mauritius. It is
known internationally for innovative approaches to threatened species management, and
most notably for its captive breeding, genetic and demographic studies, reintroduction and
habitat management of the Mauritian kestrel and pink pigeon. For 10 years, it has



3
collaborated closely with the Conservation Unit in the Forestry Department within MOA.
Recently, MOA signed a Memorandum of Understanding, concerning cooperation with a
group of international NGOs and the MWF in matters of biodiversity conservation. The
group has a demonstrated ability to work on the islands and enjoys an excellent working
relationship with GOM and local private sugar estates.
10.   Environmental Strategy and Policy Contexts. The Government of Mauritius
(GOM) has been aware for many years of the considerable environmental issues
confronting the islands, and has reacted by developing a sound body of plans, strategies
and investment programs. Mauritius prepared a National Environmental Action Plan
(NEAP) in 1990, and then approved its Environmental Investment Plan (EIP) to support
the NEAP. The EIP outlines a US$109 million program focusing on: (i) institutional
strengthening to develop the necessary framework of environmental policy and legislation;
(ii) land management and tourism control to ensure the protection of natural resources and
historic architecture; (iii) industrial, sewerage and solid waste pollution to address the
effects of such land-based pollution; (iv) marine conservation to preserve and monitor
marine resources; (v) agricultural residues to control the effects of pesticides and
fertilizers; and (vi) terrestrial conservation to protect and/or restore natural habitats. A
largely IBRD/GOM-financed project, Environmental Monitoring and Development
Project, has been under implementation since 1990. It provides US$20.5 million to pursue
priority actions identified in the EIP, including monitoring marine pollution, water quality
and ecosystem health, improvement of laboratory analysis facilities, land-use and
infrastructural planning, development of a national solid waste management plan, research
on integrated pest management, and the creation of terrestrial and marine parks, including
the Black River Gorges National Park, Mauritius' first national park. This project
provided key input into the government's recently completed Sewerage Master Plan, for
which GOM is seeking financing estimated at US$50 million. The Sewerage Master Plan
would support civil works for land-based pollution control, and institutional strengthening
for a newly established Waste Water Authority. Certain measures to combat marine
pollution are already under preparation, as part of the Port Development and Environment
Protection Project recently approved; this includes a ship oily wastes reception facility and
an oil spills contingency plan.
11.   Biodiversity Strategy and Legal Framework. Mauritius was the first country in
the world to ratify the Biodiversity Convention, and GOM is committed to prepare a
biodiversity conservation strategy, as required by the Convention, to complement the
highest priority actions already identified in its NEAP.  Mauritius also ratified the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Through effective
policies, collaboration with NGOs, bilateral and multilateral agencies, public education and
control of certain forms of pollution, GOM has now largely halted terrestrial habitat
destruction. Its official biodiversity priority is now to extend protection to key habitats
and to restore some of its most unique ecosystems. Consequently, GOM is financing the
establishment of the Black River Gorges National Park, and has reserved two uninhabited
offshore islands, Ile aux Aigrettes and Round Island, for species and habitat restoration



4
efforts, as recommended in the NEAP. It is also beginning a program to monitor marine
pollution and ecosystem health. It is funding the Management of Nature Reserves
initiative; Overseas Development Administration (ODA) has supported surveys of flora
and fauna through the Offshore Islets Initiative and provided recommendations for
conserving biodiversity on the various islands. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, WWF
ran an upland forest restoration and species reintroduction program. The Pilot Phase GEF
project in Mauritius, Ecological Restoration of Highly Degraded and Threatened Native
Forest, managed by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) is preparing to
undertake forest restoration in Black River Gorges National Park.  A European
Union/Indian Ocean Commission funded program for coastal management and plant
conservation may also soon begin activities.
Project Objectives
12.   This project intends to help GOM  to meet some of its outstanding global
obligations, identified in domestic environmental strategies and plans and specified under
the Biodiversity Convention, for which full domestic funding is not forthcoming.
Specifically, it would: (i) protect critically endangered biodiversity of international
importance by restoring degraded small island habitats and propagating and reintroducing
endemic species to these habitats, and (ii) strengthen capacity for the management and
monitoring of biodiversity restoration.
Project Description
13.   The project would support innovative efforts in habitat and species restoration.
Local capacity and facilities would be strengthened to undertake the required horticultural,
monitoring and managerial activities necessary to execute the project and to identify and
execute similar future activities. The project would focus on Rodrigues and Round
Islands and lIe aux Aigrettes, which offer differing but complementary opportunities for
habitat restoration and species recovery that are more promising than on the island of
Mauritius. On Rodrigues, it is proposed to develop the existing government nursery at
Solitude, and to expand or consolidate the restoration work underway in three reserve
areas (Grande Montagne, Cascade Mourouk and Anse Quitor) where, amongst other
species, 41 endemic plants and trees (seven of which now survive with less than 10
individuals) would be propagated and transplanted. The restored forest plots would also
play a pivotal role in re-establishing viable populations of two endemic birds, the
Rodrigues fody and the Rodrigues warbler, and the endemic Rodrigues fruit bat. On
Round Island, the first phase of restoration has been completed with the eradication of
feral goats and rabbits. Restoration of the palm savannah and hardwood forest can now
proceed by weeding undesirable exotic species and reintroducing lost species from
Mauritius, some of which have little chance of survival on the mainland because of
competition and predation by introduced species. On Ile aux Aigrettes, the lowland ebony
forest would be restored, while reintroduction of two endemic and endangered bird
species, the Mauritius kestrel and pink pigeon, is in progress. In the long run, this could



5
lead to the reintroduction of other lost ecosystem components (flightless rails, giant
tortoise). A small nursery would be developed on Ile aux Aigrettes to serve its needs and
those of Round Island, with improved accommodation for field workers and researchers.
14.    The project total cost is estimated at US$1.6 million and would consist of four
components:
i.  a survey for (a) the identification of original habitat/community  types for
determining species recovery and habitat restoration targets at the three sites,
Rodrigues Island, Ile aux Aigrettes and Round Island, and (b) the eradication or
control of undesired exotic species (US$110,000);
ii. investment in  required  infrastructure  (nurseries, buildings) for the  ex-situ
propagation and cultivation of threatened plants (US$125,000);
iii. supplies and equipment for propagation, replanting and reseeding of endemic
plants, and reintroduction of endemic animals from captive-bred populations
(US$685,000); and
iv. technical assistance to  strengthen the governmental and  non-governmental
institutions involved, based on a skills audit and training needs analysis
(US$670,000).   This would  develop: (a) skills in  project planning  and
administration, (b) horticultural expertise and facilities to ensure the viability of
support propagation services and the long term holding of plant populations, (c)
expertise in applied conservation biology including the genetic/demographic
management of endangered plant populations, and (d) skills in habitat
monitoring.

Taxes and duties have been excluded from cost estimates. Any taxes and duties on
the project components will be either exempted (eg. for imported equipment) or borne by
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and National Resources (MOA), the beneficiary. A
grant of US$1.2 million is sought from the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund



6
(GEF), while US$0.4 million in related local costs would be funded locally. The financing
plan would include GEF, GOM, and contributions from sugar estates and NGOs as
follows: (i) GEF would finance civil works, equipment, operating costs and
consultants/technical assistance, both local (US$500,000) and foreign (US$700,000); (ii)
GOM would finance about US$200,000 for salaries, local transport and other recurrent
costs of MOA; and (iii) Sugar estates and NGOs, through MWF, would contribute
services valued at US$200,000. A detailed financing plan is shown in Schedule A.
Incremental Costs
16.   The Government of Mauritius is in the process of executing priority elements of a
US$109 million Environmental Investment Plan, using its operating budget and borrowing
from IBRD and other financiers. While GOM has demonstrated clear commitment to
biodiversity protection in its NEAP and EIP, and through financing the establishment of
the Black River Gorges National Park, it cannot afford to pay for the full cost for
biodiversity protection initiatives. There are clearly global benefits in conserving unique
island endemic, species of plants and animals which do not occur outside Mauritius, and
the project therefore qualifies for GEF resources. The government contribution, valued at
US$200,000, includes the MOA salaries, transportation and other recurrent costs to
coordinate the activities. In addition, GOM is donating land for nurseries and has leased
for a nominal fee ($1 per year for 20 years) the entire island of Ile aux Aigrettes to the
MWF.  The private sector would provide free labor (estimated value of at least
US$50,000 over five years) and international and national NGOs are expected to
contribute an estimated US$150,000 to their support for captive breeding facilities. On
completion of the project, recurrent costs would be covered by MWF and its supporting
international NGOs. Of the total estimated project cost of US$1.6 million, the GEF grant
of US$1.2 million would cover the incremental costs.
Rationale for GEF Financing
17.   The project addresses high priority issues identified in Mauritius' NEAP and EIP,
and complements the Black River Gorges National Park initiative financed by GOM. It
seeks to preserve highly threatened endemic species and ecosystems by going beyond
traditional protection measures and establishing a replicable model for species
reintroduction and habitat and ecosystem restoration and monitoring, which would be
especially valuable for other island ecosystem  and species projects.  It involves
Government-NGO partnerships, and brings together international, domestic and private
sector expertise and/or resources, raising awareness domestically and internationally and
increasing opportunities for future resource mobilization. It builds upon the restoration
work initiated by MWF, WWF and UNDP/GEF by expanding and amplifying activities on
critical island habitats. Finally, it strengthens local technical and administrative capacity to
identify and respond to similar biodiversity threats in the future. The project is consistent
with priorities identified by the first Conference of the Parties of the Convention on



7
Biological Diversity since it is a demonstration project to promote conservation of
endemic species in small island ecosystems.
Lessons from Previous Bank and GEF Involvement, and GEF Technical Review
18.   The Bank's considerable experience in environment policy, development and
project execution in Mauritius, including environment projects, yields several lessons
which have been reinforced and detailed by the recommendations of the technical
reviewers. In general, project implementation has been relatively successful, due largely to
the good institutional capacity. The lessons from experience have been incorporated as
follows: (i) All key institutions need to be involved at the onset to ensure strong
ownership. The project was prepared in close cooperation with and enjoys strong
commitment from relevant stakeholders in GOM and the environmental NGO community.
The associated NGOs are experienced in Mauritius and were active in the formulation of
the NEAP and EIP. Two (JWPT, WWF) participated meaningfully in the appraisal of the
Black River Gorges National Park component of the Environmental Monitoring and
Development Project. (ii) The preparation experience of the Pilot GEF Forest Restoration
Project, as well as the technical reviewers, highlighted the need to continuously monitor
and guard against invasive species. The proposed project therefore chooses to work on
off-shore islands to isolate restored species and habitats from invasive species, and to
work with organizations with long-term commitments to these sites.
Project Sustainability
19.   The crucial element for sustainability would be continued monitoring and
maintenance of habitats under restoration.  Sugar estates already provide MOA with
workers, free of charge, to weed exotic species and plant desired species during the
industry's off-season, and this is expected to continue. Using sugar laborers can have the
secondary benefit of raising public awareness of biodiversity conservation issues. Through
its local Forestry Department staff, GOM would maintain the project on Rodrigues.
MWF has long-term leases to manage Ile aux Aigrettes, and is expected to continue to
raise funds internationally and domestically for its activities, including monitoring and
maintenance of project sites. As the project is executed, diminishing maintenance is
expected since the restored ecosystems would grow towards a stable climax state. In the
unlikely event MWF does not renew its lease, GOM may consider visitor fees for Ile aux
Aigrettes (the only accessible site of the three in this project) to raise funds to support
conservation activities.  The project emphasizes strengthening of local technical and
administrative capacity to identify and respond to similar biodiversity threats in the future,
and takes full advantage of the cooperative spirit between government, NGOs and the
private sector to establish long-term relationships.



8
Issues and Actions Agreed
20.   Agreement was reached during negotiations that the following actions will be
completed as conditions of effectiveness: (i) A subsidiary agreement acceptable to the
GEF will be executed on behalf of GOM and MWF to delegate to MWF the procurement
of works, goods and services; and (ii) the MNWF will have hired a program plant
conservation manager, a plant conservation officer for Rodrigues, and a resident warden
for Ile aux Aigrettes. In addition, not later than December 31, 1995, MNWF will prepare a
comprehensive training program as indicated in the Project Description. In the same time
period, MWF will also develop an annual work program for the project, and expand its
indicators of success from earlier restoration activities to cover the proposed project's
activities.
Project Implementation
21.   The project would be implemented by the MWF in collaboration with MOA
(project administration, local transport, some labor), the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust
(island restoration and vertebrate reintroductions), the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew
(training in horticultural and conservation management of threatened plants) and the
Faunal and Floral Preservation Society (training and organizational strengthening). Close
cooperation would be established with the National Parks and Conservation Service and
the Department of Forestry of the MOA, whose staff would work part time in the project.
These staff have submitted a request for a demonstration and research project which aims
to test various eradication and reintroduction methods in a humid upland forest in the
Black River Gorge National Park. The proposal is quite different in scope, ecological
threats addressed, and ecosystem type from the project described in this document, but its
experience with the application of various herbicides will be useful for both projects. The
fact that the same persons will work part time in both projects will ensure that experience
gained in both projects will be shared. The project would be implemented within five
years (Annex 2), and include finalization of the project work and training programs,
institutional strengthening and construction of facilities from mid 1995 to mid-2000.
Procurement
22.   Procurement for gods and works would be in accordance with IBRD's guidelines
for Procurement (January 1995). Civil Works would be undertaken on the basis of
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) in accordance with EBRD's guidelines. Schedule B
summarizes the proposed methods of procurement for the project categories.  The
Borrower's procurement regulations and procedures have recently been reviewed by Bank
staff, and have been found acceptable.
23.   During project implementation, award for GEF-financed goods and works
contracts above a threshold of US$100,000 would be subject to the Bank's prior review.

All equipment and spare parts are expected to be bought through local shopping, on the
basis of at least three price quotations. A quarterly report will be sent to the Bank,
indicating: (i) revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project; (ii)
revised timing of procurement, including advertising, bidding, contract award, and
completion time for individual contracts; and (iii) compliance with aggregate limits on
specified methods of procurement.
24.   Consultant services financed by GEF will be contracted on the basis of the World
Bank Consultant Guidelines (August 1981). The Guidelines require the Bank to review
and to comment on each step by which the Borrower selects consulting firms, including:
(i) preparation of terms of reference and budget; (ii) choice of selection procedure; (iii)
preparation of shorlist (if not single source) and Letter of Invitation; (iv) submission of
winning proposal and evaluation report; and (v) draft contract. A simplified review
process may be used to hire individual consultants.
25.   For small contract value provided by consulting firms and individuals, mandatory
prior review is not required when the cost of submission and prior review of the necessary
procurement documentation out-weighs the benefits derived. Prior review thresholds have
been established for consultant' contracts, at US$100,000 equivalent for consulting firms
selected competitively and US$50,000 equivalent for individuals. Below these thresholds,
the Bank conducts post review except for single source contracts with firms, all TORs and
contract amendments bringing the total above the respective thresholds. At least one
contract in five is selected by random sampling for post review.
Disbursements
26.   Schedule B shows the estimated disbursements which take into account the
disbursement profile for projects in Mauritius. The minimum application size for payments
directly from the Grant Account or for issuance of Special Commitments will be
US$50,000. Disbursements will be fully documented, except that withdrawals will be
made on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) for: civil works and equipment
contracts valued at less than US$100,000 equivalent; consulting firm contracts valued at
less than US$100,000 equivalent, and individual consultant contracts valued at less than
US$50,000 equivalent; and local training.
27.   If requested by the Borrower, and to facilitate disbursements against eligible
expenditures, a Special Account (SA) will be established in the name of MWF. The SA
will be opened and maintained in a commercial bank, acceptable to the Bank, with an
authorized allocation of US$100,000 corresponding to about six months of expenditures.
Replenishment applications will be submitted at monthly intervals and will include
reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents.

Monitoring, Supervision and Audit
28.   Monitoring of the biodiversity component is inherent in project design since
resident technicians would be constantly on location, monitoring project progress and
exotic species invasions, (in case of such invasions, off-season sugar estate labor would be
used to respond). Progress reports would be submitted every six months, and every two
years MWF would prepare, as it already does now, evaluation reports for its activities
(Annex 3). MOA/MWF would jointly prepare a final project evaluation within 6 months
of the project closing date. Supervision will be carried out by the Bank, in line with the
program shown in Annex 4. Annual audits by independant auditors acceptable to the
Bank will be conducted for the project account and submitted to the Bank no later than six
months after the end of each fiscal year.
Environmental and Social Impact and Participation
29.   The project would have a very positive impact on the environment which it would
aim to restore to its original condition; the restoration of the habitat would help save
threatened species from extinction and contribute to the preservation of world natural
heritage. This project is not expected to have any negative social impacts. Its target areas
are not only uninhabited, but are not currently used for economic purposes. It was
prepared with support from MOA and MEQL, and would be executed by MWF, a
respected local NGO. Through the use of off-season labor from sugar estates, it would
increase local awareness and ownership of biodiversity restoration efforts.
Project Benefits
30.   The project would result in the preservation of endemic flora and associated fauna,
and serve both as a model for ecosystem restoration and a learning experience for similar
projects in the region and elsewhere.
Risks
31.   The project is exposed to various risks, including damage from hurricanes, drought
and the inadvertent introduction of alien species. The risks would be addressed by the
presence of a warden and other project staff on the project site and by detailed project
monitoring. Another risk would be if participating NGOs and sugar estates discontinued
their involvement. They have not indicated any intention to withdraw support. The
Government has agreed to provide labor support as required.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENT STATUS
Mauritius' performance in the implementation of its Bank-associated projects has
traditionally matched the high quality of its economic management. As part of the
country's drive to reach a higher level of economic performance, the focus of new
operations has become directed towards more complex institutional goals, often requiring
for their achievement the cooperation of various interest groups. This has led to slow
preparation of projects and delayed start-up of implementation and slow disbursement.
For example, the preparation of the Industrial and Vocational Training Project was slow,
as it required close cooperation between GOM and the private sector. Similarly, the
effectiveness of the Bagasse Energy Development Project was delayed by time-consuming
negotiations of contracts between GOM and the prospective private sector partner in the
project. Efforts made in FY94 to resolve start-up difficulties are beginning to yield
results. Staffing problems that delayed the inception of activities under the Agricultural
Management and Services Project (AMSP) have been overcome.  The contract
negotiations under the Sugar Energy Development Project (SEDP) have been concluded
and project implementation has begun. All projects have implementation manuals and a
project workshop was held in May 1995 to launch the newest addition to the portfolio--
Higher and Technical Education. Mauritius has no problem projects and no issues of
counteipart funding. Procurement problems also do not exist. The key implementation
problem of the Mauritian portfolio of recent years--slow pace of implementation of a new
range of projects--is being addressed by intensified supervision efforts aimed at facilitating
and speeding-up decision-making among the interested parties. With the addition of two
new projects in FY94-95, the disbursement ratio in FY95 may well be under 10%,
considerably below the 19.8% achieved in FY94. Consequently, sustained efforts are
needed to return Mauritius to its former superior rating.

SUMMARY OF TECHNICAL REVIEW AND OUTCOMES
1.    The technical reviewer commented positively on the proposal for the Mauritius
Biodiversity Restoration Project, appreciating such project features as: (a) establishing a
model for species/ecosystem protection and rehabilitation; (b) building on successful local
initiatives already underway; (c) involving collaboration with high quality international
NGOs; and (d) being limited but feasible in scope. The reviewer recommended building in
long-term monitoring and control of exotic species in the future, and requiring local
counterpart financing.
2.    The reviewer recommendation that long-term monitoring and control of exotic
species was made part of the project design. This would be done by ensuring that the
principal executing agencies (Department of Forestry and MWF) have staff assigned and
long-term commitments to the project sites to monitor the success of eradication programs
of exotic species. Furthermore, the control of exotic species will be made easier due to
the isolation and/or protection of all three sites; hence there is a relatively low risk of
introduction of exotic species. A local counterpart contribution additional to the financial
support pledged by the Government and the MWF is an arrangement with sugar estates to
provide the project with labor to weed exotic species. This is a popular program among
laborers and estate owners which was tested elsewhere. It is not expected to change.
Finally, local NGO's support to the project was obtain through a wide circulation of the
project documentation.

lie Aux Aigrettes lies about a mile offshore along the South-Eastern part of
Maufitius. It is a low-lying flat island of only 25 ha. Access is easy by boat
through a shallow lagoon. There are simple quarters on the island for the
warden and for the volunteers who work in the restoration project. There
is also a small plant nursery. The island contains the last viable area for
coastal ebony forest, a type of forest now lost on the island of Mauritius.
However, the island is also heavily overgrown with invasive exotic plant
species from the mainland, in particular the Chinese Guava, which threatens
to out-compete the endemic species. Because of its easy access, flat
topography and proximity to the mainland, the island will eventually be
suitable for limited ecotourism.
(b)   Conservation Background.
Ile Aux Aigrettes has been leased for 20 years by the Mauritian
Government to the Mauritius Wildlife Fund (MWF) which has started an
ambitious restoration program. Invaluable assistance is obtained free of
charge from the sugar estates which supply labor during the off-season.
This labor is mainly used for weeding and planting.  Recently, a
reintroduction program has started for the Mauritius Kestrel and the Pink
Pigeon which seems to be successful. A small group of Aldabra tortoises is
held in captivity on Ile Aux Aigrettes for eventual release in the wild.
(c)   Biological Value of lle Aux Aigrettes.
After implementation of the project, Ile Aux Aigrettes will be the only area
of coastal ebony forest in the Mascarenes. It will also harbor endemic
species of fauna, the most important being the Mauritius Kestrel and the
Pink Pigeon. Being isolated from the mainland, there is no threat from
animals introduced on the mainland such as wild boars, deer or monkeys
which have had such a disastrous effect on the native plants of Mauritius
itself  Because it will be impossible to eradicate these species, the
sustainable rehabilitation of large areas on the Mauritian mainland will

probably not be possible. Also, seed dispersion from exotics by wind and
by birds will be much less than on the mainland and therefore it is to be
expected, that once restored, Ile Aux Aigrettes will require much less
maintenance than the restoration areas on the mainland.
(d)   Ecological Restoration.
The aim of the project is the complete restoration of the island, which
means eradication of all exotic species by weeding and replanting the island
with indigenous species.  Much research will have to be done into
propagation methods and optimal species composition.   Already a
remarkable success has been achieved in a few hectares and much
experience has been gained for the implementation of the project. Within
the first three months of the project, MWF will develop a year-by-year
work program for the project and provide indicators of success.
2.    Round Island.
(a)   Physical Description.
The uninhabited Round Island lies 22.5 km. NE of the Mauritian mainland,
has an area of 151 ha. and rises to a height of 280 m. From a distance it
looks like a dome shaped cone rising out of the sea. It is one of six small
uninhabited islands immediately North of Mauritius.
Slopes are steep, averaging 10-15 degrees over the lower two-thirds of the
island, and increasing to 20-25 degrees in the upper third. The crater,
which has been breached and partly eroded away by wave action from the
south-east, forms the eastem side of the island where the general slope is
32 degrees.
The rock throughout the island is composed of successive beds of tuff
formed from deposits of volcanic ash and contained a few large boulders of
solid basalt. High intensity rainfalls during cyclonic storms have cut ravines
on all sides of the island which become deeper as the shoreline is
approached. Physical weathering from wind and water is very active and
the overlapping ash beds have been sculptured into numerous cavernous
overhangs, steps pedestals and other weird shapes. The Northern end of
the island is a mixture of cliffs, narrow ledges and very steep slopes, and
the greater part of the shoreline is bounded by sheer cliffs 50-100 m. high.
The combination of broken topography and weathered rock, which is often



31
Annex 5
Paee 3 of 6
treacherous for foot or hand holds, means that care must be exercised at all
times in traversing the island.
Access by boat to the island is very difficult as there is usually a high swell
and jagged rock descends steeply into the sea all around the island. There
are a few ledges in places and the "easiest" way to get on shore is by
swimming and climbing onto one of these ledges. This difficulty of access
is at the same time a great advantage for the conservation of the island.
The only safe and easy access for restoration parties in the future is by way
of helicopter as has been done in the past.
(b)   Conservation Background.
Round Island was designated a Nature Reserve in 1957 and is administered
by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Natural Resources. Rabbits
appear to have been introduced on the island in the late eighteenth century
and goats around 1850. As has happened on many oceanic islands, the
effect of these browsing and grazing mammals has resulted in dramatic
degradation of the vegetative cover. The island's palm savanna community
was seriously depleted and its hardwood forest lost altogether. When
goats were eradicated from Round Island in 1979, followed by rabbits in
1986, the island became the largest area in the Mascarene group free of
introduced mammals.   After more than  a century of destructive
modification by these animals, as well as man, it suddenly became possible
to begin reversing the trends which were taking the island's native palms,
lizards and snakes to extinction.
(c)   Biological Values of Round Island.
Round Island has exceptional biological value in:
(i)    Being the largest area, and the only relatively large island in the
Mascarenes free of introduced mammals. It is also one of the very few
remaining elevated tropical islands in the world that is rodent free.
(ii)   Being the largest area of native vegetation and the only relatively
large island in the Mascarenes free of major woody weeds.
(iii) Supporting the last remnants of a palm savanna once characteristic
of the Northern Plain of Mauritius.

(iv)   Providing habitat for at least ten species of threatened native plants
including six species endemic to Mauritius.
(v)   Providing habitat for eight species of native reptile including six
species that are endangered: two geckos, two skinks and two primitive
boa snakes. All of these species are endemic to the Mascarenes and four
now occur only on Round Island.
(vi)   Providing the only known breeding ground in the Indian Ocean for
a race of the Herald Petrel (Ptrerodroma arminjoniana). The island has the
largest breeding populations of wedge-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus
pacificus chlororhynchus) and white tailed and red tailed tropic birds
(Phaeton lepturus, Phaeton rubricauda) in the Mascarenes. Round Island
may also support small breeding populations of Bulwer's petrel (Bulweria
bulwerii), recorded only rarely in the Indian Ocean, Audubon's shearwater
(Puffinus bailloni) and little shearwater (Puffinus assimilis), all of which
have been found on the island between 1986 and 1988.
(d)   Ecological Restoration.
In 1989, the Mauritian Ministry of Agriculture in cooperation with the
Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust prepared a Management Plan for the
Restoration of Round Island. This Management Plan provides a detailed
timetable for essential management actions on Round Island for ten years.
Restoration will initially focus on the palm savanna and re-establishment of
the hardwood forest. Nine species of pioneer hardwood species have
already been selected. Restoring locally extinct animals to Round Island is
a longer term goal. The initial activities will mainly consist of weeding and
monitoring trips three times per year and trials of reseeding and replanting
of native species.
3.    Rodrigues.
(a)   Physical Description.
Rodrigues, the second largest island belonging to Mauritius, lies 500 km. to
the East of Mauritius. The central part of the island is mountainous with
steep slopes and gorges in places where the remnants of the original largely
endemic flora and fauna have found a last refuge, due to the inaccessibility
of the terrain. Closer to the ocean, there are flatter areas. Unlike on
Mauritius, the vegetation has not been cleared primarily for sugar cane
cultivation, but for livestock ranching with equally devastating results.



33
Annex 5
Pafe 5 of 6
Consequently, most of the vegetation is grassy and trees have mainly been
planted to provide fruits or timber. The island is surrounded by extensive
coral reefs which offer good opportunities for the development of marine
ecotourism.
The main access to the island is by air and there are frequent flights from
Mauritius.
(b)   Conservation Background.
Less known than the Dodo of Mauritius, Rodrigues also had its flightless
bird, the Solitaire, which similarly vanished soon after the island became
settled. An endemic species of land tortoise was so numerous that ships
made a special detour to stack their hulls with live tortoises which supplied
their crews with fresh meat for months. They also became extinct within a
short time. Special conservation efforts have so far been given to the
endangered endemic Rodrigues friit bat which is bred in captivity in the
Jersey Zoo and in the Black River captive breeding station on Mauritius.
The Forestry Department is at present actively engaged in a reforestation
program  including the restoration with endemic tree species of three
reserve areas: Grande Montagne, Cascade Mourouk and Anse Quitor.
These areas are fenced off against cattle and goats and a weeding and
replanting scheme is being implemented. The endemic species to be
replanted are propagated in a nursery. Already an increase in the numbers
of the two endemic bird species (Rodrigues Fody and Rodrigues Warbler)
has been noted in Grande Montagne due to the early results of the
restoration activities.
(c)   Biological Value of Rodrigues.
The biological value of Rodrigues is considerable because of its high level
of botanical endemicity. The only chance for this botanical richness to
survive is in the three restoration areas. There are at least 45 endemic
higher plants and trees on Rodrigues.  Most of these are critically
endangered, seven species survive with fewer than 10 individuals and of
one (a species of wild coffee which may have commercial interest) only one
individual is left.  One species of Hybiscus (Hybiscus liliflorus) with
beautiful pink flowers could have considerable potential as an ornamental
plant. There are only two very old individuals left. Animal species of
particular conservation interest are two species of highly endangered

endemic birds, the Rodrigues Fody and the Rodrigues Warbler and the
endemic Rodrigues Fruit Bat.
(d)   Ecological Restoration.
The project will focus on three different areas, two are mountain slopes and
one area is part of a river gorge. Of the surviving 45 endemic higher plant
species of Rodrigues, 41 can be propagated in a nursery and planted in the
reserves. Research will be carried out into the propagation technique of
the other four which eventually might be propagated and planted as well.
A major part of the work will consist of weeding exotics and fencing of the
areas to prevent browsing by cattle and goats.
