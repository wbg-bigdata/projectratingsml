INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRE3IDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A
NORTH SUMATRA SMALLHOLDER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$5.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for smallholder
development.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent Bank report on Indonesia, "Development Issues
for Indonesia" (25-IND of December 1, 1972), dealt principally with longer-
term development issues for the Indonesian economy but also contained a dis-
cussion of recent economic developments. Country data are presented at
Annex I. Indonesia's economic progress continues to be satisfactory. The
rate of growth of GIP, averaging 5 percent from 1965-1970, accelerated to
6-7 percent in 1971 and this momentum appears to have been sustained in 1972.
The production of rice, the basic commodity, increased substantially for four
successive years, although this year's crops are being seriously affected by
drought con tions and rice imports are being expanded to over 1 million tons
in 1972/73a/ (about 8 percent of total domestic requirements) to meet the
current shortages. In the industrial sector, there has been further substantial
growth in the production of textiles as well as of other consumer and industrial
goods. The rehabilitation and expansion of domestic enterprises, backed by a
continuing inflow of private investment and commitments of official aid for
several major industrial projects, suggests that the prospects are good for
further industrial growth from the present small base. Infrastructure rehabili-
tation and expansion is underway, financed in large measure by project aid,
including IDA credits. Deficiencies in the transport, power and telecommunica-
tions sectors, however, could become a constraint on agricultural and industrial
growth unless special efforts are made in project implementation.
3.        In the public sector, Government revenues in 1971/72 were 20 percent
higher than in the previous year. A much larger increase, 33 percent, is fore-
cast for 1972/73. The largest item in this increase would be taxes on expected
higher earnings of foreign oil companies. Other revenues could increase by 16
percent. The expected increase in revenues of Rp 136 billion (US$327 million)
after financing increases in salaries and material expenditures in the routine
a/ Indonesian financial year, April 1 - March 31.



-2-
budget would allow for nearly a doubling (to Rp 116 billion or US$ 328 million)
of the surplus available for the development budget. Together with counterpart
funds generated by program aid (estimated at Rp 95 billion or US$229 million),
this would provide for a development budget in 1972/73 of Rp 211 billion (US$508
million), which is 45 percent more than in 1971/72.
4).      EThe balance of payments situation has improved steadily.   An important
factor has been debt rescheduling and the financial assistance provided by the
Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia (IGGI). Exports, led by oil, have expan-
ded at an unprecedented rate in recent years, but imports have also risen rapidly.
Recorded exports from Indonesia rose by nearly 30 percent in the last two years,
and they are expected to rise even more in 1972/73, reaching US$1,235 million,
largely as a result of sharp increases in the voluwTe and value of oil exports.
Foreign exchange reserves, usually negative on a net basis, increased rapidly
in the first nine months of 1972, mainly because of a substantial inflow of
private capital attracted by high Indonesian interest rates, and reached a net
level of US$238 million at the end of September 1972.
5.        The Government is now in the process of assessing Indonesia's past
performance and future economic potential as part of its projections for the
second five-year plan, which is to come into effect in April 1974. This plan
is expected to address itself more directly than was possible in the rehabilita-
tion phase to the issues of employment, income distribution and regional develop-
ment. Although the ability of the Indonesian Government to formulate and implement
plans, programs and projects has improved, the limited managerial capacity pre-
sents a serious obstacle to more rapid growth. This problem, as well as the need
to continue to improve the mobilization of domestic savings, will also have to be
considered in the formulation of the plan.
6.        Bank Group assistance to Indonesia is a part of the international support
being given in increasing amounts through the IGGI.   Aid commitments have risen
from US$200 million equivalent in 1967 to well over US$600 million for 1972/73.
The proportion of project aid has steadily increased over this period, but sub-
stantial program aid remains essential as support for the balance of payments and -
in spite of strong domestic revenue efforts - as a source of additional funds for
the development budget. For 1972/73 the Government requested IGGI aid of US$670
million equivalent, of which US$350 million was for program aid, including US$110
million in food supplies. At its meeting in Amsterdam in December 1971, the IGGI
accepted this request, endorsed by the Bank and the Fund, as appropriate in the
light of Indonesia's requirements. At the subsequent pledging session in April
1972, express or implied commitments made by IGGI members amounted to some US$724
million equivalent, approximately meeting the request for food and non-food program
aid and substantially exceeding the amount sought in project aid. In addition,
Japan has provided the equivalent of US$200 million of untied aid on concessional
terms outside the TGGI framework for the development of the oil sector. All aid
from the IGGI members has been given on concessional terms approximating the



-3-
standards set by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD. The
IGGI met again on December 21, 1972 to consider the Indonesian aid request for
new conmmitments of US$760 million in project and program aid for the 1973/74
financia year. This request was agreed by the IGGI to be reasonable and realis-
tic in terms of Indonesia's requirements.
7.        The rescheduling negotiations for pre-1966 external debt, which culmi-
nated in April 1970 in an agreement on long-term settlement of the debts held by
Western creditors and Japan, and in a subsequent agreement on similar lines with
several Eastern Earopean countries, resulted in a ratio of external debt service
to exports of about 11 percent. It will rise appreciably through the 1970's as
grace periods expire on aid received after 1966, but should remain manageable
during the decade if exports increase at projected rates, restraints on medium-
term borrowing are maintained, and new aid is made available on concessional
terms similar to those at present obtained from the IGGI.

PART II - BANK RHOUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
8.        In order to accelerate the pace of economic development,
Indonesia will require, in addition to continued substantial external
support, some change in emphasis from rehabilitation and improvement of
infrastructure to the expansion of its production capabilities in agri-
culture, minerals, forestry and manufacturing. It will also require
continued streagthieningof the institutions for the planning of development
and the management of the economy. Welfare and income distribution,
including fanily planning, as well as regional development and related
patterns of employment and population movements, also need to be given an
important place in Indonesia's development strategy.
9.        The work at both the Resident Mission in Indonesia and at Head-
quarters and the lending activities of the Banik Group have been oriented
towards these development objectives. The focus of the Bank's economic
work in providing assistance to the Government in the current preparation
of Indonesia's next five-year plan is also along these lines.
10.       Consistent with Indonesia's larSe external resource requirements
and diSficult balance of payments problems, the Bank Group's lending to
Indonesia (aside from IFC investments) has been and will most probably
continue in the foreseeable future to be in the form of IDA credits. In
recognition of the urgent need for institutional reforms, most IDA-financed
projects have been associated with ma4or reorganizations of existing insti-
tutions or the establishment of new ones, and most credits have included
appropriate provisions for consultants' services and other technical
assistance.
11.       Priority projects in Indonesia commonly involve a high proportion
of local costs. Even with the substantial pro;ram assistance made available
through the IGGI, and Indonesia's improving savings effort, it would be
difficult to meet her need for capital if external capital lenders were to
lend only for the import component of project6. Moreover, the foreign
exchange component of projects in the agriculture and social sectors is
frequently low and local currency financing is necessary if the Association
is to increase its involvemenit in these important sectors. The Bank Group
has therefore covered some local expenditure in its financing and will
continue to do so in future in cases where the foreign exchange component
of project expenditure is low.
12.       To date, Indonesia has received 25 IDA. credits amounting to
US$336.5 million. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits
and IFC investaents as of December 31, 1972 and notes on the execution of
on-going projects. The composition of this lending reflects the priorities
for rehabilitation and development established by the Government. Indonesia's
First Five-Year Plan (1969-1974) gives highest priority to agriculture. The
Association has already extended four credi.ts to help rehabilitate and develop
plantations in the Government estates sector. Other credits for agriculture



-5-
include four to assist rehabilitation of irrigation systems, one for
fisheries, and one to help increase rice yields throughout Indonesia by
establishing a seed multiplication program for high-yielding rice varieties.
The Association also organized a consortium of lenders to finance a major
expansion of the PUSRI fertilizer plant. These 11 credits account for more
than half of the Association's lending to Indonesia.
13.       To assist in the rehabilitation of other priority sectors, credits
have also been extended for highways, power, telecommunications, industrial
financing, education, inter-island fleet rehabilitation  and population.
In addition, three technical assistance credits have been made to finance
pre-investment studies undertaken by the Ctovernment, which have helped to
establish investment priorities over a wide range of activities.
14.       The first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in September 1968,
and 17 of the 25 credits have been made since July 1970. The program is
thus new, and the undisbursed portion of the credits is therefore relatively
large. Virtually every credit has been associated with extensive institu-
tional reforms involving, inter alia, the creation of new project authorities,
drafting of new charters, and enactment of new legislation, all of which
have taken, in most cases, much time. Several credits - including the first
two for agricultural estates projects - have experienced delays in disburse-
ment because of management problems (Annex II).
15.       For FY73 a credit for a beef cattle development project has
already been approved. Projects for smallholder and private tea estate
development, sugar industry rehabilitation, highways, a thermal power station,
an industrial estate, and education are expected to be presented to the
Executive Directors in the next several months. Projects in fisheries
and irrigation, as well as in tourism, water supply and urban development-
are also being prepared for IDA financing.
PART III - THE SMALLHOLDER SECTOR IN INDONESIA
16.       Agricultural production in Indonesia accounts for 50 percent of
GNP, 60 percent of total exports, and 70 percent of employment. There are
several difficulties in increasing production growth in this sector. Two
major constraints are (a) institutional bottlenecks which impede the expansion
of production in the outer islands where the greatest growth prospects lie,
and (b) the absence, except in the case of rice, of concerted efforts to
increase and diversify production in the smallholder sector which dominates
agriculture. Without more effective methods of stimulating smallholder
production, including land distribution, land expansion schemes, and credit
programs, necessary further growth in agriculture cannot be achieved.
17.       An agriculture sector mission which visited Indonesia in February
and March 1972 reviewed in detail the problems and potential of smallholder
agriculture. Smallholders, who form 75 percent of the country's 118 million
population, produce 70 percent of all agricultural exports. Rubber is the



-6-
main item (h0 percent of total exports), two-thirds of which is produced
by smallholders.  However, smallholders so far have received no significant
technical and financial assistance and the smallholder sub-sector lacks most
forms of economic infrastructure.  Snallholders generally have very snall,
uneconomically sized farms, producing low yields of poor quality rubber
from over-aged trees, and there has been little or no replanting with
high-yielding varieties. Farm gate prices are around 30 percent of rubber
export prices, compared with an estimated 67 percent in Malaysia, and
overall efficiency and incomes in the sub-sector remain low.
18.       The agriculture sector mission, whose report will shortly be
available, emphasizes the importance of improving smallholder rubber
production if any significant overall increase in Indonesia's rubber
production is to be achieved. All possibilities for improvement and diver-
sification in the smallholder subsector should be thoroughly explored,
including processing of smallholder production by existing Government
estate facilities, development and planting of new and unused land, and
development of programs to provide smallholders with training and technical
assistance, as well as farm inputs under appropriate credit programs. For
the future, 15-20 million hectares of currently unused land appear suitable
for further expansion of plantation crops, principally rubber, oil palm,
cocoa and coconut.
19.       The proposed project would be the Associationts first credit for
the smallholder sub-sector in Indonesia and would include three elements
important to any program designed to assist the sector: (a) the provision
of financial and technical assistance for planting and replanting of rubber
and oil palm and the construction of primary latex processing facilities;
(b) the distribution of land to very small farmers and to landless estate
laborers; and (c) the improvement of communications and marketing. It
would be the Government's first muajor effort t..o assist the smallholder
rubber industry and to evaluate the reactions of smallholders to a range
of development activities to determine appropriate future development
strategy for the sub-sector.    The appraisal report "Indonesia: Smallholder
Development Project, North Sumatrall (PA-lltOa) dated January 19, 1973, is
being circulated to the Ececutive Directors separately, and a suimnary project
description is attached as Annex III to this report.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
20.       The proposed project was prep-ared for the Government by the Common-
wealth Development Corporation, whose contract was financed under the North
Sumatra Agricultural Estates Project (Credit No. 155-IND).  It was appraised,



-7-
in November-Dhcembor 1971, and negotiations w-,ere hl1d in ',Washington from
October 10-2-, 1972. Trne Governmnent's delegation was headed by General
yu-uk LAlbis. Director-General cf Estates.
Tne Project
21.       The proposed project iJs designed to nrea.s  'he production and
inconmes of about 1.8,000 sanal'holders -und thb;ir fs.:.ilon  (about 90,000 people
in all) in the Labuhan Batu Regency of North.         whrs.rn, wile serving as the
experinental phase of a more extuenGire iDvestment ,,rogranri in the smallholder
sector.  lhe project involves distribu,or; o,f 9,200 ha of l;and to landless
estate laborers and s-mallholders fith eineoonc-hized arms.   Credits and
grants would be provided to, thes,e _aaner9 anc, othbers fo. the planting and
replanting of rubtber, oil palm ;nd rice 0.. thei' i wn land and the land dis-
tributed under the vro-lect.  Ah ey vned ann. i p.,roved smnal1holder extension
service -ard training for smallholders a  an. nulcd 'n the project, as are
the construction and rehabilitation of ro7acd-, azr bn: il-i.ngs irn the project
area. About 800 Group Coagulating (Oentor  'GC;; will be construct,ed to
improve the q?lality of the latex of mosl of the s-mal2holders in the project
area.  To facilitate the planring of fluture sr.allhol.der prcjects, aerial
photograph.y of about one million hectares in the --ioinity of the project
area wou]ld be undertaken.  Funds for studies nece.:sary to prepare future
projects are also included.
Organ zation and Maiagement
22,       The project would be executed by a Projeect Management Unit (PMU)
established as a separate project executing agency within the Ministry of
Agricultuire. A Project Management Board, headed b.r the Eirector-General
of Estates and including the Director of 'Smallhoders and senior represen-
tatives of BAPPENAS (the National Planring Agency)9 the Ministry of Finance,
and Bank Rakyat Indonesia, wo-ald be responsible for overall policy.  The
P4U, with hea,dquarters at the project site, w,ulld be headed by a project
manager, who would be assisted in the day-to-day executicn and management
of the project by three inteniationally reornited apeci.alic.ts in small-
holder activities.  These specialists would fill the positions of financial
controller, extension and training officer, and land use and planning
officer.  As conditions of effectiveness of the crsdit, the Government has
agreed to establish the Project Management Bcard oiiAd MUT, to appoint the
project manager and the three specialist executive assistants, and to acquire,
free for project use, the lands and buildings neoessa.ry for execution of' the
project.
23.       In similar project units established i.n other credits, recruitment
and retention of qualified project staff have been hampered by the low level
of Government salaries. To attempt to overcome the problen in this project,
the Government has agreed that project unit staff would receive total annual
emoluments equivalent to those received by GTovernment estate staff with
similar experience and qualifications.



-8-
Land Distribution and Grants and Credits
24.       For executiorn of the project, the Government would make available
about 10,700 ha of old, uneconomic estate lands. In addition, about 1,400 ha
of commonly owned land would be made available by local village authorities.
About 9,200 ha of this land would be plantable and would be sub-divided among
about 1,000 workers from the old estates into lots of 3 ha each, and into lots
of 2 ha each among about 3,100 existing smallholders whose farms are less than
2 ha in size. These smallholders would receive credits, in cash and kind, to
establish 2 ha of rubber or 1 ha each of rubber and oil palm. Under the pro-
ject, about 3,700 ha of rubber and 2,600 ha of oil palm would be planted with
this assistance.  Estate workers receiving 3 ha of land would not be eligible
for assistance to plant their third hectare, and it is expected they would use
part of this land for subsistence crops and eventually develop it from their
own resources. During the first three years of development of their plots,
smallholders would intercrop all plantings with rice to provide supplemental
income until the rubber trees and oil palms begin producing.  Lands allocated
under the project would be surveyed and registered by the Agrarian Department
and temporary leases issued to project participants. Annual rent would be
paid by the smallholders until a fixed amount (Rp 40,000 per ha) has been
paid for the land, at which time, if repayment of credit has also been com-
pleted, title iwould be issued.
25.       In addition, about 2,000 existing smallholders who grow rubber on
between 2 and 10 ha of land to which they have rights of use under Adat
(customary) Law would receive grants to replant one ha of rubber each. Credits
to these farmers would be imprac-tical since land held under Adat Law cannot
be used as collateral and there are so many market outlets for rubber that
collection of credit repayments by coagulum purchasers or processors would
be impossible. However, another 700 existing smallholders would receive credits
for replacing of one ha of rubber with oil pa]-x,  This crop has a higher value
and is quicker maturing than rubber, and processing facilities for palm oil are
fewer in number, so that processors could effectively collect credit repayments
on Bank Rakyat's behalf.
26.       The credits and grants would entitle smallholders to receive from the
PMU necessary inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, tools, cover crop seeds and
planting materials.)  In addition, the smallholders would, upon satisfactory
completion of their farm work program each year, receive a cash bonus to pro-
vide the-m with supplemental income until their plantings come into production.
Credit terms and conditions, appropriate to Government practice in these matters,
and the ability of the smallholders to repay, would be agreed with the Associa-
tion.
27.       A smallholder eligible for assistance from the credit program would
sign an appropriate credit agreement with Bank Rakyat Indoniesia and would then
be entitled to receive farm inputs from the PMU, his credit account with the
Bank being debited for the value of these goods. Cash payments to smallholders
would be macle directly to the farmer by the Bank on the advice of the FMU. The
Bank would serve as the Government's agent for collection of credit repayments.
Farmers eligible for grants for the replanting of rubber would deal only with
the PMU.



-9-
Project Infrastructure
28.       About 60 km of feeder roads and 180 km of crop extraction tracks in
the project area would be rehabilitated or constructed. Stores, offices and
houses needed for PMU staff would be constructed or rehabilitated as appropriate.
GCC's would be small structures built of local materials and would include latex
coagulating tanks and mangles sufficient to handle production from about 20 small-
holders. These centers would also serve as basic marketing units where agents
would buy coagulum from smallholders under PMU supervision.  Smallholders would
maintain the GCC's and purchase any necessary supplies from the PMU.
Project Cost and Financing
29.       Total project cost is estimated to be about US$10.0 million equivalent,
of which about US.$4.9 million would be in foreign exchange. The proposed IDA
credit of US$5.0 million would meet 50 percent of total project costs and in-
cludes a small amount of local currency financing. The Government would pro-
vide its share of project costs from budgetary resources. Of total project
cost, about 26 percent is for direct on-farm expenditures (tools, planting
materials, fertilizers, etc.), 22 percent for the PMU, teclhical assistance
and studies, 29 percent for civil works and vehicles, and 23 percent for con-
tingencies (see Annex III).
30.       Funds for provision of credit to smallholders would be provided
through an account in Bank Rakyat Indonesia under the control of the PMU. Bank
Rakyat would only act as the fiscal agent of the Government and would bear no
risk in the extension of credit to smallholders from this account. Funds for
grants, PMU overhead expenditures and project infrastructure would be made
available directly to the PMU. Project funds would be replenished quarterly
on the basis of annual budget estimates prepared by the PMU and approved by
the Project Management Board. The Government has agreed to review from time
to time the procedures by which funds are made available for the project, and
to implement such procedures as it and the Association agree are necessary for
the efficient execution of the project.
31.       A project account, recording all payments for goods and services re-
quired for the project, would be established and maintained by the PMU. The
account would be kept in accordance with sould accounting principles, and would
be audited by an independent auditor.
DLsbursement
32.       For vehicles, tractors, fertilizers and pesticides the credit would
be disbursed for the c.i.f. costs or, in the case of locally manufactured goods,
the ex-factory price net of Indonesian taxes. DLsbursements would also be made
for 100 percent of the foreign exchange expenditures for the three specialists
employed in the PMU, and 60 percent of the total cost of studies and aerial
photography, of construction of coagulating centers and new project buildings,
and of tools, cover crop seeds, planting materials, and cash payments provided
for farmers. Conclusion of arrangements between the Government and Bank Rakyat



- 10 -
Indonesia to implement the credit program for smallholders, preparation of a
lease form, and suitable credit and grant agreements for smallholders, all
satisfactory to the Association, are conditions of credit disbursement for
the tools, seedsj planting materials and cash payments.
Procurement
33.       VehLcles, tractors and implements, fertilizers and pesticides, would
be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Guidelines for Procurement. For the purposes of bid comparison, a 15 percent
preference margin, or the actual tariff duty, whichever was less, would be
granted to qualified local manufacturers of these goods. Goods and services
required for the construction of GCC's and other buildings would be procured
in accordance with the Guidelines, except that advertisements may be limited
to newspapers of general circulation in Indonesia, and that copies of invita-
tions to bid need not be transmitted to representatives of IDA member countries.
This procedure is considered appropriate in view of the diversity and small
size of the contracts involved.
Project Benefits
34.       The project would increase production of rubber and palm oil for
export and of rice for domestic consumption.  It would also test methods of
helping smallholders to increase production and raise their incomes. The
economic return on the project over its 30-year life is conservatively esti-
mated at 13.4L percent. This is considered satisfactory in view of the
experimental nature of the project and the substantial unquantified benefits
of, inter alia, project-generated employment and improved extension services
for smallholders.  At full development in 1990, project plantings would pro-
duce some 9,500 tons of rubber, 10,600 tons of palm oil, and 2,000 tons of
palm kernels annually. During the first eight years of the project, when
rubber and palm oil plantings would be inter-cropped with rice, about 29,400
tons of rice would be produced. The net foreign exchange earnings over the
life of the project would be about US.$57 million.
35.       Four groups of farmers would be helped under the project:  (a) 11,200
farmers using GCC's; (b) 2,700 farmers helped -to replant one hectare of rubber
with either oil palm or rubber;  (c) 1,000 estate laborers provided with 3 ha
of land each; and (d) 3,100 smallholders with uneconomic-sized farms provided
with 2 ha of additional land each.  Aside from the GCC users, who would profit
only marginally from the project, the average income per family of five would
increase from the present level of about Rp 50,000 (US$120) to an average in-
come of about Rp 154,000 (US$370) per annum over the life of the new investment,
an increase of about 210 percent. Incremental incomes would start to accrue
in year 4 or 6 of the project participation, depending on whether the farmer
grows oil palm or rubber.



PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
36.       The draft Dsvelopment Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Associa-
tion, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being
distributed to the Executive MLrectors separately. The draft Agreement
conforms to the normal pattern for credits for smallholder agriculture
projects.
37.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
38.       I recommend that the Ezecutive DLrectors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

Cr. No. 127   Irrigation Rehabilitation; US.5.0 Million Credit of
September , 1968; Closing Date: June 30, 197h.
This project has progressed well and irnrgation works are
scheduled for completion in March 1974.   In order to obtain full economic
benefits from the project the remainder of the drainage works must be
completed, and this is expected to take until mid-1975, wnich is about one
year behind schedule. At the time of appraisal of the irrigation rehabilitation
project a sensitivity analysis was carried out allowing for a two-year delay in
construction. In no case did the economic return drop below 20 percent.
Cr. No. 135   Technical Assistance;   US$2.0 Million Credit of December 27,
1965; Closing Date: January 31, 197h.
The preinvestment studies financed by this credit are progressing
satisfactorily and the credit is nearly fully committed. In order to complete
disbursements for on-going studies, we have recently agreed to postpone the
closing for one year, to January 31, 1974.
Cr. No. 154   Hi ghways  _   8 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;   Closing
a e: Decem er 319
This credit finances equipment for highway maintenance and
a specific highway rehabilitation program. Initial delays in project
execution arose from the unfamiliarity of the Indonesian officials with
Bank procurement procedures and administrative inefficiencies in disburse-
ment of loc-l funds. The project is now progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 155   Agricultural Estates:   US$16 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Clopin   Date:   June 30  1974.
This project is about one year behind its oriol nal schedule
due to delay ir. appointing management advisors and visiting inspectors.
The project development progr'am is now being 2Xfllowed satisfactorily with
the exception of oil palm planting and replanting programs, which have been
restricted by an unforeseen :Lack of suitable planting materials. However,
suitable material is no-w being produced. The project also suffers from
weak management and inadequate Government control of the estates involved.
A timetable of specific improvements and managerial changes is being
discussed with the Government. The Government is also reviewing the
findings of a management survey report (financed under Credit No. 216)
covering all Government agricultural estates, and is discussing with the

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and -with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 165   Electricity Distribution;  US$15 Million Credit of
October 29, 19b9; Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
This project is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 193   PUSRI Fertilizer Expansion;  US$30 Million Credit of June 15,
1970;  Closing Date:  December 31, 1975      -
Implementation of this project began nearly a year later than
anticipated in the appraisal report because of the time required to meet
all the conditions of effectiveness, to select contractors on bid specifi-
cations acceptable to all co-lenders and to negotiate contracts satisfactory
to all parties. Since the conclusion of the contracts, Part I (construction
of an ammonia-urea fertilizer complex with an annual capacity of 380,000
metric tons of urea) has progressed well and the contractors, spurred on
by a penalty-bonus arrangement, are now ahead of the new schedule. Part II
(construction and installation of a natural gas gathering system and a
65-mile transmission line to the fertilizer complex for use as feedstock
and fuel and to serve other industrial users) is lagging somewhat due in
part to the difficulty that Pertamina has had in working with the consultants
that it has selected.
Current estimates of capital cost show an increase of about
15 percent over the Appraisal Report figures. Part I shows an increase of
between 5 and 10 percent, largely due to currency revaluations and charges
made necessary as detailed design progressed and the true composition of
the gas supply became known. Part II has been enlarged to increase trans-
mission of gas, in part to meet the increased needs of the fertilizer complex
but also to supply a greatly increased (75 percent) usage by Pertamina for
its refineries and by power plants. This has increased the cost of Part II
by about 55 percent, but has lowered the cost of gas to the fertilizer
complex.
Current estimates indicate that these factors will result
in increased foreign exchange costs of US$11.5 million equivalent, inclu-
ding contingencies and a potential bonus for the general contractor if
he completes the facilities ahead of the agreed schedule. In accordance
with its loan agreement with the co-lenders, the Government is responsible
for covering the additional financing required to complete both parts of
the project.
Despite the capital cost increases the project continues to
have a satisfactory economic rate of return and would again be recommended
as a suitable basis for an IDA credit.

Comments on the progress of this project are the same as
Credit No. 155 above. The managerial problems are, however, not so acute.
Cr. No. 195   Irrigation Rehabilitation II;  US$1805 Million Credit of June 15,
1970; Closing Date: November 30 1976.
There were initial delays in disbursement on this project,
due to difficulties in establishing a new project authority and in following
procurement procedures.  However, construction contracts have now been awarded
and disbursements are progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 210 Telecommunications Expansion; US$12.8 Million Credit of July 13,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974.
After a slow start due to procurement difficulties the project
is now progressing satisfactorily. Orders for all equipment, except the tro-
pospheric scatter system,   have been placed.  The management consultants
retained to study the telecommunications authority and recommend remedial
measures have completed their work and have also been retained to implement
the recommendations.
Cr. No. 211   Fisheries;  US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970;   Closin
Date: June 3(0 1976.
This project iLs about one year behind the original implementation
schedule and disbursements are low. The prinecipal cause for the delay has
been the unsatisfactory management and engineering assistance. Arrangements
with new engineering consultants have been concluded and proposals for
improved management assistanice to the project are being considered by the
Government.  Prospects for successful project implementation remain good.

Date: December 31, 1976
Implementation of this project fell a year behind schedule
due to delays in the Government's evaluation of consultants and to uncertainties
regarding the liab-lity of foreign contractors and consultants for Indonesian
income tax. A contract wit]h consultants was signed in June 19729 and the
project is now progressing satisfactorily.

Necessary rehabilitation of. irrigation works has been found
to be much more extensive than originally esti-mated. To allow credit
disbursements to be continue(d throughout the project execution period, the
disbursement rate for civil works contracts has been lowered. While the pro-
ject is behind the original schedule, major contracts are now being awarded
and disbursements are expected to increase rapidly. Despite the delays and
cost increase, the project remains econom,ically justified.
Cr. No. 246   Seeds; US$7.5 Million Credit of May 19, 1971;   Closing
Date:  September 30, 1977.
Progress of this project has been hampered by delays in the
