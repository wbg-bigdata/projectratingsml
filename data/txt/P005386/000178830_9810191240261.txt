I. THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Socio-Economic Background
1.01      Economic and social policies in Morocco in the 1960s were markedly
conservative and led to slow economic growth and widening disparities in
the distribution of income. New policy orientations emphasizing the equal
importance of faster economic growth and a more equitable distribution
of its benefits were set out in the 1973-77 plan. The plan called for
export-led growth concentrated in the manufacturing and mining sectors and
expansion of rainfed agriculture and tourism. A high target growth rate
for GDP (real terms) of 7.5% p.a. was set for the plan period and actual
achievement is expected to be 7.3% p.a. This rate is a significant improve-
ment on the previous decade when growth averaged 3.6% p.a. in real terms.
The plan also emphasized expansion of the social sectors, particularly
education, and improvement in the distribution of income. Within the edu-
cation sector, significant progress has been made with total enrollments
increasing at over 8% p.a. in the plan period.
1.02.     The interim plan for 1978-80, although reflecting less optimistic
economic conditions, is expected to continue to emphasize economic growth
and the distribution of its benefits. The export sector will again receive
priority. However for the next few years, the social sectors will be subject
to the constraints on public expenditure brought about by falling export
prices (especially for phosphates), rising military expenditures and increased
public debt service. Nevertheless the education sector will continue to
receive high priority as indicated by its prominence in the 1978 budget.
1.03.     The population of Morocco (estimated at 18.8 million in 1978) is
distributed largely according to the clictates of topography and climate with
most people occupying the cities and rich agricultural plains of the central
and northwest regions. Population density in 1976 was estimated at 60-140
persons per km2 in the four provinces of the north and west compared with
about 15 in the three provinces of the south and east. Sparse population
ensures that the provision of education facilities in the latter is both
difficult and expensive, leading to inequalities in the distribution of
educational opportunities (para. 1.14). Population is currently growing at
the high rate of 3.0% p.a. and high fertility rates are expected to sustain
this growth rate until the 1990s, thereby maintaining pressure on the educa-
tion system for continued rapid expansion. Migration to the urban areas has
continued at a significant rate with t:he urban population accounting for an
estimated 40% of the total in 1978 comapared with 29% in 1960. Migration
overseas for employment has not been quantitatively significant according to
available data with an average of arotnd 23,000 workers departing per annum
between 1973 and 1977. However, the economic impact of workers' remittances
remains important -- estimated at over $600 million in 1977. Although
little is known about the skill structure of migrating Moroccans, present
skill shortages are undoubtedly being exacerbated by the outflow.



- 2 -
1.04.     Employment in Morocco increased at an estimated 3.4% p.a. during
the plan period 1973-77 or at about the same rate as the growth of the labor
force. Agriculture is still the major, though declining, source of employ-
ment, accounting for an estimated 47% of employment in 1977 compared with 67%
in 1960. Employment growth in the secondary and tertiary sectors (estimated
at 7.1% and 5.7% p.a. in 1971-77) was probably sufficient to stabilize the
level of unemployment rather than reduce it in this period. Unemployment is
estimated at around 10% with unmeasured but significarnt underemployment in
the rural areas. Although the government has implemerLted some measures (land
distribution, public works programs and assistance to handicrafts) aimed at
reducing unemployment there has been a clear tendency to favor capital in-
tensive methods of production. Investment incentives need to be changed to
encourage labor intensive projects if the employment needs of a rapidly
increasing population and a steady urban migration are to be met.
Education Development and Policy
1.05.     Demographic factors have played an important role in the recent
development of Morocco's education system. The high growth rate of population
is resulting in an increasingly youthful population and the pressure of social
demand has caused the education system to expand rapidly at all levels in
recent years. During the period 1971-77 primary enro]lments increased at 6%
p.a., secondary enrollments at nearly 10% p.a., while enrollments in the
universities increased 3.5 times. Gross enrollment ratios have now reached
quite reasonable levels for a country at Morocco's stage of development, being
65% for primary (7-11 years), 21% for lower secondary (12-15 years), 11% for
upper secondary (16-18 years) and 4% for higher education.
1.06.     The enrollment targets of the 1973-77 plan have been exceeded in the
primary and secondary schools, although in the latter the planned shift of
enrollments from letters to math/science and technica] courses has not been
achieved. Enrollment targets in the teacher training colleges have also been
exceeded although it now seems that primary teacher needs were underestimated
and a rapid expansion of primary teacher training is planned in the next few
years (para 1.10). Progress towards reducing repeater rates at the primary
level has been slow and although secondary repeater rates are not appreciably
above plan targets, they are nevertheless still high (para 1.13). Moroccani-
zation of the primary teaching service has been achieved and it seems certain
that lower cycle secondary will be fully moroccanized by the target year
1980.
1.07.     Education policies for the future will continue to be directed
towards long term goals namely:
(a) the expansion of primary education to provicde complete enrollment
of the seven year age group by 1995;
(b) arabization--the continued expansion of Arabic as the language
of instruction, especially at the secondary level in science and
technical courses;



- 3 -
(c) moroccanization of the teaching service. This is complete at
the primary level and it is planned to have the lower secondary
level fully moroccanized by 1980;
(d)  the de-elopment of secondary and higher education to meet the
country's needs for skilled manpower through the expansion of
secondary technical education, higher institutes of technology
and a greater orientation towards science and engineering in the
universities;
1.08.     Education is being given high priority in Morocco in accordance
with its key role in the country's development. In general, educational
policies have been soundly conceived and are relevant to long term objectives.
Administration of the education system has been strengthened recently with the
amalgamation of the Ministries of Primary and Secondary Education and Higher
Education to form the Ministry of National Education and Training. This
brings policy formulation for the whole formal education system under one
minister who is served by two secretaries of state. The new ministry also
contains a directorate of training, under strong leadership, which will
coordinate the post-secondary training activities of other ministries. At the
commune level, the policy of giving more responsibility for the management of
primary schools to local government authorities will ensure a closer relation-
ship between education and the social environment.
1.09.     The problems of the education system (paras. 1.12-1.18) are well
understood in Morocco, but their solution will be long term. The gradual
generalization of primary schooling will progressively reduce inequalities
of opportunity between sexes and regions, while arabization will reduce the
language disadvantages now suffered by poorer children. More relevant curri-
cula in primary and secondary schools, to be achieved through increased
teaching of science and technical subjects, improved teach-ing aids and better
qualified teachers will, in the long run, help to reduce repeater and dropout
rates. Expansion of secondary technical schooling and higher technical and
scientific education will increase t'he supply of crucially short skilled
manpower.
1.10.     However the pursuit of these policies will place an increasing
burden on teacher training, particularly at the primary level and ultimately
on the national budget.  In 1977, there were only 4,500 students enrolled in
primary teacher training colleges producing an output of around 2100 and this
is highly inadequate in terms of teacher needs, estimated at 4,900 p.a. to
1990. This deficiency has been recognized by the government and the capacity
of the primary teacher training system will be raised to 14,000 places by
1982. The supply of teachers at the lower secondary level is being met
adequately by the system of regional teachers' colleges (enrollments 8,053
in 1977). Upper secondary teachers are drawn from university graduates who
follow a one year teacher training course at the Ecole Normale Superieure
(enrollments 219 in 1977). To increase supply, the government has introduced
a special one-year course to upgrade teachers with suitable experience and



- 4 -
academic potential. 1/ A program for the construction of eight ecoles
normales superieures is also currently under consideration with priority to
be given to the training of math/science teachers in four year courses.
1.11.     In terms of overall financial resources, education and training
currently accounts for a high 6.3% of GNP and this level of effort is expected
to be maintained to 1990 (para. 1.22). Clearly, the government will need to
exercise a high degree of cost consciousness in the future and emphasize
measures to reduce unit recurrent capital costs in order to keep the burden
of education within acceptable limits.
Education Issues
1.12.     While total enrollments at all levels have expanded rapidly in
recent years, growth has been accompanied by significant qualitative problems.
They are:
(a) Efficiency
1.13.     Despite improvements in recent years repeater and dropout rates
are still high.  In the primary cycle, 31% repeat and nearly 6% drop out,
while in secondary the rates are about 16% and 7% respectively. In 1977,
98,000 or 26% of grade 1 enrollments were repeaters while 13,000 or 12%
were repeating grade 6. Thus about one in four primary places and one in
eight secondary places normally available to new admissions were preempted
by repeaters. Examination success rates are low with only 33% passing
the secondary entrance exam and 44% receiving the baccalaureat. These
qualitative deficiencies are caused by a number of factors including socio-
economic pressures for early termination of schooling, irrelevant curricula
and lack of textbooks and teaching; aids and, at the primary level in
particular, language problens and a shortage of qualified teachers. Within
the university system the situation is even more serious with dropout rates
of between 25% and 43% and repeater rates of 30%-53% for first year students.
Only 30% of candidates received the licence in 1977.
(b) Equity
1.14.     Marked disparities in educational opportunity by sex and region
continue to exist. The proportion of girls enrolled in primary schools
was only 36% of total enrollments in 1977, barely an improvement over the
33% recorded in 1970. At the same time, urban girls have a much better
chance of entering school than their rural counterparts--46% of new primary
enrollments in urban areas were girls compared with 23% in rural areas.
Regionally, 39% of primary enrollments are female in the north-west while the
proportion is only 19% in the sout:hern region. At the secondary level girls
accounted for only 35% of total enrollments in general secondary schools in
1/   The capacity of the special course is being increased under the third
education project (Loan 1220-MOR) which is financing a training institu-
tion for 275 trainees.



1977 although this is an improvement over the 26% enrolled in 1970.  Within
technical secondary schools only 22% of enrollments are girls. Marked
regional disparities by sex also occur at the secondary level with girls
accounting for 38% of total enrollments in the north-west region compared
with less than 20% in the southern region. In primary teacher training,
female enrollment has reached 44% but declines to 22% in lower secondary
teacher training. In the universities only 20% of enrollments are female.
(c) Language
1.15.     The continued widespread use of French as the language of instruc-
tion together with the slow rate of arabization of the curriculum have posed
serious problems within the school system. The introduction of French in
grade 3 and its increasing use thereafter has raised learning difficulties
for children from poorer homes who lack contact with the language outside the
school environment. This in turn has contributed to increased repeater and
dropout rates.  Tardiness in producing textbooks and teaching aids in Arabic
as well as teachers capable of teaching in the language have held up arabiza-
tion in both primary and secondary levels, although in the former, the teacher
service is fully moroccanized. At the secondary level, arabization has
commenced in history, geography and philosophy but progress will continue
to be hampered in science and technical courses by the lack of textbooks in
Arabic and the high proportion of non-Moroccans (35%) in the teaching force.
(d) Relevance
1.16.     Primary education has a strcng literary bias which is similarly
reflected in the secondary schools and universities.  Thus the two-thirds
of primary school leavers who do not enter secondary school have received an
education which has scant relevance te life after school or the need to find
gainful employment. About 60% of teaching time in the lower secondary cycle
is devoted to letters but an attempt is being made to make learning more
practical through the establishment of the "introduction to technology" course
(para. 2.06). Within the upper cycle of the general secondary schools, 49% of
enrollments are in letters compared with 47% in science and 4% in technical
and commercial courses. At the universities, the pattern is much exacerbated
with nearly 77% of students enrolled in law and arts compared with 9% in
science and 1% in engineering. Over the past five years, 61% of graduates
have come from the faculties of law and arts and if these trends continue
Morocco will soon have a surplus of non-technical graduates posing future pro-
blems of high level underemployment arid unemployment.  To make the university
system more relevant to the country's high level manpower needs, a substantial
reallocation of resources is needed irn favor of science and engineering
courses.
(e) Manpower Training Problems
1.17.     Shortages of skilled and experienced manpower in Morocco have acted
as a serious constraint to economic and social development.  At the higher
levels shortages have been alleviated by the employment of large numbers of
expatriates but this constitutes merely a temporary and costly expedient and



-6-
should not obscure the urgent need to develop local sources of manpower
supply. Development of higher education has favored the universities, which
in 1977 had enrollments of 45,000, rather than the higher institutes of
technology (enrollment 6,000). Within the universities, as noted in para.
1.16, there exists a strong bias towards arts and law courses suggesting the
need for a redirection of resources in favor of science and engineering
courses in the universities and towards the non-university institutes of
technology. The problem is recognized in current policies for the development
of higher education which call for the establishment of four institutes of
technology, two applied engineering institutes, a school of architecture, the
extension to Mohammedia Engineering College and three faculties of science.
It is not clear at this stage whether policies for the restructuring of
university enrollments in favor of science/engineering courses will be at the
expense of resources allocated to arts/law courses or whether these will
continue to expand and additional resources made available for expansion in
science and engineering. If the latter is intended, it will cause additional
pressure on an already high education budget.
1.18.     At the middle and lower levels, shortages are particularly crucial
and the training infrastructure inadequate. Technical secondary schools
enroll only one student for every 13 in general secondary schools. In the
non-formal sector the artisanat training scheme covering 15 trades enrolls
only about 4,000 trainees; training in Ministry of Labor vocational schools
(8,200 enrollments including 3,600 in six month courses), health training
(4,500), agriculture (1,500) and tourism (1,200) service the other major
fields of middle and lower manpower demand and outputs from the system are
estimated to meet only about one third of requirements. Apart from quantita-
tive inadequacies, vocational training undertaken in different ministries
suffers qualitative deficiencies resulting from a shortage of trained in-
structors and teaching materials and has lacked a coordinating mechanism
comparable to the Directorate of Training recently established to serve this
purpose for post-secondary training (para. 1.08). 1/ At the lowest level,
pre-employment training in six month courses enrolls 3,600 trainees. These
courses provide the first opportunity for training to those who may not
have completed primary schooling but since even the simplest formal courses
require at least some primary education, the 35% of the age group who do not
attend primary school, together with older illiterates, are excluded entirely
from future training opportunities. The need for literacy programs and
expanded low level skill training is therefore an obvious priority. The
1973-77 plan called for the establishment of the National Bureau of Literacy
within the Ministry of Education with an interministerial commission to
coordinate its work. However the Bureau has not been established and the
plan target of giving some literacy training to 2.5 million illiterates
remains unmet.
1/   The situation is expected to improve following a recent decision to
make the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training responsible for
coordinating all lower technical/vocational training.



-7-
Technical Manpower Requirements
1.19.     The achievement of Morocco's hopes for a rapidly growing and
modernizing economy rests to a great extent on the availability of skilled
technical manpower. Reliance on expatriates to fill crucial gaps in manpower
demand is both very costly and incompatible with the long term needs of a
self-reliant economy and society. Technically trained Moroccans are needed
in large numbers to fill high level technical posts, to assume managerial
responsibility and at the middle leve:L to meet the requirements for tech-
nicians to operate and maintain increasingly complex systems of production.
The structure of the education system in Morocco does not serve well the
country's needs for technical manpower. At the upper secondary and higher
levels, enrollments are strongly biased in favor of non-technical courses
and the accompanying table indicates clearly the highly inadequate supply
of technical manpower at the present time. Education policies for the future
emphasize strongly the need to develop middle and higher technical education
and the fourth education project that is described in this report will make a
significant contribution to this objective.

1.20.      The inadequacy of basic data in Morocco has made estimates of
future technical manpower needs difficult and figures should be regarded
only as general orders of magnitude.  Nevertheless the gap between estimated
annual requirements and current output demonstrates the general dimension
of the manpower shortage in Morocco. It is estimated that annual requirements
for engineers in Morocco during 1977-90 will be 1,740 p.a. of which 580 will
be "ingenieurs d'etat" (five year course) and 1,160 "ingenieurs d'application"
(four year course) compared with a current output for both categories of
387.1/ Requirements for higher engineering technicians in the same period
are estimated at 4,400 p.a while outputs were only 407 in 1977. Middle level
technical manpower requirements are expected to average 11,700 industrial
technicians p.a. and 13,500 commercial technicians. Outputs of these cate-
gories in 1977 were 1,499 and 3,906 respectively.
1.21.      The project institutions would make a signil icant contribution to
the long term requirements for teclanical manpower in Morocco and an especially
important contribution to the planned expansion of the higher education
system. The extension to Mohammedia would raise its enrollment capacity f rom
535 to 2,200 and an annual output of around 400 ingenieurs d'etat could be
expected. The applied engineering college, with an estimated output of 190
p.a. is one of two to be established and current proposals also call for the
establishment of four higher institutes of technology, the first of their
kind under the Ministry of National Education. The project would finance two
of these which together would graduate 550 higher teclhnicians a year at full
capacity. The 11 technical lycees would more than double current capacity
and would eventually graduate 2,180 engineering technicians and 1,020 commer-
cial technicians per year. The majority of graduates are expected to enter
direct employment to ease the critical shortage of middle level technicians.
The technical teacher training college would play a major role in supporting
the expansion of technical education by providing 240 technical teachers a
year or 77% of estimated annual average needs.
Education Finance
1.22.      Expenditures on education in Morocco have reflected the rapid rate
of growth of enrollments at all levels in recent years. Overall enrollments
increased at around 8% p.a. betweEtn 1973 and 1977 and this educational effort
has imposed an increasing burden on the economy with total public expenditure
on education, as a proportion of GNP, rising from 4.2% in 1972 to 6.3% in
1976. Assuming that education continues to receive high priority in national
development, current trends indicate that education will account for around
the same proportion of GNP by 1990. Although the burden of educational
expenditures is not expected to increase appreciably, it is nevertheless
quite high for a country at Morocco's stage of development and it emphasizes
the need for close control of educational expenditures.  In 1973-77, recurrent
costs in primary and secondary education rose at arotnd 10.5% p.a. due mainly
1/   Output figures do not include Moroccan graduates of overseas institu-
tions. In 1977 there were 773 Moroccans studying engineering and
technical courses overseas.

to increases in teachers' salaries. There are clear opportunities for lower-
ing unit costs through raising the relatively low internal efficiency of
the school system.  The government is expected to exercise close control over
boarding and scholarship costs and teachers' salaries, which account for 85%
of recurrent expenditures in primary and secondary education. Furthermore,
substantial savings are expected to accrue through the moroccanization of the
secondary teaching service which is currently 35% expatriate. The ongoing
effort to improve school location planning will continue as a matter of
priority and every effort will be made to reduce unit construction costs and
ensure appropriate space standards in educational facilities.
Bank Strategy and Lending for Educatien
1.23.     Growth, modernization and self-reliance within Morocco will place
a particularly heavy responsibilitv ori the education and training system to
improve the general educational level of the population and especially to
produce the skilled manpower required to achieve Morocco's long term develop-
ment objectives.  Education policies in Morocco have been directed towards
these ends by emphasizing the generalization of primary education, moroccan-
ization, arabization, and expansion of secondary and higher education to meet
manpower needs. Nevertheless quantitative expansion has been accompanied by
qualitative deficiencies especially inL the form of low internal efficiency
and lack of relevance of teaching to national needs (paras. 1.13 and 1.16).
1.24.     Bank lending in the education sector (two credits and one loan)
has been consistent with the government's objectives and the need to mitigate
the problems of the education system. Lending has concentrated on: (a)
expansion and qualitative improvement of secondary education as a basis for
producirg urgently needed manpower; (b) the expansion of teacher training in
support of the policy of moroccanization; (c) the expansion of manpower
training capacity in specific priority sectors (agriculture,health
and tourism); and (d) support for more relevant and equitably distributed
rural education through the construction of experimental primary schools in
the most deprived rural areas. The first credit (79-MOR for US$ 11 million)
in 1965 provided for the construction and equipment of 21 secondary schools
(three were later deleted) offering a mix of general academic and vocationally
oriented short courses. The latter were never implemented following a
government reform which abolished vocational courses in the formal education
system and thus the impact of the project was reduced. There were also
substantial delays in implementation due to poor project management in the
early stages. Implementation was in the hands of part-time officials; weak
decision making capability and cumbersome disbursement procedures also con-
tributed to the delays. The situation steadily improved following the crea-
tion of a separate, permanently staffed project unit as specified in the
second credit agreement.
1.25.     The second credit (266-MOR for US$ 8.5 million) in 1971 provided
strong support for teacher training through the establishment of seven teacher
training colleges and the qualitative improvement of science and technical
teaching through the provision of science laboratories for 6 general sec-
ondary schools, and equipment for 10 technical and 13 commercial schools.



- 10 -
Construction and equipment were also provided in support of forestry training.
Implementation of this project proceeded satisfactorily and is now complete.
The third project (Loan 1220-T-MOR for US$ 25 million) in 1976 continued
support for manpower training in specific sectors (agriculture, health and
tourism), secondary education and teacher training ancd also provided 47
primary schools with practically oriented curricula to increase educational
opportunities and the relevance of primary schooling in rural reas.  Imple-
mentation of this project is proceeding satisfactorily.
1.26.     The proposed fourth education project concentrates on meeting
Morocco's crucial needs for technicians and engineers and training technical
teachers. This project is vLewed as a specifie effort: in middle and higher
technical education to relieve Morocco's severe shortages of technical man-
power. Future lending is expected to emphasize lower level training needs
for particular priority sectors (such as agriculture and health) and voca-
tional training for industry with emphasis on skill upgrading for the poor.
With regard to the latter, areas for future Bank lend-ing will be identified
in a study of lower level vocational and technical training being financed
under the third project.
II. THE PROJECT
Introduction
2.01      The proposed project was prepared by the Moroccan government, in
part by means of engineering studies financed under the third education
project.l/ Bank pre-preparation missions visited Morocco in June and October
1977 and a Moroccan preparation mission came to Washington in November 1977.
A Unesco mission assisted in project preparation in Jianuary 1978. The project
(loan amount $113 million) was appraised by Messrs. W.E. Rees (economist,
mission leader), A. Andonyadis (architect), J.C. Jones (technical educator,
consultant) and R. Dugre (engineering educator, consultant) during February 13
- March 10, 1978. The government presented a list of nine prepared items of
which five were appraised in line with government and Bank priorities and the
limit imposed by the estimated loan amount. Slow progress in design develop-
ment necessitated further visits by the mission architect in November 1978
and January 1979 and has led to a considerable delay in finalizing project
documents.
Objectives and Scope
2.02      The project is designed to increase the supply of (a) middle and
higher technicians and engineers to meet Morocco's urgent demand for these
uianpower categories; and (b) technical teachers for the expanding system
of technical lycees and for the "introduction to tec'nnology" program in
1/   The engineering studies were for five technical Lycees, the technical
teacher training college and the applied engineering institute.

the general lycees. The project institutions would be located in accordance
with government policies for decentralized development and the need to dis-
perse training opportunities among regional centers of development. The
project would comprise:
(a)  Construction, furniture and equipment for:

(b)  Technical assistance related to (i) - (iv) above (20 man-years of
experts and 1-1/3 man-years of fellowships).
(c)  Technical assistance for the project implementation unit (8 man-
years).
(d)  Pre-investment designs for the preparation of a future education
project.
(a)  Technical Lycees
2.03      The project would provide for the construction and equipment of Il
technical lycees offering three-year industrial and commercial courses at the
upper-secondary level (grades 10-12). Outputs are estimated at 2,180 indus-
trial and 1,020 commercial technicians. The courses are designed with
specific reference to the needs of industry and commerce for middle-level
technicians and it is expected that a majority (85-90%) of graduates would
seek such employment with the remainder enterîng higher technical education.
Individual choice in this respect is likely to be influenced by the favorable
employment conditions offered by indlustry and commerce and by the relative
scarcity of bursaries and places in higher technical education. Entry to the
technical lycee is open to those wit:h good passing marks in appropriate
subjects in grade 9. All courses are open to women but relatively few are
expected to enroll in industrial courses. A much more significant female
enrollment is anticipated in the commercial courses, especially those prepar-
ing for secretarial work. Boarding for about 6,000 students would be financed
under the loan reflecting the need to serve students from poorer homes and to
draw inputs from beyond the centers of population in which the institutions
are to be located. These locations reflect both the government's policy



- 12 -
of decentralizing education/training opportunities in accordance with regional
development needs and the specific regional needs of industry and commerce for
technicians.
2.04      Curricula reflect the need for practical preparation of technicians
and have an adequate balance between laboratory/workshop programs and theoret-
icai studies.  The industrial course offers four options (industrial produc-
tion, design, electrotechnics and electronies) and in iive schools an addi-
tional option in industrial chemistry is provided to reflect regional needs
for technicians to serve the chemical industry. The commercial course offers
options in accountancy and secretarial studies. The sitatute under which the
technical lycees would be established requires the creation of advisory
councils, representative of local industrial and commercial interests and the
government will establish them within six months of thie opening of the insti-
tutions. The councils would be responsible for ensuring the relevance of
training to local labor market needs, the placing of students in employment
training during vacations and career guidance. Councils would also be respon-
sible for the management of funds raised from a training tax 1/ and used for
the purchase of materials, maintenance of workshops and the payment of part-
time teachers drawn from local enterprises.
2.05      An academic staff of about 80 would be needed for each technical
lycee. Considerable reliance on expatriates recruited under existing bila-
teral agreements with France and Belgium would be necessary during the first
years of operation until the outputs of the proposed technical teacher
training college become available. Technical assistance (about 5 man-years)
would be required for course/equipmLent specialists and a small number of
fellowships to provide counterparts to these experts (para. 2.21).
(b) Regional Technical Teacher Training College
2.06      This institution would be established on a suitable site at Mohamme-
dia and would serve two purposes: (a) to train teachers for the "introduction
to technology" course in the lower cycle of general secondary schools and (b)
to train teachers for the expanding system of technical lycees. The introduc-
tion to technology course was instituted during the 1973-77 plan as part of
the policy to place greater emphasis on science and technology in general
secondary education. Teaching of the course is currently restricted by the
availability of only 116 technology teachers who have been trained in tempo-
rary facilities at Casablanca. It is intended that the course be extended to
all general secondary schools to provide two hours of instruction per week in
each of the four years of the lower cycle. For technical lycee teachers, no
formal training currently exists in Morocco.  Of the present stock of nearly
600 technical teachers, about 60% are expatriates and the Moroccan teachers
are drawn directly from industry or from university graduates who have com-
pleted a one-year course at the Ecole Normale Superieur. Almost all of the
latter teach the basic math/science courses.
1/   The training tax is levied at a rate of 1% of payroll on enterprises
with more than 10 employees.



-- 13 -
2.07       The proposed training college would provide a two years course for
lower cycle technology teachers and a three years course for upper cycle
technical lycee teachers. The two-year course would enroll 180 students who
would follow a well-balanced program covering technical and general subjects
and teaching methods. The three-year course would enroll 480 students who
would take a year's common course followed by specializations in one of the
six options offered in the technical lycees (para. 2.04).l/ Entry to both
courses would be by means of an entrance exam for holders of an appropriate
baccalaureate. All courses and options would be open to women but it is
expected that significant female enrollment would be achieved only in the
secretarial option. An advisory council would be established with appropriate
industry representation. Boarding for 450 students would be financed under
the loan.
2.08       At full capacity the training college would graduate about 85
technology teachers which would allow for the steady expansion of enrollments
in the introduction to technology colurse. Annual outputs of around 155
technical teachers would be sufficient to staff two or three new technical
lycees per year and in addition would allow for the progressive replacement
of expatriates. For the training college itself, 83 academic staff would
be required including about 60 expatriates. Technical assistance (5 man-
years) would be needed for course/equipment specialists during the start-up
period in 1983-84.
(c) Higher Institutes of Technology
2.09      The proposed project would finance two higher institutes of technol-
ogy to provide a two year course for higher engineering technicians. The
institutes would be located at Casablanca, Morocco's largest industrial
city and at Fez, a center for the textile industry which is also near the oil
and sugar refining industries located around Sidi Kacem. Each institute would
enroll 576 students and offer specializations in mechanical, electrical,
electronic, civil and chemical engineering. Curricula adequately reflect the
needs of industry and provide an acceptable balance between practical and
theoretical studies.  Entry to courses would be by examination open to suit-
able baccalaureates.  All courses would be open to women and a target female
enrollment of 20% has been set.  However this target is unlikely to be met in
the first few years of operation in view of the present low level (3.7%) of
female enrollment in similar courses. Boarding for 432 students in each
institute would be financed under the loan.
2.10      At full capacity, each institute would require 56 academic staff
recruited entirely from Moroccan sources. Technical assistance (5 man-years)
would be required only for course/equipment specialists during the start-up
period in 1983-84. Part-time faculty drawn from industry are expected to play
an important teaching role and serve to develop links with local enterprises.
These links would be further strengthened by the creation of an advisory
council for each institution with strong industry representation.
1/   No specific training is offered for industrial chemistry because the
number of teachers is small anc[ would be drawn from industry or the
universities.



- 14 -
(d) National Institute of Applied Engineering
2.11      The National Institute of Applied Engineering would provide a four
year program for "ingenieurs d'application". These are engineers with a
practical orientation who are closely involved in the production process
and supervise the work of technicians. Their training must provide technical
knowledge and skills combined with sufficient theoretical knowledge to
implement decisions and make independent judgments in an operational setting.
The ingenieur d'application provides the link in the technical manpower
structure between the research/design engineer (ingenieur d'Etat) and the
practical work undertaken by higher and middle technicians. The program
would extend over eight semesters of sixteen weeks, each of 32 hours. It
would offer a common first year followed by engineering specializations
in civil, electrical, mechanical and metallurgy. Curricula are well balanced
between basic sciences, socio-economic and technology subjects, the latter
constituting 67% of the program. Entry to the program would be open to
scientific and technical baccalaureates and persons with equivalent qualifi-
cations. The goal for female enrollment has been set at 20%, but it is
unlikely to be achieved in the first few years of operation. Boarding for
768 students would be financed under the loan.
2.12      The Institute would be located at Casablance on a suitable site
capable of future expansion. When fully operational the Institute would
require 74 faculty recruited entirely from Moroccan sources. Technical
assistance (5 man-years) would be needed for course/equipment specialists
during the start-up period in 1983-84.  It is expected that part-time faculty
drawn from industry and government agencies in Casablanca would make an
important practical contribution to the teaching program and links with
these sectors would be further strengthened by the appointment of an advisory
council with strong industry representation.
(e)  Mohammedia Engineering College Extension
2.13       The Mohammedia Engineering College was established in 1960 to
provide a three year engineering diploma. The program was upgraded to a
four-year ingenieur d'application degree in 1962 and further upgraded in
1970 to provide a five year ingenieur d'Etat program. The ingenieur d'Etat
is a full professional engineer whose training is oriented towards design,
planning, research and management. Training for this role must impart a
high degree of technical and theoretical knowledge as well as an understand-
ing of socio-economic and environmental issues to develop a broader viewpoint
and enable the engineer to make decisions that exten,i beyond purely technical
considerations. Additional specializations or options are not envisaged
in the proposed expansion of enrollments at Mohammedia. The site for the
extension is part of the existing campus. The existing buildings will
accommodate the two year common course forming a school of basic studies
(plus the College administration) and the extension will accommodate the
four specialist departments. Additional boarding accommodation would be
provided by the Government.



- 15 -
2.14       The five-year program at Mohammedia extends over 10 semesters of
15 weeks, each of 32 hours and offers four engineering specializations (civil,
electrical, mechanical and mining) with 12 options. Curricula are well
balanced providing for a common course during the first two years which
emphasizes mathiematics, science and languages. Specializations in the last
three years are well-adapted to actual engineering practice and include social
science and management subjects.  Entry to the course is by means of a selec-
tion committee process open to scientific and technical baccalaureates and
others with equivalent qualifications.  The goal for femaLe enrollment is 20%
and on current trends this seems feasible; females comprised 13% of enrollments
in first year in 1977-78.
2.15       Mohammedia currently has an enrollment of 535 and it is proposed
under the project to expand enrollment capacity to 2,200. This is the major
institution training ingenieurs d'Etat in Morocco and 67 are expected to
graduate in 1978. This compares wiL-h annual average requirements of 580
p.a. in the period to 1990. When fully operational, Mohammedia is expected
to produce 400 graduates thus accounting for 70% of long term annual require-
ments. Mohammedia would require a Ibigh-quality faculty of- 275 (including
about 100 expatriates) when fully operational compared with the current figure
of 54. No Bank financed technical assistance is required for this project
item.
Evaluation System
2.16       To assist in ensuring thal: the outputs of the project institutions
would be adequately trained in relation to industry's neecis and would secure
employment in jobs for which they had been trained, a tracer system would be
established for each institution.  'En addition, the tracer systems would
contribute to improving vocational guidance, career evaluation and curriculum
development in the longer term.  The government has agreed to operate the
tracer systems from the opening of each institution and to submit details of
these systems to the Bank at least 1]2 months before the opening of the new
institutes, to permit review and comment and that results of the tracer
studies would be forwarded to the Bank for five years following the first
outputs from the institutions, as required for project evaluation.
Teacher Requirements
2.17       Moroccanization of the teaching service is a long term objective
which is planned for completion in about 10 years. In the meantime, suffi-
cient numbers of expatriate teachers would continue to be recruited under
existing bilateral aid arrangements with France and Belgium. The government
foresees no difficulty in meeting teacher needs for the project institutions
under the bilateral arrangements. These are of long-standing duration and
work efficiently to supply a significant proportion of the teaching force in
secondary and higher education in Morocco. In 1976-77 there were nearly 6,200
French teachers in the general secorndary schools, over 400 in the universities
(excluding an unknown number of short term visiting academics), with perhaps
another 500 in the technical schools and institutes.



- 16 -
2.18      The proposed project institutions would require about 1,470 teachers
at full capacity of which about 700 would be expatriate. The bulk of these
requirements would be accounted for by the technical lycees which would need
about 900 teachers including about 550 expatriates. Moroccan teachers of
basic science and math courses in the technical lycees would be drawn from the
universities and limited numbers of teachers of technical subjects recruited
from industry and government. From 1986 onwards, outputs from the proposed
technical teacher training college would make an increasing contribution to
staffing the technical lycees. In addition, fellowships would be offered to
train Moroccan teaching staff for the post-secondary project institutions and
these would be financed under existing bilateral agreements.
2.19      The government has prepared a staff development plan for each insti-
tution which identifies the numbers of local and expatriate teaching and
administrative staff that will be required each year during the first ten
years of operation, together with the numbers and types of fellowships that
would be requested per year from bilateral sources. In addition, the govern-
ment has provided an assurance that the required expatriate teachers and
fellowships, consistent with the staff development plans agreeable to the
Bank, would be given the highest priority in the government's requests to
bilateral agencies for assistance during the period of these staff development
plans or until the relevant institution's staff is completely moroccanized,
whichever is earlier.
Technical Assistance
2.20      Bank financed technical assistance for the project would be required
(a) for the project institutions (with the exception of Mohammedia) during the
crucial start-up period; and (b) for the project implementation unit to
strengthen its technical staff.  A. total of 28 man-years of experts and 1-1/3
man-years of fellowships would be needed. Details of the technical assistance
program are shown in Annex 1, Table 2.1.
2.21      For the institutions the main need (20 man-years) is for course/
equipment specialists to supervise the installation of equipment and ensure
adequate training of local technical staff in the operation and maintenance
of equipment. The experts would also be required for the preparation of
workshop and laboratory teaching programs. In general the experts would be
needed for a period of 16 months each commencing about six months before
the start-up date and remaining for a full academic year. To establish a
permanent group of experts in equipment maintenance for the technical lycee
system, 16 man-months of fellowships would be requiretd to train four Moroccans
abroad in association with the experts.
2.22      In order to handle the additional heavy workload related to the
administration and supervision of designs and construction of the proposed
project, the technical services of the project implementation unit would
be strengthened through the emplovment of an expert engineer and an
expert architect until completion of the project. Two Moroccan engineers, an
architect and two technicians have been recruited as counterpart staff.



- 17 -
A small amount of short-term expert services for the unit (about 1-1/2
man-years) which would be required for refinement of equipment lists
and specifications would be supplied by experts recruited under the third
education project.
Pre-investment Designs
2.23      The project would finance pre-investment designs for the development
of a standard workshop design for rural primary schools, secondary teacher

3.03       Basis of Cost Estimates.  Estimated civil works costs for the pro-
posed project items are based on unit prices derived from current contracts
and detailed cost analysis of completed components of the second education
project, adjusted to reflect cost differences among the various regions.
Furniture and equipment costs are based on current CIF unit prices and ad-
justed upward to include local transportation and installation. Cost esti-
mates do not include any identifiable import duties. Costs of the technical
assistance components are based on prevailing international remuneration of
specialists and cost of fellowship training abroad.
3.04       Contingency Allowance.  The project cost includes a contingency
allowance for unforeseen physical additions equal to 10% of the estimated cost
of civil works, furniture and equipment and professional fees, and 5% of the
estimated cost of technical assistance. The projecit cost also includes price
escalation contingencies calculated for the period beginning October 1, 1978
and in accordance with an agreed schedule of implementation. In view of



- 19 -
differences in prevailing rates of price escalation for local costs and
international market prices, escalatic,n contingencies were estimated sepa-
rately for local and foreign costs. E'rice escalation percentages per year for
each component of the project are listed at the bottom of Annex 1, Table 3.2.
Prices are expected to increase during the project implementation period hy a
weighted total of about 32% for civil works, 31% for furniture, 38% for
equipment, 14% for professional fees and 22%,' for technical assistance.
Accordingly, total price increases are estimated at about 32% of baseline
cost and about 23% of total estimated project cost, including contingencies.
3.05      Foreign exchange component.  The estimated foreign exchange compo-
nent is US$113.0 million equivalent or 52.2% of total project cost. The
calculations of the foreign exchange component are based on the expectation
that:  (a) all civil works contracts and professional services w'Ll. be awarded
to local or locally established mixed firms; (b) all equipment will be of
foreign origin and about 90% will be imported directly; (c) about one-half
of the furniture will be awarded to foreign suppliers; and (d) all technical
assistance will be provided from forei'gn sources. The resulting foreign
exchange content of each category of eixpenditure is as follows: (i) civil
works 39%, (ii) furniture 70%, (iii) equipment 90%, (iv) professional fees
17%, and (v) technical assistance 80%..
3.06      Project financing.  The proposed loan of US$113.0 million would
finance 100% of the total estimated foreign exchange cost of the project.
The balance of total project costs would be financed by the government.
The proposed financial plan is summari'zed below:

Recurrent Costs
3.07      lhen the project institutions are fully operational their recurrent
costs are expected to be about Dh 76 million annually, corresponding to
about 1.7% of projected public recurrent expenditure on education in 1986.
In view of the high priority of the proposed project, the government can
be expected to meet these expenditures.
Implementat ion
3.08      According to the agreed iLmplementati-n schedLules (Annex 1, Chart 2),
the physical aspects of all project items with the exception of the exten-
sion to the Mohammedia Engineering College, would be completed by Septeauber
1983.  The latter is scheduled for completion durtrivg bline 1984.  The technical
assistance programn would continue through June 1984.  In order to allow
sufficient time for submission of iinal withdrawal applications for the
last parts of the project, the Closing Date would be December 31, L984.
Administration
3.09      The project would be imp:Lemented by the Project lmpiemeut-iiv
'Tïi-. "?EU) of the Ministry of Education, which is also responsible for the
second education project and the M:Lnistry's items in the third project.
The PIU is operating efficiently and implementation of ongoing projects
is proceeding satisfactorily. However, the additional heavy workload related
to the proposed project would require strengthening the staff of the Unit
and the government has agreed to technical assistance financing in the pro-
posed project for (i) an expert mechanical/electrical engineer for five
years; and (ii) an extension of employment of the expert architect presently
financed under the third loan or of a substitute agreeable to the Bank
for the entire implementation period of the project, i.e. for three years.
Financing of a total of eight manyesars of experts is therefore included in
the project.  In addition short-term consultants in civil, electrical and
mechanical engineering, financed under the third loan but not yet utilized,
would be used to assist in preparation of equipment lists, specifications and
installatlon details of equipment in the workshops and laboratories.  The PIU
has been further strengthened by the recruitment of an additional `loroccan
architect and two engineers, to be financed by the Government.
3.10      Pedagogical and administrative inputs would be provided by the
director of each institution and in the meantime an official of the Ministry
of Education is acting as interim representative of the institution until
the director is appointed. The director of Mohammedia Engineering College
has already been appointed and is providing valuable inputs for that insti-
tution.  The Directorate of Secondary and Technical Education has designated
the interim representative for the group of Il technical lycees until the
directors are appointed. The Government has given assurances that directors
of the new project institutions would be appointed at least 12 months before
scheduled opening dates and heads of departments for ithe technical teachers'
college, the instttutes of technology and the applied engineering institute,
within nine months following opening dates.

Architects and Preliminary Designs
3.11      The Government has selected consultant architects and engineers,
acceptable to the Bank, for the design and supervision of the project insti-
tutions which were not among the institutions whose preparation was financed
under the third nrolect. The Government has agreed that special budgetary
provisions would be made to finance the cost of these consultants until the
loan becomes effective. Preliminary designs for each project institution were
reviewed during appraisal and it was agreed that they would be modified in
accordance with the appraisal mission's recommendations. Modified preliminary
architectural designs and engineering studies for the five technical lycees,
the technical teacher training colLege and the national institute of applied
engineering have been satisfactorily completed. Similar designs and studies
for the other institutions will be submitted in May 1979 with the exception of
those for Mohammedia Engineering College which are expected in July.
Sites
3.12      Suitable sites for all project institutions have been acquired and
detailed topographical surveys have been completed.
Bank Review and Approvals
3.13      Refinement of preliminary equipment lists is underway and final
lists are scheduled for completion in early 1980. The government has agreed
that bid documents would require supp]iers to provide training of key person-
nel during installation in the use ancl maintenance of sophisticated equip-
ment. An assurance has been given that an appropriate plan for equipment
inalritenance would be prepared for the project institutions and forwarded for
Bank review within one year after the opening of the institutions.
Procurement
3.14      Civil works contracts (amounting to US$136.1 million including
contingencies) would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding. Civil works contracts of less than US$200,000 equivalent, supple-
mentary to main contracts, would be awarded on the basis of local competitive
bidding procedures which are acceptab:Le to the Bank. The total contract
amount to be awarded under the latter procedures would not exceed an aggre-
gated amount of US$5.0 million. It is anticipated that due to the dispersion
of the project institutions within the country and the well developed state of
the construction industry, all civil works contracts would be awarded to local
wr, nlixed firms.
3.15      Equipment and furniture items (amounting to US$67.5 million including
contingencies) would be grouped, to the extent possible, in large packages to
permit bulk procurement. Contracts for furniture and equipment in excess of
US$50,000 would be awarded on the basis of I.C.B. Small items or groups of
items estimated to cost less than the aliove figure or items of specialized
nature for which I.C.B. would not be practical, would be procured under normal



- 22 -
government procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank, and would include,
to the extent possible, quotations from at least three manufacturers or
suppliers; these items would not exceed an aggregate total of US$4.0 million.
Draft procurement documents for furniture, equipment and civil works would be
forwarded to the Bank for review and approval; Bank approval of tender evalu-
ation documents would be required prior to the award of all contracts under
I.C.B. Bank reimbursement for all other contracts would be contingent upon
Bank approval of tender evaluation documents subsequent to contract awards.
Disbursements
3.16      Disbursements (Annex 1, Table 3.3) would be on the basis of:
(i)  Civil works:  39% of total expenditure;
(ii) Furniture and equipment: (a) 100% of foreign expenditure for
directly imported items, (b) 85% of local expenditures for
locally procured imported items, and (c) 50% of total expendi-
tures for locally manufactured items;
(iii)  Professional services:  17% of total expenditures;
(iv)  Technical assistance:  100% of foreign expenditures
or 80% of local expenditures.
3.17      These percentages, whicln correspond to the estimated foreign exchange
content of each category above, would be adjusted if required to assure con-
tinued financing from the available loan funds for the period of implementation.
IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
4.01       The main benefits expected to accrue from implementation of the
proposed project are as follows:
(i)  a significant annual addition to the supply of skilled manpower
(590 engineers, 550 higher technicians and 3,200 technicians)
to help meet urgent manpower needs and allow for the progressive
replacement of expatriate specialists in line with the govern-
ment's policy of rapid growth, modernization and self-reliance;
(ii)  the establishment of the first Moroccan institution for training
technical teachers thereby supporting the expansion of the
technical lycee system and allowing for the moroccanization of
the technical teacher service, currently 60% expatriate;



- 23 -
(iii)  provision for training of teachers for the "introduction to
technology" course in lower secondary schools which aims at
improving the relevance of the secondary curriculum to the
modern environment;
(iv)  improving the regional distribution of training opportunities
and strengthening the links between training institutions and
regional industrial centers.
Risks
4.02      Although the proposed project is large it is relatively homogeneous,
focussing as it does on middle and higher technical education. Furthermore,
project institutions are all under tlhe control of the Ministry of National
Education and Training which has an experienced project implementation unit.
The unit has completed the second education project and is successfully imple-
menting the Ministry's components of the third project. However the unit
needs to be strengthened to cope with the additional workload of the proposed
project (para. 3.09) and the maintenance of an experienced and competent staff
would be essential for the efficient implementation of the project.
4.03      The technical lycees proposed under the project were conceived as
providing practically oriented programs which would fit graduates for direct
employment as middle level technicians.  The government considers that while
this principle is sound enough and justified in terms of manpower requirements,
a proportion of the outputs from technical lycees should be allowed to proceed
to higher technical education in order to satisfy the needs of the more
academically inclined students and to ensure the prestige of the lycees as
suppliers of candidates to higher education.  The Bank has no objection to
this view providing the focus on the supply of technicians for industry and
commerce is maintained and a substantial majority of the output finds direct
employment. The government has indicated that limitations on bursaries and
places in higher institutions would keep the proportion proceeding to higher
education at around 10-15% of the annual graduating class. Pressures for
entry to higher education can be anticipated and there is some risk that
the expectations and inclinations of students, parents and teachers may
diminish the emphasis on job preparation which is the raison d'etre for the
technical lycees. The situation would be closely monitored by means of the
proposed tracer system (para. 2.16).
4.04      The project institutions would rely heavily on expatriate teachers
when they become operational and it is estimated that about 700 expatriates
would be needed. Although this represents a substantial recruitment effort,
it is considered feasible in view of the large-scale and efficient program
which has been implemented over many years between Morocco and France (para.
2.17). Recruitment would be facilitated by the special relationship between
the two countries, which is particularly strong in the field of education.
Nevertheless, such a large program would require sound management to ensure
timely recruitment of suitably qualified expatriates. Prospects for the
successful implementation of this recruitment plan have been improved by the
formulation of a long range staff development program for each institution
(para. 2.19) which identifies the numbers and types of expatriate teaching
staff required each year during the first ten years of operation.
