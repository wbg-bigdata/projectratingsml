                         The operation comes as a response to the request by the Government of Iraq to the World Bank for supporting the implementation of Phase I of the Iraq Banking Reform Strategy--
                         ction Plan (2008-2012). The project, which amounts to US$ 10 million, is provided through the Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) to finance the costs and activities associated with the
                         restructuring of the banking sector in Iraq. Specifically, it would support the restructuring of the two state-owned banks and develop their activities in the financial sector➢? in parallel

                         advisory services to the Iraqi authorities to implement the First Phase of the Banking Reform Strategy-Action Plan (2008-2012) that was done in consultations with CBI, BSA, and the
                         senior management of the two state-owned banks. The institutional, operational and financial restructuring of the state-owned commercial banks--Rasheed Bank and Rafidain Bank
                         has been moving smoothly, as evident in the capacity building of its management and core banking staff, as well as in the setting of non-performing loans (NPLs).

                         Good progress has been made to date towards the objectives laid out by the GOI in its comprehensive five-year Banking Reform Strategy. The PMT has made progress in the
                         implementation of the four components of the Project despite the complex situation on the ground.
