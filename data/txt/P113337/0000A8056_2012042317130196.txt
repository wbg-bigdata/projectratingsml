                         Strategy-? Action Plan (2008-2012). The project (US$ 10 million), is provided through the Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) to finance the costs and activities associated with the restructuring of

                         services to the Iraqi authorities to implement the First Phase of the Banking Reform Strategy-Action Plan (2008?? 2012) that was done in consultations with the Ministry of Finance,
                         the CBI, the Board of supreme Audit (BSA), and the senior management of the two state-owned banks. This has been evident in the developments made in the institutional,
                         operational and financial restructuring of the state-owned commercial banks--Rasheed Bank and Rafidain Bank through the capacity building of these banks at the head quarters and
                         branch level in the different governorates. Moreover, at the CBI, the Supervision Department has been restructured and its capacity has been built, especially in the area of risk
                         management. These developments have been reflected in improvements in numerous monitoring macroprudential indicators, including the rise in reserves-to-non-performing loans
                         (NPLs) from 10% to 20%, the rise in the credit-to-GDP ratio from 4% to 6%, and capital adequacy ratios from zero to 4% during the same period from June 2006 (baseline) to
                         December 2011. In addition, a recent major development is the decisions made by the Banking Restructuring Oversight Committee (ROC) on April 3 and 8, 2012 regarding the
                         settlement of NPLs, and the overall financial restructuring of Rashid Bank and Rafidain, as well as the endorsement of the Organizational Structure of these two state-owned banks,
                         aiming at improving their governance structure, and their overall performance.
