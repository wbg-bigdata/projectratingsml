3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3 1 Original Objective



The Project supported development of a modem telecommunications sector that would evolve increasingly
towards market-driven resource allocation. The Project included priority tasks that were part of an agreed
Medium Term Policy Action Program of Sector Reform for 1994 - 1997, to help develop an environment
for increasing competition and private participation. The Government of China (GoC) expected the
reforms to enable rapid and sustainable sector development to overcome widespread telecommunications
shortages which resulted in high costs throughout the economy and hence impeded effective implementation
of development programs in other manufacturing and social sectors. In the course of helping the GoC in
achieving these objectives, the Project financed investments in modem technology of fiber optical long
distance links connecting eleven provinces and local digital switching in three provinces.
3 2 Revised Objective
The World Bank Board approved an Amendment to the Loan Agreement on November 15, 1996. As a
result of extremely economical procurement, project cost savings totaled US$ 120.3 million in the purchase
of all the equipment included in the original Project Components. And in the view of the need for
accelerating telecommunications development, the GoC requested the Bank to amend the Loan Agreement
of April 25, 1994 and to authorize the use of project cost savings to replicate original project investments in
a number of China's less developed areas.
3 3 Original Components
The Project comprised a Reform Component, and an Investment Component. The Reform Component
supported, inter alia:
1. consultant assistance in developing an appropriate accounting system, as well as a program to train
about 25,000 P&T accountants in enterprise accounting;
2 telecommunications tariff review and preparation of an implementation plan for tariff adjustment; and
3. overseas training of MPT staff to enhance their expertise in legal and regulatory fields
The Investment Compoaent included:
I provision of two segments of the long distance inter-provincial fiber optical network:
2. expansion of 920,000 lines of local telephone switching systems in three provinces: Heilongjiang,
Jiangsu and Liaoning.
3 4 Revised Components
The additional investments under the project included:
1. three inter-provincial fiber optical routes;
2. three intra-provincial fiber optical routes.
3 5 Quality at Entry
This Project was not reviewed by QAG-QER. However, at the time of the appraisal, the Quality at Entry
was considered to have been satisfactory. As mentioned above, the Project was designed in line with the
urgent needs to improve its telecommunications services through an accelerated expansion of its
telecommunications networks. The risk of the Govemment's interference with the implementation was
identified. Adequate technical assistance was subsequently provided to the Government of China on policy
-2 -



recommendation.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4 1 Outcome/achievement oj objective
The project was successful in achieving its overall objective. The sector has undergone major reform with
emergence of a pro-competitive and market-driven environment and this has enabled dramatic improvement
in sector performance. The project contributed to the adoption of international accounting standards in
CTC and implementation of cost-based tariff structure. Although the investment contribution through the
project was marginal compared to the overall large scale investment in the sector, it helped to set a
benchmark for high technical standards and contributed to the implementation of sound competitive
procurement practices in CTC. Project achievements are summarized in the paragraphs below.
4 2 Outputs by components
4.2.1 Physical component. The outputs of the physical component are highly satisfactory as summarized
below.
4.2.1.1 Switching network
In the First Phase of the Project, the Bank Loan financed expansion of digital switching exchanges in three
provinces: Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Jiangsu. The installed capacity in Heilongjiang in 1992 was 671,100
lines and the planned expansion was to reach 2,840,000 by 1997, with around 2,393,000 of these lines
working. For this expansion plan, the Bank Loan funded the procurement of around 160,000 lines of
digital switching equipment. As of December 31, 1999, Heilongjiang PTA had more than 6,000,000 digital
lines installed with 4,641,600 working lines. With a total of 25,345 telecom staff, this gives a ratio of staff
per 1,000 working lines of around 5.5, indicating a very high efficiency. In addition to the services of the
provincial branch of CTC (fixed lines), as of December 2000, Heilongjiang is served by 2,359,600
cellular phones provided by the provincial branch of CMC (originally also part of the MPT operator) and
600,600 cellular phones provided by LIANTONG. The combined subscriber density (fixed + cellular) has
reached 23.5 phones per 100 people, which is remarkable considering that Heilongjiang is a rather "poor"
province in China.
The installed capacity in Liaoning in 1992 was 1,006,700 lines and the planned expansion was to reach
3,590,000 by 1997, with some 2,586,000 of these lines working. For this expansion plan, the Bank Loan
funded the procurement of around 170,000 lines of digital switching equipment. As of 31 December 1999,
Heilongjiang PTA had more than 3,000,000 digital lines installed with 2,300,000 working lines.
The installed capacity in Jiangsu in 1992 was 1,513,900 lines and the planned expansion was to reach
4,705,000 by 1997, with some 3,570,000 of these lines working. For this expansion plan, the Bank Loan
funded the procurement of around 590,000 lines of digital switching equipment. As of December 31, 1999,
Jiangsu PTA had more than 7,000,000 digital lines installed and around 6,000,000 working lines. This
figures along with 18,000 employees gives a ratio of staff per 1,000 working lines of around 3 4, indicating
a very high efficiency. In addition to the services of the provincial branch of CTC (fixed lines),
3-



Heilongjiang is served by more than 3,000,000 cellular phones from the provincial branch of CMC and
from LIANTONG as of December 2000.
4.2.1.2 Transmission network
The Bank's financed contribution to the digitalization of the long distance transmission network mainly
consisted of the construction of a grid of optical fiber cables and the implementation of the SDH
technology. A summary of the overall digitalization of the transmission system was prepared by CTC and
is attached to the Borrower's Contribution in Section 10 "Additional Information"
In the first Phase, the Project financed two out of 27 inter-provincial fiber optical cables planned by MPT.
These two routes were: (a) a 2,084 km fiber optical cable in the North of China, going from Beijing
through Zhengbei in Hebei province, Hohhot, Baotou and Wuhai in Inner Mongolia, Yinchuan and
Wuzhang in Ningxia province, up to Lanzhou in Gansu province; and (b) a 4,661 km fiber optical cable in
the South of China, going from Hangzhou in Zhejiang province and from Fuzhou in Fujian province to
meet in Nanchang in Jiangxi province and continuing West through Changsha in Hunan province, Guiyang
in Guizhou province, up to Chengdu in Sichuan province.
The Second Phase of the Project included three inter-provincial and three intra-provincial fiber optical
cables: (a) a 1,522 km fiber optical cable branching from Hohhot in Inner Mongolia (from one of the cable
routes funded in the First Phase) to Xi'An in Shaanxi province; (b) a 1,422 km fiber optical cable joining
the extremes of the two inter-provincial cable routes funded in the First Phase from Lanzhou in Gansu
province to Chengdu in Sichuan province; (c) a 1,653 km fiber optical cable around Hebei province, from
Shijiazhuang in the South west of Hebei to Qinghuangdao in the North-East of Hebei, although this route is
100% inside Hebei the investment was handled by Central MPT/MII and considered as part of the
Inter-Provincial cable grid, (d) eight routes with 2,791 km of intra-provincial fiber optical cable in
Guangxi Zuang Autonomous Region (out of 14,700 km installed in the Project period), plus upgrading of
the digital microwave link to SDH technology in the route: Nanning - Qinzhou - Beihai; (e) two of the three
intra-provincial SDH digital microwave rings: for the South and the Westem rings, plus 223.8 km of
optical fiber cable for the link from Pingxiang to Ji'An (out of 2,200 km installed in the Project period); and
(f) more than 10 fiber optical cable links in Sichuan province, as part of a provincial plan which included
21 sections for a total of 5,178 km, with total cost of US$ 65.6 million, out of which the Bank contributed
US$ 18.3 million.
4.2.2 Institutional development program (IDP) component
Bank supervised in close coordination with co-financier BITS (later SIDA) from Sweden the two main
consultancies: (a) an accounting consultancy where the Consultant performed an in-depth case study of
Jiangsu PTA and prepared a report on how to move from the existing Chinese Accounting Standards
toward IAS; and (b) a tariffs study which culminated in a "Tariffs Seminar" held in Beijing in October
1998, to discuss the study recommendations, aimed at moving service rates closer to cost-based values. The
seminar recommendations were approved by the State Council and implemented by MU in December 1998.
4.2.3 Sector Restructuring Component.
The outputs of this component were rated as highly satisfactory during the Project implementation period,
and major additional steps were completed toward the time of Project closing The sector went through
major changes during the life of the Project, as shown below:

Customers for Public Telecommunications Services
The sector reform measures initiated under the project were advanced:
I post operation was separated from telecom operation;
2 competition was introduced by the creation of LIANTONG and JITONG, and later by splitting the
main operator into CTC and CMC, in addition to having a major joint-stock company, subsidiary of
CMC, also competing in the market;
3 value-added services, in particular paging, are provided by around thousand privately-owned
companies and by LIANTONG;
4 private participation in the provision of basic services was greatly advanced with the transfer of
additional provincial operations from CMC to its partially private subsidiary, CM-HK;
5. the split on February 14, 1999 of MI's operating entity into a fixed line operator (CTC), a cellular
operator (CMC), and a satellite operator (CHINASAT). (Please see Section 10: "Additional
information" for more detailed background informnation); and
6. CTC (the largest operator) is positioning itself for re-entering competition in the mobile market and for
floating IPOs to introduce private capital participation in its ownership.
4 3 Net Present Value/Econonzic rate oj return
This Project benefited all sectors of the economy through improved access to telecom facilities and
improved service quality. The government services and business community also benefited from improved
access to modem transmission facilities enabling good quality data transfer.
Calculation of the financial (FRR) and economic rates of return (ERR) on individual components and on
the Project as a whole, however, became trivial, as this Project represented only a small percentage of total
MPT and/or provincial PTA's planned investment. In summary, Bank financed some 950,000 switching
- 6 -



lines in the period of 1993 to 2000; during the same period the main fixed line network increased from 22.2
million to over 180 million, making the Bank-financed part a mere 0.6% of the total increase. The fiber
optical cables funded in both the first and second phases arnounted to 16,000 kIn, equivalent to 1.6% of the
total of 1 million km installed in China during that period. The following table illustrates the situation of
the local switching system at the provincial level.
Bank Loan Financed Lines Total Increase 1% of the Investment Plan
Heilongjiang          184.000               5.500.00(         3.3%
Liaoning              170.000               3.000.00(         5.7%
Jiangsu               5900000               6.500.00          9.1%
4 4 Financial rate of return
CTC's and CMC's financial performance during the project period was strong enough to generate
sufficient funds from their operations to cover a high percentage of the total project costs and to meet all
financial covenants. In addition, each of those "less-developed" provinces, such as Jiangxi, Guangxi Zuang,
has been able to generate sufficient sources from depreciation, surcharges and installation fees and to
obtain access to local financing for the remaining part of their investment plans which demonstrates a solid
financial position. The financial performance of Guangxi and Jiangxi Provinces are provided in Annex 3
4 5 Institutional development impact
The institutional development impact of the Project, during the Project period (1992-2000), was
substantial: CTC and CMC, two parts of the original Borrower, have developed the largest
telecommunications network in the World and have reached unprecedented efficiency levels, as
demonstrated by a ratio of around 4 staff per 1,000 working lines for CTC.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5 1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency
None
5 2 Factors generally subject to government control
The Government's commitment to sector reforms was firm throughout the Project implementation. The
first important step was the agreement reached during Project preparation on the "Policy Action Plan for
the Telecom Sector", which had been developed in 1990-1993 during the "Telecommunications Sector
Study" (Report # 9413-CHA, issued on February 14, 1994). These agreements were incorporated in the
SAR as Annex 2.3 "Medium - Term Policy Action Program". Now, after ten years, all recommendations
were taken, and today the Chinese telecommunications market is approaching an open competitive market
envisioned by the Bank at the time of the Project approval. It is estimated that as soon as the process of
accession to the WTO is finalized, the two remaining main steps will also be accomplished- (a) opening
competition to all service providers in all market segments (for instance, it would be possible for CTC to
- 7 -



compete in cellular services); and (b) the main service providers ( CTC and CMC), currently without
private sector participation in ownership, will float IPO and become joint-stock companies. Even before
these steps, the two service providers already with private sector participation, LIANTONG and CM-HK,
will increase the percentage of privately owned shares.
One example of the different sequences being followed in the reform process between the Bank
recommendation and the GoC decision was the case of issuing a new Telecom Law The Bank
recommended to take this step at the very beginning of the process, and MPT prepared some drafts of the
telecom law. However, as of December 2000, the GoC decided to shift priorities, and is seeking the
Bank's advice on preparing new telecom policy recommendations and reform options and in reviewing the
existing law to make it compatible and supportive of the forthcomning E-Conumerce legislation. These new
urgent needs have again delayed the issuance of a Telecom Law, mainly because China had not experienced
any major problems due to the lack of an updated telecom law.
5 3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control
The operating branch of MPT, later on MII, and later CTC - CMC, exhibited a remarkable implementation
record. In more than 50 contracts signed under Phases One and Two of this Project, the Bank never
received a complaint from Bidders, and the imnplementation timing was never delayed. On the contrary, it
-was the Borrower who asked the Bank for speeding up procurement/disbursement processes, because they
wanted to strictly comply with their intemally agreed schedules.

The lower amount shown for Borrower's funding of the Project is only the result of an accounting change
where a smaller part of the total investrnent was charged to the Project Account. It should be noted that, as
explained in Sections 4.2.1.1 "Switching" and 4.2.1.2 "Transmission", the Bank's funding represented a
very small percentage of the total investrnent (US$ 208 million compared with more than US$ 120 billion
in the last ten years).
6. Sustainability
6 1 Rationale for sustainability rating
The sustainability of this Project's. achievements is high. The national optical fiber backbone was
- 8 -



successfully established. Currently, the operators in China are already capable of providing access to
modern, high-capacity network transmission facilities. Sector reforms achieved under the Project have
introduced and will continue to increase private participation in the sector. The new operators are planning
for further expansion and improvement of their network coverage to prepare for foreseeable open
competition in both local and international aspects. The Government is planning to award new UMTS
licenses to increase competition. All this should cortinue the progress already made and contribute to
improving access and quality of telecommunications services in China.
6 2 Transition arrangement to regutlar operations
At the Project closing, CT corporate structure was reorganized to fit a highly commercially oriented pattern
of operation. CT appears to be a well structured company that is capable of using greater financial
flexibility. It expects IPO in the near future.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7 1 Lending
Bank performance at identification, preparation and appraisal of the project was satisfactory During the
24 months of preparation, from the initial identification mission to Board approval, the Bank maintained a
close dialogue with its Chinese counterparts to ensure that the project objectives were directly in line with
the Government's goals for the sector.
The Bank staffs assistance and follow-up during preparation and appraisal were satisfactory. The loan
amount and project execution period was well estimated at the time. Given the final outcome of current
sector restructuring aimed at competitive service provision and privatization, the design of the project may
be considered as appropriate.
There was a clear awareness of the project risks by the preparation team, namely the potential of political
interference in the implementation of the sector restructuring. There was no delay in the investment part of
the program due to the borrower's quick and efficient implementation of Bank's procedures, in particular
the adherence to Bank's procurement guidelines.
7 2 Supervision
The overall supervision of the project was satisfactory, as recognized by the borrower Regular supervision
missions were carried out generally every six months and the documentation in the project file has been
adequate. Project performance indicators and financial indicators, as outlined in the SAR, were monitored
on a regular basis and generally served as realistic measures of the project's performance.
Following Bank-financed tariff reforms studies and support in the implementation of new accounting
practices, CT managed to introduce a more efficient financial management model, which resulted in
significant resources optimization. Starting with cellular service provision, the GoC undertook consistent
steps in licensing several competitive operators in all telecommunications market segments
7 3 Overall Bank performance
Overall Bank performance was satisfactory. Bank staff worked closely with the Government and the
implementing agency to monitor progress on the physical components and to assist in the sector reforms.
-9-



The Bank gave substantial advice to the GoC on cost-based tariffs and tariff-rebalancing approaches,
following international best practices.
Borrower
74 Preparation
The quality of the Borrower's commitment and contributions to project preparation was highly satisfactory.
7 5 Government implementation performance
The GoC, with active support from China Telecom, was mainly responsible for the implementation of the
sector restructuring components. The GoC and CT took steps to ensure a successful implementation of
sector reforms by: (a) issuing licences to independent operators and eliminating the monopoly of CT in all
segments of the market, and (b) creating a new independent and financially viable operating company,
China Telecom. Given the overall progress made on the sector reforms during the entire project period, the
Government's performance was considered highly satisfactory.
7 6 Implementing Agency
In terms of investment and technical assistance components, the project started with the operating branch of
MPT as its first implementing agency. After that it was replaced by MII and recently by CTC - CMC.
All these counterparts exhibited remarkable implementation records In more than 50 contracts signed
during the First and Second project phases, the Bank never received any complaint from bidders, and the
implementation timing was never delayed. The implementing agencies' performance was highly
satisfactory.
7 7 Overall Borrower performance
Overall Borrower performance was highly satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
Sector Review. From the very beginning, extensive and focused efforts were made by the Government and
the Bank staff in an interactive process to reach an agreement on the policy action plan based on a
comprehensive sector study. Up-front understanding of the sector, commitments to sector reforms made by
the Governnent and open dialog among all stakeholders led to the success of achieving all the objectives of
the Project
Sector Reform. China has achieved dramatic improvement in sector performance in the absence of modem
regulatory environment. Now that an early-stage pro-competitive market-driven environment has been
created, the Chinese government has recognized a need for a clear institutional and legal framework as
crucial for the next step of sector reforms and sought Bank assistance.
Borrower's Implementation Capacity. The Borrower strictly followed Bank procurement guidelines and
even pushed for speeding up the procurement/disbursement processes. Along with the project cost savings
and competitive bidding, the Borrower's motivation to comply strictly with its internally agreed schedules
and the capacity of absorbing and using the technical assistance in sector reforms greatly contributed to the
overall success and sustainability of the Project.

Rural Access. CTC and CMC have reached an outstanding expansion of their networks, which has
extended access to telecommunications services to more than 80% of all rural villages, and has improved
the telephone density to more than 20% of the already connected areas. Some of the PTBs had already
secured financing for the investment plan aimed at reaching a 100% coverage. In China, only the fixed line
operator has a Universal Service Obligation. The targets set by the government, however, were successfully
met in the provinces relevant to this project Unlike the universal access funding models known in other
developing countries, this central-planning scheme is worth further researching.

The contribution of Borrower to Implementation Completion Report: China Telecom
In 1988, The World Band started to approach the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of China to
discuss the provision of the World Bank loan in the telecom industry. After numerous meetings between the
World Bank and the corresponding departments of China, the project went on smoothly and the loan
agreement amounting to 250 million US dollars was signed in 1994. By international competitive bidding,
the price of optical cable transmission and switching equipment was lowered As a result, during the
process of implementing the project (the first phase), we discussed with the World Bank about the
establishment of the following-up project (the second phase) funded by the savings of the World Bank loan
Soon the second project went into operation.
As is known to the World Bank, great changes took place in China during the process of implementing the
World Bank loan. The first was the separation of the regulatory and operational functions On the basis of
the former Ministry of Posts and Telecommunication, the Ministry of Information Industry was established
At the same time, the operation of post and telecom was also separated, leading to the establishment of the
State Postal Bureau and the Directorate-general of Telecormmunications. In the wake of the above events,
the Directorate-general of Telecommunications separated the fixed, mobile, paging and satellite services
and formed China Telecom Corp., China Mobile Corp., Guoxin Paging Corp. and China Satellite Corp.
respectively. As a result, the market competition was created in the telecom industry of China, with China
Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom as the major players.
While providing the project loan, the World Bank also provided technical assistance projects to the
beneficiary organizations in the loan project, covering the tariff study and the consultant and training on
accounting. Through these studies, the financial management and accounting work level of these
organizations was greatly improved.
We thank the World Bank for the assistance it has provided for the system reform and development of the
telecom industry in China. The assistance has facilitated the progress of China Telecom toward the modern
enterprise.
New technologies adopted by China Telecom in the transmission network
I Wave division multiplexing technology is widely used. The wave division multiplexing of 16-32 waves
is widely adopted for the backbone networks to give a full play of the optical fiber bandwidth.
2. The transmission rate is further improved. 10Gb/s system is widely constructed. In connection with the
- 1 1 -



wave division multiplexing technology, the transmission rate of single optical fiber is 320Gb/s. 400G
and 1600G system is also used over the network to support the big capacity communications.
3. For the newly laid optical cables, G.655 of new type of optical fibers is adopted to improve the
transmission capacity.
4. Integrated operation of loop and mesh networks (8 vertical and 8 horizontal) to make the good use of
the advantages of each type so as to improve the reliability and capacity of the networks.
5. The construction of DXC network all over the country improved the flexibility of the network and the
efficiency of the service provision.
6. Advanced network management technology is adopted and various network management systems are
developed to improve the overall management capability of the transmission networks and to have the
real-time understanding of the network situation at any time.

10. Additional Information
Background of Sector Reforms
Until 1990, the MPT was a monopoly service provider and at the same time, the sector regulator. On
September 13, 1993, the State Council authorized the creation of "China United Telecommunications
Corporation" (or LIANTONG, or CHINA-UNICOM), jointly owned by the Ministry of Railways (MoR),
the Ministry of Power (MoP), and the Ministry of Electronic Industry (MEI). This action introduced, for
the first time in China, competition in the provision of basic voice telephone services, and started a reform
path.
As a reaction to the newly introduced competition, MPT obtained in March 1994 from the State Council
the authorization to re-organize itself by creating a "Directorate General for Posts" (DGP) and a
"Directorate General for Telecommunications" (DGT). The original intention was to use DGP and DGT as
the seed for new commercially oriented operators, and DGT was expected to evolve into a "Holding
Company" for the provincial telecommunications operators. However, this was never fulfilled. Successive
re-organizations have carried the sector to a different structure. In April 1995, DGT changed its name to
"CHINA TELECOM", which was a commercial reaction to Liantong.
A more substantial step by MPT followed in the commercial competition with LIANTONG In June 1997,
MPT created a subsidiary cellular operating entity based in Hong Kong, "CHINA TELECOM - HONG
KONG" (CT-HK). The cellular operations of three key provincial PTAs: Jiangsu - Zhejiang and
Guangdong CT-HK were transferred to CT-HK which went public at the Hong Kong stock exchange.
MPT/GoC obtained US$ 4.2 billion for 23.5 % of the shares.
On April 1, 1998, the GoC restructured itself by reducing from 40 to 29 Ministries. As a result, MPT was
replaced by a new Ministry of Information Industry (MII), which merged MPT (the main owner of China
Telecom) with MEI (one of the key owners of the competitor LIANTONG), the broadcasting functions, but
not the staff, from the National Radio Regulatory Commission, and the responsibilities from the
"Informatization Commission" Among other things, this created for the first time in China a centralized
regulatory entity by giving MII the main regulatory and sector policy functions, including issuing of
- 12 -



licenses, tariffs setting and monitoring, frequency management and supervision of interconnection
agreements in a multi-operator environment.
In 1998, LIANTONG was protected by the measures undertaken by the State Council and maintained
competition in the telecom sector: (a) some key staff from the old-MPT were transferred to LIANTONG,
(b) most of LIANTONG's debt was absorbed by the GoC; and (c) all paging operations from the PTAs
(which had been centralized in the new entity: "GUO XIN") were transferred to LIANTONG
1998 was also the year when the full separation of Postal and Telecommunications activities was
implemented. This process was initiated in June 1998 with pilot cases in the new "provincial area" of
Chongqing and Hainan. Another major step in restructuring the telecom sector was accomplished in 1999
with the separation of CHINA - TELECOM into four independent entities (a) CHINA TELECOM
CORPORATION - CTC, as the fixed line operator (in essence it was returning to the original wire-line
operator in place at the beginning of this Project); (b) CHINA MOBILE CORPORATION - CMC, as the
cellular operator which took the mobile operations of the 28 PTAs still under MPT/MIl; (c) all Paging
operations, already centralized as  "Guo Xin" were transferred to LIANTONG; and (d) all satellite
operations, formerly under "China Telecommunications Broadcasting Satellite Corporation (CTBSC)"
were given to a new operator: "CHINASAT"
Following tariff adjustments which took place in 1994 (for cellular services), 1995 and December 1996, the
State Council approved on March 1, 1999, a major change in tariffs. This was the result of one of the
Technical Assistance components under this Project, funded by BITS/SIDA from Sweden, whose
reconumendations were discussed on the Final Consultancy Seminar held in Beijing in October 1998. The
State Council adopted all the recommendations included in the Tariffs Study, except for the tariffmg of
cellular services, where the Study recommended "European style tariffs", i.e. with calling party paying and
no payment for receiving calls; instead, the State Council adopted the "American style", where the cellular
subscriber also pays for receiving calls. This decision was reversed to "calling party pays" a year later.
CT-HK later changed its name to "CHINA MOBILE - HONG KONG" (CM-HK) to reflect that now it is
a subsidiary of CMC. (Additionally, it has been the policy of the GoC/MII and CMC that most of the
assets of the formerly government-owned operator CMC be transferred to CM-HK, which is now in part
privately owned). During the year 2000, first the mobile operation of three more PTAs was transferred to
CM-HK: Fujian, Henan and Hainan; and on October 4, 2000, seven more followed: Hebei, Shandong,
Liaoning, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangxi Zuang. This transaction was for an amount of US$
32.84 billion, and made CM-HK the largest cellular operator in China with 55 9 % of the market (the
second largest in the world). This deal also included selling shares to VODAPHONE, UK. for US$ 2 5
billion, thus increasing the private participation in CM-HK.
During 2000, LLANTONG completed its long delayed IPO, which had to wait for a final settlement in the
CCF cases. Finally, CTC positioned itself for an IPO by increasing its efficiency through successive
re-organizations. It is clear that private sector participation and competition are now becoming an integral
part in the Chinese telecom sector.
