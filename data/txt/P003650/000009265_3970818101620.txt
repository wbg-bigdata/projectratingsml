1. INTRODUCTION
A. OVERVIEW OF THE ENERGY SECTOR
Supply and Demand
1.1   China has become the third largest producer of energy in the world. The
country's primary commercial energy supply and consumption increased at around 4.1
percent per year from 1980 to 1995 to reach 1,239.0 tons of standard coal equivalent
(tce). Coal is the most important source of energy, accounting for about 74.8 percent, and
oil for 17.2 percent of the total production. Hydroelectric power (6.1 percent), natural gas
(1.9 percent), and small quantities of shale oil and geothermal power make up the
balance. During the same period, the primary energy consumption increased at about 5.1
percent to reach 1,290.0 tce. The largest consumer of energy is the industrial sector (75.4
percent), followed by households (9.7 percent), services (8.6 percent), and agriculture
(6.3 percent). Details of the primary energy outputs are given in Annex 1.1, and total
energy production and consumption in Annex 1.2.
Energy Resources
1.2   Coal. China has large coal deposits, with recoverable reserves of about 900
billion tons, of which 30 percent are proven. In 1995, the country produced more than
1.2 billion tons of raw coal. By the year 2000, China aims to produce 1.4 to 1.6 billion
tons of coal a year. The best quality coals are found in North China, where Shanxi and
Inner Mongolia each has reserves of about 200 billion tons. However, insufficient
transport capacity makes it extremely difficult to move sufficient coal to the large
consumption centers in Central and East China.
1.3   Hydroelectric Potential. China is rich in water resources and has a long tradition
of harnessing them for energy and other uses. The country's hydroelectric potential is
estimated at 1,900 TWh a year, but only about 9 percent of it has been developed. Most
of the potential is located in the southwest (70 percent), about 1,500 km away from the
main demand centers. However, the long gestation period for hydroelectric projects and
the lack of capital have slowed the development and utilization of hydroelectric
resources.
1.4   Crude Oil. China's ultimately recoverable reserves of crude oil are estimated at
some 80 billion tons, of which approximately 20 percent are proven. The 1995
production amounted to about 150 million tons of crude oil and cumulative production
reached about 2.45 billion tons. China's refining capacity is the sixth largest in the
world. However, with the sharply increasing consumption, the country will become net
importer in the near future.



-2 -
1.5   Natural Gas. China's natural gas resources are estimated at 33 trillion m3, of
which 3 to 5 percent are proven. In 1995, China produced 17.7 billion m3 of natural gas.
About 58 percent of the current production is nonassociated gas, mostly from Sichuan
Province. The remaining gas production is associated with onshore crude oil production.
1.6   Biomass. Noncommercial biomass energy use currently amounts to about one
quarter of total energy consumption in China. Fuelwood and agricultural residues are the
chief biomass fuels, and they are consumed almost entirely by rural households. China is
promoting a variety of measures to achieve environmentally sustainable biomass supply
and consumption levels, including more efficient use of biomass, tree planting, and
substitution of other fuels for traditional biomass fuels.
1.7   Nuclear Energy. Known uranium reserves in China are sufficient to sustain
15,000 MW of nuclear power capacity for 30 years. China commissioned its first
commercial nuclear power plant (300 MW) in 1992, in Zhejiang Province. In 1993/94,
the Daya Bay nuclear power plant (2x900 MW) was also commissioned; 70 percent of its
output is intended for nearby Hong Kong. The construction of a few additional plants is
planned to start before the year 2000, primarily in regions which lack coal and
hydroelectric resources.
1.8   Other Energy Resources. Other energy resources play a small role in energy
supply and are used mostly in remote areas. Geothermal energy has been found in
locations throughout the country. Although wind and solar energy have promising
prospects, they are not expected to significantly affect the overall supply of energy in the
near future. Oil shale deposits are large, but little is exploited because of lack of viable
technology.
B. THE POWER SECTOR
Supply and Demand
1.9   China is the second largest producer of electricity in the world. By the end of
1995, China's total installed capacity reached about 217.2 GW, 75 percent of which is
thermal capacity and the rest hydropower (24 percent) and nuclear power (1 percent)
(Annex 1.3). China has five regional and eight separate provincial power networks, of
which seven have installed capacities of 10 GW or more. The five regional power grids
(East China, North China, Northeast China, Central China and Northwest China)
coordinate the systems of several provinces and municipalities together. The total length
of the high and medium-voltage transmission lines (i.e., from 500 kV down to 110 kV)
lines amounted to 267,500 km and the transformer capacity of substations down to the
110 kV at the secondary level (owned and operated by the power utilities) was about
234 GVA. Considering the power supply as a whole from production to end-user supply,
transmission and distribution losses are estimated at about 16 percent of generation.
1.10  Total power generation in China increased by more than two and one-half times
between 1980 and 1995, an average increase of 8.0 percent per year over 14 years. About



- 3 -
1,007 TWh were generated in 1995, with thermal power accounting for 80 percent. The
share of hydroelectric power has remained fairly stable over the last decade. Even though
the Government has maintained a strong commitment to hydropower development,
capital constraints and the distance of major resources from load centers inhibit more
rapid development. Coal-fired power plants provide more than 90 percent of thermal
generation, with oil-fired generation accounting for most of the balance. The share of oil-
fired generation has declined sharply since the early 1980s, owing to a concerted
government policy to minimize petroleum use for power. The share of natural-gas based
generation is negligible and is expected to remain so unless major natural gas discoveries
are made.
1.11  Industry continues to dominate electricity consumption in China, accounting for
74.9 percent of electricity use in 1995; agriculture accounted for 6.2 percent, residential
consumers for 10.2 percent, municipal and commercial consumers for 6.9 percent, and
transport and communications for 1.8 (Annex 1.4). Industrial demand has continued to
drive overall power demand; more than 71.5 percent of incremental electricity use
between 1985 and 1995 was in the industrial sector. Although service is of uneven
quality, rural access to electricity is high; about 96 percent of the nation's villages and
about 80 percent of rural families now have access to electricity.
1.12  Despite the strong growth in electricity output, most areas of China continue to
suffer from severe power shortages. Since GDP grew by 9.3 percent per year during
1980-95, the elasticity of electricity consumption growth relative to GDP growth was
only 0.86-an exceptionally low elasticity for any country over a sustained period, and
particularly for an industrializing country such as China. Chinese officials estimate the
shortfall between peak power demand and supply at more than 10 percent. Daily load
curves are relatively flat, as industries have had to respond to power shortages during the
peak daytime periods through rescheduling of work shifts. It is expected that power
shortages will be more acute in the two to three coming years because of accumulated
delays in power projects due to financial constraints.
1.13  China's GDP is expected to grow by at least 8 to 9 percent per year during the
ninth five-year plan (1996-2000). This rapid economic growth will put tremendous
pressure on China's electric power industry to avoid yet worse shortages. China's
electric power construction program for the 1990s will certainly be the world's largest.
Assuming that an aggressive conservation effort can enable an electricity demand/GDP
growth elasticity of 1.0 to be sustained, electricity demand could be expected to continue
to grow at average rates of 8 to 9 percent per year during 1996-2000. To keep pace with
this demand growth, China would need to add some 17-20 GW of capacity per year. The
total investment in China in 1995 was Y 1,945 billion, of which Y 101 billion (5.2
percent) was in the power sector.
1.14  Although China's current power development program emphasizes addition of
300 to 600 MW units, over one half of China's thermal power capacity is still in units
below 200 MW. Only about 12 percent of the total installed capacity is in units of



- 4 -
300 MW or more, compared to 60 to 80 percent in industrialized countries. The average
gross conversion efficiency of thermal units over 6 MW has improved over the 1980s,
reaching about 33 percent in 1995. This efficiency level is not unreasonable given the
low average unit sizes in operation, but is substantially lower than the 36 to 37 percent
typical of reasonably efficient systems with larger units.
Power Sector Institutions
1.15 In the period 1988-92, the Ministry of Energy (MOE) maintained primary
responsibility within the Central Government for policy, planning and regulation of the
power and related energy subsectors. In May 1993, MOE was restructured during a
broad government reorganization, and a Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP) was
established, along with a Ministry of Coal and the existing China National Petroleum
Corporation. Chart 1 shows the entities that are within MOEP oversight. The State
Planning Commission (SPC), on behalf of the State Council, has the responsibility for
review and approval of the strategic plans, investment programs and general pricing
policy of the energy sector. The Ministry of Water Resources still supervises rural
electrification and development of decentralized power systems in approximately 800
counties relying mostly on small hydropower.
1.16  Until early 1993, the State Energy Investment Corporation (SEIC) channeled
Government funds to finance coal and power projects. SEIC was responsible for
onlending funds for projects of national importance and representing the central
Government in jointly financed projects. However, in April 1994, SEIC (and five other
specialized investment companies under SPC) were merged into a new policy bank, the
State Development Bank (SDB). The Construction Bank of China usually performs
policy lending as a disbursement/collection agency for SDB, and commercial banking
activities on its own account. For provincial power companies, equity and loans/debt
representing central government's contribution are channeled through the regional
groups. In some cases, such as Ertan Hydropower Electric Company Ltd., equity stakes
are held by the State Development Investment Corporation (SDIC).
C. POWER SECTOR REFORMS-PROGRESS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
1.17  Reforms in China's power sector during the 1980s involved a series of
incremental adjustments, largely to mobilize additional investment capital to finance
rapid growth. Taken as a whole, these adjustments have resulted in a sector structure that
is largely unrecognizable from that in the early 1980s. In 1980, the power sector was
fully controlled, managed and funded by Central Government departments. By the early
1990s, the sector had become much more decentralized, less vertically integrated and
open to nonutility producers.
1.18  In conformance with broad national reforms toward a market economy begun in
mid-1992, the Government initiated, in the early 1990s, a program of power sector
reforms. The reform agenda includes: (a) overhaul of the regulatory and legal
framework for the sector; (b) further diversification in financing for power development,



-5-
including private sector participation; (c) institutional restructuring-commercialization
and corporatization of power companies, and associated sector restructuring; and (d) the
rationalization of power tariffs.  The Chinese approach to reform  encourages
experimentation with different reform options and institutional forms. This gradual
approach permits the Chinese to examine the relevance and applicability of specific
reforms, and also to fine-tune implementation for their broader dissemination or
replication in other parts of the country.
1.19 Legal and Regulatory Reform. China recently undertook two important steps in
its legal and regulatory reform agenda. First, the Standing Committee of the 17th session
of the National People's Congress passed the first "Electricity Law of the People's
Republic of China," which became effective on April 1, 1996 (Box 1.1). Second, the
State Council (a) approved the creation of the National Power Grid Company, which will
operate the future national (interregional) transmission network; and (b) proposed for
consideration by the National People's Congress a restructuring plan that provides for
abolition of MOEP and transfer of regulatory and policy functions to the State Economic
and Trade Commission (SETC), the State Planning Commission (SPC) and the China
Electricity Council. A State Power Company has been created and entrusted with the
ownership functions of the central government and development of interregional
transmission systems.
1.20 An important and innovative experiment in regulatory reform is being conducted
in Hainan Province to make the transition to an unbundled sector structure with separate
regulation.  Actions undertaken include:  creation of a single transmission and
distribution shareholding company; several generating companies, including a wholly
foreign-owned one; and establishment on June 1, 1995 of a separate agency to regulate
the sector. Lessons learned from this experiment will be taken into account in furthering
the power sector reform efforts in other provinces. A more ambitious experiment is
under consideration for Fujian Province.
1.21  Diversification of Financing. Following changes in power project financing
from Government grants to loans in the early 1980s, the Government encouraged the
development of additional financing sources from provincial and local governments,
large consumers, and, in some cases, private foreign partners. Since the mid-1980s, the
Government has allowed power produced from power plants financed through these
nontraditional sources to be sold at prices which provide for full debt servicing and
reasonable profit. This is referred to as the "new plant, new price policy." Empowered
with rights to impose surcharges to accumulate funds for investment in power
construction, provincial and local governments have become a key source of financing,
providing more than half of the investment funding for the sector in 1995. As a
consequence, the share of Central Government financing in power sector investment has
fallen sharply, from 91 percent (mostly through State Budget allocations) in 1980 to less
than 35 percent in 1995.

Box 1.1: THE ELECTRIC POWER LAW FOR THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
On December 28, 1995, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress enacted a
comprehensive new law that applies to every part of the power sector. The Electric Power Law became
effective April 1996, and is intended to support reforms necessary to introduce the socialist market
economy to the power sector.
The Electric Power Law generally specifies broad principles that must be implemented through the
issuance of additional State Council regulations and other legal instruments. The Electric Power Law
provides a solid foundation upon which to establish an adequate regulatory system. However, consistent
with the direction of reforms for the Chinese economy, the Electric Power Law has the following specific
objectives:
.  To encourage the development of the power industry consistent with development of a socialist
market economy.
* To encourage the development of poor and rural areas.
* To encourage private investment in power generation, but not in other power sector activities,
such as transmission and distribution.
. To protect the legal interests of power enterprises, investors, and power customers.
* To encourage the development of renewable resources and new technology.
* To protect the safety of power facilities and installations.
The Electric Power Law covers the construction of power facilities and the supply of power in China and
applies to both Chinese and foreign companies. The Law includes 10 chapters and covers, among other
things, electric power construction, electric power and electric network management, supply and utilization
of power, power tariffs, rural electric power construction and agricultural use of power, and the protection
of electric facilities.
The Electric Power Law includes several provisions directly relevant to the design and creation of the legal
framework for the power sector, including the following:
* Article 6 sets forth the government institutions responsible for regulation of the power sector.
* Article 7 guarantees power enterprises' rights to operate autonomously subject to government
supervision.
* Articles 10 through 12 set forth requirements governing power sector planning.
* Articles 18 through 23 set forth requirements for power production and electric network system
service.
* Article 25 requires issuance of power supply licenses to serve customers within exclusive
geographic service territories.
* Articles 26 through 34 set forth the service requirements that must be satisfied by power supply
enterprises and the specific rights and obligations of customers.
* Articles 25 through 35 set forth principles that govern tariff determinations and that allocate tariff
responsibilities among different levels within the government.
* Articles 56 through 58 authorize inspections for the purposes of enforcement of legal and
regulatory requirements.
* Articles 59 through 74 set forth penalties for violations of various provisions of the Electric
Power Law.
1.22 Newly formed corporations have also become important players. The Huaneng
International Power Development Corporation (HIPDC) was formed in 1985 with the aim



of attracting foreign capital and technology for power plants located mainly in coastal
areas. As an independent power producer, HIPDC operates its 11 plants (6,700 MW
total) under a build, own and operate (BOO) framework. HIPDC had a mandate to raise
funds from the international financial market. It has been able to tap bilateral and export
credits, and commercial bank loans, and to raise foreign equity capital through an
American Depository Receipt (ADR) issue in New York in 1994. The Sunburst Energy
Development Corporation (SEDC), with three large power projects under
implementation, and the recently established China Power Investment Corporation
(CPIC) are other windows for the Government's investment, and cofinancing with the
local governments and foreign sources in power projects. Several joint ventures have
been established to build several power plants with capacity ranging from 40 MW to
700 MW. Two major joint venture projects have been recently approved in Shandong
Province (Rizhao power plant-2x350 MW coal-fired units) and in Shanghai (Zhadian
power plant-4x 100 MW gas turbines).
1.23  Build, own and transfer (BOT) schemes have also been introduced in China, most
notably the privately-financed Shajiao B and Shajiao C thermal power plants in
Guangdong Province, respectively commissioned in 1986 and 1996. Another major BOT
project sponsored by two international consortia have been approved by SPC in 1993 in
Fujian Province (Meizhou Wan power plant-2x350 MW coal-fired units). The process
of international competitive tendering for projects has also begun. SPC approved the Lai
Bin B project in the Guangxi Autonomous Region to be the first power project to pilot
the international competitive bidding framework. SPC invited 12 of the 31 companies/
consortia that sought prequalification to bid competitively for the Lai Bin B project. Six
international consortia participated in the competition. Bids were opened in May 1996
and an 18-year concession was awarded to the winning consortium on November 11,
1996. Bids will shortly be issued for Changsha project in Hunan Province.
D. POWER PRICING
1.24  Electricity price reform in China has involved a series of incremental changes
over the last 10 years. In the mid-1980s, multiple-track pricing was introduced for both
producers and consumers, in line with the shift away from full vertical integration in the
industry. This strategy was successful in increasing overall tariff levels but, by the end of
the decade, the power pricing system had become too complex and difficult to manage.
Recent reforms have therefore focused on simplification and rationalization of the
system.
1.25  At the producer level, the state catalog prices charged for power produced by
Central Government-financed plants were modified in 1993. Prices for the electricity
produced from all new power plants are now set by contract to cover financing and
operating costs (guidance prices), on a plant-by-plant basis, and rolled into the average
power tariff. Cost recovery through the tariff system for new investments is thus ensured.
Prices also are similarly determined for existing plants financed through loans. The
electricity tariff applied for plants built with grant financing before 1985 has been



- 8 -
rationalized to now include an improved mechanism to automatically adjust prices
annually to reflect fuel and transportation cost variations. Following the enactment of the
Electricity Law, the dialogue between the Chinese government and the Bank focused on
implementation of the new pricing principles to ensure that producer prices reflect the
level and structure of the cost supply (introduction of a capacity and energy payment
formula) and are conducive to economic dispatch and optimum production efficiency.
1.26  At the consumer level, the prices are in general an average of the state catalog
prices and the guidance prices (that reflect full costs of supply from sources not financed
through the Central Government) plus national and local fees and surcharges. While the
situation varies between regions, the nature of the existing pricing system is such that
average consumer prices (including fees and surcharges) approximate long-run marginal
cost levels in areas with rapid load growth, such as the coastal provinces. However, the
average prices in some of these provinces increased at a slower pace than the long-run
marginal cost due to limitation of price increases to control inflation in 1995 and 1996.
The average consumer price in these areas still covers more than 85 percent of the long-
run marginal cost. Prices in underdeveloped areas, such as Sichuan and Henan, are still
below long-run marginal cost levels, but are being gradually rationalized with increasing
supply from new plants.
1.27  While consumer tariffs, are approaching satisfactory levels, their structure remains
too complex, lacks transparency, and is inequitable. In most areas, including some North
China systems, unfair "old" administered rates (based on catalog prices) and "new" rates
(including higher prices for new power) continue to be applied to different consumers
through a complex quota system.  Some consumers are protected from  high-cost
electricity supply charges and certain local surcharges because they still hold "in-plan"
quota allocations, but other new or small consumers must pay high prices well above
actual supply costs. Following the enactment of the Electricity Law, further and speedier
progress is expected on abolishing the two-track pricing system (unification of tariffs has
been reaffirmed by article 37 of the Electricity Law) and improving the tariff structure to
reflect the costs of supply of final consumers.
E. ELECTRICITY CONSERVATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Electricity Conservation
1.28  China has over 10 years of experience in the active promotion of electricity
conservation, with a solid record of achievement. The strength of its program lies in the
well-developed institutional framework. Electricity conservation is handled by the
network of "Three Electricity Offices," with offices at central, provincial, prefectural and
county levels throughout the country. These offices are under the leadership of local
Economic Commissions, and coordinate their work with provincial power companies.
They monitor electricity intensity and use patterns in all major enterprises, promote
adoption of conservation technologies and electricity management improvements, and
assist in organizing funding for efficiency programs supported by the Government.



1.29  These measures have been successful, as is indicated by the low ratio of elasticity
of growth in electricity demand to GDP growth of 0.86 achieved during 1980-95.
However, energy electricity conservation programs have always been based on centrally
designed energy/electricity conservation policies and heavily-subsidized administrative
programs. Faced with constrained fiscal revenues, the government is now promoting a
shift in the energy conservation programs to rely more on market-based incentives and
introduce innovative and commercially-based contractual and financing mechanisms.
Environmental Protection
1.30 Thermal power production currently accounts for about one third of China's coal
consumption, and this share is expected to increase gradually. Improvements in the
efficiency of coal use in this sector not only alleviate pressure on the coal production and
transportation system, but also have a major impact on particulate, sulfur and carbon
dioxide emissions.
1.31  The achievement of economies of scale in thermal power production, through
expanded development of large generating units, is a priority because of the recent rapid
growth of small coal-fired power plants, in unit sizes of 50 MW or less. While national
policy emphasizes the addition of 300 MW and 600 MW units, new projects have lagged
behind demand and local governments are continuing to invest in large numbers of new
small plants, largely due to difficulties in mobilizing the necessary investment resources.
Compared with a state-of-the-art plant, these plants consume over 60 percent more coal
per unit of electricity produced. This results in at least 60 percent higher sulfur dioxide
(SO2) emissions (depending upon the coal used), and roughly 60 percent greater
emissions of carbon dioxide.  Particulate emissions from  the small plants are
proportionally even higher, due to use of inefficient particulate control technology. If a
sufficient number of large-scale projects cannot be brought on stream in a timely fashion
to substitute smaller inefficient units, there is little doubt that this problem will worsen.
1.32 In terms of emission control in large- and medium-scale plants, China has made
substantial progress in particulate control, through deployment of high-efficiency
electrostatic precipitators. As the country has large reserves of low-sulfur coal, China is
just beginning to employ SO2 control devices in areas where ambient air quality standards
require them. Top priority should be given to areas that must rely on local high-sulfur
coal, such as in southwest China. In these regions, thermal power plants often bum coal
of over 4 percent sulfur content (e.g., 5 to 10 times the level typical through most of north
and east China), and development of SO2 control strategies and corresponding
investments are now urgent in these areas. Several pilot flue gas desulfurization (FGD)
projects have been implemented in areas where the sulfur content of coal is relatively
high: Luohang in Sichuan Province, Japanese-assisted projects in Shandong Province
and Taiyuan in Shanxi Province.
1.33  Recently, the Chinese Government initiated serious efforts to curb air pollution
related to the burning of coal and particularly to reduce the power sector's contribution to



- 10-
the problem. The Government also announced its intention to keep particulate emissions
at about 3.8 million tons (1992 level). It also announced in June 1994 that it will spend
about $2 billion over the next seven years on an environmental program aimed at keeping
SO2 emissions at a level of 15 million metric tons a year, as part of a comprehensive
program of acid rain abatement. An SO2 emission tax (from Y 0.15 to 0.2/kg of SO2) is
being experimented with in several provinces and municipalities and a tax (Y 0.04/kg of
SO2) is applied to emissions exceeding the 1982 standards in all provinces. Several
municipalities, such as Shanghai, issued very stringent environmental regulations and
increased efforts to enforce existing regulations by imposing fines on industrial units and
power plants that do not comply with emission standards and/or imposing use of flue gas
desulfiurization for all new plants.  However, achievement of the Government's
environmental objectives still requires a more adequate enforcement of the national
regulations.
F. ROLE OF THE WORLD BANK
World Bank Power Sector Assistance Strategy
1.34 In line with Bankwide policies, the Bank's energy assistance program in China
places special emphasis on sector reform and energy conservation. During the last two
years, the Bank's technical assistance program for the power sector has focused on
helping the Chinese in assessing reform options (through a study funded by the Bank's
Institutional Development Fund), defining implementation strategies (through sector
work on power sector reform), and exploring options for mobilizing domestic and foreign
private funds to meet the capital needs of sector development (through informal sector
work). The study (Strategic Options in Power Sector Reform in China, 1993) and sector
report (China Power Sector Reform: Toward Competition and Improved Performance,
Report 12929-CHA, 1994) provide vehicles for dialogue between the Bank and Chinese
institutions. Technical assistance is also now being provided to help the central
authorities develop an improved legal and regulatory framework for the sector. The
energy conservation support program includes technical assistance through the Global
Environment Facility (GEF), lending support to selected industrial, environrent and
energy projects, and development of a series of new Bank/GEF investment operations.
The power sector lending program now focuses on assistance for: (a) the detailed aspects
of implementation of the power sector reforms, (b) balanced development of generation
and transmission to reduce the power shortages and transmission bottlenecks that
continue to hamper development and slow the market orientation of the sector,
(c) increased efficiency at the supply and end-use levels, and (d) enhanced environmental
protection.
Bank Involvement
1.35  The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
for China presented to the Board on March 18, 1997. It supports the joint agenda of the
Chinese Government and the World Bank to improve the efficiency and minimize the



- 11 -
environmental impacts of electricity delivery and use while concurrently alleviating
existing power shortages and satisfying the surging demand. These objectives will be
achieved through (a) installation of larger generating units to take advantage of higher
fuel efficiency and economies of scale; (b) mine-mouth location of generating plants to
reduce the cost of coal delivered to the plant, and reduce overloading on the railway
system; (c) minimize action of pollution loads in densely populated areas with low local
absorptive capacity; and (d) introduction of market-based policies and competition
(where possible) and opening the sector further to domestic and foreign private investors.
1.36  Under the proposed project, the establishment of a limited liability company as an
independent power producer will significantly support commercialization of the sector,
and will pave the way for other independent power producers, including those owned by
private investors.  Following the successful approach of the Ertan Hydropower
Development Company, the Tuoketuo Electric Power Generation Company (TEPGC)
will be the first nonutility thermal power generator in China directly supported by the
Bank. The divestiture of generation assets, for which technical assistance is included in
the project, and the use of funds raised on international financial markets to finance
equity in TEPGC would be a significant step toward eliminating barriers to entry,
opening the power sector to private investors and introducing competition at the
generation level. The power purchase agreement can serve as a model for other IPPs and
also help develop North China Power Group Company's (NCPGC) role as a purchasing
agent and thereby stimulate unbundling of and power trade within the North China
system. Furthermore, improved energy efficiency at the generation, transmission and
distribution levels will reduce the adverse environmental impacts of electricity generation
and usage.
G. LESSONS LEARNED
1.37  Since the first project for the power sector in 1982, the Bank has helped to finance
18 large power generation and load management projects, eight thermal, eight hydro, and
two transmission projects (Annex 1.5). Technical assistance in project management,
system operations, finance, management and institutional reform has been included in the
projects. Through these operations, the Bank has helped to introduce: (a) state-of-art
technologies and control systems in generation, transmission, distribution and pollution
control; (b) modern operational practices and procedures to improve power system
reliability and control; (c) improved methods for project planning, design, construction
management, and environmental impact assessment; (d) improved financial planning and
utility management tools and practices; (e) techniques for computing and establishing
appropriate tariff structures and levels; and (f) assistance in sector and regulatory reform.
1.38  The past operations in China, especially the eight thermal power projects, yielded
useful lessons on project preparation, technical and operating aspects of power systems
and sequencing of institutional reform. The experience gained from these projects and
broader international experience in power sector restructuring have also been taken into



- 12 -
account in developing a power sector strategy to be pursued by the Bank in China, and in
designing focused and implementable institutional changes.
1.39  Lessons learned from the previous thermal power projects were considered during
preparation of the proposed project in order to: (a) improve the project management and
ensure proper coordination between the different contractors; (b) improve the quality of
the environmental studies, environmental management plans and monitoring measures;
and (c) ensure commitment of the beneficiary(ies) to the institutional and corporate
reforms to be included in the project. Actions have been taken to involve international
consultants in assisting the beneficiary(ies) to: (a) assess the environmental impacts of
the project and designing the proper measures to address them, (b) incorporate the new
generating company, and (c) prepare a power purchase agreement in line with
international practice. Finally, a serious boiler accident at the Beilungang power station
in Zhejiang province will be taken into account in boiler design and specifications, coal
and "check coal" specifications, and adequate measures of coal quality monitoring.
1.40  In power sector restructuring and reform implementation, international experience
shows that even in advanced countries with strong and transparent institutional systems
and well-established market economies, the time needed to build consensus on the reform
directions, establish a new regulatory framework, and implement structural changes can
be very long. China faces the same problems witnessed in Central and Eastern Europe.
Hopes for achieving quick progress in economic regulation and restructuring of the power
sectors in these countries have been unfulfilled because of the intricate links of
institutional changes to politics, complex macroeconomic reforms to ensure the transition
toward market economy without disruption, and the difficult implementation of adequate
and credible legal and regulatory frameworks. Therefore, the proposed project focuses on
limited implementable priority actions to improve the commercial orientation of the
beneficiaries, improve the contractual arrangements, increase competition and improve
operational efficiency of the sector.

2. THE POWER MARKET
A. AN OVERVIEW
2.1   The Tuoketuo Thermal Power Project is located in Inner Mongolia, and is being
developed to meet growing electricity demand in the north China power system, which
covers three provinces (Hebei, Shanxi, West Inner Mongolia) and two municipalities
(Beijing, Tianjin). Most of the project output will be exported to the Beijing area where
electricity demand has been suppressed but still increased at about 8 percent per year
through the first half of the 1990s. In 1995 the city's peak electricity demand was
4,091 MW and consumption was 22,260 GWh, corresponding to a load factor of 62.1
percent. Generation in Beijing in that year was 13,000 GWh, so that 41.6 percent of
electricity consumed was imported, primarily from the West Inner Mongolia and Shanxi.
2.2  Inner Mongolia has proven reserves of more than 200 billion tons of good-quality
coal. Transport limitation have restricted the development of this potential. Therefore,
the central government is promoting the development of mine-mouth power plants in
inland coal rich provinces (especially Shanxi Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region) and transfer of electricity to important load centers.
2.3   There are two separate grids in Inner Mongolia, the East Inner Mongolia Power
Grid that is connected to the Northeast Power Network and the West Inner Mongolia
Power Grid (WIMPG) that is part of the north China power system. The WIMPG is a net
exporter of electricity. It is connected to the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power grid
(referred to as Jing-Jin-Tang power grid or JJTPG). The JJTPG is a major consuming
center owing to the concentration of high urban population and industries. Power
exchanges occur through two 500 kV lines (Datong to Fangshan) and (Fengzheng to
Shalingzi). There is also a 220 kV interconnection. The power and energy transmitted
from the WIMPG to the JJTPG are shown in Table 2.1.
TABLE 2.1: ELECTRICITY EXPORTS FROM THE WIMPG TO THE JJTPG
Annual
1990   1991   1992   1993   1994   1995   Growth (%)

Energy (GWh)     616    1,193   1,713   2,225   3,086   4,286    47
2.4   Starting from 1990, along with the increase of generating capacity and power
output, the WIMPG began to transfer power to the JJTPG. The electricity exports
increased sixfold during 1990-95 from 0.6 to 4.2 TWh. This trend is expected to



-14 -
continue since numerous studies (especially the joint SPC/World Bank study on
Investment Strategies for China's Coal and Delivery System and the least-cost study
carried out during the preparation of the proposed project) demonstrated the economic
and environmental benefits to generate power in the northwest coal bases and transfer it
to important load centers in the northeast. Inner Mongolia has been listed as the major
electric power base to supply energy to the Jing-Jin-Tang area. The Inner Mongolia
Electric Power Company (IMEPC) has plans to increase its power exports up to 10 GW,
half of its installed capacity by the year 2000.
B. LOAD FORECAST
2.5   The load forecasts for the WIMPG and the JJTPG during the period 1996-2010
were prepared by IMEPC and NCPGC for the Ninth Five-Year Plan. The load
forecasting is based on a combination of econometric and analytical methods. The
econometric methods are based on the premise that electricity conservation efforts would
be sustained to keep the 0.8-0.9 elasticity of electricity consumption to GNP experienced
in the early 1990s. The analytical methods are based on (a) market surveys and
development plans of the major electricity consumers to determine the sectoral output
growths, and (b) electricity intensities for the different sectors to determine future
electricity consumptions taking into account load management and electricity
conservation measures. The corresponding load forecasts are summarized in Table 2.2.

Annual Growth Rate (%)                       7.8         7.2         6.9
2.6   During the next decade, the peak demand would increase by about 14,000 MW in
JJTPG and about 2,000 MW in the WIMPG. While the capacity addition requirements in
the WIMPG are relatively modest, the potential for electricity transfer to the JJTPG and
the Beijing region is considerable. The proposed project (1,200 MW) accounts for less
than 10 percent of the capacity needed to alleviate shortages and meet future electricity
requirements in the JJTPG. It is highly unlikely that it will encounter significant market
risks even in case of full scale development of the site (3,600 MW).

C. THE ROLE OF THE PROJECT
2.7   The proposed project addresses development of the North China power system in
an integrated approach based on (a) increase of electricity supply through creation of an
independent generation company (TEPGC) to develop a mine-mouth power plant in Inner
Mongolia and insure adequate supply to the Jing-Jin-Tang area through long-term
contractual arrangements; and (b) a transmission and distribution (T&D) component
including investments in the transmission system to improve the reliability and quality of
supply in Beijing and in rehabilitation of a pilot distribution area to reduce losses and
improve efficiency.
2.8   The proposed project, located in Tuoketuo county of the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous region would ease the power shortage in the JJTPG area, which includes the
fast-growing municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin.  It was selected following
consideration of different alternatives, mainly construction of plants close to the load
centers in the JJTPG or construction of mine-mouth plants in Shanxi Province and
transmission of the electricity to the JJTPG. Building the facilities in Tuoketuo was
found to be the most economically and environmentally attractive option.
2.9    Overall, the project is expected to have the least detrimental impacts on the
environment, compared to available alternatives. The plants to be constructed under the
project will introduce the first two 600 MW baseload units in West Inner Mongolia
system. The units are designed to meet strict atmospheric emission standards and
minimize other environmental impacts. The new capacity additions will result in reduced
use, and retirement of older, less efficient and more polluting plants.
2.10  Investment in the transmission and distribution networks in Beijing over the last
decade have not kept pace with the increase in consumer demand. Consequently, the
systems, especially in the city center, are characterized by: (a) losses that are above
economic levels, (b) a reliability level that is lower than that appropriate for the country's
capital city, and (c) inadequate voltage regulation in some areas. To ensure adequate
supplies, it is necessary to introduce more injection points at higher transmission voltages
closer to the city center and to upgrade the heavily loaded distribution system. These
measures will improve supply reliability, reduce losses and improve the quality of
consumer service. The component will achieve these objectives through construction of
new substations, installing reactive compensation, increasing transformer capacities in
existing substations, installing more efficient distribution transformers and increasing the
sizes of conductors on many distribution lines. These investments are needed to ensure
that the power to be transmitted from the Tuoketuo power station to Beijing can be
efficiently relayed to end-users with accepted standards of quality.

3. THE BENEFICIARIES
3.1   There will be two beneficiaries of the proposed World Bank loan for the
implementation of two independent project components. The first beneficiary is the
Tuoketuo Electric Power Generation Company (TEPGC). TEPGC will be responsible
for the construction and operation of the first phase of the Tuoketuo coal-fired power
plant (2x600 MW) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The second beneficiary
is NCPGC. NCPGC will be responsible for the rehabilitation and reinforcement of the
T&D system in Beijing.
A. LEGAL STATUS AND ORGANIZATION OF THE BENEFICIARIES
3.2   TEPGC. TEPGC is a newly formed limited liability company established in May
1996 by three shareholders, including NCPGC, the Inner Mongolia Electric Power
Company (IMEPC) and the Beijing International Electric Power Development
Investment Company (BIEPDIC). Its registered capital is Y 2 billion. NCPGC holds 51
percent of the shares, IMEPC 34 percent and BIEPDIC 15 percent.
3.3   The Articles of Association (dated May 3, 1996) empower TEPGC to build and
operate the Tuoketuo power plant to improve the power supply in the Jing-Jin-Tang area,
especially Beijing Municipality. They also require the company "to continuously
increase the economic profits and obtain higher returns for the shareholders." Under
existing Chinese laws, TEPGC can raise funds from various sources, issue stocks and
bonds and enter joint-venture agreements with foreign companies. However, these
activities are still regulated and government approval are required at various levels.
TEPGC has the authority to receive part of the proceeds of the proposed World Bank loan
through the Central Government, to carry out the construction and the management of the
power plant, and to enter into a Project Agreement with the World Bank.
3.4   TEPGC is headed by a General Manager assisted by one to four Deputy General
Managers and a Financial Officer. The organizational structure of TEPGC is shown in
Chart 2.  TEPGC is currently assuming full responsibility for preparation and
implementation of the project.  Initially, the Tuoketuo Power Plant Preparatory
Department had been established with the responsibility for preparation of the power
station component of the project. The staff in the Preparatory Department in IMEPC
have been transferred to TEPGC and continue to perform their previous functions. The
organization and proposed staffing of TEPGC are suitable for building and managing
large thermal power plants. A total staff complement of 588 staff is planned-459
operations staff and 128 managerial and administrative staff.  During the initial
construction phase, about 80 managerial and administrative staff would be required, of
which 50 would be retained when the plant is commissioned.



- 17-
3.5   The Articles of Association also provide for the establishment of a Board of
Directors to represent the interests of the shareholders, appoint and dismiss the general
manager and high-level staff and supervise the management of the Company. Members
of the Board are appointed by the shareholders.
3.6   NCPGC. NCPGC is one of the largest companies in China with an asset base of
about Y 23 billion. It has 47 wholly-owned subsidiary enterprises, 55 enterprises with a
controlling interest and 29 enterprises with a minority stake. NCPGC runs and operates
North China Power Grid. It supplies power to an area of 1.47 million square kilometers,
covering Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi and West Inner Mongolia. NCPGC owns 62
power stations, 4 survey and design institutes, 19 power construction companies, 5 test
and research organizations and 11 manufacturing and repairing enterprises.
3.7   NCPGC is an independent legal entity possessing the status of a limited liability
company. Its charter has been formulated under the law on industrial enterprises, and the
State Council's regulation on "the Structural Reformation of the North China Power
Network." NCPGC's legal status and Charter require revision to conform with the 1994
Company Law following issuance of guidelines for restructuring state-owned enterprises
as companies (Article 21, Chapter 2 of the Company Law).
3.8   NCPGC is headed by a President assisted by six Vice Presidents, a Chief
Engineer and a Chief Economist. The organizational structure is shown in Chart 3. The
functions of NCPGC are outlined in its existing charter. These include construction of
power projects and raising funds from various sources. In practice, NCPGC obtains
investment funds from state and central government and through borrowing from policy
and local banks. NCPGC has also corporate power to issue bonds and shares with the
approval of relevant authorities. It has the authority to receive part of the proceeds of the
proposed World Bank loan through the Central Government, to carry out the proposed
T&D component, and to enter into a Project Agreement with the World Bank.
3.9   Following the approval of the proposed project, NCPGC intends to transfer its 51
percent shareholding in TEPGC to the Beijing Datang Power Generation Company
Limited (BDP). BDP is a joint stock limited company incorporated in China with limited
liability (see Box 3.1 for more details). On March 21, 1997, BDP completed a "H" Share
Offer comprising: (a) a public offering of 2.5 percent of the registered capital in the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange; (b) a private placement of
22.5 percent of the registered capital to professional and institutional investors worldwide
by selective marketing in different markets.' The transfer of NCPGC's equity share in
TEPGC to BDP has been approved in principle by MOEP. Formal approval of the
relevant Chinese authorities is now being sought. Following approval by the Chinese
authorities, the transfer will be discussed formally with the Bank. It is expected that
Given the success of the offering, the Share Offer has been increased from 25 to 27.7 percent of the
registered capital.



- 18 -
TEPGC would continue to remain a fully independent limited liability company. BDP
plans to use a portion of the proceeds of the "H" Share Offering to finance its equity in
TEPGC.
Box 3.1: BEIJING DATANG POWER GENERATION COMPANY LIMITED
The Beijing Datang Power Generation Company (BDP) is a joint stock limited company
incorporated in China with limited liability. The Company was established in December, 1994 by NCPGC
to develop, construct, own and operate coal-fired electric power plants within the NCPGC service area.
BDP currently owns and operates 3,150 MW of power generation capacity, making it one of the
largest independent power producers in China. BDP plans to develop, either solely or with other investors,
several additional plants with an aggregate planned installed capacity of 4,500 MW by the year 2002.
BDP's effective interest in this additional planned capacity (i.e., the aggregate of the capacity of each plant
multipled by BDP's percentage interest in each plant) is anticipated to be 2,532 MW.
On March 21, 1997, BDP successfully completed a public and private offering of 25 percent of its
registered capital. This comprised 1,244,060,000 H Shares with a nominal value of Y 1.00 each. Each
share was priced at HK$2.52 per share, which was payable at full on application. Of the total share
offering, 10 percent was listed publicly on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange,
and the remaining 90 percent placed with private institutional and professional investors worldwide by the
Underwriters to the issue. Given the success of the offering, the Share Offer has been increased from 25 to
27.7 percent of the registered capital.

B. PLANNING, BUDGET AND CONTROL
3.10  Power bureaus and companies are responsible for developing annual and five-year
production and investment plans, which are integrated into the national plans and are
approved, through MOEP's auspices, by SPC. In the past, financial planning was
confined to attaching monetary values, predetermined by MOEP, to the power production
being planned. Although a power bureau's plan might be revised to reflect changes, it
would ordinarily not be revised to reflect differences between estimated prices and actual
prices. However, with the economic changes in the 1980s, prices have begun to move
toward market levels and the Government now finances investments through loans rather
than grants. Centralized control is being relaxed and replaced by greater financial
autonomy and responsibilities for the power entities. To address these changes, both
TEPGC and NCPGC will need to design and implement modem financial planning and
management systems.
3.11  MOEP recognizes the importance of financial management in the power sector in
China and is promoting relevant training programs for all the power institutions under its
control. Many of the power bureaus/companies, including NCPGC, have been equipped
with personal computers and software for planning, budgeting, and accounting functions.
Information from the bureaus/companies can be transferred to MOEP and consolidated
into regional and national data.
3.12  These systems represent a good first generation of automated management
information; however, they still are not sufficient and integrated as a network to promptly
provide financial and related statistical information about a power entity's operations to
the various management levels, supplying each level with the necessary details at the
appropriate times. TEPGC and NCPGC also need to introduce accounting and financial
management systems that will: (a) enable managers to be held accountable for costs of
activities and functions over which they have control; (b) provide information for
comparative analysis of actual costs with budgets for decision-making; and (c) provide
transparency of information for investors, government, lenders, and the public in general.
The proposed project includes a technical assistance component to support TEPGC and
NCPGC in establishing appropriate systems and procedures to upgrade their budgeting
and financial accounting systems, including provision of software and hardware, as well
as enhancement of their staff skills. The terms of reference (TOR) for the proposed
studies under this project are presented in Annex 3.1 for TEPGC and in Annex 3.2 for
NCPGC. Assurances were obtainedfrom TEPGC and NCPGC during negotiations that
they will: (a) carry out the organizational restructuring and financial management
systems studies according to the schedule agreed with the Bank; and (b) implement the
recommended organizational improvements, and accounting and financial management
systems, taking into account Bank comments.

4. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.1   The proposed project is intended to:
(a)   increase electricity supply and electricity trade in North China through
creation of an independent power company to develop a mine-mouth
power plant in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region that will supply the
Jing-Jin-Tang grid through long-term contractual arrangements;
(b)   improve the efficiency of energy supply and use in the region by:
(i) introducing modem technologies and implementing effective
operations and maintenance practices and procedures in power generation,
and (ii) reducing losses in the T&D systems of Beijing;
(c)   advance the power sector reform process in China by promoting the
development of electricity trade in North China through adequate and
market-oriented commercial arrangements;
(d)   diversify financing sources, improve the access of power entities to
international financial markets, and encourage private-sector investment in
existing and new power sector enterprises;
(e)   promote economic development and also improve soil conservation and
desertification control in Tuoketuo county.
4.2   Project impact would be monitored with respect to the above objectives. The key
indicators are:
PO (a) (i)    High availability of power units of Tuoketuo Thermal Power
Station

Power Grid
PO (b) (i)   Increased efficiency and reliability of T&D in the Greater Beijing
Area
PO (c) (i)   Implementation and adherence to commercial terms in the power
purchase contract between TEPGC and NCPGC



- 21 -
(ii)    Development of framework for the creation of a wholesale power
market in North China
PO (d) (i)    Divestiture of one power plant
(ii)    Additional equity offering in a listed power company
(iii)   Participation of external investors in the expansion of an existing
power company
PO (e) (i)    Acceleration of economic growth
(ii)   Increase in afforestation rate in Tuoketuo county.
4.3   The achievement of the objectives would be tracked and monitored through
specific measurable targets.  Project implementation in terms of construction and
commissioning would be monitored as actual physical output or percentage of project
completion (power generated, number of trees planted, etc.), achievement of efficiency
and quality of supply goals (availability, supply interruptions, system losses), and
improvement of management and advances in power sector reform (financial targets,
diversification of financing sources). These are presented in Section K (Reporting and
Monitoring).
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
4.4   The project consists of two major components. The first and largest component is
the Tuoketuo thermal power plant and associated technical assistance. The second is the
Beijing T&D component. The respective beneficiaries are TEPGC and NCPGC.
Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant Component
4.5   The first component, under the responsibility of TEPGC, will include:
(a)   construction of the first two 600 MW coal-fired subcritical thermal units in
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as the first phase of the Tuoketuo
power station. These units will be equipped with on-line performance
monitoring systems to minimize coal consumption and gradually introduce
advanced maintenance techniques;
(b)   technical assistance to TEPGC for: (i) design and introduction of modern
accounting and financial management systems; (ii) construction
management and engineering services; (iii) environmental management
and monitoring; (iv) use of simulator and computerized systems to
develop operational staff capabilities in plant operation and management;
and (v) implementation of a plan for assets divestiture and involvement of
private investors in existing and new power projects in Inner Mongolia
(see para. 4.15); and



- 22 -
(c)   a desertification control and dryland management program to improve the
environmental conditions in Tuoketuo county.
4.6   The two generation units to be constructed under the proposed Tuoketuo thermal
power plant component consist of subcritical, drum-type boilers with low nitrogen oxide
(NOJ) burners, single-shaft condensing turbines and 600 MW generators. They share a
single 240 m stack. The plant's design coal is a blend of screened unwashed bituminous
coal with a calorific value of 4,300+500 kcal/kg, ash content of 26+4 percent and sulfur
content of 0.47 percent.  Emissions of particulates are minimized by electrostatic
precipitators with an efficiency of 99.76. The plant will also include an on-line
monitoring system to maximize efficiency and reduce coal consumption and provide
useful data for preventive maintenance (see Annex 4.1).
4.7   To transmit the electricity generated by the Tuoketuo thermal power plant to the
JJTPG grid, three 500 kV transmission lines and associated sub- and switching stations
will be constructed under a separate project that does not involve World Bank funding
(see Annex 4.1). Assurances were obtained during negotiations that NCPGC will
complete the 500 kV transmission lines and associated sub- and switching stations three
months prior to the commissioning of the first 600 MW unit of the Tuoketuo Thermal
Power Plant.
Beijing T&D Component
4.8   This second component, under the responsibility of NCPGC, will include:
(a)   construction of two 220 kV  indoor substations at Xibianmen and
Xizhimen respectively. Xibianmen will be equipped with two 250 MVA,
220/110/10 kV transformers and Xizhimen with two 200 MVA, 220/110/
10 kV transformers;
(b)   addition of a third 250 MVA  220/110/10 kV  transformer in the
underground Wangfujing substation, currently under construction; and
(c)   technical assistance to NCPGC for implementing accounting and financial
management systems.
In connection with, and to complement, this project, NCPGC will undertake the
following program, approved separately and financed locally.
(a)   Replacement of overloaded and inefficient units in the Beicheng and
Huichengmen substations by four 50 MVA 110/10 kV transformers; and
(b)   upgrading of the distribution system in the heavily loaded, high-growth
Xizhimen area. The upgrading will involve reconductoring of insulated
overhead lines (approximately 75 km), and installation of five compact
10 kV transformer stations.
A detailed description is shown in Annex 4.2.

Project Design and Consulting Services
4.9   The Tuoketuo thermal power project feasibility study and design report were
completed by the North China Electric Power Design Institute (NCEPDI) in 1993, and
revised in June 1996. The project was approved by SPC in 1994. Following the Bank's
Guidelines, international engineering consultants were selected to assist in finalizing
designs, procurement of goods, engineering and design interface coordination and limited
construction supervision. Funding in the amount of $2.4 million out of the China
Reform, Institutional Support and Preinvestment Project [CRISPP (Credit 2447-CHA)]
has been provided for this purpose. The scope of the construction management and
supervision component will be broadened under the proposed project according to the
TOR provided in Annex 4.3. A first version of the Environmental Impact Assessment
Report (EIAR) was prepared in 1994 by NCEPDI. The report was revised with the
assistance of international consultants to conform with the Chinese and Bank
environmental procedures and guidelines for thermal power projects and finalized in May
1996. The EIAR has been approved by all Government authorities, and its summary was
distributed to the Executive Directors on May 28, 1996. The overall project concept and
design is satisfactory.
4.10 For the Beijing T&D component, designs, including load flows, fault level, and
stability studies, have been carried out by NCEPDI. NCEPDI has extensive experience in
the successful design of T&D systems as well as of other power infrastructure facilities.
The concept and design of the transmission facilities and the pilot project of distribution
rehabilitation to reduce losses is satisfactory.  Assistance is being provided by
international consultants through a Beijing T&D efficiency improvement study funded
under a Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) grant (see para. 4.32).
C. SECTOR REFORMS
4.11  One of the objectives of the proposed project is to assist and facilitate the power
sector reform process in the North China region. It will advance the power sector reform
process in two main areas: (a) development of contractual arrangements between TEPGC
(the Seller) and NCPGC (the Purchaser) that will be based on efficient commercial and
economic terms; and (b) assistance for divestiture of existing assets and/or involvement
of domestic or foreign private investors to raise additional capital for power system
expansion.
Contractual Arrangements
4.12  The project will provide technical assistance in establishing TEPGC, the first
independent power producer on the NCPGC system, as a financially autonomous and
commercially oriented enterprise. The assistance includes development of a detailed
power purchase agreement and dispatch rules that will govern the business relationships
between TEPGC (the seller) and NCPGC (the purchaser). Once the concept of an
independent generating enterprise has been successfully demonstrated, privately owned
facilities will be more easily accepted. The power purchase agreement developed under



- 24 -
the proposed project and signed on December 31, 1996 is a major step toward full
commercialization and business orientation of the power sector in China.  Future
agreements with other nonutility and privately owned producers as well will build on the
progress achieved.
4.13  The PPA reflects the principles agreed with the World Bank as a part of the
continuing dialogue on power sector reform in China. The most innovative legal features
of the PPA for a Chinese power project are: (a) risks are allocated based on widely
accepted financing and commercial practices; and (b) explicit definition of government
change-of-law and policy events with provision of legal recourse and protection for both
the seller and the purchaser. From an economic efficiency perspective, a two-part tariff
has been defined for the first time in a Chinese power sales contract with: (a) a capacity
charge covering debt and a minimum equity return if the plant meets minimum contracted
availability; (b) a capacity charge weighted to provide higher payments for peak
availability; (c) an energy charge reflecting only fuel and other variable costs-there is no
minimum energy generation (or take-or-pay) obligation, ensuring economic dispatch of
the facility; and (d) incentives built into the capacity charge to reduce overall scheduled
and unscheduled outage time for higher returns.
4.14 The project will also demonstrate the viability of the purchasing agency model,
which is becoming the standard approach to unbundling generation and transmission in
many other countries. The regional grid will purchase electricity from various generators
and sell to the distribution entities at prices that reflect the overall cost of supply. In
subsequent stages, the functions of the regional grid company would eventually be
limited to purchase of power from independent producers and other power generation
companies, ownership and operation of the transmission system (including dispatch), and
sale of power to the provincial utilities.
Assets Divestiture
4.15  During project processing, IMEPC prepared, with the assistance of international
consultants funded by Canadian Trust Funds, a plan aimed at increasing private and
nonutility investment in the Inner Mongolia Generation System. IMEPC's divestiture
plan includes: (a) additional equity offering of 15 million shares of Inner Mongolia
Mendian Huaneng Thermal Power Company in Shanghai (about Y 4/share is expected by
the underwriter for shares with a face value of Y 1/share) by mid-1997; (b) establishing a
limited liability company to support the sale of the Wulashan coal-fired power plant
(200 MW) to an independent Chinese operator by the end of 1997; and (c) involving
private investor(s) in further expansion and development of the Haibowan Electric Power
Company (2xlO0 MW  installed and 2x200 MW  under development).  Technical
assistance will be provided under the proposed project to carry out preparatory work to
implement IMEPC's plans for divestiture and involvement of private investors in existing
and new projects (see Annex 4.4).

D. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
4.16  In accordance with OD 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), the project has been
assigned to Category A. The Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared with
assistance of an international consultant specializing in environmental issues related to
thermal power plants, and has been approved by the Inner Mongolia Environmental
Protection Agency (IMEPA), and the National Environmental Protection Agency
(NEPA). The EA has been reviewed by the World Bank; it is considered that all
environmental aspects of the project are satisfactorily addressed with respect to all
Chinese and World Bank environmental regulations, policies, and procedures. The
project has been designed and will be implemented in accordance with modern concepts
of environmental management. Consequently, the project should cause minimum
disturbance to the environment. An environmental management unit (EMU) will be
established by the company (see Annex 4.5 for EMU TOR) and a consultant engaged to
assist in defining and operationalizing the EMU work program (see AnnexA4.6) for
Consultant TOR). An environmental monitoring program will be incorporated to
ascertain and verify these conditions on a sustained basis.
4.17  The project is a greenfield operation, located within the boundary of Yanshanying
a small village in a rural area of Tuoketuo County. The site is approximately 70 km
southwest of Huhhot City, the provincial capital of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
Three alternative locations for the power plant were considered.  All three were
satisfactory from an environmental perspective. The selected site was closest to the ash
disposal site with the most favorable geological conditions, was most convenient to
infrastructure (drainage, water supply, transportation facilities, etc.) and offered the best
natural geologic foundation for plant construction.
4.18  Modern pollution control technologies will be incorporated into the design of the
power plant, such as high-efficiency electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) and low NO,
burners. In addition, the plant layout provides adequate space to install additional
pollution control systems (e.g., flue gas desulfurization) if required, as a result of future
changes in Chinese emission standards and/or technological developments permit.
Annex 4.7. Part A provides a summary of key environmental issues associated with the
project, their anticipated potential impacts, the mitigation plan to assure these potential
impacts are minimized, the monitoring program with which actual environmental impacts
will be measured, compared with EA predictions and, if necessary, indicate further
actions to be taken. As mentioned above, further strengthening of TEPGC with respect to
environmental management capabilities will be included in the project, with the creation
of the EMU, acquisition of appropriate environmental monitoring equipment, and the
establishing of an automated environmental data management system (see Annex 4.7e
Parts B. C. and D). In addition, since it is anticipated that the power plant will act as a
nucleus for further economic development in the region, technical assistance (training,
both locally and abroad) will be provided through TEPGC to the environmental
protection bureaus (EPBs) of Inner Mongolia, Huhhot, and Tuoketuo so that they can



- 26 -
prepare an air quality management plan to ensure healthy air quality levels are preserved
in the region.
4.19  Environmental issues associated with the project (power station, transmission line,
railway connection and cooling water supply system) and addressed in the EA included
all concerns expressed by affected peoples in a series of public meetings. The local
population and the local authorities support the project and the mitigating measures
recommended in the EA. The technical assistance programs, mitigation and monitoring
programs presented in Annex 4.7 will be fully implemented.
4.20  Key issues addressed in the EA included: air pollution, (dust, SO2), noise, water
pollution (groundwater at the ash disposal site, and surface water contamination of the
Yellow River), electric field strength, bird flight patterns (transmission lines), industrial
hazards and worker safety, desertification control, and impacts of both construction and
operation labor forces on the local infrastructure and social structure. The distribution
system component is mostly rehabilitation and reinforcement of existing lines and
substations, and will not adversely impact the environment. Public safety will be
improved. No polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) will be utilized in the substations to be
financed, and bidding documents will note this restriction accordingly. MOEP provided
certification that the transformers that are to be replaced under the T&D component do
not contain PCBs (banned in China from the early 1970s). In addition, the proposed
project (two units of 600 MW each) is the first phase of an overall program to develop
3,600 MW at the Tuoketuo site. To anticipate any future adverse environmental
consequences, the EA examined both the immediate impacts of the proposed project
(1,200 MW), as well as cumulative impacts of the 3,600 MW program.
4.21  All mitigating measures (for air, water, solids, noise, electric field, etc.)
incorporated in the project are designed to meet appropriate Chinese requirements and/or
World Bank guidelines, whichever is stricter. In the absence of either, international
standards or codes of practice will be used. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that TEPGC will carry out the Environment Action Plan in a manner satisfactory to the
Bank. In addition, a soil conservation and desertification control subcomponent of the
project would contribute to the revegetation effort currently planned (see Annex 4.8).
The plan calls for the arrest of desertification through soil conservation techniques,
establishment of vegetative cover to combat wind erosion, and improvement of soil
microclimate, water retention and nutrient properties. The overall target for Tuoketuo
County is to establish a 40 percent forest cover. Local people will be employed in the
revegetation effort, with preference given to oustees.
E. RESETTLEMENT
4.22  The project design focused on minimizing the scope of resettlement. Where land
acquisition and demolition of existing housing are unavoidable, the Resettlement Action
Plans (RAPs) are proposed to ensure: (a) improvement of the standard of living of the
Project-Affected Persons (PAPs); (b) compensation of the villages for land and PAPs for
their lost assets at replacement values without depreciation; (d) compensation for the



- 27 -
disrupted infrastructure; and (e) establishment of adequate mechanisms for grievance and
appeals, and systems for internal independent monitoring. Both project components
involve land acquisition and/or relocation of population. Costs of land acquisition and
resettlement are estimated at Y 296.5 million for both components (see Annex4.92).
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) have been prepared to comply with appropriate
Chinese policies and/or World Bank guidelines (OD 4.30). Assurances were obtained
that the Borrower would ensure that the persons affected by the project are resettled in
accordance with the resettlement plans agreed with the Beneficiaries.
Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant
4.23  The plant requires: (a) acquisition of about 836 ha of land, of which 55.6 percent
is cultivated, and (b) demolition of about of 3,340 m  of old houses with poor access to
basic infrastructure and sanitation facilities. It will affect about 2,253 persons. RAPs
satisfactory to the Bank have been prepared for all subcomponents for which detailed
designs are already complete (power plant and ash disposal site). Future resettlement
activities related to the railway connection and the cooling water supply system (water
pumping station and pipeline) will be undertaken more than two years later. The designs
for these two subcomponents are being carried out by the Zhungeer Coal Industry
Company and the Yellow River Hydraulic and Water Resource Administration
Committee. The components are linked to broader development of the Zhungeer Coal
Mine-Fengzhen railway project and the management of the Yellow River. The RAPs for
these components will be prepared by mid-1997 following the completion of the design
of the railway connection and the cooling water supply system.
4.24  Arrangements for relocation, prepared in collaboration with local authorities and
the population affected by the project, are in line with Chinese national and provincial
policies. Special attention was given to the most vulnerable groups (households headed
by women, senior people and poorest households). The new village is within 300 meters
of the existing village, and 250 meters of the Huhhot-Zhungeer highway. All new houses
will be built of bricks and wood and are of higher quality than the old ones. New public
facilities will be provided in the new village such as a clinic, school, shopping and
cultural centers. Displaced farmers will continue their agricultural activities in the newly
reclaimed agricultural lands in new irrigation areas. Four motor-pumped wells will be
installed for irrigation purposes. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that TEPGC
will (a) carry out the resettlement program for the Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant and
ash disposal site in accordance with the agreed resettlement plan; and (b) prepare a RAP
for the railway connection and the cooling water supply system by September 30, 1997
and carry out the resettlement program as agreed with the Bank.
4.25  A Project Resettlement Office with six staff members has been established in
TEPGC to oversee the management and implementation of resettlement program. It will
be assisted by Tuoketuo County Resettlement Office and Yanshanying Township
Resettlement Office. Two senior members of the office have received training on
involuntary resettlement sponsored by MOF.

Beijing T&D
4.26 Xibianmen substation requires acquisition of 6,100 mn of land, demolition of 239
houses, and relocation of 935 persons. However, this program is part of a wider planned
program of urban renovation and development of Beijing under the responsibility of the
Beijing Municipal Construction Development Corporation (BMCDC). The majority of
residential houses to be demolished are old and hazardous with poor sanitation facilities.
There is no resettlement need for Wangfujing and Xizhimen because the former is an
underground substation under construction and the latter will be built using the site of the
existing 110 kV substation. The pilot project of distribution rehabilitation involves
mainly reconductoring and installation of compact transformers and capacitors and does
not require any resettlement. Households displaced by the Xibianmen substation will be
relocated in new apartment buildings with modem facilities in a close-by residential
areas. Assurances were obtained that NCPGC will carry out resettlement under the
Beijing T&D component according to the agreed resettlement plan.
4.27  A Project Resettlement Office has been established to oversee the resettlement
work related to Xibianmen substation. It consists of representatives from Beijing
Municipal Power Supply Company (BMPSC), which is a division of NCPGC, BMCDC,
the Government of Xicheng District, and Beijing Municipality.
Implementation Monitoring
4.28 TEPGC and NCPGC respectively contracted the Inner Mongolia Academy of
Social Science (IMASS) and the Beijing Social and Psychological Research Institute
(BSPRI) to monitor the resettlement activities and provide an independent evaluation of
resettlement. The monitoring and evaluation will be based on a sample of 10 to 15
percent of affected population. The objective of monitoring and evaluation is to ensure
that the resettlement program is implemented smoothly and that living conditions and
income of resettlers are fully restored.
F. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation Schedule
4.29 TEPGC will be responsible for implementation and operation of the Tuoketuo
thermal power plant component. Its organizational structure is shown in Chart 2.
Preparatory works including access roads and construction power supply started in
October 1996 and have been progressing satisfactorily. The bidding documents for the
procurement of the main boiler and turbine-generator packages were issued in April 1997
and are scheduled to be opened in September 1997. The commercial operation of the first
generating unit is expected in October 2001 and the second unit in September 2002.
Thus, the project completion date would be January 2004 and the closing date of the
Bank loan would be July 31, 2004. Chart 4 presents the implementation schedule for the
power plant. Furthermore, key dates of project implementation are given in Annex 4.10.
4.30 NCPGC will be responsible for execution of the Beijing T&D component
including construction, commissioning and operation. NCPGC has had substantial



- 29 -
experience in power generation, T&D, and has been operating the North China Power
Grid since 1987. Beijing Power Supply Design Institute (BPSDI) and NCEPDI will
undertake preparation of technical bidding documents, bids evaluation, detailed
construction design and supply of drawings for, respectively, Xizhimen and Wangfujing
and Xibianmen.  BPSDI and NCEPDI have both design experience in 220 kV
substations. Construction of the works will be the responsibility of the construction
department of BMPSC. The construction department also has extensive experience in the
relevant area. The bidding documents for the items to be procured under ICB packages
are scheduled to be issued in June 1997. Completion of the T&D component is planned
for August 1999. Key dates for implementation are given in Annex 4.10 and the
component implementation schedule is given in Chart 5.
Management Development and Training
4.31  To meet TEPGC's long-term staffing requirements and to further develop
TEPGC's management capability, a comprehensive technical assistance and training
program  is included under the proposed project.  It consists of the following:
(a) technical assistance to implement accounting and financial management systems (see
para. 3.12 and Annex 3.1); (b) training in utility management and financial planning;
(c) project-related training for technical staff; and (d) upgrading of and equipment for
TEPGC's training facilities. It is planned that all the technical staff will be trained in
various fields, totaling 1,325 staff-months of training in China and abroad (see Annex
4.11). Assurances were obtained from TEPGC that it will carry out the management
development and training program as agreed with the Bank.
4.32 NCPGC's planning and management capability will be strengthened through
training and studies. A technical assistance program is included to assist NCPGC to
implement accounting and financial management systems (see para. 3.12 and Annex 3.2).
A Beijing T&D efficiency improvement study is being carried out to develop a program
of investments and other measures that would reduce power losses on the Beijing T&D
systems to economic levels and ensure acceptable quality and reliability of power
supplies to end-consumers. The study is funded through a PHRD grant for an amount of
$960,000. The study will strengthen NCPGC's planning capability through technology
transfer and on-the-job training in advanced planning methodology and provision of
hardware and software for transmission and distribution system analyses.
G. COST ESTIMATE
4.33  The total cost of the project is estimated at $1,103.6 million equivalent, excluding
interest during construction (IDC), including both the Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant
($954.8 million) and the Beijing T&D component ($148.8 million), of which $500.0
million (45.3 percent) represents the foreign exchange component. Table 4.1 provides a
summary of the estimated project cost. The cost estimates reflect mid-1996 prices and
are based on the recent tendering information available for similar projects, including
prices for major generating equipment and control systems. Physical contingencies are
calculated at 10 percent for civil works and locally supplied equipment and 5 percent for

1998, 6.5 for 1999 and thereafter. The prevailing exchange rate during preappraisal
(Y 8.3257=$1) is used in the cost estimates.
H. FINANCING PLAN
4.34 The total financing requirements (including IDC of $187.2 million equivalent) are
estimated at $1,290.8 million equivalent. The financing plan for the overall project is
shown in Table 4.2. The financing required for the Tuoketuo thermal power plant
component is estimated at $1,108.4 million equivalent, including IDC of $153.6 million
equivalent. The local costs estimated at $524.8 million equivalent, IDC for both local
and foreign loans estimated at $153.6 million equivalent and working capital estimated at
$6.0 million equivalent will be provided by equity contribution and local borrowings
raised by the three shareholders. Their equity contribution is estimated at $277.2 million
equivalent, representing 25 percent of the total cost of the component. The remaining
financing requirements of about $401.2 million equivalent will be covered through bond
issues and borrowings by the three shareholders proportionally to their respective shares
in TEPGC, specifically, 51 percent by NCPGC, 34 percent by IMEPC, and 15 percent by
BIPDIC.
4.35  The foreign cost of the thermal power plant component, excluding IDC of $64.1
million, estimated at $430 million will be covered by the proposed Bank loan of $330
million and commercial cofinancing of about $100.0 million. The borrower of the
commercial cofinancing would be the People's Republic of China represented by MOF,
and the proceeds of the financing would be onlent to TEPGC under the same
arrangements as the Bank loan. It is expected that the central government, represented by
the Ministry of Finance, will seek amortized syndication loans with 15-year maturities
from commercial banks/insurance companies with a LIBOR-based floating interest rate to
better match the project's cash flow.  The Government gave assurances that the
commercial cofinancing will be in place in December 1998. It is expected that provision
of an optional cross-default clause by the Bank would be sufficient to secure adequate
loan terms. However, if required by market conditions, the Bank would consider
provision of a credit guarantee to extend maturity and lower the cost of commercial
borrowings by China. The Bank would then require a Government counterindemnity
against covered risks and would charge a guarantee fee of 0.25 percent per year of the
Bank exposure under the guarantee. Such a guarantee operation, if required, would be
submitted to the Board for approval on a stand-alone basis.
4.36 The financing required for the Beijing T&D component is estimated at $182.4
million equivalent, including IDC of $33.6 million equivalent. The proposed Bank loan
of $70 million will finance the foreign cost of the investment. The local costs estimated
at $78.8 million equivalent and the IDC for both foreign and local loans of $33.6 million
equivalent will be covered by self-financing from NCPGC and loans from SDB, Beijing
Municipality, and Hebei Province.

4.37 The proposed Bank loan of $400 million will be made to the People's Republic of
China at the Bank's standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency
loans, with a maturity of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period. Proceeds of the loan
would be onlent from the Government to TEPGC and NCPGC on the same terms and
conditions as the Bank loan. TEDGC and NCPGC will bear the foreign exchange risk.
TEPGC and NCPGC have selected LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loan terms
for the project to: (a) facilitate management of the foreign exchange risk of their
borrowing by more closely matching the currency of their liabilities with that of their net
trade flows, about 75 percent of which are US dollar denominated; and (b) preserve the
full maturity of the loan and the lower annuity payment in early years. The fixed-rate
option would have resulted in a 15-year loan and higher annual payments during the
initial operational period.
4.38  Assurances were obtainedfrom the Government that it would onlend the proceeds
of the proposed Bank loan to TEPGC and NCPGC under subsidiary loan agreements



- 33 -
with a term of 20 years, including 5-year grace period, at a variable rate equal to the
Bank rate. TEPGC and NCPGC will bear the foreign exchange risk. Execution of the
subsidiary loan agreements between the Government and both TEPGC and NCPGC,
satisfactory to the Bank and approval of the Loan Agreement by the State Council would
be conditions of loan effectiveness.
I. PROCUREMENT
4.39 Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3 and the related
procurement schedules for various packages are given in Annex 4.12. The Bank's
Procurement Guidelines (published in January 1995 and revised in January and August
1996) will be applied to all Bank-financed procurement. The Bank loan will be largely
disbursed against major plant equipment, boiler and turbine-generator packages and part
of the T&D equipment and materials through international competitive bidding (ICB).
Other procurement packages, such as instrumentation and control, 500 kV electrical
equipment, ash-handling equipment, etc., will be funded by commercial bank/insurance
company loans. For procurement of goods not financed by the Bank, the Borrower may
adopt other procurement procedures. In such cases, the Bank shall be satisfied that the
procedures fulfill the Borrower's obligations to cause the project to be carried out
diligently and efficiently. Prequalification of bidders is not required because the
equipment to be procured under the project is "quasi-standardized" (i.e., the technical
specifications are clearly specified and all potential suppliers are familiar with the
Chinese market). Postqualification of bidders will be based on criteria set out in the
bidding documents. Some specialized equipment estimated to cost less than $300,000
per contract up to an aggregate amount of $6 million for the thermal power plant
component and $1.2 million for the Beijing T&D component and which can only be
purchased from a limited number of suppliers, regardless of the cost thereof, will be
procured through limited international bidding (LIB).  Goods, instruments and
accessories needed for construction and operation of the power plant, including
equipment for environmental monitoring and training, which are readily available off-the-
shelf or are standard specification commodities, and which are estimated to cost less than
$300,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount of $2.5 million for the thermal power
plant component and $600,000 for the Beijing T&D component, will be procured through
contracts awarded on the basis of (a) international shopping procedures for up to an
aggregate amount not to exceed $2 million for the thermal power component and
$400,000 for the T&D component, or (b) national shopping procedures for up to an
aggregate amount not to exceed $500,000 for the thermal power plant component and
$200,000 for the Beijing T&D component. Goods of a proprietary nature may be
procured through direct contracting with the Bank's prior agreement up to an aggregate
amount not to exceed $500,000 for the thermal power plant component and $200,000 for
the Beijing T&D component.

4.40  Five contracts amounting to about $7.3 million in total for consulting services for
the two components will be awarded in accordance with Bank Guidelines for Use of
Consultants (August 1981). These include: engineering consultant for construction
management (one contract); organizational restructuring and financial management
systems (two contracts); consulting services for environmental aspects (one contract); and
legal and financial services for asset divestiture. For complex, time-based assignments,
such contracts shall be based on the standard form of contract for consultants' services
issued by the Bank, with such modifications thereto as shall have been agreed by the
Bank.
4.41  In ICB procurement, model bidding documents developed in consultation with the
Bank would be used. Standard bid evaluation forms for procurement of Goods and
Works (April 1996) would be used. Qualified domestic manufacturers would be eligible
for a margin of preference of 15 percent of the CIF price or the actual customs duty,
whichever is lower, in the evaluation of bids.
4.42  Because of foreign exchange limitations, civil works (fully locally financed) and
non-Bank-financed equipment will be procured locally through competitive bidding
procedures acceptable to the Bank. The procurement procedures for non-Bank-financed
components will not adversely affect the execution of the project in terms of cost, quality
or completion time.
4.43  Prior review would apply to all Bank-financed contracts for goods, with an
estimated cost of $5 million equivalent or above (about 94 percent of the loan). Other
contracts would be subject to selective postaward review. Prior review would also be
required for all consultancy contracts with an estimated cost exceeding $50,000 for
individuals, or $100,000 for firms. Exceptions to prior review would not apply to the
TOR for all consultancy contracts and single-source selection of consulting firms.
4.44  The invitation to prequalify or bid for each contract estimated to cost $10,000,000
equivalent or more shall be advertised in accordance with the procedures applicable to
large contracts under para. 2.8 of the Guidelines.
J. DISBURSEMENT
4.45  The Bank loan will be disbursed against:  (a) 100 percent of the foreign
expenditures for directly imported equipment and materials quoted on a CIF basis;
(b) 100 percent of local expenditures ex-factory for locally manufactured items, and 75
percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally; and (c) 100 percent of the
expenditure for consulting services and training. For expenditures pertaining to goods
contracts valued at less than $5,000,000 (except for the first three such contracts),
consultancy contracts valued at less than $100,000 for firms and $50,000 for individuals
and all training, reimbursement will be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures.
Supporting documents need not be submitted to the Bank but will be retained in
TEPGC's and NCPGC's office for review by Bank supervision missions. To facilitate
disbursements under this project, a Special Account will be established for each



- 36 -
Beneficiary with an authorized allocation of $15 million for TEPGC and $8 million for
NCPGC, representing approximately four months of average project disbursements.
Applications for replenishment will be submitted monthly or when the amounts
withdrawn equal 50 percent of the initial deposit, whichever comes sooner. Annex 4.13
presents the disbursement schedule for the proposed  Bank  loan  as well as a standard
profile of disbursements for power sector in China. The disbursements are expected to be
completed in six years for the power plant and three years for the T&D component, very
close to the standard disbursement profile for the power sector in China. The last year is
for payment of retention money. The annual estimated contractual and other payments
are presented in Table 4.4.

K. REPORTING AND MONITORING
4.46  Understandings were reached at appraisal concerning procedures and satisfactory
performance indicators for monitoring and reporting.  Reporting would include
semiannual project implementation reports covering all project components. A rolling
financial plan would also be submitted annually. The scope and content of the project
progress reports have also been agreed. The Bank supervision plan attached in Annex
4.14 will focus on the core activities of project implementation and achievement of
agreed objectives. The Key Project Performance Indicators are described in Annex 4.15.
4.47  With regard to the construction of the Tuoketuo power plant, monitoring of costs,
quality and schedule is the main function of TEPGC and their consultants during the
coming years. The Bank will monitor procurement progress in accordance with the
procurement schedule in Annex 4.12, and construction progress in accordance with the
schedule of Charts 4 and 5 and key dates presented in Annex 4. 10. Overall costs will be
monitored in accordance with Table 4.1. The guiding principles and implementation
indicators for the resettlement are or will be described in the RAPs submitted to the Bank
or covenanted under the proposed project.  The responsibility for environmental
monitoring is comprehensively presented in Annex 4.7.

5. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. BACKGROUND
5.1   TEPGC is a newly created corporation. In the medium term, its activities will be
dominated by the construction and subsequent operation of the proposed project.
TEPGC's operation and finances are interrelated with those of NCPGC; sole purchaser of
all power generated by the proposed two units. Both TEPGC and NCPGC follow MOF
financial regulations applicable to state-owned enterprises.
5.2   The financial regulations promulgated by MOF have gradually evolved over the
last decade from a system in which all investment funds were provided by the
Government and all surpluses remitted to it, to one which provides some autonomy and
incentives for efficiency. Overall, the new accounting principles effective July 1, 1993
are generally consistent with international accounting standards and financial rules. They
will, together with the rationalization of state assets management, and other fiscal and
financial sector reforms, further increase the accountability of the management of power
entities.
5.3   The Government promulgated a series of important tax laws at the end of 1993.
An unified corporate income tax rate of 33 percent is being applied to all domestic
enterprises. A new 17 percent value-added tax (VAT) replaced the old 25 percent sales
tax for power generation and distribution. The new tax policy is more transparent and
eliminates the lengthy and complicated negotiations between enterprises and the
Government. It is also conducive to better planning and financial management in the
power companies.
5.4   One of the Government's sectoral objectives is to strengthen the enterprises'
financial management so that the power companies could perform their increased
financial role effectively. Toward this end, the proposed project would focus on the
institutional building aspect and include (a) technical assistance to develop and improve
the accounting and financial management systems of both beneficiaries (para. 3.11); and
(b) agreements with TEPGC and NCPGC on financial performance targets to ensure
disciplined and sound financial management (paras. 5.7 and 5.15).
B. TEPGC's FINANCES
5.5   As TEPGC is a new company and has very few activities, the past financial
performance of the three sponsors, including NCPGC, IMEPC, and BIEPDIC, were
reviewed and found satisfactory. The review was focused on the cash flow situation of
each entity in order to assess the availability of funds to finance the proposed project.

Financial Performance Targets
5.6   The self-financing ratio used in other power projects in China is not adequate to
monitor TEPGC's financial performance. TEPGC is an independent (nonutility) power
producer, and unlike power utilities, its activities do not require regular investments.
Moreover, development of subsequent phases may take time and could involve other
domestic and/or foreign investors. Therefore, a rate of return on equity has been selected
because it is a performance indicator commonly recognized in financial markets and
widely used by the power industry. Moreover, it is consistent with the tariff fornula set
in the power purchase agreement signed by TEPGC and NCPGC.
5.7   With a view to promoting prudent financial management, assurances were
obtained from TEPGC that it would:
(a)   take all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff
adjustments, to earn an annual return on equity (defined as the total
unimpaired paid-in captial) of not less than 20 percent in 2003 and
thereafter;
(b)   take all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff
adjustments, to ensure its internal cash generation would provide a debt
service coverage ratio of no less than 1.3 times during 2001-03, and 1.5
times thereafter; and
(c)   by April 30 of each year, furnish to the Bank a rolling eight-yearfinancial
plan containing projected income statements, sources and uses of funds,
and balance sheets.
Future Finances
5.8   As noted above (para. 4.12), a power purchase agreement has been signed
between TEPGC and NCPGC, which provides for a rate of return of 15 percent on equity
investment after the distribution of net income for 30 percent of principal repayment and
allocation of 15 percent for two funds during the first 10 years' operation and 20 percent
during the remaining years to ensure TEPGC's financial viability. Based on the
assumptions detailed in Annex 5.2, including electricity tariff setting that would allow
TEPGC to achieve the above financial performance targets, projections of TEPGC's
finances for the period 2001-2008 are presented in Annex 5.1. Salient features of
TEPGC's future finances are highlighted in Table 5.1.
5.9   Revenue Position. The first unit is scheduled to be commissioned in 2001 and
the second unit in 2002. The two units would become fully operational on a commercial
basis in 2003. The financial forecast indicated that the average tariff would be about 35.8
fen/kWh in 2001 (24.05 fen in end-1995 prices), which confirms the competitiveness of
the Tuoketuo Power Plant. The consequent cash generation is projected to be sufficient
to cover the debt service requirements. During the first eight years of its operations, the



- 40 -
average tariff that would allow TEPGC to achieve the agreed financial performance
targets and meet the required net income distribution is estimated at 47.8 fen/kWh in
current terms and 25.6 fen/kWh in 1995 prices.

5.10   TEPGC's Board of Directors decided to staff and operate the proposed power
plant according to international standards and best commercial practices to minimize
operating expenses. TEPGC is therefore expected to have a low operating ratio, which
will not exceed 48.2 percent during its first eight years of operation (2001-08). Its
average rates of return on historically valued and revalued net fixed assets, projected at
8.8  and  6.9  percent respectively, are  also  satisfactory.   However, debt service
requirements would be substantial. Specifically, debt service is forecast to account for an
average of 66 percent of TEPGC's operating income during the first eight years of
operation.
5.11    Funds Flow. During the project implementation period (1996-2002), TEPGC's
financing plan would be dominated by the proposed project. After commissioning of the
project, TEPGC is expected to generate substantial internal cash. As NCPGC would be
the sole customer and is expected to maintain a sound liquidity position (para. 5.22), no
problem is envisaged regarding collection of payments. However, as noted above, the
corporation would have a heavy debt service burden. The projected minimum tariff
requirements are mainly determined by the agreed debt service coverage ratio during
2003-08.
5.12    Capital Structure.  As required by the rule recently set by SPC  for all new
companies, three sponsors will invest equity shares equivalent to 25 percent of the project
investment cost in TEPGC. Within the first eight years of project operation, TEPGC's
capital structure is expected to improve considerably through retention of earnings and



- 41 -
loan repayments. During the same period, its debt/equity ratio is forecast to improve
from a peak of 71/29 in 2001 to 43/57 in the year 2008.
C. NCPGC's FINANCES
Past Finances and Present Financial Position

La Excluding VAT and other taxes.
5.14 NCPGC's financial performance in the past was generally satisfactory. During
the period 1993-95, NCPGC reported very modest profits with both net profitability on
equity and assets basis in the range of 2 to 3 percent. NCPGC's operating revenue
increased by 41 percent from 1993 to 1995 due to higher average tariff and energy sales.
However, its operating expenses increased even faster at a rate of 43 percent over the
same period as a result of over 60 percent increase of all operating expenses, except fuel
expenditures (8.5 percent). NCPGC has maintained a relatively conservative capital
structure with debt not exceeding 60 percent of total debt and equity over years. Its
liquidity position has been rather comfortable at levels over 1.5 in the past three years.
However, NCPGC's current tariff level is below the long-run marginal cost.
Financial Performance Targets
5.15  To promote prudent and sound financial management and adequate tariffs,
assurances were obtainedfrom NCPGC that it would:



- 42 -
(a)   take all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff
adjustments, to ensure its internal cash generation would provide a debt
service coverage ratio of no less than 1.5 times at all times;
(b)   take all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff
adjustments, to earn an annual return on equity of not less than 8 percent
in 1998, 10 percent in 1999-2000, and 12 percent thereafter, and
(c)   by April 30 of each year, furnish to the Bank a rolling eight-year financial
plan containing projected income statements, statements of sources and
uses offunds, and balance sheets.
5.16  Achievement of these objectives will require substantial tariff increases.
Projections, presented in Table 5.3, show that NCPGC's average price must increase by a
minimum of about 16.7 percent (over 9.2 percent in real terms) per year from 1995 to
2001 so as to achieve a rate of return on equity of 12 percent.
Future Finances
5.17  The projections of NCPGC's finances for 1996-2003 are presented in Annex 5.4,
and the salient features of these finances are highlighted below in Table 5.3. The
projections are based on the assumptions contained in Annex 5.5.
5.18  Table 5.3 shows the projected price increases of purchased power, NCPGC's self-
generated power, and the weighted average of those two that will be required to meet the
financial covenants. The prices for purchased power will be determined on a plant-by-
plant basis, at "debt service price" levels, allowing for full debt service based on a seven
to eight-year payback period after commissioning of new power plants.
5.19  NCPGC's financial position, however, depends mostly on revenues that it collects
from its self-generated power. In order to meet the expansion plan and projected cost
increases in the future and comply with the financial performance targets set forth above,
NCPGC' s average sale price will need to increase by an estimated 15.2 percent in current
terms or 7.9 percent in real terms a year from 1995 to 2003. Given the current low
catalog prices, 20.4 fen/kWh in 1995, the average price of NCPGC's self-generated
power needs to triple over the period.
5.20  Although the rates of increase in the catalog prices needed for NCPGC are large,
much of the increase should stem from the entry of new generating plant into the rate
base. Because of the rapid load growth, the bulk of the tariff increase required will be
met through implementation of the new pricing principles. At the end of 1996, more than
half of NCPGC's own generation came from plants built since 1993.

5.21   During the period 1996-2003, NCPGC needs to maintain relatively high rates of
growth to meet the electricity demand required by the sustained strong economic growth
in the North China region. Based on the latest demand forecast and expansion plan
assumptions, energy sales are expected to rise by 85.1 percent over 1995 levels,
representing an average annual growth rate of about 8 percent. NCPGC's annual
investment program and net fixed assets in operation are expected to increase by 5.0- and
4.5-fold over the period, an annual increase of about 25 and 24 percent, respectively.
5.22   From 1996 on, NCPGC's performance is anticipated to improve gradually and
steadily as the tariff level of NCPGC's own generation is increased to meet the financial
targets, from 23 fen/kWh in 1995 to 83.3 fen/kWh in 2003 and tariff structure is further
rationalized. The debt service requirement emerges as an important determinant of future
price levels. Based on the projected minimum tariff level, about 17.5 percent increase per
year for its own generation and 10.8 percent for purchased power from 1995 to 2003,
both revenues and net income are expected to grow considerably over the period.
NCPGC is also expected to maintain a sound liquidity position with an average current
ratio of 1.42 over the projection period. The rate of return on historically valued assets
and on revalued assets will improve considerably during 1996-2003.
D. AUDIT
5.23   Under the proposed project, both TEPGC and NCPGC's accounts will be audited
by the Foreign Investment Audit Bureau of the State Audit Administration (SAA). This
arrangement is satisfactory. Assurances were obtained from TEPGC and NCPGC that



- 44 -
they would (a) maintain and provide to the Bank semiannual progress reports with
unaudited project accounts to reflect project expenditures for the period under report
compared with the original project cost estimates; (b) furnish the Bank with the audited
accounts for the project, statements of expenditures, andfinancial statements of TEPGC
and NCPGC within six months of the end of each fiscal year; (c) implement any changes
to its accounting practices as recommended by their financial management consultants to
meet international accounting standards; and (d) require their auditors to comply with
international auditing practices and provide audit plans prior to each audit. For the first
audit report, the auditors are expected to provide: (a) a summary of the effects of
accounting changes arising from the adoption of new MOF regulations and corrections of
any deviations from MOF regulations as interpreted with reference to international
accounting standards and practices; and (b) a management letter summarizing any
significant matters that may have arisen during the conduct of the audit.

6. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISK
A. POWER PLANT
Least Cost Analysis
6.1   The Jing-Jin-Tang area is very important and fast growing industrial and
commercial base in China. However, it has limited electricity generation potential with
very limited hydroelectric and coal resources. During the last decade, it relied mostly on
imported coal from Shanxi Province and Inner Mongolia for its power generation.
However, because of environmental concerns, scarcity of adequate generation sites and
overload of the railway system, NCPGC started importing power from mine-mouth
power plants in Inner Mongolia and Shanxi Province to meet the surging demand in the
Jing-Jin-Tang area.
6.2   During the preparation of the project, a least-cost expansion study was carried out
by the Beijing Economic Research Institute for Water Resources and Electric Power
(referred to as BERI), covering 1998-2025 (study period) with a focus on 1998-2010
(planning period).  The study was carried out using an optimization model that
determines the optimal capacity and generation mix to meet the demand with the
minimum cost (net present value of investment and operating costs), given a
predetermined reliability criteria. It considered all potential candidates including: power
imports from different coal-fired power plants in Inner Mongolia and Shanxi Province
(300 and 600 MW units), 300 MW distillate fueled combined cycle units, 300 and 600
MW coal-fired units in the Jing-Jin-Tang area, hydropower and pumped storage plants,
and gas turbines (100 MW units). Considering economic costs for all candidates
(including transmission costs in case of electricity transfer) and a discount rate of 12
percent, the study showed that the expansion program should, up to the year 2010, be
based mostly on 300 MW and 600 MW subcritical coal-fired units (preferably in Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region or Shanxi Province) for base load and gas turbines and
pumped storage plants for peak load 2 The proposed project is the first investment of the
optimal (least-cost) power development program.
6.3   Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the proposed project, which
remains the first investment of the expansion program under a wide range of
assumptions:
2 Introduction of this highly automated and sophisticated technology in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region is considered an unacceptable risk by the Beneficiary (and the Chinese Government). However,
the least-cost study showed that supercritical units are less economically attractive because of the low
economic coal price in Inner Mongolia and Shanxi.



- 46 -
(a)   The project will still be required by year 2001-02, even if the demand
growth would slow from the projected 9 percent per year to only 6 percent
during 1995-2000, and from about 8 percent per year to 5.5 percent during
2000-2005;
(b)   The project would be less economical than an equivalent combined cycle
power plant only if the cost of distillate were more than 70 percent lower
than in the base case ($40 per ton of coal equivalent, $1.5 per MBtu,
compared to $141 per ton of coal equivalent, $5.2 per MBtu). Distillate
has been considered because of nonavailability of gas in North China in
the foreseeable future; and
(c)   The project remains the first investment of the least-cost program and is
still needed in 2001-02 even if the discount rate is increased from 12 to 14
percent.
6.4   The balances between power demand and supply are presented in Annex 6.1.
They demonstrate that the power system will be short of energy supply up to the year
2005.
Economic Rate of Return
6.5   The internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the proposed project was
calculated based on the estimated plant gate power price of 33 fen/kWh (in 1995 prices)
in 2001, the first year of operation. This estimate is based on prices paid to the newest
baseload power plants selling power to NCPGC in 1995, according to existing policies
for pricing of power output from new power plants. It yielded an IERR of about 18.9
percent. This IERR, based on revenues generated by the new power plant rather than the
economic value of a shortfall in electric power supply, underestimates the economic
benefits of the project.
6.6   The IERR would decrease to the test discount rate of 12 percent, in the case of
one of the following occurrences:
(a)   the price paid at the plant gate for electricity were about 28 percent lower
than the base case price: i.e., 24 fen/kWh instead of 33 fen/kWh in 1995
prices;
(b)   the project were to experience a cost overrun of about 55 percent;
(c)   the power plant operation were reduced to about 4,200 hours per year
instead of about 6,000 hours;
(d)   the economic fuel cost were 140 percent higher than the base case;

(e)   the project were to experience a delay in commissioning of more than
three years.
6.7   However, these occurrences are very unlikely because China has a very good
record in project implementation, the economic assumptions considered in the base case
are conservative, and the power purchase agreement and the financial covenants of the
project would ensure that prices are high enough to meet the economic viability
requirements.
Environmental Benefits
6.8   BERI also conducted an economic evaluation of the environmental impacts of the
project based on the "Benefits Transfer Method." It used: (a) the New York Externality
Model (Rowe et al., 1994) to determine adjusted estimate of the monetary damages
caused by air pollution during the study period, taking into account the location of the
power plant, the emission level and the population affected, and (b) estimates of average
annual climate change for carbon emissions to evaluate the monetary damages caused by
greenhouse gas emissions.
6.9   The results of the study showed that if the economic cost of the environmental
impacts is added to the project costs, the IERR would be reduced by 2.3 percent, 16.6
percent instead of 18.9 percent in the base case. It also confirmed that the economic cost
of the environmental impacts of the proposed project is lower than the economic cost of
the environmental impacts of a comparable power plant in the Jing-Jin-Tang area. If the
cost differential is added to the benefits of the proposed project, the IERR would increase
to 19.7 percent.
Project Risk
6.10  To complement the above deterministic analysis, risk analyses have been
performed using a probabilistic approach to assess the impact of the perceived risk factors
that affect the return of the project.
6.11  Four broad categories of risk have been considered in the analysis:
(a)   Demand Risk. Demand risk is related to lower load growth than expected
and/or breach of contract by the purchaser. Demand risk is not perceived
as a major risk factor in the short term with energy shortages prevailing in
the Jing-Jin-Tang grid. However, a low-load growth and/or an important
reduction in electricity off take could jeopardize the economic viability of
the project.
(b)   Price Risk. Price risk is related to the willingness and ability of the power
purchaser to pay and/or changes in pricing policy. This risk is normally
mitigated or managed through long-term contractual arrangements.



- 49 -
However, experience shows that the seller could still be confronted to
unexpected price changes.
(c)    Cost Risk.  Higher-than-estimated project cost usually results from:
(i)higher equipment prices.  The major equipment and facilities of
generation will be purchased through international competitive bidding.
Prices could therefore be affected by market fluctuations; (ii) construction
cost overrun. Cost overrun during construction period is a common
phenomenon for many infrastructure projects. They are caused by a
number of factors, in particular, delay of construction due to interfacing
problems between different suppliers, unforeseen site conditions and
inadequate construction management; and (iii) coal prices. Coal prices
increase would result in a major operating cost increase of the power plant.
It is likely that the coal price would stay stable in the initial years.
However, it is possible that at later stages of the project lifetime there
might be a coal price increase due to more stringent environmental
constraints (higher price for better quality coal, requirement to wash the
lower quality coal, etc.).
(d)    Operational Performance Risk. Poor operational performance could be
caused by:  (i) low  quality of generating equipment and facilities,
(ii) below standard coal, and (iii) inadequate maintenance and poor
management.
6.12   Based on the foregoing considerations and extensive sensitivity analyses, five
variables have been selected as the crucial risk variables because of their significant
impact on the project economic viability. Table 6.2 presents the selected variables, the
assumed value ranges and the probability distributions attached to them based on past
Bank experience in power projects in general and China in particular.
6.13   The risk analysis was carried out with the Risk Master computer software, which
uses Monte Carlo simulation3 technique. The spreadsheet employed for the risk analysis
is based on the base case cost/benefit analysis (see Table 6.1). The correlation between
risk variables is explicitly considered prior to the simulation to avoid generation of
unrealistic project scenarios. For instance, variations of output and cost are correlated
with the construction lead time.
6.14 The results, based on 1,000 simulations, are summarized in Table 6.3 and Figure
6.1.
3 Monte Carlo simulation works by generating a series of random numbers following the distribution of
probability of each risk variable. For each simulation which represents a combination of different state
of 5 variables, IERR is calculated and recorded. The results of 1,000 simulations are averaged.

6.15   The expected IERR, based on the weighted average of all simulated combinations
is 17.91 percent (with a standard deviation of 2.40 percent), 1 percent lower than the base
case value without consideration of project risks. The minimum and maximum IERR,
under the considered uncertainties, are respectively 11.03 and 26.24 percent. The
probability of a negative outcome (negative net present value) is zero. And finally, the
probability for the IERR to be below the considered discount rate is negligible.
6.16   All the above analyses clearly show that the project is robust under future
uncertainties and that the risk (margin of error) associated with it is acceptable. The
potential risks associated with power plant construction, cost overruns, and
implementation delays have been addressed through advanced procurement actions,
timely staffing and training of personnel of TEPGC, and the assistance provided by
highly experienced international engineering consultants.

B. THE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION COMPONENT
6.17  Operation records and load flow/short circuit analyses of the Beijing transmission
and distribution networks show that a number of 220 kV and 110 kV substations and
lines were overloaded and/or exceeding their rated fault levels in supplying the existing
demand. This causes a major safety and reliability concern in operating the entire North
China Power Grid. In January 1995, Beijing experienced a major blackout due to limited
transformation capacity in existing substations and limitation of the load transit capacity.
In the area where the new 220 kV substations are proposed, three out of five existing
110 kV substations were loaded at 92, 98 and 104 percent of their respective rated
capacity in 1995. The existing system is saturated and require major reinforcements to
adequately service the current load and supply any additional demand.
6.18  The proposed transmission upgrading plans were selected after thorough technical
analyses by NCEPDI and NCPGC. They represent the minimum requirements to avoid
further deterioration and ensure supply with acceptable standards of quality. A least-cost
analysis of this component was undertaken by BERI. Two major alternatives that are the
only feasible supply options were investigated:  (a) the first alternative (proposed
component) is based on introduction of two more injection points at the 220 kV level
closer to the city center (the Xibianmen and Xizhimen substations) to supply a number of
110 kV substations that are either existing or under construction, and (b) the second
alternative is based on continued expansion of the existing 110 kV transmission systems
by adding new 110 kV substations and lines. Considering the same incremental demand,
the cost stream for each alternative, over a project life of 30 years (economic investment
costs, operation and maintenance (O&M) costs as 2 percent of the capital investment
costs, and the estimated cost of losses based on the long-run marginal cost of supply), and
a 12 percent discount rate, the computed net present value of the costs of first alternative
is about $23 million, 17 percent, lower than that of the second alternative. This is a
conservative estimate because the cost of land and right-of-way, which is higher in the
second alternative, was not included.
6.19  Cost/benefit analysis of the component was carried out using the economic costs
and the incremental sales revenue as minimum benefits. The costs include: (a) capital
investments under the project, (b) investment costs at 110 kV and below to support the
demand growth, (c) the incremental O&M costs calculated at 2 percent of the capital
costs, (d) expenses for incremental power purchase (including 5 percent for power plant
use and 5 percent for transmission losses) valued at the system long-run marginal cost.
The power sales price considered for evaluating the incremental benefits is the current
average tariff and, therefore, does not exceed consumers' minimum willingness to pay.
The 15.55 percent IERR yielded by this methodology could be considered as a minimum
rate of return on the proposed transmission component.  The project remains
economically viable even in case of cost increases of 10 (IERR of 14.25 percent) and 20
(IERR of 13.10 percent) percent.

6.20 Upgrading of the distribution system in the heavily loaded, high-growth Xizhimen
area is a pilot project as part of a large-scale urban distribution rehabilitation program that
is being developed in association with the transmission development plan. At present,
about 60 percent of distribution lines are overloaded and 36 percent of installed
distribution transformers in Beijing are high-loss transformers. The annual losses were
about 220 GWh.  The technical aspect including loss reduction measures were
investigated by NCPGC and the economic justification was undertaken by BERI. The
major benefits are seen as the reduced losses and increased supply. The benefits of
reduced losses were calculated using the average consumer price of the Beijing
Municipality Grid at the retail level and the benefits of the incremental sales were
measured as the difference between the current average retail tariff and the average
transfer price at the high-voltage level. This conservative approach, which does not
include the benefit of improved quality of supply, yielded an IERR of 29 percent for the
pilot project. Sensitivity analysis showed that if the capital costs would increase by 30
percent, the IERR would still be 25 percent.
C. SUSTAINABILITY AND RISK OF THE PROJECT
6.21  Financial sustainability of the major project component is ensured by the PPA
developed by and signed between TEPGC and NCPGC prior to project negotiations and
suitable financial project covenants. The market for the power is guaranteed and NCPGC
will have no major problems in fulfilling its obligations under the PPA, even in the case
of moderate growth. Suitable performance monitoring indicators have been developed
that will allow impending major problems to be detected and corrective measures taken if
necessary.
6.22  All proposed technologies are currently in successful use in China. Cost overrun
risks have been addressed by advanced procurement action; bids for major components
have already been prepared before loan negotiations and issued prior to Board
presentation. The risk of delay in project construction due to project management
shortcomings is minimal because of the experience gained during the implementation of
the Haibowan and Dalate projects (two large coal-fired power plant in Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region), the timely staffing and training of personnel of the TEPGC and
NCPGC, and the assistance provided by experienced international engineering
consultants. The risk of nonperformance in the environmental and resettlement area has
been addressed by the establishment of appropriate monitoring organizations and
procedures.  More importantly, sensitivity analyses show that even in case of
implementation of more stringent environmental standards requiring future installation of
flue gas desulfurization (FGD), the project would remain economically viable.
6.23  Delay in implementing power sector reforms in an efficient and timely manner
represents a risk that can jeopardize the progress toward more openness and efficiency of
the sector and more fiscal and managerial autonomy of TEPGC and NCPGC. This risk is
minimized by the strong commitment of Chinese institutions to reform both at the central
and provincial level. This risk is also addressed through provision of required technical



- 54 -
assistance and adequate monitoring of implementation of the agreed upon reform plan
during the project cycle.
6.24 The economic and financial risks would be minimal. In view of advanced
preparatory works, risks associated with project construction, cost overruns, and
implementation delays are within reasonable limits and manageable with the agreed
supervision and involvement of competent consultants. Particular attention will be given
to the safety aspects of the project, and to capability and performance of major
contractors.
6.25  Risk analyses have been performed using a probabilistic approach to assess the
impact of the perceived risk factors that affect the return of the project. The risk analysis
was carried out with the Risk Master computer software, which uses Monte Carlo
simulation technique. The expected IERR, based on the weighted average of 1,000
simulated combinations is 17.91 percent (with a standard deviation of 2.40 percent),
1.00 percent lower than the base case value without consideration of project risks. The
minimum and maximum IERR, under the considered uncertainties, are respectively 11.03
and 26.24 percent. The probability of a negative outcome (negative net present value) is
zero. And finally, the probability for the IERR to be below the considered discount rate
is negligible.

ANNEX 3.1: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TEPGC
ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING AND FINANCIAL
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
A. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
1.    Tuoketuo Electric Power Generating Company (TEPGC) is a Limited Liability
Company, founded in May 1996 by the North China Power Group Company (NCPGC),
Inner Mongolia Electric Power Company (IMEPC), and Beijing International Electric
Power Development Investment Company (BIEPDIC). Their respective ownership
shares are NCPGC 51 percent, IMEPC 34 percent, and BIEPDIC 15 percent of the
shares.
2.    TEPGC is one of the beneficiaries of the proposed World Bank loan to finance the
first phase of the Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant (2x600 MW units). The output from the
station is to be purchased by NCPGC and fed into the Jing-Jin-Tang grid, intended
specifically to satisfy the increasing demand in Beijing and its environs.
3.    The formation of TEPGC as an independent nonutility generator is a significant
organizational development in the Chinese power sector.  It represents a major
undertaking to meet the operational challenges of power sector reforms initiated by the
Chinese Govermnent. One of the major objectives of these reforms is to establish a
modem  enterprise system  characterized by clear definition of property rights,
autonomous management, commercial orientation, financial independence, and
separation of government ownership  and regulatory  functions from  enterprise
management.  The reforms are mainly based on:  (a) new accounting regulations,
promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and in effect since July 1, 1994, and (b) the
improved enterprise policy and governance framework defined by the Company Law
enacted in July 1994.
4.    To achieve these objectives, the Chinese Government and the World Bank jointly
developed an implementation program of sector reforms that stresses full corporatization
and greater autonomy and accountability of power enterprises.' The reform strategy is
intended to improve the operational efficiency and increase the market orientation of the
power sector.
5.    Like most state-owned enterprises, TEPGC is likely to be faced with the
following problems: (a) government interference in management, administrative and
China Power Sector Reform: Toward Competition and Improved Performance, Report No. 12929-
CHA, Document of the World Bank, September 15, 1994.



-65 -                      ANNEX 3.1
operational decisions reflecting the former central planning orientation of the economy;
(b) lack of full accountability of managers stemming from an inadequate, highly
centralized decision-making and nonavailability of timely and accurate financial
information at different operational activity levels; and (c) lack of transparency of the
financial situation: financial statements may not provide full disclosure of TEPGC's
financial position.
6.    This technical assistance activity is financed through the Tuoketuo thermal power
project and is designed to address the above-mentioned organizational and financial
issues. It stresses the strengthening of internal organizational and management practices,
and the introduction of appropriate accounting, budgeting and financial management
systems. The technical assistance provides not only for consulting services but also
training of TEPGC's staff and managers in China and abroad to ensure successful
implementation of the study recommendations and developed systems. To achieve the
full benefits of organizational reform and improved financial reporting and monitoring
systems, it is proposed to carry out the project in three distinct but fully integrated phases:
Phase I: Preparation Phase
7.    Comprising a comprehensive review of the organizational structure, management
practices, and financial/accounting practices and reporting systems in TEPGC. Particular
attention would be paid to the division of responsibilities, flow of information and quality
of reporting, and budgeting and accounting systems and procedures.
Phase II: Development Phase
8.    Comprising the development of a suitable organizational structure, design of the
required accounting and financial and budgeting systems to meet the need of efficient
management and decentralized decision-making, and preparation of a detailed plan for
implementation.
Phase III: Implementation Phase
9.   Implementation of the organizational structure and financial systems approved by
TEPGC including computer, software and training needs.
B. SCOPE OF WORK
10.   The project will include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following tasks:
Phase I: Preparation Phase
11.   During the first phase, the consultants are required to carry out a detailed
assessment of the current organizational structure and financial management practices,
considering the experience of selected nonutility generation entities. The scope of this
review will include:
(a)   Internal organization, operating and administrative procedures with
particular attention to the responsibilities of the planned functional units



-66 -                      ANNEX 3.1
their relations. Aspects to be examined would be overlap in lines of
responsibility, excessive centralization of decision-making, and
organizational deficiencies;
(b)   Accounting procedures, documentation, reporting formats and the nature
of financial transactions between the various departments and units of
TEPGC;
(c)   Assessment of Cost Accounting, Financial Planning, Budgeting, and
Internal Audit systems and procedures;
(d)   Evaluation  of performance monitoring  systems: establishment of
performance targets and indicators, methods for communicating,
controlling and monitoring them.
Phase II: Development Phase
12.   During the second phase, the consultants will, jointly with TEPGC, develop an
organizational structure and related management, accounting, financial, control and
reporting systems that address TEPGC's specific requirements. Useful features of other
nonutility generating enterprise models in other countries and China will be incorporated.
The work in this phase is organized in three subactivities:
Organizational and Management Structure
13.   The consultants, jointly with TEPGC, will provide definitions of the functional
boundaries and responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the management of TEPGC
and the role of the President, Vice Presidents and their relationship with operational
departments. They will also provide redefinitions of the functional boundaries and
responsibilities of the different departments, work units and subsidiaries.  Special
attention should be given TEPGC's main functions. The recommended organization
should also prepare TEPGC for its role as a major player in a more competitive power
sector.
(a)   Definition of interorganizational relationships, communication  and
reporting channels between the different units.
(b)   Assistance in the preparation of an Operational Manual that describes the
organizational structure, functional boundaries, job descriptions,
communication and reporting channels, limits of authority, etc. Special
attention should be given to accounting and financial units.
(c)   Recommendation of optimal staffing and preparation of job description
and qualification requirements for all posts of reasonable importance in the
recommended organizational structure.



- 67 -                     ANNEX 3.1
(d)   Improvement of the planning and control of the operational support
functions such as maintenance, work planning/management, procurement,
quality control, transportation, personnel management, etc.
Accounting Systems and Practices
(a)   Definition of accounting units and activities clearly identifying cost and
profit centers, reporting requirements, formats for information flow and
frequency of information exchange. This task will develop a basic design
for the new financial and accounting information system. It is of crucial
importance that this basic design of the financial and accounting
management information system be totally consistent with the proposed
reorganization of business processes and procedures.
(b)   Development of a Standard Financial Accounting System and general
accounts classification detailing balance sheets, income statements, and
cash flow statements. This should include policies and system procedures,
recommended principles for accounting classification, and follow-up
methods. The system should develop and provide for the timely collection
of accounts receivable and settlement of accounts payable. It should also
contain standards for depreciation for fixed asset accounting.
(c)   Assistance in the preparation of an Accounting Manual setting forth a
coded chart of accounts, detailing and describing balance sheet accounts,
income accounts, functional and department accounts, cost/profit centers,
objective accounts, policies, standard procedure instructions, report
formats (including an inventory of reports describing their purpose and
method of preparation, assigning responsibilities for preparation,
timetable, frequency and distribution lists), use of capital and expense
budget programs (including guidelines distinguishing capital items and
items charges directly to expense).
(d)   Improvement of the Internal Control and Audit System through approval
and audit procedures, internal review systems-especially for purchasing,
inventory and stores, handling of cash, and payroll.
Budgeting and Performance-Based Management Information Systems
(a)   Defining the process of setting performance targets, and the systems for
controlling and monitoring them in practice. This would include policies
and procedures, related analytical techniques, and mechanical tools to
ensure project planning, formulation, justification, management and
control of budgets, including analysis of budget variances.
(b)   Procedures to integrate MIS with the cost accounting system so that it can
generate information for assigning responsibility, measure labor and input
productivity against standards, analyze and control cost variances (i.e.,



-68 -                      ANNEX 3.1
input and labor price and quantity, efficiency, overheads, and capacity
variances) from standards. This should facilitate the determination of the
level of profitability of TEPGC so that pricing decisions can be taken with
the full knowledge of costs.
(c)   Develop a Financial Planning system, including the introduction of
operational objectives and planned allocation of resources in the form of
Operating Expense Budgets and Capital Expenditure Budgets, and the
frequency for issuance. The budgeting system should be coordinated with
the financial accounts in order to reconcile budget variances with financial
figures.
(d)   Define the planning and control of operational support functions or central
service functions, such as, maintenance and work planning/preparation,
materials management, procurement, quality control, transportation,
personnel management, etc.
14.   The consultant will prepare a detailed scope of tasks and a clearly defined
implementation strategy. The implementation strategy will be divided into actions and
targets with a timetable and should identify the priorities of and sequence in
organizational change and systems development.
Phase III: Implementation
15.   During this phase, the consultant will assist TEPGC in implementing the
recommended changes in organizational structure, business practices, financial
management and reporting systems. The work will include:
(a)   assistance in implementing the organizational structure and organizing
work sessions/seminars to help managers and financial/accounting staff
fully understand the proposed system;
(b)   assistance in selecting and installing suitable hardware and software,
especially a new general ledger package and appropriate centralized/
distributed computer systems to be linked to desktop terminals.
(c)   identification of staffing and skills required to implement the new
financial/accounting systems and appropriate in-house, external training
programs, and assistance in preparation of training manuals.
C. APPROACH, REPORTING, OUTPUTS AND TIME SCHEDULE
16.   The international consultants will submit a proposal to cover all three phases of
the work. However, the proposal should delineate clearly the costs for each phase of the
work. The proposal will detail: (a) the proposed work plan, approach and organization
of the consultant's project team; (b) the tasks to be undertaken by each member of the
team, and (c) time allocated to each member in the field and head office to carry out his/
her assignment. Apart from providing a full complement of skills to undertake this task,



- 69 -                    ANNEX 3.1
the consultants will be required to demonstrate work experience on similar assignments
and good knowledge of the power utility industry.
17.   The task will be supervised and coordinated by a Steering Committee of senior
management and department directors to ensure that decisions are made promptly,
especially at the end of the first and second phases. The Committee will designate a
high-level project manager and a multidisciplinary working group to work with the
consultants and to ensure timely availability of data and full cooperation of staff at
various levels of the company. The international consultant will report problems and
difficulties in carrying his assignment to the project manager and Steering Committee,
and make recommendations to address them and ensure smooth and timely progress of
the assignment. The foreign consultants and the working group will work as a joint team
to carry out the project; however, the foreign consultant will remain responsible for the
quality of the work and for the recommendations presented to the Steering Committee at
the end of each phase of the process.

ANNEX 3.2: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR NCPGC
ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
A. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
1.    The North China Power Group Company (NCPGC) is one of the largest
companies in China. It has 47 wholly-owned subsidiary enterprises, 55 enterprises with a
controlling interest and 29 enterprises with a minority stake. NCPGC runs and operates
North China Power Grid. It supplies power to an area of 1.47 million square kilometers,
covering Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi and West Inner Monogolia.
2.    Like most state-owned enterprises, NCPGC is faced with the following problems:
(a) government interference in management, administrative and operational decisions,
reflecting the former central planning orientation of the economy; (b) lack of full
accountability of managers stemming from an inadequate, highly centralized decision-
making and nonavailability of timely and accurate financial information at different
operational activity levels; (c) lack of transparency of the financial situation: financial
statements that are now prepared based on the new accounting regulation effective July 1,
1993 still do not provide full disclosure of NCPGC's financial position as the
construction in progress is recorded separately; and (d) lack of focus on the core business
operations and involvement in many activities that include profitable activities such as
construction companies, design/engineering institutes, as well as welfare responsibilities
such as housing, school, hospitals, etc.
3.    NCPGC is undertaking major changes to meet the operational challenges of
power sector reforms initiated by the Chinese Government. One of the main objectives
of these reforms is to establish a modem enterprise system characterized by clear
definition of property rights, autonomous management, commercial orientation, financial
independence, and separation of government ownership and regulatory functions from
enterprise management. To achieve these objectives, the Chinese Government and the
World Bank jointly developed an implementation program of sector reforms that stresses
full corporatization and greater autonomy and accountability of power enterprises. The
reform strategy is intended to improve the operational efficiency and increase the market
orientation of the power sector.
4.    NCPGC is expected to receive a loan from the World Bank to finance the
Tuoketuo Thermal Power Project. The project includes consultancy services to assist
NCPGC in upgrading its accounting and financial management practices and systems and
developing modern, computerized accounting and financial information systems, which
will enable managers to obtain timely information on the costs of all aspects of the
company's activities. The new systems would facilitate better budgetary control and

ANNEX 4.1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION: TUOKETUO
THERMAL POWER PLANT COMPONENT
General
1.    The owner of the project is Tuoketuo Electric Power Generating Company
(TEPGC). The domestic designer is the North China Electric Power Design Institute
(NCEPDI). Two coal-fired turbo-generating units of 600 MW each will be installed in
the plant to be financed under a proposed World Bank loan. The ultimate capacity of the
plant will be 3,600 MW (6 x 600 MW). The target date of the completion of the first
phase (2x600 MW) is September 2002. After completion of the project, the plant will
supply electric power to the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area in North China.  The
scheduled dates of commercial operation of the two units are as follows:
Unit 1 - October 2001
Unit 2 - September 2002
2.    The proposed Tuoketuo thermal power plant is located in a plain in Tuoketuo
County, about 70 km south of Huhhot City, the capital of Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region, about 50 km northeast of Zhungeer Coal Mine and 7 km north of the Yellow
River. It has favorable geological conditions and easy access by railway and highway.
The power plant will be leveled above the once-for- 100-year flood line.
Coal
3.    Basic design parameters for the boilers and turbine generators are based on standard
specifications of 600 MW coal-fired subcritical units of proven technology. The power
plant will use up to 4.0 million tons per year and will be designed to bum a blend of
screened unwashed coal from the Zhungeer coal mines. The coal will be bituminous with
a calorific value of 4,300+500 kcal/kg, ash content of 264 percent and sulfur content of
0.47 percent. The Zhungeer coal will be transported to the power station by trains, using
electric locomotives. The rolling stock will be owned by the power station, but the lines
are the property of the mine except for a spur of about 45 km to be built and owned by the
station.
Cooling and Make-upWater System
4.    The source of cooling and make-up water required by the power plant (1.2 m3/sec
in summer peak for the 2x600 MW units) will be supplied from the Yellow River. A
closed circulating water system will be adopted. Each unit will be equipped with one
cooling tower and three circulating water pumps.



- 80 -                        ANNEX 4.1
500 kV Transmission Lines and Associated Substations
5.    To transmit the electricity generated by the project to the JTTPG, three 500 kV
transmission lines and associated sub- and switching stations will be constructed under a
separate project that does not involve World Bank funding. One of these lines will run
from the Tuoketuo plant to the Anding substation in the suburbs of Beijing, a distance of
520 km. This line will pass through Yingxian, where a series capacitor compensation
station will be located. Another line, about 35 km in length, will connect the Tuoketuo
plant to the Yongshengyu switching station in Inner Mongolia. The third line (145 km)
will interconnect the Shunyi and Qianxi substations. The associated sub- and switching
stations include (a) the series capacitor compensation station in Yingxian; (b) the new
Yongshengyu switching station with three bays; (c) extension of the Anding substation
by one bay and installation of an additional 750 MVA transformer; and (d) the new
Qianxi substation in Beijing in which one 500 kV bay will be constructed and one
750 MVA transformer installed. The Shunyi-Qianxi line will also require an additional
bay in the Shunyi substation. Implementation of the transmission project will be
coordinated with the construction of the Tuoketuo generating station to ensure
completion of the new transmission infrastructure before trial operation of the generating
station begins. The total cost of the transmission lines and associated substations is
estimated to be Y 3,082 million (1995 prices), including compensation for land and
facilities acquisition. The environmental impact of these transmission lines is addressed
in Section 4.7 of the Tuoketuo environmental assessment report (EAR).
Turbines and Generators
6.    The two turbines will have a nominal rated output of 600 MW with subcritical'
steam pressure of 16.7 MPa at high-pressure turbine inlet and superheat and reheat
temperature of 538C each unit will be equipped with one high-pressure turbine bypass
system and one low-pressure turbine bypass system.
7.    The turbine generators will have a nominal capacity of 600 MW  each at 22 kV.
The cooling mode is a water-hydrogen-hydrogen type. A static excitation system will be
adopted.
For 600 MW class thermal power plants, there are two alternative configurations, one with subcritical
and the other with supercritical steam conditions. For the Tuoketuo project, the units will be designed
to have standard subcritical steam conditions because of the following reasons:
 The Tuoketuo power plant is a mine-mouth power plant. The subcritical plant is economically
justified because of relatively low fuel cost.
* The Tuoketuo power plant will be the first 600 MW class plant in the Inner Mongolia region.
(The largest existing plant in Inner Mongolia is the 330 MW Dalate power plant.) It is
premature to build a 600 MW supercritical unit in the Inner Mongolia Region.



- 81-                     ANNEX 4.1
Steam Generators
8.    The steam generators will be of the subcritical,' single reheat, dry bottom ash,
balanced draft, drum type, each rated to MCR of 2,020 tons/hour, steam pressure of
18.18 MPa and steam temperature of 5410C at superheater and reheater outlets. Each
steam generator will be equipped with six medium-speed mills. When burning "design
coal," five mills will be operated with one stand-by. Two boilers will share a 240 m
chimney.  For air pollution mitigation, the design includes four-field electrostatic
precipitator with 99.76 percent efficiency, low NOx burners and other low NOx
technology. Provision has been made for space to install gas desulfurization equipment,
if required in the future by more stringent environmental standards.
Coal Handling System
9.    Coal will be transported by railway from the Zhungeer coal mines to the power
plant with self-discharge bottom-dump cars and slope-type coal wagons. The project
includes a coal storage yard with a capacity of about 128,400 tons, which is equivalent to
10 days' coal consumption of the two 600 MW units.
Ash Handling System
10.   The two first 600 MW units, built under the proposed project, will produce about
1.13 million tons of fly ash and 0.22 million tons of slag each year. The ash yard will be
located 2 km south of the plant and will have the capacity corresponding to ash and slag
disposal for 17 years. To facilitate the utilization of fly ash, the power plant will be
provided with coarse ash and fine ash storages. TEPGC plans to utilize about 30 percent
of the fly ash. The fly ash from the electrostatic precipitators and the bottom of
economizers of the two units will be conveyed pneumatically to a dry ash silo where the
dry ash will be moisturized to ease its handling and piling in the ash yard. Slag will be
crushed and sluiced hydraulically in intermittent cycles into the front basin of the ash and
slag pumphouse. The ash and slag will be transferred hydraulically by the ash/slag
pumps to the ash yard. A recirculation water system will be adopted to reduce water
consumption. The cooling tower blowdown water of 600 tons/hour is supplied to the
system to compensate the evaporation from the ash yard of 600 tons/hour.
Instrumentation and Control System
11.   A microprocessor-based distributed control system including data acquisition
system (DAS), supervisory control system (SCS), control coordination system (CCS),
furnace fire fighting system (FSSS), etc. will be provided. Display of plant-specific
equipment status and operating parameters on CRTs installed in the central control room
will provide real-time interface between operators and plant systems.  On-line
performance monitoring system will be provided to increase plant performance, reduce
coal consumption and gradually introduce innovative advanced maintenance techniques.

ANNEX 4.2: PROJECT DESCRIPTION: BEIJING
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION (T&D) COMPONENT
General
1.    Beijing T&D component is one of the two major components of the Tuoketuo
Thermal Power Project. The objective of the component is to reduce the constraints to
efficient transmission and distribution of power within the city of Beijing, particularly in
the densely populated, high load-growth areas around the city center.
2.   Investment in the transmission and distribution networks in Beijing over the last
decade have not kept pace with the increase in consumer demand. The Beijing Municipal
Electric Power Grid is therefore experiencing major operational problems: reduced
reliability of supply, overload of a number of major substations and lines, and high losses
in the system, especially in the city center. To ensure adequate supplies, it is necessary to
introduce more injection points at higher transmission voltages closer to the city center
and to upgrade the heavily loaded distribution system. These measures will improve
supply reliability, reduce losses and improve the quality of consumer service. The
component will achieve these objectives by providing new substations, installing reactive
compensation, increasing transformer capacities in substations and on distribution lines,
installing more efficient distribution transformers and increasing the sizes of conductors
on many distribution lines. These investments are needed to ensure that the power which
is to be transmitted from the Tuoketuo power station to Beijing can be efficiently relayed
to end-users while conforming to accepted standards of quality.
3.    The proposed component consists of the following items:
220 kV Indoor Substations
4.    Two new indoor substations will be constructed at Xibianmen and Xizhimen, two
areas in which the power demand is increasing rapidly. Xibianmen substation is to be
equipped with two 250 MVA, 220/110/10 kV transformers, two 30 MVAR capacitor
banks and gas-insulated switchgear (GIS). Xizhimen substation is proposed to have the
same configuration as Xibianmen but with two 200 MVA, 220/110/10 kV transformers.
Each substation will supply a number of 110/10 kV substations, which are not included in
the component but are either already existing or under construction. In addition, a
number of 10 kV feeders will emanate directly from the proposed substations. The
following element are also associated with the two new substations:
* 220 kV single-core XLPE cable (87.2 km)
*  110 kV single-core XLPE cable (1.1 km)



- 83 -                    ANNEX 4.2
* 10 kV switchgear (2 sets, 77 cubicles and 87 cubicles)
* Automatic transformer fire-extinguishing systems (2 sets)
* High-voltage protection equipment and substation supervisory and control
systems
5.    One 250 MVA, 220/110/10 kV transformer is to be installed in the Wangfujing
substation. This is an underground substation currently being constructed with two
250 MVA transformers. An additional transformer is required to efficiently satisfy the
rapidly increasing consumer demand. The proposed component therefore includes the
third transformer as well as the associated supply cables. In connection with and to
complement this project, NCPGC will undertake the following program, approved
separately and financed locally.
110/10 kV Transformers
6.    Four 50 MVA, 110/10 kV transformers will be installed to replace the overloaded,
inefficient transformers now installed in the Beicheng and Huichengmen substations.
The two substations were loaded at 104 percent and 98 percent of their respective rated
capacity in 1995. The existing transformers do not comply with statutory environmental
regulations concerning permissible noise levels, and the power utility must pay
appreciable amounts annually in penalties for not complying with the regulations.
Distribution Rehabilitation
7.    A pilot area of distribution system rehabilitation has been selected at Xizhimen
2
district located in the northwest of the city and covers an area of 8.3 km . The area is
densely populated and the power demand has been increasing rapidly. By the end of
1995, the area had a population of 220,000 and a peak demand of 40 MW. In order to
reduce the distribution losses and to improve the supply efficiency, the proposed
investments include:
  replacing the existing 41 km of 10 kV bare-conductor overhead line by three-
phase insulated conductor with larger cross-sections.
*  reconductoring of 32 km low-voltage lines
*  installation of five compact transformer stations with low-loss transformers
(6,300 kVA)
*  installation of 55 low-loss distribution transformers (16,025 kVA)
*  installation of 128 sets of capacitors
*  installation of 45 sets of distribution automation equipment
*  reconductoring of low-voltage lines to 8,905 residential consumers.
8.    The beneficiary of the component will be the North China Power Group Company
(NCPGC), which has responsibility for electricity transmission and distribution in
Beijing, through the Beijing Power Supply Company (BPSC). BPSC is an administrative
unit of NCPGC and not a legal entity in itself. NCPGC is also responsible for execution
of the component including construction, commissioning and operation. Beijing Power

ANNEX 4.6: CONSULTANCY SERVICES FOR
ESTABLISHING AND OPERATIONALIZING THE
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT UNIT (EMU)-TERMS
OF REFERENCE
Introduction
1.    The Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia contains vast coal reserves whose
development will be dramatically expanded in the near future. Consistent with this
increase in coal production will be the substantial development of power generation
facilities in this region on a scale heretofore never experienced. Tuoketuo Electric Power
Generation limited liability Company (TEPGC) recognized the need and priority for
addressing environmental and social issues in planning and implementing this
development.  Consequently, it is their intention to establish an environmental
management unit (EMU) within their corporate structure to insure proper attention is
given to these matters in terms of both immediate management, and their strategic
planning. TORs for this EMU are attached.
2.    In addition to TEPGC's efforts to incorporate the environmental and social
dimension to their development activities, local and regional environmental authorities
also play key roles, particularly with regard to air and water quality management. Air
quality was identified as a priority issue. These authorities wish technical assistance to
provide them with the necessary tools to prepare an quality management plan.
Objectives
3.    The objectives of this work effort are as follows:
* Design a detailed work program for the EMU
* Support initial startup and operation of the EMU
* Design a detailed training program in air quality management
4.    A description of the Consultant' work program is presented below.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE EMU WORK PROGRAM
5.    The Consultant will prepare a Work Program for the EMU for the next three
years. Prior to the preparation of this program, the Consultant will review: (a) the
Chinese regulatory framework (state, provincial and local) for pollution control and social
assessment, and (b) regional power sector development plans. The Consultant will then
Consultant is to be considered local unless otherwise noted.



- 106 -                      ANNEX 4.6
hold discussions with appropriate government officials, and based on these discussions
identify key environmental and social issues associated with the development of power
generation capacity in the region.
6.    This Task will be the basis on which to identify the priority objectives and
activities of the EMU Work Program. Priority objectives should be developed for
implementation at both corporate and power station or field installation. For each set of
objectives, the Consultant should define specific performance criteria for each activity at
corporate and field levels.
7.    A staffing plan should be prepared by the Consultant in collaboration with staff of
TEPGC. This plan should incorporate both requirements for hiring new permanent staff,
reassignment of current staff, and utilizing consultants (local or foreign) for some of the
activities.
8.    The foreign Consultant will than prepare a training program consistent with the
staffing plan. This program will include identification of: necessary skills needed by the
EMU staff, appropriate trainers, and/or training programs (both domestic and
international). Visits to China by international experts, overseas travel by company
personnel for specific training programs are some of the possible options. Training
programs should include, but not be limited to the following subject areas: environment
and natural resources management, pollution control (air, water, solids), resettlement,
rehabilitation and community development, environmental monitoring, data collection
and processing, EIA preparation, environmental and safety audits, interpretation and
implementation of environmental regulations, and computer system design for
environmental management.
9.    The training program will include a curriculum for the various subjects, and a
estimate of classroom, and training aids needed. It should also include a mobilization
plan for the trainers, equipment, and facilities, to be utilized from within the company,
within China, or imported internationally.
10.   The foreign Consultant should also prepare a detailed financial plan for the
training program. The plan should identify costs (local/foreign) of international trainers,
overseas training by TEPGC staff, equipment and training aids (books, literature, tapes,
videos, etc.).
POLICY GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS
11.   The consultant will prepare draft policy guidelines and regulations consistent with
the objectives as specified in the TORs of the EMU (attached). In particular:
* Guidelines and interpretation of China's laws and regulations that will enable
the company to comply in a timely and cost-effective manner. Corporate
targets for atmospheric emissions of dust, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides,
wastewater effluent discharges, solid wastes (particularly ash, and spent



- 107 -                    ANNEX 4.6
sorbents from sulfur dioxide abatement systems), and worker health and
safety.
Targets will be established on the basis of anticipated future framework of
environmental regulation in China, international treaties/agreements, and
corporate development plans. The targets will depend on options in fuel
quality, abatement technology, and an assessment of potential for energy
conservation (demand side).
*  Guidelines for EIA preparation, identifying key issues, and requirements of
China, and multilateral institutions (World Bank, Asian Development Bank,
etc.).
*  Guidelines for resettlement and rehabilitation of peoples affected by corporate
projects.
*  Establish guidelines for the utilization, preservation and management of
natural resources (air, water, land, forests, cultural, etc.).
*  Guidelines for worker and workplace health and safety.
Technical/Operational and Management Guidelines
12.   The Consultant will prepare a set of operational standards, performance criteria,
good practice, and procedures for the following:
*  Worker Health: the Consultant will review standards of China, and various
international organizations, and use these as a basis of his recommendations.
-  Worker Safety: the Consultant will review plant safety rating systems and,
based upon these systems, formulate one or more systems for use in various
field installations.
*  Emergency Response:   The Consultant will prepare guidelines for
formulating emergency response plans.
*  Environmental Monitoring  and  Data Management System:   The
Consultant will prepare a monitoring guideline package for power plants and
transmission systems, including methods, equipment selection criteria, data
processing and reporting. The package should also include atmospheric
dispersion models (guidelines for selection), and monitoring of ecological
impacts at power stations and along transmission lines, community and
occupational health. The package should also include criteria for the selection
of monitoring contractors, and standard TOR.
*  Auditing: The Consultant will prepare detailed TOR for power plant and
transmission line environmental audits. Auditing procedures should include
worker health and safety aspects as well as environment.



-108 -                     ANNEX 4.6
DESIGN OF A CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL LABORATORY
13.   The Consultant will prepare a detailed design of an environmental laboratory.
The design should include personnel requirements (number of staff and skills) sampling
and analysis equipment requirements (stationary and mobile), and complete itemization
of expendables (glassware, chemicals, etc.) to keep the laboratory operating for three
years.
DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
14.   The foreign Consultant will review the environmental monitoring program for the
Tuoketuo thermal power station. Based upon this review, and the various environmental
monitoring requirements of China, IMEPB, HEPB and TEPB, the foreign Consultant will
establish the quantity and quality (electronically or manually recorded, etc.) of
environmental data to be received.
15.   Based upon this information, the foreign Consultant will design a computer-based
data collection and analysis system, which will include both hardware and software
requirements and design specifications. The design is to include system costs.
16.   After agreement is reached with EMU management on the environmental data
management system design, the foreign Consultant will assist the EMU in securing and
installing the equipment, and operationalizing the system.
17.   The system should be capable of generating environmental data reports to meet
the needs of TEPGC management, China's environmental authorities (NEPA), and both
the provincial and local environmental protection bureaus (IMEPB, TEPB). Furthermore,
the system design should be "expandable," in the sense that it can be readily adapted to
the additional environmental data that will be generated when the second, and third
phases of Tuoketuo are on line.
SUPPORT AND SERVICE: DESIGN OF AN AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT TRAINING
PROGRAM
18.   Local environmental officials are responsible for preparation of an air quality
management plan for the Tuoketuo area. Such a plan has not yet been prepared, nor do
the officials involved have the technical experience needed to produce this plan.
However, these officials wish to receive the necessary training in air quality management
to be able to accomplish this task.
19.   The foreign Consultant will design a technical training program for officials of the
local environmental protection bureaus, in the area of air quality management planning.
The training is to be designed so that trainees will subsequently be able to prepare an air
quality management plan for the Tuoketuo region.
20.   The number of staff to be trained, venue, and duration of training is presented
below:

21.   Domestic training could be offered by an either Chinese or international experts
coming to Huhhot, or by EPB staff traveling to a local institution (NEPA, university,
research institute, etc.) identified by the foreign Consultant as knowledgeable and
qualified to offer this training.
IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE
22.   The Consultant will provide a team of professionals, the number will depend upon
their background, and experience in handling one or more of the assignments described
above. The team will be expected to assist in both establishing and operationalizing the
EMU. Written documentation concerning background and experience (Curriculum
Vitae) of the propose team members are to be submitted to both TEPGC and the World
Bank for review and approval prior to their final selection.
23.   Consultant involvement should be for about one year, although individual team
members may complete their specific assignments in less time, and be replaced by
another team member with skills associated with another aspect of the assignment. It is
expected that the Team Leader, and at least one associate will be present, full-time, for
the entire duration of the assignment.  The team will assume responsibility for
implementation after completion of the study report and its approval by the company and
the World Bank.

-111-                       ANNEX 4.7
ANNEX 4.7: ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
A. SUMMARY OF KEY PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
Air Pollution
1.    Table 1 presents air pollution characteristics for the proposed project (1200 MW),
and the total power program planned for the site (3600 MW). As can be seen, emission
standards for dust, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides are all in compliance with Chinese
standards and World Bank guidelines. Air quality data are also presented, and for both
sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, it is predicted that the project (1200 MW) and overall
program (3600 MW) will not result in a violation of World Bank guidelines and most
Chinese standards.) Existing background dust levels exceed both Chinese standards, and
World Bank guidelines. This is not unusual for China in general, and in particular for
this area which is close to desert conditions. With project implementation, and ultimately
with the overall program, these dust levels have been estimated to be slightly elevated.
However, the estimated increases are so small as to be virtually undetectable if they were
real, and well within the error bounds of the model.
2.    Carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to be 0.0067 and 0.020 billion tons/year
for the 1,200 MW and 3,600 MW situations, respectively. This represents 0.031 and
0.093 percent of the annual industrial global burden.
3.    Finally, estimates of the Tuoketuo power program (3,600 MW) contribution to the
acid rain/acid deposition issues in China were estimated using the RAINS-ASIA model
developed in ASTEN. Results of these calculations indicated that the levels of acid
deposition are relatively low.
The "once maximum" for sulfur dioxide is estimated to exceed the Chinese standard by 3 percent when
the program is fully implemented (3,600 MW). For the proposed project (1,200 MW), no exceedance
occurs. Even in the case of the full 3,600 MW program, the small exceedance is well within the errors
of air quality modeling and monitoring.

Water Pollution
4.       The power station will recycle wastewaters to the greatest extent possible.  Any
excess wastewater will be discharged after appropriate treatment to meet Chinese
standards and World Bank guidelines. Treatment, when needed, will be either physical
and/or biological. Most of the cooling tower blowdown will be reused. A breakdown of
water reuse characteristics is presented below:

All effluent discharges will be to the Yellow River via the Gengqinggou canal. This
canal traverses some small farms, so much of this water will, in fact, be removed by
farmers for irrigation.
5.     Table 2 details liquid effluent streams, their pollution characteristics, and the
control measures to be taken. Additionally, Chinese effluent standards are provided. As
can be seen in the table, all effluents are in compliance with applicable standards.

6.     Impacts to water quality of the Yellow River from the effluent discharge were
estimated. From Table 3 presented below, it is seen that beyond the mixing zone in the
most critical situations (low flow, and average flow) water quality meets Chinese water
quality standards. Furthermore, the shape of the mixing zone does not traverse the entire
river width, so that mobile species can simply avoid the zone by swimming away.
Therefore, it is unlikely that the effluent will present any negative impact on aquatic
ecology of the Yellow River.

Coal Transport and Handling
7.    Fuel to the Tuoketuo power station will be low-sulfur bituminous coal obtained
from the Zhungeer Coal Mine. The mine is located approximately 44 km from the power
station. At the mine location a new, large coal-washing plant has been constructed, but is
not yet operational. The power station fuel supply will be an unwashed, screened product
of this washing plant, containing 0.47 percent sulfur and 30.0 percent ash. The coal
(14,520 tons/day) will be shipped along the Zhungeer-Fengzhen dedicated rail line, which
is under Zhungeer Coal Industry Corporation control.
8.    At the coal storage yard, sprinkling facilities using a portion of the cooling tower
blowdown will be installed for dust suppression. Spraying will be done on a regular
basis. A rotary sprinkler system will be provided for dust suppression at loading and
unloading sections of the stacker reclaimer, belt conveyor, and feeder. A cyclone
separator will be used at each transfer station, coal bunker bay and in the crusher room.
Baghouses will be provided at coal storage silos. All excess runoff water shall be
collected, treated and recycled.
Ash Management
9.    Ash will be slurried with cooling water blowdown and pumped to the Gaobashi
ash yard. The ash yard is about 2 km south of the power station has sparse vegetation and
poor soil stability. Currently two households (four people) live at the site and they will
be resettled. For Phase 1 (1,200 MW), the site occupies 3.36 km2, will be constructed to
a height of 15 meters and its life is estimated at 17.3 years. When all three phases are
2
complete (3,600 MW), the site will be expanded to 6.36 km , will be filled to a height of
30 meters, and have an expected life of 24 years.
10.   Most of the site has a natural layer of clay to protect groundwater. However, there
are sufficient areas at the site that do not have this clay layer. Modeling studies indicated
that if the site were to be used without an additional impermeable liner, the groundwater
would become polluted. There are four potable wells within 500-1,000 m of the site, so
protection of this groundwater is required. Based upon these factors, a sufficient layer of
clay will be added at those points at the disposal area where there is no naturally
occurring clay. Then, a geotextile liner, 3-4 mm thick, will be used over the entire ash
disposal site to protect groundwater.  Potable wells will be monitored regularly
throughout the project life, and additional monitoring wells will be drilled at the site
periphery to further ensure against contamination.
11.   To prevent dusting, the area will be covered with water. A sprinkling system
utilizing recirculated cooling tower blowdown is included as a protective measure, should
any localized "dry spots" occur at the ash yard. Water drains underneath the ash yard will
collect water and recycle it with the ash slurry system. The ash yard will be partitioned
into cells, each representing about 10 percent of the total surface area. Cells will be used
one at a time. Each cell will be filled and covered before the next one is used. This will



-115 -                      ANNEX 4.7
further minimize dust formation and ensure adequate water is available to wet the ash
suffice in the driest periods of the year.
12.   A 100 meter band of forest will be planted around the yard, to act as a windbreak
and remove the site from view. When the ash yard is filled, it will be covered with soil
and revegetated in a manner consistent with principles of dryland vegetation.
Transmission Line and Distribution System
13.   The 500 kV line will deliver power to Beijing a distance of approximately
507 km. The line will travel over rugged mountainous terrain as well as farmland, and
cross eight rivers (none navigable), through the Provinces of Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and
Hebei. There will be no resettlement involved, and no historic or protected areas (local or
State) are traversed. The closest site along the route is the Heng Mountain scenic spot,
32 km from the power line.
14.   There are no migratory bird routes crossing the transmission lines, so no
protective measures will be used on the transmission towers to prevent bird electrocution.
It is estimated that about 40 km2 of land will be occupied by the transmission towers.
Tower design will be in accordance with all Chinese standards with respect to noise and
electric field.
15.   Within the Xizhimen region of Beijing, a distribution component will replace
some lines in the distribution network as well as some existing transformers with five
compact transformer stations.  No impacts are expected from  these replacement/
rehabilitation activities. No PCBs will be used in the transformers or capacitors, and this
will be so specified in the bid documents. Transformers that are to be replaced do not
contain PCBs and written assurances have been provided by responsible authorities
confirming this fact.
Railway
16.   Coal will be transported along a dedicated rail line from coal-washing plant to
power station. The railroad will be located along the eastern bank of the Yellow River.
The route passes through both rugged mountainous terrain and flat farming areas. Special
attention will be paid to construction techniques, particularly in the mountainous region,
to avoid modifications to runoff patterns. The rail will be designed to minimize noise
when trains are in use. The track will occupy approximately 260.2 ha but no resettlement
will be required.
17.   There are four stations along the route. Two of these stations, Wang Yu Ying and
Lan Jia Yao, will generate a total of 37 m3/day of wastewater, which will be skimmed for
removal of oil (0.647 kg/day). Treated wastewater will be used for irrigation, and
collected oil will be given to employees for use as cooking oil.



-116-                        ANNEX 4.7
Water Supply
18.   The water source for the power plant will be the Yellow River. For Phase I,
approximately 1.0 m3/sec will be required. There are three basic components to the water
supply system: intake structure, treatment (clarification/settling pond), and delivery
pipeline to the power station. Location of the intake structure is approximately 12 km
southwest of the plant site. Of the total water withdrawn, the portion of water to be used
for cooling tower makeup will be chlorinated.
19.   The river bank will be stabilized to protect the intake structure. This will have the
added benefit of stabilizing the river course, preventing erosion, and protecting both the
people and property in the vicinity. Impacts on navigation at the location of the intake
structure were estimated to be negligible.
20.   The chief potential impact will be dust generated at the area to be established for
disposition of silt which will be removed from the settling pond. A 71.3 ha site is to be
established for this purpose. It will be filled to a height of 3.4 meters. In order to
minimize dust generation, silt will be conditioned to make it easy to vegetate and then the
area will be reclaimed with appropriate plants. A windbreak will also be planted on the
periphery to lower wind velocity, and thereby further reduce dust generation potential.
Noise
21.   The power station is to be located in a sparsely populated area. There are no
major communities, or human activities within the vicinity proposed for the plant.
Nonetheless, the plant will be designed so that all equipment will meet the appropriate
standards of maximum allowable noise generation (GB 12348-90: Noise Standard at
Boundaries of Industries and Enterprises). These requirements will be specified in the
equipment bid documents.
22.   An analysis of noise potential indicated the following sources were most
significant: turbine generator set, coal mill, cooling tower, and transformer section. The
analysis further indicated that to ensure noise standards will be met in the community,
silencers are to be used for the boiler safety valves, and boiler exhaust. The plant
enclosure will be sound-proofed to contain noise generated by the turbine, coal grinding
units, etc.
23.   Chinese noise standards are more stringent than those of the World Bank. Thus,
compliance with Chinese standards offers implicit compliance with World Bank
Environmental Guidelines.
Aquatic/Terrestrial Ecology
24.   The project will be located in a relatively uninhabited area that is classified as dry
semi-arid grassland. Forest growth in the area is poor and it is considered to be of low
botanical diversity and difficult to afforest. The quantity of aquatic species in the Yellow



-117 -                      ANNEX 4.7
River are considered to be low production. There are no rare or endangered species, and
few animal species inhabiting the site.
25.   During construction, there will be some disruption (temporary and permanent) to
both wildlife habitat and vegetative cover. However, appropriate construction techniques
should minimize any impacts. A large soil conservation/desertification control program
is included in the project, which will more than compensate for any loss of vegetative
cover.
26.   Air quality impacts to agriculture and vegetation from sulfur dioxide (SO2) and
fluoride (F-) were estimated to be negligible. Ash pond runoff waters will be collected
and managed, and all wastewaters will be treated to standards prior to discharge.
Therefore no impacts on the aquatic ecology are anticipated.
Occupational Health and Safety
27.   Appropriate considerations will be incorporated into the design and operation of
the plant and related facilities to insure worker health and safety. Special considerations
were incorporated into the design to assure safe conditions in the management of
hazardous materials (fuel oil, chlorine, hydrogen, caustic, etc.). International standards of
worker safety will be included in all bid documents of project equipment. Boilers, and
other potentially dangerous equipment will be designed to meet ASME standards of
safety and will be so specified in the bid documents. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
are illegal in China; their use is prohibited in the project. Prohibition of asbestos will be
specified in the bid documents.
Human Environment
28.   There are no important tourism resources in the Tuoketuo area. No sites of
archaeological, historic, religious, architectural or aesthetic value recognized by the State
or the autonomous region are located at the project area. The nearest cultural landmarks
are in the capital city of Hohhot.
29.   From June 20 to June 22, 1994, public meetings were held at Xikoukou village of
Yanshanying county. General conclusions of the participants were:
*  Tuoketuo project is beneficial to both country and local people
*  The project will not cause environmental pollution, but rather improve the
local standard of living
*  Relocation arrangements were satisfactory
*  The project will improve the local economy

ANNEX 4.8: DESERTIFICATION CONTROL COMPONENT
Introduction
1.    The Tuoketuo thermal power plant (2x600 MW) is located in a region where soil
erosion and land desertification causes an increasing concern. As part of the project, a
desertification control component has been designed and will be implemented in order to
mitigate the adverse environmental impacts of the power plant and to contribute to
improving the conditions and standards of living of the population in the project area
(about 46,000 people).
Scope of the Component
2.    The component consists of two parts:
(a)   Part A: intensive afforestation of the areas immediately surrounding the
power plant, ash disposal yard, cooling water intake, water supply and
discharge pipelines, and access roads.
(b)   Part B: selective afforestation of the region around the Tuoketuo power
plant, covering a total surface area of 400 km2 (20 km x 20 km)
concerming two counties and one minority banner (equivalent to county).
3.    The total afforested area upon completion of this component will be 3,137 ha
(4,535,000 trees), in which Part A involves 120 ha (228,000 trees). An illustration map
(IBRD 28283) is attached. The major activities of the component comprise:
(a)   afforestation by manual planting and aerial seeding,
(b)   introduction of high-wind and drought-resistant tree species to the existing
sparse and low-yield forestry,
(c)   construction of a nursery to provide seedlings,
(d)   dissemination of new technologies of afforestation to local people, and
(e)   landscaping around the power plant.
4.    The equipment and facilities in association with this component include motor-
pumped wells and canals for irrigation, planting equipment, vehicles, access roads, tool
warehouse, power supply and communication facilities.

Cost Estimate and Financing Plan
5.    The investment cost of the component is estimated at Y 9.05 million (about $1.09
million), of which the Part A related cost is Y 2.49 million. Details are shown in Table 1.
TABLE 1: COST ESTIMATE

Total Component Cost                  9,051.4
6.    It should be noted that the component cost is underestimated. Part of volunteer
work by local people for forestry transformation is not included in the cost. The cost
disbursement schedule is given below:
1997    1998   1999   2000    2001
Y'000           1,518.4  1,830.1  2,333.0  2,323.8  1,046.1
7.    The component will be financed by TEPGC, central government and local
government. TEPGC will meet the entire cost of Part A and contribute 25 percent of the
cost of Part B, which together will amount to Y 4.18 million. The balance will be
covered by government funds, of which 30 percent by the Ministry of Forestry and 70
percent by Hohhot municipality and Tuoketuo county.
Implementation Aspect
8.    A unit in charge of implementation of this component will be set up within the
organization of TEPGC. The unit will have 11 permanent employees. Temporary
workers will be contracted as required. The unit will work closely with the local
government and people. Since the purpose and activities of the component comply with
that of three state-sponsored programs, known as "Three-North Shelter Forest Program,"
"Nationwide Afforestation Program" and "Nationwide Sand Prevention and Control
Program," it is expected that strong supports will be given by the govermnent at different
levels in implementing the component.



-126 -                       ANNEX 4.8
9.    The feasibility study of this component was carried out by the Inner Mongolia
Forestry Science Academy, which is experienced in desertification control. The selected
species are best suited to local environment conditions, and high pollution resistant. They
also yield high economic value. Locally available species will be widely used. The
designed multifunction forests are for timber, road shelter, farm field shelter, sand control
shelter, soil conservation and cash-tree. The year-to-year afforestation plan is given
below:

in which Part A (ha)  11.97    23.94     35.90     35.90      11.97
Economic Cost/Benefit Analysis
10.   All the costs and benefits are expressed in economic terms using shadow pricing.
The actual market rate is used as the shadow price for labor costs. Taxes are excluded.
The planning period is 20 years (1997-2016).
11.   The costs include investment costs and operating costs. The benefits of the
component stem from direct incomes, environmental and social benefits.
(a)    Direct incomes are from  selling forestry products, such as timber,
seedling, and fruits, and are measured by the market values.
(b)   Environmental benefit.  The implementation of the component can
protect the facilities of the power plant as well as 21 km railway and road
from soil and wind erosion. It will protect 3,578 ha of agricultural land.
Protection of agricultural land from soil and wind erosion are counted as
indirect benefits, which are measured using the standard issued by the
"Three-North Shelter Forest Program." In addition, afforestation will
improve the air quality because trees are very effective in absorption of
S02 and CO2. It is also expected that a 10-15 dB reduction of noise level
will be achieved at the area of the power plant. However, these two items
are not included in the benefit calculation.
(c)    Social benefit. Construction and operation of a power plant on a scale of
1,200 MW in one of the poorest counties in China will create jobs and
generate incomes in the region, and thus greatly alleviate poverty
conditions in Tuoketuo county. However, only the afforestation program
directly related social benefits are discussed here. The component will
provide 11 permanent jobs (in the implementation unit) as well as 2,260
persons for short-term afforestation work. Local people will also benefit
from the new technologies introduced in developing high-wind and

drought-resistant forestry.   Social benefits are not included in the
calculation of benefits.
12.   The cash flows are presented in Table 2 and 3. An IERR of 20 percent is obtained
for the whole component and 30% for Part A.

ANNEX 4.9: LAND ACQUISITION AND RELOCATION
General
1.    Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant and Beijing T&D are the two main components of
the project. Both components involve land acquisition, and relocation of population. The
resettlement for the former takes place in the rural area in Inner Mongolia and for the
latter in the urban area of Beijing. The priority was given to minimize the scope of
resettlement throughout the project design and planning. Where land acquisition and
demolition of existing housing are unavoidable, the resettlement plans provide for
replacement of housing, agricultural land, infrastructure, services and other resources.
The RAPs aim at improving the standards of living of the PAPs or at least to restoring
them.
2.    For Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant, the resettlement will be carried out in two
phases. The first phase includes resettlement activities related to the power plant site and
the ash disposal site and the second phase includes resettlement activities related to the
railway connection and the water intake line from Yellow River. A Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) has been prepared for the first phase. The RAP for the second phase will be
prepared by mid-1997 following the completion of the design of the railway connection
and the water intake line. A separate RAP has been prepared for the Beijing T&D
component. The Bank carried out full review of the RAPs and the assessment found that
the resettlement needs of the Project-Affected Persons (PAP) are well analyzed and
methods of mitigating the adverse impacts are thoroughly formulated. The Bank's
comments on how to improve the prepared RAP are being taken into account by TEPGC
and NCPGC in finalization of their RAP prior to the appraisal mission.
3.   In connection with construction of Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant, three 500 kV
transmission lines and associated sub- and switching stations will be constructed under a
separate project which does not involve World Bank funding.  A framework of
resettlement policy and organization has been prepared by NCPGC. It is assured (a) that
the RAP for the 500 kV transmission project will be prepared in accordance with the laws
and regulations of China as well as the Guidelines of the World Bank (Operational
Directive 4.30) and (b) that the living standard of the Project-Affected Persons (PAP) will
improve or at least be restored after the project implementation.
Scope
4.    Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant.  Tuoketuo thermal power plant includes
construction of a new power plant consisting of 2 x 600 MW coal-fired units. The site of
the power plant is located in Yanshanying Township of Tuoketuo County, Huhhot City.
The project area includes power station boundary, ash yard, dedicated railroad and water



-130-                      ANNEX4.9
intake line from Yellow River which involve three counties and ten townships. The
region has vast territory and a sparse population. Except for agricultural production, no
other industry is developed. The plant site and the ash yard will cover 360 ha of land and
involve Tuoketuo County, two townships and nine villages. No public facilities and
enterprises exist in the area. The plant will require: (a) land acquisition of about 836 ha
(12,541 mu), of which 465 ha (55.6 percent) is cultivated land, and (b) demolition of 27
2
houses with a total floor space of 3,340 m . The total number of the affected persons is
2,253.
5.    Beijing T&D. Xibianmen substation is located in the inner city of Beijing. The
2
construction of Xibianmen requires acquisition of 6,100 m  of land, demolition of 239
houses, and relocation of 935 persons. It also requires demolition of five small shops
with an average area of 7 m2 and a small amount of public facilities (including 360 m of
rainwater pipe, 260 m of tapwater pipe, 270 m of heating pipe, 12 power poles, and 12
telephone wire poles). However, this program is part of a wider planned program of the
urban renovation and development of Beijing under the responsibility of Beijing
Municipal Construction Development Corporation (BMCDC). The majority of the
residential houses to be demolished are old and hazardous with poor sanitation facilities.
There is no resettlement need for Wangfujing and Xizhimen because the former is an
underground substation under construction and the latter will be built using the site of the
existing 110 kV substation. The pilot project of distribution rehabilitation involves
mainly reconductoring and installation of compact transformers and capacitors and does
not require any resettlement.
Legal Framework for Land Acquisition, Demolition, Relocation and Resettlement
6.    The Bank Requirements. The RAPs have been prepared in line with the
requirements contained in the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.30: Involuntary
Resettlement as well as applicable national and local laws and regulations.
National and Local Laws and Regulations
7.    The main state law "Land Management Law of the People's Republic of China,"
which was enacted in 1988, has been applied to the both components. The local laws and
regulations that are applied respectively to the two components are as follows.
8.    The local implementation regulations applied to Tuoketuo thermal power plant
include: Implementation of "The Land Management Law of the People's Republic of
China" issued by Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and "Land Management Method
of Huhhot" which was ratified by the Huhhot Municipality in 1992.
9.    Local laws and regulations issued by Beijing Municipal Authorities and applied to
Beijing T&D component include: "Implementing Measures of Land Management Law
of People's Republic of China," "Fine Penalty Regulations for the Implementing
Measures of Land Management Law of People's Republic of China," and "Implementing



- 131 -                    ANNEX 4.9
Measures on Provisional Regulations of Use-Right Grant and Assignment of City and
Town State-Owned Land of People's Republic of China."
10.   During the preparation of RAPs, it was made sure that all the resettlement
activities and compensation policies are strictly governed by the applicable laws,
regulations and the Bank Guidelines.  Arrangements for relocation, prepared in
collaboration with local authorities and the population affected by the project, are in line
with Chinese national and provincial policies. Special attention was given to the most
vulnerable groups (households headed by women, senior people and poorest households).
Compensation Policies and Rates
11.   Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant. Based on the national and local regulations of
the province and city, it is determined for the Tuoketuo Power Project that compensation
for cultivated land is 4.5 times of average output value per mu for three years before land
acquisition. Compensation for woodland will be implemented according to three times
cumulative value of grown timber and wood compensation is based on the cumulative
value of 6 m3 per mu.  For demolished and relocated houses, Tuoketuo County
Government allocated an area from the state-owned land for construction of a new village
for the PAP. TEPGC makes a financial contribution to it.
12.   The compensation rates are as follows:
Irrigated land: Y 8,336/mu
Nonirrigated land: Y 4,475/mu
Woodland: Y 3,176/mu
Subsidies for resettlement: Y 415.8/person
House: Y 612/m2
Public facility: Y 583/m2
Vegetable cellar: Y 7,500/each
Pumped well: Y 35,000/each
Brick kiln: Y 800,000/each
35kV transmission line: Y 100,000/km
10kV transmission line: Y 50,000/km
380v transmission line: Y 15,000/km
13.   Beijing T&D. The general compensation policy for residential houses is that the
resettled housing area shall not be less than the original floor space. For the residents
moved from within the second-ring-road section (inner city) into outside the third-ring-
road section, the resettled housing area shall be increased using a specified formula or a
lump sum compensation be paid off (Y 25,000-30,000). All the PAPs will be relocated
into new and higher-quality housing. Furthermore, the PAPs will be given a choice of
several resettlement locations. Compensation for the resettlement housing will be
calculated at replacement cost without depreciation.



-132-                      ANNEX4.9
14.   For residents who are living in a small house (or an apartment) with floor space
per capita below the current standard minimum living area in Beijing, the standard
minimum living area will be provided.
15.   For small shops, apart from the replacement cost of the shops, the relocation costs
and production losses during shutdown of business will also be compensated. For the
public facilities, the reconstruction (relocation) will be carried out on the basis of the
scale and quantity of the existing facilities following appropriate construction engineering
standards. Reconstruction will be completed before the existing facilities is removed.
16.   The applicable compensation rates are:
Land title: Y 4,000 /m2
House compensation, state-owned:  Y 15,000/bedroom, and private
owned: Y 20,000/bedroom

Compensation for TV antenna: Y 144
Compensation for school and kindergarten transfer: Y 3,000/person
Compensation for relocation to far-away areas: Y 500/person
Implementation Organization and Strategy
17.   A Project Resettlement Office with six staff members was established in May
1993 in TEPGC to oversee the management and implementation of resettlement
program. It will be assisted by Tuoketuo County Resettlement Office and Yanshanying
Township Resettlement Office. Two senior members of the office have received training
on involuntary resettlement sponsored by MOF.
18.   A Project Resettlement Office has been established to oversee the resettlement
work related to Xibianmen substation. It consists of representatives from Beijing
Municipal Power Supply Company (BMPSC), which is a division of NCPGC, BMCDC,
the Government of Xicheng District, and Beijing Municipality.
19.   For Tuoketuo thermal power plant, the new village will be constructed and made
available to PAP before December 31, 1996. After the completion of its construction and
the relocation of PAPs, demolition of the old houses will be carried out by owner
themselves. All the properties and materials of the old houses will belong to the resettled
households.
20.   The demolition and the rehabilitation of the houses will be completed before
March 1997 so that the spring plow of PAP would not be affected. Based on the
implementation plan, all PAP will be resettled near their original place. The new village
is within 300 meters of the existing village, and 250 meters of the Huhhot-Zhungeer
highway. All new houses will be built in bricks and wood. New public facilities will be



-133-                        ANNEX4.9
provided in the new village such as clinic, school, shopping and cultural centers.
Displaced farmers will continue their agricultural activities in the newly reclaimed
agricultural lands in new irrigation areas. Four motor-pumped wells will be installed for
irrigation purposes.
21.   The preparation for the construction of the new houses has already been carried
out. The design of the new house of each household affected by the project will be
carried out by the resettlement office of the county in consultation with the PAP. The
construction will be carried out by the local construction teams.
22.   The principle to minimize the resettlement of PAP as much as possible for
selection of the site and the ash yard was fully taken into consideration. Therefore, the
project will have less influence on the electrical, communication and other utility
facilities. Power supply, communication and other facilities for the construction of the
new village and for the exploitation of the new lands will be completed during the
rehabilitation. All roads through the site or ash yard will be relocated outside them. All
canals and ditches will be reconstructed outside the power plant area.
23.   Displaced households by Xibianmen substation will be relocated in new
apartment buildings with modem  facilities in a close-by residential areas, namely:
Majiabao, Donguantou, and Yalin. As housing is already commercialized in China,
NCPGC will purchase houses for the PAP in these three residential areas. All of them
can fully meet various requirement of residence in terms of comfort and convenience.
Consultation will be made on a household by household basis with the PAP regarding
their needs. All the public facilities such as road, water supply, sewage, heating, gas, and
electricity as well as auxiliary service facilities such as education, health, commerce,
garden and cultural facilities in these three areas will be completed before December
1996.
Cost Estimates
24.   The cost estimates are provided below. The total resettlement costs including
contingencies for the two components amount to Y 296.5 million.

Resettlement Monitoring
26.   TEPGC and NCPGC respectively contracted the Inner Mongolia Academy of
Social Science (IMASS) and the Beijing Social and Psychological Research Institute
(BSPRI) to monitor the resettlement activities and provide an independent evaluation of
resettlement. The monitoring and evaluation will be based on a sample of 10 to 15
percent of affected population. The objective of monitoring and evaluation is to ensure
that the resettlement program is implemented smoothly and that the standards of living of
the PAPs are improved or at least restored during the first year following their
resettlement. The agreed outline of the first-year monitoring report includes reviewing
resettlement progress among all components; examining the use of resettlement finds;
and assessing situation regarding production restoration among relocated population, if
any; living condition improvements (housing and related services and facilities); and
administration capacity of resettlement organizations.  The group will produce a
resettlement progress report for the project office and the Bank every six months during
implementation of resettlement and annually thereafter.  After the completion of
resettlement implementation, a resettlement evaluation report will be completed.
Conflict Resolution and Grievance Procedure
27.   PAPs with grievances will be able to submit their complaints to the implementing
and supervising authorities of the project and are assured to receive a response within one
month of the submission date.

TEPGC's managerial, legal, technical and financial capabilities. The main objectives of
the program are:
(a)   to staff TEPGC with professionally skilled personnel capable of handling
power development and financial planing, power sector reform, tariff
reform, and advanced operation and maintenance techniques; and
(b)   to enable TEGPC to function as an autonomous and commercially-
oriented entity
B. SCOPE
2.    The training program will consist of the following three main categories:
(a)   training of personnel, managerial, planning, financial, legal, technical, and
environmental fields;
(b)   on-the-job training of technical staff assisted by consultants and
international experts; and
(c)   upgrading and equipping TEPGC's training facilities.
3.    High-level management, planning and financial staff will receive training in
modem management and decision-making techniques, particularly in utility management,
planning of investments, power sector reform and power pricing reform, financial
operations and management information systems. Engineering personnel will also
receive training in their specific fields, especially those related to large thermal power
construction and operation, such as advanced plant operation and preventive
maintenance, etc.
4.    Project-related training will include: (a) on-the-job training of engineering and
construction management staff by working together with the foreign consultants;
