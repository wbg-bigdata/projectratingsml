The following is a Project Coplotion Report on the Road
Maintenance and fohabilitation Project ln Bellis for which Loan 2273-BIL,
in the souct of US$5.3 million, ws approved by the Board on Mey 3, 1983.
At the time of writing this report, US$5.1 million wee disbursed, and the
Borrower is preparing about US$0.2 million in additional disbursement
applications, to be submicttd before the 6-month extended disbursement
period expires. The Government and the Bank are considering tho
possibility of including civil works fore- minor part of on* component
which were not implemented through exhaustion of the relovant category,
under a proposed second loan to Belise.
This completion report was prepared by the 3ank's Latin Amorica
and the Caribbean Regional Office and is based on information obtained from
the LAC Information Center, Appraisal and Supervision Reports for Loan
2273-BEL and final reports from the consultants involved in the project.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project
performance audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was nct audited by
OdD staff. The draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments; their
re"ly is sho-r as an annex to the re'ort.

m*OJCT COK"LlION REPORT
LOAN 2273-M
Xlahliahts
The load Maintenance and Rehabilitation Projoct was the first Bank
transportation loan to the Government of Belise and was copleted as scheduled
with minimal problems.
Civil Works Comonents
The rehabilitation of three soctions (approximately 21 miles) of
principal roads was delayed when the contractor for the asection San Ignacio to
Belmopan Entranc- Rood (8 miles) dofaulrod due to the lack of construction
equipment. MOW had to complete the rehabilitation as a force account project
using MOW equipment and personnel, under the guidance of the supervision
consultant. (paras. 3.06 to 3.08)
The drainage improvements of 65 miles of the Southern Highway as
proposed in the SAR was reduced by six miles due to additional costs incurred
in the other components of the loan. The Government and the World Bank are
considering the possibility of including the completion of drainAge
improvements for the Southern Highway as L component in a proposed seccnd
loan. (paras. 3.18 to 3.24)
Achievements under the project in the area of road maintenance were
less than expected and mostly limited to the benefits derived from the use of
the new equipment procured urder the loan.  One of the more positive results
of the project was the installation and operation by MOW of a plant to produce
reinforced concrete pipes to be used on all MOW projects in Belize.
Manufacture of the pipes has been so successful that MOW has been able to
become a supplier for the private sector at prices lower than import costs
while still showing a profit for MOW. (para. 3.03)
Road Maintenance and Training
The road maintenance program included in this project focused on the
acquisition of equipment and spare parts, improvement of MOW's equipment
workshops, institution strengthening and training. The PCR critically
examines the probable reasons for the minimal impact of this project component
and attributes the results to a shortage of qualified staff and oversophisti-
cation of the system put in place by the maintenance consultant. The costs
are not justified by the resulting Improvements to the road maintenance
program. (paras. 3.26 to 3.40)

Lessone
The principal leee.m learned from thia project is the need for
tailoring construction, malntenance, nd  institution strongthen2a  inputs
financod by Bank loans to the absorptive capacity of the recipient countryl
and, in cses where there is a dearth of trained personnel and physical and
financial resources in the public administration and local contracting
industry, to design technical and financial *sistance Inputs which are
managed by capable consultants who understand the level of developmnt which
they =at reach with the support progrm they dsign.



ROAD 14AINTKC  AND REAILITATION PROJECT
LON 273- = 
PROJECT C
1. INTRODCTIO
1.01     Belize, located in the Yuctan Peninsula in Central America,
borders with Mexico on the north  ad with Guatesala on tho West end Soutn.
Beliso ha en are- of 8,866 square nils and a very low population desdity,
with only soas 150,000 living in its territory. Infrastructure is still a
major constraint to development and *specially officient transportation is
essential to Belize's economy which is heavily dependent on export
agriculture. However, the low population donsity makes for relatively high
transport infrastructure investment costs por capita. Transportation costs
aro also high because of the long distances between widely scattered,
sparsely populatedi regions.
1.02     Belize's major road system is generally adequate but does not
provide for alternative routing to any of the main centers. The lack of
efficient maintenance is therefore a serious constraint to development.
The road system totals about 1,085 miles of improved roads (of which about
250 are paved), some 200 miles of unimproved roads and tracks, and 280
mile5 of urban streets. The Government has, in recent years, made
substantial investments in the development and improvement of this system
but poor design standards, inadequate maintenance and poor construction
methods and materials have resulted in facilities that do not provide an
adequate traffic service. The project therefore focused on the planning,
preparation, and implementation of a maintenance and rehabilitation program
for the system, to improve the level of traffic service to meet the needs
of the users.
1.03     Because a basic road system is in place in Belize, future
investment planning should ensure a proper balance between network
development and a maintenance and rehabilitation program to improve
operation and safe'ty on the existing road system.
1.04     The project was designed to support a four-year Road Maintenance
and Rehabilitation Program to be implemented by the Ministry of Works
(MOW). A study included in the project, the Export Transportation Master
Plan, had the objective of assisting in the development of mediua r: ngo
plans for the improvement of both land and maritime distribution of goods.
The project was the first direct Bank group operation in Belize since it
became independent in September 1982 and it financed non-recurrent costs of
the overall maintenance and rehabilitation program, while remaining capital
costs were financed by the Government and by external sources, such as the
British Development Division (BDD).

1.05     T.is completion report is bseod upon information obtained from the
LAC Information Center, Appraisal and Supervision Reports for Loan 2273-BEL
and final reports from the consultants involved in the project. The
Borrower did not prepare a Project Completion Report.
11. PROJECT MREPRATION, APPAISAL AND N100TIATIONS
2.01     The Road Rahabilitation and Maintenance Project was designed to
support MOW's Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Progrm for 1983:64
through 1986/87 with the objectives of: (a) strengthening MOW's road
maintenane capacity through improvemeuts in Its organization and the
introducticn of improved maintenance standards and proceduresl (b) ensuring
a sufficient supply of road maintenance equipment and vehicles and
improving iquipment availability and utilization; (e) upgrading, through
training, of saintenance manpower; (d) improving the support functions for
road design and construction on quality control; and (e) bringing priority
roads to maintainable condition through rehabilitation and drainage
improvements.
2.02     No formal transport planning existed in B-lize; however, a United
Nations Development Program/Office of Project Execution (UNDP/OPE) financed
Belize Public Investment Project, which commenced in early 1982, fostered
planning of infrastructure investments. MOW prepared, with the assistance
of consultants, a Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program for 1983/84
through 1986/87.aimed at strengthening its road and equipment maintenance
organization as well as providing a more comprehensive approach to the
rehabilitation of the road network. The Bank project was to support a
slice of the program. The BDD would also be a major contributor.
2.03     Consulting firms assisted the Government in reviewing the status
of the road maintenance organization and operations, and in carrying out
detailed engineering design for roads to be rehabilitated with Bank
financing.
2.04     A preparation mission visited Belize in September 1982 and agreed
with MOW on the need for a comprehensive Action Program for the preparation
of a Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program. A Bank consultant
assisted MOW in its preparation. This program incorporated planned
investment by the Bank and the BDD. The program would, by the end of the
four-year period, provide for the resealing of 30 miles per year and the
regraveling of 120 miles per year. To meat the goals of the road
maintenance program, equipmenWt   ailability and utilization was to increase
to 75% and 1,200 hours respectively by 1986/87 and a training program
implemented.
2.05     The project was a .praised in November/December 1982 and an Issues
Paper was circulated on De ember 22, 1982.  The Decisior Memorandum dated
January 12, 1983 addressed the following issues:
(a) Changes from Project Brief provisions: (i) ic had been envisaged
that the project would finance rehabilitation of the Hummingbird



-3-
Highway, but further investigation by a Bank consultant indicated
that such rehabilitation would be considerably more costly than
anticipated, and the appraisal mission determined that the
relatively low traffic levels on this road did not provide adequate
benefits to make the works econo eally viable at that time
(ii) the scope of the work on the Southern BHihway wee chonged to
provide only for drainage iprovements along that route; (iWi) the
rehabilitation of the Santa Elena-Corosal (1f miles) and Haulover
Bridge-Airport Junction (3 siles) sections was addel to the program
at the request of MOW;
(b) endorsement of the appraisal mission's proposal for an advance of
US$210,000 to finance detailed engineering and initial technical
assistance;
(c)  agreement with the appraisal mission's recommendation that
retroactive financing up to US$165,000 be approved for road
equipment spare parts, and workshop improvements; and
(d) agreement that the preparation of the Export Transportation Master
Plan should be a condition for the Bank to finance the project.
2.06      Negotiations took place on March 21.  They concluded on the
understanding that, depending upon the results of detailed engineering, which
was in progress at the time, the scope of the road rehabilitation works and
the amount of the Bank loan could be subject to modification. A loan
amounting to US$5.3 million was approved by the Executive Directors on May 3,
1983 and the Loan Agreement was signed on May 13, 1983. After the completion
of detailed engineering in June 1983, two amendments to the Loan Agreement
were made:
la) since about 7 miles of one of the road sections included in the
project (San Ignacio-Belmopan entrance) had been partially
rehabilitated by the Government with the assistance of the BDD and
had been further improved after appraisal, they were deleted from
the project;
(b) the amount of the Bank loan was increased from US$5.0 million to
US$5.3 million. The cost of the project was estimated at US$7.12
million (originally US$6.75 million), including US$5.3 million in
foreign exchange. The increase was attributable to higher-than-
estimated base costs of civil works and the necessity to increase
physical contingencies from 10% to 15% mainly because subsoil
conditions in the project area presented greater uncertainties than
originally envisaged.
2.07      The approved p-oject elements and their estimated costs, as given in
the appraisal report, are shown in Table 1.

III. PROJECT EXECUTION
A. CIVIL WORKS
3.01      A Nov Zealand consultant firm was appointed on 25th February 1983 to
undertake thb  design and supervision of construction of the road
rehabilitation and drainage improvment works.  Work coumenced on survey and
design on March 7, 1983. The design together with the preparation of contract
documents was completed at the ond of June 1983. In the process, the
consultants trained local staff in surveying for road rehabilitation projects
and in testing existing road pavement characteristics. However, insufficient
time was available during the design period to provide training in highway
design. The preparation of highway design plans, specifications, cost
estimates and contract documents was undertaken in the consultant's home
office.
3.02      For bidding purposeos, the work was divided into six separate
contracts, three for the rehabilitation of existing roads and three for
drainage improvement works (Table 2 provides information on contracts and cost
data for the various civil works). After prequalification of contractors, bid
opening for the first section took place in June 1983. All the contracts were
let through LCB.
3.03      Survey and design, contract documents and procedures, and
supervision of the rehabilitation and drainage by the New Zealand consulting
firm, was satisfactory. Two important additional achievements were realized
in 1983/84 by the engineering and supervision consultants: (a) savings of some
US$28,500 and BZ$ 13,000 on their contract with MOW for the design of road
rehabilitation and drainage works permitted MOW to use the funds to finance a
training program, in bituminous road work, in New Zealand for three MOW
supervisors and one engineer; and (b) the upgrading and operation of a
concrete pipe manufacturing plant in Belize. The main objective of the latter
was for MOW to reduce the high cost of imported pipe culverts needed for
Section D2 of the drainage improvements (para 3.20). The consultants arrang.:
for MOW staff to be assigned to work in contractors' yards, manufacturing
pipes for ongoing contracts, to learn the necessary skills. At present the
Ministry manufactures pipes on a permanent basis for gener.l use in Belize.
The final cost of the consultants' services was US$0.56 million,  11% of c ;.
works.
(i) Road Rehabilitation Work
(a) San Ignacio-Belmopan Entrance
(Western Highway and Hummingbird Highway)
(Section A)
3.04      The work in these two highways consisted originally of 15 miles of
pavement rehabilitation; approximately 13 1/2 of the Western Highway,and one
and one-half of the Hummingbird Highway. However, after the appraisal
mission, the MOW undertook some improvement work on the Western Highway under
a previous BDD improvement program, and work on the Western Highway under this
project was limited to approximately seven and one-half miles.

3.05      Thirteen contractors applied for prequalification, but only ten were
considered suitable. The contract was awarded about six months after bid
opening, on December 13, 1983, to a joint venture of two Belize contractors.
This delay resulted from the need to organize seminars to familiarize the
contractors with the requirements of bid preparation, and construction
procedures. The contract period was of 12 months. After further delays, work
on site comenced in late January 1984.
3.06      Major problems developed almost from the start of construction, due
largely to the inexperience of the joint venture partners, over-coiitment of
resources, and under-capitalisation. Eventually, non-performance of the
contract works by the joint venture led, in November 1984, to termination of
the contract. Negotiations were then entered into with one of the partners of
the joint venture, to complete all remaining works. These were successful.
and on December 5, 1964, the contractor undertook to complete the drainage
works on Section Dl (para 3.18), and employed the MOW as subcontractor to
complete the road rehabilitation works.
3.07      The subcontract with the MOW proceeded very slowly through the first
half of 1985 due mostly to the lack of construction equipment which had been
shifted to another contract for the construction of drainage works on the
Southern Highway. Inclement weather during this period also slowed the work.
However, during the latter half of the year the Ministry, assisted by the
consultants, intensified the construction activity and Section A was
substantially completed at the end of February 1986, 12 months later than the
original contract period, and one month later than appraisal estimate. The
consultant's contract was extended to cover the additional period.
3.08      The final value of the works in this contract amounted to
US$2,263,954, compared with the original joint venture tender of US$1,189,428.
(b) Haulover Bridge-Airport Junction
(Section B)
3.09      After the experience in contracting out Section A (para 3.05), it
became apparent that the local firms had little knowledge in organizing and
executing road works under rigorous specifications. Therefore, the
cousultants decided to organize and run formal training courses for local
contractors before inviting tenders for the other sections of the project.
Furthermore, MOW decided that adequate prequalification of contractors would
be critical and the matter of performance bonds would be given special
attention.
3.10      Bids for this section were invited from prequalified contractors on
December 18, 1984. Only one bid was received, from a Belize contractor.
Acceptance of the bid was recommended by the consultants at the end of
February 1985, but the contract was not awarded until April 22, 1985 due to a
delay in land acquisition and tree clearance along the route, which was to be
undertaken by MOW. Due to the importance of the road, the work was to be
completed in six months.
3.11      Considerable additional work was made necessary by the
accelerated rate of scour noted in the section adjacent to the Belize river,
resulting from a shift in the river channel, and wave action from passing



-6 -
power boats. In three locations, scour endangered the integrity of the
rehabilitated highway and protective works had to be implemented. Two months
were added to the contract to complete the work on these variations. The work
was successfully completed in a total of eight months.
3.12      After completion of construction, the supervising consultant
recoiended that the NOW carry out site investigations oavr the length of
highway affected by foundation failures and the scour of the river bank, and
implement the further protection works considered necessary.
3.13      The completion certificate was issued on December 12, 1985.  The
final contract value was US$953,798 which included the variations in the
section adjacent to the Belize river (para. 3.11). The final contract value
did not exceed the original contract sum inclvding contingencies of
US$1,044,861.
(c)  Santa Elena-Corazal
(Section C)
3.14      Some delays occurred in the award of a contract for this section,
while alternative solutions were considered for the provision of base course
(crushed material had to be brought from a distance of 150 km). After
carrying out tests, the consultant recommended the use of cement-stabilized
marl, and a contract was awarded in June 1984, to the same Belize contractor
responsible for Section B. The stabilized marl base proved successful, and
resulted in considerable savings, of about US$17,000 per km.
3.15      Work commenced in August 1984, six weeks after entering into the
contract. This delay arose because the contractor, although experienced in
earthworks and drainage contracts, had no previous experience in the total
scope of road rehabilitation works and had to participate in the Consultants's
training workshops, and hire an experienced construction supervisor and
foreman. However, the other applicants had the same limited experience Ln
this type of works.
3.16      Despite the delay in commencing the work, the completion certificate
was issued on May 3, 1985, almost two months ahead of the progrenmed
completion date. The final contract value was US$1,319,986 as compared with
the original bid sum (US$1,221,103).
(ii) Southern Highway Drainage
3.17      The purpose of this component was to improve culverts, their
outlets, and side drains in order to alleviate seasonal flooding that often
resulted in road closure every rainy season. As the work under this category
of the project was expected to be within the capability of many local
contractors, it was divided into three contracts in order to make it
accessible to a wide range of local contractors.
(a) Contract Dl: Humming Bird Intersection to Sittee River
(Mile 0 to Mile 13)
3.18      Bids were submitted by three prequalified contractors (two national,
one foreign); a contract for this section was awarded to the same Belize joint



- 7 -
venture originally in charge of Section A, on December 13, 1983. However, the
contract documentation was not completed until March 23, 1984 due to the
partners' difficulties in obtaining suitable insurance and bonding. The
contract period was six months.
3.19      This contract was affected by the *_  ttpe of difficulties which
besJt Section A; poor coordination *mnng the joint v-nture partners, poor site
managament, and seizure of earthmoving equipment by creditors hampered
progress of the work. Work was completed, even though with a substantial
delay, using hired equipment and by shifting equipment from section A. The
contract was eventually completed over a period of 14 months, compared with
the original estimate of 6 months. The original contract value was US$514,271
and the final certified sum was US$555,916. The contractors manufactured
their own reinforced concrete pipes on site.
(b) Contract D2: Sittee River to Big Creek
(Mile 13 to Mile 40)
3.20      Bids received for this section were 100 percent over the engineer's
estimate because of the high price for imported concrete pipes proposed in the
bids. Rebidding therefore became necessary and was first scheduled for June
1984. By that date, MOW was scheduled to supply the pipes from its own
manufacturing facility in Belmopan. Actual bidding closed on September 13,
1984 and five bids were received. The contract was awarded on December 5,
1984 to a Beiize contractor and the period of the contract was nine months.
The delay in awarding the contract was due to delays in the manufacture of
pipes by MOW, while its personnel was trained by working alongside the
contractors in Section Dl.
3.21      A further cause for delay was MOW's decision to instruct the
consultants to organize and run formal training courses for local contractors.
It had become apparent that the local firms who were awarded the first two
contracts, had little experience in organizing and executing road construction
work under rigorous specifications. Participation in these courses by local
firms was a prerequisite for tendering on Sections B, D2 and D3.
3.22      For several months there was little progress in this contract, due
to the absence of responsible staff from the contractor on site, poor
planning, and lack of suitable equipment. However, following several site
demonstrations by the consultants using improved construction techniques, work
on this section progressed more rapidly. The original contractor
substantially completed the works in March 1986, with a six-month delay.
3.23      The original contract sum was US$844,445, including contingency and
day works amounts. The final contract sum was US$912,827.
(c)  Contract Li: Big Creek to Deep River
(Mile 40 to Mile 65)
3.24      Work on this section was postponed due to the need to reallocate
funds to categories that were short, such as the maintenance, training, and
planning consultants' fees and the purchase of equipment (para 4.04). This
resulted in reducing the scope of improvements on this section from the
original proposal for improvements to 24 miles to 18 miles. However, work was



-8 -
not completed until February 1987, two months after th- loan closing date due
to mechanical problems with two excavators. The original contract cost was
US$890,054 and the final cost for the shortez section was US$550,000.
(iii) Suvervision
3.25      Work by the consultant in charge of survey and design, contract
documents and procedures, and supervision of road rehabilitation and drainage
improvements was very good, and helped overcome many practical problems of
implementation. The consultant's construction supervision contract was
completed at the end of February 1986, after an extension of one month. At
the completion of the consultant's contract, all works under the project had
been substantially completed with the exception of drainage improvement works
on part of the Southern Highway, and the asphaltic surface treatment of one
short section of the road rehabilitation works (Western Highway from Esperanza
to Santa Elena). Supervision of the completion of these works was undertaken
by the MOW, who is also undertaking the maintenance inspections of all other
works contained in the project. The cost of design and supervision was
US$506,679.
B.   ROAD MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING
(i) Road Maintenance Program
3.26      After reviewing proposals from five firms, on June 7, 1983 a
contract was awarded to an American consulting firm to perform the consulting
services required to implement a road maintenance management system and
training system. The consultants would provide technical assistance for a
total of 48 man-months, starting July 22, 1983. The results of this work are
discussed under the general heading of Technical Assistance, paras. 3.32 et
seq.
(ii) Equipment Procurement and Management and Workshop Improvements
3.27      The project included a component for the procurement of spare parts
for maintenance equipment, and tools and equipment for workshop improvements.
Local procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank were developed. Table 3
shows a list of the contracts awarded under this category. In addition, some
spare parts for specific units of equipment were purchased through direct
negotiation with the suppliers, in order to complete the parts requirement in
the Equipment Rehabilitation Program. Some US$30,000 were spent on training
personnel abroad.
(a) Spare Parts Procurement and Equipment Overhaul
3.28      The consultants prepared a list of spare parts for maintenance
equipment. Equipment spares were procured for some 29 units (versus 25 at
appraisal) which were repaired at MOW workshops. The actual cost was
US$126,178.91 while the cost estimated at appraisal had been US$150,000.00.
(b) Workshop Equipment and Tools
3.29      Three quotations were received by MOW for the supply of tools and
workshop equipment for use in the Central Workshop in Belmopan and in some



-9 -
districts. The list in Table 3.2 of the Appraisal Report, was increased to
reflect the new needs of MOW. The appraisal estimate was US$35,000 while the
contract was awarded to the lowest bidder for US$58,603. Eleven pieces of
road maintenance equipment and related parts were also purchased, at a cost of
US$98,500.
3.30      Procedures and forms were developed in order to establish a
continuous equipment inventory system which included technical data about each
individual unit, location, and a condition classification. Furthermore, the
organization and operations of the workshop and stores were improved.
Preventive maintenance procedures were implemented, and equipment cost control
procedures and budgeting were introduced. The consultants also prepared an
equipment replacement program, describing a four-year equipment replacement
strategy, and a further US$154,868 of road maintenance equipment was purchased
to balance the fleet and increase the overall efficiency.
3.31      The long term effectiveness of such effort will depend upon the
willingness of MOW to follow the consultants' recommendations and upon the
availability of the technical assistance which will be required by MOW to
implement these recommendations.
(iii) Technical Assistance
(a)Road Maintenance
3.32      The institution building objectives envisaged during appraisal in
the area of road maintenance, were achieved only in part. The aim of the Road
Maintenance Unit1   was to develop and implement system elements for planning,
organizing and managing road maintenance work. However, oversophistication of
the maintenance management system implemented by the maintenance consultants
and the lack of time available for focusing upon the execution of the work
program seriously limited the achievements of this part of the project.
3.33      The objective of this component was to increase MOW's capacity to
plan and implement a four-year road maintenance program. This was to be
achieved by strengthening MOW's road management, and by improving the
maintenance organization. Tne poor level of road maintenance in Belize had
its roots in several basic deficiencies, including lack of planning for
routine and periodic maintenance, insufficient maintenance budget and low
equipment utilization.
3.34      The maintenance Consultants' efforts in this area were addressed -
(i) the implementation of a Maintenance Management System (MMS) in all six
districts of the country. The development of the system included planning c:
the maintenance workload, developing maintenance programs and performance
budgeting. The major accomplishments were an inventory of the road network
and the identification of resource requirements. Sufficient time was not
available for focusing upon the execution of the work program. For example,
implementation of the 1984/85 work program and budget started in April 1987,
and the Maintenance Engineer's time was up as of July 15, 1984. This period
was not long enough to provide a data base for analysis and most of the time
1/ Which was established by the maintenance consultants to assist in the
design and implementation of the maintenance management system.



_ 10 -
of the Maintenance Engineer was taken up in writing up an unnecessarily
sophisticated IMMS; (ii) Road Network Inventory: The national road network was
inventoried by surface width, type, cross section, and condition;
(iii) Preparation of Work Programs and Performance Budgetst Manual and
computerized procedur-s were used to prepare road maintenance work programs
and perform-nce budgets for each highway maintenance district, by road section
and activity. A weekly reporting procedure was instituted in order to
determine the effectiveness of preparing the work progrms and budgets; and
(iv) Installation of an IBM/PC Com.uter and Pre*aration of Maintenance
Manuals.
3.35      The cost of the technical assistance to develop a system  for
planning of mai ntenance operations and for control of the work programs
prepared for each maintenance district was US$660,500. This was a
considerable financial outlay, which resulted in a very complex system being
developed. It was not possible to test it during the consultants' sojourn.
In fact, the maintenance planning operations deteriorated following the
departure of the consultants. The lack of monitoring and the complexity and
oversophistication of the system are the main problems. Further Bank
assistance may be required, through a future loan, to simplify aid improve the
NMS system.
(b) Accounting and Administration
3.36      The weakest area of the project was in the accounting and
administration component. The terms of reference of the maintenance
consultants required them to improve the MOW's fiscal and cost accounting
procedures. This was not achieved because of lack of sufficient trained
personnel, and time to implement the program. The MMS developed for MOW by
the consultants provided the mechanisms necessary to identify quantities of
work by maintenance activity and district in the form of a performance-
oriented budget. The MMS included the calculation of unit costs for labor,
equipment, and materials, the preparation and processing of monthly reports
and the maintenance of equipment inventory and depreciation schedule.
However, the system was too complex for a first time endeavor and the training
of field and office personnel in the preparation and use of cost information
was not sufficient. Furthermore, the supervision and coordination of the
implementation of elements of the cost accounting system, which had to be
loaded and run on a single micro-computer, and which could onlv be operated b,
two staff members of MOW, was not sufficient to enable the system to be fully
implemented after the maintenance Consultants' departure.
(c) Training
3.37      The primary objectives of this component of the project were to
train highway maintenance personnel and ensure nationwide uniformity in the
work methods and procedures used for highway maintenance. The issues paper
considered the implementation of a training program, with a Road Training
Production Unit (RTPU) as its key element, vital to the improvement of MOW's
road maintenance capability.
3.38      The 1983-84 training program for highway maintenance personnel was
directed to road foremen (12), equipment operators and drivers (36), with
mechanics, accountants, clerks and storekeepers receiving in-service



- 11 -
upgrading. Training of road foremen, equipment operators, and drivers,
totalling 96 trainees was carried out by the RTPU while at the same time
performing maintenance operations on selected pavod and graveled road sections
in each of the six districts. In-service training of mechanics as
U*pl_mented by the MOW workshop superintendent under the guidance of the
maintenance consultant'e mechanical engineer. The lellse District training
cycle was poetpon.d due to everoe weather conditions and equipment *hortages
in this District, and the RTPU became inactive. The NOW should reactivate the
RTPU when the equipment problem  are rosolved.  Hands-on training throagh the
RTPU for field personnel of MOW has therefore had limited success.
3.39      The maintenance consultant in charge of the unit had a good academic
background but little practical experience, and training only improved after
another expert joined the RTPU. The training program for MOW administrative
personnel in road maintenance produced some positive results in maintenance
management and computer applications, but without adequate follov-up the
benefits will lapse.
3.40      The maintenance consultants' final report was issued in December
1984. The total man-months used was fifty-seven, and materials were purchased
for an amount of US$70,000.
C.   EXPORT TRANSPORTATION MASTER PLAN STUDY
3.41      One of Belize's highest priorities in the transportation sector is
the improvement of maritime transport terminals, to improve the handling of
imports and agricultural exports. The Loan Agreement included funds for the
preparation of a master plan to map out policies and strategies for improving
the movement of Belize's exports, particularly by increasing the efficiency of
the ports. The Export Transportation Master Plan Study was contracted in
December 1984 with an American consulting firm, after delays in the review by
MOW of the final evaluation of the consultants' proposal. Five proposals from
consultants have been received and evaluated, and the contract was let for a
value of US$135,000.
3.42      The study concluded that major improvements involving capital
investments in the port sector were not warranted, due to the existence of
reasonably adequate port facilities in good condition which were not being
used to their full capacity. Furthermore, the consultants found that it is
unlikely that traffic will develop in the foreseeable future to the extent
that would justify further capital investments.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01      A comparison of appraisal estimates and final costs for the civil
works component is shown in Table 2. The final cost of the project was
US$8,536,338 million, which compares with the appraisal estimate of US$7.12
million.
4.02      The allocation of loan funds was revised three times, as shown in
Table 4. The first reallocatfon in September 1983 referred to the Project
Preparation Facility of US$210,000, approved in March 1983 to meet expected



- 12 -
payments to consultants engaged by the Government of Bolize for detailed
engineering and other preparatory work in connection with the proposed
project. The loan became effective on August 1983 and, since no withdrawals
had been made from the advance, the US$210,000 was transferred to Category 3
(Consultants).
4.03      The second reallocation was made necessary to extend the supervision
consultants' contract by two months, to assist MOW in the direct
implementation of the Section A works, after enforced termination of the
construction contract (par&. 3.06). Furthermore, since the funds for five
categories (1A, 1C, 2A, 2B and 3) were overdrawn, a wider reallocation was
also necessary. The new allocation was approved by the Bank on January 24,
1986.
4.04      In June 1986, the Borrower requested an end-of-project reallocation
of funds from Categories 1B to 1A in order to complete, as far as possible,
the Section D3 drainage works. The Bank adjusted the request in order to
provide additional funds under Category 3 (Consultants) which was overdrawn by
approximately US$6,500, in the studies and technical assistance components.
The Bank agreed to the final reallocation on July 18, 1986.
4.05      The need to increase the volume of work on Section D3 led to nigher-
than-programed costs and MOW was unable to finance and carry out woaks on the
last six kilometers of the seccion. Supplementary Bank financing to complete
the drainage works over this length is included in the initial Project Brief
for a Second Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project.
4.06      The current status of disbursements is shown in Table 5.
4.07      Loan funds were disbursed at a faster rate than expected at the time
of appraisal, as shown in Table 6, with the exception of the final US$0.2
million, which will cover additional costs arising from contract claims which
are being resolved, and consultancy fees.
V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.01      The appraisal of Loan 2273-BEL included analysis of:  (i) the road
rehabilitation and drainage improvements; and (ii) the road maintenance
program. However, as noted in the appraisal report, an overlapping of project
benefits is inevitable. What follows is a discussion of the economic
reevaluation of the elements of road rehabili:ation and drainage improvement
and the maintenance program.
5.02      The road rehabilitation subprojects were justified at appraisal on
the basis of quantifiable benefits accruing to road users from vehicle
operating cost savings resulting from improved road conditions and avoidance
of future deterioration. The appraisal estimated the following IRR:
San Ignacio - Belmopan Entrance (Sect. A)                      13%
Santa Elena - Corazal (Sect. C)                                24%
Haulover Bridge - Airport Junction (Sect. B)                   12%
Southern Highway Drainage (Sect. Dl, D2 & D3)                  18%



- 13 -
5.03      The economic reevaluation of the road rehabi'litation subprojects was
based upon a methodology similar to the one used in the appraisal. Vehicle
op*a.ating costs were adjusted for different surface conditions with and
without the project and applied to July 1985 traffic counts. In the without
project cas-, it was assumed that the road would deteriorste to the point of
breaking up.  The ex-post evaluation estimated the following In:a
San Ignacio - Belmopan (San Ignacio-Georgeville) (Sect.Al) 9.15X2./
San Ignacio -Belmopan (Roaring Creek-Belsopan) (Sect.A2)  37.29'
Haulover Bridge - Airport Junction (Sect. t)                25.51X
Santa Elena - Corazal (Sect. C)                             47.10S
Southern Highway Drainage (Sect. Dl, D2, D3)                18X
The major difference in the parameters used in the appraisal and the ex-post
evaluation was that the appraisal estimated an average daily traffic (ADT) on
the Haulover Bridge Airport Junction section of about 1,180 vehicles per day
in 1982. Traffic counts carried out by MOW in July 1985 showed a seasonally
adjusted ADT of 1340 vehicles per day (Table 7).
VI. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
6.01      The performance of the Borrower, except in the "a.ea of institution
strengthening, can be considered as generally satisfactory. The poor
implementation of the various elements of the road maintenance program,
particularly the Maintenance Management System and the Cost Accounting System,
considerably reduced the impact of the technical assistance. However, it is
noted that the systems recommended by the maintenance consultants far exceeded
the absorptive capacity of the MOW staff. A more gradual, step-by-step
approach, starting with training in basic maintenance functions, would have
been preferable.
6.02      The following is a discussion of the major covenants included in the
agreement and the Borrower's efforts to comply with them:
Section 3.02. Employ consultants satisfactory to the Bank to:
(i) carry out engineering design, procurement of contractors, and
supervision of civil works; (ii) provide technical assistance for a
Road Maintenance and Training Program; (iii) prepare an export
transportation Master Plan.
Items (i), (ii) and (iii) were complied with after some delay. The
consultant chosen for item (ii) was not completely satisfactory to
the Bank, which would have preferred to use the same consultant in
charge of project supervision. However, Borrower preference was
honored, with the results noted.
2/
The contract for Section A, San Ignacio to Belmopan Entrance includes two
separate links as follows: (1) San Iganacio to Georgeville (5.63 miles)
on the Western Highway and (2) Belmopan to Roaring Creek (7.24 miles) on
the Huzmmingbird Highway. Traffic and vehicle operating costs are very
different for these two links and therefore the IRR was calculated for
each link.

Section 3.04.: (a) Prior to JanuarY 31. 1984, establish and ooerate
with MOW * Trainint Production Units (bb Provide such unit with
suitable staff, funds, eauivmnt and materials to Perform
maintenance overations. Compliod with on tie, but overall affect
was diluted due to the necessity to use the aTPU as a force account
unit in construction, rather than a training unit in maintenane.
Section 4,05. Not later than June 30. 1984. carry out a study on
current vehicle axlo-load. witeh rcoieo dation on advisability of
establiabint axle-load limits. The study was completed in Novmeber
1985 by the supervising consultant. Their conclusion was that.while
the situation should be reviuewd from time to time, there is at
present no justification for the establishment of expensive
enforcement measures to limit axle-loads in Belise.
Section 4.06 (a) Not later than January 31. 1985. adopt budgetary
nd accountinz yrocedur*s sesaratina maintenance bud2ets and
accounts from other MOW activities. Complied with on time, but MOW
lacks the resoureos, technical and managerial staff necessary to

VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      The Road mainteniance and Rehabilitation Project was successful in
the implementation of its civil works components, despite the necessity to
reduce the drainage improvements o& Section D3 of the Southern Highway from -.
miles to 18 miles.  The equipment purchased under the project helped carry o:-
maintenance of the road network and implementation of the district RTPUs.
Thanks to the road maintenance program, some operational improvements were
achieved both in the management of the MOW central workshop, and in the
technical service sector. The management system provided by the maintenance
consultants was implemented in all MOW districts but is not working, through
lack of staff capable of running a sophisticated system. Additional effort
will be nveessary to strengthen improvements achieved to date.
7.02      The major lessons associated with this project relate to the
necessary preconditions for the successful completion of civil works and the
effective delivery of technical assistance for institution strengthening.
Furthermore, there is the need by the Bank to make full use of this first
experience in Belize for the success of future projects.

7.03      The report identifies the following lessons to be learned from the
project. Many of the problems were a result of the Borrower's lack of
exporience with World Bank loans 3  and should not carry over to the proposed
second loan.
(a) Durig the preparation of technical laslstance with an lintitution
streogthbning component, the Bank should carefully "asee the
absorptive capacity of the reciplet instltution. Bells-'c
institutional constraints were the lack of qualified staff, and a
'                       weak anagement.4   As a result, MOW was Ill-prepared to take full
advantage of a sophisticated lnformtion systm  such as the one
provided by tho consultants;
(b) the Bank should pay special attention to the development of
reporting requirements to monitor project implementation;
(c) the SAR should have allowed for the limitations of the contracting
Industry in Belize which lacked sufficient rosources to participate
in this project without first beino given technical and financial
assistance. There were shortages in all areas; the firms were
under-capitalized; management, professional staff, technicians,
equipment operators, and skilled and unskilled laborers were in
short supply or simply not available; maintenance equipment and
matetials were not always available. As a result of -this, it war
necessary for the project supervision consultants to increase their
participation in the training and technical assistance areas of the
project. This they carried out in a competent, down-to-earth
manner, leaving behind a much improved road construction industry.
(d) Considerable savings can be effected if locally available materials
are used to the fullest extent. While crushed materials proved
expensive (requiring haulage from 150 km), the consultant designed
an alternative base of cement-stabilized marl which saved about
$17,000 per km of road.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT REVIEWED BY THE MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING AND
ACKNOWLEDGED AS A FAIR AND USEFUL EVALUATION OF PROJECT.
WOULD APPRECIATE RECEIVING ELABORATION ON COSIENTS RAISED IN SECTION VII OF
REPORT-CONCLUSIONS P.P. 14 AND 15 OF THE REPORT.
(I)      THAT MANY OF THE PROBLEMS WERE A RESULT OF THE BORROWER'S LACK OF
OF EXPERIENCE WITH WORLD BANK LOANS.
(II)     THAT, "BELIZE'S INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS WERE A LACK OF
QUALIFIED STAFF AND A WEAK MANAGEMENT"
INFORMATION CONSIDERED IMPORTANT TO ENSURING IMPROVED BORROWER PERFORMANCES
UNDER PROPOSED SECOND LOAN.

2.       IBRD's Complementary Comments
MOW management was understaffed to carry out adequate monitoring of the
project. This was the first Bank project in Belize and the Ministry
evidently underestimated the demand the project would place on the time of
MOW personnel. MOW staff was short of qualified engineers and technicians,
and staff were often required to perform duties other-than-those to which
they had normally been assigned. This practice has also affected the
efficacy of the training organized under the project for MOW counterparts
and district maintenance personnel.
Time constraints also precluded MOW management to adequately monitor
progress and the quality achieved in training conducted by technical
assistance consultants. The training would have produced better results if
management would have had direct oversight of training activities, and had
demonstrated to MOW participants its interest in training. The lack of
adequate feedback from management on the results of training was
detrimental to the maintenance training program.
Major institutional constraints were (i) the weakness of the local
construction industry, due to limited administrative, technical and
