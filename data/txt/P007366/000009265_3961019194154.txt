THIRD INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT LOAN 2703-HO
Preface
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Honduras Third
Industrial Project (Loan 2703-HO) in the amount of US$37.4 million equivalent. It was
approved May 29, 1986 and became effective July 7, 1986. The Loan closed June 30,
1995, two and one-half years later than the expected closing date of December 31,
1992. In total, US$33.4 million was disbursed against the Loan.
2.    The Implementation Completion Report was prepared by Juan Luis Moreno V.,
consultant, and reviewed by Robert Lacey, Division Chief, Public Sector
Modernization and Private Sector Development Division, Country Department II, Latin
America and the Caribbean Region.
3.    Preparation of this ICR was based on the findings of field visits to Honduras,
interviews with government officials and Bank staff involved in the project, and review
of project files. The Borrower received the draft for comments and prepared its own
evaluation of the project, which is attached, and it also accepted the ICR.

THIRD INDUSTRIAL PROJECT
LOAN 2703-HO
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction and Project Objectives
i.       During the early 1980s Honduras' manufacturing sector suffered a series of
setbacks. The collapse of the Central American Common Market (CACM) and
devaluation of other regional currencies led to a loss of competitiveness, with
manufactured exports dropping by nearly one-third between 1980 and 1982. In view
of the situation, the Government's plan for the industrial sector was to expand
production, particularly to countries outside the region. A change in industrial
incentives to reduce protection was a first step; however, investment for
modernization and restructuring of industrial facilities was also needed to improve
competitiveness. (para. 2)
ii.     In the past investment in the industrial sector was seriously constrained by
inadequate term credit. Only 15% of private sector bank loans had maturities over 5
years--usually to preferred clients (large firms). Furthermore, assets were highly
concentrated in four banks. This had the effect of restricting long-term credit for
medium or small firms. The National Industrial Development Fund (FONDEI)
remained the only source of long-term financing for medium-scale or small firms. Its
line of credit was in part financed by two previous Bank Loans and helped fill the
term credit gap. (para. 3)
Project Objectives
iii.    The original project size was US$37.4 million. The project objectives were:
(a) to support industrial private investment through the provision of term credit for
medium-scale and small firms; (b) to improve performance of the financial sector
through technical assistance to undertake appraisal and supervision of investment
projects, and to strengthen the monitoring functions of the Superintendency of
Banks; (c) to carry out industrial sector-specific studies, improving the database and
analysis of key issues affecting sector development; and (d) to strengthen FONDEI's
institutional capacity. Later, the loan was amended, with US$2 million directed to
balance of payments support, and US$2 million for technical assistance to the
Central Bank to establish a modem information system.



iii
Implementation Experience and Result
iv.      Loans were made in Lempiras at a fixed rate of interest while the BCH
assumed the exchange risk. The Bank tried, unsuccessfully, to introduce flexible
interest rates or dollar denominated loans. The project was a multi-currency loan;
other repayment of interest and amortization to the World Bank were calculated using
a basket of currencies. The devaluation of the dollar caused losses to the Central
Bank and led to an implicit subsidy to borrowers. Under these conditions, the
Government of Honduras decided to suspend the use of the industrial credit,
negotiating a transfer of US$20 million for use as balance of payments support, as
well as additional funds for technical assistance to modernize the Central Bank's
information technology systems. Nevertheless, US$22.7 million eventually was lent
under the program. Of this amount, US$10.4 million was financed by the Bank for 67
industrial investment projects in medium-scale and small firms. This led to the
creation of 532 jobs. (para. 8)
v.       The technical assistance to Central Bank (BCH) was delayed 5 months
when one firm filed a legal objection to the award which the courts eventually
rejected. (Subsequently, procurement followed the Bank's two-stage bidding process
without difficulties.) In addition, project implementation also was delayed by internal
management problems related to jurisdiction over the project. The program required a
complete change in administrative procedures, which took one year and strong
support from management to complete. Actions taken to improve the administration
included the appointment of a new division director and contracting an external
consultant to develop an administrative strategy to implement the restructuring. (para.
9, 16)
vi.      The project was successful in realizing its institutional development and
technical assistance objectives. Operating capacity of private financial institutions
was developed to evaluate, appraise, and supervise investment projects. In this
regard, five banks created "project sections" to evaluate investment loans. (para. 12)
In addition, the project improved the monitoring ability of the Superintendency of
Banks and strengthened FONDEI institutionally. The project also updated the central
bank system's environment by replacing obsolete computer technology and
modernizing its information system. (para. 16)
vii.    No future operations are contemplated at this time. Long-term industrial
investment lending by FONDEI has continued using funds from repayments of loans
supported by the present and previous World Bank credit. Nevertheless, the effective
sustainability of the credit line is below expectations because of the large devaluation
of the Lempira in 1991, and high inflation has decreased the real value of the
repayment funds, given that interest rates did not reflect the inflationary environment.



iv
viii.    In summary lessons from the loan experience are that for an industrial
credit project, careful attention should be paid to devaluation risks and effective
onlending rates. The issue of flexible interest rates or dollar-denominated loans should
have been decided prior to the loan agreement.

HONDURAS
THIRD INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
LOAN 2703-HO
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
Background
1.       At the time of the loan, Honduras' manufacturing sector was relatively
undeveloped, accounting for about 13 percent of GDP, less than 15 percent of total
exports, and employing less than 8 percent of the economically active population. Import-
substitution policies were in place, though not as aggressively as in other countries in
Central America. As a result, Honduran manufacturing was relatively efficient, with most
industries producing at or near international prices.
2.       The manufacturing sector grew at an average annual rate of nearly 9 percent in
the second half of the 1970s, as a result of the rapid expansion of the Central American
Common Market (CACM). This trend was brought to an abrupt halt in the early 1980s,
when the world recession triggered a sharp contraction in the domestic and regional
markets for manufactured goods. Devaluation of other regional currencies led to loss of
competitiveness of exportable manufactures in regional markets. Overall, manufactured
exports dropped by nearly one-third in current terms between 1980 and 1982. In view of
the new situation, the Government's objective for the industrial sector was to expand
production, particularly to third countries, since prospects for growth within the CACM
were limited at the time. A change in industrial incentive, reducing protection, was a first
step in this direction.
3.       The Government and the Bank's strategy was geared to support private
investment in export industries and industries producing efficiently for local markets.
Production for third markets required substantial investment in the retooling and
upgrading of existing plants, construction of new plants, and considerable marketing
efforts. One factor limiting investment in the industrial sector was a dearth of term credit.
Only 15% of private sector bank loans had maturities over 5 years -- usually to preferred
clients (large firms). Furthermore, banks assets were highly concentrated within four
banks; thus, long term credit for medium or small firms was not available.
4.       The National Industrial Development Fund (FONDEI) represented 80 percent
of term credit for industrial investment, It was the only source of long-term financing for
medium-scale or small firms, and its line of credit was financed by previous Bank loans
(Loan 1659-HO in 1979 and Loan 2075-HO in 1982). Its function was financed to fill the



2
need for both term credit and foreign exchange. FONDEI, a second-tier institution, and a
semiautonomous department of the Banco Central de Honduras (BCH), had previously
managed the two World Bank industrial credit projects to Honduras, and had now
developed into a mature and relatively efficient institution. The principal lessons derived
from the first two projects were: (a) financial intermediaries should assume greater
responsibility for appraising and supervising subprojects; and (b) a program of technical
assistance would help to strengthen the capabilities of private commercial banks, as well as
those of public institutions in the sector.
Achievement of Objectives
5.       The original lending objectives were only partially fulfilled, as the credit
program was eventually canceled after US$10.4 million had been disbursed, and over
US$20.0 million transferred to be used for balance of payments support (which became a
high priority), and also for technical assistance to the BCH. The industrial loans made
under the program were in line with the World Bank's objectives relative to firm size,
participation of private banks, targeting of industrial sectors, and geographic dispersion.
6.       Fulfillment of project institutional development objectives and technical
assistance was highly satisfactory, especially in the design and implementation aspects.
The project developed the operating capacity of private financial institutions: five banks
established their own project operating units. In addition, the project strengthened
FONDEI's and the Superintendency of Bank's institutional capacity, and modernized
BCH's obsolete computer facility and systems. However, the studies component objective
was not fulfilled, as several studies were incomplete, were done with a reduced scope, or
their recommendations could not be implemented.
Project Implementation and Major Factors Affecting the Project
7.       One problem with the project was the fixed interest rate in Lempiras, which
meant that the Central Bank assumed the exchange risk. This was not considered a
problem as long as the Lempira remained stable. The Bank tried, unsuccessfully, to
introduce flexible interest rates or dollar denominated loans during preparation. The
project was a multi-currency loan, and repayments of interest and amortization to the
World Bank were calculated using a basket of currencies. The depreciation of the dollar
during 1986-87 produced an exchange cost and, implicitly, a transfer to borrowers (this
later on became larger as the Lempira was devalued). Under these conditions the
Government of Honduras suspended the use of the industrial credit and negotiated a
transfer of the remaining US$20 million to be used as balance of payments support.
Additionally, US$2.3 million was canceled, and US$1.7 million remained undisbursed.
Nevertheless, US$22.7 million was lent under the program for 67 industrial investment
projects in medium-scale and small firms, leading to the creation of 532 jobs.
8.       The procurement of BCH's computer was done using procurement procedures
following Honduran laws. This was accepted by the Bank, as originally BCH was not sure
I



3
ICB procedures could be used. This proved to be unfounded. One of the firms involved
objected to the result of the bidding and challenged it in court. This led to a 5-month
delay in project implementation (the court ultimately rejected the complaint).
Subsequently, procurement followed the Bank's two-stage bidding process.
Credit Component
9.       The Credit component contemplated subloans of US$52.7 million, including
US$16.9 million from FONDEI and Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs). During
1987/88 and part of 1989, before loans from the industrial credit component were
suspended, lending was above the projected timetable for use of resources. The program
financed 67 projects for US$22.7 million, of which US$10.4 million came from the Bank
credit. The operations financed were mainly for medium-scale firms, with US$1.6 million
going to small-scale and micro firms. Of the total, 71% was used for investment in fixed
assets and 29% for working capital. The principal beneficiaries were the food and
beverage industry, the chemical industry, and the machinery industry. The projects
financed showed an internal financial and economic rate of return of between 20% and
25%.
Technical Assistance Component
10.      The Technical Assistance component was the most successful part of the
program, with the number of participants trained exceeding expectations. The program
was coordinated by a consultant. FONDEI created a Unidad de Asistencia Tecnica
(Technical Assistance Unit) to coordinate the various projects. The subcomponents and
implementation results are described below.
11.      Training courses and seminars were given to employees of financial
intermediaries as well as FONDEI's employees and consultants in project evaluation,
appraisal, and supervision. Also, procedures and norms were developed with which to
analyze and evaluate loans. As a result, five private banks were able to create a
"development unit" or project section, with their personnel trained to evaluate investment
loans, which both accelerated loan processing and made it more efficient.
12.      FONDEI bought modem computer equipment, information processing
technology, a computer package for project evaluation, and received the requisite training.
Additionally, support was given to FONDEI to strengthen its operational capacity and
improve its physical installations. The project also strengthened the capacity of the
Superintendency of Banks to supervise commercial banr s by providing courses on project
evaluation and training (both abroad and locally) in credit control and bank supervision.
13.      The studies component was not as successful (see table 7). The study on
imports' Temporary Admission Regime (TAR) was not done, and the study on constraints
on investment was of very limited scope. The proposals to establish variable interest rates
could not be implemented because of the Central Bank's domestic legal constraints. The



4
project also supported an industrial survey. The studies on customs duties and allocation
of foreign exchange were done using government resources.
Modernization of Central Bank Computer System
14.      The information system used by BCH was obsolete. The objective of the
modernization process was: (a) to buy new open-architecture hardware and compatible
software; (b) to develop and implement new software applications (e.g., accounting and
personnel) in an integrated systems environment; (c) to train computer and central bank
personnel in the new technology; and (d) to promote the widespread use of
microcomputers.
15.      Project implementation was delayed five months because of procurement
procedural problems. In addition, there were implementation problems related to
jurisdiction over the project. The program required a complete change in administrative
procedures. With strong support from management, the problems were resolved after one
year. The actions taken included the appointment of a new division director and
contracting an external consultant to develop an administrative strategy to implement the
restructuring.
16.      Training for the new system was carried out successfully. Training was given
by equipment and program suppliers, through external academic courses, training abroad,
and "leaming-by-doing." The program implemented an open-architecture, integrated
system design; installed and began to operate a UNIX software package; implemented a
relational data base and an Executive Information System; and installed 100
microcomputers. New applications were developed for a number of administrative and
operational functions, including accounting, foreign exchange management, personnel, and
budget. The project, in spite of its delays, was in large part completed in a satisfactory
manner. The most important operational result was the integration of the different
branches and activities of the BCH by end 1985.
Project Sustainability
17.      Long term industrial investment lending by FONDEI has continued, using
funds from repayments of loans. FONDEI was later reorganized as FONDEPRO to be
able to absorb Central Bank's industrial credit line. Nevertheless, the effective
sustainability of the credit line is uncertain because of the large devaluation of the Lempira
in 1991; moreover, high inflation has decreased the real value of the repayment funds,
since interest rates were kept constant. In spite of this, the strengthened institutional
capacity of the PFIs and FONDEI developed under the project has been instrumental to
the maintenance of the long-term lending facility.

Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
18.      The lending program had limited success as less than one-third of the project
funds were actually used for industrial credit and as the effective income transfer to
industry reduced the social benefits of the project. However, the use of the remaining
funds for balance-of-payments support was socially beneficial. At the same time, the
project did succeed in developing institutional capacity in the private and public sector,
including the modernization of the information system of BCH, despite the fact that the
studies component objective was not fulfilled. Some studies were not completed or those
that were had little impact on the project's results.
Bank Performance
20.      The Bank's performance in the identification and preparation of the
loan was satisfactory. A new concept of project management, with the
participation of PFIs, proved successful, as was the improved capacity and
training in all institutions involved. The World Bank was correct in identifying the
issue of exchange risk, and considered solutions in terms of flexible rates or dollar
loans. The Bank's performance at appraisal was not satisfactory because the
exchange risk, or flexible interest rate issue, should have been resolved before
approval rather than considering it after effectiveness. The Bank's supervision was
acceptable. It responded to shifts in government priorities by redirecting available
funds, and demonstrated needed flexibility in this regard.
Borrower Performance
21.      BCH was cooperative and proficient in project preparation, design,
implementation, and evaluation. The competency and integrity of FONDEI and of BCH
ensured public acceptance of the program and contributed to its effectiveness.
22.      The decision to suspend lending was necessary to avoid taking additional
exchange risks and to reduce potential subsidies to borrowers. The development of
technical assistance for the private sector to establish "development units" or project
sections was well done. Additionally, in the process FONDEI became an experienced,
well-trained, well-equipped, and well-managed institution.
Lessons Learned
23.      A broad lesson from the loan experience is that for this kind of project, careful
attention should be paid to the devaluation risks and the effective onlending rates. The
issue of flexible interest or dollar denominated loans should have been resolved prior to
the loan agreement. An implementation lesson specific to the project is that the Bank
should have insisted on using international procurement procedures for the added BCH
computer project.

PROGRAM REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
FOREWORD
1.   This is the Implementation Compliance Report (ICR) for the Third Industrial Credit
Loan Project, Loan NO 2703-HO, in the amount of L. 74.8 million, equivalent to US$37.4
milion, which was approved on May 29, 1986, and was effective on July 7, 1986. This
report is in compliance with Article IX, Section 9.07, literal c) of the Loan Agreement.
2.    Loan 2703-HO disbursements were suspended due to the high exchange risk in the
World Bank's basket of currencies. The last disbursement for investment projects through
the PFIs was made on May 24, 1988, when the loan balance was L. 66.2 million,
equivalent to US$33.1 million. Some of the unused investment project resources
(US$20.0 million) were reassigned to support the balance of payments, and some
(US$2.0 million) to the Central Bank Restructuring Program. The last disbursement made
after these reassignments was on November 14, 1994. Sixty seven investment projects of
mo-, small and medium-sized industrial enterprises were funded with Loan 2703-HO
resources, in the amounts of L. 21.7 million World Bank resources, and L. 7.2 million
BCH/FONDEPRO resources. Project co-financing was provided through counterpart funds
from the Central Bank of Honduras, Financial Intermediaries and subborrowers internal
resources.
3.   The ICR was prepared by BCH/FONDEPRO personnel during the month of March,
prior to the arrival of the World Bank's Appraisal Mission.  The Loan Agreement,
amendments to the Loan, and to the Subsidiary Loan Contract, the white paper for the
negotiation of Loan NO 2703-HO, the technical assistance program, FONDEPRO progress
reports and the files for subloans granted were reviewed in order to prepare the ICR. This
report was prepared following the guidelines provided to the BCH/FONDEPRO by World
Bank representatives in November 1994.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLIANCE REPORT
THIRD INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
(LOAN NO 2703-HO)
APPRAISAL SUMMARY
1. The Third Industrial Credit Loan Project, for which the disbursement period was March
24, 1986 through November 14, 1994, was the last of four loans granted by the World
Bank, for the Honduran Industrial and Tourism Sector. The Four Loans amount to
US$101.9 million, and are administrated by the Central Bank of Honduras, through the
Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Industrial (FONDEI), now renamed Fondo de Credito para el
Desarrollo de la Producci6n (FONDEPRO), established through the unification of the
Unidad de Cr6dito Agropecuario and the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Industrial, by the
Central Bank's Board of Directors Decision No. 283-6/93, dated June 24, 1993.
2. The Third Industrial Credit Loan Project, Loan NO 2703-HO, in the amount of US$37.4
million, contemplated the following objectives: a) to promote industrial enterprises in
Honduras, mostly small and medium-sized industries; b) to provide an improved credit flow
to industrial enterprises; c) to improve the institutional conditions and capabilities of the
financial sector; d) to strengthen the institutional capabilities of FONDEI and the BCH; e) to
promote improved procedures and overview of the subloans by the FIs working with the
FONDEI; f) to assess the industrial sector, including the generation of sectoral data to
assist in the enforcement of Sectoral Policies Reforms.
3. The Project design included offering credit to investment enterprises, in the areas of
Fixed Assets combined with Working Capital, Working Capital by itself, and for the
development of new techniques and implementation of existing new production techniques;
as well as a technical assistance program for the BCH, FONDEI, CDI and Financial
Intermediaries.
4. In view of the high cost of resources used to finance, due to the use of the World Bank's
basket of currencies and the high exchange risk, on December 10, 1987, the Government
and the BCH decided to postpone temporarily the use of loan resources, until April 30,
1988. During the analysis of alternatives and negotiations with the IBRD, a decision was
made to reassign the unused loan balance, introducing the following revisions to the Loan
Agreement: a) US$20.0 million were transferred to the Government in April 1988, in
support of the balance of payments, and b) US$2.0 million were reassigned to the BCH's
informatics restructuring program, in June 1992. In addition to the above mentioned
changes, on June 26, 1992, the Government had sent a cancellation notice in the amount
of US$2.3 million to the IBRD. A balance of approximately US$1.9 million is estimated to



21
remain unused upon completion of the BCH's informatics program, and the use of same
will have to be cancelled.
5. When evaluating project results, on the basis of the implementation indicators
established for the period 1986-1989, the following comments apply: a) To grant and
disburse a 100 per cent of the financial resources: as of November 1994, 85 per cent of
same had been committed and disbursed; b) To grant 402 subloans: 67 (17 %) were
granted; c) To generate 6,082 employments: an estimated 532 (9 %) were generated; d)
Establishing 11 development units at the Financial Intermediaries: 5 units were established;
e) Training 110 persons at FONDEI, BCH, and Financial Intermediaries: 202 persons
were trained.
6. The technical assistance program was executed with financial resources from the
World Bank, UNDP, and BCH/FONDE Counterpart funds. Part of this funds were used to
acquire hardware and software required to computerize FONDEI's accounting. Similar
support was provided to the Centro de Desarrollo Industrial (CDI), the major non-banking
financial intermediary, aimed at providing technical and financial assistance to micro- and
small entrepreneurs, which channelled up to L. 100,000 in project funds per subborrower.
The institution ceased to exist, by governmental decision, and in compliance with National
Congress Decree N013-92, of April 8, 1992.
7. Since the use of funds was postponed, and in order to continue providing financing to
micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, through Resolution N0620-12/87, dated
December 17, 1987, the Board of Directors of the BCH established the Local Currency
Financing Line, constituted with funds recovered from credits granted under Agreements
1659-HO, 2075-HO, and 2703-HO.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLIANCE REPORT
THIRD INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
(LOAN N° 2703-HO)
Prolect Obiectives and Description:
The Loan Agreement in the amount of US$37.4 million, entered upon by the
Republic of Honduras and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, was
signed on July 7, 1986. Prior to this Projec (1659-HO, 2075-HO), the World Bank had
provided three loans: two industrial loans), and another one for the development of Tourism
in Honduras (1673-HO). The World Bank has granted the Government of Honduras a total
of four loans amounting to US$101.9 million, channelled by the Banco Central de
Honduras through the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Industrial (FONDEI), now renamed
Fondo de Credito para el Desarrollo de la Producci6n (FONDEPRO).
The main objectives of Project 2703-HO were:
a.   To promote industrial enterprises in Honduras, emphasizing on the develop-
ment of small and medium-sized industries.
b.   To provide industrial enterprises with an improved credit flow.
c.    To improve the conditions and institutional capabilities of the financial sector.
d.   To strengthen FONDEI's and BCH's institutional capabilities.
e.   To promote improved procedures and overview of subloans by the Financial
Intermediaries cooperating with FONDEI.
f.    To analyze the industrial sector, including the generation of sectoral data to
assist in the enforcement of sectoral policies reforms.
The objectives envisaged in the Third Industrial Loan Project are similar to those
established for the Second Industrial Loan Project, approved on December 22, 1981,
although support to the Technical Assistance Program is enhanced within the Third Project
which emphasizes on Institutional Development of the Central Bank, FONDEI, and
Financial Intermediaries. The above outlined objectives are considered to be precise, well
grounded and feasible.



23
Objectives Execution:
According to the chronogram for execution of the Project, its closing date was
foreseen for December 31, 1992. Due to several reasons the closing date has been
extended to June 30, 1995 (Table No.3').
The disbursements program began on March 31, 1987 and was to conclude on
December 31, 1993. In view of the loan postponement enacted by the Government and the
Central Bank's Board of Directors, due to the financial cost increment upon application of
the cost of the World Bank's basket of currencies, and the currency exchange risk, the use
of resource was not implemented as programmed, causing two revisions to the Loan
Agreement, and more particularly to "Annex I, Withdrawal of the Amount of the Loan";
one in April 1988, to reassign US$20.0 million, of funds designated for the subloans item,
to assist the balance of payment, in support of the initial phases of the macroeconomic
adjustment program the Government was beginning to implement that year. Another
revision took effect in June 1992, which allowed for the reassignment of US$2.0 million, to
support the Central Bank's restructuring program, mostly in the areas of: i) installation of an
informatics administration system at the BCH; ii) assessment of the scope of the
reorganization, and adequation of its functions; iii) institutional relationship of the BCH with
the rest of the public sector, and strengthening its autonomous operation.
In addition to the above changes, on June 26, 1992, the Government informed the
cancellation of US$2.3 million. According to estimates, after implementation of the Central
Bank's Informatics Restructuring Program is completed, there will be a balance of US$1.9
million, for which cancellation notice will have to be given to the World Bank. Several prob-
lems have arisen during the computer equipment purchasing process undergone by the
BCH's Department of Informatics and Technology. An analysis is being made of the offers
presented during the Public Bid held in January 1995.
According to project implementation indicators 100 per cent of the available
resources should have been granted during the period 1986-1989; only 85 per cent had
been granted and disbursed as of November 1994, including a disbursement in the amount
of US$20.0 million for the balance of payments.
Financing was to be provided for 402 subloans, out of which 67, representing 17 per
cent, were actually financed; 6,082 new employment opportunities were to be generated,
and according to estimates 532, representing 9 per cent, were attained. If reassignment of
the above mentioned Lps. 20.0 had nct been made, it would have been possible to attain
those objectives.
' Tables 3 and 7 are included in the Bank's reports, thables 14 and 21 are in the original spanish version of the
Implementation Report by the BCH.



24
Results may be considered satisfactory in the area of institutional development
objectives. Eleven Development Units were to be established by the end of 1989, within
the administrative structure of the Financial Intermediaries, in order for them to negotiate,
evaluate and overview investment proje_S. Five of these units, for an equivalent 45 per
cent of the target, were established in the same number of Financial Intermediaries. Also, a
set of Credit Autonomy Regulations was prepared, which was approved by the Board of
Directors of the Central Bank of Honduras, by way of Resolution No. 299-6187, of June
25, 1987. This enabled PFIs with established Development Units to independently
approve loans for up to Lps. 100,000.00, thus expediting subloan approval and
disbursement procedures. Accordingly, and although the Development Units are no longer
working as expected, 11 PFIs are currently authorized to provide loans for up to L.
200,000.00.
The Enterprises Rehabilitation By-law was prepared with a Consultant's technical
assistance, which was approved by Resolution 548-11187 of the Board of Directors of the
Central Bank of Honduras, on November 5, 1987. This by-law takes into account different
financing forms to those enterprises which, due to special circumstances, fell in arrears or
lack of liquidity. This system has benefited several enterprises.
It was programmed to train 110 people. Over 200 employees of the Central
Reserve Bank, FONDEI, Financial Intermediaries and Consultants were trained. The
Technical Assistance Program was executed with financial support of World Bank, UNDP
and FONDEI counterpart funds.  In addition, computer equipment and the required
software was acquired through this Program. Aiso, the Centro de Desarrollo Industrial
(C.D.I.) benefited. The C.D.I. is the main financial intermediary providing technical and
financial assistance to the micro- and small entrepreneur, with a maximum of
Lps.100,000.00 Project financing per borrower.
Main Problems Affectinc the Proiect
The main problem affecting Project execution was the cost of the currency basket
used by the World Bank for loan payment of principal and interest, which led the
Government, as borrower, and the Central Bank of Honduras, as executing agency, to
temporarily suspend the use of Project funds.
After an evaluation and the due negotiations, it was determined to reassign US$20.0
million for the Balance of Payments, as stated in literal C), Annex I of the modified Loan
Agreement. Also, US$2.0 million were reassigned for the Central Bank of Honduras to
execute of the Information Reform Program, through the Department of Information and
Technology. This component has had implementation delays due to several difficulties,
specially in the computer equipment bidding process. In addition to the financial cost



25
increase due to the Currency Basket, there is an exchange risk. Both problems prevented
the continued granting of subloans to the private enterprise. The Loan Agreement stated
that financing could be granted in US dollars with loan repayments in the same currency.
Legal restrictions did not permit such a practice.
Proiect Sustainability
Although only part of Loan 2703-HO was used for industrial credit and technical
assistance, it is considered that it has contributed to the sustainability of the main objectives
of the Project. Since the use of financial resources for the Third Industrial Credit Project
was suspended, and in order to keep providing medium and long term loans to micro-,
small and medium sized enterprises, the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Hon-
duras, by Resolution 620-12187, created the NATIONAL CURRENCY INDUSTRIAL
FINANCING LINE, established with funds recovered from credits granted through Agree-
ments 1659-HO, 2075-HO and 2703-HO.
Before the creation of this line, the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of
Honduras, by Resolution 1956-12/84, created the FINANCING LINE FOR HOTELS AND
RELATED ACTIVITIES, established with funds recovered from credits granted through
Agreement 1673-HO. Both financing lines are currently available.
As can be seen, the Project sustainability during the last 7 years has been made
possible through financing granted with resources recovered from previously granted loans.
FONDEI's (FONDEPRO) activities were enhanced in December 1988, with AID's Project
No.522-0241 Small Enterprise II (FOPEME), in the amount of Lps. 30.0 million, of which
Lps. 28.0 million were assigned to the Loan Fund, and Lps. 2.0 million to the Guarantee
Fund, which was highly successful (Non-refundable resources). Also, the Industrial
Financing Lines managed by the Programa de Reactivaci6n Industrial (PRI), an agency of
the Banco Central de Honduras, including the Financing Lines provided by the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI), IDB, Venezuela Export Fund
(FINEXPO), C.C.C. and Spanish-Honduran Equipment Support Fund, the latter non-
refundable resources, were transferred to FONDEI (FONDEPRO) in October 1991.
According to the above, and as a part of the Central Bank of Honduras
restructuring process, in June 1993, the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Industrial (FONDEI)
was merged with the Agricultural Credit Project Unit (UPCA), with personnel reduction so
sharp that the unit currently has only 37 employees, including that of two regional offices in
San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba. This has allowed for significant operating costs reductions.



26
Performance of the Bank
The World Bank's performance during the preparation, assessment and overview
stages of the project was satisfactory.
During the preparation and implementation stages of the Project, a
Consultant provided assistance with contributed to carry out the corresponding activities.
Nevertheless, no analysis in depth was made of the possible changes in the currency
basket. Also, the World Bank's officials have always been willing to help in the analysis
and search for altematives to solve any problems found during the execution of the different
stages of the Project.
These solutions have been carried out within regulations and in the shortest
possible period, such as revisions to the Loan Agreement, which allowed to reassign
financial resources to cover areas that could be served within the terms of the Agreement.
Performance of the Borrower
During the stages of Loan negotiation and design, the Government and the BCH, as
Executing Unit, cooperated with the World Bank in the preparation of the financial and
statistical data required to execute the Loan Agreement.
Existing legal restrictions on dollar loan granting were not taken into account when
drafting the Project. Therefore, the financing mode by which loans in dollars would have
been granted, to be repaid in the same currency, thus reducing the currency exchange risk,
was not promoted.
The decision to suspend the use of loan funds to provide financing to the Private
Sector through the Financial Intermediaries was a fit one, as it prevented to continue
subsidizing it, due to the effects of the currency basket and the currency exchange risk on
the financial cost. Negotiations were carried out and amendments were made to the Loan
Agreement to reassign funds at the shortest possible time, thus allowing the Govemment to
continue using loan funds for the balance of payments and to strengthen the BCH
Informatics program. On the other part, there was a better coordination among the
institutions involved was during the execution of the Technical Assistance Program, thus
helping attain satisfactory results.
The modality of performing diagnostics of the Financial Intermediaries set up
by the technical assistance component of the Third Industrial Loan Project, in order for the
former to establish Development Units within their organizational structure, as a requisite to
set their autonomous approval limitations was satisfactory, as some of the Banks were
willing to establish them. In addition to financing granted through financing lines provided
by FONDEPRO, these Units or Credit Sections carried out operations with their own



27
resources, helping to expedite credit granting procedures, and providing for better
coordination with FONDEPRO's Supervision Section in loans follow up.
Results Assessment
The first disbursement of the loan was made on March 21, 1987, continuing to serve
the industrial sector with financing channelled through the Central Bank, FONDEI
(FONDEPRO) and the participating Financial Intermediaries for Micro-, Small and Medium
Sized Industries, with the following results:
a.    Sixty seven investment projects of the Micro-, Small and Medium Sized
Industrial Enterprise were financed, for a total amount of Lps. 28.9 million, out of
which Lps. 21.7 million were World Bank resources, and Lps. 7.2 million were
Central Bank/FONDEI resources, (Table No. H-2). These investment projects are
estimated to have generated 532 new employments.
b.    Out of this financing, 89 per cent, equivalent to Lps.25.7 million, was oriented
to medium sized enterprises, and the remainder Lps.3.2 million were oriented to
micro- and small enterprises (Table No. H-2). Enterprises with net fixed assets
above Lps. 400,000.00, excluding land and buildings, are considered to be medium
sized.
c.    Resources assigned by line item were Lps. 20.5 million for Fixed Assets, and
Lps. 8.4 million for Working Capital, equivalent to 71 per cent and 29 per cent of
total financing, respectively (Table No. H-3).
d.    The participating Financial Intermediaries channelling most of the financial
resources were Banco Continental (22%), BANCAHSA (18 per cent), and Banco de
los Trabajadores (16%), (Table No. H-5).
e.    The industrial activities which took greater advantage of financing were:
Metal works, machinery and equipment manufacturing (24 per cent); Food,
beverages and tobacco (16 per cent); and Chemical products, petroleum derivates,
latex, and plastics (13 per cent), (Table No. H-6). Due to their geographical
characteristics, financing was centered in the departments of Francisco Morazan
and Cortes, mainly in the cities of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, with 60 per cent
and 36 per cent, respectively (Table No. 21).
Since February, 1983, the execution of the Technical Assistance Component of the
Second Industrial Credit Loan was coordinated with the assistance of a Consultant. The
Consultant continued to provide assistance with the Third Industrial Credit Loan, until the
Technical Assistance Unit was established, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.



28
This unit, established by Resolution No. 348-7/86 of the Board of Directors of the Central
Bank of Honduras, dated July 7, 1986, was set up within the organizational structure and
under the Board of Directors of FONDEI. The main purpose of this unit was to coordinate
the execution of the Technical Assistance program, including:
a.   Technical assistance to FONDEI and the Financial Intermediaries, to improve
the system administration, and information, procedures, assessment and overview
of the investment projects.
b.    Technical assistance to the C.D.l. to improve support to micro-enterprises.
c.    Technical assistance to the Banks Superintendence Department of the
Central Bank, to strengthen the transaction overview capabilities as well as the
performance of Commercial Banks.
d.   In order for the Central Bank to carry out the following studies: a) On
procedures to set in motion medium and long term credit with variable interest rates;
b) An industrial sector census; c) An analysis of the restrictions existing on
increment of investments; and d) An assessment of the exchange allocation system.
(Table No. 7).
e.    From the Govemment: a) To evalue the temporal adminission regime (TAR)
for imports stablised by Decree No. 37 of December 27, 1984: y b) A complete
report on existent tariffs and a proposal for tariffs reform (Table No. 14)
Table No. 14 shows a summary of the activities executed by the Technical
Assistance Program.
Future Operations
No short term activities have been programmed for industrial financing through the
BCH-FONDEPRO.
Key knowledge acquired
a.   While there were no major exchange risks, there was demand for
these resources on the part of the Industrial Sector, therefore we consider
that the execution of the Project was positive during the period of stability.
b.   Technical assistance for the PFIs to establish Development Units
within their organizational structure. Though they were not established as
profit and cost centers, they allowed to maintain credit officials in charge of



29
FONDEI related matters at the Banks with larger loan portfolios, with FONDEI
funds. These officials did not work exclusively on it, as there has always
been personnel rotation for their positions, as it generally happens over the
whole banking system.
c.    With the execution of this Project, some long term export activities
such as prawn exports were financed, which the banking system does not
finance with its own resources, thus leaming that the banking system has no
long term resources available for the Industrial Sector.
d.   The execution of this loan agreement has shown that an in depth
analysis of the financial cost of these resources, due to the currency basket
and exchange risk, must be carried out during the stages of project
negotiation and design, establishing procedures to allow this cost to be
covered by the participants in financing channelling to the final borrower.
e.   That, unless their value is maintained, providing financing to the
Industrial Sector through loans in dollars, to be legalized in Lempiras, means
significant losses to both the Govemment and the Central Bank, as well as a
subsidy to the final user of financing. A timely decision was reached in this
case, not to continue providing loans under this scheme.

PROLOGO
Este es el Informe de Cumplimlento de Implementaci6n (ICI) pars el
Tercer Proye+tO de Crr4dito Industrial, Pr6stamo 2703-HO por la
cantidad de L. 74.8 Millones, equivalente a US$37.4 Millones, el
cual fu4 aprobado el 29 de mayo de 1986 y efectivo el 7 de julio de
1986.   Este informe es en cumplimiento al Artfculo IX, Secci6n
9. 07, inciso c) del Convenio de Prestamo.
Los desembolsos del Prestamo 2703-HO, para financiar proyectos de
inversi6n fue suspendido, por el alto riesgo cambiario en la
canasta de moneda del Banco Mundial. El ultimo desembolso para
proyectos de inversi6n a traves de los IFP'S, se llevo a cabo el 24
de Mayo 1988, momento en el cual arrojaba un saldo de Lps. 66.2
Millones equivalente a U.S.$. 33.1 Millones.
Los recursos no utilizados en proyectos de inversi6n, parte fueron
reasignados (U.S.$ 20.0 Millones),  para apoyo de la balansa de
pagos    y  otra parte  (Us$2.0 Millones)  para  el programa  de
Reestructuraci6n del Banco Central.   El ultimo desembolso del
prestamo despues de estas reasignaciones se realiz6   el 14 de
Noviembre de 1994.
Con recursoS financieros del Pr4stamo 2703-HO, se financiaron 67
proyectos de inversi6n de la Micro, Pequenfa y Medina Empresa
Industrial, por un monto de Lps.21.7 Millones con recursos del
Banco Mundial y Lps. 7.2 Millones recursos del BCH/FONDEPRO.
El cofinanciamiento del proyecto fue provisto por contraparte tanto
del Banco Central de Honduras, Intermediarios Financieros y
Recursos Propios de los Subprestatarios.
El ICI fue preparado por el personal de BCH/FONDEPRO en el mes de
marz2, previo a la llegada de la Misi6n de Evaluaci6n del Banco
Mundial.
Para la elaboraci6n ICI se revisaron el Convenio de prestamo,
modificaciones del Convenio y del Contrato de Prestamo Subsidiario,
el Documento base para la negociaci6n del 2703-HO, programa de
asistencia tecnica, informes de labores del FONDEPRO y archivos de

INFORtl'E DE CUMP'LITIENTO DE I.MPLF)ENTACION
TERCER PROYECTO DE CRFDITO IDNUSTRIAL
(PRESTAfO 2703-HO)
R,&SMFKN Dn EVALUACION
El Tercer Proyecto de Credito Industrial, cuyo periodo de
desembolsos comprende del 24 de Marzo 1986 al 14 de Noviembre de
1994,   fue el ultimo de cuatro prestamos recibidos del Banco
Mundial, para el Sector Industrial y Turfstico de Honduras.   Los
Cuatro Frestamos ascienden a USS 101.9 Mfllones y son administrados
por el Banco Central de Honduras, a trav4s del Fondo Nacional de
Desarrollo Industrial (FONDEI), hoy Fondo de Crgdito para el
Desarrollo de la Producci6n (FONDEPRO), constituido mediante la
unificaci6n de la Unidad de Credito Agropecuario y Fondo Nacional
de Desarrollo Industrial, mediante Resoluci6n del Directorio del
Banco Central No.283-6/93, de fecha 24 de Junio de 1993.
El Tercer Proyecto de Credito Industrial (Pr6stamo 2703-HO) por US$
37.4 Millones, contemplaba los objetivos siguientes: a) Fomentar
las empresas industriales en Honduras principalmente la empresa
peguei3a y mediana; b) Proporcionar un mejor flujo de credito a las
empresas  industriales;  c)  Mejorar  la  situaci6n  y  capacidad
institucional del sector financiero; d) Fortalecer la capacidad
institucional del FONDEI y el BCH; e) Promover mejor tramitacion y
supervision de los subprestamos por los IF'S que trabajan con el
FONDEI; f) Analizar el sector industrial, incluida la generaci6n de
datos sectoriales para ayudar a instituir las Reformas de las
Politicas Sectoriales.
En el disen5o del proyecto inclula credito para empresas de
inversi6n, en los rubros de Activo Fijo combinado con Capital de
Trabajo, solamente Capital de Trabajo y para desarrollo de nuevas
tecnicas y la aplicaci6n de nuevas tecnicas existentes de
producci6n; asimismo un programa de asistencia t6cnica para el BCH,
FONDEI, CDI, e Intermediarios Financieros.
El Gobierno y BCH el 10 de Diciembre de 1987 tomaron la decision de
suspender  temporalmente  hasta  el  30  de  Abril  de  1988,  la
utilizaci6n de los recursos destinados para el financiamiento de
empresas de inversi6n, por el alto costo financiero de los mismos,
originado por la aplicaci6n de la canasta de divisas del Banco
Mundial y por el riesgo cambiario.



En el anllisis de alternativas y negociaciones con el BIFE, se
determin6 reasigna.r el saldo del pr6stamo no utilizado, que implic6
introducir las modificaclenes al Convenlo de Prestamo asf: a) En
Abril 1988, se traslad6 US$ 20.0 billones al Gobierno pa.ra apoYO de
la balanza de pages y b) en Junio de 1992 se reasign6 USS 2.0
Millones para el programa de reestructuraci6n inform.1tica del BCE.
Adicionalmente  a  los  cambios  anteriores.  el  Gobierno  habia
norificado al BIRE el 26 de Junio de 1992, la canccelacldn de US$
2.3 Nillones.
Despues de ejecutar el programa de Informatica del BCE, se estima
quedar,d un saldo sin utilizar de aproximadamente US$ 1.9 glllones,
que debera ser cancelada su utilizaci6n.
Evaluando los resultados del proyecto en base a los indicadores de
implementaci6n programadas para el periodo 1986-1989, se observa lo
siguiente: a) Comprometer el 100Z de los recursos financieros; a
noviembre de 1994 se habia comprometido y desembolsado el 85.7; b)
Otorgar 402 subpr6stamos, se otorg6 67 (17*); c) Generar 6, 082
empleos, se estima que gener6 el 532 (9 X); d) Establecimiento de
11 unidades de desarrollo en los Intermediarios Financieros y se
estabZecieron 5; e) Capacitaci6n (entrenamiento) de 110 personas
del FONDEI, BCE, e Intermediarios Financieros, se capacit6 a 202
personas.
El programs de asistencia t4cnica, fue ejecutado con recursos
financieros del Banco Mzndial, PNHD y Contraparte del BCH/FONDEI.
Con parze de estos fondos se adquiri6 parte del equipo de cc5mpuzo
y los programas necesarios, para automatizar principalmente las
operaciones contables del FONDEI.  Igual apoyo se otorg6 al Centro
de Desarrollo Industrial (CDI), principal intermediario financiero
no  bancario,  orientado  a proporcionar  asistencia  tecnica  y
financi era al micro y pequeno empresario, cuyo monto maximo de
financiamiento que canalizaba con recursos del proyecto fue de
L.100,000  por prestatario.    Por  decisi6n  del  Gobierno  esta
instituci6n fue cerrada segun Decreto del Congreso Nacional No. 13-
92 del 8 de Abril de 1992.
A partir de la suspensi6n de la utilizaci6n de los fondos del
pr,s tamo y con el prop6sito de continuar otorgando financiamolento
a la micro, pequeina y mediana empresa, el Directorio del BCH
mediante Resoluci6n No.620-12/87 de fecha 17 de Diciembre de 1987,
estableci6  la  Linea  de  Financiamiento  en  Moneda  Nacional,
constituida con recuperaciones de creditos otorgados a trav4s de
los Convenios 1659-HO, 2075-HO y 2703-HO.



INFORtE DE COMPLIMIENTO DE IMPLElfENTACION
TERCER PROYECTO DE CREDITO INDUSTRIAL
PRESTAMO 2703-HO
1.-  Obietivos v Descripci6n del Provecto:
El Convenio de Prestamo entre la Rep6blica de Honduras y el
Banco Internacional de Reconstrucci6n y Fomento por un monto
de US$ 37.4 millones, fue firmado el 7 de julio de 1986.
Antes de este Proyecto el Banco Mundial habfa otorgado tres
prestamos; dos industriales (1659-HO, 2075-HO) y otro para el
desarrollo  del  Turismo en Honduras  (1673-HO).   El Banco
Mundial ha otorgado al Gobierno de Honduras en total cuatro
prestamos  que  ascienden  a  US$  101.9  millones,  siendo
canalizados por el Banco Central de Honduras a traves del
Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Industrial (FONDEI) hoy Fondo de
Credito para el Desarrollo de la Producci6n (FONDEPRO).
Los objetivos principales del Proyecto 2703-HO fueron:
a.-  Fcmentar las empresas industriales en Honduras,  dando
importancia al desarrollo de las empresas pequenas y
medianas.
.b.-  Proporcionar un mejor flujo de credito a las empresas
industriales.
c.-  Mejorar la situaci6n y capacidad institucional del sector
financiero.
d.-  Fortalecer la capacidad institucional del FONDEI y el
Banco Central.
e. -  Promover una mejor tramitaci6n y supervisi6n  de los
subpr6stamos   por   los   Intermediarios   Financieros
Farticipantes que trabajan con FONDEI.
f.-  Analizar el sector industrial, incluida la generaci6n de
datos sectoriales para ayudar a instituir las reformas de
las politicas sectoriales.
Los objetivos contemplados en el Tercer Frayecto de Cr6dito
Industrial son similares a los establecidos en el Segundo
Proyecto de Credito Industrial, aprobado el 22 de diciembre de
1981, con la modalidad que en el Tercer Proyecto, se amplia el
apoyo al Programa de Asistencia T6cnica con enfasis en el
Desarrollo  Institucional  del  Banco  Central,  FONDEI  e
Intermediarios Financieros.
Se considera que los objetivos delineados fueron claros,
realistas y factibles de alcanZar.



2
2.   E-iecuci6n de Obietivos
a.-  De conformidad al calendarlo de ejecuci6n del proyecto
estaba previsto su cierre para el 31 de diciembre de
1992, por diferentes razones se ha tenido que ampliar
esta fecha hasta el 30 de junio de 1995 (Tabla No.3).
b.-  El programa de desembolsos del prestamo iniciaba el 31 de
marzo de 1987 y conc7uia el 31 de diciembre de 1993, en
vista de la suspensi6n del prestamo efectuada por el
Gobierno y Directorio del Banco Central en diciembre de
1987, motivada por el incremento en el costo financiero
al aplicar el costo de la canasta de di visas del Banco
Mundial y el riesgo cambiario, la utilizaci6n de los
recursos no se efectuo tal como estaba programada, lo
cual origin6 efectuar dos modificaciones al Convenio del
prestamo, especificamente al "Anexo I, Retiros del
Importe del Pr6stamo"; una en abril de 1988 para
reasignar   US$  20.0  millones  de  los   fondos  no
comprometidos en las categorias para subpr6stamos, para
para apoyo de balanza de pagos en apoyo a las primeras
fases del programa de ajuste econ6mico que el Gobierno
iniciaba en dicho afno. La otra modificaci6n se efectuo
en junio de 1992, la cual permiti6 reasignar US$ 2.0
millones, en apoyo del programa de reestruccturacion del
Banco Central, principalmente en las siguientes areas: i)
La  instalaci6n  de  un  sistema  de  administracion
informatica en el BCH; ii) Una evaluaci6n de los alcances
de la reorganizaci6n y la racionalizaci6n de las
funciones que desempenfa; iii) Relaci6n institucional del
BCH con el resto del sector publico y el fortalecimiento
de su autonomia.
Adicional a los cambios anteriores, el Gobierno notific6
el 26 de junio de 1992,  la cancelaci6n de  US$ 2.3
millones.  Tambi6n se estima que despues de ejecutar el
Programa   de Reestructuraci6n  Informatica  del Banco
Central, quedara un saldo de prestamo sin utilizar de
aproximadamente US$ 1.9 millones, que se tendra que
notificar al Banco Mundial la no utilizaci6n.
El proceso de la compra del equipo de computo por el
Departamento de Informatica y Tecnologfa del BCH, ha
tenido que enfrentar varios contratiempos, encontrandose
actualmente en la fase de analisis de las ofertas
presentadas en la Licitaci6n Publica que se efectuara en
el mes Enero de 1995.
c.-  Los   indicadores   de   implementaci6n   del   proyecto
contemplaban para el periodo 1986 - 1989,  que ei 100.' de
los recursos estarian comprometidos; a Noviembre de 1994
estaba compz'ometido y desembolsado el 85% incluido  el

desemabolso de US$ 20.0 millones para balanza de pagos.
Se programaba financiar 402 subprestamos; logrando 67
subprestamos que representa el 17Z;  en generaci6n de
empleo, se programaba 6, 082 nuevos empleos, se estima que
se alcanz6 532 que representa el 9 Z. Netas que se
pudieron log.rar de no haber reasignado los Lps.20. 0 antes
referidos.
d.-  En los objetivos de desarrollo institucional se puede
calificar como resultados satisfactorios, en vista que
para finales de 1989, se programaba establecer dentro de
la  estructura  administrativa  de  los  Intermediarios
Financieros, 11 Unidades de Desarrollo, para desempenfar
las funciones de tramitaci6n, evaluaci6n y supervisi6n de
los proyectos de inversi6n. Se establecieron 5 en igual
numero de Intermediarios financieros, equivalente al 45%
Asimismo  se  elabor6  el  reglamento  de  Autonomia
Crediticia, el cual fue aprobado por el Directorio del
Banco Central de Honduras mediante Resoluci6n No. 299-
6/87, de fecha 25 de junio de 1987,  esto permiti6 que
los IFP's que tenian establecidas sus Unidades de
Desarrollo, pudieran aprobar prestamos en forma aut6noma
hasta Lps. 100,000.00, mecanismo que agiliz6 el tramite
de aprobaci6n y desembolso de los subpr6stamos.   El
limite actual es de hasta Lps. 200,000.00, y estan 11
IFP's autorizados para operar bajo el mismo, aun cuando
no  se  mantiene  las  Unidades  de  Desarrollo  como
originalmente se programaron.
Con la asistencia tecnica de un Consultor se prepar6 el
Reglamento de Rehabilitaci6n de Empresas, el cual fue
aprobado por el Directorio del Banco Central de Honduras,
mediante Resoluci6n 548-11/87, de fecha 5 de noviembre de
1987.     Este  contempla  diferentes  modalidades  de
financiamiento  a  las  empresas  que  por  problemas
especiales han caido en situaci6n de mora o iliquide2,
algunas empresas se han beneficiado de este sistema.
En entrenamiento del personal se programaba capacitar a
110 personas y se capacitaron a mxs de 200 personas del
Banco  Central,  FONDEI,  Intermediarios  Financieros  y
Consul tores.
El Programa de Asistencia Te'cnica, fue ejecutado con
recursos  financieros  del  Banco  Pfndial,   PNUD  7
conttraparte del FONDEI. Tambien a traves del mismo se
logr6 adquirir parte del equipo de computo y los
programas necesarios, para automatizar principalmente las
operaciones contables del FONDEI.  Igual apoyo se otorg6
al Centro de Desarrollo Industrial (C.D.I.), principal
Intermediario  Financiero,  orientado  a  proporcionar
asistencia tecnica y financiera al micro y pequenfo

empresario, cuyo monto maximo de financiamiento con
recursos del Froyecto era de Lps. 100,000.00 por
pres ta t2ri .
3.-  PrinceDales Factores aue afectaron el Provecto
El principal factor que afect6 la ejecuci6n del proyecto, fue
el costo de la canasta de divisas que aplic6 el Banco Mundial
a la amortizaci6n de capital e intereses del prestamo, lo que
motiv6 que el Gobierno como prestatario y el Banco Central de
Honduras como administrador, tomaran la decisi6n de suspender
temporalmente la utilizaci6n del mismo.
Despues de los analisis y negociaciones correspondientes se
determin6 reasignar VSS 20.0 millones para balanza de pagos
contempladas en el Inciso C) del Anexo I del Convenio de
Prestamo modificado.
2    Tambien se reasign6 US$ 2. 0 millones para que el Banco Central
de Honduras, ejecutara el Frograma de Reestructuraci6n
Informa'tica atraves del Departamento de Informitica y
Tecnologia. Este componente por diferentes razones ha tenido
retrasos en su implementaci6n, especialmente en el proceso de
Licitaci6n del equipo de computo a comprar.
Ademas del incremento del costo financiero por la Canasta de
Divisas, esta el riesgo cambiario.Ambos factores influyeron
para no continuar otorgando subpr6stamos a la empresa privada.
El Convenio de Prestamo contemplaba la opci6n de otorgar los
financiamientos en d6lares y su repago en esta misma moneda,
pero existieron limitaciones de tipe legal que no permitieron
legalizar prestamos en d6lares.
4.-  Sostenih ilidad de7 Provecto
Ser considera que la ejecuci6n del Prestamo 2703-HO, aunque se
utfliz6 s6lo una parte para credito industrial y asistencia
tecnica, ha contribuido a la sostenibilidad de los principales
objetivos del Proyecto.
A partir de la suspensi6n de la utilizaci6n de los recursos
financieros del Tercer Proyecto de Credito Industrial,  con el
prop6sito de continuar otorgando prestamos de mediano y largo
plazo a la micro, pequenia y mediana empresa, el Directorio del
Lanco Central de Honduras, mediante Resoluci6n 620-12/87 de
fecha 17 de Diciembre de 1987, estableci6 la LINEA DE
FINANCIAfIENTO INDUSTRIAL EN MONEDA NACIONAL, cons ti tui da con
recuperaciones de los creditos otorgados a traves de los
Convenios 1659-HO, 2075-HO y 2703-HO.



5
Anteriormente a esta Linea, el Directorio del Banco Central de
Honduras mediante Resoluci6n 1956/12/84 de fecha 20 de
Di ci embre   de  1984,   habia   establecido   la   LINEA   DE
FINANCIAfIENTO  PARA  HOTELES  Y ACTIVIDADES  CONEXAS,  con
recuperaciones de los prestamos otorgados bajo el Convenio
2673-HO. Ambas Lfneas se mantienen vigentes actualmente.
Como se puede observar, la Sostenibilidad del Proyecto durante
los ultimos 7 afnos, ha sido posible  mediante el otorgamiento
de financiamientos con recursos provenientes de recuperaciones
de los prestamos otorgados.
Posteriormente la actividad financiera del FONDEI (FONDEPRO),
fue incrementada en diciembre de 1988, con el proyecto AID No.
522-0241 Pequenia Empresa II (FOPME), por Lps. 30.0 millones,
correspondiendo Lps. 28.0 Millones  Fondo de Prestamo y Lps.
2.0 millones Fondo de Garantia, el cual tuvo muy buenos
resultados, (Recursos no reembolsables).
En octubre de 1991, tambien fueron transferidos al FONDEI
(FONDEPRO) las Lineas de Financiamiento Industrial, que
administraba el Departamento del Banco Central de Honduras,
denominado Programa de Reactivaci6n Industrial (PRI), que
comprende Lineas de Financiamiento del Banco Centroamericano
de Integraci6n Economica (BCIE), BID, Fondo de Exportaciones
de  Venezuela  (FINEXPO),  C.C.C.  y  Fondo  de  Ayuda  al
Equipamiento  Espafna-Honduras  estos  ultimos  recursos  no
reembolsables.
Congruente con lo anterior y como parte del proceso de
reestructuraci6n del Banco Central de Honduras, se fusion6 el
Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Industrial (FONDEI) y la Unidad
del Proyecto de Cr6dito de Agropecuario (UPCA) en Junio de
1993, con una drastica reducci6n del personal al grado que
actualmente solamente cuenta con 37 empleados, incluido las
dos oficinas regionales, San Pedro Sula y La Ceiba, esto ha
permitido reducciones significativas en costos operativos.
5. -  DPesempepnO de7 Banca
El desempeno del Banco Mundial durante las etapas de
preparaci6n,  evaluaci6n  y  supervisi6n  del  Proyecto  fue
satisfactorio.
En la parte de preparaci6n y implementaci6n del Proyecto se
tuvo la asistencia de un Consultor que contribuy6 mucho a
concretar las actividades de estas fases, sin embargo no se
analiz6 con profundidad, los posibles cambios en la canasta de
moneda.  Asimismo, siempre se ha observado en los funcionarios
del Banco Mundial, receptividad y anuencia para ana2izar y



6
acordar alternativas de soluci6n,   a los problemas que en
determinado momeento se han presentado en la ejecucion de las
diferentes etapas del Proyecto.
Estas soluciones se han dado dentro de las reguZaciones
permi tidas y en el menor tiempo posible,  tales como las
modificaciones al Convenio de Prestamo, que permitieron las
reasignaciones de recursos financieros a destinos factibles de
atender dentro de los terminos del Convenio.
6.- DesemDeiio del Prestatarlo
En las fases de negociacion y diseffo del Prestsmo, en lo que
corresponde al Gobierno y al BCH como Unidad Ejecutora, se
colabor6 con el Banco Aundial, preparando toda la informaci6n
financiera y estadistica, necesaria para concretar el Convenio
de Prestamo.
En la alternativa de otorgar subpr6stamos denominados en
dolares, cuyo repago se esperaba fuera en esta misma moneda,
no se tom6 en cuenta las limitaciones legales existentes, para
otorgar prestamos en d6lares, raz6n por la que no se promovi6
esta  forma  de financiamiento que hubiera  con tribuido  ha
daisminuir el riesgo cambiario.
La decisi6n de suspender la utilizaci6n de los recursos del
prestamo, para  financiar a traves de los  Intermediarios
Financieros, al Sector Privado fue acertada porque evit6
con tinuar  subsidiandolo,  por  los  efectos  en  el  costo
financiero, de la canasta de divisas y el riesgo cambiario.
Las negociaciones y enmiendas al Convenio de Prestamo para la
reasignaci6n de los recursos se efectuaron en el menor tiempo
posible, lo que  permiti6 continuar utilizando los recursos
del pr6stamo por parte del Gobierno para balanza de pagos y al
BCH para reforzar su programa de Informa'tica. For otra parte
en la ejecuci6n del Programa de Asistencia Tecnica, se logr6
una mayor coordinaci6n entre las instituciones involucradas,
que permiti6 alcanzar logros satisfcatorios.
La modalidad introducida en el Tercer ?ro*vecto de Credito
Industrial.  en el  componente de   asistencia  t6cnica,  de
efectuar diagn6sticos en los Intermediarios Financieros, para
que estos procedieran ha establecer  Unidades de Desarrollo
dentro de su estructura organizativa, como requisito prerio
para   otorgarles  limites  de  aprobaci6n  aut6noma,   fue
satisfactoria, porque existi6 receptividad en algunos Bancos
en establecerlas.
Estas   Unidades   a  Secciones  de  Credito,   ademas   del
financiamiento a traves de las 7ineas de financiamiento del
FONDEPRO, tambien atendlan las operaciones con sus propios
recursos, pero contribuy6 a agili zar el tramite del credito y



7
existi6 mayor coordinaci6n con la Secci6n de supervisi6n del
FONDEPRO para el seguimiento de los prestamos.
7.   Rvaiuanf6n del R&Aesultae
El primer desembolso del pr6stamo se efectu6 el 21 de marzo de
1987, continuando atendiendo al sector industrial con el
financiamiento  canalizado  a  traves  de  Banco  Central,
FONDEI    (FONDEPRO)    e   Intermediarios    Financieros
Participantes para la Micro, Pequenia y Nediana Empresa
obteniendo los resultados siguientes:
a.-  Financiamiento de 67 proyectos de inversi6n de la Micro,
Pequena y Mediana Empresa Industrial, por un monto de
prestamo de Lps. 28.9 millones, correspondiendo Lps. 21.7
millones  con recursos del Banco Nundial y Lps.  7.2
millones con recursos del Banco Central/FONDEI,  fTabla
No.  16).    Estos proyectos  de  inversi6n  se  estima
generaron 532 nuevos empleos.
b.-  El financiamiento fue orientado en un 89.%' para la mediana
empresa equivalente a Lps. 25. 7 millones la diferencia de
Lps. 3.2 Nillones a la Micro y pequenfa empresa (Tabla No.
16).    Nediana Empresa es la que tiene activos flios
netos excluyendo terrenos y edificios mayores a Lps.
400,000.00.
c.-  Por rubros de inversi6n, los recursos fueron destinados
Lps. 20.5 millones para Activo Fijo y Lps. 8.4 millones
para Capital de TrabaJo, equivalente al 71X y 29% del
financiamiento total respectivamente (Tabla No. 17).
d.-  Los   Intermediarios  Financieros   Participantes   que
canalizaron la mayor parte de los recursos financieros
fueron Banco Continental (22%), BANCAHSA (1f8) y Banco de
los Trabajadores C16%), (Tabla No. 19).
e.-  La  actividad  industrial  que  hizo  mayor  uso  del
financiamiento  fueron:      Fabricaci6n  de  productos
metalicos,   maquinaria  y  equipo   (24X);  Productos
alimenticios, bebidas 7 tabaco (16*) yproductos qulmicos
derivados de petr6leo, caucho y pllstico (13X), (Tabla
No. 20).  Asimismo, en la distribuci6n geogra'fica el
financiamiento se concentr6 en los Departamentos de
Francisco Morazan y Cortes, principalmente en las
ciudades de Tegucigalpa y San Pedro Sula en 60X y 36X
respectivamente, por las condiciones que reunen estas
zonas geograficas (Tabla No. 21).

La ejecuci6n del componente de Asistencia T6cnica en el
Segundo Proyecto de Credito Industrial, desde febrero de
1983, fue coordinada con la asesoria de un Consultor.  En
el  Tercer Proyecto  de  Credito  Industrial  parte  se
continuo con la asesoria del Consultor hasta liegar a
establecer  La  Unidad  de  Aslstencia  T6cni cs,   de
conformidad a los t6rminos del Convenio.  Esta Unidad
qued6 dentro de la estructura organizativa del FONDEI,
como dependencia directa de la Direcci6n; establecida
mediante Resoluci6n No. 348-7/86 del Directorio del Banco
Central de Honduras, de fecha 7 de Julio de 1986.  El
prop6sito principal de 6sta, fue coordinar la ejecuci6n
del programa de Asistencia Tecnica, que comprende lo
siguiente:
a.- Asistencia Tecnica al FONDEI e Intermediarios
Financieros Participantes,  para mejorar el sistema
de  administraci6n  e  informaci6n,  tramita ci 6n,
evaluaci6n y supervisi6n de los proyectos de
inversion.
b.- Asistencia tecnica al C.D.I. para mejorar el apoyo
a la micro empresa.
a.- Asistencia   tecnica   al   Departamento   de   la
Superintendencia de Bancos del Banco Central, para
fortalecer   la   capacidad   de   supervisar   las
transacciones y desempeno de la Banca Comercial.
d.- Para que Banco Central elaborara los estudios
siguientes: a) Sobre mecanismos para movilizar el
Credito a mediano y largo plazo con tasas variables
de interes; b) Un censo del sector industrial; c)
Analizar las limitaciones que pueden existir al
aumento de las inversiones; y d) Evaluar el sistema
de asignaci6n de divisas. (Tabla No. 7).
e.- For parte del Gobierno: a) Evaluar el regimen de
importaci6n temporal y establecido por el Decreto
No. 37 el 27 de diciembre de 1984; y b) Informe
comp leto  sobre  los  aranceles  existentes  y  las
propuestas para la reforma arancelaria. (Tabla No.
7).

9.   Lecciones Claves ArDrendidas
a)   Mientras no hubo mayores riesgos  cambiarios  existi6
demanda de parte del Sector Industrial para estos
recursos, con lo cual consideramos que durante ese
periodo de estabilidad fue muy positiva su ejecuci6n.
b)   La asistencia tecnica para que los IFFS establecieran
Unidades   de  Desarrollo  dentro  de  su  estructura
organizativa, aun cuando en la practica las mismas, no se
establecier6n como un centro de utilidades y costos,
permiti6 al menos en los Bancos con mayor cartera de
prestamos con recursos del FONDEI,  mantener en forma
permanente oficiales de credito encargados para atender
los asuntos relacionados con el FONDEI. Esto no fue en
forma exclusiva y siempre se ha registrado rotaci6n en
estos cargos, situacion que por lo general se da en todo
el sistema bancario.
c)   Con la ejecucion de este Proyecto, se financiaron algunas
actividades  de  exportaci6n    a largo plazo  como  el
camar6n, que no proporciona el sistema bancario con sus
propios recursos,  derivandose como una lecci6n que el
sistema bancario no dispone de recursos de largo plazo
para el Sector Industrial.
d)   La lecci6n que se puede tomar de la ejecuci6n de este
convenio de prestamo, el que en la fase de negociacicn y
disenTo del proyecto, debe hacerse un analisis profundo
del costo financiero de estos recursos, originado por la
Canasta de Divisas y el riesgo cambiario, determinando un
mecanismo que permita que el mismo, sea cubierto por los
diferentes  participantes  en  la   canalizaci6n   del
financiamiento hasta el prestatario final.
e)   Que  el  sistema  de otorgar financiamiento  al  sector
industrial,  en  dolares y  legalizar  el  prestamo  en
Lempira, sin mantenimiento de valor, representa p6rdidas
significativas para el Gobierno y Banco Central y un
subsidio para el usuario final del financiamiento, en
este caso   oportunamente se tom6 la decisi6n de no
continuar utilizando el pr6stamo bajo este esquema.
