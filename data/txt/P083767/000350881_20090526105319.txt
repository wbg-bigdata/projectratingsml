                                       INTRODUCTION

1. This document submits (i)a proposal to the Executive Directors for a replenishment o f
the TFGWB. The Bank would request them to recommend that the Board o f Governors
authorize the transfer from IBRD surplus o f the amount o f US$55 million to the Trust Fund
for Gaza and West Bank (TFGWB) and (ii)an EmergencyProject Paper for a proposed
Emergency Response Additional Finance Program through scale-up of six ongoing
operations in the amount of US$21.5 million. The proposed replenishment remains aligned
with the endorsed Interim Strategy (IS) for FYO8-10 and will finance three new operations:
        Second Development Policy Grant (US$40 million, being presentedto you today)
    0   Municipal Development Project (US$lO million, scheduled for Board presentation in
        Q2 FY10); and
        Teacher Education Improvement Program (US$5 million, scheduled for Board
        presentation in 4 3 FY10).

2. Implementation o f the previous seven replenishments o f the TFGWB remains
satisfactory, and resources allocated for the 2008 replenishment have been earmarked for
three operations:
        First Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (PRDP) Development Policy Grant
        (US$40 million approved on June 5,2008);
    0   Southern West Bank Solid Waste Management Project ($10 million - approved on
        May 14,2009); and
    0   Land Administration I1 Project ($3 million - scheduled for Board presentation in 4 2
        FY10).

3. The proposed scale-up in the amount of US$21.5 million relates to six ongoing
operations and is processed under the Operational Policy 8:OO - Rapid Responses to
Crisis and Emergencies.The six operations are: Electric Utility Management Project, Third
Emergency Services Support Project, Gaza Emergency Water Project, Emergency Municipal
Services Rehabilitation I1 Project, Palestinian NGO 111 Project, and Tertiary Education
Project. Since resources from the last TFGWB replenishment have been already earmarked,
the proposed scale-up will be financed from the TFGWB's balance from reflows from
service charges, commitment fees and investment income as shown below:

4. The proposed scale-up program is a critical element of the World Bank's response
to the post-crisis situation in Gaza following the recent escalation of the conflict in
Gaza.      Given the Bank's comparative advantage o f being involved and leading the
international community in several sectors in Gaza, the Bank team proposes to scale up those
well performing operations that have the potential to make a difference for the Gazan
population. With this operation, the Bank intends to provide a balanced support to Gaza by
maintaining human capital and making the necessary repairs to get critical infrastructure
(electricity? water) working again. Approximately, less than one third (US$6 million) o f the
total allocation will be devoted to repairs and reconstruction while more than two thirds
(US$15, 5 million) will focus on projects that aim at preserving human capital.

5. The Emergency Response Additional Finance Program identifies the most important risks
and mitigation measures adopted in each o f the operations. Also, the strategy o f diversifying
the projects helps mitigate the risks of a change in the PA government. The bulk o f the
Bank's assistance to the PA is directed through budget support to help strengthen their
institutions. However, the Bank also continues to support projects that can continue to
deliver services to the population in case there is a disruption to the PA government services.
The Bank's approach reduces risks by supporting recovery in Gaza through channeling
additional funding to existing programs that have proven they can operate under the current
closure conditions. This is a less risky approach than attempting to start new projects that
might not be able to perform as well. It also reflects that fact that the current Bank projects
meet the needs o fthe Gaza population.



                               I.BACKGROUND CONTEXT      AND

A.          Impact of the Recent Conflict in Gaza

6. The recent escalation of conflict in Gaza lasted roughly three weeks (December 27,
2008 - January 18, 2009) and included aerial and naval bombardment, artillery
shelling, as well as ground operations. At least 1,314 Palestinians lost their lives and four
times as many were wounded (roughly half o f whom women and children).                              More than
100,000 people were displaced; over 15,000 homes damaged or destroyed; public
infrastructure and utilities, including water, sanitation? electricity, and transportation
networks damaged severely; and businesses, factories, and farmland leveled'. During the
hostilities, the lives o f approximately one million Israelis living within a 40km range from
the border of Gaza were disrupted and put under threat as a result o f firing of rockets and
mortars by Palestinian armed groups. Close to 1,200~sites were struck in southern Israel
leading to the death o f 3 Israelis and the injury o f 1822. At the end o f January 2009, the
ceasefire unilaterally declared by Israel and the Palestinian armed groups was only partially
holding: incidents o f rocket firing towards Israel by Palestinian militants, as well as airstrikes

  According to Magen DavidAdom, the Israeli national aid society under the International Committee ofthe Red
  Cross, as quoted inthe January 2009 issue of TheHumanitarian Monitor (page3), Office for the Coordination of
  HumanitarianAffairs, UnitedNations.

and land incursions by the Israeli army, occur on an almost daily basis, resulting in a number
o f additional Palestinian deaths and injuries.

7. The consequenceson the local economy are large. Even before the onset o f hostilities,
the macroeconomic environment in the West Bank and Gaza had been more difficult than
anticipated in the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (PRDP) for 2008-10. Overall,
real GDP growth in 2008 in the WB&G i s estimated at about 2 %, which translates to a
decline o f more than 1 % inreal per capita terms, resulting in a per capita income o fjust over
US$l,OOO in 2008. The Gazan economy, already devastated from years o f movement and
access restrictions, was further ravaged by the recent conflict.           Consequently, what little
growth has occurred, has taken place inthe West Bank.

8. The private sector in Gaza has been severely weakened by the incursion and is
constrainedby the restrictionsto access and movement. Though much o f the damage was
sustained by already closed businesses, their destruction ensures that they will not be able to
quickly recover once conditions improve.          A preliminary assessment by the Palestinian
Private Sector Coordinating Council estimates that the recent fighting resulted in US$140
million in damage to Gaza businesses.

9. On the other hand, the global financial crisis has thus far not had a significant impact on
the Palestinian economy (IMF, 20093).


B.        Recovery Plan and FinancingNeeds

10. In the attempt to estimate the damage of the recent conflict the PA Ministries and
Agencies, with the support of local and international partners, have made extensive
analysis in all sectors and activities of the Palestinian economy. It covers both the early
recovery projects and the medium-to-longer term reconstruction interventions.                Such
analysis, summarized in the "Palestinian National Early Recovery and Reconstruction Plan
for Gaza 2009-IO", was made public on the occasion o f the "International Conference in
Support of the Palestinian Economy for the Reconstruction o f Gaza" in Sharm El Sheikh, on
March 2, 2009. The event was sponsored by Egypt and co-sponsored by Norway to respond
to the early recovery and reconstruction needs o f the Palestinians in Gaza in the aftermath o f
the recent conflict. The conference represented an opportunity for the donor community to
demonstrate support and commitment to the reconstruction process. It was also the occasion
for the PA to affirm its leadership in the recovery and reconstruction process and to present
its "Palestinian National Early Recovery and Reconstruction Plan for Gaza 2009-2010".
Participants pledged an approximate total o f US$4.481 billion covering the next two years.

11. The assessment documents the damage to and the needs of several sectors in Gaza,
includingthe social sectors, infrastructure, agriculture, the private sector, and natural
resources and the environment. Inthe health sector, it lays out how Gaza's emergency and
primary health care systems were overstretched and under-supported during the conflict, and
many medical facilities sustained severe damage. Border closures prevented the flow o f
crucial medical supplies, the transfer o f high risk medical cases, and the capacity to rapidly
respond to      emergency cases was          significantly    diminished.      Numerous   education

establishments, from kindergarten to university level, also suffered extensive damage.
Vulnerable groups have been particularly affected, as a number o f orphanages, centers for
disabled, youth, and women were damaged. More importantly, the number o f poor people
(in most cases lacking shelter), disabled, orphans, and female-headed households has
increased, which has burdened even further the social safety network. Mosques, cultural
institutions, and historic buildings also suffered extensive damage. The escalation o f the
conflict severely impacted the provision of basic services, with extensive disruption caused to
water and sanitation networks, energy supplies and facilities, roads, bridges, and the
telecommunications system.          The agriculture sector was severely affected, with the
widespread destruction of cultivated land (over 80 percent), greenhouses, livestock and
poultry farms, water wells, irrigation networks, and other productive assets. Fragile ground-
water resources were severely compromised, particularly from the destruction o f the waste-
water infrastructure, which released hundreds o f thousands o f cubic meters o f raw sewage
into the environment. Figure 1 shows that estimated needs are greatest inthe areas o f shelter
and housing, agriculture, and social assistance/support to vulnerable groups.

12. The early assessment, and the resulting Early Recovery Plan 2009-2010 issued by
the PA, use the situation prior to 27fhDecember 2008 as a baseline but contextualize it
within the experience of the long and continuing closures of Gaza. The goal is therefore
not merely to turn the clock back two months, or even to June 2007, but to make a qualitative
change to the socio-economic situation in Gaza. In coordination and agreement with the UN
Agencies involved, early recovery projects included in the original UN Flash Appeal have
been expanded and included in the Early Recovery Plan to provide the bridge betweenshort-
term relief and medium and longer-term development. Thus, while the immediate emergency
needs were mostly met, the Early Recovery Plan sets out prioritized early recovery actions
and longer-term interventions designed to have a permanent, positive impact on the lives o f

 Gaza's 1.5 million inhabitants. The EU, the UN, and the Bank are planning to carry out a
 Post Conflict Needs Assessment (PCNA) that would spell out detailed reconstruction
 priorities for Gaza that will be in turn incorporated into the PA's revised version o f the
 PRDP.

 13. There are several prerequisites for the success of this ambitious program for
 Gaza's reconstructionthat are equally applicable to bringing about revival in the West
 Bank. As well as the international community continuing to offer its cooperation and
 support, the political situation must be stabilized, and the crossings must be permanently
 opened for the normal movement o f people and goods, in line with previous agreements
 reached with Israel. The Palestinian economy in Gaza will only be able to recover after the
 closure o f Gaza i s ended and liquidity returns to the financial system. The 2005 Agreement
 on Movement and Access (AMA) should serve as the framework for allowing much-needed
 supplies and expertise into and exports out o f both Gaza and the West Bank (WB, 20094).

 14. To complement the PA report, the World Bank presented its own report with an
 outline of the various fund-channelingoptions to support a coordinatedresponsefor the
 recovery and the reconstruction of Gaza. The World Bank report provides a brief
 overview o f the importance o f budget support to the PA, the role o f PA expenditures in
 providing services to the people o f Gaza, and the various ways o f providing budget support
 (or its equivalent) to the PA. It also describes other Palestinian institutions which have a
 proven track record in implementing donor-financed projects in Gaza in water and sanitation,
 municipal infrastructure, energy, and NGO-based service delivery.



11. STATUSOFIMPLEMENTATION OFTHEAPRIL 2008REPLENISHMENTAND
                       REQUEST FOR THE 2009 REPLENISHMENT

 A.        The Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank

 15. The Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank (TFGWB) was established in 1993 to
 enable the Bank to finance projects in West Bank and Gaza (WB&G). Since WB&G is
 not a sovereign state, it cannot apply for membership o f the IMF or the World Bank Group
 institutions and is, therefore, not eligible for the sources o f financing normally available to
 member countries.
 16. To overcome these legal and practical obstacles, on October 19, 1993, by the terms o f
 resolution No. 93-11 and IDA 93-7, the Executive Directors o f the Bank and the Association
 approved the establishment of the Trust Fund for Gaza (TFG, subsequently renamed the
 Trust Fundfor Gaza and West Bank, TFGWB). In addition, on November 11, 1993, the
 Executive Directors o f the Bank proposed the adoption of a Resolution to the Board of
 Governors. Such resolution requested the transfer, by way o f grant, o f US$50 million to
 the TFG from the US$375 million surplus that the Board o f Governors authorized to be
 transferred to the IDA'S       loth  replenishment. The Board o f Governors approved such
 proposal and, in August I,1995, increased the TFG permissible territorial scope as the area
 under thejurisdiction ofthe PalestinianAuthority was enlarged.

                                                     5

17. The objective of this replenishment is to support the Bank's strategy and assistance
program, both through projects and non-lendingadvisory services in line with the PA's
PRDP. To date, the TFGWB has been replenished seven times for a total allocation of
US$565 million, most recently in June 2008. An additional US$86 million has been
received in the TFGWB from investment income, from service charges and commitment fees
on outstanding credits (minus a US$12 million transfer from the Holst Fund allocated at the
creation o f the TFGWB). This brings the total TFGWB resources to US$639 million. As o f
April 1, 2008, US$602.5 million has been committed to 39 projects, leaving an uncommitted
balance o f US$36.5 million. About US$15 million o f the US$36.5 million is currently
earmarked for two new projects (Southern Solid Waste Management Project, approved on
May 15, 2009 and Second Land Administration Project, scheduled for approval in Q2 F YIO).
In response to the Gaza crisis it is also proposed that additional financing in the amount of
US$21.5 million be allocated to six ongoing projects that have a proven track record of good
implementation performance in Gaza (scheduled for Board by end-May 2009).               Total
disbursements from the TFGWB amount to US$545 million, or 88% o f commitments (Annex
2). Up until 2002, all WB&G funding was provided on IDA Credit terms, however, projects
have since been approved on grant terms.

18. The criteria applicable to the administration of the TFGWB continue to be met.
TFGWB activities are seen as corresponding to the interests o f the Bank's membership,
evidenced by the strong support the Board o f Executive Directors has consistently accorded
to activities financed by the TFGWB. The Bank continues to apply its normal procedures
and safeguards to administering the proceeds o f the TFGWB, and does so whether a project
is credit or grant financed.

19. Reflecting the fluctuating environment in WB&G and the Bank's need for
flexibility to adequately meet the needs of the Palestinian population, the Bank's
engagement in WB&G has been characterizedby a need to adapt. Several phases o f the
Bank's involvement can be described.        During the initial period (1994-1996) the Bank
focused on rehabilitation o f basic physical infrastructure and on providing capacity building
duringthe establishment o f PA institutions. Between 1997 and 2000 the Bank increased its
focus on institutions building, private sector development, and regulatory and institutional
reform. The most recent period from late 2000 to 2008 espoused to twin objectives o f
balancing medium-termdevelopment activities and providing emergency assistance designed
to sustain Palestinian institutions and mitigate poverty.   And so the Bank has developed a
wide variety o f flexible instruments - from budget support through cash transfers to
vulnerable groups and funding non-salary recurrent expenditures in the social sectors, and
emergency municipal assistance, to slow disbursing rehabilitation o f basic infrastructure.
This approachproved to be working very well.

B.         The 2008 Replenishment and the Proposed2009 Replenishment

20. The 2008-2010 WorldBank Interim Strategyfor WB&G is discussed by the Board of
Executive Directors, together with the last request for TFGWB replenishment (US$55
million), on April 22, 2008. The goal of the strategy and assistance program, both
financial and policy-oriented, is to support the PA's PRDP. The PRDP's overarching
objective i s Palestinian economic recovery. The Bank Group's work program is organized
into four pillars in support o f the PA's efforts: (i)improve governance and support fiscal
reform; (ii)support human development in health, education, and social safety nets; (iii)

                                               6

      support economic and private sector development; and (iv) support public infrastructure
      development.     The Bank will continue emphasizing policy reform and institutional
      development in all four areas, using analytical and advisory work and resources from the
      TFGWB, MIGA and IFC. This Strategy proposed a five-fold interventionplan aimed at: (i)
      maintainingsatisfactory implementationof the existing portfolio; (ii)addingmore resources
      to well performing operations and launching selected new operations, including budget
      support; (iii)providing advisory services; (iv) engaging other donors; and (v) involving the
      entire Bank Group.

      21. The ISfor WB&Gfor FYObFYlO remainsvalid. However, it is acknowledgedfor
      the time being that, in Gaza at least, the pre-conditions for recovery are not fully in
      place. The proposed scale-up activities in Gaza are primarily designed to preserve
      socio-economic assets in line with the Bank's Operational Policy (2.30) on Development
      Cooperation and Conflict as a preliminary stage in the recovery. This is consistentwith
      the overall approach of the I S which proposed two replenishmentso f the TFGWB: the first
      one inthe amount of US$55 million 2008 and a second one, in similar amount, in 2009. The


                                                    7

2008 replenishment has been committed to three operations: 1) Development Policy Grant I
(US$40 million i s fully disbursed); 2) Southern West Bank Solid Waste Management Project
(US$lO million - approved on May 14, 2009); and 3) Land Administration I1Project (US$3
million - scheduled for Board presentation in Q2 FYlO and expected to be co-financed by
approximately US$20 million from Finland, Denmark and Greece).

22. At the Board of the ExecutiveDirectors meetingon May 28,2009 the Bank intends
to propose to the Executive Directors a replenishmentof the TFGWB. The Bank would
therefore request them to recommend that the Board of Governors authorize the
transfer from IBRD surplusof the amount of US$55 million to the TFGWB.

23. The new replenishment would finance one development policy grant and two
investmentoperations, as follows:

    0   The second DevelopmentPolicy Grant (DPG2; US$40 million; scheduled for Board
        presentation on May 28, 2009). The PA has again requested that a substantial portion
        o f the 2009 replenishment be allocated in the form o f budget support through the
        Central Treasury Account. Disbursement o f the DPG2 is linked to progress on
        implementation o f the PRDP; specifically in the areas o f fiscal strengthening and
        improving public financial management, which are central to the policy dialogue
        between the PA, IMF and the World Bank. The Bank's use o f the Central Treasury
        Account is an important factor in encouraging other donors to trust the PA's financial
        management systems and to also provide critical budget support. Therefore, this
        operation i s expected to generate large contributions to the Bank-administered PRDP
        Multi-Donor Trust Fund that provides untied budget support to assist the
        implementation o f key aspects o f the PRDP.

        Municipal DevelopmentProject (US$lO million; scheduled for Board presentation
        in Q1 FYlO) will build on the success of the earlier municipal development projects.
        It will finance the PA's Municipal Development Program (MDP), to support the
        PRDP's goals for development at the local level both in the West Bank and in Gaza.
        This program will provide performance based grants to municipalities, thereby
        creating incentives for municipalities to improve their performance. The objective o f
        the first three years o f the M D P (phase 1) is to improve municipal management
        practices and services for better accountability.

        Teacher Education Improvement Program (US$5 million, scheduled for Board in
        4 3 FY10) will support the Ministry o f Education and Higher Education's second
        sector strategy in West Bank and in Gaza - the Education Development Strategic
        Plan 2008-2012 (EDSP), which is an integral part o f the PRDP. Belgium, KfW,
        Ireland, Finland, Norway, and the World Bank agreed to coordinate and harmonize
        their support to the EDSP.

24. In addition, the Bank has played an important role in WB&G as administrator of
other donors' funds. Interms o f financing, the Bank is a small player in WB&G. However,
the Bank has administered almost US$1.5 billion o f funds provided by other donors through
co-financing. Thus the Bank has administered almost US$3 o f donors' resources for every
US$1 committed from the TFGWB. The ratio i s even higher (US$4 for every TFGWB
dollar) ifwe include donors' parallel financing to World Bank projects.

       Total closedtrust funds include all single TFs andMDTFs

25. The Emergency Services Support Program (ESSP) Multi-Donor Trust Fund (co-
finances the ongoing US$lOm Bank-financed ESSP project) has served as a vehicle for
donors to provide another avenue for funds toward funding non-salary recurrent expenditures
for the PA budget, mainly in the social sectors (Ministries o f Education & Higher Education,
Health, and Social Affairs). An additional US$23 million in donor co-financing from the EC
and other bi-lateral donors was received in FY08 and FY09.

26. The Bank administered Multi-Donor Trust Fund for budget support (PRDP-TF
established inApril 2008) is linked to the implementation o f key aspects o f the PRDP as they
relate to budget execution within an overall macroeconomic framework. To date, Kuwait,
the UK, Norway, Australia, France, Finland, Poland and Canada have contributed
approximately US$301million to support the PA's current expenditures.

27. The IFC is increasing its activities in the West Bank and Gaza, and currently has a
committed investment portfolio of US$62 million. In FY08, IFC committed US$I7million in
a trade finance and a student loans project, and in FY09 has already committed US$.50
million in the financial and telecom sectors (including the landmark Wataniya telecom
project). IFC expects to make further investmentsin trade finance, housing finance, and the
agriculture sector, among others. IFC has also been providing advisory services through its
facility in the Middle East and North Africa, PEP-MENA. IFC i s currently developing the
legal and regulatory environment for leasing in cooperation with the Capital Markets
Authority (CMA). IFC's advisory services interventions in the past has included: (i)assisting
bottling companies in the olive oil sector focusing on supply chain development, product

                                                     9

quality, and access to export markets; IFC i s currently working on having a new project in
the olive oil sector that will compliment the first one (ii)developing a corporate governance
code in cooperation with the Palestinian Monetary Authority and the CMA; (iii)assessing the
potential demand and current supply o f microfinance services in an effort to increase access
to finance; and (iv) assisting Al-Rafah Microfinance bank in rolling out its microfinance
activities. IFC i s expected to provide additional advisory services in the field o f housing
finance training.

28. MIGA established a Guarantee Fund in 1997 to cover political risks, with
contributions from the PA, Japan and the European Investment Bank.               With a current
underwriting capacity o f up to $30 million, the Fund remains in place but has not been
utilized by investors due the restrictions on movement and access that continued to hinder
investment. In response to this, MIGA has restructured the fund to cover other forms o f risk
and for larger amounts. These changes have been approved by the donors and the Fund
operations have been re-launched with the new operating criteria in November 2008. While
the Guarantee Fund remains operational to encourage FDI, the main changes have been: (i)
the opening up o f the coverage local private sector investor, (ii)coverage to non-shareholder
loans on a stand-alone basis, and (iii)the covering a portion o f the existing investments when
accompanied by new investments.        Since the re-launch the Guarantee Fund has received
inquiries and one new application for an Infrastructure project, which i s currently being
reviewedby MIGA for possible coverage.

29. To ensure continued alignment of Bank-supported projectswith Palestinian needs
and programs (such as PRDP), and continued harmonization of its portfolio with other
donor initiatives, the Bank plays an active role in the local aid coordinationstructure,
the Local Development Forum (LDF), and its associated strategy groups and sector working
groups. In addition to acting as a co-chair o f the LDF, the Bank i s co-chair o f the Economic
Strategy Group and the Private Sector Development and Trade Sector Working Group, and i s
a member o f each o f the Infrastructure, Social & Humanitarian Assistance, and Governance
Strategy Groups, and o f the Task Force on Project Implementation which liaises with the
Government o f Israel. These joint Palestinian-donor groups represent forums to discuss
strategy and priorities with the PA and other donors, identify obstacles and critical issues and
participate in updates on ongoing programs and projects. The World Bank will continue to
play a leading role in local aid coordination and continue to allocate the necessary resources
for this purpose.

30. The World Bank team continues to work closely with the Office of the Quartet
Representative, Tony Blair. One Bank staff has been working part time with OQR for
about a year, and since November 2008 has been seconded on a full time basis to OQR team
as economic advisor and deputy head o f the OQR office in Jerusalem. Mr.Blair i s working
with Israel and the PA in promoting a "confidence-building" process to help kick-start the
Palestinian economy. Last May he announced a revised package o f Quick Impact Projects
(QIPs) that cover four main areas:

        Economic and social development, including development o f two industrial parks;
        facilitating the release o f frequencies for a second mobile license (Wataniya);
         encouraging housing projects; facilitating tourism development in Bethlehem;
        developing an agro-industrial park in Jericho; and advancing various infrastructure
        projects;


                                              10

    0   Lifting Access and Movement restrictions, including the revamping or removal of
         several roadblocks inthe West Bank;
    0   Developing Area C, which is 60% o f the West Bank and under Israeli military and
         civilian control;
    0    Proper security capability and performance by the PA, complementing measures
        taken by the PA to improve their security capability (following the city o f Jenin
         model).

31. The World Bank Group is supporting some of the Quick Impact Projects,
particularly the introduction of a second mobile operator, the infrastructure projects in
Gaza, the housing finance facility (through IFC), and overall economic reform. In
addition, Mr.Blair has played an instrumental role in coordination with the Israeli authorities
so that construction material for implementation o f Bank projects and cash is allowed to cross
into Gaza. We will continue working closely with the OQR and in offering overall economic
advice on a broad range o f issues.

32. The Bank has a comparative advantage in a wide range of sectors in WB&G (such
as public finance and management, governance, water and sanitation, municipal
development,      social service delivery,     education,    community development,         and
electricity) but needs to maximize the impact of its relatively limited resources. As a
result, the Bank Group is not financially involved in additional sectors where other donors
take the lead (such as transport, health or agriculture) but where possible, provides assistance
through policy and technical assistance.

33. The IS'S performance is being assessed against a set of PRDP indicators aimed at
measuring the Bank contribution to PRDP objectives.              These indicators have been
updated to take the proposed scale-up program into account (see Annex 4). Progress
against these indicators will be assessed on an ongoing basis, through regular consultations
with the PA, key stakeholders, and donors.
C.         Portfolio Assessment and Results

34. Portfolio performance remains satisfactory thanks to the combined efforts of the
PA and Bank staff.        Two key indicators provide a snapshot o f this improvement: net
commitments at risk have been reduced from 45.5% in FY07 to 31.3% in FYO8 and the
disbursement rate increased from 44.4% inFY07 to 52.4 % in FY08.

35. Since the 2008 IS, the size of the portfolio has decreased by two projects (three new
projects were approved: Development Policy Grant, Electricity Utility Management, Village
and Neighborhood; and five projects closed: Development Policy Grant, Integrated
Community Development, Land Administration, Emergency Water, and Avian Influenza).
In addition, three well performing projects (Social Safety Net Reform Project, Gaza
Emergency Water, and North Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment projects) were scaled up
in April 2008 and projects' closing dates were extended.       However, due to the constantly
changing political and security situation that has had a negative impact on implementation
progress, closing dates for two projects have been extended.




                                                11

36. The Bank's ongoing portfolio consists of 10 projects (see Annex 2), focusing on
social safety net, education, water & sanitation, solid waste, municipal finance, electricity,
and the NGO sector with a net commitment amount o f US$141.6 million as o f April 2009.

37. The Bank has delivered a strong AAA program. The Bank's analytical and policy
work has, from the outset, laid the basis for our role in WB&G.                 Since the 2008
replenishment and status report, we have prepared a health policy report, undertaken a water
restriction study, provided recommendations for policy and regulatory reform for
telecommunications sector, and estimated the economic impact o f lack o f access to land. We
continue to provide transport sector TA, conduct a financial sector review, help to set up a
higher education and student loan scheme, and --together with the IFC-- we provide
assistance in housing finance (see Annex 2).
D.         Lessons Learned

38. Regularly scheduled Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPRs; most
recently undertaken in February 2009) and close supervision of projects have enabled
the project teams to keep abreast of critical implementation issues and generated a
number of lessons learned for working in a posthn-conflict environment:

    0    Adjustments to the overall direction o f the portfolio need to be continuously made in
         order to accommodate shifting priorities o f the client, other donor interventions and
         internal assessments o f where the Bank can best influence sector-wide policy choices
         and leverage donor funds.
    0    Project design needs to be simple, realistic, and flexible in order to respond to
         changing circumstances on the ground and implementation capacities in counterpart
         ministries. Adjustments to project design, whether done through cancellation o f non-
         performing components or as whole-scale restructurings should be done proactively
         and through close consultations with the counterparts.
         Ifa project contains longer term institutional and capacity buildingobjectives, which
         inpost-conflict environments may be more difficult to achieve, these should be front-
         loaded inthe implementation schedule to be able to reap possible early benefits.
         The size o f the portfolio should be optimized to the Bank's comparative advantage
         and the absorptive capacity o f the recipient. Where appropriate and to reduce
         transaction costs, additional financing should be utilized to top up funding for
         projects which have demonstrated results on the ground.


                     111. THEPROPOSED         SCALE-UP PROGRAM

A.         Rationale for Bank Intervention

39. Although with limited amounts of resources, the Bank is well placed to support the
ERC. The most effective and expeditious way is through scale-up of on-going successful
activities that are implemented in Gaza through two interventions: (i)small scale reallocation




                                               12

o f resources within the on-going projects' categories; and (ii) proposed program of scale-
                                                                                 the
up o f selected operations'.

40. The Bank portfolio was not suspended during the Gaza crisis. However, project
implementation in Gaza suffered greatly because: (i)injury and/or death o f project
personnel and others who could not report to work and almost all project activities were
stopped; (ii)complete closure of Gaza during this period; (iii)several project sites (Tertiary
Education, Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation 11, Palestinian NGO 111, and North
Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment) were damaged (see table below); (iii)inability o f
service providers to collect user fees (solid waste, water, electricity), and (iv) crossing o f
personnel, material, and cash into Gaza was and remains very difficult. The Bank carried out
a field mission to West Bank and to Gaza in early-February, and together with the PA it
jointly conducted a portfolio review and fact finding mission that defined the objectives and
orientations to scale up selected well-performing projects that would have a quick and
tangible impact in Gaza. Actions were agreed upon to improve portfolio performance and to
scale up selected operations.

B.            Objectives and Description

41. The objectiveof the proposedscale-up program is to help the PA to repair damage
caused by the recent escalation of conflict in Gaza, and to assist with respondingto the
needs of the poorest segments of the Palestinianpopulationin Gaza. The total cost o fthe
proposed scale-up program i s US$21.5 million, which would be financed from the TFGWB.
Since the 2008 replenishment o f US$55 million has been fully committed to three new


  A F s are the most expeditiousinstruments o f the Bank to target its resourcesto specific needs.

 operations, the remaining balance from re-flows from service charges, commitment fees,
 investment income, and project cancellations, i s available for the scale-up. In line with the
 2008-2010 I S for WB&G as well as the PA's PRDP, the proposed scale-up o f World Bank
 funded projects will be to support the immediate objective o f Gaza's recovery after the recent
 conflict in Gaza.      This is also consistent with the medium-to long-term objectives of
 Palestinian economic recovery. The PRDP will be updated within the coming 2-3 months to
 reflect the Gaza economic recovery objective.

 42. The January 2009 portfolioreview endorsed this scale up and the PA confirmedits
 request in its letter of March 30, 2009.           The proposed scale-up o f the six ongoing
 operations is a critical element o f the Bank's response to the post-crisis situation in Gaza:
     Electricity Utility Management Project (EUMP): US$2.5 m
 0   Third Emergency Services Support Project (ESSP 111): US$5 m
 0   Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation I1Project (EMSRP 11): US$3 m
     Gaza Emergency Water Project (GEWP): US$3 m
 0   PalestinianNGO 111Project (PNGOIII): US$3 m
     Tertiary Education Project (TEP): US$5 m

 43. In addition, a request was submitted for a US$5 million to scale up of the SSNRP
 usingproceedsfrom the GlobalFood Price CrisisResponseTrust Fund. This Additional
 Financing will be processed separately.

  44. The proposed additional financing to the six ongoing operations is a simple scale-
  up of successful on-going projects that are likely to contribute to Gaza's economic
  recovery. This will therefore not require any major changes to projects' basic design.
  Therefore, no ``formal" reappraisal was deemed necessary. However, since the end o f the
  hostilities in January 2009, the Bank has been carrying out "informal appraisals" o f these
  scale-ups. Project teams have been working very closely with the client to identify and
  appraise existing activities that could be scaled up immediately and that would have a
  positive and rapid effect on the lives o f the poorer segments o f the population in Gaza. The
  project teams are satisfied that all normal Bank appraisal criteria (technical, economic, and
  financial soundness and readiness for implementation) are met for activities that are scaled
  up. All activities are within the original project design and contribute to the achievement of
  the original PDOs. The fiduciary and environmental and social safeguards are analyzed inthe
  next section o f this document. Financial terms and conditions (grant terms) will also remain
  the same as in the original projects. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements for these AF
  will focus mainly on outputs. For more details about each o f the six proposed scale-ups,
  please see Annex 1.



IV. PROGRAM       IMPLEMENTATION


  A.         Procurement

  45. Procurement o f goods, works and consultants'under the AFs will be carried out in
  accordance with the `Guidelines On Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in
  Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants' known as the `2006 Anti-
  corruption Guidelines', and the `Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
  Credits' published by the Bank in May 2004 and revised in Octoher 2006 and the
   `Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers,' dated
  May 2004 and revised October 2006, and the accompanying standard bidding documents for
  any new procurement".

  46. Thresholds for procurement methods and the Bank's prior review have been
   revised to take into account the current implementing agencies capacity and the need to
  streamline procurement under the scale-up program. The revised thresholds `are detailed
   in the procurement plan annexed to each respective Project Paper.             For PNGO 111,
  procurement for scaled up demand-driven sub- grants in Gaza will follow the procurement
  arrangements set forth in the revised procurement manual to be finalized by effectiveness.
  The revision would introduce further streamlining of sub-projects procurement including a
  more simplified procedure for Small Value Procurement o f less than US$lO,OOO.

  47. Because of the emergency to rehabilitate the damaged equipment and restore the
  Gaza distribution network under the EUMP AF and given import and closure
  restrictions, the six shopping packages listed in the respective project paper will be
  allowed to exceed the shopping thresholds as reflected in the Procurement Plan. This
  exception will be subject to an explicit request by the PEA and to the clearance by the RPM
  concurrently with the submission for no objection by the Bank.


                                                  15

48. A desk review of each PIU's capacity has been conducted to assess their
procurement performance under the respective original projects and to determine the
level of urgent training to address any specific weaknesses identified during Bank's
prior or post reviews. This support will be first provided inthe form clinics (rapid response
and short duration to accompany the start up o f procurement implementation o f the scale-up
program). A comprehensive 3 days training workshop will be delivered in FYlO and will be
extendedto all PIUs and line ministriesin West Bank and Gaza.

49. To address the procurement risks associated with the emergency nature o f the scale-up
program and the sensible reduction o f Bank's prior review, all contracts below prior review
will be subject to post review as stipulated inthe respective project documents.



B.        FinancialManagement

50. The Financial Management arrangements for the proposed additional financings
will build on the already existing financial management system at the current ongoing
projects. Activities proposed will be under same categories o f current projects and will be
implementedby existing Project Coordination Units (PCU) / Project Implementation Units
(PIU). Same Financial Management arrangements (including funds flow arrangements) will
be applicable to the additional financings proposed, and will be implemented according to the
existing Financial Manual o f Procedures and the respective Grant Agreements.

5 1. The Financial Management arrangements and systems of the six projects proposed
for scale-up are deemed acceptable though four projects experience some internal
control issues but are implementing remedial action plans agreed to with the Bank.
These are the following projects: ESSP, GEWP, PNGOIII, and EMSPRII. Such action plans
include appointing internal auditors and operationnalizing the internal audit function.

52. The Financial Management risk rating will remain the same and varies between
Substantial to Moderate. Close follow up and mitigating measures are considered as deemed
appropriate for each project per the individual project write up per annex 1. Most projects
under this additional financing request have substantial financial management risk rating
mainly due to the inherent nature for the projects as fully or partially implemented in Gaza.
The Bank FM team has introduced a number of mitigating measures including the hiring a
consultant to carry out semi-annual transaction reviews, reinforcement o f controls over
expenditures, and where possible centralizing the disbursement process at the PIU / P M U
level through direct payments on behalfo f the third party recipient to contractors/suppliers in
both the West Bank and Gaza.


c.        Disbursement

53. The same Designated Accounts (DAs) for the existing financing from the Bank will
be maintained for the additional financing of each operation. An updated disbursement
plan has been prepared by the each respective PCU / PIU to reflect the amounts of additional
financing and the detailed activities that will be financed under the proposed additional
financings. The amended disbursementplans have been received by the Bank.

                                               16

 54. Separate records will be set up in the accounting system showing separately disbursed
 amounts related to each additional financing.            The same traditional disbursement
 arrangements will be used for the proposed additional financings: including the Designated
 Account, Statement o f Expenditures (SOE), full documentation, and direct payments. Given
 the project cash forecasts, there will be no need to increase DAs authorized allocation. The
 current ceilings for the ongoing projects are considered sufficient to cover both the original as
 well as the proposed additional financings.



  D.        Environment and Social Safeguards

 55. For the proposed AF operations, no additional safeguards due diligence is required
 and original safeguards instruments developed for parent projects remain appropriate.
 Inparticular the proposed AF operationswill not imply land acquisition.

 56. The potential environmental impacts of the scale-up components of the program
 are low since it only finances operating costs o f social ministries, supports rehabilitation o f
 damaged infrastructure and replacement o f damaged equipment, and no new construction i s
 anticipated.

 57. Repair and reconstruction work is not expected to have adverse social impact
 either. No activities requiring land acquisition will be financed by these scale-ups, nor any
 other safeguard related to OP4.12 will be triggered.            For category B projects, the
 rehabilitation work will be conducted on the basis o f the environmental assessments and
 resettlement policy frameworks (where applicable) already agreed within the projects,
 therefore the same principles, mitigation measures, and frameworks would apply. Ensuring
 compliance will also be facilitated by the fact that the Bank teams that are currently
 supervising the ongoing projects would also be supervising the scaled-up activities under
 these projects.



v. BENEFITSAND RISKS

 58. The scale-up program benefits would come through restoration and expansion of
 basic infrastructure and support for overstretched essential public services in
 education, health and social services. The scale-up program will build on relief and
 recovery measures already initiated by the PA, and will complement assistance provided by
 the UN, EC, private sector, non-governmental organizations and bilateral donors.

 59. Although the scale-up program is supporting sectors where experienced
 implementing agencies and established delivery mechanisms already exist, continued
 closure of Gaza is an ongoing concern for the PA, the Bank, and donor community.
 Currently, the Bank and most donors face complex requirements that affect the movement o f
 their staff, counterpart staff and project-related goods within the WB&G and through Israel.
 This is particularly acute in Gaza, where most donor-financed projects are on hold due to the
 restriction on the entry o f all but humanitarian goods. However, the Bank has so far managed



                                                 17

to sustain its projects by working closely with the Office o f the Quartet Representative to
coordinate entry o f critical goods with the GoI.

60. Bank projectsare also severely constrained by the lack of liquidity in Gaza banks.
This is a particular concern for the SSNRP and ESSP that depend upon regular cash transfers
to beneficiaries. The Palestinian Monetary Authority estimates that the banking system in
Gaza requires an injection o f over N I S 200m a month in cash to replace the cash that flows
out to pay for imports. But the Go1has not been allowing regular importation o f cash from
bank headquarters to their branches in Gaza.           In response, banks have rationed cash.
Consequently, civil servants, employees o f NGOs and donors, and many others have not been
able to withdraw their full salaries. In addition, the beneficiaries o f the cash transfer social
assistance programs have not been able to regularly access their full benefits. The cash
shortages are undermining the role o f the banking system, affecting the PA's capability to
deliver basic services and inhibiting the donors ability to respond to the need o f the poorest
segments o f the population. The Bank and the international community are continuing to
focus their collective efforts to obtain regular and predictable entry o f cash shipments into
Gaza.

61. The restrictionson entry of cash into Gaza are associated with fears that the funds
will be diverted to support armed groups or other unintended purposes. However, the
banks in WB&G are closely supervised by the Palestinian Monetary Authority, which
imposes one o f the most modern and stringent anti-money laundering systems in the world.
It is stricter than most other countries inthe region, including Israel. Because of this intense
oversight the Palestinian banks carefully monitor the flow o f funds and will not allow funds
to be diverted or funds from unknown sources to enter the system. Since all Bank funding, as
well as PA payments, pass through the formal banking system, there is minimal risk of
diversion. However, the shortage o f cash i s leading groups to avoid the formal banking
system and increasing the risk to the stability o f the banking system itself.

62. The current political environment in WB&G and in Israel presents a landscape
with a high degree of variability in the environment in which reforms and donor
assistance may take place.         As such, the primary risk is embedded in the overall
circumstances in which the Bank and others must craft their assistance programs. This has
led a considerable part o f the donor community to adapt a short-term, rapid intervention
approach. The Bank's strategy seeks to balance quick results with sustainability, with focus
on continued reliance on PA institutions that will support an eventual Palestinian state.

63. There is also a risk that relatesto the political tensions betweenthe West Bank and
Gaza and the resulting impact on PA institutions. To the extent possible, the Bank's
strategic focus on projects with simple design, and its reliance on PA institutions, local
communities, NGOs, semi-independent government entities (such as Municipal Development
Lending Fund - MDLF), and public utilities will mitigate this risk, but also provide the P A
with much-neededcontinuity.

64. Governance issues, especially potential opportunities for misappropriation of
resources, are of concern during implementation of emergency recovery programs.
However, with the strengthening o f internal control procedures the governance situation has
improved during the tenure o f the caretaker government.            The implementing agencies
involved also have a good track record in terms o f procurement and financial management.

                                                18

To further mitigate this risk a close follow up i s planned, emphasizing due diligence in
procurement and independent audits, coupled with strengthened post reviews, and periodic
reviews o f accounts and statements o f expenditure.

65. The risk Identification Matrix (annex 6) identifies the most important risks and
mitigation measures adopted in each o f the operations.          Also, the Bank's strategy o f
diversifying the types of projects it funds helps mitigate the risks o f a change in the PA
government. The bulk o f the support is directed through budget support to help strengthen
the institutions of the PA. However, the Bank also continues to support projects that can
continue to deliver services to the population in case there i s a disruption to the P A
government services.        Finally, the Bank's approach reduces risks by supporting
reconstruction in Gaza through channeling additional funding to existing programs that have
proven they can operate under the current closure conditions. This i s a less risky approach
than attempting to start new projects that might not be able to perform as well. It also reflects
that fact that the current Bank projects meet the needs o f the Gaza population.

 Annex 1:Descriptionof the Six Additional Financings


                        PROPOSED ADDITIONAL FINANCING THE        FOR
                         ELECTRIC UTILITYMANAGEMENT             PROJECT


PROJECT   HISTORY
1.   The Electric Utility Management Project (EUMP) was approved by the Bank's Board on
May 15, 2008. The project i s co-financed by other donors and the total project cost amount
to US$140.1 million with contributions from: the European Commission (US$20.0 million);
European Investment Bank (US$70.3 million); French Agency for Development (US$lO.O
million); Government o f NonvaylSIDA (US$21.5 million); the World Bank - Trust Fund for
Gaza and the West Bank (TFGWB) (US$12.0 million); and local contribution from the
PalestinianAuthority (PA) (US$6.3 million). The Trust Fund Grant Agreement (TFGA) was
signed on June 30, 2008 and once the conditions o f effectiveness were met, the project was
declared effective on September 25, 2008. All co-financiers met the co-financing deadline o f
April 1,2009.

2.   The EUMP aims to assist the PA in implementing its strategy for the electricity sector,
which focuses on reducing the fiscal burden o f the power sector, while maintaining the
security o f power supply by: (i)providing incentives to power consumers in the West Bank
to pay their electricity bills to reverse the steep decline in collections that has occurred since
early 2007; (ii)providing incentives to municipalities to pay Israel Electric Corporation Ltd.
(IEC) for their purchases o f bulk power to reverse the increase in their non-payments to IEC;
and (iii)creating new electricity utilities to take over municipal and village electricity
businesses, and place electricity supply on a commercial basis through sound sector
regulation.

PROJECT   DEVELOPMENT       OBJECTIVES
3.   The project development objective is to reduce the fiscal burdeno f the electricity sector
on the PA's budgetary resources through efficiency enhancement measures aimed at
lowering deductions from clearance revenues for arrears owed to the IEC including: (a)
improved collection performance; (b) lower technical and non-technical losses; (c) reduction
in payables to IEC on account of electricity purchases; (d) consolidation and increase in the
number of electricity consumers; and (e) ensuring that Northern Electric Distribution
Company (NEDCO) i s fully operational.           These objectives have not changed since the
declaration o f effectiveness o f the original project.

4.   The project consists o f three components: (a) supply and installation o f power supply
sub-stations; (b) development, reconfiguration and rehabilitation o f distribution networks;
and (c) capacity buildingfor the improvement o f electricity services.

CURRENT PROJECT STATUSAND MONITORING
5.   Disbursement is yet to start. Procurement process has been initiated and two packages
(totaling about US$3.6 million) have already been cleared and procurement process initiated.
Since effectiveness in September 2008, the overall project performance has been satisfactory


                                                 20

and all co-financing arrangements have been finalized.          The current ISR ratings are
satisfactory and the project i s in substantial compliance with the legal covenants. The first
progress report covering all project activities until the period up to June 30, 2009 will be
submittedwithin 45 days o fthe end ofthe reporting period Le., by August 15,2009.

PA'SREQUESTFORADDITIONAL FINANCING PROPOSEDUSEOF FUNDS
                                                AND

6.    Through a letter to the Bank dated March 30, 2009, the PA requested for additional
financing (AF) to help the recovery efforts in Gaza. With the onset o f the recent conflict in
Gaza, the electricity distribution network owned and operated by the Gaza Electric
Distribution Company (GEDCO) suffered severe damages that are estimated at US$10.4
million. These damages to GEDCO's network have no impact on the other distribution
utilities in the West Bank. Although electricity supply to the people o f Gaza has been
restored by using spare parts available at the Palestinian Electric Authority's (PEA) stores
and by fixing the damaged network, the effort i s both temporary and not sustainable over the
long-term. The P A i s expected to receive about US$2.0 million in grant assistance from
Norway, Sweden and the European Commission, and has requested the additional financing
from the Bank for US$2.5 million to carry out urgent rehabilitation o f the damaged network.
Specifically, the additional financing will be used to procure essential distribution equipment
for GEDCO to rehabilitate the damaged equipment and to restore the Gaza distribution
network to ensure that it operates in a technically stable manner. The equipment to be
procured under the AF will mainly consist o f distribution transformers, aluminum/copper
conductors, poles and accessories. This would fall under component Part 2 (2) o f Schedule 1
o f the TFGA (rehabilitation and extension o f the distribution networks in the utilities in the
West Bank and Gaza). Usingthe details o f allocation o f Grant proceeds as defined in Section
IV o f Schedule 2 of the TFGA, the allocation and estimated annual disbursement projections
o f the project includingthe additional financing are included inAttachment 1.

PROPOSEDCHANGES FOR THE AF
7.    The additional financing project will have the same design, objective and scope as that
o f the original project.      The project's implementation, financial management and
disbursement arrangements will remain the same. The procurement arrangement will also
follow the original project, with some the changes that are described in the procurement
section below. Inview o f the urgency o f rehabilitating the network, the materials needed will
be procured under Shoppingprocedures as provided for in Section I11(B)(2) o f Schedule 2 o f
the TFGA. These materials can be categorized under the distribution component and are to
be added to Component 2 (d) o f Annex 5 o f the Project Appraisal Document o f the original
project.   The project was developed under OPBP 8.0 and no "formal" reappraisal was
deemed necessary. However, since the end o f the Gaza conflict in January 2009, the project
team has carried out an intensive supervision o f the original project as well as an "informal
appraisal."

SAFEGUARDS
8.    All project sites have been investigated by the safeguards team.              N o known
archaeological or historical sites would be affected by the rehabilitation activities that are
proposed to be financed out o f this additional financing. Accordingly, and as the activities
are a continuation to those initiated under the original project and no new project sites are
envisaged, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), Environmental Management Plan

                                                21

(EMP) and the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) which were completed on April 2,
2008 as part o f the Project preparation are still valid. Each o f the EIA, EMP and RPF are
available on file within the World Bank's Infoshop.

PROCUREMENTARRANGEMENTS
9.   Procurement under this additional financing will be carried out in accordance with the
'Guidelines On Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants' known as the '2006 Anti-Corruption Guidelines',
and the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated
May 2004, revised in October 2006; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, revised in October 2006, and the
accompanying standard bidding documents.

10. The thresholds for procurement methods and Bank's Prior Review are detailed in the
AF-specific Procurement Plan and included in Attachment-2; this will need to be approved
by negotiations.

11. Because o f the urgency to rehabilitate the damaged equipment and to restore the Gaza
distribution network and given the import and closure restrictions, the following six shopping
packages will be allowed to exceed the thresholds for shopping as reflected in the
Procurement Plan. These exceptions will be subject to an explicit request by the PEA and to
the clearance by the Regional Procurement Manager (RPM) concurrently with the
submission for no objection by IDA for the following:

        The shopping purchase for the Supply o f Distribution Transformers for GEDCO in
        the amount o f US$500,000;
    0   The shopping purchase for the Supply of ABC cables for GEDCO in the amount of
        US$420,000;
        The shopping purchase for the Supply o f Conductors and Switch Disconnectors for
        GEDCO inthe amount o f US$685,000;
        The shopping purchase for the Supply o f Wooden Poles for GEDCO inthe amount o f
        US$250,000;
        The shopping purchase for the Supply o f Steel Poles for GEDCO in the amount o f
        US$300,000;
        The shopping purchase for the Supply o f Clamps, Fittings and Accessories for
        GEDCO inthe amount o f US$345,000;

FINANCIALMANAGEMENT          AND DISBURSEMENT     ARRANGEMENTS:
12. The project objectives o f the AF will remain the same as for the original project.
Activities proposed will be under the same categories as for the original project, and will be
implemented by the existing PMU.         The Financial Management arrangements for the
additional financing project will build on the already existing financial management system
at the original project.   Same financial management arrangements (including funds flow
arrangements) will be applicable to the additional financing, and will be implemented
according to the existing Financial Section o f the Manual o f Procedures and, the Grant
Agreement.



                                              22

13. Current FM Risk Rating o f the Project: The overall financial management risk of the
original project i s considered Substantial due the project structure which i s to provide support
to the electricity companies in both West Bank and Gaza. Mitigating measures have been
introduced and are in place. These include centralizing the disbursement process at the P M U
level through direct payments on behalf o f the electricity companies to contractodsuppliers
in both the West Bank and Gaza. FMrisk after adoption of mitigatingmeasures is expected
to be Moderate.

14. Additional details on Financial Management and Disbursement arrangements are
included in Attachment 3. A complete list of materials proposed to be procured for GEDCO
under this additional financing project is included inAttachment 4.

LEGAL    AGREEMENT- DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ORIGINAL PROJECT AND ADDITIONAL
FINANCING

15. A new trust fund grant agreement will be prepared for the additional financing project.
It will reflect the additional financing amount of US$2.5 million, including an updated
disbursement table (Attachment 1). The Grant Closing Date will be the same as that o f the
original project Le., September 30, 2013. The new Standard Conditions o f July 1, 2008 will
apply to the TFGA, and the additional procedures for N C B in the procurement section will be
updated. Inall other respects it i s expected that the TFGA for the additional financing will be
the same as the original project's TFGA (except for updated definitions, as required by the
changes described above). The effectiveness conditions included new subsidiary agreements,
a legal opinion and the updated manual o f procedures.

REVISED PERFORMANCE        INDICATORS   AND EXPECTEDOUTCOMES

16. Since the additional financing i s only meant for restorationh-ehabilitation o f damaged
networks for GEDCO, no impact on performance indicators o f other distribution utilities is
envisaged.   Revision to the performance targets o f GEDCO can only be made after the
repairsh-ehabilitation works are completed. Therefore, the performance indicators, presented
inthe original project will remain the same; these are included inAttachment 5.

               FinancialManagementandDisbursementArrangements



Current FM Performance of the Project:               Project had a satisfactory FM system,
computerized accounting system is in place (Oracle), supported with acceptable Financial
Manual o f Procedures. FM staff is adequate to the project FM needs, and has the sufficient
experience. Internal and External Audit arrangements are in place.

DisbursementPlan; An updated disbursement plan has been prepared by the P M Uto reflect
the amounts of additional financing and the detailed activities that will be financed under the
proposed additional financing. The amended disbursement plan i s included in Attachment 1.
A complete list of materials proposed to be procured for GEDCO under the additional
financing is included in Attachment 5.

Disbursement Arrangements: The same Designated Account (DA) for the existing
financing from World Bank will be used for the additional financing. Separate records will
be set up in the accounting system showing separately disbursed amounts related to each
additional financing.    Same disbursement arrangements will be used for the additional
financing; this will include the use o f traditional disbursement methods including the use o f
DA, Statement of Expenditures (SOE), full documentation, and direct payments. Based on
the disbursement needs and the quarterly disbursement plan submitted, the current DA
ceiling is considered sufficient to cover the short term cash needs o f both the ongoing and
the additional financing project. There i s no needto increase the ceiling o f the DA.

Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) Arrangements for the Additional Financings: The
current reporting arrangements are satisfactory and will be extended to the additional
financing. Hence, IFRs for the additional financing will be part of the existing project IFRs,
with separate reporting related to existing as well as the additional financing. IFRs will be
prepared and submitted to the Bank on a 6-monthly basis by no later than 45 days after the
end o f the previous semester.

Audit Arrangementsfor theAdditional Financing: As is the case for the parent project, the
additional financing will be subject to an annual independent external audit. With the
additional financing, the current project audit arrangements will be extended to the
additional financing to cover all funding under the project. The Project's financial
statements (including the additional financing) will be audited annually by an independent
external auditor acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with internationally accepted auditing
standards and terms o f reference cleared by the Bank. Additional financing and original
financing funded by the Bank to be reported separately by the auditor. The audit report will
be sent to the Bank no later than six (6) months following the closing o f the fiscal year.

Supervision: As is the case for the ongoing project, the financial supervision activities will
include inter-alia, SOEs review, review o f semi-annual Interim Financial Reports (IFRs),
review o f annual audited financial statements and management letters as well as timely
follow up on issues raised by the auditor.         There will be four financial management
supervisions during the first year o f activities and twice a year from the second year
onwards.

                                                                    3


PROJECT    HISTORY
1.   The Emergency Services Support Project (ESSP) became effective in 2002. It was
designed to rapidly channel Bank resources to fund top priority recurrent expenditures in the
social sectors in West Bank and Gaza. At the request o f donors, in 2006, the Bank began
administering a multi-donor trust fund for the ESSP. Since 2002, the Bank and donors have
provided over $240 millionthrough ESSP 1 and ESSP 2*, and the on-going third phase o f the
ESSP (ESSP 3). A US$10 million grant from the Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank
(TFGWB) was approved for the ESSP 3 by the Bank's Board of Directors on December 13,
2007. The ESSP 3 (original project) became effective in March 24,2008.

PROJECT    DEVELOPMENT        OBJECTIVES
2.   The ESSP 3 project objective is to mitigate the deterioration ofthe delivery o f education,
health and social care services to the Palestinian population in parts of the West Bank and
Gaza under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority (PA). The project objective has not
changed since the ESSP 3 became effective. The ESSP 3 has four components, consisting o f
support to: (a) the Ministry o f Education and Higher Education (MOEHE) for educational
services, (b) the Ministry o f Health (MOH) for health services, (c) the Ministry o f Social
Affairs (MOSA) for social welfare services and (d) project management and monitoring by
financing project management staff, operating costs and audits and short term consultancies
to strengthen the capacity of the Project Coordination Unit, and MOEHE,MOH and MOSA.

CURRENT PROJECTSTATUSAND MONITORING

3.   The ESSP is a Palestinian mechanism that can be quickly scaled up during crisis
situations to continue to fund recurrent expenditures in key social service delivery sectors o f
health, education and social services. The ESSP has a proven track record o f maintaining
key social service facilities (such as hospitals and schools) operational during crisis
situations. This includes the recent Gaza hostilities, whereby the ESSP continued to provide
fuel to health facilities, using the services o f the International Committee o f the Red Cross
(ICRC) that enabled hospital generators to continue functioning in a situation where multiple
casualties needed to be treated at the same time. Services funded through the ESSP benefit,
to a large extent, the poor segments o f the Palestinianpopulation, especially in Gaza, who do
not have money to seek private health care or send their children to private schools.

4.   Since ESSP 3 effectiveness a year ago, over US$6 million has been disbursed. The
remaining $4 million has been committed and is expected to be disbursed by end August
2009.

5.   The ESSP 3 is a pure emergency operation. M&E will continue to focus on project
outputs. The project continues to meet its intended objective o f mitigating the deterioration o f
social services. The PA began and will continue to measure the extent to which social
services operate at the same levels as the 2007 baselines which were set for health, education,
and social services. The project i s doing remarkably well, taking into account the Gaza

 ESSP 1 closing date December 2004; ESSP 2 closing date June 2005

                                                     31

situation as education, health, and social services continue to operate around the same levels
as the 2007 baselines. Assistance through the ESSP 3 also remains steady for support to
vulnerable groups (women, youth, and disabled).                        Preliminary information indicates that
there have been no changes in the number o f public schools operating. Since effectiveness,
the project has been rated satisfactory for implementation performance and for achievement
o f project development objectives.                  Compliance with the legal covenants has been
satisfactory.       Quarterly spot audit reports are carried out to verify whether services were
rendered and goods actually received on the sites. The quarterly report for the period ending
September 30, 2008 was received. The receipt o f the quarterly report for the December 31,
2008 period was delayed for over a month due to the Gaza closure, but was eventually
received midMarch 2009.

6. Financing gap: Expected donor financing has not materialized, in a timely manner,
especially in Gaza and therefore there i s a funding gap. This AF will help close a portion of
this gap and fund much needed recurrent expenditures for Gaza, where most of the AF
resources will be channeled. Health, education, and social sector facilities are in great need
o f these resources, as they require adequate provisions o f fuel and other basic necessities to
ensure the operational continuity o f hospitals under the direst circumstances, such as the
recent power outages in Gaza that went on for days.

PA'SREQUESTFORADDITIONAL FINANCING PROPOSEDUSEOFFUNDS       AND
7.    In order to do so, the PA requested that the Bank provide an additional US$5.0 million
grant from the Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank to support part o f the PA's emergency
recurrent expenditure needs in the social sectors for 2009. The proposed AF would fund
operating costsg for the MOEHE, the MOH, and the MOSA and the AF would also partially
fund recurrent expenditures that are essential to ensure that these public facilities can remain
operational. Line ministries' administrative practices for the provision o f the services to be
rendered through ESSP financing were reviewed and were found to be acceptable by the
Bank.

8.    The AF will have the following three components for a total cost o f US$5 million from
the TFGWB

      Component 1: Education Services: Will support the MOEHE for the delivery of
      educational services, through: (i)the financing o f recurrent expenditures o f MOHEEand
      school directorates; (ii) the financing o f the cost o f general examinations, including
      stationary, printing, and per diem expenses for examination monitors and reviewers; and
      (iii)thesupportingofhighereducationinstitutions, throughpaymentofsalaries ofnon-
      civil servant teaching staff.

      Component2: Health Services: This component will provide support to MOH for the
      delivery o f health services through the financing o f recurrent non-medical expenditures


9Operating costs will include: (a) rent payments for offices and facilities; (b) water and electricity utilities; (c)
  transportation includingfuel,vehicle maintenance, licensing and insurance; (d) communication, including
  telephones, fax and mail; (e) consumable and other perishable items; (f) maintenance o f equipment and buildings; (g)
  heating fuel; (h) cleaning services; (i) advertisements costs solely related to procurement under the project; (j)
  commercial bank charges; and (i)per diem and transportation allowances for MOEHE, MOH, MOSA, and PCU staff
  for activities directly related to the project.

                                                           32

     o f MOH and health facilities. The AF will not finance the contracted health services or
     any specialized medical treatment in private and non-governmental hospitals which
     continue to be financed under the original project.

     Component 3: Social WerfareServices: this component will provide support to MOSA
     for the delivery o f social care services, through the financing o f recurrent expenditures
     o f MOSA, and its shelters, rehabilitation and training centers.

     The AF will not finance project management and monitoring (component 4 of the
     original project) namely the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) in the Ministry o f Finance
     and its incremental operating and audit costs. This components will continue to be
     funded under the originalproject.

PROPOSEDCHANGESFOR THE AF
9.   The AF will have the same project design and project objective of the original project
but as set out above the AF will only funds some components ofthe original project. This AF
will help close a portion of the financing gap.     Hence, the AF's implementation, financial
management and disbursement arrangements will be the same as for the original project. The
new operating budget has been approved by the Bank. The audit for this AF will be funded
using proceeds o f the original project. The AF will not have a new disbursement letter and
the same Designated Accounts under the original project will be continue to be used for the
AF. The closing date will be December 31, 2010. The proposed AF was developed under
OP/BP 8.0 and no "formal" reappraisal was deemed necessary. However, since the end o f
the Gaza conflict in January 2009, the Bank's team based in the field has been working in
close collaboration with the Ministry o f Finance and the other line ministries to define the
content and orientations o f this proposed AF.

LEGAL    AGREEMENT- DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ORIGINAL PROJECT AND ADDITIONAL
FINANCING
10. A new trust fund grant agreement will be prepared for the AF. It will reflect the
additional amount o f US$5 million, including a revised disbursement table. The closing date
will be December 31,2010.       Since the task team and procurement team have confirmed that
no procurement i s envisaged under this AF, there will be no procurement provisions in the
trust fund grant agreement. The new Standard Conditions of July 1, 2008 will apply to the
trust fund grant agreement. In all other respects, it is expected that the trust fund grant
agreement for the Additional Financing will be the same as the original project's trust fund
grant agreement..
The effectiveness conditions will include a revised subsidiary agreement and a legal opinion.

11. Procurement arrangements: No procurement is expected under this AF as all the
proceeds will mainly fund operating costs for Ministries o f Education, Higher Education,
Health, and Social Affairs. The audit for this AF will be funded usingproceeds o f the original
project

SAFEGUARDS
12 The project was categorized as category C. This is a quick disbursing operation covering
recurrent costs in the social sectors. There are no safeguards instruments attached to the on-

                                                33

going ESSP 3 or this proposed AF. The ESSP 3 and the AF are not expected to have any
significant environmental or social impact.           There is no likelihood o f involuntary
resettlement, and land acquisition i s not expected. Confirmation was obtained from the
safeguards unit that the proposed changes do not affect any safeguards issues, and therefore
the ISDS will not need to be updated.


FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT           AND DISBURSEMENT     ARRANGEMENTS
13. Activities proposed will be funded under the same disbursement categories as for the
on-going project.       Implementation arrangements will remain the same.             Financial
management arrangements will build on the on-going project's current financial management
system. The same financial management arrangements (including funds flow arrangements)
will apply and will be implementedaccording to existing financial procedures and the Trust
FundGrant Agreement.

14. The overall financial management risk o f the ongoing project is considered substantial
due to the project structure and the fact that four line ministries will be implementing project
activities. There are on-going discussions between the Bank and the PA regarding the
improvement o f some internal control issues coupled with the limited supervision by Bank
fiduciary staff o f activities carried out in Gaza. Mitigating measures have been introduced to
improve internal controls, including hiring a consultant to carry out semi-annual transaction
reviews and reinforcement o f controls over expenditures. As a result o f the introduction of
these risk mitigating measures, the financial management risk i s expected to be moderate.

15. The revised disbursement schedule is in Attachment 1. Detailed financial management
arrangements are described in Attachment 3.

REVISED PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND EXPECTEDOUTCOMES
16. The monitoring indicators will remain the same as for the underlying project using the
2007 year as the baseline year. M&E arrangements for this proposed AF will continue to
focus on project outputs given the emergency nature o f the ESSP. For education services, the
number of primary public schools operating and number of students attending those schools,
per school, compared to the September 2007 baseline will be monitored. For health services,
utilization rates (overall, outpatient, and gynecology) in Shefaa and Rafedia hospitals,
compared to a baseline set in September 2007 will be monitored. For social services, the
number of facilities (training centers, youth centers and disabled rehabilitation centers) that

                            FinancialManagement Arrangements

Financial Management (FM)).The project objectives and components o f the proposed
Additional Financing (AF) will remain the same as in the original financing for the ESSP 3.
Activities proposed will be funded under the same disbursement categories as for the on-
going project and will be implemented by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in the
Ministry o f Finance (MOF).          Financial Management arrangements for this proposed
additional financing will build upon the on-going project's current financial management
system. The same financial management arrangements (including funds flow arrangements)
will apply to this proposed AF, and will be implemented according to existing financial
procedures and the Trust FundGrant Agreement.

The ESSP 3 i s designed to have three designated accounts established under the MOF Central
Treasury Account (CTA) and managed by the MOF (for M O F and the Ministry o f Social
Affairs (MOSA) parts), MOH, and MOEHE respectively. These three designated accounts
are maintained in West Bank commercial Banks and are managed by the MOF, the MOH,
and MOEHE in the West Bank.             The MOF PCU will be responsible for accounting,
recording, and reporting o f all transactions related to the ESSP 3 AF on behalf o f all line
ministries. Furthermore, the MOF PCU will review withdrawal applications submitted by
MOHand MOEHEbefore these are sent Bank.

The concerned line ministries in the West Bank will be required to keep proper and separate
records and accounts o f project transactions. These line ministries will archive all original
invoices, contracts, vouchers and payment orders.          The PCU will file copies o f these
documents at the MOF inthe West Bank.

Current FM Performance of the ESSP 3. FM performance on reporting and auditing has
been satisfactory. Annual audits and quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) were
received on time and are satisfactory to the Bank. The auditor expressed an unqualified
opinion on 2007 the audit report. The auditor also issued a management letter indicating no
major weaknesses inthe internal control system. Internal and external audit arrangements are
in place. The PCU was assessed as adequate and has acceptable FM arrangements. A
computerized accounting system i s inplace (Bisan).

The Bank latest supervision and reviewmission for the ESSP Multi-donor Trust Fund
(MDTF) (which is being implemented intandem with the Bank funded ESSP 3) highlighted
certain internal control weaknesses. The Bank will prepare an action plan for the MOF PCU
to implement to remedy these weaknesses. The Bank's FMteam will work with the MOF
PCU to ensure that the action plan i s implemented. The main findings o f this review are:
archiving shortcomings in the MOF inthe West Bank - it was difficult and time consuming
to retrieve documents from the MOF archiving system. The Bank's team recommends having
a separate archiving system for the ESSP accounts that would be directly linked to the project
accounting records.-The review has not yet been finalized. Upon completion, a detailed
report will be shared with counterparts for review and feedback comments. Based on the
initial observations o f the review, additional preventive actions were added to the FM
arrangements.

Disbursement plan: The disbursement plan was updated to reflect projected disbursements
for this proposed AF.

Disbursement arrangements. The same Designated Accounts (DA) and disbursement
arrangements for the on-going ESSP 3 will be used for this AF. Separate records will be set
up in the accounting system showing separately the amounts disbursed for this proposed AF.
World Bank traditional disbursement methods will apply, including the use o f Special
Accounts, Statement o f Expenditures (SOE), full documentation, and direct payments. Based
on the assessment made for disbursement needs o f the project, the current DA ceilings are
considered sufficient to cover the short term cash needs under both the ongoing project and
the AF. The ceiling o f the DAs will, therefore, remain unchanged.

Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) arrangements for this proposed AF.                The current
reporting arrangements are satisfactory and will be extended to the additional financing.
Hence, IFRs for this proposed AF will be part o f the existing project IFRs, with separate
reporting for the on-going ESSP 3 and this proposed AF. IFRs will be prepared and will be
submitted to the Bank no later than 45 days after the end o f each calendar quarter.

Quarterly spot check audit. The current spot check auditing arrangements will also apply for
the proposed ESSP 3 AF. The quarterly spot check audit report will also be submittedto the
Bank no later than 45 days after the end o f each calendar quarter. Terms o f reference o f the
external audit includes more details regarding the scope and methodology o f the spot check
audits.

As is the case for the ongoing project, the additional financing will be subject to an annual
independent external audit. The on-going auditing arrangements will be extended to this
proposed AF. The financial statements (including those for this proposed AF) will be audited
annually by an independent external auditor acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with
internationally accepted auditing standards and terms o f reference acceptable to the Bank.
Additional financing and original financing funded by the Bank will be reported separately
by the auditor. The audit report will be sent to the Bank no later than six (6) months
following the closing o f the fiscal year.

Supervision.    As is the case for the ongoing project, regular supervision of project
implementation will be carried out by a full team o f specialists. This will include the task
team leader, fiduciary specialists (financial management and procurement), as well as any
other experts as circumstances might require. Interms o f financial supervision, activities will
include inter-alia, SOE reviews, reviews o f semi-annual Interim Financial Reports (IFRs),
reviews o f annual audited financial statements and management letters as well as timely
follow up on issues raised by the auditor. In addition, a financial management consultant will
carry out semi-annual SOE reviews to ensure that expenses reimbursed on the basis o f SOE
transactions are in compliance with the Grant Agreement.

                       PROPOSED ADDITIONAL FINANCING THE       FOR
            EMERGENCY      MUNICIPAL   SERVICES REHABILITATIONPROJECT  I1

PROJECT   HISTORY
1.  The Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation ii was approved by the Bank Board
on December, 19, 2006 for a total amount o f US$lO.O million (from the TFGWB) and
became effective on February 28, 2007. The current closing date is June 30, 2009. The total
funding envelope for EMSRP I1is US$42.17 million: parallel financing by the Netherlands
(US$6.17 million, closing February 2009) and KfW (US$2 1 million, closing in September
2011) and co-financing by Sweden for US$5 million, closing on June 30,2009.

PROJECT   DEVELOPMENT      OBJECTIVES
2.  The main objectives o f EMSRP I1are to:
    9       provide assistance for mitigating further deterioration in the deliver o f essential
            municipal services in the West Bank and Gaza (WB&G);
    ii)     create temporaryjob opportunities at the local level; and
    iii) promote pilot innovative initiatives that foster collaboration among local
            governments and NGOs and promote municipal cost recovery.

3.  The EMSRPII consists o f three components: (1) Emergency Municipal Services
Assistance Grants for rehabilitation, reconstruction and upgrading o f deteriorating and
damaged municipal infrastructure and facilities and supply o f equipment to sustain municipal
service provision; financing o f non-wage budgetary support, including expenses for fuel,
equipment spare parts, electricity bills for street lighting and other related direct costs for
provision o f essential municipal services. (2) Labor intensive Employment Generation to
support temporary job creation in various sectors o f the economy identified and implemented
by municipalities in coordination with local community groups. (3) Innovation Window to
install pre-paid metering systems to enhance local cost recovery for electricity service
provision and financing collaborative sub projects between municipalities and NGOs. (4)
Project Management costs to fund management fees for the Municipal Development and
Lending Fund (MDLF) and technical assistance and training for project implementation,
carrying out o f environmental and social safeguards, financial management, procurement
matters, and monitoring and evaluation activities.

CURRENT PROJECT STATUS AND MONITORING

4.  As o f April 1 2009, about US$9.7 million of the US$lO.O million grant has been
disbursed. Sub-projects in the West Bank have been fully completed at a total cost o f
US$5,063,963.     In Gaza, approximately 75% o f projects have been completed.               The
comparatively slower rate o f progress in Gaza i s due to the unavailability o f materials, spare
parts and the shortage in fuel supply and the impacts o f the most recent conflict in Gaza. The
project's implementation progress and development objective ratings over the past twelve
months have been moderately satisfactory to satisfactory. All safeguards and legal covenants
were met satisfactorily.

PA'SREQUESTFORADDITIONAL FINANCING PROPOSEDUSEOFFUNDS
                                               AND

5.  Inits letter of March 30,2009, the PA has requested US$3 million from Bank budget for
assistance to the EMSRPII based on the Gaza Early Recovery and Reconstruction Plan as

                                               40

well as the municipal sector assessment conducted by the MDLF, to help the recovery efforts
in Gaza.    The municipal sectoral assessment estimated the infrastructural damages at
approximately US$46 million and also highlighted that municipalities are unable to cover
their service costs due to their inability to collect user fees, licenses and taxes resulting from
the economic crisis. The needs for immediate (12 month period) recovery were estimated at
US$13 million. Denmark (US$5 million) and possibly Sweden have agreed to make
additional donor contributions and will enter a co-financing arrangement with the Bank under
which the Bank will administer funds under a recipient-executed trust fund. Such amounts
would be expected to be allocated towards the same components as the Additional Financing
from the TFGWB.

6.   The objectives for the Additional Financing (AF) will remain the same as in the original
project. A legal amendment to EMSRPII signed on October 7, 2008 dropped financing o f
pre-paid electricity meters following the PA's policy o f devolving electricity service
provision from municipalities to utilities. The pilots financing municipal-NGO collaboration
will not be scaled-up under the AF, in order to prioritize the most successful aspects o f
EMSRPIIas described below.

7.   The AF will finance the following three components for a total cost of US$ 3 million
from the TFGWB.

     Component 1: Emergency Municipal Services Assistance Grants: This component
     will finance (a) rehabilitation, reconstruction and upgrading o f deteriorating and
     damaged municipal infrastructure and facilities, supply o f equipment for municipal
     service provision, and financing o f non-wage budgetary support, including expenses for
     fuel, equipment spare parts, electricity bills for street lighting and other related direct
     costs for provision o f essential municipal services.           This will include financing
     incremental operating costs (non-wage recurrent expenditures) to sustain essential
     municipal services and rehabilitating some municipal assets critical for service delivery
     which were damaged as a result o f the most recent conflict escalation.

     Component 2: Labor-intensive Employment Generation: This component will
     finance support for labour-intensive temporary employment sub-projects (job creation)
     in various sectors of the economy.            These sub-projects will be identified and
     implementedby municipalities in coordination with local community groups. Under the
     original project, funds were earmarked for municipalities on the basis o f the
     unemployment index o f the Governorate in order to ensure that localities with the
     greatest need o f assistance would receive a greater share. Given the uniformly high
     unemployment rates throughout the Gaza Strip and the lack o f solid data on
     unemployment, this allocation method would be dropped from the Additional Financing.
     Instead, all municipalities will be eligible for these grants. The Operations Manual will
     be updated, prior to effectiveness, to reflect this change. As in the Original project,
     proposed activities would need to ensure a minimum o f 50 % labor content.

     Component 3: Project Management: Management fees for the Municipal Development
     and LendingFund(MDLF): 7 % o f the grant will cover the MDLF's management costs.
     The Project Management Component under the original project included Technical
     Assistance (TA) through Local Technical Consultants but this will not be scaled up


                                                41

     under the AF. Drawing on the experience on EMSRPII, closer monitoring and support
     from the MDLF i s more effective given the emergency nature o f the assistance.

8.   A total o f US$ 2.79 million from the TFGWB will be allocated to all 25 municipalities
in the Gaza Strip, based on population, consistent with the method applied in the original
project and described in the Operations Manual. The remaining US$ 0.21 million from the
TFWBG will cover management costs, including technical assistance by the MDLF to
municipalities. The allocations for municipalities will be made in one project cycle since the
AF is intendedas support to municipalities in Gaza to recover from the impacts of the recent
escalation o f the conflict in Gaza operations. Municipalities will submit subproject proposals
on the basis o f a positive list o f eligible activities focusing on service provision as well as
additional criteria (technical, economic, financial, social and environmental) identified in the
Operations Manual. The MDLF i s responsible for project appraisal. Experience o f EMSRPII
implementation in Gaza has highlighted the need to remain highly flexible and simplify the
subproject application process, especially given continuous crisis environment in which
municipalities operate. As a result, the subproject application form will be simplified and
included in the revised Operations Manual to be submittedto the Bank prior to effectiveness.
Inthe interest of maintaining flexibility, the AF will not earmark the funding amounts for the
grand total o f each o f the two components. In other words, municipalities will determine the
percentage o f their allocations that will go for each component based on priority service
provision and implementation feasibility (following the subproject cycle and selection
methodology described inthe Operations Manual).

PROPOSEDCHANGES FORTHE

9. The original project was designed as an emergency operation which was largely demand
driven. Subprojects were identified and proposed by municipalities through a process o f
community consultation. The AF i s a simple scale up o f the most successful aspects o f the
Original project, focusing on direct municipal service provision, designed to ensure a rapid
and effective impact on Gaza's population overall and especially on its poorer segments. It
will also increase the MDLF management fee from 5% to 7% to enable it to provide technical
assistance to municipalities, rather than delegating that task to the local technical consultants
as had been the practice under the original project. The revision i s based on an analysis o f
the actual costs born by MDLF in providing technical assistance to municipalities while
implementing EMSRPII.          The management fee was based on a thorough assessment o f
MDLF'soperating costs and a fully costed out budgetpresented to and agreed with the Bank.
Based on a number o f intensive supervision missions since the end o f the Gaza conflict in
January 2009, it was concluded that the AF will not require any major changes to the
project's basic design.


SAFEGUARDS
10. The supervision missions also included a review o f the safeguards aspects o f the project.
Under the original project OP 4.01 (Environment Assessment) was triggered and accordingly
and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared and disclosed under the original
project. The client has an environmental specialist who i s responsible for following up the
implementation o f the EMP and implementation i s satisfactory. The EMP remains valid.
The supervision missions also confirmed that the Bank's social safeguards policy (OP 4.12

                                                42

on involuntary resettlement) will not be triggered. Any investments that will involve
involuntary resettlement or the acquisition of land will be ineligible as described in the
Operations Manual and EMP which places such interventionson a negative list. In addition,
project design does not allow for new construction. Eligible activities are repair of existing
infrastructurerelatedto direct service deliver. The maintypes of works that are anticipated
are repairofexistingdamagedroads, street lightingnetworks etc.

FINANCIAL   MANAGEMENT      AND DISBURSEMENT     ARRANGEMENTS

11. Activities proposed will be under same categories as under the current ongoingproject,
and will be implementedby the same entity, the MunicipalDevelopmentand LendingFund
(MDLF). The FinancialManagement arrangements for the proposedAF will buildup on the
already existing financial management system.           The same Financial Management
arrangements (including arrangements for flow of funds) will be applicable to the additional
financing proposed, and will be implementedaccording to the existing FinancialManual of
Procedures and its corresponding Grant Agreement. Additional details on Financial
Management and Disbursement arrangements are includedinAttachment 1.

12. Current FM Risk Rating of the Project. The overall financial management risk o f the
ongoing project is considered Substantial due the project structure; providing support to
Municipalities in both West Bank and Gaza. Mitigatingmeasures have been introducedand
in place, which include centralizing the disbursement process at the MDLF level through
direct payments on behalf of the Municipalities to contractorshppliers in both the West
Bank and Gaza.FMrisk after mitigatingmeasures is expected to be Moderate.

                FinancialManagementandDisbursementArranpements


Financial Management Activities proposed under the AF will be under the same categories
o f current projects, and will be implemented by same entity Municipal Development and
Lending Fund (MDLF).          The Financial Management arrangements for the proposed
additional financing will build up on the already existing financial management system. The
same Financial Management arrangements (including arrangements for flow o f funds) will be
applicable to the additional financing proposed, and will be implemented according to the
existingFinancial Manual o f Procedures and its corresponding Grant Agreement.

Current FM Performance of the Project MDLF has adequate FM arrangements with
acceptable computerized accounting system (Oracle) and an acceptable Financial Procedures
Manual. The quarterly IFRs and annual audit reports for the on-going project (including the
2007 audit report) were submitted on time. The auditor issued an unqualified opinion to the
2007 audit report. Based on the review o f the 2007 Audit Report, the Bank raised comments
and recommended amendments to the Annual Audit Report o f 2007 and requested the auditor
to submit a revised audit report, which were received and considered satisfactory by the
Bank. The audit process covering the year 2008 has already been initiated. The annual audit
report covering the year ending 2008 is expected to be received before the due date o f June
30, 2009. MDLF is currently in the process o f recruitingan internal auditor for the MDLF, as
a response to implement Bank action plan proposed to operationalize the internal audit
function.

Disbursement Plan An updated disbursement plan was prepared by the MDLF to reflect the
amounts o f additional financing and the detailed activities that will be financed under the
proposed additional financing.

Disbursement Arrangements The same Designated Account for the existing financing from
World Bank will be used for the AF. Separate records will be set up in the accounting
system showing separately disbursed amounts related to each AF. Same disbursement
arrangements will be used for the proposed AF, using traditional disbursement methods
including the use o f Special Account, Statement o f Expenditures (SOE), full documentation,
and direct payments. Based on the disbursement needs o f the project and the quarterly
disbursement plan submitted, the current DA ceiling are considered sufficient to cover the
short term cash needs under both the ongoing and the additional financing o f the project.
There is no need to increase the ceiling o f the DA to reflect the additional financing; the DA
ceiling will remain the same as in the ongoing project.

Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) The current reporting arrangements are satisfactory and
will be extended to the additional financing. Hence, IFRs will be prepared and submittedto
the Bank on a quarterly basis no later than 45 days after the end of the previous quarter.




                                               45

Audit Arrangements As is the case for the ongoing project, the additional financing will be
subject to an annual independent external audit. With the additional financing, the current
audit arrangements will be extended to the additional financing to cover all funding under the
project. The Project's financial statements (including the AF) as well as the MDLF's
consolidated Financial Statements will be audited annually by an independent external
auditor acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with internationally accepted auditing
standards and terms o f reference cleared by the Bank. AF and original financing funded by
the Bank will be reported separately by the auditor. The audit reports will be sent to the
Bank no later than six (6) months following the closing o f the fiscal year.

Supervision As is the case for the ongoing project, financial supervision activities will
include inter-alia, review o f SOEs, review o f quarterly interim financial reports, review o f
annual audited financial statements and management letters as well as timely follow up on
issues raised by the auditor. There will be two financial management supervisions each year
duringthe two years o f project implementation. The Bank supervision will consist of visits to
MDLF and a sample of eligible Municipalities receiving grant funds. They will cover a
review o f FM practices, procurement methods, payment procedures and documentation to
ensure consistent and efficient application o f the financial management system.

PROJECT    HISTORY
The Gaza Emergency Water Project (GEWP), funded out o f the Trust Fundfor Gaza and the
West Bank (TFGWG) was approved by the Board o f the World Bank on June, 6, 2005 for a
total amount o f US$ 20.0 million. The Trust Fund Grant Agreement was signed on July 10,
2005 and was declared effective on July 25, 2005. It was expected to close on January 31,
2009 but the closing date was extended to January 31, 2010. Moreover, the project has
received an additional financing (AF1) in the amount o f US$ 5.0 million, approved by the
Board o f the World Bank on April, 22, 2008. The Trust Fund Grant Agreement for the AF1
was signed on June 30, 2008 and was declared effective on September 25, 2008. The closing
date is January 31, 2010.
Project Development Objectives
The GEWP's development objectives are to: (ij improve the efficiency, management;
operation and delivery o f water and wastewater services in Gaza; (ii)build capacity o f the
Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU); and (iii)strengthen the regulatory and
institutional capacity o f the Palestinian Water Authority (PWAj. The project consists o f
three components: (a) Performance-based Management Contract; (b) Capital and Operating
Investments and (c) Institutional Reform and Capacity Building. The objectives have not
changed since the declaration o f effectiveness.
Current Project Status and monitoring
As o f March 2009, about US$19.6 million o f the US$25.0 million grants (US$20 million +
US$5.0 million AF1j has been disbursed. This is a very good disbursement rate given the
continuous restrictions on material entry into Gaza. The entire population of Gaza (1.5
million) continues to receive an adequate level o f water and sanitation services. This has
been achieved through the drilling and rehabilitation o f more than 40% o f the water wells,
ensuring 100% o f drinking water disinfection, continuous maintenance and repair of all
electromechanical equipment, replacing o f old service connections, replacement and
calibration o f water meters, rehabilitation and maintenance o f the sewage treatment systems
and facilities, the implementation o f the Emergency Operation Plan to properly manage the
risks from possible flooding o f the community nearby Beit Lahia wastewater treatment plant,
the establishment and equipment o f the C M W U regional offices, development o f the utility
billing and financial management systems and building the capacity o f PWA as the sector
regulator. Inaddition, the project is assisting incapacity building o fthe CMWU.
Although, the latest escalation o f the conflict in Gaza has delayed the growth o f the C M W U
into a fully autonomous entity, the C M W U has become a credible utility and managed to
attract resources o f other donors in the water sector. As parallel financing to the Bank's
project, C M W U has received and implemented around US$60 million o f donors' resources
over the last three years. The project's implementation progress and development objective
rating over the past twelve months has been moderately satisfactory. All safeguards and
legal covenants were met satisfactorily.
The Bank has recently (March 2008) agreed to a reallocation o f funds to enable the project to
prioritize urgent emergency needs following the recent escalation o f conflict in Gaza. The
existing Grant Agreement has been amended accordingly

PA'S REQUESTFORADDITIONAL FINANCING AND PROPOSEDUSEOFFUNDS
                                               (m)
The PA has requested an additional US$3.0 million from the TFGWB to help finance the
repair and rehabilitation of the damaged water works and equipment as a result o f the latest
escalation o f the conflict in Gaza (December 27, 2008 - January 21, 2009). The estimated
damage to the water sector in Gaza i s around US$6.0 million. The CMWU has managed to
fund the immediate repairs from the donor community. The remaining deficit o f US$3.0
million i s expected to be financed under this proposed second additional financing (AF2) to
this project as follows:

Table 1: Damage repair to be included in the AF2




The proposed AF2 will be utilized under component b: Capital and Operating Investments,
which comprises the rehabilitation, operation and maintenance o f the water and wastewater
infrastructure in Gaza through carrying out o f works, purchase o f materials, supplies and
construction equipment, and provision o f consultants' services.          The cost breakdown
according to the areas o f Gaza i s as follows:

PROPOSED CHANGES FOR THE AF
The project design, project objective and scope o f the original project will not change. The
AF2 i s intendedto helpthe PA to repair the damages (to equipment and works) caused by the
recent escalation o f conflict in Gaza.       Hence, the GEWP's implementation, financial
management, disbursement and procurement arrangements will stay the same (except for
changes noted below).     The AF2-specific procurement plan will be updated accordingly. It
is also suggested that the closing date be extended through December 31, 2010. In light o f
the tight closure imposed on Gaza there will be a need to extend the closing date o f the AF1
to December 31, 2010 too. The task team has agreed that there will be no needto update the
existing project implementation plan.
The project i s developed under OPBP 8.0 and no "formal" reappraisal was deemed
necessary. However, since the end o f the Gaza conflict in January 2009, the project team has
carried out an intensive supervision o f the original project as well as an "informal appraisal.
SAFEGUARDS
The safeguards and environmental aspects of the project remain the same. All project sites
have been investigated by the safeguards team and there are no project proposals,
implementation o f which would require land acquisition or result in involuntary resettlement.
No known archaeological or historical sites would be affected by rehabilitation sub-projects,
nor does the operating investment component o f the project raise any international water
issues. Accordingly, and as the activities are a continuation to those initiated under the
original project and no new project sites are envisaged, the Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) and Environmental Mitigation and Management Plan (EMP) which were
completed in March 2001 as part o f the Project preparation and revised in June 2008 are still
valid. Both the EIA and EMP are available on file within the World Bank's Infoshop. Since
the safeguards team has confirmed that the proposed changes do not affect any safeguards
issues, there is no need to update the ISDS.
PROCUREMENT       ARRANGEMENTS
Procurement under this AF2 will be carried out in accordance with the 'Guidelines On
Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits and Grants' known as the '2006 Anti-Corruption Guidelines', and the
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004, revised in
October 2006; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers" dated May 2004, revised in October 2006, and the accompanying standard
biddingdocuments.
The thresholds for procurement methods and Bank's prior review are detailed in the AF2-
specific procurement plan attached to this project paper, Attachment 1
FINANCIALMANAGEMENT          ANDDISBURSEMENT       ARRANGEMENTS:
Financial Management. The project objectives o f the proposed additional financing will
remain the same as in the original project. The proposed activities will fall under the
categories o f the ongoing project, and will be implemented by same P M U at the CMWU.
The Financial Management arrangements for the proposed additional financing will build up
on the already existing financial management system o f the ongoing project. Same financial
management arrangements (including flow o f funds) will be applicable to the proposed




                                                55

additional financing, and will be implemented according to the existing Financial Manual o f
Procedures and the respective Grant Agreement.
Current FM Risk Rating of the Project. The overall financial management risk o f the
ongoing project is considered Substantial due the project structure (being implemented in
Gaza), limited access o f Bank fiduciary staff to Gaza and limited scope supervision from
Bank staff. Mitigating measures have been introduced, which include semi annual transaction
reviews to be conducted by external consultant, and introducing enhanced internal control
measures. FMrisk after mitigatingmeasures i s expected to be Moderate.
Current FM Performance of the Project. The P M U at the Gaza C M W U has in place
adequate computerized FM system (AI-Aseel). The existing P M U management and staff
have the required qualifications and experience to satisfy the Bank's fiduciary requirements.
Quarterly FMRs were received on time and considered satisfactory to the Bank. Annual
audit reports were received on time with unqualified audit opinion from a qualified auditor.
Management letter submitted with the 2007 audited financial statements o f the project
identified certain internal control weaknesses, examples are absence o f Internal Audit
Function. Based on the review of the 2007 Audit Report, the Bank raised comments and
recommended amendment to the Annual Audit Report o f 2007 and requested the auditor to
submit a revised audit report, which were received and considered satisfactory by the Bank.
Internal audit function should be activated and be functional through hiring o f an Internal
Auditor for the CMWU.
Disbursement Plan. An updated disbursement plan should be prepared by the CMWU /
P M U to reflect the amounts o f additional financing and the detailed activities that will be
financed under the proposed additional financing. The amended disbursement plan has been
received by the Bank.
DisbursementArrangements. The same Designated Account for the existingfinancing from
World Bank will be used for the additional financing. Separate records will be set up in the
accounting system showing separately disbursed amounts related to each additional
financing.   Same disbursement arrangements will be used for the proposed additional
financings; will use traditional disbursement methods including the use o f Special Account,
Statement o f Expenditures (SOE), full documentation, and direct payments. Based on the
disbursement needs o f the project, the ceiling o f the Designated Account will need to be
increased to reflect the additional financing, which will be agreed on before negotiations.
Interim Financial Reports (IFRs): The current reporting arrangements are satisfactory and
will be extended to the additional financing. Hence, IFRs o f the AF will be part of the
existing project IFRs, with separate reporting related to existing as well as the proposed
additional financing. IFRswill be prepared and submittedto the Bank on a quarterly basis by
no later than 45 days after the end o f the previous quarter.
Audit Arrangements: Audit Arrangements: As is the case for the ongoing project, the
additional financing will be subject to an annual independent external audit. With the
additional financing, the current project audit arrangements will be extended to the additional
financing to cover all funding under the project. The Project's financial statements (including
the AF2) will be audited annually by an independent external auditor acceptable to the Bank,
in accordance with internationally accepted auditing standards and terms of reference cleared
by the Bank. Additional financing and original financing funded by the Bank to be reported
separately by the auditor. The audit report will be sent to the Bank no later than six months
following the closing o f the fiscal year.

Supervision: As is the case for the ongoing project, the financial supervision activities will
include inter-alia, SOEs review, review of quarterly Financial Reports, review of annual
audited financial statements and management letters as well as timely follow up on issues
raised by the auditor. In addition, Financial Management Consultant will carry out semi-
annual Statement of Expenditure (SOE) reviews to ensure that expenses reimbursed on the
basis of SOE transactionsare in compliancewith the Grant Agreement.

LEGAL   AGREEMENT-DIFFERENCESBETWEENORIGINAL PROJECTAND ADDITIONAL
FINANCING
A new trust fund grant agreement for the AF2 will be prepared. It will reflect the additional
amount of US$3 million. The closing date will be December 31, 2010 and the thresholdsfor
procurement methods and Bank's Prior Review and the procurement requirements for prior
contract review will be included in the AF- specific procurement plan. The date o f the
completionreportwill fit with the AF2 closingdate. The new StandardConditionsof July 1,
2008 will apply to the trust fund grant agreement, and the additional procedures for NCB in
the procurementsectionwill be updated. Inall other respects it is expected that the trust fund
grant agreement for the Additional Financing will be the same as the trust fund grant
agreement for the AF1 (other than updateddefinitions, as requiredby the changes described
above). The AF2-specific procurement plan will be approved by negotiations for the AF2.
The effectivenessconditionsinclude a new subsidiary agreement and legal opinion,


REVISED   PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND EXPECTEDOUTCOMES
The outcome indicators as revised under the first Additional Financing (AF1) remain the
same including provisions for adequate availability of water from existing wells, improving
distribution system efficiency, implementingequitable distribution plan, ensuring minimum
daily hours of water services and improving wastewater treatment efficiency, but will be
addedto underthe AF2 (as set out inAttachment 2).

                              PALESTINIANNGOI11PROJECT


PROJECT    HISTORY

1.   The Palestinian NGOIII was approved by the Bank Board on December, 19,2006 for a
total amount o f US$lO.O million and became effective on February 27, 2007. The current
closing date i s December 31, 2009. The project receives approximately Euro 6 million in
parallel financing from the AfD.

PROJECT    DEVELOPMENT     OBJECTIVES

2.   The main objective o f PNGOIII is to provide social services to those who are poor,
vulnerable or affected by the deteriorating socioeconomic conditions by establishing an
effective mechanism to improve the quality and sustainability o f NGO social service
delivery.
3.   PNGO I11consists o f three components:

     (i)     Grantsfor service delivery includes 4 different grant types to NGOs consisting o f
            the following (a) Empowerment Grants which are sub-grants supporting
            experienced NGOs in providing social services; (b) Mentoring Grants that fund
            mentoring partnerships that support social service delivery by small community
            based NGOs partnering with experienced NGOs; (c) Specialized Health Service
            grants which are sub-grants to specialized health service providers to respond to
            the current emergency; (d) pilot partnerships between NGOs and local
            governments through joint activities designed and implemented by municipalities
            and NGOs.
     (ii) NGO Sector Development             includes 3      activities: (a) preparation and
            implementation o f an NGO code o f conduct; (b) establishment o f a process o f
            NGO-sector coordination and informationexchange and; (c) policy and research.
     (iii) Institutional Development of        the NGO Development Center, including
            establishment of a resource mobilization and communications unit that will raise
            funds for grants to Palestinian NGOs to create a future mechanism to attract and
            channel resources to NGOs; establishment o f an outcome based monitoring and
            evaluation system; establishment o f the NDC; and supervision o f activities
            implemented under the project.

CURRENT PROJECT STATUSAND MONITORING

4.   As of March 2009, about US$ 5.8 million (60 percent) of the original grant has been
disbursed. About 97 % o f the grant amount has been committed. Six o f the 52 grants will be
completed by June 2009 (including 2 that are in Gaza) and the remainder by December 2009.
Delays in project implementation, especially in Gaza occurred due to the unavailability o f
materials and restrictions on obtaining international expertise. Following the closure o f some
NGOs by armed men in August 2008, includingten financed by the Bank project, the project
activities in Gaza were informally (and,temporarily) suspended until 4 conditions outlined by
the Bank were met:

                                              65

     (i)     N o closure o f additional Bank-financed NGOs in Gaza by Hamas or-others;

     (ii)    Continued commitment by the Palestinian authorities in the WB to limit risks to
             project activities and personnel financed by the Bank and other donors, in both
             the West Bank and Gaza

     (iii)   Submission o f appropriate documents confirming that all expenditures were for
             eligible expenses and

     (iv)    Stronger controls over NGOs inthe event o f a resumption o f full operations.
5.   All conditions were met. The Bank conducted a thorough review and audit of NGOs
that were closed to assess the risk that the armed men might have taken control over project
resources.    The Bank's review found that all expenses o f all NGOs were for eligible
expenditures. The armed men had confiscated assets o f one NGO, the Young Scientists
Club, worth about US$13,984 financed by the project. This amount was reimbursed to the
Bank on February 26, 2009, by the NGO Development Center, the implementing entity o f
PNGOIII. The Bank continues to closely supervise this project and finds project design to be
very sound.     Stricter financial management controls were introduced and the procedures
incorporated into a revised Operations Manual to mitigate against such risks in the future.
The Grant Implementation Agreements with the NGOs were also revised for ongoing
activities. The project's implementation progress and development objective ratings over the
past twelve months have been satisfactory.         All safeguards and legal covenants were met
satisfactorily.

PA'S REQUESTFORADDITIONAL FINANCING AND PROPOSEDUSEOFFUNDS
                                                 (AF)

6.   In its letter of March 30,2009, the PA has requested US$3 million from Bank budgetfor
assistance to the PNGO 111based on the Gaza Early Recovery and Reconstruction Plan, to
help the recovery efforts in Gaza. The AF would support existing Component 1 "Grants for
Social Delivery" given its ability to address the direct needs o f the population towards
recovery and Component 3, "Institutional Development o f the NGO Development Center."
The US$2.64 million will be allocated to 25 to 30 NGOs grant amounts ranging from
US$45,000 to US$250,000 and the remaining US$ 0.36 will be allocated towards existing
Component 3, for monitoring and evaluation, technical assistance to NGOs, supervision and
audits. The AF will focus on the first three types o f grants described above:
     (i) Empowerment grants              (US$1.39     million):  This window      will support
             approximately 11 NGOs, each working in a specific geographic area which
             collectively ensures wide coverage o f the Gaza Strip.            The activities are
             specifically designed to address the urgent needs o f the poorest segments o f the
             population and will include the following thematic areas: agricultural services,
             income generating activities for women, psychosocial support for children and
             vocational training for the deaf and visually impaired. These activities build upon
             initiatives beingimplemented under the ongoing program.

     (ii)    Mentoring grants (US$ 0.5): These support social service delivery by small
             community-based organizations partnering with experienced NGOs. The scale up
             will support educational services for marginalized children (including those with
             learning disabilities) in 6 different refugee camps. It will also work with youth in
             Gaza's southern governorates (Rafah, Khan Younis and AI Foukhra) all o f which
             witnessed the worst part of the recent escalation o f the conflict in Gaza. Two

                                                 66

             mentor NGOs will each work with 5 smaller NGOs, to improve the quality o f
             their service delivery through knowledge sharing and networking with
             professionalizedNGOs.

      (iii)  Grants to Specialized Health Service Providers (US$ 0.75): These will support
             NGO hospitals which provide specialized health care services currently
             unavailable in the public health care system.          Under PNGOIII three NGO
             hospitals were able to develop services thus far unavailable in Gaza, thereby
             improving health care quality and access in Gaza and limiting the need for
             referrals abroad. These activities will be scaled up.
7.    As this is an emergency response, the subproject proposal submission process will be
modified to ensure quick response while maintaining quality o f service delivery. These
modified procedures will be described in the revised Operations Manual by effectiveness.
NGOs who are currently receiving assistance under PNGOIII and providing the needed
services (as identified in the PA's Gaza Early Recovery and Reconstruction Plan) will be
invited to submit proposals for subprojects intended to either scale up existing interventions
or to introduce initiatives that respond to the current crisis. Three to five new NGOs may
also be invitedto submit proposals. The invitationwill be to prequalified NGOs on the basis
o f their proven track record in a specific area o f expertise critical to the early recovery effort
(psychosocial health, specialized health care, agricultural interventions etc).                This
modification in the proposal submission process is also based on the recommendations o f the
Bank's recent Midterm Review which pointed to unnecessarily lengthy application forms and
review processes. The proposal forms will be shortened and simplified to enable the NDC
team to conduct a rapid and yet efficient field appraisal. The criteria for appraisal would
include the relevance o f the proposed activities in the Gaza recovery (as described in the
GERRP), the NGO's track record, its implementation capacity, justification for the project,
realistic budget, etc. These modifications will be included inthe revised Operations Manual.

PROPOSEDCHANGES FORTHE AF

8.    The original project was designed as a demand driven intervention to respond to urgent
social service needs. Subprojects were identified and proposed by NGOs through a process
o f community consultation. The AF i s a simple scale up o f the most successful aspects o f the
Original project (the first three windows o f Component 1 and Component 3 for project
supervision, monitoring and evaluation and audit aspects) designed to ensure a direct and
rapid impact on Gaza's poorest and most vulnerable population. As verified and confirmed
by extensive supervision missions to Gaza, which served as the basis for the preparation o f
this AF, no major changes to the project's basic design is required.

SAFEGUARDS

9.    The extensive supervision missions of the project also included a review o f safeguards
aspects. Under the original project OP 4.01 (Environment Assessment) was triggered and
accordingly an Environmental Management Plan was prepared and disclosed under the
original project. A recent midterm review had also reviewed implementation o f the EMP and
found it to be satisfactory and it therefore remains valid. The supervision missions also
confirmed that the Bank's social safeguards policy (OP 4.12 on involuntary resettlement) will
not be triggered. Any investments that involve involuntary resettlement or the acquisition o f
land will be ineligible as described in the Operations Manual which places such interventions

                                                67

on a negative list. New building construction, implying the need for land acquisition, is also
ineligible for funding under PNGOIII. Any potentialworks under the project are mainly for
rehabilitation of damaged farmland and existing buildings. No constructionon "new land"
will be permittedunder the project.

FINANCIAL    MANAGEMENT

10. Activities proposedwill be under same categories as under the current project, and will
be implemented by the same entity, the NGO Development Center (NDC). The Financial
Management arrangements for the proposed additional financing will build on the already
existing financial management system (recently updated and modified) used for the
implementation of the current project. The same Financial Management arrangements
(including funds flow arrangements) will be applicable to the AF proposed, and will be
implemented according to the existing (revised) Financial Manual of Procedures and the
relevant Grant Agreement. Additional details on FinancialManagement and Disbursement
arrangements are includedinAttachment 1.
11. Current FM Risk Rating of the Project. The overall financial management risk o f the
ongoing project is considered Substantial due the project structure; providing support to
NGOs in both West Bank and Gaza through mainly grants. Mitigatingmeasures have been
introducedand in place, which include implementingadequate FM arrangements and control
procedures from NDC towards the implementing NGOs according to project FM and
operationmanual. FMrisk after mitigatingmeasures is expected to be Moderate.

PROCUREMENT      ARRANGEMENTS

12. Procurement under this AF will be carried out in accordance with the 'Guidelines on
Preventingand Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financedby IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits and Grants' known as the '2006 Anti-Corruption Guidelines', and the
"Guidelines:Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004, revised in
October 2006; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers" dated May 2004, revised in October 2006, and the accompanying standard
biddingdocuments.
13. The thresholds for procurement methods and Bank's Prior Review are detailed in the
updated and approved procurementplan annexed to the project paper in Attachment 2. The
revisedProjectProcurementManual should be approvedby effectiveness.

LEGAL    AGREEMENT- DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ORIGINAL PROJECT AND ADDITIONAL
FINANCING

14. A new trust fund grant agreement will be prepared for the AF. The project closingdate
will be September 30 2011. The procurement section will refer to the procurement and
consultant guidelines as revised in 2006. The new Standard Conditions of July 1, 2008 and
the Anti-Corruption guidelines will apply to the trust fund grant agreement. In all other
respects it is expected that the trust fund grant agreement for the AF will follow the original
project's trust fund grant agreement (except for updated definitions, as required by the
changes described above).
The effectiveness conditionswill include a new subsidiary agreement, project agreement
and the revision of the operations manual.

                                                                             Attachment 1



                FinancialManagementandDisbursementArrangements

Financial Management. Activities proposed will be under same categories as under the
current project, and will be implementedby the same entity, the NGO Development Center
(NDC). The FinancialManagement arrangements for the proposedadditionalfinancing will
build on the already existing financial management system (recently updated and modified)
used for the implementation of the current project. The same Financial Management
arrangements (includingfunds flow arrangements) will be applicableto the AF proposed, and
will be implementedaccording to the existing (revised) FinancialManual of Procedures and
the relevant Grant Agreement.

Current FM Performance of the Project. NDC has adequate FM arrangement with
acceptable computerized accounting system (Bisan) and an acceptable Financial Procedures
Manual. NDC FM staff are considered adequate and satisfactory. The quarterly IFRs were
submitted on time and are considered satisfactory to the Bank. The 2007 Annual Audit
reports for the on-goingproject were received after the due date. Based on the review o f the
2007 Audit Report, the Bank raised comments and recommended amendment to the Annual
Audit of 2007 and requestedthe auditorto submit a revisedaudit report, which were received
and considered satisfactory by the Bank.

NDC has selected a new external auditor, and audit process covering the year 2008 already
initiated. Annual audit report covering the year ending 2008 is expected to be received
before the due date June 30, 2009. Internal audit function should be activated and be
functional, either through increased internal audit review from the Welfare Association or
throughhiring o f an InternalAuditor for the NDC.

Disbursement Plan. An updated disbursement plan was prepared by the NDC to reflect the
amounts of additional financing and the detailed activities that will be financed under the
proposedadditionalfinancing. It is includedin this attachment.

DisbursementArrangements. The same Designated Account for the existing financing from
World Bank will be used for the AF. Separate records will be set up in the accounting
system showing separately disbursed amounts related to each AF. Same disbursement
arrangements will be used for the proposed additional financings; will use traditional
disbursement methods including the use o f Special Account, Statement of Expenditures
(SOE), full documentation, and direct payments. Based on the disbursement needs o f the
project and the quarterly disbursement plan submitted, the current DA ceiling are considered
sufficient to cover the short term cash needs under both the ongoing and the additional
financing o f the project. There is no need to increase the ceiling of the DA to reflect the
additionalfinancing; the DA ceilingwill remainthe same as inthe ongoingproject.

Interim Financial Reports (IFRs). The current reporting arrangements are satisfactory and
will be extended to the additional financing. Hence, IFRs for the AF will be part of the
existingproject IFRs, with separate reportingrelatedto existingas well as the AF. IFRswill
be prepared and submitted to the Bank on a quarterly basis by no later than 45 days after the
end ofthe previousquarter.

Audit Arrangements.As is the case for the ongoing project, the additional financing will be
subject to an annual independent external audit. With the additional financing, the current
audit arrangements will be extended to the additional financing to cover all funding under the
project. The NDC's financial statements (including the AF) will be audited annually by an
independent external auditor acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with internationally
accepted auditing standards and terms o f reference cleared by the Bank. AF and original
financing funded by the Bank to be reported separately by the auditor. The audit report will
be sent to the Bank no later than six (6) months following the closing o fthe fiscal year.

Supervision. As is the case for the ongoing project, financial supervision activities will
include inter-alia, review o f SOEs review, o f quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports
(FMRs), review of annual audited financial statements and management letters as well as
timely follow up on issues raised by the auditor. There will be two financial management
supervisions per year. Bank supervision missions will consist o f visits to N D C and a sample
o f eligible NGOs receiving grant funds. They will cover a review o f FM practices,
procurement methods, payment procedures and documentation to ensure consistent and
efficient application o f the financial management system.

PROJECT   HISTORY
1.   The Tertiary Education Project (US$16.5 million: US$10 million from the Trust Fund
for Gaza and the West Bank -TFGWB, and Euro 5.0 million from the European
Commission) was approved by the Bank Board on April 21, 2005.                 The Trust Fund
agreement was signed on May 16'h, 2005 and became effective June 15, 2005, and the project
was launched on June 25, 2005.           Over the past twelve months, the project has been
consistently rated satisfactory for both, implementation progress and achievement o f
development objectives. In fact, throughout its four years o f implementation this project has
been rated satisfactory and one o f its components - the QIF has been rated highly
satisfactory. The project is scheduled to close on December 31,2009.

OBJECTWES
2.   The project development objectives are to assist the PalestinianAuthority to: (i)improve
the policy-making environment for tertiary education management, governance and quality
assurance; (ii)increase the internal and external efficiency o f tertiary education institutions;
and (iii)create incentives and provide the basis for improvements in efficiency, quality and
relevance o f supply o f tertiary education.

3.   The Project consists of the following parts: (1) strengtheningthe policy making role of
the Ministry o f Education and Higher Education, the Higher Education Council (HEC) and
the Accreditation and Quality Assurance Commission (AQAC); (2) capacity building
program to increase internal and external efficiency o f tertiary education institutions; and (3)
support to quality improvement o f the beneficiaries.

CURRENTSTATUS
4.   From the first supervision mission held six months after the project was launched,
excellent progress has been observed in particular on the management o f component 3, the
Quality Improvement Fund (QIF) aimed to provide support to improve the quality o f
Palestinian Tertiary Education Institutions and programs so they are: (i)relevant to the job
market and economic development o f WB&G; (ii)made competitive with international
standards; and (iii)capable o f developing income-generating programs.

5.   The project has already met its key development indicators. On the new entrants into
priority areas defined by relevance to the labor market, the 40% target has already been met.
To balance the enrollment in technical colleges, the target o f 27% o f new entrants into
tertiary education to Technical and Community Colleges was reached for the 2005-2006
period, and it reached 29% for the 2007-2008 period.

6.   Other performance indicators called for 50% o f universities and 30% o f colleges
completing the institutional self assessmentprocess and initiated strategic plans by the end o f
the project and 70% o f universities and 30% of colleges have received QIF Grants. To date
these goals have been doubled, with 90% o f Universities and 50% o f Community and
Technical Colleges having successfully received and implemented QIF grants, and 90% o f all
TEIs, with Institutional SelfAssessments and Strategic Plans under preparation.


                                               79

7.   It is important to note that not only the quantitative targets have been doubled, the
quality o f the projects, and the sound implementation o f the grants are having an important
positive impact on the institutions, and on the Higher Education System as a whole. The total
disbursements reached US$S.O million as o f March 15,2009.

8.   The use o f the competitive mechanism to allocate funds has proven to be very
successful. The process o f preparing project proposals has resulted in capacity building in
project preparation, and for several institutions, this capacity has resulted in generating
additional revenues. In addition, grant implementation has been an important vehicle for
capacity building in project management, procurement and financial management and
reporting for the Universities and Colleges. MOEHE has been able to manage QIF program
with transparency and professionalism.

PA'S REQUESTFORADDITIONAL FINANCING AND PROPOSEDUSEOFFUNDS
                                               (AF)
9.   The recent conflict in Gaza took a toll on the Islamic University and the Community
College o f Applied Science and Technology, and most o f their facilities (including laboratory
and IT equipment procured under Bank's project) were destroyed. In addition, throughout
project implementation there has been overwhelming demand for funding from Palestinian
Universities and Colleges. The number o f proposals submitted in each cycle, has always
exceeded the financing resources available under QIF. The first two cycles submitted more
than 40 proposals each, and only 7 and 9 were approved respectively. The IT and third
cycles each submitted 30 proposals, and only 14 and 9 were approved respectively. All the
funds from QIF have been committed, and the QIF Board has not been able to meet all the
demands from institutions. In addition, there are critical needs to improve and upgrade
Teacher Education Programs, and both MOEHEand the QIF Board have set this as a priority
for fbture support to be providedby QIF.

10. Based on the successful implementation o f this project, and the overwhelming demand
from institutions for funding, the critical needs o f Teacher Education Programs, and the
destruction o f some-Gaza Tertiary Education Institutions, the PA has requested an additional
$US 5 million. These funds will be used to finance components 1 and 3 of the original
project.

PROPOSED CHANGES FOR THE AF
11. The recent conflict in Gaza took a toll on the Universities and Colleges, severely
damaging their infrastructure including some o f the laboratories and facilities that had
received funding through QIF. In addition the school system i s facing critical challenges as in
the past three years, learning outcomes have been decreasing steadily. The effects of the
conflict are having a negative impact on teachers and students. Teacher education programs
in Palestine do not equip student teachers with the pedagogical skills and teaching
competencies which are needed to implement a curriculum which i s said to promote critical
thinking, higher-order thinking skills and the like. Teacher educators themselves are not
prime examples o f active teaching and do not model intheir classes those pedagogical skills.
The additional funding will have as a priority to support the teacher education programs
offered by Universities and Colleges in both the West Bank and in Gaza.
12. The AF will finance existing components 1 and 3. Component 1. Strengtheningthe
policy making role of MOEHE,HEC and AQAC. The objective of this component is to
strengthen the capacity o f MOEHE and related policy making bodies, to formulate, plan and

                                               80

monitor the education policy framework. The additional funds (US$0.6 million) will be
allocated to the management o f the QIF, and the implementation o f the financial management
system o f MOEHE.
 13. Component 3:       Support to Quality Improvement o f Tertiary Education Institutions
(beneficiaries). The main objective of the Quality Improvement Fund (QIF) is to provide
support to improve the quality o f PalestinianTEIs and programs so they are (i)relevant to the
job market and economic development o f WB&G; (ii)made competitive with international
standards; and (iii)capable o f developing income-generating programs.         The additional
funding (US$4.2 million) to improve the quality and relevance of the teacher education
programs by higher education institutions at all levels from pre-school to secondary schools.
The type of investment supported through this sub-component include: (i)funds to finance
innovative programs through QIF, including pedagogical capacity building program for
teacher educators; (ii)management o f the fund; (iii)international and local technical
assistance and related consulting services for capacity building o f higher education
institutions and for program evaluation; (iv) dissemination o f best practices and twining
arrangements for capacity building; (v) program dissemination and informationcampaign.
 14. The task team has concluded that the project implementationplan will not need to
be updated for the AF, The project outcome indicators will be expanded in order to capture
the changes described above. These changes are described inAttachment 1.

SAFEGUARDS

 15. This project was classified as Environment Category C, and no Safeguards were
triggered at appraisal. A social assessment concluded that there is a positive correlation
between income and access to higher education. To mitigate the social risks MOEHE took a
series o f measures o f which the most important one has been to activate and expand loan and
assistance programs for students.         This program has operated throughout project
implementation, albeit with low recovery on loans. To mitigate the financial sustainability o f
the Student Loan Fund, the Bank has provided Technical Assistance to MOEHE to improve
the management o f the student aid program, and build their capacity to eventually manage a
sustainable Student Loan Program. In addition IFC is funding a Loan facility operated
through a commercial bank.

The activities proposed to be financed through the additional resources do not trigger any
safeguard issues.

FINANCIAL    MANAGEMENT

 16. The project objectives o f the proposed additional financing will remain the same as in
the original financing for this project. Activities proposed will be under same categories o f
current project, and will be implemented by same PIU at the Ministry o f Education (MOE).
The Financial Management arrangements for the proposed additional financing will build up
on the already existing financial management system at the current project. Same Financial
Management arrangements (including funds flow arrangements) will be applicable to the
additional financing proposed, and will be implemented according to the existing Financial
Manual o f Procedures and the respective Grant Agreement. Additional details on Financial
Management and Disbursement arrangements are included in Attachment 3.



                                              81

17. Current FM Risk Rating of the Project. The overall financial management risk of the
ongoing project i s considered Substantial due the project structure; providing support to
Educational Institutions in both West Bank and Gaza through mainly grants. Mitigating
measures have been introduced and in place, which include implementing adequate FM
arrangements and control procedures from MOEHE PIU towards the implementing
Educational Institutions according to project operation manual. FM risk after mitigating
measures i s expected to be Moderate.




                                           82

PROCUREMENTARRANGEMENTS

18. Procurementunder this AF will be carried out in accordance with the 'Guidelines On
Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits and Grants' known as the '2006 Anti-Corruption Guidelines', and the
"Guidelines: Procurementunder IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004, revised in
October 2006; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers" dated May 2004, revised in October 2006, and the accompanying standard
biddingdocuments.

19. The revisedthresholdsfor procurementmethods and Banks Prior Review are detailed in
the procurement plan in the attachment 2. The procurement plan and revised QIF manual
have beenrevisedduringthe March2009 mission,and the final version is attached.

20. The project is developed under OP/BP 8.0 and no ''formal'' reappraisal was deemed
necessary. However, since the end of the Gaza conflict in January 2009, the project team has
carried out an intensivesupervisionof the originalproject as well as an "informal appraisal."

PROPOSEDAMENDMENTS        TO THE LEGAL     AGREEMENT- DIFFERENCESBETWEENORIGINAL
PROJECTAND ADDITIONALFINANCING

21. A newtrust fund grant agreement will be prepared for the AF. Itwill have a closingdate
of December 31, 2012 and reflect the additional amount. One of the implementation
covenants will be modified to reflect that QIF will be supervisedby the Director of QIF and
the Assistant Deputy for Higher Education-Chairof the Project Technical Committee, rather
than the Director of AQAC. The new Standard Conditions of July 1, 2008 will apply to the
trust fund grant agreement and the format ofthe agreement will follow the current format for
grant agreements. The thresholds for procurementmethods and Bank's Prior Review will be
includedin the AF- specific procurementplan, and the additional proceduresfor NCB inthe
procurement section will be updated. In all other respects it is expected that the trust fund
grant agreement for the Additional Financing will follow the original project's trust fund
grant agreement (exceptfor updateddefinitions, as requiredby the changes describedabove).

                FinancialManagementandDisbursementArrangements

Financial Management. The project objectives o f the proposed additional financing will
remain the same as in the original financing for these projects. Activities proposed will be
under same categories of current projects, and will be implemented by same PIU at the
Ministry o f Education (MOE). The Financial Management arrangements for the proposed
additional financing will build up on the already existing financial management system at the
current project.     Same Financial Management arrangements (including funds flow
arrangements) will be applicable to the additional financing proposed, and will be
implemented according to the existing Financial Manual o f Procedures and the respective
Grant Agreement.
Current FMPerformance of the Project is assessed to be satisfactory. Project had adequate
FM arrangements, computerized accounting system is in place (Bisan), supported with
acceptable Financial Manual o f Procedures. FM staff i s adequate to the project FM needs,
and has the sufficient experience. Annual Audits and Quarterly FMRs were received on time
and considered satisfactory to the Bank. Auditor expressed an unqualified opinion on the
Audit Report of 2007, and auditor also issued a management letter with no major weaknesses
inthe internal control system. Internal and External Audit arrangements are inplace.
Disbursement Plan. An updated disbursement plan was prepared by the MOE / PIU to
reflect the amounts o f additional financing and the detailed activities that will be financed
under the proposed additional financing. The amended disbursementplan has been revised
duringthe March 2009 mission.
DisbursementArrangements. The same DesignatedAccount (DA) for the existing financing
from World Bank will be used for the additional financing. Separate records will be set up in
the accounting system showing separately disbursed amounts related to each additional
financing.   Same disbursement arrangements will be used for the proposed additional
financings; will use traditional disbursement methods including the use o f Special Account,
Statement o f Expenditures (SOE), full documentation, and direct payments. Based on the
disbursement needs o f the project and the quarterly disbursementplan submitted, the current
DA ceiling are considered sufficient to cover the short term cash needs under both the
ongoing and the additional financing o f the project. There i s no needto increase the ceiling o f
the DA to reflect the additional financing; the DA ceiling will remain the same as in the
ongoing project.
Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) The current reporting arrangements are satisfactory and
will be extendedto the additional financing. Hence, IFRs for the additional financing will be
part o f the existing project IFRs, with separate reporting related to existing as well as the
additional financing. IFRswill be prepared and submittedto the Bank on a quarterly basis by
no later than 45 days after the end o f the previous quarter.
Audit Arrangements: As is the case for the ongoing project, the additional financing will be
subject to an annual independent external audit. With the additional financing, the current
project audit arrangements will be extended to the additional financing to cover all funding
under the project. The Project's financial statements (including the additional financing) will
be audited annually by an independent external auditor acceptable to the Bank, in accordance
with internationally accepted auditing standards and terms of reference cleared by the Bank.
Additional financing and original financing funded by the Bank to be reported separately by

the auditor. The audit report will be sent to the Bank no later than six months following the
closing o f the fiscal year.
Supervision: As is the case for the ongoing project, the financial supervision activities will
include inter-alia, SOEs review, review o f quarterly Financial Reports, review o f annual
audited financial statements and management letters as well as timely follow up on issues
raised by the auditor. The project will be supervised at least quarterly. FM supervision
mission reports will be made available by project team leader to other stakeholders.
