                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In addition to achieving the main objectives, by introducing a competitive allocation process among Tertiary Education Institutions (TEIs) the proposed and implemented QIF grants
                         were highly relevant to the local market needs. Overall, the QIF has supported the establishment of 24 important partnerships among TEIs and the public and private sector which
                         until that point had not existed. The QIF has also been characterized by wide participation of TEIs with 100% of universities and 50% of colleges in WBG implementing QIF grants.
                         The QIF's achievements and impact on the tertiary education sector has shown for the first time the utility of a QIF as a financing instrument for undertaking reforms within the
                         education sector. While the high level of participation, innovation of QIF projects and achievement of project objectives are clear indicators of the commitment of the Palestinian
                         Authority (PA) and other stakeholders to improve the tertiary education system ­ essential in ensuring that the West Bank and Gaza has a highly skilled workforce.

                         These diverse and innovative QIF projects have increased the relevance of TEI programs and training to labor market realities, supported TEIs in remaining competitive and have
                         strengthened their capacity to develop income-generating activities. The QIF has been so successful that an additional financing (AF) grant (TF094590) in the amount of US$5 million
                         was approved on May 28, 2009 to provide financing to the QIF and to support policy-making and management of MOEHE, HEC and AQAC. The AF will focus on teacher education
                         programs offered by TEIs. The AF Trust Fund Grant Agreement (TF094590) was signed on July 14, 2009 and became effective on July 17, 2009. The closing date of the AF is
                         December 31, 2012. The entire amount of about US$4.2 million allocated to the QIF AF component has been fully committed.
