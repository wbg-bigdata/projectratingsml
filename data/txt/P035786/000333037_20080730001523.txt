1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

The project context under the Country Assistance Strategy at the time of project
preparation was to (i) promote private sector activity; (ii) restructure the public sector;
(iii) ensure the social sustainability of the economic transition of Ukraine; and (iv) ensure
environmental sustainability. In May 1995 the Bank prepared a water and wastewater
sector study that proposed four components of strategy reform: (i) the transformation of
municipal Vodokanals into independent, corporatized utilities regulated by local
governments; (ii) the gradual improvement of the Vodokanals into financially self-
sufficient institutions through tariff reform and better revenue collection; (iii) the
adoption of viability-based investment policies by introducing least-cost strategies with
preference to plant and network rehabilitation, and to enhanced operating efficiencies;
and (iv) the enlistment of consumers as principal stake-holders in Vodokanal decision
making. Within this context a dual municipal water and wastewater project comprising
the cities of Lviv and Odessa was identified in 1995 and preparations began. Shifting
political administrations and the prospective borrowers' reluctance to accept the Bank's
project concept delayed appraisal by about five years. The project that was finally
appraised in 2001 comprised Lviv alone and had the primary development objective "to
improve accessibility and quality of water supply and wastewater services at an
affordable level in Lviv, and restore public confidence in the sector." In order to meet its
primary objective the project was designed to (i) improve the efficiency of Lviv
Vodokanal's (LVK) technical, commercial and financial operations through a
management and operations improvement advisory services contract; and (ii) enhance
LVK's financial capacity through reducing operating costs, better justified investment
selection, progressive full-cost recovery policies, and effective consumer-oriented
commercial practices.

1.1     Context at Appraisal

The project was first appraised in May 1997 in its original scope, i.e. encompassing both
Lviv and Odessa and with the prospective borrowers accepting (reluctantly) a twinning
agreement in the case of Odessa and (less reluctantly) a management contract with a
foreign utility operator in the case of Lviv. The latter management model could be
described as the World Bank's paradigm for water supply and sanitation projects at the
time. On this basis, a Negotiations Package was sent to the Government of Ukraine on
November 20, 1998 inviting for negotiations. The original project concept did not prevail
in the face of a lack of political support in Ukraine and because of the evolving
perception within the World Bank of the indispensability of having a foreign
management contractor. Following protracted internal clearance processes within
Ukraine the Government's Cabinet Committee for Economic Development reviewed the
project and in June 2000 confirmed the Government's readiness to support the Lviv part
of the project. On this basis the Bank updated its appraisal with particular emphasis on
meeting the Bank's requirements for safeguard and fiduciary policies. Similarly, the
earlier proposed management contract with a foreign utility operator was replaced by
advisory services from a foreign consultant. What remained was a simpler project to



                                                 1

rehabilitate deteriorated sections of the Lviv water supply and wastewater system. The
financial and operational improvements were left to the LVK to undertake, advised by
consultants.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
(as approved)

The primary PDO was to "To improve accessibility and quality of the water supply at an
affordable level in Lviv, and to restore public confidence in the sector." In order to reach
the PDO it was noted that it would be necessary for LVK (i) to improve the efficiency of
LVK's technical, commercial and financial operations through a management and
operations improvement advisory services contract, and (ii) enhance LVK's financial
capacity through reducing operating costs, better justified investment selection,
progressive full-cost-recovery policies, and effective consumer-oriented commercial
practices. The primary PDOs will be used for the assessment of the project outcome since
the secondary PDOs should be considered as the means to reach the primary PDOs.

1.3     Revised PDO Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

The original PDO and key indicators were not revised.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

The beneficiaries of the project are the entire population in Lviv, estimated at around
800,000. In addition, the project's wastewater investments were expected to improve the
water quality in the Bug River that is a tributary to the Baltic Sea.

1.5     Original Components

The project had six components as detailed below:

(1)     Water Supply-Initial Defined Investments, IDI (US$13.20 million of which the
Bank would finance US$9.50 million, 39% of total Bank-financed project cost)
comprising four sub-components:(i) rehabilitation of water pumping stations (US$1.65
million); (ii) establishment of pressure zones (US$7.45 million); (iii) replacement of
pipelines (US$ 3.45 million); and purchase of repair and construction equipment
(US$0.65 million). The Initial Defined Investments had been identified by LVK with the
assistance of international consultants and were supposed to be implemented within the
first two years of the project in order to reduce pumping costs and leakage.

(2)     Wastewater (US$11.10 million) for two sub-components: (i) rehabilitation of
wastewater pumps in a pumping station and in one wastewater treatment plant (US$2.80
million, of which the Bank was to finance US$2.30 million, or 10% of the Bank-financed
project cost); and (ii) rehabilitation of two wastewater treatment plants (US$ 8.30 million,
financed by a SIDA grant);




                                                 2

(3)    Operating Fund (OF, in an amount of US$10.60 million, of which the Bank was
to finance US$8.00 million, or 33% of the Bank-financed project cost) for two sub-
components: (i) additional upgrading and efficiency improvements of the LVK water
supply infrastructure (US$8.60 million); and (ii) other hardware and software
expenditures for improving LVK's performance (US$2.00 million). The use of the OF
was conditioned on the endorsement by the Management and Operations Improvement
Advisor (MOIA) who was employed by LVK as a condition of effectiveness of the Loan
Agreement;

(4)    Institutional strengthening (US$2.90 million) for two sub-components: (i)
management and advisory operations improvement advisory services (MOIA) of which
the costs during the first three years under the five-year contract were to be financed by
the Bank ­loan in an amount of US$2.60 million, or 11% of the Bank-financed project
cost); and (ii) incremental expenses for a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in an
amount of US$0.1 million);

(5)    Engineering and Construction Supervision Services (US$ 2.45 million, of which
the Bank was to finance US$1.35 million, or 6% of the Bank-financed project cost) for
three sub-components: (i) engineering services for design and procurement in relation to
the Operating Fund in an amount of US$ 0.85 million); (ii) construction supervision in an
amount of US$ 0.70 million in relation to the use of the IDI and OF; and (iii) engineering
and supervision services for the wastewater component investment (US$0.90 million).
The first two sub-components were to be financed mainly by the Bank loan while the
third sub-component was to be financed by the SIDA grant; and

(6)    Auditor's Fees (US$0.31 million) of which the Bank loan was originally to
finance US$ 0.26 million or 1% of the Bank-financed project cost. However, the Bank
agreed that the LVK could finance the auditor's fee from its internal resources.

1.6    Revised Components

There were no revisions to the components although actual costs turned out somewhat
different from the appraised amounts.

1.7    Other significant changes

LVK did not extend the contract of the MOIA advisor after reviewing its needs in mid-
2005. The prerogative of LVK to review its needs for external management consultants
and take subsequent action had been agreed with the World Bank during the loan
negotiations in April 2001. By the same token but related to the main civil works
contract LVK chose to terminate the main IDI contract with a foreign contractor in 2007
because of the contractor's poor performance in the installation of pipes. Instead LVK
then contracted directly with a local civil works contractor who concluded the works
efficiently. Both modifications were done with the Bank's full coordination and
agreement.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The project benefited from the understanding gained from a water supply and wastewater
study that was prepared by the Bank and that was issued as a Green Cover on May 24,
1995. The study recommended five elements of sector reform: (i) reconstitution of
Vodokanals as autonomous public utilities with a corporate status and with regulation
from local governments that had authority for setting tariffs; (ii) adoption of new tariff
policies that would pay for both operations and maintenance costs (OPEX) and
investment costs (CAPEX); (iii) introduction of least-cost investment selection that
would stress rehabilitation; (iv) adjustments to existing environmental policies to bring
effluent standards to affordable levels; and (v) promotion of the private sector operators.
The Lviv project was the first Bank operation in Ukraine in the water supply and
wastewater sector. As such the project aimed at pioneering a number of the concepts
advanced in the sector study, based on the belief that the local conditions were favorable
for their application. However, in actuality the instability brought on by changing local
and national politics limited reform. Thus, (i) instead of an autonomous LVK the control
remained firmly with the Lviv City government that approved the tariff which made the
LVK an adjunct and extension of the prevailing local administration; (ii) new tariff
policies were not introduced; (iii) the least-cost investment solution was indeed selected
since the project was entirely about rehabilitation of the existing water and wastewater
system; (iv) the adjustment of the environmental effluent standards was not suitable to be
discussed, let alone achieved, through one isolated municipal project; and (v) instead of a
private management operator that was suggested by the Bank as a condition of
effectiveness for the originally appraised project (in the PAD dated November 20, 1998)
it was limited to the hiring of a Management Operations Improvement Adviser (MOIA)
and the technical supervision which was provided by an engineering consulting firm.
The reduced scope and willingness for reform might be inevitable given that the Bank
was driven by a quest for the theoretically optimal technical, economic, financial, and
institutional arrangements whereas the local government was simply intent of improving
the quality of water supply and wastewater services. Deeper reforms in all these areas
would undoubtedly been facilitated by political stability and economic stability but
neither existed at the time of the far-reaching transformation of the Ukrainian state. It
might simply have been unrealistic on the Bank's part to expect reforms to be achievable
in the scope of one single operation.

2.2     Implementation

The project was slow in starting up implementation. The project was approved by the
Bank Board of Executive Directors on June 5, 2001 but the loan was not signed until
August 27, 2002 and did not become effective until February 24, 2003. The inordinate
delays were caused by the uncertainty and indecision resulting from a change in the
central government in the same month that the project was approved and by the change in
local government following local elections in March 2002. Disbursements reflected the
uncertainty and the supervision ratings for implementation progress zigzagged from
satisfactory to unsatisfactory and back again. Nevertheless, once the project had been


                                                4

made effective there was never any real issue whether it was going to be completed. The
project concept was sufficiently robust since it was based on common-sense
rehabilitation. In essence, the Bank-financed project cost comprised 90% rehabilitation,
divided by the Initial Defined Investments (IDI) and the Operating Fund (OF). The
distinction between the two categories would appear to be a remnant from the original
idea of employing a Management Operator who would select and implement the OF
investments. This distinction became irrelevant since no Management Operator was
employed and since it was agreed not to extend the MOIA contract after about three years
of duration. However, the Project Agreement reflects the original concept since Schedule
2 stipulates that the Additional Investments financed by the Operating Fund must have
the joint approval by the LVK and the MOIA. In practice, this intent was never put into
effect. The Mid-Term Review took place in January 2005 and was limited to report on a
steadily improving implementation progress. The MTR agreed to a reduction by 80% in
the OF allocation since the city of Lviv had financed many of the OF items (such as
block water meters and pipe) directly from its city budget. A main contractor's
performance, which was in charge of the large Initial Defined Investments, was
significantly deteriorated in 2006 when the installation of pipe had started. Subsequently,
the main contractor's contract was terminated in early 2007 and LVK instead contracted
directly with a local contractor who satisfactorily completed the pending works by
November 2007. This local contractor was the original subcontractor of the main
contractor when the bid was proposed. In view of the short remaining period before the
loan closing, the Bank agreed the LVK to procure the local subcontract through the direct
contracting on an exceptional basis, which allowed the LVK to start the installation of
pipes from April 2007 when the construction period had started. Prior to that the Bank
had extended the closing date of the project by one year from December 31, 2006 to
December 31, 2007, acceding to a request from the Government. The extension took
note of the fact that implementation and disbursements lagged original projections in the
PAD by about two years because of the late signature and effectiveness. The effective
period of implementation was four and half years, or about the same as the original
forecast.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The monitoring and evaluation arrangements were contained in Supplemental Letter No.
1 to the Project Agreement. Each Bank supervision mission tracked progress towards the
performance indicators and, based on trends as compared to target compliance, requested
corrective action from the Lviv Vodokanal and the Lviv City Government. A total of 8
performance indicators were selected to track progress towards meeting the Project
objective of "improving the operation and management of the water supply and
wastewater systems in the city of Lviv." (Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement). The
evolution of the performance indicators was analyzed in connection with the evaluation
of the Project outcome. The year 2000 baseline values were provided for only 3 out of 8
performance indicators, attesting to the uncertain quality of operating data. The
performance indicators were well utilized by each successive Bank supervision mission.




                                              5

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project considered the safeguards compliance well. The environmental assessment
(OP 4.01) applied although the project comprised only rehabilitation. Nevertheless, an
Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Management Plan were prepared
and a public hearing and consultation process were successfully conducted in November
2000. A Rapid Social Assessment (RSA) was carried out in September 2000 and
confirmed the major findings of a Beneficiary Assessment that had been carried out in
1996 as part of the project's feasibility analysis. The RSA reported that only 15% of
Lviv's inhabitants had a 24-hour supply and that 63% of the Lviv households had a
scheduled (and unpredictable) supply of 6 hours or less. Operational Policy 7.50 applied
since the project is located on an international waterway. However, the project's
rehabilitation of assets, and in particular of the wastewater treatment plants, meant that it
would improve upon rather than worsen the downstream impact on the riparian states.
The fact that SIDA financed the major rehabilitation of the WWTP is proof of the
project's beneficial impact. The exception to the international notification requirements
of OP 7.50 was confirmed by the Bank's Legal Department. The audits for the years
2002-2005 were financed by LVK directly and were directly contracted with an auditing
firm acceptable to the Bank. In 2006 the Bank requested a change of auditing firm which
subsequent change required some additional time. Effective January 1, 2007 the Ukraine
Law of Public Procurement was changed and applied to the procurement of auditing
firms for LVK. After protracted public bidding procedures in accordance with the
Ukraine Law of Public Procurement (rather than a directly contracted firm as before) a
new auditing firm was contracted.          The time-consuming bidding and contracting
explained why the (unqualified) audit was submitted to the Bank with a delay. The Bank
procurement safeguards were complied with although the procurement proceeded slower
than originally planned, not atypical for a first borrower of Bank funds in the Ukraine
water supply and sanitation sector. The main difficulties were related to the contracting
and subsequent sub-standard performance by the main foreign civil works contractor, all
of which were implemented in close coordination with the World Bank. This contract
was finally rescinded and streamlined contracting with a Ukrainian civil works contractor
allowed works to be completed

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

No transition arrangements applied since the Lviv Vodokanal continued operating the
infrastructure that was rehabilitated under the project. The LVK was strengthened by the
measures in the Management & Operational Improvement Program that was identified by
the feasibility studies. Although the MOIA contract was not extended in mid-2005, many
of the recommendations were subsequently implemented by LVK itself. The change
reflected two circumstances: (i) LVK's disenchantment with a foreign and costly foreign
firm; and (ii) the internalization and greater ownership of LVK of the necessity of
upgrading its management. Such changes will arguably be more sustainable since they
are driven by LVK itself rather than by a foreign management firm and by the World
Bank.




                                                 6

Once project implementation had gained speed the Lviv City Council was prompted to
submit to the Ministry of Finance a request to increase the size of the Bank loan by an
amount of US$ 17.9 million under procedures of Additional Financing from the World
Bank. The Ministry of Finance in turn requested through a letter dated October 11, 2006
Additional Financing in the same amount and a commensurate extension of the Closing
Date. The Bank responded to this request for Additional Financing, conditioning any
further discussions on the results of next planned tariff increase. The tariff increase was
delayed and the issue of Additional Financing lapsed. Instead, the World Bank Group
offered through the International Finance Corporation a guarantee under its Sub-National
Development Program to the Municipal bond issuance.              However, the Lviv City
Government demonstrated that it would be cheaper financially to borrow from local
commercial banks rather than use the IFC guarantee. As a result, nothing came of either
the IFC Sub-National Development Program or the requested Additional Financing from
the World Bank.

The detailed design of sludge digester will be carried out by Swedish consulting firm
with a grant from Nutek (3 million SEK). Once the design is available, LVK will seek to
get the investment financing from donors.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project design was well aligned with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), both
the one valid at the time of project preparation and the latest one. The latest CAS (Report
# 26448) states that the quality (safety) and quantity (access/availability) of drinking
water, deterioration of municipal infrastructure and lack of sanitation facilities are
burning issues in many regions. Further, the most recent CAS states that the institutional
capacity to ensure proper integration of environmental infrastructure sustainability into
mainstream decision-making needs substantial strengthening. The Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) approved by the Board on December 6, 2007 states the importance of
reduced environmental and health risks and improved service delivery. These issues
were addressed by the project. In its original design it attempted to (i) bring in a private
management operator; (ii) restructure the public sector through converting the LVK into a
financially and institutionally autonomous corporatized utility; (iii) ensure the social
sustainability of transition through improving on the quality of essential services such as
water supply and wastewater; and (iv) ensure environmental sustainability through higher
efficiency of water supply provision and through the rehabilitation of wastewater
treatment plants that were not functioning satisfactorily. However, the local government's
reluctance to bring in a private operator and even its reluctance to continue with a foreign
management adviser; and the Lviv's City Council unwillingness to entertain any thought
of creating a financially and institutionally autonomous utility made the first two
objectives moot. In the event, the Lviv City Council preferred to slow LVK tariff
increases and instead finance directly investment expenditures that were parallel to the
Bank project. Similarly, the Lviv City Council agreed to pay for a substantial portion of
the debt service payments under the World Bank loan that started falling due from
October 15, 2006, i.e., before the closing date of the Loan.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives

According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) the primary PDO was to "To
improve accessibility and quality of the water supply at an affordable level in Lviv, and
to restore public confidence in the sector." The Project Loan Agreement states that the
objective of the Project "is to improve the operation and management of the water supply
and wastewater systems in the city of Lviv." The discrepancy between the two PDO
versions is considerable. It would be possible to meet the PDOs of the Loan Agreement
without meeting the PAD PDOs. For the sake of the ICR the PAD definition of the
objectives will be retained. The assessment of the project outcome will be based on the
evolution of the performance indicators during project implementation as shown below:

Development Objectives. Thus, of the DO -"To improve accessibility and quality of the

water supply at an affordable level in Lviv, and to restore public confidence in the
sector."- the project:

   · Did improve the accessibility and quality with only minor shortcomings since the
       shares of the population with a constancy of 24 hours and at least 10 hours,
       respectively rose from 15% to 39% and from at the most 37% to 91% (Baseline
       values from the Rapid Social Assessment in September 2000. The positive trend
       has continued after the loan closing date. LVK reported 42% of the city with 24-
       hour supply on February 29, 2008 and expects to meet the 50% target by the end
       of calendar 2008. This means that the original target is expected to be reached
       four and half years after effectiveness, in line with the original estimates of
       service improvement. The delayed effectiveness largely explains the delays in
       compliance with targets.
   · Did improve the affordability of service as evidenced by the collections ratio that
       rose to 94% (baseline not available).
   · Did improve the public's confidence in the sector as shown by the fact that the
       incoming calls to the LVK call center are predominantly inquiries and not
       complaints.

In addition, it is relevant to consider the efficacy of the project, i.e. to what degree the
planned physical investments did take place. This is detailed in Annex 2 and is
summarized below:

1.     Initial Defined Investments

   · 21.7 km of water supply pipelines were replaced versus the planned 20 km.
   · 9 pumping stations were rehabilitated versus the planned 10. However, the
       Yanivska pumping station is currently being rehabilitated with LVK's own fund.
   · About 90 valve nodes were installed.
   · 10 passenger and cargo vehicles; 15 tractor backhoes, 5 auto-cranes and 15 auto-
       trucks were purchased for emergency repairs and maintenance.

2.     Wastewater Investments

   · The pumping station at Wastewater Treatment Plant #2 was rehabilitated.
   · WWTP 1 and WWTP2 were rehabilitated including the aeration systems,
       clarifiers, and sludge disposal facilities as planned.

3.     Operating Fund

   · A study tour for LVK staff was organized.
   · A Management Information System (MIS) was purchased and commissioned;.
   · A SCADA Monitoring System was purchased and commissioned.
   · Special tools for cleanings of sewers were purchased.




                                                 9

4.      Institutional Strengthening

MOIA's services were contracted; and LVK followed its recommendations of:
installation of SCADA and MIS, the establishment of a call center that improved
relations with the LVK customers; the introduction of energy audits in order to identify
and respond to the highest priority needs for investment in higher energy efficiency, and
the creation and commissioning of a leak detection unit. Through these programs the
LVK began the transformation of its management from one where energy and water was
wasted with little concern of the financial sustainability into an autonomous water supply
and wastewater utility that incorporated higher standards of efficiency and service quality
that characterize West European utilities.

LVK financed the PIU expenses during project implementation. Significantly, the PIU
was never staffed by external consultants but exclusively by staff who were LVK career
employees. This circumstance made for a greater internalization and transfer of
knowledge within LVK and a higher likelihood of sustainable institutional improvements
once the project closed on December 31, 2007. In addition, the PIU Director position
was promoted to Deputy Director of LVK.

5.      Engineering and Construction Supervision Services

        Services were purchased and provided by two foreign companies.

6.      Auditor's Fees

        External auditing services were purchased throughout project implementation.

3.3     Efficiency

The PAD estimated the economic rate of return as 23%. The estimated rate of return
resulted from comparing the net incremental benefits of undertaking the project, i.e. the
difference between incremental revenues and expenses of the "with and without" project
scenarios. The PAD specified that the effect of tariff increases was eliminated from this
calculation. The ex post economic analysis should ideally replicate the calculation with
the actual values for incremental water consumed and incremental costs. However, such a
calculation is of little value as a point of comparison because of the following
considerations:

    · The PAD calculation was based on erroneous and misleading estimates of the
        level of water consumed. It estimated the level unaccounted-for-water at 42%, i.e.
        it assumed that consumption, as a proportion of production was 58%. However, a
        large share of households lacked individual meters before the project. In the
        absence of actual metering data LVK prior to the project's large-scale installation
        of water meters estimated the consumption of unmetered households as the




                                                10

        government consumption norm of 6.7 m3 per person and month (equivalent to
        230 lcd).
    · As the result of the project LVK now has actual metering data for about 46% of
        all households as compared to 19% prior to the project. The actual metering
        readings now show that the population is actually consuming only at about 6.7 m3
        per household and month, or equivalent to 2.2 m3 per person and month, or one
        third of the norm.
    · As a result an increasing share of households metered now produces dropping
        estimates of the real consumption level in Lviv. The water balances in the years
        1999 and 2006 can be summarized thus:


                   Category                        Situation in the       Situation in the
                                                      year 1999               year 2006
Water production in million m3                   121.0                  99.4
Water consumption metered and billed in           10.0                  23.3
million m3
Water consumption non-metered but billed          67.1                  24.5
in million m3
Total water consumption, metered and              77.1                  47.8
estimated in million m3
Revenue water (Billed/produced)                  64%                    48%

In conclusion, estimating the rate of return on the basis of incremental water consumption
(without allowing for tariff increases justified by better quality of service) would yield a
negative rate of return in the case of Lviv, contrary to all evidence of improved service
accessibility and quality. It is therefore not worth replicating the calculation contained in
the PAD since it was based on flawed estimates of the actual consumption levels.

A partial, more firmly based calculation of the efficiency of investment is available for
the energy cost savings from the pump rehabilitation of nine pumping stations. This
calculation is shown in Annex 3 and demonstrates a rate of return of 26% and a pay back
period of 3.4 years. This rate-of-return can be compared to a similar one in the PAD that
estimates the return on the rehabilitation of the pumping stations at 34%.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The outcome rating combines the individual ratings for relevance, efficacy in meeting the
PDOs, and the efficiency. The ICR rates the Overall Project Outcome as satisfactory.
Project relevance is judged high because it responded to priorities, both of the CAS valid
at the time of appraisal and the most recent one, where the serious deterioration of public
services and the need to create institutional capacity were singled out. Project efficacy is
similarly rated satisfactory because the project in substance has met all relevant targets,
albeit with a delay explained by the delayed effectiveness and startup of the project
investments. Finally, project efficiency is judged satisfactory as evidenced by the robust




                                                 11

rates-of-return for such investments (higher energy efficiency) that are comparable to the
estimates at the time of project appraisal.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

None

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

LVK has been strengthened as an institution by the project's institutional component.
However, the strengthening is hardly the direct result of the Management and Operations
Improvement Advisory Services that were not extended after about three years. The
MOIA adviser only produced the recommendations in paper which LVK considered that
they knew them already. It is doubtful whether such foreign technical assistance was
effective in the short term, particularly considering its cost. In the particular case of the
Lviv project the MOIA was paid in a strengthening currency (the British pound) and the
level of consultant remuneration seems to have bred a level of resentment because of the
very high differences in remuneration between the LVK staff and the foreign consultants.
LVK has effectively carried out the significant MOIA's general recommendations by
itself, notably the design and implementation of a Management Information System and a
Supervision Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) through which real-time
data on the operating processes are produced and used to optimize operating efficiency
and quality. In addition, the LVK established a modern customer call center, which
improved its ability to respond in real time to complaints and inquiries from its customers.
LVK also introduced the practice of modern energy audits in order to identify and
subsequently respond to the highest priorities of energy saving investments. Finally,
LVK created and made operational a leak detection unit in order to pinpoint the location
and size of leaks and then correct for them. Such activities are known to represent the
most efficient use of investment to save not only water but also energy since the Lviv
water supply system depends on pumped water from wells that are located as far as 110
km away.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The steadily dropping consumption levels reveal the impact that can be expected from
individual metering of households. On balance the evolution must be assessed as positive
since it has made possible a reduction in production by about 20% while increasing the
constancy (and therefore convenience) of supply.

The reconstruction of pumping stations made it possible to decrease electricity
consumption by about 20 million kWh hours per year as compared to 2004, and made
possible a simultaneous rise of payment collection during current year and allowed a
settlement of overdue accounts with OJSC "Lvivoblenergo." This proved a positive
contribution to the problem of overdue interagency arrears in Ukraine.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not Applicable

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The risk to the development outcome is rated as Moderate. The risk assessment is
predicated on the following partial risk assessments:

   · The technical risks are low since there is no innovative and untested technology.
       Rehabilitation of equipment is simply the transfer of technology and equipment
       that has been subjected to the quality control of market competition and the
       superior project management and supervision afforded by the triple layers of a
       Construction Supervision Engineer, by the Project Implementation Unit, and by
       the LVK's own staff, supplanted periodically by World Bank supervision visits.
       The incentives for quality control of equipment and civil works are arguably more
       conducive to higher quality than under Ukraine's previous command economy.
   · The financial risks are moderate. LVK has now reached a financial working ratio
       of about 0.8 which implies a satisfactory
   · By the same token, the Lviv City Government has been steadfast in its financial
       support of LVK as evidenced by the grant financing of an investment program
       parallel to that of the World Bank, and by the payment of the debt service under
       the World Bank loan.
   · The economic risks of the project are moderate. Ukraine's economy has steadily
       improved with high macro-economic growth rates since 2000. The fact that
       nearby Poland is an EU member is also positive factor for the economic prospects
       for Lviv and for the likely evolution of the population's income levels.
   · The social risks for the project are rated moderate given the essential character of
       LVK's water and wastewater services.
   · The political risks are rated as moderate. Ukraine has suffered considerable
       political turmoil at the central government level but this has hardly carried over to
       the Lviv political situation.    The water and wastewater project has received
       bipartisan political support from the Lviv City Council ever since project
       implementation improved from 2005 and onwards.
   · The project's environmental risks are moderate and are mitigated by careful
       environmental assessments of the project and the fact that the project was
       essentially one of rehabilitating environmentally worse performing assets.
   · The Government ownership risks are low as evidenced by the fact that both the
       local and central governments requested Additional Financing from the World
       Bank.
   · The institutional risks are assessed as moderate given the steady progress of the
       institutional strengthening program.
   · The Governance risks are moderate since the rehabilitation of the most critical
       sections of the water and wastewater systems is largely complete.
   · The exposure to National disasters is rated low.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance


(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

The Bank performance in ensuring Quality at Entry was rated "satisfactory." The project
design benefited from the Bank's sector study that was completed in 1995. Similarly, the
project design was well aligned with the CAS. The project was simple in the sense that
90% of the planned expenditure was for rehabilitation. However, on the negative side the
Bank pursued for too long the option of a management contract with a foreign private
operator although it became increasingly clear that the Client was opposed to such a
contract. The satisfactory rating for Bank performance during preparation agrees with
the rating from the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) that rated the Quality at Entry
satisfactory in an assessment in July 2001.

(b)     Quality of Supervision

The quality of the Bank's performance during supervision is rated satisfactory. The
technical and financial supervision was by two successive, Washington-based task
managers whereas the fiduciary aspects were supervised by Kiev-based Bank staff. The
background of the two task managers complemented each other. The first task manager
had a financial background and was supported by technical staff. This second task
manager had an engineering and procurement background and was supplemented by staff
specialized in finance and monitoring and evaluation. All in all, the relative stability in
task management benefited relations with the Borrower during the implementation period
and compensated for the internal political turmoil that characterized Ukraine during that
time. The Bank was responsive to client preferences as evidenced by the client's request
for a follow-up project under procedures of Additional Financing.          However, the
requested Additional Loan did not materialize since the Bank gave priority to attempting
a non-sovereign guarantee under the IFC Sub-National Development Program.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Given satisfactory ratings for both Bank performance during preparation and during
supervision the rating for Overall Bank performance is satisfactory.




                                              14

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a)     Government Performance

Government performance comprises the performance of the Lviv City Government and
the Central Government in Kiev. The rating of the former is rated "satisfactory" as
evidenced by the strong financial support provided to pay for a parallel investment
program and for making direct financial contributions to pay for debt service under the
Bank loan. The performance of the Central Government is rated moderately satisfactory
because of the substantial delays in signing and making the project effective.

(b)     Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

The performance of the Lviv Vodokanal that implemented and is now operating the
project is rated "satisfactory". The LVK performed satisfactorily within the constraints
imposed upon it by its dependence on the Lviv City Council for financial support and
ratification of requested tariff increases.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Given the satisfactory ratings for Borrower Performance with respect to the Government
Performance and the performance of the Implementing Agency the rating for Overall
Borrower Performance is satisfactory.

6.      Lessons Learned

Client Ownership: It is important for the Bank to carefully assess the merits of its
demands on the Borrower when there are clear signs of resistance. In the particular case
of the Bank's insistence that the Lviv Vodokanal employ a foreign, private management
operator it was obvious that the Client did not favor such a solution. The subsequent
substitute of a management contract by expensive, foreign management advisory services
was not well advised either given the explicit, strong reluctance of the Borrower to
employ a Management Operator. In middle-income countries where the development of
Bank business is not assured the Bank would benefit from being closely attuned to the
demands and preferences of prospective borrowers. By the same token, the Bank might
wish to consider longer-term client relationships as afforded by follow-up operations
since it is highly unlikely that reforms will be possible to define, let alone implement,
under one isolated operation.

Monitoring Indicators: The choice of performance indicators and the level of technical,
economic and financial analysis should be guided by the quality of baseline data. In the
particular case of water supply and wastewater projects the quality of production and
consumption data is suspect in the absence of widespread and careful metering. In the
case of the technical analysis such uncertainties in data argue in favor of flexible and
robust project designs as in rehabilitation projects. In the case of economic analysis it



                                               15

may be sufficient to concentrate on flexible least-cost analysis rather than engage in
economic cost-benefit analysis where the results could well be spurious when the
baseline data are of poor quality and subject to considerable change.

Subcontractor's qualifications should be clearly analyzed in the Bank's Standard
Bidding Documents: Project implementation was delayed approximately one year
during the construction stage of main contract.       The delay was largely due to the
inexperience of the main local subcontractor in the installation of water pipes in the city.
The construction was subsequently completed by another local contractor in 2007 who
was directly hired by the borrower and who was originally listed as a subcontractor of
the main contractor in the bid proposal. It is clear that the change in the subcontractor
between the bidding stage and the contract stage was a main reason of one-year delay in
the contract execution. This type of mistake can be avoided if the Bank's standard
bidding documents were to require an analysis of the subcontractor's minimum
qualifications and if only those subcontractors were allowed who would meet the
minimum qualifications in accordance with its respective scope of work.

License for Construction of Foreign Contractor: Another contract issue was that the
main contractor did not posses the license for carrying construction work in Ukraine,
which became an obstacle when the main contractor tried to carry out the construction
work in 2006 by bringing their own construction equipment in order to accelerate the
pipe installation work. The bidding document requires the contractor to acquire in its
name all permits, approvals and/or licenses from all local, state or national government
authorities or public service undertakings. However, LVK exempted the main contractor
from acquiring a license for construction in Ukraine. This mistake can be avoided if the
Bank's standard bidding document requires that the necessary permit always be acquired

                             Annex 2.Outputs by Component

The primary PDO was to "To improve accessibility and quality of the water supply at an
affordable level in Lviv, and to restore public confidence in the sector." Accordingly, the
project components were designed and implemented to make it possible to meet the PDO.
Specifically, the project components comprised about 90% of rehabilitation of the
existing infrastructure to increase the continuity of service ("the accessibility of service"),
the establishment of pressure zones to control and reduce excessive pressure ("the quality
of service") and expanded metering, replacement of wasteful electro-mechanical
equipment, and the establishment of pressure zones (all to increase the efficiency of
service, notably through reducing losses and wastage, thus reducing operating costs and
offering service "at an affordable level," and improving communications with customers
through the creation of a call center and making service improvements, both of which
contributed to "restoring public confidence in the sector." The planned and actual outputs
by the project's six components are detailed in the preceding Procurement Plan. In
physical terms the project accomplished the following:

1.     Initial Defined Investments

    · 21.7 km of water supply pipelines were replaced versus the planned 20 km.
    · 9 pumping stations were rehabilitated versus the planned 10. However, the
       Yanivska pumping station is currently being rehabilitated with LVK's own fund.
    · About 90 isolation valve nodes were installed.
    · 10 passenger and cargo vehicles; 15 tractor backhoes, 5 auto-cranes and 15 auto-
       trucks were purchased for emergency repairs and maintenance.

2.     Wastewater Investments

    · The pumping station at Wastewater Treatment Plant #2 were rehabilitated.
    · WWTP 1 and WWTP2 were rehabilitated including the aeration systems,
       clarifiers, and sludge disposal facilities as planned (SIDA financed component)
       and the commissioning of the both plants are planned between March 31 and
       April 15, 2008.
    · The detailed design of sludge digester will be carried out by SWECO with a grant
       from Nutek (3 million SEK) and LVK will seek to get the investment financing
       from donors.

       Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

               Comments by the LVK Director to the Lviv City Council

 Explanatory note to the "Water supply improvement in Lviv city transition to the
                                 24 hour supply" for 2008.


        Lviv city is geographically located in the heart of the Great European Watershed
with insufficient water production resources. Water to the city is supplied exclusively
from underground springs (17 well fields), located 20-110 km from the city.           The
designed capacity of the well fields is 452,000 m3/day. Actual water resources at well
fields amount to 580,000 m3/day. There are 182 wells, the depth of some reaches 250 m.

        Huge topographical differences up to 120 m requires the operation of 27 pumping
stations of 2nd, 3rd, and 4th step (the operation age of some of them is 20-100 years) and
23 local booster stations. Most of the mechanical and electrical equipment is exhausted
and some of it does not confirm to requirements of the hydraulic system. Considerable
amount of pumping stations requires reconstruction and the replacement of old
equipment by modern and more efficient equipment. The capacity of potable water
reservoirs is over 200,000 m3.

        Water produced from the well fields is supplied to the city via transmission mains
with length of 654 km with diameters up to 1400mm. The city water supply system has
been developing since 1901. Nowadays approximately 30% of water pipelines are in poor
technical condition.

        The next rather complicated and technologically important system element is the
city distribution network. Its length is: 850 km of street water supply networks, and 245
km of district and block networks.        Expert studies of local and foreign specialists
ascertained that 76% of city networks are in unsatisfactory technical condition. Annually
more than 5 thousand leakages are repaired in city water supply networks.

        According to the report of the Danish company COWI which carried out the
examination of actual condition of LCCE "Lvivvodokanal" infrastructure commissioned
by Danish Environmental Agency (DEA), the complete rehabilitation of water supply and
drainage systems of Lviv city, required about 600mln US dollars in 1996.

        Large topographical differences required the establishment of number of
hydraulic zones in city system, which needed improvement and renovation. Solution of
these problematic issues was the main aim of the "Water supply and waste water project
in Lviv city", financed by the World Bank loan.

        The priority tasks of the Project were to improve efficiency of functioning of
water supply system and water supply to city inhabitants in a short period and for a
reasonable price. This included the program of organizational, technological, and
technical re-equipment of LCCE "Lvivvodokanal", needed for implementation of



                                              26

efficient technologies, energy savings, loss reduction, increases of efficiency and
reliability of water supply and sewage water systems, which as a result should be
favorable to improvement of technical and economical condition of the enterprise.

        During 2007 communal enterprise "Lvivvodokanal" managed to resume
utilization of World Bank loan, what was almost interrupted in summer 2006. This
allowed the completion of all Project works: (i) to install and commission all 21,7km of
water pipelines: (ii) to finish rehabilitation of 9 pumping stations; (iii) to install all
isolation valve blocks which allowed for the first time to establish pressure zones in water
pipeline networks of the city.

        Furthermore, the reconstruction of pumping stations made it possible to decrease
electricity consumption by about 20mln kWh hours per year as compared to 2004, and
made possible a simultaneous rise of payment collection during current year let us settle
accounts in time with OJSC "Lvivoblenergo" for used energy sources even in conditions
of their constant cost rise and avoid disconnection of LCCE "Lvivvodokanal" units from
electrical supply.

        Thus, implementation of technical components of World Bank loan is the basis of
city water supply improvement. This lets us create few fundamental things, on which all
future actions will be based:

        a)     establishment of pressure zones
        b)     decrease of energy consumption
        c)     decrease of leakages due to replacement of part of wrecked water
               pipelines

        The technical and financial conditions of the enterprise do not allow to improve
rapidly water supply of the whole city, as such approach will include a number of risks,
which may diminish all efforts on uninterrupted water supply adjustments. First, it will
be necessary to supply additional quantity of uninterrupted water during rather long
period (four ­ five months), but in current conditions it will be extremely difficult to do it
due to the following reasons:

        1)     high breakdown rate of water pipelines
        2)     unsatisfactory technical condition of number of well fields
        3)     increase of electricity, which will be used for production, transfer and
               distribution of additional quantity of water, thus the considerable increase
               in payment for electricity
        4)     lack of efficient system of payment collection for rendered services in
               water supply and wastewater, based on the principle "service producer ­
               service provider."

        Taking into account the abovementioned, the optimal way to improve city water
supply is stage-by-stage solution of the problem in separate, the most technically
prepared micro regions, with minimum financial expenses and in order from the easiest to



                                            27

the most complicated. In particular, the next stage of city water supply improvement in
2007 was extension of schedule of water supply to Zaliznychnyy and Frankivskyy
regions and central part of the city. Only gradual solutions to the water supply
improvement problem will enable smooth and unproblematic increases of water supply
schedule, avoiding the need for the sharp increase in the amount of water produced and
supplied to the city. With this view the transition to extended water supply should be
conducted during warm season when water consumption is at its lowest.

       The most significant condition for introduction of the 24 hours water supply with
regard to all development scenarios is timely approval of economically justified tariffs
that will enable to pay for consumed electricity as well as pay interest and main part of
the loan.

       Exemption of the enterprise from payments on the World Bank loan at least
during the initial period of transition to the 24-hour supply is another crucial condition of
the program that will favor the inflow of the local LVK funds exclusively for pipeline
pumps replacement to ensure uninterrupted water supply and losses reduction.

       The third important condition for the program implementation is integrated
technical measures for 2008. The following principle has been taken as a basis:

       -        The understanding of the fact that the development budget and general
                city budget for the next year will exceed the one for 2007.
       -        The amount forecasted for technical needs of LCCE "Lvivvodokanal" will
                be accepted on the level of the current year with the increase coefficient
                1.2 ­ 1.3.
       -        The measures put forward for financing are of top priority and importance
                and thus do not represent the exhaustive list of what should be done.

       Those were the principles for the development of the proposed "Program of
improved water supply of Lviv city residence and transition to the system of 24-hour
supply" for 2008. The implementation of the program will result in considerable
improvement of water supply in the city and will lay down the foundation for securing
24-hour supply to all city residents.

       Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


Comments of SIDA Complementary to the Implementation, Completion and Results
Report (ICR) by the World Bank, February 2008.


Within the frame of the HELCOM Joint Comprehensive Action Program the Swedish
Government allocated substantial financing to reduce the pollution from "hot spots"
discharging to the Baltic Sea. Most of the financing has been channeled through Sida.
Unsatisfactory treated wastewater from Lviv is the only such "hot spot" in Ukraine and
has therefore been given high priority.

The participation by SIDA in improvement to the municipal wastewater treatment in Lviv
has been coordinated with the World Bank since 1998. A decision to finance
interventions in the two municipal treatment plants was based on an evaluation by
Swedish consultants leading to a decision to contribute SEK 48 million (equivalent to 6
MUS$ at the time of decision).

A Grant Agreement was signed in February 2002 with the Government of Ukraine
stipulating completion no later than June 2006 covering; a) rehabilitation of the aeration
system in WWTP 1 & 2; b) rehabilitation of clarifiers in WWTP 2; c) rehabilitation of
sludge dewatering units; and d) consultancy services. Local financing corresponding to
2.25 MUS$ was to supplement the Swedish contribution.

A design review in 2004 established the following priority components for Swedish
financing: a) flow and sampling equipment; b) screens; c) oxygen control equipment; d)
blowers; e) sludge dewatering equipment; f) consultancy services. The review report
included a sludge disposal strategy including a requirement for the Lviv Vodokanal
(LVK) to allocate a sludge disposal site acceptable to local environmental authorities
without negative impact on the environment.

The Swedish financed components, equipment and services, have been procured
according to the requirements in the Grant Agreement and within the amount made
available. However, the local financing has been subject to delays due to local budgeting
shortfalls and increased costs for the local components for civil and electrical works.
Originally 9 million Hrivna (UAH) was allocated through the municipal budget.
Additional allocations have had to be made leading to a total local financing of about 19
million Hrivna. The increased costs have also resulted in repeated local procurements.
The budget process in combination with repeated procurement for the local works has
delayed the implementation further aggravated by slow performance of local contractors.

As of February 2008, commissioning and handing over of the installations remains. The
commissioning is planned for late March although in consideration of past experience,
further delays can not be ruled out.




                                           29

Swedish consultants are monitoring the progress of work and quality of installations.
Reportedly the overall quality is good. The consultants have also been engaged to assist
in optimization of the operational performance of both wastewater treatment plants.

Although not yet completed, it is envisaged that the Swedish financed interventions will
reach the overall objective by enhanced treatment of the wastewater in Lviv thereby
satisfying the HELCOM action program.

In respect of the local environmental impact one issue remains unsolved. Despite that
LVK repeatedly been assuring that a strategic plan for minimizing the impact of sludge
disposal was to be prepared and submitted to SIDA, no such plan has been forthcoming.
LVK has no long term sustainable solution for the disposal of sludge. For the time being
they will store the dewatered sludge within the treatment plant sites. This is contradictory
to the obligation to address the adverse environmental impact of the project.
