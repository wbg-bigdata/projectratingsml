MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
INDIA
FOR THE UTTAR PRADESH POWER PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to India
for US$350 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would
be at the standard IBRD variable interest rate, and be repayable over 20 years,
including a five-year grace period. The loan would help finance a project
designed to alleviate power shortages, rehabilitate thermal generating facilities,
reduce energy losses, and improve operational efficiency and financial viability
in the power system of Uttar Pradesh, a State in northern India.
2.      Background.  The power sector plays a key role in meeting the energy needs
of the Indian economy. Through power generation, the sector contributes to
overall energy supply, and through its transmission and distribution network, it
provides widely dispersed industrial and agricultural consumers with access to
energy. As a result of the rapid growth of power demand, which grew at about 8% a
year during the past two decades, and the widely dispersed locations of power
consumers, power supplies have continuously fallen short of demand. Nationwide,
the power deficit is estimated to average about 1OZ. In India's Northern Region,
the deficit may be as high as 30%. These shortages result in severe disruptions
of industrial production and agricultural output. Power consumers, who can affort
it, often resort to investments in costly alternative sources of power.
3.      The central and state governmentL recognize the high cost of these power
shortages to the economy. They have attempted to eliminate these shortages
through a massive investment program in power generating capacity. More than 20Z
of total public investment resources are now allocated to the power sector. The
bulk, about two-thirds, of these resources have been traditionally allocated to
the expansion of power generating capacity. The remaining third, has been used
for investments in transmission and distribution, and the rehabilitation of power
plants. Delays in the implementation of new projects, underinvestment in
transmission and distribution as well as underutilization of existing power
plants, have been responsible for the slow progress in closing the power gap.
Budgetary constraints limit the feasibility of increasing the allocation of
investment resources for the power sector. The government is therefore pressing
for improvements in the operational efficiency and financial performance of State
Electricity Boards (SEBs), which account for more than 70% of India's power
generation.
4.      Uttar Pradesh is one of India's largest and most populated states.  It has
large coal reserves and a substantial hydroelectric potential. They have allowed
Uttar Pradesh to build large coal-fired thermal power plants in the south-eastern
part and hydroelectric power plants in the north-western part of the state.
However, much of the demand for power is concentrated in the south-western part of
the state, and like most other states in India, Uttar Pradesh failed to develop a
transmission and distribution system commensurate with the expansion of generating



-2-
capacities and power demand. As a result, the transmission system is overloaded,
and Uttar Pradesh has one of the highest system losses in India. In addition,
many of the power plants in Uttar Pradesh are operated inefficiently. This is due
to several factors: in part, it is the result of a gradual worsening of the
financial situation of the Uttar Pradesh Stata Electricity Board (UPSEB), which
led to inadequate maintenance, and in particular shortages of spare parts; in
part, it is the result of deficiencies in the design and manufacturing of the
power plants, and the poor quality of coal thermal power plants have to use.
5.      Rationale for Bank Involvement.  A theme common to many of the issues
constraining the development of India's power sector is the poor performance of
the SEBs which remain the weak link in India's power system. Bank involvement in
the power sector in India has therefore been evolving towards a more direct
asscoiation with individual SEBs where state-specific programs can be designed to
address areas of deficiency and where there is a commitment, at both the State and
institutional level, to improve operational efficiency and financial performance
of these utilities.
6.      The proposed project would be the first direct Bank operation with UPSEB,
a large, expanding, but institutionally and financially weak, electric utility in
an economically important State of India. UPSEB has a history of low operating
efficiency, poor quality of service, construction delays and cost overruns which
together have resulted in poor financial performance and a precarious financial
position. During project preparation, a comprehensive diagnosis of the
organization and operations of UPSEB was undertaken and agreement reached on a
detailed Action Plan, regarding the measures needed to improve the operational
efficiency, reliability of supply and financial performance. The proposed
project, therefore, represents the first attempt by the Bank to address
comprehensively -- through an Action Plen -- the several operational, managerial
and financial constraints to improving the operational performance of an important
State Electricity Board, and to help lay the basis for establishing a strong,
autonomous and commercially oriented electric utility.
7.      Project Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to: (a) alleviate
acute power shortages in Uttar Pradesh and the Northern Region; (b) enhance the
performance and efficiency of existing thermal power station and high voltage
transmission system; (c) introduce in the power utilities of the country a new
technology in power generation with the installation of fluidized bed boilers; (d)
promote the development of economic hydro resources and supplement coal resources
used for power generation; and (e) effect institutional, operational, and
financial improvements in UPSEB by implementing a comprehensive Action Plan.
8.      Project Description.  The proposed project comprises: (a) construction of
a 330 MW hydropower station near Srinagar on the Alknanda River, a tributary of
the River Ganga. The scheme includes a 70 m high and 200 m long concrete gravity
dam, intake structures, a sedimentation basin, about five km long channel, an
outdoor power house wit.. Ax 55 NW generating units and associated infrastructure
and auxiliaries; (b) resettlement, rehabilitation and compensatory afforestation
measures associated with (a); (c) installation of two fluidized bed boilers at the



-3-
Harduaganj thermal power station and modernization of the coal and ash handling
systems; (d) installation of an additional coal handling system at the Obra
thermal power station and the acquisition of wagons for coal transport from the
coal mine; (e) construction of about 430 kms of high voltage transmission lines
together with additional transformer capacity and associated te'-ommunication
facilities; (f) installation of around 2,000 energy meters; and (g) consulting
services and training for execution of the project and improvement of the
organisation and performance of the utility, in the context of the implementation
of the Action Plan. The Action Plan comprises a number of specific actions
(organizational improvement, planning, maintenance, training, billing, etc.) with
a specific timetable, aimed at improving operational efficiency, strengthening
project management, and bringing about the financial recovery of UPSEB.
9.      The total financing requirements for the project are estimated at
US$754 million equivalent, including interest during construction, with a foreign
exchange component of US$331 million (43.9%). A breakdown of costs, the financing
plan, and retroactive financing arrangements are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. Proposals for cofinancing of some of the project components
through either bilateral assistance or commercial agencies have been submitted to
GOI and UPSEB and are under consideration. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of the Bank Group operations in India are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. A map (IBRD No. 19911) highlighting the project is
attached. The Staff A-praisal Report, No. 7048-IN, daced May 23, 1988, is being
distributed separately.
10.     International Waterways Aspects.  The Government of Bangladesh, as a
riparian state, was informed on December 1, 1987, of the Bank's intention to
assist India in implementing the Srinagar hydro scheme, a component of the
proposed project. It was also advised of its design (exclusively for power
generation without any diversion of water), its operation (run-of-the-river with
daily regulation) and its location (some 1,500 km from the border with
Bangladesh). While raising some general concerns regarding water sharing of the
Ganga River flow, the Government of Bangladesh has not expressed any substantive
objection to the proposed project following the Bank's notification. Bank staff
have determined that for the reasons stated above, the project will have no
harmful effect on the quantity of water flow into Bangladesh.
11.     Environmental Aspects and Resettlement.  The environmental impact and the
resettlement of population dislocated by the proposed project, essentially limited
to the Srinigar hydro-scheme component, are relatively small due to the small size
of the areas to be either submerged or required for the construction work, and the
sparsity of the population in the valley -- 59 families will need to be resettled.
UPSEB has already started to undertake a compensatory afforestation plan.
Regarding resettlement, UPSEB has provided to the Bank a satisfactory plan, which
includes proposals for (a) adequate assistance and/or cash compensation for
relocation of those ousted in appropriate accommodation, and (b) for training and
assistance in small businesses, industries or trade which either already exist at
Srinagar or are likely to be developed in the context of the implementation of the



-4-
project. The Bank will regularly review progress made in implementing the
resettlement plan which should be complezed by December 31, 1992.
12.     Financial Aspects.  The impact of the Action Plan is expected to
significantly strengthen UPSEB's financial position in the following areas:
first, its increased capacity to generate funds will be reflected in: (a) a
growing percentage of its investment being financed with internally generated
funds; and (b) UPSEB's improved capacity to service its debt; second, the rate of
return will move from a negative to a positive value as a result of a more
efficient operation of its physical plant; third, UPSEB's liquidity position will
improve because of better management of its working capital; fourth,
rationalization of the utility's investment program will avoid spreading financial
resouces too thinly and contribute to a reduction in project comp'.etion time; and,
finally, UPSEB's capital structure will improve. Achieving this financial
recovery program implies regular annual tariff increases starting in 1990/91.
This operation, which addresses the most critical operational and institutional
deficiencies of the Board, is the first step in a longer term institutional
recovery process. The longer term consolidation of UPSEB's financial position
will require addressing financial policy issues and practices which are at least
partially outside its control, and are part of the Bank's ongoing sectoral
dialogue with GOI.
13.     Agreed Actions.  GOUP agreed to: (a) undertake specific actions under the
Action Plan regarding UPSEB's organization and technical and financial performance
that are under its responsibility; (b) eliminate, or cause to eliminate, before
March 31, 1989, the remaining arrears due to UPSEB, as of August 31, 1987, by GOUP
and its agencies for electricity consumption, and prepare, before December 31,
1988, a program to ensure that, from April 1, 1989 onwards, GOUP and its agencies
pay their electricity bills within 60 days; (c) implement the resettlement plan
needed as a result of the development of the Srinagar hydro scheme; and (d) onlend
to UPSEB the proceeds of the proposed loan at the standard interest rate it
charges for 'Loans made to its corporations and agencies, but not less than the
current rate of 10.25' p.a. with a repayment period of 20 years, including a grace
period of five years.
14.     In addition, GOUP agreed to cause UPSEB to: (a) implement the Action Plan
agreed with the Bank which includes the specific measures to be implemented
according to a detailed timetable. In order to ensure that the objectives of the
Action Plan are being achieved, the Bank will undertake, by December 1989, a full
review of the progress attained by UPSEB in implementing it. Lack of progress on
the substantive provisions of the Action Plan would be viewed by the Bank as a
serious matter which could affect further project implementation; (b) take all
measures necessary to ensure that in each financial year, commencing 1990/91,
UPSEB earns a rate of return on historical assets of at least 3X after interest
payment; this is estimated to be equivalent to about five to six percent on
revalued assets; (c) furnish to the Bank annual reports, beginning September 30,
1989, covering the monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement and compensatory
afforestation plan related to the Srinagar hydro scheme, and no later than
one-year before the expected completion of scheme, details of the arrangements for



-5-
inspecting and maintaining the dam and the associated structures to ensure their
continued safety; and (d) furnish to the Bank: (i) UPSEB's audited accounts
together with the Auditor's report within 12 months of the end of the financial
year for financial years 1987/88 and 1988/89, and within nine months for the
following financial years; (ii) quarterly progress reports, beginning
September 30, 1988, indicating the progress attained in implementing the measures
included in the Action Plan; and (iii) annual reports, beginning December 31,
1988, on the financial performance for the ensuing financial year, specifying the
actions to be taken to meet the financial targets and updated financial
projections for the following five years.
15.     Benefits.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are expected from:
(a) increases in the quantum of power supplied to consumers; (b) improvements in
the quality of power supply; (c) reduced system losses; and (d) greater efficiency
in the use of assets in the public power supply system. The least cost power
development program for the Northern Region, of which the proposed project is an
integral part, is calculated conservatively to have a quantifiable economic rate
of return of at least llX.
16.     Risks.  No unusual risks are foreseen in the execution of the project.
Technical risks would be minimized by the use of consultants where UPSEB has
inadequate experience. In regard to the institutional strengthening of the UPSEB
that is being sought under this project, there is some risk that a change in the
current management of UPSEB could slow down progress. While this risk exists, the
opportunity of regular reviews with UPSEB on the progress being made in
implementing the Action Plan will provide the Bank with an opportunity to monitor
the leadership being provided by UPSEB's management, and recommend changes as
appropriate.
17.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
