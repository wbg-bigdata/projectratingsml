MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A NORTHEAST RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
IN THE STATE OF MARANHAO
1.        The following report on a proposed rural development loan to the
Federative Republic of Brazil for US$84.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be repayable in 15 years on a fixed
amortization schedule, including 3 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate. It would help finance Brazil's Northeast Rural
Development Program (NRDP) in the State of Maranhao.
2.        Background.  Agriculture in Brazil has traditionally been the main
source of exports and employment, though a relatively small contributor to
GDP. In 1985, agriculture accounted for 13% of GDP, 30% of the economically
active population and 31% of total exports. Throughout the 1970s, there was
rapid expansion in Brazil's agriculture (5% per annum); during the recession
in the early 1980s, output and inves.ment stagnated and then recovered in
1984 and 1985. The performance of the sector in the 1970s masked sharply
disparate rates of growth among regions, farm types and individual crops.
3.        The Northeast of Brazil covers 18% of the country's total area and
has been the nation's foremost problem region since the late 1800s. In 1985,
the Northeast had a population of 39 million, or about 29% of the country's
total, growing at 2.3% per annum. Half the population lives in the rural
areas and over 50% of the work force is engaged in agriculture. Drought and
uncertain rainfall, highly skewed land distribution, illiteracy, endemic
diseases, and limited urban employment opportunities have resulted in high
levels of poverty and underemployment, particularly in rural areas. Despite
the constraints, Northeast agriculture continues to play an important role in
the national economy. The Northeast contributes about one-fifth of the total
value of Brazilian crop production; many regionally produced commodities
(cotton, sisal, cassava and sugar) represent significant shares of national
production.
4.        In 1982, the Government requested Bank assistance in preparing a
new regionwide rural development program, the Northeast Rural Development
Program (NRDP). This initiative was stimulated by the recognition that
previous rural programs had achieved limited results in alleviating poverty
and increasing agricultural production. The NRDP, simpler in design than
previous efforts supported by the Bank, focuses on eliminating key
constraints on small farmer development, such as land tenure insecurity,
drought vulnerability, and limited access to credit and use of modern
technology. The program is complemented by the Northeast Region Land Tenure
Improvement Project (Loan 2593-BR) which finances cadastral activities in all
ten Northeast states. It will be further complemented by a series of sector
projects in education, health, water supply and sanitation. Regional program
guidelines have established (a) unified and streamlined funding and
administrative procedures, and (b) mechanisms for increased beneficiary
participation and improved institutional performance.



- 2 -
5.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project would:  (a) increase
agricultural production and productivity; (b) generate income and employment
opportunities for the low-income rural families; (c) promote water resource
development and technology generation and diffusion to increase small
farmers' productivity; (d) increase community participation in all phases of
the development process; and (e) strengthen the State of Maranhao's capacity
to provide efficient agricultural services to small farmers.
6.        Project Description.  The proposed project would include:
construction of four state-managed small irrigation schemes totalling
about 765 ha and benefiting about 380 farm families; studies for possible
future irrigation projects; construction of about 255 simple water-supply
systems; construction of two fish hatcheries; adaptive agricultural research
and basic seed production; extension services to about 66,600 small farmers
and 6,400 inland fishermen; imnestment credit for about 21,700 farmers and
inland fishermen, including 2,900 farmers using irrigation; marketing support
services for private traders and small farmers; funding for community
subprojects; demarcation and protection of a natural reserve; project
administration; and training.   arerall, some 73,000 low-income rural
families in 58 municipalities of the State of Maranhao would benefit from the
project. Land cadastral and regularization activities w1".ich have been
initiated in 41 of the municipalities under the ongoing rural development
project would be completed and extended to all project municipalities under
the Northeast Region Land Tenure Improvement Project (Loan 2593-BR). Action
plans to safeguard Amerindian lands have been agreed upon.
7.        The project, to be carried out over eight years, provides funds for
civil works, equipment and furniture, rural investment credit, a development
fund for community subprojects, training, and related administrative and
operating costs on a declining basis. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$172.3 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US22.5 million (13%). Retroactive financing of about US$4.0 million would
be provided for project expenditures (other than agricultural credit)
incurred after September 30, 1986, but prior to loan signing. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 6136-BR dated May 26, 1987, is also attached.
8.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's lending strategy in
Brazil aims to promote and assist structural reform; to develop and maintain
essential infrastructure; to increase the productivity and improve the living
conditions of the rural and urban poor; and to protect the environment and
the local populations affected by the execution of investment projects. The
Government of Brazil attaches high priority to decreasing regional
disparities. Incomes in Northeast rural areas are less than 35% of the
national average. The NRDP, of which the proposed project is a part, forms a
central part of the Government's investment strategy to narrow the gap
between the Northeast region and the rest of the country and to alleviate
rural poverty. Moreover, appropriate safeguards for the environment and the



- 3 -
Amerindian population have been included in the project. Bank financing in
support of the Program has already been approved for six state projects, one
of which includes regional coordination activities, and the Northeast Region
Land Tenure Improvement Project.
9.        Agreed Actions. During negotiations, the Government agreed on the
following: (a) as conditions of loan effectiveness: (i) the two action
plans agreed to resolve conflicts in three Amerindian reservations and to
create a new protected area are being satisfactorily implemented, and the
demarcation of the Geralda/Toco Preto Amerindian Reservation has been
completed; and (ii) satisfactory reorganization and staffing of SPE and the
IrrigatLion and Rural Infrastructure Department within the State of Maranhao's
Secretariat of Rural Development and Irrigation (SDR-MA); (b) as a specific
condition of disbursement for each public irrigation subproject, proof of
land acquisition and satisfactory detailed engineering designs and settlement
plan; and (c) as other covenants: (i) availability of at least 301,000 ha by
March 31, 19P'>, and an additional 2.99,000 ha by March 31, :990, for
redistribution to project beneficiaries; and (ii) satisfactory cost recovery
provisions for state public irrigation and domestic water supply.
10.       Justification.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from increases in agricultural production as a result of: (a)
increased productivity through better cultivation practices; (b) crop
diversification; and (c) expansion of the cropped area through irrigation and
increased use of animal traction. At full development, about 80% of the
value of yearly incremental marketable production would come from subsistence
crops, vegetables and fruits, 13% from livestock and fish and 7% from
extractive products (babassu nuts); the internal rate of return is estimated
at 14%. Improved domestic water supply and community activities would also
provide substantial benefits to the rural population, especially women.
Expanded agricultural activities would create employment equivalent to some
27,000 man-years annually. Actions carried out during the project would
safeguard Amerindian lands and would also protect the environment. Moreover,
improved farming practices, soil conservation, and the demarcation and
protection of the Mirador Park would have a beneficial impact on the
environment.
11.       Risks.  Possible risks include: (a) insecure land tenure;
(b) inefficient delivery of project services; (c) lack of sufficient
interinstitutional cooperation; (d) persistence of slash-and-burn shifting
cultivation; and (e) delays and shortfalls in counterpart funding and
credit. The project has been designed so as to minimize these risks.
Progress will be closely followed by Bank staff through review of annual
operating plans and improved supervision, monitoring and evaluation.
Implementation of the Northeast Region Land Tenure Improvement Project and
the Government's agrarian reform would increase land tenurs security.
Streamlined administrative procedures, measures for instiLutional
strengthening and technical assistance for selected agencies would impro7e
efficiency and project coordination. Crop diversification and intensified
technology generation and diffusion would help farmers gradually eliminate
traditional slash-and-burn shifting cultivation. The Government adopted new
measures in 1986 to ensure the timely availability of counterpart funds and



credit. In addition, the regional scope of the Northeast Program and the
support the Program enjoys among government and local leaders should help
secure adequate funding and satisfactory implementation of the proposed
project.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
