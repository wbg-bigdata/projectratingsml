F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The project's global objective is to sustainably conserve the biological diversity and
ecological integrity of selected forest, wetland, steppe and alpine ecosystems that are
representative of Turkey's four major bio-geographical zones, which include the Black
Sea and Caucasian mountain region, the Central Anatolian plateau, and the European and
Mediterranean regions. GEO was not modified during project, but key indicators were
realigned.

  The project's development objective is to establish effective intersectoral, participatory
planning and sustainable management of protected areas and natural resources at four
selected biodiversity conservation demonstration sites and build capacity at the national
level to facilitate replication of these activities at priority conservation sites throughout
Turkey.

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
and Key Indicators and reasons/justifications
The project's Global Environment Objectives were not formally revised. GEO Indicators
were modestly realigned during the MTR to provide a clearer framework for monitoring
performance.

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design


1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)
Turkey is a high biodiversity country and ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1996.
It subsequently prepared a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (BSAP) which pointed out that
most biodiversity is outside of protected areas, and biodiversity within protected areas has been
historically poorly managed in favor of resource intensive uses (tourism, forestry, grazing). This project
was an effort to introduce new management approaches, to shift the balance more strongly in favor of
biodiversity conservation, and came at a good time to help Turkey move forward in adopting European-
wide standards for nature protection. The project's four principal sites were situated in the Global 200
Ecoregions identified by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and high priority replication sites were selected
drawing on national expertise in a highly participatory process.

In regard to the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), at the time the project was prepared, project
interventions addressed a number of strategic actions identified in the CAS, e.g.: (i) strengthening the
policy, regulatory, management and monitoring capabilities of the MEF; (ii) conducting public awareness
campaigns and promoting stakeholder participation in project preparation, implementation and
enforcement; and (iii) involving stakeholders in formulating and implementing a natural resource
conservation strategy to address legal, policy, and public awareness issues.


1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The project's global objective was to sustainably conserve the biological diversity and ecological integrity
of selected forest, wetland, steppe and alpine ecosystems that are representative of Turkey's four major
bio-geographical zones, which include the Black Sea and Caucasian mountain region, the Central
Anatolian plateau, and the European and Mediterranean regions. The project's development objective was
to establish effective intersectoral, participatory planning and sustainable management of protected areas
and natural resources at four selected biodiversity conservation demonstration sites and build capacity at
the national level to facilitate replication of these activities at priority conservation sites throughout
Turkey. The key indicators outlined in the Appraisal document were:
a) Reduced rate of decline of biodiversity, habitats and plant communities at project sites.
b) No increase in adverse impacts of resource use (grazing, forest products etc) on biodiversity in project
    sites.
c) Decrease in destruction of natural formations and cultural sites within project sites.
d) Decrease in uncontrolled/unplanned construction within and around project sites.
e) No increase in percentage of area degraded by tourism impacts at project sites.
f) Increase in public support for biodiversity conservation at national and local level.
g) Legal and regulatory framework for biodiversity conservation established.
h) Improvement of social indicators linked with the use of natural resources at project sites.


1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The GEO was not revised. The project's Key Indicators were realigned (though not formally revised)
following the Midterm Review (MTR) more accurately to capture the project's likely accomplishments,
and to attenuate the highly aspirational (but often unmeasurable) targets outlined in the original Key
Indicators (see Section 2.3). Project performance ratings were downgraded as a result of the MTR. The
realignment of the Key Indicators was judged to have been necessary to enable to project team to focus
more clearly on attaining clear results and replicable outcomes.




                                                         1

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as captured
in the GEO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from the project)
The primary target groups identified in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) were government agencies
responsible for biodiversity conservation and forest management, including staff of Ministry of Forestry
(MoF), the Ministry of Environment (MoE) (which later merged into the Ministry of Environment and
Forestry, MEF) and the Ministry of Culture (MoC) who were expected to benefit from improved capacity
building and new institutional mechanisms to manage natural resources. Local beneficiaries at the site
level were expected to include communities, local organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations
(NGOs) and the private sector, who were expected to benefit directly (albeit modestly) as recipients of
small grants, and because project activities were expected to improve local management and use of
natural resources.


1.5 Original Components (as approved) The Project included the following three components:
Component 1: Strengthening the National Framework for Biodiversity Conservation (US$ 3.29
million) was to be achieved through: (i) a participatory review and development of a strategy for
rationalizing the legal framework for biodiversity conservation, including removal of overlapping sectoral
legislation and policy, and adjustment of other legislation impacting on biodiversity; (ii) strengthening the
institutional capacity to develop a national network of protected areas and to replicate the experience of
effective participatory protected area management systems developed at the four project sites under
Component 2; (iii) establishing a system to monitor the status of biodiversity and conservation initiatives
throughout the country; (iv) developing and implementing a prioritized national strategy and targeted
action plan for raising the awareness of key stakeholders and the general public about the importance,
urgent needs and opportunities for biodiversity conservation in Turkey; and (v) demonstrating how
biodiversity issues could be incorporated in the forest management planning process at three of the four
project sites.

Component 2: Developing Prototypes for Effective Protected Area Management (US$ 7.69 million) was
to entail establishing innovative systems for conservation management at the project's four pilot sites.
This was to be achieved through: (i) building Protected Area Management Authority (PAMA) staff skills,
developing protected area management planning systems, including exploring mechanisms for generating
and retaining revenues at the sites, and providing equipment and facilities, including visitor interpretation,
educational and/or community centers; (ii) preparing protected area management plans in a participatory
manner and guided by baseline ecological and socio-economic surveys and biodiversity monitoring
systems that the project was to establish. The monitoring systems was to provide periodic feedback to
protected area management staff on the status of ecosystems and their biodiversity, particularly in relation
to existing and anticipated threats such as tourism impacts, grazing and the use of forest or wetland
resources; (iii) building local support for biodiversity conservation through a public awareness and
education program targeted at key stakeholder groups; (iv) facilitating establishment of community based
mechanisms, such as small grant schemes or revolving funds, to support conservation-linked development
and reduce unsustainable use of shared resources such as forest and wetland products and grazing.
Eligibility criteria and procedures for awarding grants/funds was to be developed early in project
implementation, in consultation with local stakeholders, and approved by the Bank prior to disbursement
of funds; (v) guiding the development of environmentally responsible tourism to emphasize linkages
between conservation and benefits for local stakeholders; and (vi) establishing collaborative mechanisms
to ensure biodiversity conservation is incorporated into local sectoral and land use plans.

Component 3: Project Management and Monitoring (US$ 0.56 million) was to include provision of
equipment, and covered incremental expenses associated with implementation of the project by the
Project Management Team (PMT) at the national level. The PMT was to oversee and support



                                                       2

implementation of all project activities in accordance with agreed monitorable indicators. It was to work
closely with Protected Area Management Authority (PAMA) staff at the four sites, and with agency staff
responsible for implementing project activities at the national level, and was to develop and monitor work
plans for all project activities.


1.6 Revised Components
The original components were not revised, but activities were redesigned as a result of discussions during
the Midterm review, with a much stronger focus on outreach and engagement of the national conservation
community and with a clearer emphasis on local participation in management plan preparation in an effort
to develop clearer priorities for local management teams. The original strategy of supporting development
of a centrally-located Replication Unit was dropped following the MTR, because it was largely
ineffective, in favor of a wider replication strategy which involved tapping into a national network of
biodiversity conservation specialists.


1.7 Other significant changes
The project was originally designed to be implemented over a shorter time period and with a tight focus
on the four pilot sites and with national-level supporting activities. The project became effective in 2000
with an expected closing date of September 30, 2006. It was extended twice and closed on September 30,
2008, with most investments completed and all funds having been disbursed. The first extension request
resulted from the need to complete preparation of the protected area management plans, and to launch
various civil works activities. The second extension request was needed because of long delays in issuing
the necessary permits for civil works in Sultan Sazli i National Park. The extended duration of the project
was invaluable because it allowed time for fuller local participation in management plan preparation, and
for enabling replication at new sites. The use of project resources to initiate replication activities at nine
new sites provided a significant opportunity for uptake and implementation country-wide of good practice
guidelines developed under the project. As a result of the MTR, one of the significant changes in the
project involved dropping construction of park facilities at Köprülü Kanyon National Park, because the
government and mission concluded that the focus of attention on civil works in the park was diverting
attention from far more pressing concerns. Funds were reallocated to consultancies and training.
Particularly as Turkey began to address its pre-Accession agenda, project activities converged on the
priorities outlined in the EU nature protection acquis.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes


2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigations
identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)
The project was prepared with a $350,000 Project Development Facility (PDF)-B Grant from the Global
Environment Facility (GEF), which became effective in October 1997. This was the first operation of its
kind supported by the Bank in Turkey, and there were few lessons on which the project's design could be
built. The Bank's rural portfolio was increasingly being driven by interests in community participation
(cf. the East Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation Project), and so this interest contributed importantly to the
concepts underlying participatory protected area management plan preparation. The overall design of the
project was highly innovative, but was ambitious given the institutional and legal context for nature
protection in Turkey and the challenges of introducing new management planning and practices into a
traditionally conservative sector. Prior to the project, Turkey's system of protected area management
planning was fundamentally top-down and driven by technocratic concerns and approaches, which in turn
were rationalized in the policy and legal framework­ offering few opportunities within the legal
framework for introducing participatory planning. The four project sites were representative of different
biogeographic realms but also covered a range of very different institutional and sectoral challenges,
which required cooperation (as well as institutional reform) at the highest department levels. Moreover
many of the issues and pressures to be addressed at project sites were not limited to threats from local



                                                       3

communities but involved powerful interests associated with forestry, tourism and water use. Project
design under-estimated the manageability of many of the issues i.e. some of the objectives that were
identified for specific project sites were (and continue to be) far beyond the capacity or influence of the
PAMAs and even the General Directorate of Nature Conservation and National Parks (GDNCNP) to
manage. Risk mitigation did not feature strongly in preparation. It is in some respects quite remarkable
that Government chose to proceed with implementation anyway. To some extent, the project was
eventually seen to be an agent of change, and provided unprecedented opportunities for the Ministry to
build on and learn from international best practice. This became particularly relevant with growing
interest in aligning Turkey's policy and legal framework for protected area management more closely
with the EU.


2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions taken,
as applicable)
The way the project was designed influenced early implementation. Early in implementation, PAMAs
focused on some of the most difficult and intractable (but obvious) problems e.g. the early focus on
controlling mass tourism and rafting at Köprülü Kanyon, rather than on easier "wins" with upland
communities in terms of participatory management. The project team was heavily reliant on the advice of
various specialists hired to assist in capacity building for management plan preparation, and they too
focused on these difficult issues, clearly underestimating the ability to tackle them. The outcome was that,
combined with a slow project start-up period, relatively little was achieved during the first 3 years of
implementation. A new government was elected in late 2002, and the Bank and new senior Management
in the Ministry engaged earnestly in tackling some of implementation problems which were plaguing the
project. The MTR was carried out in October 2003, ratings for Implementation Performance and for
meeting Development Objectives were downgraded as a result, and the project lapsed into problem status.
In conjunction with the new Government's interest in rectifying the situation, the MTR provided an
opportunity to refocus the project on meeting more achievable targets at individual sites and on a more
coherent program overall. A series of short term targets were agreed at the Midterm, which were thought
to be critical for success. Most of the changes outlined by the MTR were ultimately endorsed by the
Government, and resulted in a significant turn-around in project performance yielding some important
outcomes at national and site levels. In particular a radically different and very successful approach to
replication was adopted, which has led to much greater emphasis on building a learning network of
Turkish conservation practitioners (including non-government partners), production and dissemination of
excellent guidelines and source book materials, and active replication of good practices at nine new sites.
The well-organized and highly participatory National Meeting on Biodiversity and Protected Area
Management held in May 2006 played a catalytic role in this process. Overall project performance ratings
were upgraded in December 2004, and remained Satisfactory until the ICR mission. Four deficiencies
were noted by the ICR mission ­civil works in Sultan Sazli i were incomplete, long standing concerns
about inadequate staffing in project sites which had never been fully resolved, the fact that only one of 4
management plans for the pilot sites had been formally approved, and the inability to finalize legislation
which had been drafted with project support. Noting the project's considerable achievements in other
areas, the ICR mission recommended that overall performance should be downgraded to MS, to reflect
these deficiencies. By the time the project closed, some months after the ICR mission, only 1 of the four
deficiencies ­ construction at Sultan Sazli i ­ had been satisfactorily addressed.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The project was originally designed with very broad and ambitious indicators, without much clarity about
how to monitor progress and outcomes. The Key Indicators outlined at Appraisal were in many respects
highly aspirational (certainly not atypical for GEF operations at the time). No baselines were identified at
Appraisal, and indeed, the capacity to prepare these baselines was largely non-existent and eventually
became central to preparation of the protected area management plans. Several of the Key Indicators were
extremely difficult to measure in the first place, and required systematic data collection. For example, it



                                                       4

was highly unlikely that changes in biodiversity (meaning changes in species diversity and in species
endemism) were likely to be evident over the relatively short life of the project, and the suggestion that
this should be a Key Indicator was entirely unrealistic. Similarly, the idea that the project would monitor
the impacts of resource use (grazing, forest extraction, etc.) on biodiversity, were also unrealistic. Long
term changes are of course important in this regard, and the project has put in place the capacity to
monitor them. Short term changes in many of the indicators outlined in the PAD, over the several years
the project was being implemented, were not entirely relevant because no baselines were available,
because changes were likely not to be detectable over short periods, and because of the problem of
attributing changes to project interventions.

Particularly with the emergence of an emphasis on developing `Results Frameworks' in the Bank, the
project's Key Indicators were retrofitted into a clearer framework for monitoring performance, and in a
way which reflected the actual scope of the project, the baselines which were available (or which were
needed), and the evolving institutional and legal framework for protected area management in Turkey.
Outcomes against this matrix are summarized in Annex 2. The framework is in some respects very
qualitative, but this in turn reflects the system-wide changes in thinking and in institutional approach the
project was seeking to catalyze.

Protected area management effectiveness: A significant innovation in performance monitoring was
introduced during the MTR. The so-called Protected Area Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool
(METT) was originally designed by the Bank to meet GEF's own concerns about performance
monitoring. The METT was designed to assess performance at the site-level against 6 criteria for
protected area management effectiveness identified by the World Commission on Protected Areas. The
Bank translated and piloted the METT into Turkish, and then developed a graphic scoring and reporting
system so that performance could be monitored over time. The results from the METT at the four pilot
sites are summarized in Annex 7. It continues to be used on a regular basis as a self-assessment tool.
Baselines have been established at all the replication sites. The METT strongly suggests that protected
area management effectiveness has improved significantly during and as a result of the project, though it
also has identified key areas of weakness (particularly with respect to management plan approval,
implementation, and staff deployment). GDNCNP intends to continue to use the PA METT consistently
to monitor management effectiveness beyond the project lifetime to identify future management needs.
This monitoring will also be useful for reporting on the Protected Area program of work of the
Convention on Biological Diversity.

In conjunction with preparation and field testing of the METT, the Bank mobilized Austrian Trust Funds
to finance preparation (in partnership with WWF Turkey and Austria) of a system-wide assessment of
Turkey's protected area management network, to identify overall strengths and weaknesses in the system.
This Assessment (the so-called Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management,
RAPPAM), finalized in June 2005, developed recommendations which were of great relevance for the
project's replication strategy.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)
The project was subject to normal Bank safeguards policies. Where local communities were utilizing
resources unsustainably within the protected areas, the project encouraged behavior change to more
appropriate management models and sustainable livelihoods through zoning arrangements and support for
pilot initiatives under the Small Grants Program. Protected area zoning was agreed in a fully participatory
manner in consultation with local stakeholders. Long delays were encountered in finally launching the
Small Grants Program, because of regulatory constraints which prevented the project from providing
Grants. These were eventually overcome, and the SGP was rolled out, completed, and evaluated in a very
effective and efficient manner. Protected area managers worked hard to ensure that allocation of small




                                                       5

grants addressed local needs but was consistent with conservation objectives, including a focus on more
sustainable harvesting of forest resources and water resources.

Overall fiduciary compliance was quite good, though until sometime after the MTR, commitments were
slow to be made and slow to disburse because of the multiple approvals which were required. There were
also significant delays encountered because most approvals had to be provided from the Ministry in
Ankara, rather than at the field level. The Ministry worked hard to accommodate changes in the system to
provide for greater decentralized management of project funds, and this yielded good outcomes.
Management plans are being aligned with the Ministry's own budget processes to ensure that financing
would be available for their implementation. Audits were consistently without qualifications.

Vehicles were procured in several large ICB packages. The idea had been to procure vehicles for pilot and
replication sites all at once. But because of delays in launching replication activities, 4WD vehicles were
available in surplus. These were inappropriately allocated to various officials in MEF. The Bank objected
to this practice, and MEF eventually reallocated vehicles to the four pilot sites, until replication activities
were fully underway.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by present
operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and
next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)
The project has established a strong foundation for improved protected area management as discussed
below. Long-term sustainability and impact of the replication strategy will depend critically on
mainstreaming into the public expenditure program and into institutional processes. This will require
strong leadership at the national and provincial levels to ensure that annual work plans, budgets and
staffing arrangements support implementation of the site management plans. It is encouraging that
provincial directorates and local authorities at two sites (Sultan Sazli i and Köprülü Kanyon) stressed
their commitment to support implementation of the management plans. I neada however remains a site
of concern, because of its recent designation as a national park, and the lack of adequate staffing for this
new role (it had initially been under the mandate of the General Directorate of Forestry, rather than
GDNCNP). With regard to replication of good practice, it is encouraging that replication efforts have
already begun at nine additional sites, with strong local support, and that the Küre Mountains site has
received a follow-up Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant., Sustainability is also viewed from, both
in terms of institutional ownership and support at the national level and in relation to progress with
approval and implementation of management plans at the four pilot sites. Finally, sustainability will be
greatly enhanced as Turkey adopts various nature protection measures as required under the EU acquis.
Overall sustainability is rated as Moderately Likely.


3. Assessment of Outcomes


3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
The project's global and development objectives, design components and implementation activities
remain fully consistent with (and indeed have helped to shape) both Turkish national and global
environmental management priorities and reflect strategic objectives and activities identified in the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) at the time of preparation. They remain highly relevant to the
current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) priorities in relation to environment and natural resource
management, and to increasing the quality and effectiveness of public services. Particularly following
Government's increased emphasis on alignment with EU policies, institutions, and programs, the project
was catalytic in introducing global best practices in protected area management, and in providing support
for aligning Turkey's legal framework for nature protection with the EU's. Support for development of
the Biodiversity Information Management System (BIMS) strongly complemented activities which



                                                       6

Turkey will need to carry out to implement measures related to the EU Natura 2000 system, and the
project's Small Grants Program (SGP) closely approximates various agri-environment measures
supported by the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (Pillar 2).


3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in
Annex 2)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The project has been Moderately Satisfactory in achieving its global environmental objective, i.e. to
sustainably conserve the biological diversity and ecological integrity of selected forest, wetland, steppe
and alpine ecosystems in Turkey. The project made major strides in advancing biodiversity conservation
planning in four sites within the major bio-geographical zones (the Black Sea and Caucasian mountain
region, the Central Anatolian plateau, and the European and Mediterranean regions). There is still some
work to be done in terms of putting in place physical conservation measures on the ground and the legal
framework and institutional processes need to be implemented. These are necessary to ensure sustainable
conservation of the biological diversity and ecological integrity of Turkey's critical ecosystems.

National Legislation. The project made good progress overall in strengthening the institutional and legal
framework for biodiversity conservation. Considerable progress has been made in rationalizing the legal
framework for biodiversity conservation and in harmonizing Turkish legislation with EU directives on
Environmental Assessment, Birds and Natural Habitats. Draft Protected Area legislation has been
prepared, following intensive public consultations with key stakeholders. Although the draft was
completed in 2005 after a highly participatory process, enactment is still pending. The draft is now under
review at the highest levels in MEF and, informally, by the Parliamentary Committee for Environment. It
is still uncertain how the draft may be adapted to accommodate particular economic activities (such as
mining and tourism). Proposed exemptions could compromise PA conservation objectives. The delay in
passing the law has had major impacts on subsequent implementation and effectiveness of many project-
initiated activities e.g. passage and implementation of management plans, the BIMS and cooperation
between the GDNCNP and GDF.

Forest management. Much of Turkey's biodiversity lies outside the protected area network but within
the forest estate. As part of improving overall biodiversity management, the project piloted the
preparation of biodiversity-friendly forest management plans at three sites (I neada, Köprülü Kanyon and
Camili). This intervention was timely since it coincided with new policies and directives on forest
management with more limited exploitation of State forests. A new Forestry regulation has been approved
and biodiversity management will be incorporated within all new forest management plans country-wide
as soon as the technical orders for implementation are approved.

Protected Area Management at Demonstration Sites. The project has been successful in introducing
international good practice in participatory management planning for protected areas and has led to an
attitudinal change in conservation management practices in Turkey. The participatory approach has been
enhanced through implementation of the SGP at project sites and is reflected in greatly improved
relationship between the GDNCNP and communities. Camili was declared Turkey's first UNESCO
Biosphere Reserve, as a result of project efforts, and 3000 hectares of the I neada conservation area have
been declared a National Park. Four management plans have been prepared for Camili, I neada, Sultan
Sazli i and Köprülü Kanyon, but at the end of the project, only one of these had been approved (Sultan
Sazli i in March, 2008). Although there have been considerable investments in consultation and
participatory planning, these protected areas are still understaffed and there is little sign of effective
implementation on the ground due to delayed approval of site management plans. These delays are related
to the long delay in approving the new legislation which has created an atmosphere of uncertainty in
regard to protected status and management at the site level. Anecdotal evidence from site visits suggests
that communities and local government authorities are now highly supportive of the protected areas and



                                                       7

that strategic support through the SGP has been key for building good will and engaging local
stakeholders in protected area planning and zoning of the protected areas.

Capacity Building. Capacity building has been a key outcome of the project. Excellent progress has been
made in strengthening institutional capacity to develop, plan and manage a national protected area
network, both within government institutions and, more broadly, among the NGO and the national
conservation community. The project has established good partnerships between government, NGOs, and
local academics to strengthen conservation practice. It has been highly successful in introducing new
protected area planning and management practices through development and dissemination of good
practice guidelines, a high profile and well-attended National Protected Area conference and active
replication at priority conservation sites. A key factor in sustainability will be the extent to which these
good practices are fully internalized into MEF and GDNCNP. The project has built a critical body of
expertise in the PAMAs which can help in this process.

Biodiversity Information and Outreach. A national Biodiversity Information Management System
(BIMS) has been established in partnership between MEF and a consortium of national NGOs. A useful
database has been established which could provide the platform for monitoring biodiversity trends
nationally. Although the database has been populated with species data it is not yet being used actively to
monitor biodiversity at project sites. Maintaining and updating such a database will require strong
institutional and financial support. Some questions also remain concerning the sustainability and
institutional home for the BIMS. The BIMS addresses an important part of the EU nature protection
acquis, and its sustainability will be enhanced because of this. A national public awareness strategy was
developed and some good quality outreach materials were prepared and distributed. Unfortunately it is
difficult to quantitatively assess the change in public perception and support for the protected areas
because no baseline attitude surveys were carried out.

Sectoral issues. The four demonstration sites illustrate a range of sectoral challenges. Good progress
seems to have been made in working with the forestry sector both within, and beyond, protected area
boundaries but threats from other sector interests such as water, agriculture, tourism and mining remain.
Water management is a concern at three of the project sites and is probably one of the greatest threats to
biodiversity across Turkey. While the PAMA at Sultan Sazli i has been able to engage local support for
new water releases into the wetland area, the annual water flow into this Ramsar site remains insufficient
fully to maintain and restore ecological viability. Both I neada and Köprülü Kanyon are also under threat
from potential pipeline projects to draw off water supplies on which the ecosystems depend. Resolving
these water management challenges is far beyond the scope of the individual PAMAs and will require
strong political will and support at the highest ministerial level to resolve these issues with other sectoral
ministries and provincial authorities.

Replication. The project has made excellent progress in replicating good practice through the national
conference, the Biodiversity Learning network and publication of good practice guidelines and protected
area management tools in Turkish. Replication of new management practices has begun at nine high
priority conservation sites which have been "twinned" with the four demonstration sites. Each project
PAMA has been paired with replication sites with similar environmental characteristics. The nine
replication sites are Amanos Mountains, Ere li Marshes, Sinop Sarikum, the K§re Mountains, Kovada,
Yazili Kanyon, Tuzla Lake, Acarlar Longos Forest Area, and Borcka/Karagöl Nature Park. Activities in
each replication site are underway to varying degrees. All nine sites have benefited from support from the
project for the last two years and are undertaking participatory planning, involving communities, local
authorities and NGOs. Particularly because of Turkey's need to greatly expand the area under formal
protection (currently around 6 percent) to be more consistent with the average among EU countries (15
percent), the replication strategy provides an important framework for the future.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost, and
comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)
Not applicable. The project was a stand-alone GEF project with a GEF grant and counterpart funding
from Government of Turkey. At the time the project was designed neither financial nor economic
analyses were required, so standard assessments of cost effectiveness or efficiency were not calculated,
and would be extremely difficult to assess ex-post. Having said this, this was a very small operation by
Bank standards. Although it was management intensive because of the nature of the investment, it was in
many respects a very low-cost high-impact GEF project.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of GEOs, and efficiency)
The project has made considerable progress since the MTR in 2003 when overall performance was rated
Unsatisfactory. Project performance has improved considerably, both at national and at sites levels, in
terms of implementation performance and in meeting the project's global objectives. At project
completion, however, two of seven expected outcomes have not yet been attained and the project global
and development objectives were not sufficiently realized. Problems still remain with staffing issues at
individual sites and lack of institutionalization within GDNCNP of the management models initiated
under the project. Overall project implementation is therefore rated as Moderately Satisfactory (MS).


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Although the project was not originally designed with explicit poverty, gender or social development
objectives or outcomes, some of its participatory planning and small grants-based activities had positive
impacts in these areas. For example, the participatory processes encouraged by the project in drafting the
nature protection and biodiversity law and in preparing the protected areas management plans built
greater social cohesion and support at the local level for the project's conservation objectives. The
judicious use of small grants to encourage local initiatives in ecotourism (e.g. guest houses), public
awareness-raising (e.g. educational materials, NGO activities), and relevant income-generating activities
(e.g. beekeeping, animal husbandry, customary craft production) played a larger role in local social
development, gender sensitivity and poverty alleviation than had originally been anticipated. As a result,
project outcomes included support from villages and populations that had been initially hostile to
establishment of protected area management (e.g. Camili, Sultan Sazli i, and Köprülü Kanyon), active
participation of NGOs in promoting conservation objectives (e.g. I neada), natural resource-based
economic opportunities where none existed before (e.g. Camili, Köprülü Kanyon), and increased
productive opportunities for women/educational opportunities for children (e.g. Sultan Sazli i, Köprülü
Kanyon).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)
The project made uneven progress in changing relevant MEF institutions at the national and local levels
and in strengthening long-term capacity to ensure sustainable management of Turkey's protected areas
and biodiversity resources. At the national level, the project succeeded in incorporating biodiversity
conservation considerations into GDF's planning and management processes for forest reserves (i.e. the
revised forest planning regulation), but it did not fully institutionalize these considerations into
GDNCNP's planning and management processes for protected areas (i.e. only one management plan has
been approved for a single project protected area, rather than multiple plans for both project and non-
project sites). At the local level, the project never fully succeeded in changing MEF's approach to
managing protected areas. After eight years of project assistance, the PAMA model of site-specific,
dedicated teams for protected area management has not really been institutionalized. Site management
continues to suffer from chronic understaffing, splintered management responsibility, legal/regulatory



                                                        9

uncertainty, and limited financial resources. While the project succeeded in reinforcing managerial
capacity in the PMT and in the PAMAs (which were, ultimately, project-created institutions), it remains
questionable whether the project substantively improved wider capacity in MEF's critical institutions (i.e.
GDF and GDNCNP) for protected area management and biodiversity conservation.

At the pilot site level, however, the project did succeed in strengthening long-term capacity for managing
protected areas. After receiving project-financed capacity building, the small, but very dedicated, local
teams at the four project sites now exhibit a technical and managerial capacity not seen in Turkey before
the project. Furthermore, they have used this new capacity to replicate good practices in protected area
planning/management and biodiversity conservation at nine additional "replication" sites throughout the
country, collectively accounting for around a third of Turkey's protected areas.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
One significant, unintended positive impact of the project was its benefit for the environmental NGO
community in Turkey. Though not specifically identified as a project objective or outcome, the high level
of collaboration with the NGO community helped to build NGO capacity; and this will be one of the
lasting outcomes of the project. The project's collaboration with NGOs included direct contracts for
provision of technical assistance (e.g. WWF at I neada), consultations on the draft nature protection and
biodiversity legislation, and participation in the protected area management planning processes at each of
the four project sites and replication sites. A specific capacity-building initiative for NGOs grew out of
the public awareness program included in project component 1. A strategy and action plan for NGO
development was prepared through a broadly participatory process (e.g. 11 national and 8 local NGOs)
and set a new standard in Turkey for collaboration between environmental NGOs and GoT institutions.
Furthermore, as a result of this collaboration, Turkey's environmental NGOs have begun to think and act
in a new, more focused, and results-oriented way.

A change in protection status for one pilot site may actually lead to less protection for biodiversity,
especially since this is a forest/wetland site impacted by activities beyond its immediate boundaries.
During project implementation, efforts at the I neada site with the GDF focused on better integration of
conservation into forest and wetland management across the whole watershed, with the recognition that
wetland sites are influenced by activities way beyond their boundaries. The designation by GDNCNP in
November, 2007, of only 3,000 ha of this 26,000 ha area as a new national park is widely thought to have
undermined the credibility of the original participatory planning process, as well as plans for managing
this area to maintain its ecological viability. It will be critical that GDNCNP move quickly to allocate
staff and resources to this new national park to rebuild relations with surrounding communities and with
GDF and to revise and implement an appropriate management plan.


3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)
No specific workshops were convened in conjunction with preparation of this Core ICR. During the
course of the project, many stakeholder workshops were supported on a wide range of topics from
discussions on national legislation to zoning of particular conservation areas. The project benefited a wide
range of stakeholders from national and local government staff to academics, NGOs and local
communities.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The project has established a strong foundation for improved biodiversity and protected area
management. Sustainability will depend on institutional ownership and support at the national level and
in relation to progress with approval and implementation of management plans at the four demonstration
sites . While MEF has committed to internalize and mainstream the approaches to protected area
management which this project has piloted, and they are articulated in ministry planning, budgeting and



                                                        10

staffing processes, its long term sustainability and impact of the replication strategy will depend critically
on this type of mainstreaming into the public expenditure program and into institutional processes. This
will require strong leadership at the national and provincial levels to ensure that annual work plans,
budgets and staffing arrangements support implementation of the site management plans. It is
encouraging that provincial directorates and local authorities at two of the visited sites (Sultan Sazli i and
Köprülü Kanyon) stressed their commitment to support implementation of the management plans.
I neada however remains a site of concern, because of its recent change in status and lack of adequate
staffing for its new role as a national park. Overall sustainability is rated as moderately likely.

Ecological sustainability. This project was only the second GEF Biodiversity project in Turkey and the
first executed under both the MoE and MoF (which were later merged to become the Ministry of
Environment and Forests, MEF). The project was executed primarily under the GDNCNP, which has
primary responsibility for nature conservation, but also worked closely and positively with the GDF.
Protected areas cover only some 1.6 % of Turkey's land surface and these areas accommodate other land
uses as well as conservation objectives. The project has been successful in introducing international good
practice and laying the foundation for sound protected area planning and management nationally though
more needs to be done to institutionalize this process. Much of Turkey's rich biodiversity lies outside
protected area boundaries under the State forest estate and the project played a significant role in
introducing biodiversity conservation into forest management planning at a time when State forest policy
was changing to accommodate ecological and social considerations as well as timber production.

Although guidelines and good practices initiated under the project can contribute to ecological
sustainability at individual sites, biodiversity in Turkey still remains under serious threat from policies
and programs implemented under other development sectors, including agriculture, tourism and mining.
In particular water management remains a key concern, which is likely to be exacerbated with climate
change. The Sultan Sazli i PAMA, for instance, has made extraordinary progress in raising local
government support for allocating water flows to the wetland, but these are still inadequate to fully restore
or maintain the wetland because of water demands from agriculture. A minimum water level for the
wetland was set in the 1980s, but is not being enforced. Nevertheless this agreement has been used
successfully by the PAMA to negotiate improved water flows for the wetland. Government and the Bank
have recently agreed to re-engage in discussing Turkey's Water policy framework, and the inclusion of
issues surrounding the environmental dimensions to water use and management would be an important
complement to this discussion. Similarly, there are also important opportunities for addressing other
issues affecting natural resource management in protected areas, particularly with respect to the cadastre.

Social sustainability. A key positive outcome of the project has been the trust that has been built between
the communities, local authorities and PAMAs, demonstrated in a marked improvement in the
relationship between communities and protected area management teams. However, to maintain this
respect and sustain social capital, it is essential that MEF and the provincial directorates take measures to
consolidate progress to date and ensure continued local support. The support through the SGP was always
envisaged as a short term measure but the local capacity which has been developed to prepare and
implement conservation ­orientated micro-projects should be maintained, and efforts have been made to
establish links with other funding mechanisms, including the UNDP-GEF Small Grants Program and the
EU funds managed through UNDP. Specific measures have been taken to explore future options with the
General Directorate of Forest and Village Relations (ORKÖY) and other organizations within MEF to
promote credits for activities which benefit villagers but reduce pressure on natural resources e.g. solar
hot water heating. Experiences from the SGP are of great important to other similar grant-making
exercises, such as the UNDP GEF SGP, and the Regional Environment Center's (REC) Grant Program. A
small booklet about experience with the SGP, and an accompanying film, have been prepared to ensure
that the lessons from the SGP are fully disseminated.




                                                         11

Financial sustainability. One of the original project activities was to devise mechanisms for financial
sustainability of individual protected areas, including retention of revenues from PA visitors and natural
resource use. While some training was offered on financial sustainability, and various studies were
completed about the viability of retaining revenues, earmarking is difficult because of legal and structural
constraints to the collection of such revenues. Protected areas remain heavily dependent on government
budgets. Government is committed to funding protected areas once management plans are approved. It is
encouraging that new management plans include budget and staffing plans and that at least two provincial
directorates have committed to implement management plan activities as part of annual work plans for the
demonstration sites. Like other Parties to the CBD, Turkey is expected to determine and report on the
financial needs for its PA network as a first step in raising the required budgets. Experiences from the
project sites should facilitate this process.

It is important to keep in mind that new investments will be needed to assist Turkey in addressing its EU
accession requirements. The Natura 2000 network, for example, is supposed to go into effect on date of
accession, but it takes many years to set up. No country has ever received an exemption from this
requirement, and at least one (Poland) is being challenged by the EU for not doing a good job with its
Natura 2000 network in the pre-accession stages. It is important to emphasize actually how important the
seeds of this particular project are and can be for EU accession. The management planning process and
the biodiversity database/inventory work introduced through the project are two critical foundations for
Natura 2000, and these will require continued intensive work.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)


5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
There were moderate shortcomings in the identification, preparation and appraisal of the project, and
these were related to the project's ambitious objectives, given the institutional and legal context in Turkey
(underappreciated by the preparation team) and the challenges of introducing new management planning
and practices into a traditionally conservative sector. Project preparation was initially carried out by a
consultant firm, and was financed by a PDF-B grant. The project design outputs from this exercise were
weak and the entire package was redesigned. Subsequent planning efforts were more carefully supervised
by the Bank, but by this time, important opportunities were lost for developing a rigorous and more fully-
owned initiative ­ ownership which only really developed following the MTR. Much of the project's
design was modeled on a similar GEF project which was being prepared at the same time in Romania (the
Romania Biodiversity Conservation Management Project).

The project's design over-estimated management capacity within GDNCNP and GDF, and
underestimated the manageability of many of the critical issues which were affecting selected sites. The
sites were chosen less because they offered the prospect of easy wins (quite important for a project which
was intended to introduce important innovations in protected area management), but more because they
represented some of the toughest challenges in Turkey for tackling multi-sectoral coordination and
community involvement in managing protected areas.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory
Bank staff provided regular and frequent supervision inputs during implementation, if not through the
formal supervision process, through regular visits to Turkey in conjunction with activities related to other
projects. The occasional use of videoconference facilities complemented face-to-face interactions, and
these played an important role especially in the period following September 11, when Bank travel was



                                                      12

constrained. The change of Government which took place around a year before the MTR was an
important watershed, and Supervision sought to focus the new administration's attention on the project's
growing shortcomings and implementation constraints. The decision to downgrade the project at the
Midterm had been anticipated during earlier supervision missions, government had been advised
accordingly, and the Bank provided frequent inputs to help address these shortcomings. The frequency of
Supervision greatly increased after the MTR, to facilitate action in meeting the targets which had been set
for upgrading performance ratings. The outcome was that project performance significantly turned
around.

Supervision of procurement and financial management was originally undertaken in Washington, but
these responsibilities were later decentralized to the Country Office. Performance of CO staff in providing
these services was Satisfactory, though the small size of the operation and its supervision intensity,
compared with the rest of the Bank portfolio in Turkey, posed particular challenges.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Overall Bank performance overall was rated as Moderately Satisfactory because of weaknesses in project
design. Problems with project design and focus were recognized, and at the MTR , the Bank team worked
with government to refocus the project and to identify achievable targets and outcomes. The Task Team
Leader (TTL) established a strong and highly supportive relationship with the PMT which greatly
strengthened project implementation.


5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The project was originally conceived in part as a means to pilot how different agencies within the MoF
could take on the challenge of nature protection, working closely with communities. The two key General
Directorates (GDNCNP and GDF) had different authorizing legislation and institutional cultures, and in
some respects this created a significant institutional divide. Two of the project sites were managed by
GDF as forest reserves, while two were managed as National parks. The sites managed by GDF were
chronically understaffed ­ an issue repeatedly raised during supervision, but never fully solved.
GDNCNP, while it allocated adequate staff to its two sites, only toward the end of the project, began to
institutionally appreciate the challenges and benefits of participatory protected area planning and
management. Rather than finding ways of fully engaging the project team in more general activities of the
Ministry, it remained somewhat isolated and viewed as a `project' rather than as an integral part of what
the Ministry should be trying to accomplish.

MEF's inability fully to mainstream and integrate project-supported activities into the on-going programs
and responsibilities of all MEF units has meant that many of the innovations in protected area planning
and management made by the project have not been fully realized. However, MEF has committed to
internalize and institutionalize the approaches introduced by the project. The project has helped to
establish strong relationships outside government, especially with the NGO community. There is still a
need for better integration and collaboration within MEF itself. In the medium term, however, it is
expected that MEF will build on the project's lessons learned.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Overall project management under the PMT has been very strong, and in some respects could be judged
to be highly satisfactory. At a substantive level, the coordinator and her team have worked extremely hard
to make the project's interventions relevant and timely, recognizing the need to bring Turkey's protected
area management standards up to international standards. The PMT has established excellent relationships



                                                       13

with the broader community of conservation practitioners, including NGOs and academicians, and
worked consistently to develop and disseminate good practice materials.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Although project and MEF staff at the site level worked extremely hard, their efforts were somewhat
undermined by the inability of senior staff within MEF to address PA staffing issues, legal and regulatory
matters, and approval of management plans in a timely manner. Outside of the project and replication
areas, the project so far seems not to have fully succeeded in changing MEF's approach to managing
protected areas. After eight years of project assistance, the PAMA model of site-specific, dedicated teams
for protected area management has not really been institutionalized. MEF's biggest remaining challenge
over the coming months will be to institutionalize some of the project's lessons, to ensure that outcome
are sustainable.


6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)
Some key lessons learned from the project include:

·   Project design, objectives and indicators need to be realistic, especially where the project aims to
    introduce new management practices requiring considerable change in institutional and legal
    frameworks. Some of the expected project outcomes were beyond the ultimate control of the MEF
    alone e.g. approval of new legislation, and this impacted on other project outputs and full
    achievement of the project development objectives.

·   Effecting change requires a substantial time frame and "buy-in" from different levels of society from
    PAMAs and local communities to decision-makers. The project provided support for only a specified
    time line to initiate a much longer-term process. Success and sustainability will depend on how well
    these changed practices are adopted beyond the PMT and project sites and internalized and
    institutionalized within normal ministry practice. Ideally such institutionalization should begin well
    before the close of the project.

·   Enhanced capacity was a key outcome of the project, both at the PAMA level and broader
    conservation community, including NGOs. However, limitations of staffing at the PAMA level and
    the use of short-term consultants for some key tasks limited the extent to which capacity was fully
    mainstreamed within the GDNCNP.

·   While conservation targets and management objectives and priorities are based on biological
    parameters, implementing successful planning and management depends on social and economic
    factors. The Small Grants Program played a very useful role in building good will and partnerships
    with local communities and helped to build trust and cooperation at the local level. Targeted outreach
    activities, the national conference and other collaboration with NGOs at both site and national level
    also helped to strengthen and improve partnerships between government and civil society to further
    the conservation agenda.

·   In terms of the Turkey portfolio, this was a small project. As a result, while the PMT was highly
    effective, it was somewhat marginalized within the ministry. Other Bank projects have benefited from
    higher-levels of coordination, and by Ministry management which is able to make key decisions and
    to mainstream project activities better. Projects also need to be of a significant enough size relative to
    the country and its other ongoing activities to have the visibility needed to serve as a country model
    for future investments.




                                                      14

·    The project laid a solid foundation for new PA management practices consistent with international
     good practice and EU guidelines. It will be important that future Bank, GEF and other donor projects
     related to PAs and NRM use and build on these good practices.

·    Many of the issues which threaten biodiversity at the project sites and elsewhere in Turkey are related
     to sectoral policies and programs, which are beyond the influence of a particular general directorate
     or ministry e.g. water management. The Bank could play a much stronger role in integrating GEF-
     supported biodiversity conservation priorities into its larger portfolio and its dialogue with
     government. Turkey's Water policy framework and other sectoral challenges, such as the cadastre,
     have profound impacts on nature protection, and the sectoral dialogue needs to be broadened to
     account for these impacts.

·    The National Meeting on Biodiversity and Protected Area Management held in May 2006 provided
     an excellent mechanism for engaging stakeholders, establishing a learning network, and
     disseminating good practice. Partnerships and collaboration established through the conference have
     been sustained to support conservation activities at new sites. Convening such a conference could be
     a useful outreach and dissemination mechanism for other projects.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies. A comprehensive completion report, several hundreds of pages in
length, was prepared by the PIU. The Executive Summary is included in Annex 6.

In its review of the draft ICR, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry provided the following written
assurances:

         "... Ministry efforts to carry out some of the project activities which could not be achieved during
         the project period will continue. These activities include:

         a)       Approval of management plans for Köprülü kanyon and I neada Longoz Forest National
                  Park;

         b)       Assessment and approval of the management plan of Camili Biosphere Reserve by the
                  Ministry

         In addition to these, since the draft Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Law is a comprehensive
         legislation, after receiving the opinions of the related institutions, it will be presented to the
         Turkish Grand National Assembly for approval...."

                                      Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The project showed mixed progress on project components, with considerable progress on some aspects
and less satisfactory performance, outputs, and outcomes for others.

Component 1: Strengthening the National Framework for Biodiversity Conservation (US$ 3.29
million):

(i)     Participatory review and development of a strategy for rationalizing the legal framework for
        biodiversity conservation, including removal of overlapping sectoral legislation and policy, and
        adjustment of other legislation impacting on biodiversity. The project prepared and executed a
        highly participatory strategy for rationalizing the legal framework for biodiversity conservation,
        which resulted in a new draft nature and biodiversity conservation law meeting international
        standards and benefiting from the full consultation of relevant stakeholders (institutional,
        academic, and civil society). The draft law is undergoing review at the highest levels in the MEF
        and has been informally shared with the Turkish Parliament. Enactment of the new legislation is
        anticipated in the near future (with support from Turkey's drive for EU accession), once the
        remaining sectoral issues (mining, tourism, etc.) have been resolved and implementation
        regulations have been drafted. It is still uncertain what exemptions may be requested and whether
        such exemptions would weaken the new law. Although adoption of the new law was listed as a
        project indicator, in reality it should be considered beyond the reasonable expectation of project
        outputs. (Moderately Satisfactory).

(ii)    Strengthening the institutional capacity to develop a national network of protected areas and
        replicate the experience of effective participatory protected area management systems developed
        at the four project sites. This will include assessing and developing sustainable financing
        mechanisms to support conservation initiatives. Capacity building was a major part of the project.
        In terms of capacity building, the project provided relevant training (courses, domestic and
        foreign study tours) to a large number of project personnel, ministry staff, and national and local
        stakeholders (767 people attended in-country training activities, 182 participants in study tours
        held abroad), with an emphasis on PAMA officials at project sites. The project initiated
        identification of nine potential sites for replication of effective management systems in 2004
        through a structured assessment and evaluation process and began actual replication support
        activities (action plans, conservation targets, stakeholder and threat analyses, training and
        awareness rising) in 2005 - 2007. The nine replication sites actively engaged relevant
        stakeholders (local officials, national and local NGOs, villagers) in these activities and submitted
        project proposals for funding to the EU and other international organizations. MEF has
        incorporated many of the activities from the action plans at these sites into its 2008 work program
        and has undertaken a much needed revision of the technical order on preparation of protected area
        management plans. The project also prepared a "Management Planning Guide" to facilitate
        planning activities in protected areas, produced and distributed a publication on "Best Practices in
        Protected Areas in Turkey", and held Turkey's first National Conference on Biodiversity and
        Protected Area Management in 2006. To capitalize on its successes, the project published
        "Planning and Management of Protected Areas: The BNRMP Experience", which should serve as
        an important tool in the replication of the works started by the project. Strengthened capacity has
        been a major outcome of the project (Highly Satisfactory).

(iii)   Establishing a system to monitor the status of biodiversity and conservation initiatives throughout
        the country. The project facilitated the establishment of a Biodiversity Monitoring Unit (BMU)
        within the MEF, which performed a gap analysis nationwide, digitally mapped protected areas
        and compiled field data on critical biodiversity, and then developed a Biodiversity Information



                                                       17

     Management System (BIMS, locally called `Noah's Ark'), with internet-based data compilation
     and management, for monitoring biodiversity on the basis of species, habitats, protected areas and
     threats. The BMU also established a multi-disciplinary technical team for biodiversity monitoring
     and provided training to PAMA staff at the project protected area sites. While the database is
     populated with species data, it is still unclear how the BIMS is being used to monitor biodiversity
     at individual sites. Discussions are still underway on the institutional home for the BMU, whether
     within GDF or as an independent scientific institute. Adequate staffing and resources to maintain
     and opertionalise the database as well as for PA monitoring will be crucial for sustainability
     (Moderately Satisfactory).

(iv) Developing and implementing a prioritized national strategy and targeted action plan for raising
     the awareness of key stakeholders and the general public about the importance, urgent needs and
     opportunities for biodiversity conservation in Turkey. The project facilitated preparation of two
     national awareness strategies: (i) a National Biodiversity Awareness Strategy and Action Plan,
     completed in 2004, for public awareness on biodiversity (PASAP); and a Strategy and Action
     Plan for Capacity Building of Non-Governmental Organizations Related to Biodiversity
     (NGOSAP), completed in 2003. The NGOSAP was prepared with the participation of 19 NGOs
     (11 national, 8 local), with the aim of increasing the capacities of local, regional and national
     environmental NGOs on biodiversity conservation and creating an NGO platform for providing a
     stronger NGO voice on nature conservation in the country. At the local level, the project
     developed and distributed materials for general public awareness (brochures, posters, logos, etc.)
     at each project site based on the stakeholder analyses performed. The project also prepared
     educational materials for primary school students and an Environmental Education Resource
     Booklet for use by teachers in the schools, NGOs, volunteers. Nature conservation has
     successfully been incorporated into the national curriculum. While the NGO and educational
     components were highly satisfactory less progress has been made with implementation of the
     national awareness strategy, which required considerable buy-in and resources from non-project
     sources. (Moderately Satisfactory).

(v)  Demonstrating how biodiversity issues can be incorporated in the forest management planning
     process at three of the four project sites. The project established a Biodiversity Integration
     Committee (BIC) to undertake integration of biodiversity conservation into the forest
     management plans at three project sites (I neada, Camili, and Köprülü Kanyon). Through a
     highly participatory process involving relevant stakeholders at the sites, the project prepared new
     forest management plans for two of the sites (I neada and Camili), incorporating biodiversity
     considerations based on biodiversity inventories/assessments performed at the sites and protective
     zoning of conservation targets agreed with stakeholders. The same process was initiated for
     Köprülü Kanyon, where the forest management plan was also completed. These pilot initiatives
     were timely as they coincided with changes in forest management policy nation-wide. These
     experiences facilitated incorporation of biodiversity conservation into the revised forest
     management regulation, which was promulgated in February 2008, and the relevant technical
     order, which was prepared and will be promulgated in 2008. (Satisfactory)



Component 2 Establish systems for participatory planning and management of four protected areas

(i)  Building Protected Area Management Authority (PAMA) staff skills, developing protected area
     management planning systems, including exploring mechanisms for generating and retaining
     revenues at the sites, and providing equipment and facilities, including visitor interpretation,
     educational and/or community centers. Extensive capacity building efforts were the focus of early
     efforts of a firm which was hired to provide technical assistance and training in preparing
     protected area management plans. It is not clear that the skills deployed by the firm were



                                                   18

     immediately relevant to the Turkish context, and it took a great deal of effort to reorient the firm
     to provide skills and services of greater relevance. Particular mention should be made of two of
     the staff employed by the firm, who worked closely together toward the end of the firm's contract
     in developing the capacity for participatory management plan preparation and in developing
     negotiating skills, so that communities could be more effectively engaged in resolving conflicts
     over natural resource use within protected area boundaries. The firm also engaged a specialist to
     provide advice and assistance about sustainable financing of protected areas and Turkey. The
     subject of fee collection was only seriously considered in Köprülü kanyon, but this focus diverted
     attention from other more pressing conservation issues and opportunities, and so the idea of
     exploring this possibility further was dropped. Other sites were simply not suitable for regulatory
     reasons, or because of their physical configuration, for fee collection.

     Early during project implementation, a series of study tours and trainings were mounted with
     project support. The Bank raised various concerns about their relevance, and insisted on much
     closer oversight and supervision of these activities, which were subsequently considerably scaled
     back. In the final two years of the project, it was agreed that targeted and strategic support could
     still be made of remaining travel funds, and these proved to be extremely useful in exposing
     Ministry staff to conservation practices in other parts of Europe.

     The project financed extensive purchases of goods and equipment for use by the Ministry and in
     project field sites. Most evidence suggests these were effectively used, though (as noted
     elsewhere) various concerns were raised by the Bank about the allocation of project-financed
     vehicles. With respect to visitor infrastructure in the pilot sites, civil works have been completed
      in I neada, Camili and Sultan Sazli i. The I neada Visitors Center (at the time of the ICR
     mission) while of good design and construction, was not staffed and so had been locked and was
     vacant. Planned civil works in Köprülü kanyon were dropped following the MTR because of a
     view that there were other priorities which should be addressed first, including developing better
     relations with communities and villages within the National park. Although the project has
     supported investment in infrastructure (including visitor centers noted above), it is not clear that
     the GDNCNP has adequate plans for staffing these centers. All three sites visited still lack any
     clear signage to identify the extent of protected areas and/or sites of significant interest and
     activities allowed under the different management regimes.

(ii)  Preparing protected area management plans in a participatory manner and guided by baseline
     ecological and socio-economic surveys and biodiversity monitoring systems. Management plans
      have been prepared in a participatory manner at the four project sites with strong local
      consultation on land use and zoning of the protected areas. Unfortunately to-date, only one
      management plan (Sultan Sazli i) has been approved after modification to present it as the Long-
      term Development Plan required under current legislation. Now that the Sultan Sazli i plan has
      been approved it is expected that the process for Köprülü Kanyon will be completed in the near
      future so that implementation can begin. Management plans have also been prepared for Camili
      and I neada but approval is more complicated since both of these areas fall under the jurisdiction
      of two General Directorates, GDNCNP and GDF. Camili was declared Turkey's first UNESCO
      Biosphere Reserve as a result of project efforts. The I neada plan focused on improving
      conservation planning for 26000 hectares of forests, including a small strict nature protection area
      (1500ha). The declaration of 3000 hectares of wetlands and Longos forests within this site as a
      national park in November, 2007 further complicates the issue since the management plan will
      have to be revised just for the small national park area. Nevertheless, management of the
      surrounding forests and watershed will be critical to the health of the I neada wetlands.

      Project staff identified specific subsectoral activities which required clearer strategies for
      management. In Sultan Sazli i, for instance, efforts were put into preparing a `Reed Management



                                                    19

        Plan' which helped identify how the marsh reed beds (which are highly lucrative for the
        production and export of thatch) could best be managed with community involvement. The reed
        management plan became an important local instrument for resolving conflicts over resource use,
        and its implementation helped reduce the frequency of fires which damaged the reed beds (and
        bird nesting sites) ­ the clearest symptom of community conflict over rights of use and access.
        Most sites prepared `grazing management plans' to help tackle problems of livestock. This mini-
        plans were eventually incorporated into the overall management plan, and were important
        building blocks. In Köprülü kanyon, the project supported the development of a cultural assets
        management plan (as part of the overall management plan), to ensure that activities associated
        with ancient cultural sites within the national park were fully aligned with the overall park
        management plan.

(iii)   Building local support for biodiversity conservation through a public awareness and education
        program targeted at key stakeholder groups. The project supported extensive public awareness
        activities at the local level, including workshops, structured consultations, and regular interactions
        with villagers. Most project sites developed outreach programs with local schools, and facilitated
        field visits for children and villagers to other natural sites in Turkey. This was one of the project's
        unheralded successes. Project staff also found good opportunities to leverage support for nature
        conservation activities by working with local institutions.

(iv)    Facilitating establishment of community based mechanisms, such as small grant schemes or
        revolving funds, to support conservation-linked development and reduce unsustainable use of
        shared resources such as forest and wetland products and grazing. The site PAMAs have put
        enormous effort into the process of building up good relationships with local stakeholders
        (including local mayors). These relationships and support have been important in addressing key
        issues, for example water management at Sultan Sazli i.

        The Small Grants Program (SGP) was designed as an outreach tool and has been critical at all
        sites in building good will and helping to dispel distrust between local villagers and park
        management. They have also proved useful for engaging different stakeholders, including local
        communities and government authorities, in park planning issues and addressing sectoral
        challenges. The PAMAs have made strong efforts to link small grant support to conservation
        needs, for example introducing alternative agricultural practices that reduce grazing, timber
        harvesting and water use threats to the protected areas. Progress with the SGP has been important
        both in terms of leveraging local support for protected area management, and also for building the
        credibility of PAMAs in their ability to deliver resources with 150 small grants supported (see the
        table) Nevertheless, while small grants have benefited a key beneficiaries and piloted some
        interesting initiatives they are insufficient for reducing widespread pressures on the PAs (and
        perhaps were never intended to bring this about) and at times conservation linkages are indirect or
        not clear. Longer-term benefits are more likely to accrue from major changes in sectoral policies
        in forestry and development projects, for example programs to change agricultural practices and
        reduce water use around key wetlands such as Sultan Sazli i.

(v)      Guiding the development of environmentally responsible tourism to emphasize linkages between
         conservation and benefits for local stakeholders. As part of management plan preparation, each
         site also prepared `ecotourism plans,' and these were eventually incorporated into the overall
         management plans. Staff at I neada invited a tour operator to assemble a group of `ecotourists' to
         test out the market for particular environmental services at the park site. This was an extremely
         useful and innovative means of identifying ecotourism opportunities. Activities in Camili were
         coordinated with a national NGO, which began supporting local tours, and the project provided
         training in ecotourism development for local and national staff.

(vi)     Establishing collaborative mechanisms to ensure biodiversity conservation is incorporated into
         local sectoral and land use plans. Although the project has supported a very thorough planning
         process, to date there is only limited implementation on the ground. Nevertheless, PA
         management effectiveness has improved as measured by the PA METT (Annex 7). As part of the
         management planning process, PAMAs documented land ownership and worked with
         communities on land use and zoning issues. At Köprülü Kanyon, the PAMA assisted the
         community to legalize some settlement areas in the cultural zones so that housing could be
         upgraded. Nevertheless, at several sites issues of land tenure remain and it has been impossible
         for the PAMAs to address illegal construction and development (for instance 90 buildings
         associated with tourism at Köprülü Kanyon); indeed it was not reasonable to expect such issues to
         be fully resolved under the project. Similarly, plans to address financial sustainability have not
         been implemented.

         Both Köprülü Kanyon and Sultan Sazli i have made significant progress since the MTR and
         outreach activities have been highly successful in engaging local communities and local mayors.
         Nevertheless, key challenges remain at these sites, related to water management and tourism
         development. Dealing with such major challenges and powerful sectors requires high-level
         political support and involvement of higher levels of institutional support than the PAMAs alone
         to ensure incorporation of PA concerns into regional planning and development. While the
         PAMAs have been successful in establishing partnerships with other local actors this
         collaboration is dependent on strong personal relationships which could be threatened if key staff
         are re-assigned or players change as a result of local elections. At I neada, the lack of any staff
         assigned full-time to the new national park threatens to undermine participatory planning efforts.
         Although the capacity of the PAMA staff is impressive and PAMA members have clearly
         benefited from training and study tours under the project, under-staffing remains a concern at all
         sites and has been flagged at all supervisions. At all sites, PAMA staff have responsibilities for
         other PAs as well as the designated demonstration sites. Effective implementation of management
         plans, once they are approved, will require prompt allocation of more full-time staff to all sites.




                                                      21

While the PAMAs have worked diligently to organize a participatory planning approach the delays in
approval and implementation of the management plans are a matter of concern. All of the necessary
groundwork is in place but success of this component will be dependent on effective follow-up, additional
staffing and implementation of key actions under provincial work plans over the next few months. Delays
in approval of the necessary plans and regulations at the central level have seriously jeopardized the
success of this component. Overall, this component has therefore been rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

Component 3: Project Management and Monitoring

Overall project management under the Project Management Team (PMT) has been very strong, and in
some respects could be judged to be highly satisfactory. At a substantive level, the coordinator and her
team have worked extremely hard to make the project's interventions relevant and timely, responding to
the challenge of introducing innovation into an area which is traditionally conservative. The PMT has
established excellent relationships with the broader community of conservation practitioners, including
NGOs and academicians, and worked consistently to develop and disseminate good practice materials.

Very good progress has been noted since the MTR when the project was rated unsatisfactory. Both the
PMT and the GDNCNP responded positively to the MTR findings and re-orientated the project to more
focused and achievable targets and activities at national and site levels. In particular, the PMT has played
a key role in raising the profile of conservation and participatory protected area management through
organization of the National Protected Area Conference and fostering opportunities for replication at the
nine replication sites.

Although the PMT staff have worked effectively and pragmatically to further project objectives, in many
ways the good practices arising from the project have not been fully internalized and institutionalized
within the different directorates of MEF, especially within the various divisions of the GDNCNP. There is
still much to be done to ensure that the lessons and new practices are fully integrated into regular
protected area planning and management. Strong leadership and political commitment will be essential to
build on progress to date to benefit the whole protected area network and to promote stronger national
support for biodiversity conservation as part of the sustainable development agenda. Buy-in and
ownership from GDNCNP is critical for sustainability. While this component is rated Satisfactory overall,
concerns remain about weak internalization of project outcomes within the GDNCNP.

                               Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The project was a stand-alone GEF project with a GEF grant and counterpart funding from Government
of Turkey. At the time the project was designed neither financial nor economic analyses were required, so
standard assessments of cost effectiveness or efficiency were not calculated, and would be extremely
difficult to assess ex-post. Having said this, this was a very small operation by Bank standards. Although
it was management intensive because of the nature of the investment, it was in many respects a very low-
cost high-impact GEF project.

                          Annex 5. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

No official workshops were held with other stakeholders as part of the Implementation Completion
review. Nevertheless, the ICR mission met with a broad range of stakeholders, both at site level and
centrally in Ankara, including national and local NGOs, local government officials and recipients of small
grants under the program.

There was a general consensus that the project had proved important in building bridges between
government and civil society and had established a good partnership for conservation between
government, NGOs, academics and the private sector. The NGOs recognized the project's contribution in
promoting participation and integrating social issues into protected area management. NGOs recognized
with appreciation the processes associated with revising the legal framework, collating data and
establishing the biodiversity monitoring unit as well as the usefulness of the National Protected Area
workshops and networks for dissemination of information and good practice. The PMT and MEF built on
this goodwill to expand the scope of the project and actively promote replication of good practice at an
additional nine sites during the course of the project. Stakeholders from the additional protected area sites
were highly appreciative of this opportunity to engage.

Due to its highly strategic biogeographical position, Turkey is host to an abundance of biodiversity,
including 9000 plant species (of which nearly 3000 are endemic), 400 species of birds, 400 fish species
and 120 mammals. The protected areas in Turkey designated and managed to conserve biodiversity
(according to the National Parks Law), cover a mere one percent of the national territory. Moreover, there
were a number of constraints and weaknesses within the national protected area system, including the lack
of clarity in legally defining protected area categories; the small size of the national parks themselves; a
lack of scientific information and analysis to identify conservation priorities and inform protected area
management; insufficient funds for protected areas; weak capacity and the lack of personnel training
programs; as well as limited public awareness and lack of public education programs on biodiversity
conservation.

Accordingly, the Turkish authorities took measures to develop environmental assessment procedures,
draft a new environmental law, and prepare a national biodiversity strategy and action plan with the
support of relevant stakeholders. A second GEF biodiversity project, Biodiversity and Natural
Resources Management Project (BNRMP), was prepared to target four demonstration sites which
represented a range of biogeographic regions and threats, with supporting activities designed at the
national level. A project management team was established within the Ministry of Environment and
Forests (MEF) as well as four project units with the aim of developing prototypes for effective protected
area management. These were the Biodiversity Integration Committee, the Legal Unit for Rationalization
of the Legal Framework, the Biodiversity Monitoring Committee and the Public Awareness Unit. The
work of these four units is explained below.

The Biodiversity Integration Committee was set up in order to demonstrate how biodiversity issues can
be incorporated into forest management plans. As a result, biodiversity-integrated forest management
plans, the first of their kind, were prepared for the I neada and Bulanikdere forest management districts.
These new plans incorporated data from flora and fauna inventories and identified conservation targets
and related management objectives. Using the same approach, the forest management plan for the Camili
project site was also prepared. A forest management plan for Köprülü Kanyon using similar principles has
also been completed. The Biodiversity Integration Committee also reviewed the existing forest
management regulation and prepared a new biodiversity-integrated forest management regulation with
broad stakeholder participation.

The aim of the Legal Unit was to establish the legal basis for the sustainability of the nature conservation
works initiated during the project; to carry out a participatory analysis of the key issues related to the
current legal framework for nature and biodiversity conservation in Turkey; to develop a strategy for
addressing these issues; and to make necessary legislative changes in accordance with the strategy
identified. The final strategy ("Developing a New Law on Nature Protection and Sustainable Use of
Biodiversity"), which was released to the public through a press conference in June 2003, presents a
comprehensive plan for drafting and adopting the new law on biodiversity and nature protection. Aiming
at adoption of the new law by 2005 in order to facilitate the EU accession, the strategy represents an
incredible legislative/political challenge. Unlike other Turkish legislation, this draft law is the first to be
prepared through a highly participatory process (approximately 1500 people were involved in the process
and their opinions have been taken into consideration). Furthermore, this draft law harmonized the
existing legal frameworks and regulations for nature protection and biodiversity, which were inadequate
and inconsistent, into one comprehensive act. Unfortunately, a slowdown in the EU accession process



                                                       29

from the second half of 2005, and weakening political support have slowed down the review and adoption
of the new legislation. Therefore, there is now an urgent need for active lobbying to pursue the
parliamentary legislative process and to explain to parliamentarians in clear terms that the draft reflects an
approach that allows for rational use and protection of national resources.

The Biodiversity Monitoring Unit (BMU) was established in order to identify important natural areas
which were not represented in the existing protected area system and to monitor the status of biodiversity
and species under conservation nationwide. The BMU, which operates within the General Directorate of
Forestry, has performed two main tasks: (i) conducting a gap analysis of biodiversity conservation
nationwide to identify priority areas for conservation action; and (ii) developing a biodiversity database
called "Noah's Ark". In addition, many training activities and technical visits abroad were held as a part
of the capacity building program. At this point, the BMU has developed the scientific and technical
infrastructure for analysis of biodiversity on the basis of species, habitats and protected areas. In addition,
the BMU has set up a technical team comprising various disciplines with regard to biodiversity
monitoring. Furthermore, the BMU has succeeded in including text on biodiversity monitoring and the
institutionalization of the BMU within the draft law on the conservation of nature and biodiversity. In
spite of these positive developments, however, the lack of trained personnel for the gap analysis,
especially at the beginning, caused delays. Furthermore, the reluctance of some university scientists to
provide biological data caused problems with populating the biodiversity database. It remains of great
importance that the Marmara gap analysis be continued and that new regions for gap analysis, if any, be
identified. Finally, the "scientific consultative council" together with the "board of experts" on the
database should be established.

The Public Awareness Unit was established in 2000 with the aim of developing:

    (a) a National Biodiversity Awareness Strategy and Action Plan for public awareness on biodiversity
         (PASAP); and
    (b) a Strategy and Action Plan for Capacity Building of Non-Governmental Organizations Related to
         Biodiversity (NGOSAP).

Both of these strategies were prepared through a participatory process and during each phase of the
process the opinions and recommendations of the relevant stakeholders were solicited. For the PASAP
four different focal groups, namely media, education, government institutions and the business sector,
were established to ensure participation and representation of stakeholders from different sectors. Under
the PASAP, a series of public awareness activities were carried out in collaboration with two business
enterprises for the protection of natural resources in project implementation areas. With regard to the
NGOSAP, the project hired a consultant and held several workshops with broad participation of NGOs,
after which process the strategy and action plan developed were discussed with the representatives of 11
national and 8 local NGOs. The Public Awareness Unit also created educational materials for primary
school students, as identified in the PASAP. The Unit also reached agreement to work with the NGOs in
defining common benefits with the government institutions. Unfortunately lack of clarity on the roles and
responsibilities for the relevant parties, and the decision taken by the consultants to unite the two
strategies under a common protocol, resulted in delays. In the end, the groups dismantled. In terms of next
steps, more effort needs to be focused on strengthening cooperation between the government agencies and
NGOs for specific conservation activities, as identified in the strategies. Capacity building focused on
public relations should be a high priority for the Training Division of the General Directorate in executing
the public awareness program.

The activities and implementation at the national level were complemented by activities on the ground at
the four pilot sites. Protected Area Management Authorities (PAMAs) were only established after the
fifth month of the project, since no personnel could be found to work full time in the field. As a result,
project activities were implemented only by the PAMA managers assigned. Throughout the project



                                                       30

implementation period, the number of PAMA personnel varied both within each PAMA and among
different PAMAs, primarily based on the personnel policies of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry.
Lack of site-level personnel has remained a constraint during the project. During the first year of the
project and also throughout the whole project period, PAMA personnel attended several training and
capacity building activities, such as study tours abroad and foreign language courses.

A key sub-component under "Strengthening the National Framework for Biodiversity Conservation" was
"to develop a national network of protected areas and replicate the experience of effective participatory
protected area management systems developed at the four project sites." Nine replication areas, across the
country, were selected through a participatory process based on conservation values and needs. The
replication areas of the BNRMP are as follows: Akg¢l Nature Protection Area, Sarûkum Nature Protection
Area, Yazûlû Canyon Nature Park, Lake Kovada National Park, Amanos Mountains, K§re Mountains
National Park, Karagöl National Park, Acarlar Longos and Tuzla Lake. Participatory planning and
activities have started in all replication sites. The replication program has started a movement in which
stakeholder groups are involved in the protection of biodiversity and in the sustainable use of natural
resources in the local environment.

The Financial Management Unit (FMU) was established within the Project Management Team (PMT)
in 2000 with the appointment of government staff as Financial Management Officer, Disbursement
Specialist and Financial Management Specialist. The PMT has been subject to regular audits by the
Treasury and the World Bank during the project period. The financial reports and documents have been
audited by Treasury within the following six months after every fiscal year and reported to the World
Bank. The Bank has also made annual visits for inspection purposes. In addition when deemed necessary
internal auditors within the Ministry have performed audits.

The Procurement Unit (PU) was established within the PMT in 2000 with the appointment of
government staff as Procurement officer and Procurement Specialist. The PU has ensured that all
procurement activities developed in the pilot project sites and central unit are undertaken in accordance
with the Procurement Plan and World Bank Procurement Guidelines. The PU has developed many
international competitive bidding (ICB), international (IS) and national shopping (NS), quality and cost
based selection (QCBS), consultant's qualification (CQ), individual selection (IND), single source
selection (SS) according to the World Bank Procurement Procedures.

The purchase of materials, goods and equipment needed for launching implementation of the project was
mostly realized during the first year of the project. The PAMAs and the Replication Sites have developed
many national shopping (NS) international shopping (IS), minor works (MW), national competitive
bidding (NCB) and individual consultant selections (IND) according to their local procurement plans
through providing no-objection from the PMT. By the end of the project, all PAMAs will have fully
realized their planned expenditures in the local procurement plans.

2) Assessment of the outcome against agreed objectives

The project had three components: (i) strengthening the national framework for biodiversity conservation;
(ii) developing prototypes for effective protected area management; and (iii) project management and
monitoring. The summary of the activities and outcomes from the components follows:

Component 1: Strengthening the National Framework for Biodiversity Conservation

(i)      Legislation. The process of identifying the key legal issues was driven by technical working
         groups composed of Turkish experts on nature protection and biodiversity from relevant
         governmental agencies, NGOs, academic institutions, and PAMAs. The project was successful in
         developing a new strategy, "To Develop a New Law on Nature Protection and Sustainable Use of



                                                        31

      Biodiversity", which presents a comprehensive plan for drafting and adopting the new law on
      biodiversity and nature protection. The highly participatory process was highly effective in
      engaging a broad range of stakeholders and effective and efficient in formulating applicable
      provisions. The draft law was presented for review to government in 2005 but is still awaiting
      passage through parliament.

(ii)  Replication The BNRMP established a committee, with broad participation of representatives of
      various governmental bodies and NGOs, to determine at least one replication site for each project
      demonstration site. The committee selected the potential replication sites based on technical
      studies conducted. At first, four sites were selected as replication sites, one for each project
      demonstration site, but the number of replication sites eventually increased to nine. At each
      replication site, the staff executed a number of activities in the area in accordance with the work
      plans prepared. The expansion of improved management practices and other international good
      practice to the replication sites has been a key achievement and outcome of the project.

      Turkey held its first national conference on Biodiversity and Protected Area Management in
      Ankara from May 22 to 24, 2006. The conference attracted a great deal of interest and
      participation from the conservation community in Turkey and provided the expected opportunity
      for exchanging information and experience. Lessons learnt at the four project implementation
      areas were compiled and published as a guide book. The project prepared a set of criteria for the
      selection of best practices in management and planning of the protected areas, which resulted in a
      publication on national best practices. Studies for the revision of the Technical Order regulating
      the preparation of the management plans has been started in line with the experiences gained
      during the BNRMP management planning studies.

(iii) Monitoring. To identify the non-represented natural areas in the national protected area network
      and monitor the status of biodiversity conservation, the Biodiversity Monitoring Unit undertook:
      (a) a gap Analysis for the Coastal Aegean Region, which has been completed, and for the
      Marmara Region, for which field studies for the provinces of Balûkesir, ,,anakkale, zmit and
      Adapazarû have been completed and established; (b) a Noah's Ark Database, which has been
      opened to the public for monitoring biodiversity on the basis of species, habitats, protected areas
      and threats.

(iv)  Public Awareness. A consultancy firm prepared a National Biodiversity Awareness Strategy and
      Action Plan (BSAP) for raising public awareness on biodiversity. An individual consultant
      prepared a Strategy and Action Plan for Capacity Building of Non-Governmental Organizations
      Related to Biodiversity (NGOSAP) with broad participation. In accordance with these strategies,
      a number of activities have been undertaken at the national level. At the local level, public
      awareness activities were executed by a consulting firm in the first years of the project. A list of
      training material needs for general public awareness in the areas was prepared and the Imam
      training program was developed. After the consulting firm completed its task, the PAMAs
      executed the public awareness activities on their own on the basis of the work plans prepared.

v)    Forest Management Plans Biodiversity-integrated forest management plans have been prepared
      for two project sites,   neada and Camili. Preparation of new forest management plans financed
      by the Government budget, has been completed for K¢pr§l§ Kanyon and Yukarû G¢kdere (a
      replication site). A new forest management regulation integrating biodiversity conservation has
      been prepared, submitted to the Ministry, and approved. A technical order for implementation of
      this new regulation has also been prepared.

Component 2: Developing Prototypes for Effective Protected Area Management




                                                    32

At the four project demonstration sites, PAMA teams comprising at least three full-time people have been
formed and protected area offices have been established. The project offered extensive training programs
to the PAMA staff on various subjects, such as awareness raising, biodiversity and nature conservation,
protected area management, sustainable development, etc. These training programs made an important
contribution to the teams' overall capabilities and efficiencies. As a result of their expertise, these core
teams are now leading implementation of planning and management activities more widely in at least
three different bio-geographic regions of the country.

Management plans have been completed for four project sites and already approved for one, Sultan
Sazli i. Biodiversity and socio-economic data were collected and reflected in the management plans,
which include a monitoring plan identifying what will be monitored, by whom, when and with what
resources. The sites are already using the "Tracking Tool for Management Effectiveness for Protected
Areas" which was translated into Turkish and used at both the project sites and replication sites.

The participatory process for preparation of the protected area management plans have resulted in
improved relations between PAMA staff and local communities and local governments. PAMAs have
taken steps to establish various consultative platforms on key issues (especially in Köprülü Kanyon,
Sultan Sazlû û and     neada for the water problems) and to support local NGOs and communities to
promote conservation of the natural attributes of the area. In addition, the small grant projects
implemented at project sites have increased both the capacity and the income of the local people.

All the PAMAs have succeeded in organizing workshops to prepare their annual work plans, through
which they could share experiences and find solutions to common problems, thus avoiding so some
delays. Having PAMA personnel trained on subjects such as GIS, awareness raising, sustainable
development, monitoring, participatory rural appraisal, facilitation, English language and etc., made a
contribution to the team's overall capabilities and efficiencies in nature conservation. However, despite
these positive developments, in the first 2.5 years of the project, the desired performance could not be
attained due to an inability to implement a good managerial strategy towards the project sites. Limited
communication of the PAMAs with the local stakeholders also led to unsatisfactory performance during
the first years of the project.

The Small Grants Program (SGP) was implemented in order to reduce, eliminate and combat priority
threats affecting the biodiversity in the project areas and to provide alternative income resources to local
communities. The SGP was effective in facilitating participation of local communities in project
implementation and in encouraging them to come up with project proposals designed to promote
conservation as well as benefit villages and livelihoods. The project supported numerous initiatives from
ecotourism homestays to improved livestock management to encourage more sustainable management of
natural resources within the protected areas. It is too early to make a sound assessment of the effects and
sustainability of the small grants projects completed in December 2007. However, the completion ratios
of the projects and outputs in the implementation process appear quite positive. Impact assessment studies
on the SGP should be conducted in the coming years.

Project Component 3: Project Management and Monitoring

The Project Management Team (PMT) oversaw and supported implementation of all project activities in
accordance with agreed monitorable indicators. It worked closely with PAMA staff at the four sites and
with the agencies responsible for implementing project activities at the national level and developed and
monitored work plans for all project activities on a biannual basis. In addition, the PMT established a
financial management system to keep the accounting records and produce the necessary financial reports.
Since 2003, local procurement plans have been prepared for demonstration and replication sites by the
PMT and site staff under the General Procurement Plan of the project. The PMT was also responsible for
procurement of services, goods and works under the project. Finally, the PMT provided technical



                                                      33

assistance to the PAMAs in developing materials and organizing special events to promote the resource
values of the sites.

Capacity building and outreach were key features of the project. Within the project period, 746 trainings
were given in Turkey, 185 trainings were given abroad, to a total of 2116 people trained. Also, for
different reasons, a total of 89 fundamental meetings were organized. For publicity of the project and
biodiversity conservation 40 different types of posters were produced with a total number of 30.000. Also
six different types of brochures were prepared (10.000 published), 18 different types of books were also
prepared (21.000 published), all in the Turkish language, and distributed to the related institutions and
stakeholders. These capacity building efforts have established a good foundation for biodiversity
conservation and protected area management in Turkey; increased national capacity will be a lasting
legacy of the project.

3) Evaluation of the Borrower's own performance during the preparation and implementation of
the operation, with special emphasis on lessons learned that may be helpful in the future

The BNRMP started slowly and experienced a number of difficulties and uncertainties, especially up until
June 2003. The World Bank mid-term review mission of October 2003 found the performance of the
project "unsatisfactory". As a result, the General Directorate of Nature Conservation and National Parks
and all project units reviewed their work plans for 2004-2005 and 2006 in accordance with the mid-term
review programs recommended by the World Bank mission. From that time on, it was agreed that the
work of the PAMAs should concentrate on awareness raising, water issues (except for Camili),
management plans, micro plans, the small grants program, visitor center construction (except for Köprülü
Kanyon) and replication activities. In order to complete some key activities under the Small Grants
Program and construction activities, the project got an extension for two years, during which the project
focused mainly on the small grants program, management plans, water issues, and park constructions.

Lessons Learned

Project Component 1: Strengthening the National Framework for Biodiversity Conservation

·   Provision of contributions by relevant institutions is a major pre-requisite for any laws which are
    enforceable.
·   The frequent change of Division Chiefs within the General Directorate made it very difficult to
    maintain continuity in the Learning Network activities.
·   A working collaboration among the relevant institutions is sometimes difficult to achieve, particularly
    where parties see others' initiatives as a threat to themselves.
·   The preparation process for the draft law on biodiversity and nature conservation - which was well
    organized and carried out extensively from 2002 to 2005 with many meetings, working groups and
    face-to-face discussions - has played an important role in raising awareness with respect to nature
    conservation, biodiversity and management of natural resources.
·   Since there are not as many experts as needed to replicate the new approaches in the other forest
    areas, one needs to be very cautious when adding new replication sites so as not to over-extend
    limited staff resources.

Project Component 2: Developing Prototypes for Effective Protected Area Management

·   Planners need to have a "big picture" mentality in order to effectively protect and manage
    biodiversity. They cannot be limited by the established boundaries of the protected area.
·   Establishing a participatory approach is a slow process. It has taken considerable time for planning
    teams to acquire the skills and confidence to work in a participatory way and for local stakeholders to
    be convinced that the intention to consider their interests is really serious.



                                                       34

·   The development and use of rapid ecological assessments should be encouraged. Long-term surveys,
    while they have their value, are too expensive and time-consuming to be of much use in short-term
    projects.
·   Staff continuity is essential for successful management. The PAMA teams established under the
    BNRMP were able to work and learn together about protected area management and became
    increasingly knowledgeable and effective as the project progressed.

4) Evaluation of the performance of the Bank or of other partners during the preparation and
implementation of the operation, with emphasis on lessons learned

The Bank's performance during supervisions was highly satisfactory but replacement of task managers
early during implementation and suspension of missions due to 11th September affected Project activities.
Support from the Country Office could not be achieved regularly throughout the project since the
counterpart in country office has been replaced as well. Also for a time the project has taken direct and
effective support from the World Bank Headquarters. It is important to take regular high level support
from the country office in order to achieve high level support for the project activities at the implementing
agency. For procurement and financial management adequate support has been taken, however it is
important to obtain continuous and sustainable support in trainings on new aspects, contract management
including assigning of individual consultants to different projects.

Other partners

It was a project constraint that Turkey lacks firms or specialists which provide consultancy services on
preparation of participatory protected area management plans. The experienced firms on the topic do not
have representatives in Turkey or may not be well informed about the country, which leads to continuity
problems and deficiencies in the services they provide.

Turkey lacks national expertise in conservation biology and protected area management. Local
consultants faced difficulties in the preparation of flora and fauna surveys, which are adequate for
protected area management needs.

Since Turkey has no fully-equipped protected area management network, the NGOs do not yet have
comprehensive experience on protected area management. The NGOs that show a positive approach to
the tasks they have undertaken gain more and better experience so that they can take on more important
roles in nature conservation in Turkey.

There are problems, especially in accomplishing nationwide collaboration, between the various
governmental agencies involved in protected area management. In projects like this one, where inter-
institutional collaboration is important, the attitudes of the different institutions can be obstructive;
whereas implementation of management plans requires strong collaboration and coordination among
relevant institutions.

5) Description of the proposed arrangements for future operation of the project

The Government of Turkey is committed to strengthen its protected area network as part of its obligations
under the Convention on Biological Diversity. With regard to next steps, it is of great importance that the
management plans prepared for the period 2007-2011 be approved, with appropriate budgets for
implementation. The personnel problem of the PAMAs should be solved to accelerate management plan
activities. The equipment purchased by the project should be used in compliance with its original purpose
and a strategy must be determined to guarantee the proposed indicative budget of the management plans.

       Annex 7. Using the Protected Area Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool in Turkey

The Protected Area Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool1 was prepared to provide an overarching
framework for assessing management effectiveness of both protected areas and protected area systems, to
give guidance to managers and others and to help harmonize assessment around the world. It is organized
around the assessment framework identified by the World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA),
which is summarized in Table 1.

The Tracking Tool is comprised of a questionnaire of 30 questions, scored on a basis of 0 to 3, which
address the 6 themes in the WCPA framework.

Its use was first introduced and piloted in Turkey during the MTR in 2003, when baseline evaluations
were carried out of the four pilot sites with the full involvement and engagement of the 4 project teams. It
was introduced as a self-assessment tool, better to enable management teams to understand where
progress had been good, and where progress had to be made, and particularly to speak and assess
performance frankly. It was not originally intended to be a reporting mechanism, though this is how GEF

has later chosen to use the results. Even by presenting the results here, we are only choosing to do so as a
means of showing that progress was being self-monitored, rather than to suggest that particular
performance targets were being set and assessed using the tracking tool.

Rather than using the gross total scores which were produced by the Tracking Tool, the TTL created a
series of spider graphs, so that baseline performance against each of the 6 WCPA criteria could be
compared over time. The results from the 4 pilot sites are summarized in the charts.

The Tracking Tool was subsequently translated into Turkey and somewhat further refined during
subsequent uses. It has also been used to establish baselines in the project replication sites.
