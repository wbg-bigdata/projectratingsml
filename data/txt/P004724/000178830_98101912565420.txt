1. THE EDUCATICON SECTOR
Overview
1.01      During the last decade Thailand has rapidly expanded its education
systdm (Annex 1). In 1980 primary enrollmient had reached 7.4 million,
representing about 97% of the age-group 7-12. Among the population aged 11
and over the literacy rate was about 85% Icompared with about 50% in the
mid-1950s). Enrollment ratios are 39% at the lower secondary level, 9% at
the upper secondary level, and 3.6% for hLgher education.
1.02      Public education is supported aLmost entirely by central government
funds, claiming about 20% of the national recurrent budget, or US$1.24 bil-
lion, in 1980. Private schools, enrollinlg about one-fifth of students at
the secondary level, receive some subsidies from the Central Government and
must conform to standards set by the Ministry of Education.
1.03      Structure.  In 1978, following the new national education scheme
initiated under the Fourth Development Plan (1977-81), the structure of the
formal education system was changed as follows:
T-able 1.1: OLD AND NEW EDUCATION STRUCTURE
Years of Schooling by Level
Primary       Secondary         Tertiary
Old system (through 1977)           4 + 3         3 + 2 or 3 + 3      4 to 6
New system (from 1978)                6           3 + 3               2 to 6
The change to the new structure has been completed at the primary and lower
secondary levels (Annex 2). Implementation at the upper secondary level
began in 1981 and will be completed in 1983. The new structure provides for
a better integration of the schooling process between the first two levels
of education and within each level. The main characteristics of the new
system are as follows:
(a)  compulsory primary education has been extended from 4 to 6 years as
a step towards an eventual 9-year basic education cycle;
(b)  the new primary school year has been extended from 180 to 200
school days with the result that the number of school days (1,200)
in the new 6-year cycle is abouit equal to the number of school
days (1,260) in the old 7-year primary school cycle;



-2-
(c) the structure has greater flexibility as students may enter and
leave the formal school system at various points, and may benefit
from equivalency provisions in nonformal education which would
count towards their graduation;
(d)  the lower secondary program includes work experience or orienta-
tion through exposure to practical skills; and
(e) the upper secondary program allows students to learn practical
skills for employment when they leave school or for further
studies at the tertiary level.
1.04      Administration.  Responsibilities for educational administration and
planning are shared among several central government agencies.  Educational
administration of primary, secondary and postsecondary (nonuniversity)
education, including teacher training, is under the Ministry of Education
(MIOE). However, while nonformal education is administered primarily by the
Department of Nonformal Education of the MIOE, several other agencies also
administer out-of-school programs, e.g. the Ministries of Agriculture,
Interior, and Public Health. The Government loosely controls private
education which forms an important part of the Thai education system and
accounts for about 10% of primary, 20% of secondary and 10% of higher
education enrollments. The Office of University Affairs, with the status of a
ministry, oversees government universities and private colleges. For
supervisory purposes the MOE has grouped the country's 71 provinces
(changwats), into 12 regions with offices in each region.
1.05      Finance.  Public education is supported almost entirely by the
Central Government. Fees are levied at the secondary and tertiary levels but
cover only 10% and 5% of recurrent costs, respectively. The share of the
central government budget allocated for education grew from 16% in 1970 to 20%
in 1980, and over the same period total education expenditure (public and
private) increased its share in GDP from about 3.5% to 4%. In 1980 public
expenditure by level was divided roughly as follows: 55% primary, 27% secon-
dary, 14% higher and 4% other (including assistance to private schools).
These proportions are in line with averages for other Asian countries. Within
the primary and secondary levels, however, expenditure is unbalanced in terms
of allocations by category and by region: nearly 90% of total expenditure is
recurrent and about 96% of recurrent expenditure is allocated to salaries and
related benefits and less than 3% on materials. Expenditures per student
are significantly lower for the North and Northeast regions than for the
Central and South regions. As a consequence, expenditure for improving
fac:Llities (at about US$2.50 equivalent per student) is inadequate as is
expenditure on other quality improvements (teaching/learning materials and
t eacher upgrading).
Significant Features of the Education System
1.06      Primary Education,  With a 97% participation rate for the age group
7-12 in 1980,Thailand has virtually attained universal primary education.



-3.
With the population growth rate declining to about 2.1%, the National
Education Commission (NEC) has forecast that primary enrollment will reach a
maximum of 7.8 million in 1983 and will remain stable at that level through
1986. While enrollments expanded by about 10% during 1975-79, primary school
teachers increased by 48% in the same period to reach nearly 325,000 in 1979.
The teacher-student ratio improved from 1:39 to 1:26 and the percentage of
unqualified teachers dropped from 15% to 8%.
1.07      Despite these achievements, tae primary subsector has four main
weaknesses: (a) shortage of school plazes, particularly in rural areas;
(b) low quality of primary school teachers in rural areas; (c) poor internal
efficiency; and (d) inappropriate curriculum.
1.08      The Government has a vigorous school construction program to meet
the shortage of school places, with pribrity given to underserved areas.
The quality issue is being addressed by providing better teaching-learning
materials, especially textbooks, and upgrading teacher competency through
in-service training together with better school supervision. As part of the
program to improve quality and efficiency, the structure of primary educa-
tion was changed in 1978 to an integrated 6-year cycle (para. 1.03). Sim-
ultaneously a new curriculum was introduced. The curriculum comprises four
components: basic skills (literacy and numeracy); life experience (home
economics and home mechanics); character education (physical education and
art) and work education (work experience, occupational education). The
table below summarizes the time devoted to the various aspects of the new
primary curriculum.
Table 1.2: MAIN COMPONENTS OF PRIMARY CURRICULUM
Basic          Life           Character         Work
Grade       skills      experience        education       education    Total
1 - 2        50%            15%              25%            10%         100%
3 - 4        35%            20%              25%            20%         100%
5 - 6        25%            25%              20%            30%         100%
1.09      Secondary Education.  In 198C, 1.34 million students were enrolled
in government lower secondary schools and 270,000 in government upper
secondary schools. Enrollment in private secondary schools declined
marginally from 277,000 in 1975 to 268,000 in 1980, but as a portion of the
national total, the decline was from 33% in 1975 to 20% in 1980.  This
decline is expected to continue as private schooling costs rise and students
move to government schools where enrollments are expected to increase.



-4-
1.10      As part of the program to better prepare students for local life,
secondary schooling has been reoriented from a sole preoccupation with pre-
paration for postsecondary education to a wider concern for preparation for
employment. This has been achieved by the introduction in 1978 of a new
diversified secondary curriculum, which supplements traditional academic
subjects with occupational subjects, including work education. Implementa-
tioni of the new curriculum will be completed in 1983. The new diversified
curriculum requires all students to take at least four periods a week of work
education subjects, and in other subject areas there will be an increasing
emphasis on practical and manual activities to balance with theoretical or
academic subjects. Seven distinctive features characterize the new
curriculum:
(a) cognate subjects are integrated into five interrelated areas of
study - language, science and mathematics, social studies,
character development and work education;
(b) literacy in Thai has primary emphasis since studying a foreign
language is no longer compulsory;
(c) the curriculum is terminal for both lower secondary and upper
secondary education;
(d) the teaching-learning process is flexible as students are allowed
and encouraged to fulfill their course requirements in practical
subjects in vocational or skill training centers or through
supervised "home projects" that make greater use of local materials
and resources;
(e)  the content of employment education is localized because it is
increasingly designed at the regional level;
(f)  greater guidance is provided for students to select subjects that
are most consistent with their aptitudes and chances of post-.
graduation employment; and
(g) evaluation or examination is internal to each school, based on the
principle that those who evaluate should be those who teach.
1.11      The 1978 curriculum will be refined through continuous evaluation
to improve the efficiency of secondary education. The following table shows
the basic structure of the 1978 lower secondary curriculum:

1.12      Vocational and Technical Education.  The Department of Vocational
Education (DVE) of the Ministry of Education (MOE) cooperates with other
government agencies and private professional groups to provide a variety of
vocational and technical training programs to meet demands in various regiona.
The DVE runs a three-year vocational training program at the upper secondary
level which includes core vocational units that have a common curriculum with
the compulsory occupational units in the general secondary schools under the
Department of General Education (DGE). The DVE also operates a two-year
program at the postsecondary level, including vocational teacher training, in
technical institutes. In addition, technical training is provided at the
tertiary level by the Institute of Technical and Vocational Education which
has 28 campuses. The polytechnic schools provide a variety of short training
programs. Several other agencies, such as the Department of Labor in the
Ministry of the Interior, also provide vocational and technical training
programs.
1.13      Since the late 1970s, there has been a rapid increase in the demand
for vocational training. In 1981, vocational schools in the Bangkok area
admitted only one in seven applicants. In view of the increased demand and
the development of prevocational courses in the general secondary schools,
there is a need to review the existing system of vocational and technical
training and to plan for the most cost-effective allocation of resources.
This issue will be addressed under the proposed project.
1.14      Nonformal Education.  Thailand is in the process of developing a
nationwide nonformal.education (NFE) system. The Bank is assisting the
Government in this effort under the Fourth Education Project (Loan 1271-TH).
In 1980 the former Adult Education Division of the Ministry of Education was
upgraded to a Department of Nonformal Education. The Government plans to
establish a Lifelong Education Center (LEC) in each changwat (24 are being
established under the Fourth Education Project) in addition to operating 21
Mobile Trade Training Units. Over 700,000 adults participate in various
programs organized by the NFE Department, including general education (mainly
primary equivalence), literacy, vocational and special interest group courses.
An important new initiative is the provision of residential short courses in
the LECs for unemployed youth.
1.15      The Department of Vocational Education provides adult vocational
courses and short trade courses in major cities. Other NFE programs are
offered by the Ministries of the Interior, Agriculture, Health and Industry
as well as by a number of private organizations. The Government plans to
expand NFE partly through the use of radio education for which the Fifth
Education Project (Credit 913-TH) provided support to the Center for
Education Technology.
1.16      Higher Education.  A total of 13 public institutes and universi-
ties and 11 private colleges offer a variety of higher education programs
and training. During the 1960s enrollments grew at about 6% annually.
Recent expansion, averaging 17% per year since 1970, has been more rapid and
enrollments reached about 190,000 in 1979, with Ramkhamhaeng (Open) University



-7-
(established in 1971) accounting for 60% of total enrollment. In general, the
rapid expansion of higher education enrollment was not accompanied by
increased staff and materials support, resulting in a deterioration in
quality.  In order to improve the general quality and external relevance of
higher education the Government restricted postsecondary enrollment expansion
to about 4.5% per year over the Fourth ?lan (1977-81) period. From 1976 to
1979 the actual rate of growth was about 5% per year. However, new opportuni-
ties for those seeking higher education have been made possible through the
establishment of a second open university, Sukhothai Thammathirat, which is
less costly than Ramkhamhaeng as teaching is primarily through radio and
correspondence.
1.17      Teacher Training.  Teacher training is offered at the postsecond-
ary and higher education levels. Primary school teachers are trained mainly
through two-year courses, and secondary school teachers mainly through four-
year courses. The current total annual output of trained teachers is ade-
quate for the planned expansion of the aducation system over the Fifth Plan
period, although there are shortages of trained teachers in certain subject
areas, particularly those related to work education and occupational
subjects in the new secondary curriculum. There is a need to plan carefully
the future output from teacher training programs in relation to projected
needs. This will require greater coordination between the different
departments and institutions producing teachers. This issue is being
addressed under the proposed project.
Sector Strategy
1.18      Government Plans.  Under the 'ifth Development Plan (1982-86)
the Government's main objectives for the education sector are to:
(a) expand educational opportunities and improve quality in formal
and nonformal schooling, in response to local occupational and
cultural needs and to labor market demands; and
(b) improve and maximize efficiency in educational management.
Consistent with these objectives, the Government seeks to expand and improve
educational services in the underserved sections of the population, espe-
cially in rural areas and urban slums. In secondary education the distinc-
tion between academic and vocational streams would be softened by the new
curriculum which places due emphasis on work education and other
occupational subjects.
1.19      The program to attain the above objectives would require a signi-
ficant increase in capital and recurrent: expenditure on education. During
the Fourth Plan period educational expenditure totaled some B 97,500 million,
about 3.4% of GDP. The projected educat:ion budget under the Fifth Plan is
about B 204,000 million, roughly 3% of CDP. The recurrent budget is projected
to be B 162,000 million and the capital budget B 42,000 million, or an average
per year of B 32,400 million and B 8,40(l million respectively. Real GDP
increased at an average annual rate of 7.7% between 1975 and 1980, and the



-8-
nation's population growth rate fell from 2.6% in 1976 to an estimated
2.1% in 1980. Since the GDP is projected to grow at an average annual rate
of 6.6% between 1982 and 1986, the capital and recurrent costs of education
should be within Thailand-s financial capacity, but improvements in manage-
ment and internal efficiency would be necessary to make effective use of
such expenditure.
1.20      Bank Group Participation.  Five Bank loans/credits, totaling
US$106.9 million, have been made to the education sector in Thailand. These
projects have pursued three main objectives, viz. manpower development,
quality improvement and more equitable coverage. More than half Qf the
loan/credit funds have been allocated to general education, with emphasis on
secondary and postsecondary education. This reflects the relatively heavy
input in diversified secondary education. The first project was completed
in 1973, the second and third in 1980 and the other two are in various stages
of implementation. To date, the projects have succeeded in achieving
substantial institutional development within Kasetsart University, the
National Curriculum Development Center and the Department of Nonformal
Education; quality improvements in secondary and higher agricultural
education; and more equitable coverage of secondary education. The projects
have been less successful in producing middle-level skilled manpower since.
many graduates continue on to higher education. The projects have further
shared in inefficiencies in implementation, leading to substantial procure-
ment delays (averaging over two years) under the second and third projects.
These delays have resulted largely from staff inexperience, underbudgeting,
and cumbersome procurement procedures.  Steps have been taken by the
Government to improve implementation performance.
1.21      In the future, Bank Group education lending is expected to concen-
trate on four objectives: :(a) increased equity by expanding opportunities
for basic education; (b) improved quality of education through improvements
in curriculum, instructional materials, teacher training, school adminis-
tration, and educational mass media (particularly radio); (c) middle and
high-level skill development to meet manpower needs in key sectors such as
agriculture and energy; and (d) strengthened educational planning and
management capabilities.
1.22      An OED Project Performance Audit Report (No. 770, dated June 13,
1975) has been prepared on the First Education Project (Loan 471-TH).  The
major audit finding of relevance to the present project is the need for more
efficient use of teachers to improve student/teacher ratios. Under the
present project the Government would prepare a plan to improve teacher utili-
zation.  Further, the project would help to strengthen central planning with
the object of improving the allocation of teacher resources. Audit reports
on the second and third education projects are being prepared.

2. ISSUES IN SECONDARY EDUCATION /1
Overview
2.01-     In view of the rapid social and economic changes taking place in
Thailand, the Government has decided on accelerated and universal improvements
in secondary education. Enrollments in general lower secondary education in
Thailand expanded rapidly during the 1970s, from about 600,000 in 1972 to
about 1.3 million in 1980 (para. 1.09). A slower but still substantial rate
of expansion is envisaged for the Fifth Plan period, to about 1.6 million in
1986. If this expansion is to be successfully carried out, substantial
changes are needed in the secondary sector (a) to improve the education
system's performance relating to access, relevance, quality, and efficiency;
and (b) to strengthen the MOE's planning and management capacity.
Performance Problems
2.02      Regional disparities in participation rates reflect persisting
imbalances in access to secondary education, the most underserved being the
northern and northeastern regions. For the nation as a whole the quality of
education has been depressed by the shortage of specialized teachers in
science and work education subjects, inadequate textbooks, ineffective
teaching methods, and inadequate supervision as well as shortage of physical
facilities.
2.03      Access.  Access to lower secondary education is an important issue
both in absolute terms and in terms of regional disparities. Because of
rapidly rising primary enrollments and a slower expansion of secondary school
places in recent years the transition rate from primary to secondary fell from
61% in 1978 to 46% in 1980. Intake in grade 7 has been held down in the same
period to accommodate the enrollment bu:Lge caused by the transition from the
old to the new secondary cycle and tota:L lower secondary enrollments, which
fell in 1981, are expected to rise again in 1982. The target for the
expansion of public lower secondary education adopted by the NEC for the Fifth
Plan period implies an annual enrollmeni: increase of 6.5% over the period
1980-86. This is a realistic rate, which may be compared with an annual
growth rate of 13.6% over the period 197'2-78. The Fifth Plan target would
increase the participation rate in public lower secondary schools from 30% in
1980 to 41% in 1986. When expected enrollments in private schools are
included the participation rate would ri.se from 39% in 1980 to 46% in 1986.
Based on primary enrollment projections, the transition rate to lower
secondary would reach about 55% in 1986.
/1  The discussion refers specifically to the lower secondary cycle,
although the issues in general apply also to the upper secondary cycle.

2.04      Although regional disparity in secondary enrollments has been
narrowed significantly from 1973 to 1980, as shown in Table 2.1, considerable
imbalances remain in participation rates between and within regions. While
overall disparity, as indicated by the Gini coefficient, has been reduced by
about 60% from 1973 to 1980, Thailand's north and northeast regions generally,
and Yala province in the south particularly, lag behind the rest of the
country. Access disparity is also evident within different administrative
leve:Ls. Only 10% of tambons or subdistricts are served by secondary schools
(Table 2.2). The Fifth Five-Year Plan gives priority to improving access to
secondary education in the most disadvantaged regions in order to narrow
disparities in secondary enrollments.

2.05      Facilities.  The quality of rural secondary school facilities,
particularly those limited to the lower cycle, tends to be much lower than
the larger urban schools. They often consist of a small permanent building to
which the villagers have added temporary structures using local materials.
As the schools lack basic equipment and resource materials, it is difficult
to attract sufficiently qualified teachers to them. The absence of workshops
has also impeded the teaching of work education subjects. Many students
from better off rural families bypass the small school in their own locality
to gain admission to the larger schools providing both lower and upper
secondary levels which are concentrated in Bangkok and the changwat capitals.
With the aim of improving secondary education facilities, the DGE, with
initial Government funds and assistance from the Ford Foundation, and NEC
with subsequent assistance under the Fifth Education Project, have carried
out a school mapping exercise covering all secondary schools and a compre-
hensive information system is being established for planning the development
of the secondary school system. A range of school models based on standard
numbers of classes and related to catchmeat areas and numbers of feeder
schools has been developed. The school models are of three kinds: 4-4-4,
6-6-6 or 8-8-8, depending on whether they have 4, 6 or 8 classes in each
grade. Schools are to be improved in accord with these models to a minimum
standard of 12, 18 or 24 classes. The maximum class size would be 45
students. To widen access, rural lower secondary schools should be upgraded
to the standard of any of the above models and provided with adequate equip-
ment and teaching-learning materials. To attract sufficient qualified
teachers to rural schools, improved incentives should be provided to teachers
to teach in rural areas.
2.06      Relevance and Quality.  The 1978 diversified secondary curriculum
with its emphasis on work-related activities is meant to provide a more
relevant education to the majority of stuclents than the traditional curri-
culum, which stressed academic subjects arnd prepared students for higher



-12 -
education. But the implementation of the 1978 curriculum has been hampered
by two main issues which also adversely affect the quality of education:
inadequate preparation of teachers to teach the new curriculum, and insuffi-
cient provision of materials, equipment and physical facilities as logisti-
cal support, particularly in the smaller lower secondary schools in the rural
areas. Despite the program during the last decade to improve secondary
schools in terms of physical facilities, equipment and materials, and better
quality teachers and school administrators, a total of only 144 schools had
been diversified by 1980./1 These schools cover 10% of all secondary schools
and about 20% of enrollment.  About 1,300 secondary schools need further
improvement and development.
2.07      The decision to implement the new curriculum in 1978 did not allow
sufficient time to prepare teachers for the changes in educational orientation
and the introduction of new subjects in work education. The new curriculum,
which provides for compulsory and elective subjects, is organized into five
integrated areas: language; science and mathematics; social studies;
character development; and work education (see Table 1.3, page 5). While the
study of a foreign language is no longer mandatory, the introduction of work
education as a compulsory subject provides students an opportunity to learn
basic "living skills" and exposes them to a broader range of subjects and
skills on which to base their future choice of a career. Additionally, there
is greater emphasis on guidance in relation to the choice of elective subjects
which are expected to prepare students for employment as well as for contin-
uing their education at the upper secondary level. The overall responsibility
for curriculum development, including design of learning materials, rests with
the National Curriculum Development Center (NCDC) which has also been respon-
sible for organizing the in-service training of teachers to implement the new
curriculum. (Assistance was provided to NCDC by the World Bank Group under
Credit 369-TH.) A sister institution, the Institute for the Promotion of
Teaching Science and Technology (IPTST) has special responsibility for science
curricula and the design of prototype science equipment.
2.08      Budgetary and time constraints dictated the adoption of the-"echo"
system of in-service teacher training to implement the new curriculum. The
NCDC and the IPTST organize courses in their respective subject areas for
secondary school supervisors and other staff from the regional education
offices and for teacher training college tutors. These people are then
responsible for training leader teachers from the school clusters who in turn
are expected to train other teachers in their subject areas within the school
cluster.  The plan is to train all subject teachers for a particular grade in
the year prior to the introduction of the new curriculum in that grade, in
addition to training school administrators. The system, however, resulted in
a backlog of teachers waiting to be retrained. Although the new curriculum
was introduced in all lower secondary grades by 1981 only about 70% of lower
secondary science and mathematics teachers had received any training. A more
/1 An additional 65 secondary schools are being diversified under the
ongoing Fifth Education Project (Credit 913-TH).



serious problem relates to the training of work education teachers. There is
a shortage of specialized teachers, particularly in industrial arts, to teach
work education in all schools. However, the subject content is sufficiently -
basic and simple for general subject t(eachers to teach work education after
the appropriate in-service training.
2.09      Parallel with inadequately prepared teachers is the insufficiency of
instructional materials, classroom equipment and facilities, and supervisory
support for teachers through the regional education offices. Although new
textbooks have been produced, not all students can afford to buy them, and
most school libraries are poorly stocked.  Most schools lack general science
equipment as well as the specialized facilities or equipment for teaching work
education and prevocational subjects. To improve the relevance and quality of
education, lower secondary schools should be provided with appropriate
instructional materials, equipment and facilities and adequately trained
teachers.
2.10      Internal Efficiency and Teacher Utilization.  While the internal
efficiency of lower secondary education in Thailand is high, as indicated by
high transition rates, averaging 97%, of students progressing from one grade
level to the next, the teacher utilization rate in classroom teaching is
low./l Analyses of typical lower secondary school timetables for teachers
show that an average teacher has only 16 teaching periods or 13-1/2 hours out
of a maximum of 35 periods or 29 hours per week. The rest of the teacher's
time is spent on preparation work and extracurricular in-school activities,
*including administrative tasks. The low average teaching load is reflected in
the low teacher-student ratio of 1:18 in 1980 compared with 1:22 in 1976, and
a class-teacher ratio of 1:2.2 in 1980 as against 1:1.9 in 1976, despite the
fact that the average class size has remained at over 40 students. Compared
with other countries in the region, Thailand has the lowest teacher-student
ratio, as shown in Table 2.3.
/1 The same issue was highlighted in 11975 by the Project Completion Report
on Thailand's First Education Projezt (Loan 471-TH) dealing with
vocational schools where, out of 40 weekly school hours, only 24 were
spent in activities directly related to teaching and 12 hours of direct
student contact per week.

2.11      The low teacher utilization rate reflects inadequate planning and
management. Overall efficiency would be improved by raising the teacher-
student ratio which would require teachers to spend more time in direct
student contact. Even a modest improvement in the teacher utilization rate
would result in substantial recurrent cost savings. Table 2.4 shows the
financial implications of an adjustment in the teacher-student ratio from 1:18
to 1:22 in 1982-1986. A teacher-student ratio of 1:18 in 1986 would cost
US$456 per student enrolled, compared to US$373 with a ratio of 1:22, a
difference of 22% per student. The cumulative difference in teacher-years
over the period 1982-1986 would be 87,800, corresponding to an estimated
saving of about US$175 million (based on an average annual teacher salary of
US$2,000). Such a saving would more than offset the increased staffing costs
resulting from the introduction of the new curriculum. To improve teacher
utilization and reduce the unit cost of students enrolled, the average weekly
classroom teaching periods for teachers and the average teacher-student ratio
should be increased.

Management Constraints
2.12      The principal agencies of the Ministry of Education (MOE) involved
in secondary education are, in the MOE, the Department of General Education
(DGE) and the Division of Educational P]anning of the Office of the Under-
Secretary of State for Education; and, 'n the field, the regional education
offices and the provincial education offices. In addition, other key
government agencies involved are the National Education Commission (NEC); the
National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB); and the Budget Bureau,
all in the Office of the Prime Minister.. The management structure as
presently organized lacks a strong central agency to direct and coordinate
educational planning and administration within the MOE and between the MOE
and other ministries. Competent managemlent of scarce resources requires a
better integrated system of planning, monitoring and evaluation than
presently exists. The present fragmented responsibilities for management of
the sector have resulted in a weak articulation of planning activities of
the different departments of the MOE anc. an ineffective allocation of
resources between subsectors and between projects. The uneconomic utiliza-
tion of teachers (para. 2.10) is one exm.mple of the ineffective allocation
of resources. The functions and staffing of the key agencies involved with
education and manpower planning need to be oriented towards more effective
planning and management of human resources.
2.13      Central Planning and Management.  The main issue in the management
of the education sector as a whole is the inefficient allocation and utili-
zation of resources. Generally, short-term budgetary considerations take
precedence over long-term objectives and. broad development policies. A
major lacuna in the planning system is the lack of effective annual



- 16 -
planning, which serves as the bridge between long-term planning and annual
budgeting.  This may be explained by the absence of both a comprehensive
management information system and of continuous sectoral planning to provide
the operational framework for setting priorities and targets, outlining
strategies and programs, and guiding project planning and budgeting. Within
the-MOE, the weakness in planning and budgeting stems from the fact that the
MOE-s educational management responsibilities have outgrown the capability
of its central planning agency, the Division of Educational Planning, which
consequently has suffered a loss of influence and effectiveness. Where it
should play a key role in formulating sectoral plans and policies and coord-
inating the development plans and programs of the various departments, the
Division has practically no influence in the decision-making process.
Instead, the MOE's departments with their own separate planning units are
liable to bypass the Division where possible, dealing directly with the
National Economic and Social Development Board or the Budget Bureau, two of
the national agencies concerned with resource allocation. Thus, the indi-
vidual departments, rather than the Division, effectively have been respon-
sible for planning and securing their annual budgets, a system that often
gives rise to competition for resources and financial duplication between
departments. Additionally, the departmental planning units compete for the
limited number of qualified personnel. However, many staff members lack
appropriate knowledge and skills in planning and have to rely on haphazard,
on-the-job training.
2.14      The fragmentation of management responsibilities makes effective
overall administration and planning difficult. Responsibility for a partic-
ular subsector is often shared by different departments. For example, pre-
primary and primary education is under the Office of the National Primary
Education Commission and the Office of the Private Education Commission;
secondary education is administered by the Department of General Education,
the Department of Vocational Education and the Private Education Commission
through private schools; teacher training is under the Department of Teacher
Training, the Institute of Technology and Vocational Education and the
Office of State Universities; and provision of nonformal education is shared
by the Department of Nonformal Education and the Ministries of Agriculture,
Interior and Public Health. As the Division of Educational Planning is
weak, there is practically no coordination between and within various educa-
tional levels. The lack of manpower planning is reflected in the failure to
articulate formal and nonformal vocational/technical skill training. The
introduction of the new (1978) secondary school curriculum was not linked
with prompt adjustments in the programs of teacher training institutions
responsible for preparing teachers who have to implement it.
2.15      The National Education Commission, located in the Office of the
Prime Minister, has a policy-formulating brief, with a responsibility for
the review and evaluation of the education system at all levels, but it has
no control over the MOE's departments. The NEC has also been disadvantaged
by a shortage of qualified staff in planning. Policy is formally enunciated
in the Five-Year Plan, prepared with inputs from the MOE-s Division of



- 17 -
Educational Planning, the NEC, the NESDB, and the Committee of the Under-
Secretary of State composed of the Directors-General of MOE departments or
their representatives. However, the fragmented planning system is not
conducive to a comprehensive translation of national education policy into
viable programs and projects.  The weakness in planning is compounded by the
lack-of a reliable national data base for systematic analysis of sector
issues.
2.16      The MOE's lack of sectoral devrelopment strategies and plans has been
an impediment to the efficient use of resources for educational and manpower
development in Thailand. The causes are the shortage of planning expertise in
the MOE, NEC and NESDB, and the lack of consistent coordination in social and
economic planning between them. To improve the Government-s overall capacity
for educational and manpower planning and policy formulation and advance the
goal of an integrated planning system, l:he planning agencies of the MOE, NEC
and NESDB should be strengthened by a sl:aff development program and, in the
case of the MOE, by organizational restructuring as well.  Studies should also
be carried out on issues related to plaining and management. To improve over-
all national planning, the NEC should be assigned the responsibility for
interministerial coordination in social and economic planning.
2.17      Regional Management.  The main issue in regional management is the
inability of the regional education offices (REOs) to maintain efficiency and
improve quality in secondary education, due to inadequacy in staffing,
facilities, equipment and budgeting.
2.18      Each of the 12 educational regions (see map) has a regional educa-
tion office responsible directly to the Office of the Under-Secretary of State
for Education in the MOE. Each REO is hieaded by a regional education officer
assisted by administrative and service staff appointed by the Office of the
Under-Secretary. Each REO has two or tlhree supervisory units, one each for
general education, physical education and/or vocational education, staffed by
the respective departments of the MOE.
2.19      The REOs presently have four inain functions:
(a) coordination of activities by institutions and agencies at
regional level under the MOE and other ministries relating to
education, culture and community development matters and general
guidance of educational development in line with official
policies;
(b)  supervision of vocational, physical and general (academic) educa-
tion; provision of in-service teacher training; and implementation
of technical jobs initiated bir the REOs themselves or delegated by
the departments of the MOE;
(c)  production and distribution of teaching-learning materials, such
as teacher manuals, students supplementary readers or texts
relevant to local needs; and



- 18 -
(d)  research and evaluation, including designing standardized tests,
with the focus on topics relevant to regional or local issues,
such as enrichment or remedial Thai language courses for non-Thai
speaking students and nonattendance or dropout problems in remote
areas.
2.20      There are substantial difficulties in carrying out these diverse
functions. The Regional Education Officer's power of coordination is limited
by the MOE's centralized decision-making process, which requires that signifi-
cant matters be referred back to the departments concerned in the MOE. The
weakness in coordination at the central level is reflected at the regional
level. In-service teacher training suffers from a lack of funds and staff,
made more acute by the demands of the new secondary education, especially in
technical subjects. School supervision is restricted by inadequate budgets
for school visits. The effectiveness of supervisors is vitiated by unrealis-
tic demands which require them to serve as in-service teacher trainers and
writers of instructional materials and to carry out research. These multiple
responsibilities are not conducive to the development of expertise in any
field and are detrimental to the quality of school supervision. Similarly,
the production and distribution of teaching-learning materials, and research
and evaluation are hampered by the lack of funds and specialist staff.
2.21      The functions and responsibilities of the REOs need to be ration-
alized and their effectiveness improved by providing them with adequate
equipment and the appropriate resources for staff development.
2.22      ?rovincial Management.  The main issue in provincial management is
the fragmentation of management responsibilities arising from the lack of
staff trained in planning and the absence of an integrated planning system.
In the 71 provinces the provincial education offices (PEOs) in theory repre-
sent the Office of the Under-Secretary of State of the Ministry of Education
(MOE) and should serve as coordinating agencies for all MOE departments at
the provincial level. In practice, however, individual provincial depart-
ments and educational institutions report directly to the MOE's central
agencies. Without effective horizontal linkages between provincial agen-
cies, there is a lack of coordination in the provincial management of
education. Although responsibility for provincial planning since 1977 has
been vested in provincial planning units attached to the offices of the
provincial governors, the shortage of trained and experienced planning staff
has resulted in poor coordination and integration of provincial educational
and manpower planning and a failure to bridge the gap between local and
national educational planning and management. To strengthen provincial
management, there should be a program of staff development in planning and
management and introduction of a system of educational planning that would
articulate provincial and national planning.
Government Plans and Strategy for Secondary Education Development
2.23      Consistent with the objectives to widen opportunities and improve
quality, relevance and efficiency in schooling as well as to improve and



- 19 -
maximize efficiency in educational management, the Government plans to
increase the participation rate in lower secondary education, covering the
age group 13-15, from 39% in 1980 to 46% in 1986, with corresponding
enrollments projected to rise from 1.3 million in 1980 to 1.7 million in
1986. Simultaneously the Government plans to strengthen the planning and
management capabilities of central, regional and provincial planning and
management agencies.
2.24      Strategy.  To achieve the aim of increased participation rates in
lower secondary education, the Government plans to meet all requirements
to accomodate a projected expansion of about 400,000 places by providing
new facilities and replacing 50% of temporary places (total 340,000) which
are designated as dilapidated and overdue for replacement. Improvement in
relevance and quality would be achieved by government plans: (a) to provide
workshops, laboratories and other facilities together with adequate equip-
ment and teaching materials for the teaching of work education as well as
general subjects; and (b) to upgrade the skills of teachers through in-ser-
vice training. To meet the goal of improving efficiency in educational
management, the Government plans to introdiuce needed organizational changes
in selected central and regional planning of management agencies in step
with projected staff development in planning and management skills. These
agencies include the National Education Commission, the Population and
Manpower Planning Division of NESDB, and the MIOE's Division of Educational
Planning and the Regional Education Offices.
2.25      External Assistance.  The Governiment expects to finance its lower
secondary expansion and improvement with Lts own resources and assistance
from IBRD. Multilateral aid is being provided from UNESCO/UNDP.
3. THE PROJECT
Objectives and Scope
3.01      The Thai education system is characterized by an overly academic
bias, regional disparities in opportunities for education, inefficient
teacher utilization, and ineffective educational and manpower planning and
management. The proposed project would assist the Government in addressing
these weaknesses by pursuing two broad ob;jectives, as follows:
(a)  to improve the lower secondary education performance in dis-
advantaged areas relating to access, relevance, quality and
efficiency by (i) providing new and renovated classrooms, new
workshops and laboratories, materials, in-service staff training
and technical assistance; and (ii) improving teacher utilization
through an increase in the averz.ge weekly teaching periods; and



- 20 -
(b) to strengthen the national capacity of education and manpower
planning and management by (i) introducing systemic improvements
in the central planning agency of the Ministry of Education, and
(ii) providing technical assistance, training, equipment and
materials to the central, regional, and provincial planning
agencies of the Ministry of Education, the National Education
Commission, and the National Economic and Social Development
Board.
The project would involve the Ministry of Education, the National Education
Commission, and the National Economic and Social Development Board, The
project would provide: (a) improved facilities to about 480 lower secondary
schools with a maximum capacity of about 335,000 student places; and (b)
local and overseas staff training for about 1,430 persons.
Secondary Schools (US$142.9 million equivalent, excluding contingencies)
3.02      This project component would address the access, relevance, quality
and efficiency issues in secondary education through general upgrading of
selected secondary schools, furthering the implementation of the diversified
curriculum, improving the professional competencies of teaching and non-
teaching staff of the project schools, and improving teacher utilization.
3.03      Improvement of Facilities.  To improve quality and access in
secondary education (para. 2.03) about 480 relatively disadvantaged lower
secondary schools in rural areas have been selected for assistance. The
following criteria were used in the selection process:
(a) the school is located in one of the officially designated rural
poverty districts that have been accorded development priority
under the Fifth Plan;
(b) the school is located in an area with a low transition rate from
P6 (the last grade at primary level) to Ml;
(c) the school in academic year 1981 had a minimum of 70 and a
maximum of 400 students enrolled in Ml (the first grade in the
secondary level);
(d)  the school has a good access road and can be provided with water
and electricity; and
(e) the school site is large enough (generally about 35 rai or 6 ha)
to accommodate proposed construction while leaving spaces adequate
for outdoor activities.



- 21 -
Schools designated for inclusion in the pi^oject may be replaced by others
during implementation only if they meet the above criteria. The number of
project schools and their enrollment capacity are shown in Table 3.1.
The number of project schools represents about 54% of all lower secondary
schools; a later second-phase project wou'Ld upgrade the remaining schools.
During negotiations the Government and the Bank reached agreement on
criteria for the selection of lower secondary schools requiring upgrading of
physical facilities.

/a  The estimated total cost per student place based on 540 places in the
4-4-4 model schools is US$890 at April. 1982 prices. For Bank projects
dealing with secondary general/diversified education during FY78-80,
the corresponding median cost was US$995 in mid-1980 prices.
3.04      Under the project, the 480 projEct schools would be provided with
new classrooms, if required to replace existing temporary facilities or to
meet projected enrollment requirements (para. 2.06), as well as workshops,
laboratories and other facilities which will enable the new diversified
curriculum to be introduced. Needed equipment and furniture would also be
provided. Table 3.2 shows the distribution of existing (usable) facilities
among project schools and the new accommocations required. The types and
numbers of workshops for each school model, are listed in Table 3.3. The
types and amount (as indicated by estimatEd cost) of equipment and materials
are summarized in Table 3.4.

3.05      Teaching Programs.  With the proposed upgrading of facilities, it
would be possible for all project schools to follow the new lower secondary
curriculum comprising both compulsory sub-lects and electives. Work education
would be a compulsory subject for all students and would emphasize practice
rather than theory. Within the work educE.tion component all students would
be required to take the home management ccurse and in addition may choose
among courses in home economics, agriculttre and industrial arts. In
practice, the smaller schools would be ab]e to offer a limited range of
occupational courses whereas the largest Echools would be able to offer a
fuller range of occupational courses as bcth compulsory and elective
subjects. The syllabus would also be adapted to the needs of the students
and the community and would take advantage of agricultural activities and
nonfarm enterprises in the surrounding area to provide students with
opportunities for field work.
3.06      In-service Staff Training.  To improve the quality of teaching and
learning in project schools, about 3,720 teachers and administrators would
be provided in-service training. For teachers, including about 480 part-time
community teachers one for each of the project schools, training would
involve three groups: (a) those with no professional qualifications but with
experience in teaching; (b) experienced and qualified teachers with no
training in practical arts; (c) experienced and qualified teachers who need
to be introduced to the concept of greater community participation. The



- 24 -
training would deal with content and teaching methods in home mechanics,
home economics, agriculture and industrial arts. The part-time community
teachers would be recruited to supplement with teaching specific skills such
as fruit and vegetable cultivation, cooking, small engine repair, etc. This
approach has been successfully used by the Nonformal Education Department in
the-operation of "interest group" courses for the out-of-school population.
3.07      In order that project schools can keep their equipment (in general

good working order, about 540 staff would be provided training in maintenance
and repair of equipment at the School Equipment Center in Don Muang district,
financed under Credit 369-TH, and at regional centers. Another 3,160 non-
teaching staff, including principals, librarians, school counsellors and
community development officers, would be provided short training in their
respective areas of responsibility. The in-service training requirements are
summarized in Table 3.5.

3.08       The principal training agency would be the Supervisory Unit of the
Department of General Education in conjunction with other agencies concerned
such as the Departments of Vocational Education, Nonformal Education, Teacher
Training and Community Development. In order to train a maximum number of
staff with limited resources, echo training (para. 2.08), although less than
ideal, would be used whereby central supErvisors would train regional
supervisors from the 12 regional centers, and they in turn would train the
teachers at the regional centers. All training courses would be held in
step with the development of the project schools.  Seminars for principals,
assistant principals and practical arts department heads would be held at
selected regional centers by the DGE's Supervisory Unit.  Outcomes of the
seminars would be used as the basis for further improvement of training and
curriculum implementation in the followirLg phase. In each implementation
phase, training would be carried out in t;he following sequence:
(a)  overseas training /1 for resource personnel from the schools and
the DGE;
(b) in-country training by overseas-trained resource personnel for
trainers from schools and the DGE; and
(c) training of practical arts teachers and nonteaching staff, and
seminars for principals, assistant principals, and practical arts
department heads by the Supervisory Unit at selected regional
centers.
3.09       Output.  When fully operational, the project schools would have a
maximum enrollment of about 335,000 studEnts (26% of total lower secondary
enrollments) and are expected to graduate about 111,000 students (24% of total
lower secondary graduates) each year. About 80% of lower secondary graduates
are expected to continue their education at the upper secondary level.
3.10       Teacher Utilization. As menticined in paragraph 2.10, poor teacher
utilization at the. secondary school level. adds significantly to educational
costs.  The Government has prepared draft. plans for improving teacher utili-
zation at the secondary level for implementation under the project.  The
objective would be to increase the average weekly teaching periods from the
current 16 per week (13-1/2 hours) to 18 per week (15 hours). With a maxi-
mum of 35 class periods per week, this change would represent an improvement
from 46% to 51% in the classroom teaching utilization rate. More efficient
use of teachers would allow-an increase i.n the average teacher-student ratio
from 1:18 to 1:20 (without necessarily increasing class size) and reduce the

agency of SEAMEO (South-East Asian Ministers of Education Organization)
based in Manila, the Philippines. INNOTECH has successfully organized
training courses for the Community Secondary Schools project component

expenditure on teacher salaries significantly. Meeting these targets would,
for example, translate by 1986 into annual recurrent expenditure savings of
US$3 million for the project schools or over US$17 million for all lower
secondary schools. During negotiations it was agreed that the finalized
plans for improving teacher utilization would be submitted to the Bank by
December 31, 1983, for an exchange of views and appropriate follow-up.
3.11      Teacher Incentives.  Rural schools find it difficult to attract
sufficiently qualified teachers for a variety of reasons: distance from
amenities of urban communities, reduced opportunities for supplementary
income, and relatively poor physical facilities and teaching materials. The
project is addressing this issue for project schools by improving the quali-
fications of existing teachers through training and improving the classroom
environment through improved facilities and materials. The Government
already provides housing and scholarships for rural teachers but additional
incentives, such as improved promotion prospects or salary supplements
are required to offset the natural attraction of urban locations. During
negotiations Government agreed to undertake a study on incentives to attract
and retain teachers in rural areas, and to furnish its recommendations to.
the Bank by December 31, 1984. After an exchange of views between the Bank
and the Government, appropriate measures would be taken.
Planning and Management (US$5.6 million, excluding contingencies)
3.12      This project component would improve the Government's overall
capacity for educational and manpower planning and help develop an integrated
planning system in which there would be effective coordination of departmental
and ministerial planning and policy formulation within and between the MOE,
NEC and NESDB. It would also strengthen the linkages between central and
regional or provincial planning and management agencies.
3.13      Central and Provincial Staff Development.  The objective of this
project component is to develop an integrated planning system that would
coordinate the management of resources at ministerial level as well as
between central and provincial planning units. This would be achieved by
(i) entrusting the NEC with responsibility for overseeing and coordinating
interministerial planning; (ii) restructuring and strengthening the Division
of Educational Planning to enable it to formulate sectoral plans and poli-
cies and coordinate development plans of the MOE departments; (iii) under-
taking a study to clarify the planning functions of, and relationship
between, the NEC, NESDB and the Division of Educational Planning; and
(iv) provision of technical assistance and training in planning and
management. During negotiations, the Government agreed that it would, by
January 31, 1983, submit plans to the Bank for expanding NEC's responsibi-
lities and for strengthening the Division of Educational Planning in MOE,
and thereafter implement the plan after an exchange of views with the Bank.

3.14      In order to strengthen staff expertise in planning and management,
training would be provided for the Division of Educational Planning, depart-
mental planning units, the Office of the National Primary Education Commis-
sion, the Central Procurement Unit, and the 71 provincial planning units of
the MOE; the Population and Manpower Planning Division of NESDB; and the
NEC. Overseas and local fellowships would be provided to these agencies for
short courses as well as higher degree stu(dies in manpower and educational
planning and in related subjects such as statistics, demography, computer
science, educational measurement and educational administration. The pro-
ject would finance about 40 man-years of overseas fellowships for 50 staff
and 6 man-years of local fellowships for 4 staff of the central planning
agencies. The project would also finance about 260 man-years of local staff
training, including workshops and seminars. The training would focus on
operational issues such as manpower and educational planning techniques,
developing an effective management informc.tion system, program or project
planning and budgeting, and project monitoring and evaluation. The training
programs, comprising short courses and workshops, would be carried out at
the central and regional levels by NEC, REOs and NESDB for 51, 12 and
14 persons respectively, and at the provincial level by EPD and other MOE.
departments for 143 persons, ONPEC for 73 persons, and NEC for 1,080 per-
sons, whose training would focus on micro-planning techniques. The project
would also provide some equipment to the Division of Educational Planning
and the NEC. Table 3.6 summarizes the staff development program. The
Government would select staff for overseas fellowships under agreed terms
and conditions, including specification cf the field of study.
3.15      Regional Management.  To improve regional management (para. 2.17),
the project would provide technical assistance and training to help ration-
alize the management and organization of REOs as well as to improve capa-
bilities in school supervision, curriculuim research and instructional
materials development. The project includes the provision of 3 man-years of
local consulting services and a total of 4 man-years of local fellowships.
The Government would select staff for local fellowships based on agreed
criteria and determine the terms and conditions for fellowships, including
specification of the field of study. During project implementation the
Government would submit to the Bank progress reports on the improvement of
the REOs' management and organization.
3.16      The project would also help strengthen the REOs in the four major
geographical regions: Region 3 (Songkh'a-south), Region 6 (Lopburi-central),
Region 7 (Phitsanulok-north), and Region 11 (Nakhon Ratchasima-northeast).
The Government has already started work on improving the REOs in these four
regions as the first phase of a plan to improve the management of all 12
REOs in the country. The objective is to enable the REOs to improve the
quality and effectiveness of secondary education through more comprehensive
supervision of schools and in-service teacher training, production and dis-
semination of supplementary instructional materials, and research into local

educational problems. As part of the strategy to achieve these objectives,
the Government would provide office equipinent and furniture and reference
materials for curriculum development and production of teaching-learning
materials. The Government would also provide each of the REOs with the
following additional staff: one Assistant Regional Education Officer, five
technical staff, four support staff, and varying numbers of supervisors.
The technical staff would support the REOs' research and experimentation,
audio-visual and other services, and the increased production of instruc-
tional materials and standardized tests. The REOs' training functions would
be strengthened by staff from the teachec training colleges. While schools
are expected to increase by an average of five per year per region, the
ratio of supervisors to schools would improve slightly from 1:10 to 1:8.
With enhanced capacity each REO, on average, would be able to increase its
major functions per year as shown in Table 3.7. Tables 3.8 and 3.9 summar-
ize the expected changes in staffing of the REOs. During negotiations, it
was agreed with the Government that additional staff for the four REOs in
Regions 3, 6, 7 and 11 would be appointed in accord with an agreed schedule.

3.17      Studies and Preparation of Future Projects.  The project would
assist the Government with planning and management studies and preparation
of future projects (para 2.16). Three major areas have been identified for
priority studies: vocational and technical education and manpower needs,
teacher training, and educational planning. The study on vocational and
technical education and manpower needs wouldl focus on the current and pros-
pective needs of vocational and technical manpower in view of the structural
changes in the agricultural and industrial sectors. A study of the preser-
vice and in-service teacher training would be carried out to rationalize the
articulation of various parts of the teacher training system, particularly
the Teacher Training Colleges, the Regional Education Offices, the Provin-
cial Primary Education Offices, the Technical Colleges and Srinakharinwirot
University. The proposed study on educational planning would examine
current problems in inter-ministerial and interdepartmental planning in
order to devise an effective integrated planning system. Provision is made
for other studies to be included in the couirse of project implementation.
Technical assistance would be provided as :follows: (a) studies: local
consultants - 25 man-months, foreign consultants - 31 man-months; (b) pre-
paration of future projects:  local consultants - 57 man-months, foreign
consultants - 72 man-months. The studies would be carried out in accordance
with agreed terms of reference.
3.18      Monitoring and Evaluation.  The project would help establish pro-
cedures for, and implementation of, monitoring and evaluation of the pro-
ject. For the Lower Secondary Schools conmponent, the procedures should
build on the experience gained in evaluating the Community Secondary Schools
in the Fifth Education Project. A monitor-'lng team in the MOE would be res-
ponsible for coordinating the collection and analysis of data on the pro-
curement and use of the physical facilities provided under the project; on
the numbers and types of teachers trained under the project; on the utiliza-
tion of teachers in all project schools, including longitudinal information
on teaching loads, broken down by the teacher's subject area, school size
and location; on school operating costs; and on student enrollments, atten-
dance, dropout behavior, and in-school performance. Tracer studies would be
conducted, for an adequate sample of project schools, to determine the
whereabouts and education/work experiences of graduates of the lower second-
ary schools. Comparable information would be collected for a sample of
students who do not continue on to secondary education after completing
primary education and for another sample who attend the non-project schools.
Technical assistance would comprise 37 man-months of local consultants and
47 man-months of foreign consultants.
3.19      In addition, the National Education Commission would undertake
separate mid-term and final evaluations of all project components. The NEC
would make use of the data provided by the MOE monitoring team and assess the
planning, implementation, and impact of the project components to determine
the extent to which the objectives are being met and to identify the major
strengths and weaknesses of the project. The evaluations of the staff
development programs in the MOE, NEC and NESDB would focus on the
effectiveness of local and foreign training and of organizational and
procedural changes in the MOE, NEC and NESDB's planning, budgeting and
management functions. The evaluations should include, among other things,
progress in coordination in departmentaL operations.

3.20      Technical Assistance.  Consultant services and fellowships to be
provided under the project for planning and management are summarized in
Table 3.10. A total of 51 overseas and 4 local fellowships, amounting to
42.3 man-years and 6 man-years, respectively, would be provided to the MIOE,
NEC and NESDB for developing staff expertise in planning and management
(det-ails in para. 3.13). Local and foreign consultant services would be
provided to design and implement programs for local staff in-service training
in planning and management for the MOE, NEC and NESDB, and to assist the MlOE
in project implementation. For the REOs, local consultant services would be
provided to assist in curriculum research and development, and in-service
training and supervision methods. The Government would appoint consultants
under agreed terms and conditions of employment.

4.02      Base cost estimates refer to April 1982 prices (Annex 3). Esti-
mates of construction costs are based on bids for construction of buildings
similar to those proposed for the project, which would be functional in
design and be simple structures mainly of local materials. Site develop-
ment costs are on the average estimated at 17% of construction costs; the
cost of professional services /1 included in the project for 280 schools
(services for 200 schools would be financed under Loan 1271-TH) is estimated
at 1.5% of the cost of civil works and covers soil investigation, and labor-
atory tests and reports at US$870 and US$220 per site respectively; topo-
graphical surveys of 180 man-months at US$945 per man-month, and of working
drawings of about 100 man-months at US$820 per man-month. The salaries of
clerks of works are estimated at 0.5% of the cost of civil works (240 man-
years at US$2,610 per man-year) ; and furniture at 10% of construction
costs. Equipment cost estimates are based on preliminary equipment lists
which were reviewed during appraisal and found reasonable. The cost of
/1 These are engineering and architectural services for civil works. All
other services are referred to as "consultant services."

teacher training for the project's lower secondary school teachers is
estimated at B 2,000 (about US$90) per trainee, and allowances are made for
planning and management, studies, evaluation and monitoring, and for the
preparation of future projects.  The cost of specialist (expatriate)
services, including salaries, housing allcwances and airfares is estimated
at US$8,000/ man-month.  The cost of local specialist services is estimated
at US$2,500! man-month. Foreign fellowship costs are estimated at
US$1,500/man-month and local fellowship cc,sts at US$500/manmonth. Costs for
these components are in line with current costs.
4.03      The use factors of workshops are 70% for the Model 01 and 03
schools (with 4-4-4 and 8-8-8 classes respectively), and 90% for the Model
02 schools (with 6-6-6 classes), based on 35 weekly teaching periods. The
unit building cost would amount to about IJS$130 per sq m (April 1982 cost),
which is within the unit cost for similar buildings in the region. The
overall use factor of each school's teach:ng facility, which would comprise:
(a) existing teaching spaces, rehabilitated or converted; and (b) new
facilities, mainly workshops and classroomas, is estimated at about 85%.
4.04      Contingency Allowances.  The contingency allowance of US$65.9 mil-
lion includes: (a) physical contingencies amounting to an average of 8.6% of
the base cost; and (b) price contingencies averaging 33% of the base cost
and physical contingencies (Annex 4 gives details). Price contingencies
were calculated on the basis of the implemnentation schedule agreed between
the Government and the Bank (Annex 5) witlh price increases at the following
annual percentage rates:

1986        8       6.0
4.05      Foreign Exchange Component.  The foreign exchange component has
been estimated at: (a) civil works 30%; (b) furniture 28%; (c) equipment
63%; (d) professional services 9%; (e) training 41% average; and (f) con-
sultant services 68% average. These percentages have been calculated on the
assumption that it is likely that contracts for civil works, furniture and
professional services would be awarded tc local contractors, manufacturers
and consulting firms and that most of the equipment contracts would be
awarded to overseas firms. Including cortingencies the foreign exchange
component is estimated at US$73.3 milliorn, or 34% of total project costs.



- 36 -
4.06      Customs Duties and Taxes.  The total customs duties and taxes are
estimated at US$27.9 million, or about 13% of the total project cost,
including contingencies. Thailand does not participate in any regional
arrangement that allows reduced import duties for specified import suppliers.
Financing
4.07      The financial plan provides for a loan of US$75.0 million, as
shown in Table 4.3:

project or 40% of total costs, net of taxes. The Government would finance
all local costs.

4.08      Recurrent Cost.  Full recurrent expenditures for project compo-
nents would commence in 1984, amounting to about Baht 188 million (US$8.2
million) per year. Annual incremental recurrent costs for 1984-1987 are
based on the completion of 120 schools ir. each of the preceding years.
Assuming that total recurrent expenditure for secondary education will grow
at 14% annually over the Fifth Plan period, incremental recurrent expendi-
tures generated by the project would account for 10% of the total estimated
recurrent expenditure for secondary education in 1987.
Implementation
4.09      Responsibility for implementing the project would rest with the
Under-Secretary of State for Education. Staff were appointed to the
Under-Secretary's office under the Multil?urpose (Fifth) Education Project
(Credit 913-TH) to provide support services and coordinate project implemen-
tation carried out by line units in the M.LOE. The staff in the Under-
Secretary's office responsible for support and coordination are called the
Central Procurement Unit. To assure the continuing good performance of the
TJnit, three man-years of expert services and two man-years of fellowship
training of local Unit staff have been included in the project. The Unit
would be responsible for coordinating the preparation of quarterly progress
reports to the Bank. The progress reports, which would initially be com-
piled by the subproject units, would show the implementation status of all
project components and ensuing implementation plans, including construction
schedules and cost estimates. The reports would also set out actual and
anticipated budget allocations for the project and for replacements and new
facilities and for housing at project schools (para. 4.07).
4.10      Project Management.  While the Central Procurement Unit would
assume responsibility for overall coordination, the Department of General
Education would be directly responsible for implementing the lower secondary
schools component of the project, and the Office of the Under-Secretary of
State for Education, the National Education Commission, and the National
Economic and Social Development Board would be responsible for implementing
their respective staff development programs under the planning and
management component.
4.11      The DGE architects would direct and assist a consulting firm of
engineers engaged to carry out surveys and prepare inventories of project
schools, and topographical surveys, and soil tests of the sites. The DGE
architects would supervise construction work at regular intervals and check
progress, and clerks of works would supervise construction daily. The
Govrnment would employ consultants for the survey of project schools under
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
4.12      Budgeting and Procurement. tNulti-year contracting is permitted by
the Government in special circumstances, and multi-year contracts are being
practiced for the Community Secondary Schools under the Fifth Education



- 38 -
Project, including transfers of budget funds. To facilitate project imple-
mentation the Government would allow the same practice to provide the pro-
posed Secondary Education Project with budget funds which would be adjusted
to price escalation.
State of Preparation
4.13      Physical implementation of the project would be executed in four
phases (see Annex 5). Phase I implementation is scheduled as follows: (a)
preliminary standard designs of workshops acceptable to the Bank have been
prepared by architects in the Department of General Educaton (DGE); (b)
working drawings and tender documents for the workshops as well as for
facilities to be rehabilitated or converted, dilapidated buildings to be
replaced, and for new buildings to be constructed in existing standard
designs are being prepared in the DGE's architectural office; (c) surveys
for about 200 project schools, began in April 1982, paid for with funds from
Loan 1271-TH. Based on these surveys, the DGE architects would complete
tender and contract documents for the 120 first phase schools. Tenders,
review of tenders and award of contracts for the first phase would be in
October 1982-January 1983, construction would start in February 1983, and be
completed in January 1984; (d) draft master equipment lists are completed;
(e) draft terms of reference for consultants have been prepared; (f) draft
plans for local and overseas training have been prepared.
4.14      Implementation Schedule.  The project would be implemented over
five years and three months following loan effectivenes, including twelve
months of guarantee period, with a completion date of December 31, 1986, and,
to allow for finalization of accounts and withdrawals, a Closing Date of
December 31, 1987. Following completion of the first phase, construction
for the second phase would start in February 1984, the third phase in
November 1984, and the fourth phase in January 1986, each covering a
construction period of 12 months. Each construction phase would include
about 120 schools.  Tenders and contract awards for supplementary furniture
and equipment (some 25% of the total) would be in January-April 1983, with
delivery and installation in existing buildings at the schools in late 1983/
early 1984. Procurement of remaining furniture and equipment would be in
phases with construction. The training elements of the project, studies,
evaluation and monitoring, and preparations for future projects would be
phased over three to four years, 1983 through 1986.
4.15      Schools and Sites.  The surveys of schools selected for inclusion
in the project include information on population and potentials for
development of the location, in addition to the technical information.
Detailed criteria for the selection of schools and sites are set out in
para. 3.03.
4.16      Maintenance.  School buildings in Thailand are reasonably well
maintained. Funds for maintenance of secondary school facilities are allo-
cated yearly by the Department of General Education. Minor repairs and



- 39 -
replacements are paid for by the school out of parents' voluntary contribu-
tions or school fees.
Procurement
4.17      Civil works and procurement of furniture and equipment would be
grouped to the extent practicable to increase competition in bidding. Civil
works contracts would amount to about US$165 million equivalent inclusive of
price escalation. Contracts for civil wDrks would be awarded on the basis
of local competitive bidding, but foreign contractors would be permitted to
participate. Thailand has well-developed building industries and foreign
firms not already established in Thailand are unlikely to bid due to the
relatively small bid packages (US$200,000-1,000,000), the mixture of altera-
tions and new works under the contracts, and the 480 scattered construction
sites. Local contractors have won all civil works contracts in past educa-
tion projects. Bidding would follow current government procurement proce-
dures acceptable to the Bank. Prior Bark review would be required on con-
tract awards above US$700,000 equivalent, for civil works, and it is expected
that about 20% of the number of contracts would be reviewed. Annex 6 lists
documents for civil works and those to be reviewed by the Bank.
4.18      Equipment packages of US$100,000 equivalent or more would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank guidelines. The total value of equipment which will go to ICB is about
US$18 million. In bid comparison, domestic manufacturers would be allowed a
preferential margin of 15% or the existing customs duty, whichever is the
lower, over the c.i.f. price of competLng imports. Equipment which cannot
be grouped to form packages of US$100,0J0 or more and furniture may be
awarded without prior Bank review on the basis of local competitive bidding
in accordance with current government procurement practices acceptable to
the Bank. Miscellaneous items of equipment, in packages not exceeding
US$50,000 equivalent, subject to an aggregate total not exceeding US$2.5 mil-
lion equivalent, could be purchased through local procurement procedures
satisfactory to the Bank. Books and journals with a total value of
US$726,000, would be procured through direct purchase after negotiations for
discount.
Disbursements
4.19      The proposed loan of US$75 million would be disbursed on the basis
of:
(a)  80% of the cost of construction and site development of
workshops;
(b) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of imported equipment, books and
journals, 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured
equipment, books and journals, and 65% of the cost of equipment,
books and journals procured locally; and
(c) 100% of the cost of. professional services, consultant services
and training.



- 40 -
4.20      All disbursements would be fully documented except disbursements
for civil works contracts not subject to the Bank's prior review and local
training, which would be made against a statement of expenditure, documenta-
tion of which would be retained by the Borrower and would be available for
inspection by Bank supervision missions. The statement of expenditure
procedure for civil works would be appropriate in view of: (a) the large
number (some 90 packages) of small contracts (para. 4.17) spread over the
whole country; and (b) the small amounts (US$30,000-70,000 equivalent) of
reimbursements per contract. The proposed disbursement schedule is shown
in Table 4.4.
4.21      Based upon experience of implementing previous Bank/IDA projects,
the MOE has satisfactory capacity to use the statement of expenditure pro-
cedure. The DGE architects (para. 4.11) would certify the completion of the
stages of construction.
Accounting
4.22      The MOE, NEC and NESDB would establish and maintain project-related
accounts and would furnish the Central Procurement Unit, which would be
responsible for the coordination of project implementation, with such
accounting information as may be required. These accounts would be opera-
tional from the start of project implementation. Such accounts would be
maintained in accordance with sound and generally recognized accounting
principles and practices satisfactory to the Bank to enable the Central
Procurement Unit to provide interim and annual financial statements reflect-
Ing the financial performance and position of the project. Such financial
statements would be the basis of annual auditing of expenditure incurred by
the MOE, NEC and NESDB with particular attention to expenditure reimbursed
against statements of expenditure. Auditing would be performed by indepen-
dent auditors appointed in consultation with, and acceptable to, the Bank.
Annual audits would be submitted to the Bank within six months after the end
of each fiscal year of the Government to provide adequate and timely infor-
mation for the supervision of loan disbursements and of the project in
general.

5. BENEFITS AND RISKS
5.01      The proposed project would improve access, quality, relevance
and efficiency in lower secondary education through the provision of improved
classroom facilities, workshops, equipment and materials and inservice
training of teachers and administrators and strengthen planning and management
through staff development.
Benefits
5.02      Under the Secondary School component, the schools would be able to
teach the diversified curriculum effectively through the provision of
improved classroom facilities, workshops and equipment and inservice training
for some 3,240 teachers in work education subjects. With greater attention
given to work education subjects, secondary education would prepare students
better for productive employment when they leave school. By focusing on the
smaller rural schools where better qualified teachers with better incentives
would be encouraged to teach, the project would improve equity and quality and
help arrest the drift of secondary students to the generally better-equipped
and better-staffed urban schools. By 1987 a target of about 335,000 students
would be served by the 480 schools involved in the project. With improved
teacher utilization by 1987, there would be annual recurrent expenditure
savings of US$3 million for the project schools and over US$17 million for all
lower secondary schools.
5.03      The project would strengthen the Government's overall institutional
development by improving the effectiveness of planning and management in the
MOE, NEC and NESDB. The provision for staff development involving about
1,430 personnel of the MOE, NEC and NESDB would strengthen the Government's
capacity for effective planning, appraisal, monitoring and evaluation of
sectoral and intersectoral projects and programs and advance the goal of
developing an integrated planning system within and between ministries. The
training of provincial staff in planning techniques would also strengthen
linkages between provincial planning units and central planning agencies.
Four of the Regional Education Offices would be provided with equipment and
materials and technical assistance for organizational and staff development to
improve their effectiveness in school supervision, inservice teacher training,
research, and production of local instructional materials. The improved
effectiveness of the REOs would be part of the overall strategy to improve the
quality, relevance and efficiency of lower secondary education.
Risks
5.04      The secondary school component may not be able to reverse the
drift of rural students to the urban schools or to attract better qualified
teachers to the rural schools, but the project's provision of improved
facilities, equipment, and instructional materials would provide teachers

and rural students a viable alternative to urban schools. Further, there
may be some difficulty in recruiting suffic:ient numbers of qualified staff
to teach work education subjects. In the short run this difficulty would be
overcome by inservice courses for general sibject teachers in the work
education subjects and part-time community teachers who would be recruited
as necessary and by improved efficiency in the use of teachers in classroom
teaching. In the long run it would be overcome by adjustments to the
teacher training system, for which the project would provide funds for a
study. An additional risk is that the implementation program, requiring 120
schools to be upgraded each year for four consecutive years, might strain
the manpower of the DGE, but this would be relieved by improved management
capacity through the project's planning and management staff development
program.
5.05      Despite these risks, which would be kept under review during imple-
mentation, the project is justified by its expected contributions to the
quality, relevance and efficiency of lower secondary education, widening
access to secondary education in deprived areas, and strengthening the
Government's planning and management capacity.
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED ANID RECOMIENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, the Governtaent and the Bank reached agreement
on the folLowing:
(a) criteria for the selection of lawer secondary schools requiring
upgrading of physical facilities (para. 3.03);
(b) finalized teacher utilization plans would be submitted to the
Bank by December 31, 1983 (para. 3.10);
(c) recommendations for teacher incentives would be submitted to
the Bank and appropriate measures taken thereafter (para. 3.11);
(d) plans for expanding NEC's responsibilities and for strengthening
the Division of Educational Planning would be submitted by the
Government to the Bank by January 31, 1983 (para. 3.13); and
(e) additional staff for the four REOs in Regions 3, 6, 7 and 11
would be appointed in accord with an agreed schedule (para. 3.16).



- 44 -
6.02      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project would con-
stitute a suitable basis for a loan of US$75 million equivalent to the
Government of Thailand for a term of 20 years, including a 5-year grace
period.
