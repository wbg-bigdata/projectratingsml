MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOt A PHARMACEUTICALS PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the People's Republic of China for US$127 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years
of grace, at the standard variatle interest rate. The Government would onlend
US$127 million equivalent of the proceeds to the three project companies at
105% of the Bank's standard variable interest rate with a repayment period of
15 yiars, including 5 years of grace. The commitment charges and foreign
exchange risk will be borne by the project entities.
2.        Background.  The Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturing industry
includes, besides farms and factories for traditional (herbal) medicine, about
840 factories producing western type pharmaceuticals. The subsector is one of
the fastest growing, with an 11% annual growth rate over the last five
years. Total output in 1986 amounted to Y 15.2 billion (US$4.1 billion), of
which western medicines accounted for Y 12.6 billion (US$3.4 billion) and
traditional Chinese medicines Y 2.6 billion (US$0.7 billion). Although
exports have been growing rapidly, Ciiina still has a negative balance of trade
in pharmaceuticals. In 1986, exports were valued at US$600 million and
imports cost US$1.0 billion. Improvements in life expectancy (leading to an
increase in the average age of the population), changes in disease patterns
and rising per capita incomes have necessitated an adjustment in the total
level of pharmaceutical production, as well as the supply pattern.
International standards of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) are seldom n.et in
Chinese production units and quality control measures are grossly inadequate,
contributing to low product quality on the domestic market (with an obvious
deleterious health impact) and inhibiting exports.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Chinese authorities are
developing a long-term plan for the pharmaceutical industry which involves,
inter alia, the introduction of industry-wide technological renovation of
pharmaceutical factories to meet international GMP standards and the
appropriate legislative and institutional framework to enforce these standards
for the domestic market. The Bank intends to act as a catalyst in this
process by assisting the Government in monitoring the implementation of the
first phase of this program, and by supporting a provincial quality control
center and a modest pilot program for upgrading a limited number of
pharmaceutical factories to GMP levels. The experience gained from these
demonstration projects would be used to prepare a second phase for the
introduction of GMP and associated activities on a much larger scale. This
may subsequently provide the basis for a second sector-wide Bank
pharmaceuticals project, possibly in FY90. Bank financing for the ZYPF, the
largest pharmaceuticals project undertaken in China, in addition to providing
China with the resources to acquire modern, GMP-based technology, would result
in material increases in exports from the pharmaceuticals sector and help to
meet the growing domestic demand for vitamin C. Bank support would also



- 2 -
strengthen te eInLtrprise's management and marketing capabilicies and provide
a model which could be replicated elsewhere. In view of the fact that
advanced Chinese technology will be used for Vitamin C production and that
China already possesses considerable experiente in marketing large quantities
of Vitamin C in export markets, the Chinese authorities prefer to execute the
project themselves rather than see4ing a joint venture partner.
4.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to assist
China in reaching its objectives in the pharmaceutical subsector of:
(a) expanding pharmaceutical production using modern technologies;
(b) improving the quality of pharmaceutical products and their manufacturing
practice; (c) modifying the supply pattern of drugs to match changing demand;
and (d) increasing the potential for export from the subsector.
5.        Pro ect Descri2tion.  The proposed project will consist of three
components (a) establishment of the Zhong Yuan Pharmaceuticals Factory
(ZYPF), which will be the largest pharmaceuticals project in China and which
will produce, inter alia, pharmaceutical and modified starches, dextrose
monohydrate and anhydrous dextrose (for infusion), sorbitol and Vitamin C;
(b) the provision of advanced technology analytical instruments required for
the Henan Provincial Pharmaceutical Quality Control Center (QCC); and
(c) upgrading operations to international GMP standards in two pharmaceutical
enterprises. Training of appropriate personnel in GMP will also be included
as part of this component. The proposed project will be carried out over five
years and proposed loan funds will orovide for: (a) equipment and materials;
(b) licensing, engineering and consultancy services; (c) project management
and commissioning; (d) consultancy services for the introduction of GMP; and
(e) overseas training of the enterprises' staff. The pollution control
measures and expected emission levels of the plants included in the proposed
project are acceptable to the Bank. The total cost of the proposed project is
estimated at US$213.0 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$130.0
million (61Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, together
with the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank group operations in China are
given in Schedule C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7096-CHA dated April 27, 1988, is being distributed
separately.
6.        Agreed Actions.  The government has agreed that it will (a) ensure
that import licenses for all equipment and materials required for the proposed
project will be granted on a timely basis; (b) enter into Subsidiary Lcan and
Project Implementation agreements with the Companies for the GMP component;
(c) cause the GMP companies to provide training programs to the Bank for
comment by June 30, 1989, and to carry out agreed training programs
thereafter; (d) cause the GMP companies, on completion of the basic design
work, to submit to the Bank detailed implementation schedules; (e) cause the
CMP companies to maintain at all times debt service coverage ratios of at
least 1.5, maintain at all times long-term debt equity ratios of not more than
60:S0 and maintain zurrent ratios of at least 1.3; and (f) submit for comment,
by December 31, 1990, an industry-wide program for the introduction of GMP
during the Eighth Five Year Plan (1991-95), and thereafter exchange views with



- 3 -
the Bank on changes in the GMP program. Henan Province has agreed that it
will: (a) implement the ZYPF component through the ZYPF Preparation Office
(PO) until ZYPF's establishment; (b) ensure that ZYPF will be established not
later than December 30, 1990; (c) ensure that the ZYPF PO will construct the
facilities and that ZYPF will operate the facilities in accotdance with
environmental star.dards satisfactory to the Bank, and prepare the plant safety
manual for hazardous materials and emergency procedures at least one year
prior to start-up; (d) ensure that ZYPF PO will, after major process contracts
are let, submit to the Bank a detailed implementation schedule; (e) furnish to
the Bank for comment, by June 30, 1989, a recruitment and training program for
ZYPF staff, including a marketing organization plan which will cause marketing
staff to be appointed one year prior to start-up, and an agreed training pro-
gram to be carried out; (f) ensure that ZYPF will maintain at all times a debt
service coverage ratio of at least 1.5 in any year, and a current ratio of at
least 1.25 in any year and will attain a debt-to-equity ratio of not more than
70 to 30 not later than 1994; and (g) enter into a transfer and operations
agreement with ZYPF upon its establishment. Conditions of loan effectiveness
would be: (a) signing of Subsidiary Loan and Project Implementation Agreements
between the government and the companies for the GMP component and
(b) approval of the Loan Agreement by China's State Council.
7.        Benefits.  The ZYPF component is estimated to have attractive
financial and economic rates of return (25% and 34% respectively); it is also
expected to increase significant,y the *ubsector's foreign exchange earnings
by exporting up to 38% of the factory's outeut. It would contribute to the
transfer of modern technology while simultaneously developing China's own
process for Vitamin C production. The demonstration effects from the
introduction of GMP would not only raise the quality of drugs destined for the
domestic market (thus having a beneficial impact on the popuilation's health)
but would lead to lower unit costs and higher capacity utilization throughout
the industry, as well as develop 'he potential for export of higher value-
added formulations. With the increase in life expectancy in Lr.ina, and the
resulting aging of the population, there is a conqiderable growth in demand
for diet supplements such as Vitamin C. The output of the ZYPF component
would help to meet this demand, and in general, the project would aid China's
efforts to .mprove drug quality and public health.
8.        Risks.  The possible risks, which are considered small, relate to
the need to:  (a) ensure effective marketing of prod-cts produced by ZYPF;
(b) avoid possible delays and cost overruns in ZYPF due to the complexity of
the proposed project; and (c) ensure efficient planning and implementation of
the procedures and training necessary to reach and maintain GMP in the
selected plants. Risks associated with (a) will be minimized by ensuring
that, while a foreign trade company will initially handle exports from the
project, a recruiting and training program for staff servicing both domestic
and export markets will be established well in advance of plant start-up;
risks associated with (b) will be minimized by ensuring that each major
production unit will be implemented as an integrated package for which an
individual contractor will assume sole responsibility. It should be noted
that the rate of retutrn is extremely robust, and remains satisfactory even
with significant increases in costs, shortfalls in expected revenues or
implementation delays. Risks associated with (c) wili be minimized by the



- 4 -
cozmitment of COC and SPAC to the objectives of the GMP program, and the
employment of experienced consultants who will participate in all phases of
the implementation of the GMP component. Implementation will be closely
monitored by the Bank to ensure that the CMP targets are met.
Recommendation
9.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.

la  As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the
SDR. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater
than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
