PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HALAYSIA
KELANTAN LAND SCHEMES REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1899-NA)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) reviews implementation of the
Kelantan Land Schemes Rehabilitation Project in Malaysia, for which Loan 1899-MA
in the amount of US$25.0 million was approved on August 26, 1980.  The loan
agreement was amended twice during implementation. First, on November 24, 1984
when the original loan closing date of June 30, 1987 was extended by one year to
June 30, 1988 following project reformulation in early 1984. Second, on July 31,
1986 when US$7.0 million was cancelled. An additional US$6.87 million of the
loan amount was canceled at the time of the last disbursement on January 4, 1988.
The PCR was prepared by the South Kelantan Development Authority
(KESEDAR), the implementing agency for the project since 1983, and the Preface,
Basic Data Sheet, Evaluation Summary and Overview were prepared by the former
Agriculture Operations Division,  Country Department II, Asia Region.   The
Overview is based, inter alia, on the PCR; the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 2845-
MA) dated July 25, 1980; the Loan Agreement dated December 1, 1980; the Bank's
supervision reports and project files; field visits to the project sites;
discussions with the Borrower's project staff and Bank staff associated with the
project; and findings of a Bank mission in May 1991 to update information on the
status of the project and KESEDAR.
The Asia Regional Office wishes to express its appreciation to KESEDAR
for having prepared the PCR and for providing information to Bank staff for the
Overview.
The Report was sent to the Government for comment on October 7, 1991;
no comments were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA
KELANTAN LAND SCHEMES REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1899-MA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Prolect Obiectives and Description
1.      The project was located wit'-.n the State of Kelantan, which in 1978 had
the lowest per capita income in Malaysia.  -- project aimed at increasing the
incomes and improving living conditions of 7,500 low-income households by
assisting 5,700 existing settlers on schemes managed by the Kelantan Darul Naim
Land Development and Rehabilitation Corporation (TAKDIR) to complete the
development of their holdings and by settling and assisting 1,800 new families
to develop landholdings. To achieve this objective, the project provided for
11,575 ha of rubber new planting, 2,915 ha of rubber replanting, and
rehabilitation of 5,709 ha of existing rubber; new planting and rehabilitation
of 1,620 ha of orchards; construction of 120 ha of fishponds; and demonstration
coconut intercropping with cocoa and coffee on 100 ha. About 1216 km of access
and farm roads, 3,850 settler houses, and scheme management and social
infrastructure facilities were also to be constructed.   For institutional
development, the project provided additional staffing, vehicles, equipment,
facilities, and technical assistance to TARDIR; and consultant services to the
Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority (RISDA) to strengthen its
extension services for rubber and to other Government agencies for a road
construction sector study and assistance in formulation, implementation,
monitoring and evaluation of nutrition/health programs. Project implementation
was to be by the State government agency, TAKDIR, while RISDA was to provide
grants to settlers for the rubber replanting program.  The project comprised
TAKDIR's development activities in 26 schemes over a six-year period (1980-1985).
Implementation Experience
2.      TARDIR proved to be a weak implementing agency, confirming the doubts
expressed by the February 1976 Bank pre-identification mission, which had
proposed that the Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority
(FELCRA) be the implementing agency.  TARDIR was also handicapped by a poor
project preparation report, which had been prepared by a consortium of
consultants selected by the Government- but reluctantly agreed to by the Bank,
which had ranked the consortium the lowest among interested consultants. A new
survey in 1982 revealed that 57% of registered settlers did not reside on the
schemes and only 20Z of the settlers had land titles. Topographic information
had been deficient and this had resulted in many plots being located on
excessively steep terrain.

3.      From  June 1,  1983,  TAKDIR was  dissolved  and  the  South  Kelantan
Development Authority (KESEDAR), an existing federal land developmenL agency, was
given full responsibility for implementing the project. In 1984, the project was
reformulated and the Loan Agreement amended to provide for a changed approach to
rubber development from individual plantings to large scale block development by
contract, with settlers becoming responsible for maintenance and production after
loan repayment and sharing in the proceeds based on their allotted area of rubber
land  in  the  meantime.    Since  farmer  interest  in  fruit  tree  planting/
rehabilitation and fishpond construction had ceased after the termination of
Government subsidies, these components were dropped. Minor changes were also
made in the infrastructure component.
4.      KESEDAR faced serious problems on most schemes where a large proportion
of individual settlers continued to be neither eligible nor willing to
participate in scheme activities, frequently for political reasons.   Block
developments were much slower than anticipated, despite the Bank agreeing in late
1985 to planting oil palm when its outlook was more encouraging than that of
rubber.   RISDA was also allowed to incorporate rubber growers outside the
settlement schemes, but within the KESEDAR command area, under its mini-estate
and individual replanting and rehabilitation programs. Extremely low and late
budget releases in 1984 and 1985 when the economy was facing a downturn led not
only to slow progress, but also to development activities outside the most
favorable season, which has resulted in some low standard plantings. Moreover,
several contractors, who had been awarded contracts simply because of their low
bid prices and without a review of their experience and financial status, proved
financially and technically incapable of completing works in a timely manner.
Other unexpected problems were late releases of logged-over forest areas, the
presence of illegal settlers on proposed scheme areas, and security restrictions
in some areas in Kelantan which prevented access to a few project schemes. With
continuing slow project implementation, the Government decided in mid-1987 to
request early project termination, effective September 30, 1987. Final project
cost was less than half that expected at appraisal and reformulation, while the
disbursed Bank loan amount was only US$11.13 million or about 45% of the original
loan amount.
Results
5.      Overall, the project had significant achievements despite major problems
faced during implementation. At project termination in late 1987, about 21,800
ha of existing rubber was rehabilitated (382Z of appraisal and 232% of
reformulation target), about 9,000 ha of rubber and some 680 ha of oil palm
planted or replanted (66X of appraisal and 73% of reformulation target), and
additional land cleared and developed, which was planted by KESEDAR after 1987.
About 3,275 settler houses were constructed (85% of appraisal and 69% of
reformulation target), about 1,328 km of roads constructed or upgraded (1091 of
appraisal and 111% of reformulation target) and other settlement and agency
infrastructure provided. Though the project's achievement in the provision of
settlement and agency infrastructure (accounting for 60Z of final project costs)
was significant,  its productive impact was less impressive.   Planting and
replanting accounted for 81% of agricultural development costs but fell short of



- vii -
target and projected yields are not very high, particularly for individual
plantings (52% of planted and replanted area). At completion, the economic rate
of return (ERR) is estirAated at 22% compared with 17% at appraisal and 122 at
reformulation.    The  ERR  at  comp)etion  is  high  mainly  because  of  the
rehabilitation component, which acco"l  d for 69% of the area benefitted by the
project and substantially exceeded      -tC. Rehabilitetion, which consisted of
fertilization, weeding and ethrel stimulation of farms already in production, has
low costs and produces an early yield response. Excluding rehabilitation, the
project ERR is much lower but still reasonable at about 9%. The institutional
impact of the project was negligible.  Compared to the appraisal expectation of
1,800 new settler families, only 23 new families had been settled on KESEDAR
schemes as of May 1991, mainly due to slow settler selection by the State
Government. However, including existing settlers, the total of 7,344 was close
to the appraisal target of 7,500 beneficiary households.
Sustainabilitv
6.      Most of the project components are sustainable.  Both KESEDAR and RISDA,
which are now under the Ministry of Rural Development, are well established
agencies with adequate funding and are maintaining block plantings and settlement
infrastructure (KESEDAR) and mini-estates (RISDA). However, individual plantings
on most ex-TAKDIR schemes are less viable and the status of farms rehabilitated
by RISDA is unknown, since RISDA does not have a system of monitoring the impact
of its programs on smallholders.
Findings and Lessons Learned
7.      The main lessons emerging from this project are:
(a) The Bank should not have financed consultants for project
preparation it had evaluated as unsuitable, and should have
exercised better judgement in agreeing to the choice of the project
implementing agency (Overview, para. 34);
(b) Settlement policies relating to settler selection, loan eligibility,
land titling and investment levels per family, must be well
understood and evaluated at appraisal (Overview, para. 35);
(c) Schemes in which individual settlers are given land to be developed
largely on a self-help basis without a reas-.nable technical
knowledge of improved agricultural production methods and without
guidance from a good extension services are less likely to be
successful (Overview, para. 39);
(d) Untimely budget releases can adversely affect tree crop development,
which depends critically on optimum timing of operations (Overview,
para. 40); and
(e) Contract awards should be made to the lowest evaluated bidders,
taking due account of their experience and financial status
(Overview, para. 43).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA
KELANTAN XAND SCHEMES REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1899-MA)
Overview
A. Introduction
1.01      This Overview is based on the PCR for the above project prepared by the
South Kelantan Development Authority (KESEDAR). The PCR documents achievements,
implementation delays and problems in project execution. It, however, does not
calculate the ERR and the cost table is incomplete since it excludes expenditures
on a Road Sector Study, which was done under the aegis of the Economic Planning
Unit (EPU) in the Prime Minister's Department.  The Overview agrees with the
major observations in the PCR but elaborates on several specific aspects such as
production and benefits and implementation issues.
1.02      The project was executed during a period of rapid political and socio-
economic changes in the State of Kelantan, which had a substantial negative
effect or project execution and funding. The project had an early termination
in September 1987 at the request of the Government of Malaysia (GOM) due to
insufficient funding and slow progress.
Background
1.03      Some 37Z of Malaysia's population in 1978 had annual per capita incomes
of less than US$270, which was considered the income needed to provide acceptable
minimum levels of food, shelter, clothing and other basic needs. Furthermore,
two-thirds of those in poverty were to be found in the agricultural sector, in
particular, among households engaged in low-income, traditional activities in
rice and rubber smallholdings. The main objectives of GOM's agricultural policy
were:   (i) alleviation of rural poverty and redressal of interregional and
intergroup income disparities; (ii) increasing incomes in agriculture as rapidly
as possible; and (iii) generating employment opportunities for new entrants to
the rural labor force.
1.04      The State of Kelantan in 1978 had the lowest per capita income in the
country (about 38% of the national average). The population was overwhelmingly
Malay and rural.   Poor road and other  infrastructure had hindered  both
agricultural and industrial development.   In southern Kelantan,  the State
Government had commenced the development of 26 land settlement schemes, mostly
by self-help, but progress had been slow. The Government, therefore, requested
Bank assistance in completing scheme development.



-2-
Proiect Identification and Preparation
1.05      In 1975, the Kelantan State Land Development Board (LKTN) prepared a
proposal for the Third Malaysia Plan (1976-80) for rehabilitating and expanding
26 existing settlement schemes covering 76,000 acres, of which about half were
de-veloped.   A February 1976 Bank pre-identification mission considered the
proposal and recommended a detailed feasibility study. The mission also proposed
that the Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA), rather
than LKTN, be the implementing agency since the latter organization's management
and staffing was judged unsatisfactory.
1.06      In July  1976,  it was  agreed  that  consultants would  conduct  a
feasibility study for the project with the assistance of the Department of
Agriculture (DOA) Soil Survey Unit. In the meantime, some policy issues, such
as the level of investment per family and cost recovery as well as agency
responsibility (State or Federal) for project execution, would be addressed by
the EPU. Hiring a consultancy firm proved to be time-consuming and difficult.
The Government finally selected a consortium of firms, which was ranked lowest
by the Bank staff among contending firms.   After lengthy discussions and
correspondence over an eight and a half month period, the Bank reluctantly agreed
to fund the study with amended terms of reference &nd with changes in the
consultant team. The consultancy was to be financed under North Kelantan Rural
Development Project (Loan 1294-MA). The consultancy commenced in April 1978.
Draft reports were unsatisfactory and required substantial revision based on
comments by EPU and the Bank. A total of seven preparation and preappraisal
missions were required before project appraisal could take place in
September/October 1979. Several of the originally planned project components,
including most of the access roads to schemes and a substantial health and
nutrition component, were by then already included in the ongoing locally
financed projects.
Proiect Obiectives and Description
1.07      The principal objective of the project was to increase the incomes and
improve living conditions of 7,500 low-income ho"seholds in Kelantan by assisting
5,700 existing settlers on schemes managed by the Kelantan Darul Naim Land
Development and Rehabilitation Corporation (TAKDIR) to complete the development
of their holdings and to replant or rehabilitate their existing perennial crops;
and settling and assisting 1,800 low-income rural households to develop land
holdings on the schemes. The project was also to strengthen TARDIR, previously
known as LKTN, to enable it to provide adequate support directly to settlers and
to improve coordination with other state and federal agencies providing services
to settler households. The project comprised TAKDIR's development activities in
26 schemes over a six-year period (1980-85).
1.08      Agricultural development included 11,575 ha of rubber new plantings,
2,915 ha of rubber replanting, and rehabilitation of 5,709 ha of mature and
immature existing rubber; new planting of 405 ha and rehabilitation of 1,215 ha
of mixed fruit crops; pilot-scale planting of 100 ha of MAWA coconuts
interplanted with cocoa and coffee; and the construction of 120 ha of fishponds.



Infrastructure development included construction of about 3,850 settler houses;
basic infrastructure for scheme villages including 1 secondary and 8 primary
schools, 11 clinics, 24 community halls, and 8 gravity-fed water supply systems;
and about 136 km of village roads and 1,080 km of secondary field access roads
and  field  tracks.    Settlement  of  1,800  families  was  to  be  completed.
Institutional Development included assistance to TARDIR through additional
staffing, vehicles, equipment, facilities, and technical assistance; and
consultant services to the Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority
(RISDA) to strengthen its extension services for rubber, to the Implementation
Coordination Unit (ICU) for the formulation, implementation and evaluation of the
National Applied Food and Nutrition Program, and to EPU to undertake a road
construction sector study.
1.09      Organizationally, overall responsibility for project implementation
rested with the State of Kelantan. tInder the direction of the State, TAKDIR was
to be responsible for overall coordination of project activities; overall scheme
management; construction and maintenance of scheme roads, offices and facilities;
provision of settler credit; maintenance of settler accounts; and procurement of
equipment and materials.   Settlers replanting rubber were to receive grant
assistance from RISDA under the existing system. Settlers not qualifying for
RISDA grants were to be provided credit by TAKDIR.  The Department of Agriculture
(DOA) was to supervise annual crop, fruit tree and MAWA coconut intercropping
pilot scheme activities and provide materials and inputs.  The Department of
Public Works (DPW) was to second engineering staff to TAKDIR and construct
schools, clinics and water supplies. The Department of Fisheries (DOF) was to
second staff and provide facilities and extension services for fishpond
activities by scheme participants.
B. Project Implementation
Overview of Progress
1.10      Although TAKDIR lacked satisfactory managerial, implementation and
coordinating capacity during the early project period, it made reasonably good
progress with staff recruitment and training. RISDA and DOA appointed most of
the required staff and initial project progress under these agencies was
satisfactory. Rubber planting progressed slowly, however, since it was found
that scheme surveys were frequently inaccurate and TARDIR's nurseries were unable
to deliver planting materials in a timely manner. Some new plantings were made
on excessively steep terrain which precluded satisfactory terracing and erosion
prevention. Most of the first 120 miles of farm roads within schemes were not
properly aligned and many were on steep gradients without adequate drainage.
Much of the latter was due to the delayed appointment of the required roads
engineer. RISDA replanting and rehabilitation operations slowed significantly
since many settlers were found to be ineligible for grants as they lacked clear
land titles. There was an initial good response to new orchard plantings and
fishpond construction, while a limited number of coconut intercropping



-4-
demonstrations were established with cocoa and coffee. Budget releases by both
Federal and State Government were less than half of requirements and TAKDIR was
forced to utilize overdraft facilities.
1.11      Throughout 1981 and 1982 Bank supervision missions urged TAKDIR to
resurvey the settlement schemes to establish settler eligibility for grants,
their residency within schemes, land availability for new development, and
acreage requiring replanting and rehabilitation. Data was finally available in
late 1982 and it showed that 57% of tegistered settlers did not reside within the
settlements; only about 20X of the settlers were officially registered; the
topographical information had been inadequate which resulted in many plots being
located on excessively steep terrain; and that about half the houses built before
project implementation were located outside the designated settlement areas,
mostly within farm and reserve areas. In mid- 1982 it was decided that TAKDIR,
the executing agency, was to be abolished since the new State Government was
unable to bear this agency's operating costs.   At the end of 1982, serious
implementation delays were obvious with only about a third of appraisal targets
reached for rubber new planting, rehabilitation and replanting, while RISDA's
budget for 1983 was adequate for only about 252 of the targeted rehabilitation
program. Disbursement for housing loans was 41% of the project target and fish
pond development had reached 38% of its target.   Orchard development and
coconut/cocoa trial establishment had slowed. Actual disbursement of the Bank
loan as of December 31, 1982 was US$2.4 million or 34% of the appraisal target.
It was then agreed with GOM that, following the announcement of the new
implementing agency, a detailed review and rescheduling of operational plans
would be undertaken by July 1983.
1.12      The existing federal land development agency KESEDAR was given full
responsibility for the project, effective June 1, 1983. Project operations were
to continue through a newly established Rehabilitation Division within KESEDAR,
which absorbed more than half of TAKDIR's management and field staff (150 out of
255). A revised project implementation schedule, budget proposals and staffing
plans were prepared for Government and Bank review. Actual budget allocations
for 1983 and proposals for 1984 and 1985 under the Fourth Malaysia Plan (1981-85)
were far short of requirements established at appraisal. This necessitated a
review of priorities and a revision of targets as well as the project
implementation time frame. A Bank mission assisted the Malaysian Government with
project reformulation in March 1984. Original and revised project components,
development targets, and achievements are summarized in Annex 1, Table 1.  The
Loan Agreement was amended on November 24, 1984.  The Loan closing date was
extended by one year to June 30, 1988.  The economic rate of return (ERR) of the
reformulated project was estimated at 12% compared with 17% at appraisal.  The
major project  changes were:   KESEDAR,  a federal agency,  became  the new
implementing body (which made the Project Agreement between the Bank and the
State of Kelantan redundant);  the area of rubber to be rehabilitated was
substantially increased, the area of rubber to be replanted was reduced, and
KESEDAR was allowed new planting of rubber in settlement blocks rather than on
an individual basis (to facilitate improved standards of development, planting
and maintenance); and DOA activities in orchard and fishpond development were
discontinued.   Only minor changes were made in the settlement and agency



-5-
infrastructure  development  component.    It was  expected  that  KESEDAR,  an
experienced land development agency under a dynamic management, would be able to
complete the revised project works in a satisfactory manner, particularly since
the federal Treasury had agreed to provide the required budgetary resources.
1.13      Unfortunately, the high expectations from KESEDAR did not materialize.
There were top management changes at KESEDAR and budget allocations under the
Fifth Malaysia Plan (1986-90) remained far below requirements due to a downturn
in the economy and to some extent due to a lack of confidence in KESEDAR's
ability to complete project works through its newly established Rehabilitation
Division. KESEDAR itself continued to give greater priority in internal budget
allocations to its original Development Division, although the concept of block
development on remaining ex-TAKDIR schemes was proposed by the agency and fully
accepted. Dealing with existing smallholders on settlements and their problems,
many of them political, proved to be difficult for KESEDAR.   In addition,
unseasonal rainfall which delayed burning of felled forest lands, poor
performance of some contractors who proved financially and technically incapable
of completing works, delayed access to ex-forestry land, and security and
wildlife problems, made progress in the years following Teformulation extremely
slow, with only a few schemes progressing well. In late 1985, the Bank agreed
to finance oil palm development, since the outlook for palm oil was at that time
significantly better than that for rubber (Amendment to Loan Agreement dated
January 7,  1986).   Due  to slow progress with land development  and  road
construction, inclusion of farm roads in block development contracts, reduced
need for funds allocated for settler houses and consultancy services, and
increased funding requirements for RISDA's rubber replanting (mini-estates) and
rehabilitation, there was a further amendment to the Loan Agreement on July 31,
1986, which reduced the Bank loan amount by US$7.0 million to US$18.0 million.
1.14      Continuing inadequate and late budget releases led to late contract
awards for land development in blocks. In addition, poor contractor performance,
late release of logged-over forest lands, the presence of illegal settlers on
proposed scheme areas, and security restrictions in some areas of Kelantan slowed
progress on most block developments and reduced the need for settlers' and
village infrastructure. Slow project implementation led to poor disbursements
and following a detailed review by a Bank mission in July 1987, it was agreed
that the project should be discontinued. GOM requested by telex of July 20, 1987
project termination effective September 30, 1987. The final disbursement was
made on January 4, 1988 and the undisbursed loan amount of US$6,866,181.76 was
then canceled.
Prolect Costs and Disbursements
1.15      Project costs are summarized in Annex 1, Table 2, and include costs for
the Road Sector Study, which are omitted in Appendix 14 of the PCR prepared by
KESEDAR. Project accounts unfortunately did not allow a separation of road and
village/social infrastructure costs.   Total costs are M$77.891  (US$32.816)
maillion or only 51.6Z and 46.82, respectively, of appraisal cost estimates. Tree
crop development costs by KESEDAR and RISDA amounted to M$26.8 million, which is
57.6% of appraisal costs.   Infrastructure costs (roads, settler housing and



- 6 -
village/social infrastructure) amounted to 27% of appraisal costs. Although the
appraisal targets for access and village roads were exceeded, farm roads (680 km)
were mostly included in land development contracts and thus excluded from
infrastructure costs.   Fewer settler houses  (69% of revised target) were
constructed due to non-eligibility of settlers (non-signing of Settler Agreement)
and delayed scheme development. Most of KESEDAR's agency and social facilities
were completed with the exception of staff houses (70% of target). Management
costs, which included procurement of limited numbers of vehicles and equipment,
greatly exceeded (by 162%) appraisal estimates.
1.16      Due to slow project execution, low budget allocations, and thus low
levels of expenditures, disbursements were extremely slow throughout project
implementation.   At project closing, US$11.13 million or only 44.5% of the
original loan amount was disbursed.
Tree Crop Development
1.17      The total area achieved for various tree crops by the end of 1987 as
compared to reformulated project targets is summarized in Table 1. The phasing
of tree crop development is shown at Annex 2, Table 1.

1.18      TARDIR's performance was unsatisfactory.   Before its dissolution,
TAKDIR had only achieved 352 of its new planting (individual) target. KESEDAR



-7-
was also initially slow and planted only 2,057 ha or 36Z of its program for block
planting agreed at reformulation, although some more land was cleared and
developed by the end of 1987. KESEDAR's block planting continued after project
termination and reached 4,161 ha by the end of 1990.   A further 559 ha is
expected to be planted in 1991 (Annex 2, Table 2). The problems faced by TARDIR
and KESEDAR in project implementation were detailed in paras. 10-14.
1.19      In contrast, the achievement of the RISDA component for rehabilitation
and replanting was substantially above target. The RISDA program, which up to
project reformulation was confined to TAKDIR schemes and had progressed very
slowly, was given a much broadened base at reformulation.   RISDA operations
within the geographical region allocated to KESEDAR were absorbed into the
project and, further, mini-estate development was included. These operations
were part of RISDA's ongoing national program and were largely free of the
constraints on TAKDIR/KESEDAR schemes. The RISDA component greatly helped loan
disbursement.
Orchard Planting and Rehabilitation
1.20      Existing  settlers  were  originally  eligible  for  planting  and
rehabilitation grants (fertilizers, planting material, agro-chemicals and tools)
for mixed orchard crops. While these grants were available, about 200 ha per
year were planted and about 50 ha/year rehabilitated. When these grants were no
longer available, settlers had little further interest in the DOA orchard
program. However, many settlers continued to plant fruit trees using their own
resources with many obtaining planting material from Thailand.
Fishponds
1.21      The establishment of fishponds near streams proved popular on several
schemes during early project years, when some 66 ha were established. Hcwever,
when the subsidy scheme was terminated in 1984, interest in the program ceased
and no further development under this component was, therefore, included at
reformulation.
Hybrid Coconut/Intercrop Trials
1.22      Some 100 ha were to be planted on five sites to test crop suitability
and attractiveness to settlers.  Only in 1982 some 51 ha were planted, with
coconuts performing reasonably well but cocoa suffering from considerable pest
and disease problems. Continuation of this program after project reformulation
was, therefore, not considered.
Infrastructure
1.23      The component aimed at improving access to the existing and new
settlement schemes as well as to provide settlers adequate access to plots within
the schemes and to provide housing and other facilities for both staff and
settlers.    Implementation  of  the  roads  component was  uneven,  but  final
achievement was satisfactory. Delayed appointment of a project roads engineer



- 8 -
and the resulting poor alignment and drainage of many roads was of major concern
in early project years, and budget shortfalls prevented achievement of some
targets in later years. After reformulation, farm roads were included in the
land development contracts.   These crude roads require upgrading after a
settling-in period. Housing construction targets could not be achieved since
several schemes either commenced land clearing operations close to project
termination or were deferred. Achievements are summarized in Annex 1, Table 1
and in Appendix 7 of the PCR.
Studies and Consultancies
1.24      The Road Construction Sector Study was expected to take about 9 months
for the first phase, commencing in 1980, while a second phase was expected to
require  a further 6 months.   The  first phase  study was  completed with
considerable delay and at a cost close to that anticipated for the entire study.
Due to deficiencies in the first phase study, the second phase was not undertaken
(see further para. 37). Another consultancy, which established an accounting
system in TAKDIR and trained staff in accountancy procedures, was successfully
completed. The consultancies for RISDA and ICU (para. 8) were not considered
necessary and were dropped.
C. Prolect Impact
Overall Impact
1.25      Overall,  the project had  significant  achievements  despite major
problems faced during implementation. At project termination in late 1987, about
21,800 ha of existing rubber was rehabilitated (382Z of appraisal and 232% of
reformulation target), about 9,000 ha of rubber and some 680 ha of oil palm
planted or replanted (66% of appraisal and 73% of reformulation target), and
additional land cleared and developed, which was planted after 1987 (para. 18).
About 3,275 settler houses were constructed (85% of appraisal and 692 of
reformulation target), about 1,328 km of roads constructed or upgraded (109Z of
appraisal and 111% of reformulation target) and other settlement and agency
infrastructure provided. Though the project's achievement in the provision of
settlement and agency infrastructure (accounting for 60% of final project costs)
was significant,  its productive impact was less impressive.   Planting and
replanting accounted for 81% of agricultural development costs but fell short of
target and projected yields are not very high, particularly for individual
plantings (52% of planted and replanted area). Though rehabilitation, accounting
for 12% of agricultural development costs, substantially exceeded targets, it
consisted only of fertilization, weeding and ethrel stimulation of areas already
in production. The institutional impact of the project was negligible.

Oualitv of Tree Croy Development
1.26      The overall quality of rubber development is variable.  Generally the
standards of ex-TAKDIR schemes are unsatisfactory. Vigor of tree growth is very
variable; there are many incomplete tree stands due to planting losses; and
weeding has not been satisfactory resulting in lalang infestation in many cases.
Quality of plantings in the KESEDAR block schemes is higher and field maintenance
after planting is usually satisfactory. Factors most frequently contributing to
unsatisfactory tree crop performance in TAKDIR/KESEDAR schemes were:   poor
scheduling of land development in relation to optimal seasonal planting
conditions, inadequate nursery operations, poor quality rubber planting material,
poor post-planting field maintenance, and poor contractor performance.
(a) Land Development Schedules: Late scheduling of land development,
particularly for block planting and nursery sites, was frequent
and yet its adverse impact was inadequately recognized.
Administrative problems and procedures seemed to rule continually
against a better scheduling performance. Typically, contracts
were arranged too late in the season, often to coincide with late
budget releases, and thus land could not be ready for planting at
the optimum time. Planting even proceeded into the non-planting
months to satisfy administrative goals without due concern for
the inevitable high planting losses.
(b)  Nursery Operations:   Technically, these were very weak.  Poor
TAKDIR planning often left farmers without a supply of planting
materials in the planting season. In KESEDAR, poor scheduling of
nursery works often resulted in inadequately grown planting
materials. There were also examples of inappropriate sitings of
nurseries (poor soils, lack of water), inadequate monitoring of
supplies and quality of rubber seeds for stocks resulting in low
germination levels and large numbers of poor quality plants for
budgrafting, and poor contractor performance in budgrafting,
which affected planting material quality and its timely
availability.   Mention should be made, however, of the good
standard of rubber and oil palm nursery production schieved at
KESEDAR's Paloh 4 scheme under capable and experienced
management. Seedling vigor and nursery conditions there were up
to the standard of better private estates.
(c)  TvRe of Planting Material:   The successful use of bare-rooted
budded stumps, the standard rubber material of the project,
depends on vigorous materials planted early in the planting
season so as to benefit from adequate rainfall during early
establishment.   The project dependence on stumps thus became
risky where scheme management was weak and uneven plantings are
not uncommon in the project area. One particularly inappropriate
course of action by TAKDIR in 1982 in the face of planting
material shortages was to allow individuals to plant seed and
later budgraft it: most settlers were not trained budgrafters



- 10 -
and could not be guided against using poor clones or even growing
unbudgrafted seedlings.
(d) Field Maintenance: Whereas standards are generally good in the
centrally managed KESEDAR block schemes, those of ex-TAKDIR
schemes are much less satisfactory. High field variability was
inevitable in TAKDIR schemes under their largely self-help
arrangements and lack of good extension and management guidance.
In contrast, KESEDAR's rehabilitation service has vigorously
tried to increase the interest of settlers in their schemes and
overall field conditions.
(e)  Contractor Performance:    Inadequate  evaluation  of  financial
resources and past field performance of contractors often led
both TAXDIR and KESEDAR to appoint poorly qualified contractors
for land and nursery development, thus compounding their problems
and contributing to implementation slippage (see further para.
43).
1.27      Oil palm development, included in the project from 1986, is limited to
three of KESEDAR's seven block schemes. Standards of planting achieved to date,
both in nursery and field, are satisfactory. The program, however, fell behind
schedule when orders for planting materials were not placed in a timely manner
and KESEDAR had to forego purchases on the open market when prices soared. As
in some rubber block schemes, land preparation contracts were not appropriately
phased to ensure planting at the optimum time.
CroD Production
1.28      The yield profiles used for the project economic analysis are given in
Annex 2, Table 3.   They have been constructed  from PCR data and other
information, and reflect the difficult management conditions in Kelantan. The
profiles given in KESEDAR's PCR for block plantings of rubber and oil palm are
too optimistic considering field conditions and management constraints in the
schemes. Yield profiles for RISDA's rubber rehabilitation and mini-estates have
been estimated (individual replanting under RISDA is assumed to have the same
profile as that of TAKDIR/KESEDAR). The profile for rehabilitation assumes a
slightly inferior performance compared to KESEDAR's individual replanting as
rehabilitation is already indicative of below average teclmology and management
standards.   The year of first production in the rubber profiles for block
planting and mini-estate has been assumed to be 6 and that for individual
plantings 8 years after planting to reflect the effects of different levels of
technology and management inputs. While most of the area under individual rubber
planting and replanting is now under production, only oil palm in part of
KESEDAR's block planting at Meranto and Paloh 4 schemes was in production as of
May 1991.  During the peak period in 1993/94, the incremental production of
rubber is expected to reach some 26,000 tons annually from 31,400 ha planted or
rehabilitated until the end of 1987.  Of this, about 15,000-16,000 tons are
expected from 21,785 ha of rehabilitated farms and the rest from planted and
replanted farms. The incremental oil palm output is anticipated to peak at about



- 11 -
14,300 tons of fresh fruit bunches (ffb) in 1997 from 680 ha established by the
end of 1987.
Settler Incomes
1.29      Settlers on the original TAKDIR schemes were provided with 3.2 ha of
land,  of which 2.4 ha was  for rubber  and 0.8 ha  for orchards.   After
reformulation, KESEDAR planted rubber and oil palm on contiguous blocks of virgin
unalienated land, mostly on the fringes of original settlement schemes and on a
few new schemes such as Paloh 4. The settlers on this new land are expected to
receive individual title to the land, once clear policies have been decided by
GOM. At appraisal, it was expected that as a result of the project, the project
households would be taken out of the poverty group since family incomes were
expected to increase to two to three times their pre-project levels. There were
no systematic survey data during project implementation.   However, KESEDAR
conducted in Tune 1988 a soclo-economic survey which covered 1,135 settlers in
24 schemes. Results from this survey relating to production and settler family
incomes should be interpreted with caution since in mid 1.988 latex production was
above average for the year and farmgate rubber prices were high. Moreover, the
survey results do not reflect project outcome since it is unlikely that any
project planted or replanted rubber farms would have been in production in mid-
1988.  The average rubber yield was 92 kg/ha/month or about 1,100 kg/ha/year
which is slightly above the smallholder average of 900-1,000 kg/ha/year but
substantially below that achieved on estates (about 1,350 kg/ha/year). Settler
incomes averaged M$842/month, of which 57.4% was from rubber and 382 from off-
farm sources and the remainder (4.5%) from other farm resources (fruit,
vegetables, chickens, fish, etc.). The June 1988 level of family income was more
than double the rural household poverty level income of M$325/month. It also
compared very favorably with the 1978 family income level on the settlement
schemes (average of M$97/month), 65% of which was obtained from farm sources,
predominantly rubber. No data is available for the project planted or replanted
rubber farms, but it is likely that settlers on producing rubber farms have now
better incomes and living conditions (access to Kota Bharu and other towns, water
supplies, schools and other community facilities) than before project
implementation.    It  should  be mentioned  that  compared  to  the  appraisal
expectation of 1,800 new settler families, only 23 new families had been settled
in KESEDAR block schemes as of May 1991, mainly due to slow settler selection by
the State Government. However, including the existing settlers, the total of
7,344 was close to the appraisal target of 7,500.
Economic Rate of Return
1.30      At completion, the project ERR is estimated at 22% compared to 172 at
appraisal and 12% at reformulation. The ERR is calculated in 1990 constant terms
using the World Bank price projections of December 1990.  Project costs were
converted to 1990 constant terms using the Malaysian consumer price index. Only
rubber was included in ERR calculations since oil palm was negligible until
project termination at the end of 1987.   The calculation excludes costs of
orchards, fishponds and coconut trials; road construction sector study;
village/social infrastructure, as at appraisal; and 50% of the costs of



- 12 -
management facilities, since they also cover non-project areas. As at appraisal,
full costs of settler houses and farm and access roads were included.   Crop
development and production costs are based on estimates as shown in Annex 2,
Table  4.   The ERR at  completion  is much higher  than at  appraisal  and
reformulation mainly because of the rehabilitation component, which accounted for
69Z of the area benefitted by the project and exceeded the appraisal target by
382Z and reformulation target by 232% (para. 25). Incremental rehabilitation
costs are low since clearing and other establishment costs are avoided and a
yield response starto the first year after treatment. Excluding rehabilitation,
the project ERR at completion is much lower but still reasonable at about 9Z.
Sustainability
1.31      Most of the project components are sustainable,  including block
plantings by KESEDAR, RISDA mini-estates and settlement infrastructure, since
both KESEDAR and RISDA, now under the Ministry of Rural Development, are well
estab.ished agencies with adequate funding. In particular, significant favorable
organizational changes occurred at KESEDAR in 1990 with the abolition of the
Rehabilitation Division and integration of the project schemes with KESEDAR's
other schemes. Now all KESEDAR schemes are being managed by two zonal offices
in the north and south and the two zonal managers report directly to the General
Manager of KESEDAR. Compared to block and mini-estate plantings under KESEDAR
and RISDA, respectively, individual plantings on most ex-TARDIR schemes are less
viable. The status of farms rehabilitated by RISDA is also unknown, since RISDA
does not have a system of monitoring the impact of its programs on smallholders.
D. Borrower and Bank Performance
Government and Prolect Management Performance
1.32      The principal issue during project preparation was the selection by GOM
of a consultancy group that was inadequately experienced (the consortium ranked
fifth in evaluation by Bank staff). Before appraisal, the consultant's report
had to undergo many changes in response to the suggestions of EPU and Bank staff.
During the first two years of implementation, it was found that the feasibility
study was based on inaccurate statistics, particularly regarding settler presence
on the schemes, and many issues had been inadequately highlighted. Following the
change of State government, there was inadequate commitment to revitalize the
State implementing agency TAKDIR, which faced a multitude of political,
managerial, technical and social problems on the schemes. This in turn affected
progress with rubber, orchard, coconut/cacao planting, replanting and
rehabilitation, and the road construction program (see paras. 10-11 for details).
1.33      After the dissolution of TAKDIR, project implementation responsibility
was transferred to KESEDAR and a project reformulation took place in May 1984
(para. 12). A major beneficial aspect of the reformulation was that RISDA was
assigned greater involvement in replanting on mini-estates and in rehabilitating



- 13 -
older plantings after the settlers signed a Settlement Agreement (rather than
await land title).   However, project progress continued to be slow, due to
insufficient budget allocations and other problems (paras. 13-14).  Overall,
Government commitment to the project was variable but generally weak.
Bank Performance
1.34      The 1976 Bank pre-identification mission recommended that FELCRA,
rather than the State land development agency, be given the responsibility for
scheme completion and rehabilitation due to the latter's inadequate management,
staffing, funding and achievements (4,000 families settled on 38,000 acres in 16
years). However, this recommendation was not acceptable to the Kelantan State
Government.  The feasibility study financed by the Bank was to address major
issues such as land settlement strategy (individual self-help type of development
or managed scheme developed with settler participation as shareholders), the
level of investment per family, organizational responsibility and cost recovery.
Shortlisting and selecting consultants took months and significantly delayed
project preparation (paras. 6 and 32).  In retrospect, it was ill-advised to
allow Bank financing of a consultancy consortium which was ranked fifth in
evaluation by Bank staff.   The resulting study did not address the issues
adequately and the scheme statistics proved to be inaccurate or were wrongly
interpreted (para. 6).
1.35      The BtL,k appraisal team did not adequately evaluate the land title and
settler eligibility issue, which in many cases prevented settlers from scheme
participation. Settlement policies and requirements for scheme participation
should have been clearly outlined to prevent the difficulties experienced in this
project. In particular, the ineligibility of many settlers for grants and loans
due to lack of land title and their subsequent unwillingness to sign a Settler
Agreement slowed progress of new planting, rehabilitation and replanting, and
infrastructure development.
1.36      Since project progress continued to be slow, the July 1987 supervision
mission recommended early project termination which advice was readily accepted
by the Government. Bank supervisions were adequate and fully reported the many
problems encountered. Perseverance with the project, despite slow progress and
disbursements, was due to the expected change in Government commitment to the
reformulated project with project execution by a federal agency.   However,
KESEDAR was given inadequate budget and managerial capacity to achieve the
development targets for an underdeveloped and poor part of the State of Kelantan.
1.37      Bank guidance for the first phase of the Road Construction Sector Study
was insufficient. Mainly due to deficiencies in the terms of reference, the
consortium of consultants focusad mostly on organizational aspects. This proved
unacceptable to the Government and the follow-up study, which was to be more
focused on the analysis of the contracting industry, was not agreed to by the
Government and, therefore, not carried out.

E. Implementation Issues and Lessons Learned
Implementing Asencv Experience and Commitment
1.38      Identification of a capable project implementation agency is of
critical importance.   This was the major lesson learned from the project.
Although the Bank initially preferred FELCRA as the lead agency, it accepted
TAKDIR, an inadequately experienced State executing agency, for project
execution. With a change in State Government, this agency did not receive the
political and financial support it needed to u.pgrade its capacity and efficiency.
XESEDAR, which later assumed the responsibility for project implementation, had
difficulty coping with the task of scheme rehabilitation, particularly of schemes
with difficult politico-socio-economic conditions.   When inadequate federal
budget allocations necessitatod prioritizing tasks, the agency favored its
traditionally assigned tasks of new land development on schemes identified by its
own staff.   It was, therefore, appropriate that project reformulation had
focussed on new block plantings, rather than individual holding development. In
retrospect, all scheme rehabilitation work should have been assigned from the
beginning to specialized and experienced agencies.
Tree Crop Development Strategy
1.39      The input of settlers in individual holdings in TAKDIR-managed schemes
was generally insufficient and this led to the need for rehabilitation or
replanting.   Even after the necessary initial improvements were made, the
majority of settlers were not able to manage their properties adequately for a
variety of reasons such as insufficient technical knowledge, inadequate income
from the property necessitating off-farm employment, and non-residence on the
scheme.  In contrast, large block planting with adequate lay-out, terracing,
cover crop development, tree spacing and quality grafted planting material,
followed by a satisfactory standard of management (weeding, fertilizing, pruning,
etc.) during the long (6-7 years for rubber) non-productive stage and the tapping
of the trees using standard technology, has generally ensured reasonably high
rubber and oil palm yields. This form of development in Malaysia with settlers
sharing in the work and proceeds has proven substantially more successful than
individual tree crop management, which almost invariably has resulted in uneven
stands and poor maintenance, management and production standards. As in the
private sector, parastatal-sponsored development must have skilled and
experienced agricultural managers, but they were lacking both in TARDIR and in
KESEDAR's Rehabilitation Division.   Moreover, whereas good quality planting
material is essential to attaining high levels of future production, nursery
standards at TAKDIR and KESEDAR unfortunately were not always satisfactory. Of
the several land development approaches utilized in the project, the KESEDAR
block development with settlers working under central management until crop
development investments have been recovered, has the highest agricultural
potential. In contrast, the area under ex-TAKDIR schemes is not expected to do
better than average smallholdings.

Timinf of Budaet Releases
1.40      41Good tree crop development depends critically on optimum timing of
operations such as land clearing, land development, covercrop seeding, planting,
weeding, etc. and it is, therefore, imperative that budget releases are
appropriately matched to these seasons. When clearing and burning extends beyond
the dry season, it is not only much less effective, but more significantly,
delays planting beyond the optimum season and into the next dry season with
serious consequences. The award of land development contracts was consistently
late in the years 1985-87 and this delayed all planned development work. These
delays were in the first instance due to untimely budget releases. Future tree
crop development projects need to take due account of this lesson.
S^heme Lay-out Criteria
1.42      Undulating and hilly terrain with easily erodible soils requires
specific and careful planning to avoid erosion problems on terraces and along
internal roads. Existing schemes, which required substantial upgrading of farm
roads, had considerable problems of erosion due to inappropriate road alignment
and insufficient road-side drainage. These early problems were mostly avoided
in newly developed schemes when detailed design features for internal roads were
incorporated in development plans. There remain a few small areas in the project
with excessively steep slopes, but satisfactory stabilization measures have now
been taken, mostly through the successful establishment of covercrops between
rubber and oil palm.
Availability of Land
1.43      There were delays in releasing logged-over land by the Forestry
Department for new land development, and the non-availability of either land
title or Settler Agreement prevented KESEDAR and RISDA from expanding the area
of rehabilitated or replanted rubber in a timely manner. Despite an assurance
that the State of Kelantan would make land available for the proposed project
activities, thie was not always done. There were also problems of access to a
few project schemes due to security restrictions, which had been imposed in some
areas of Kelantan.
Contracting for Land Development
1.44      Contracts for scheme development (from clearing to planting, lay-out
of internal roads and initial crop maintenance) were frequently awarded to
bidders whose bid prices were well below agency estimates.   Many of these
contractors were not able to execute the work in a timely and satisfactory manner
due to undercapitalization and insufficient machinery and manpower.   Many
contractors were also awarded contracts during the wrong season (due to late
budget releases) with poor working conditions, whici caused unintentional delays.
Contracts should be awarded to the lowest evaluated bidders, taking due account
of their experience and financial status, and should be timed to make use of
optimal seasonal conditions, when necessary.

Summary of Lessons Learned
1.45      Lessons learned from this project are:
(a)  The Bank should not have  financed consultants  for project
preparation it had evaluated as unsuitable, and should have
exercised better judgment in agreeing to the choice of the
project implementing agency;
(b)  Settlement  policies  relating  to    settler  selection,  loan
eligibility, land titling and investment levels per family, must
be well understood and evaluated at appraisal;
(c)  Schemes  in which individual settlers are given land to be
developed largely on a self-help basis without a reasonable
technical knowledge of improved agricultural methods and without
guidance from a good extension service, are less likely to be
successful;
(d)  Untimely  budget  releases  can  adversely  affect  tree  crop
development, which depends critically on optimum timing of
operations; and
(e)  Contract awards should be made to the lowest evaluated bidders,
taking due account of their experience and financial status.

KELANTAN LAND SCHEMES REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1899 - MA)
1. INTRODUCTION
South Kelantan Development Authority (KESEDAR) was established
on 5th March, 1978 under the South Kelantan Development Act No.
203/1978. KESEDAR is a Federal Agency placed under the Ministry
of Land and Regional Development and it is the fourth Regional
Development Authority formed by the government after DARA (1971),
KEJORA (1972) and KETENGAR (1973).
Southern Kelantan Region is situated in the South of Kelantan
bordering Thailand in the North, Perak State in the West, Pahang
State,in the South and Terengganu State in the East. The total
acreage of Southern Kelantan Region is 1.24 million hectares
which comprises three-quarter (3/4) of the total size of
Kelantan. Southern Kelantan Region includes the whole of Ulu
Kelantan District, Jeli District and part of Tanah Merah District
i.e. Belimbing, Jedok and Ulu Kusial.
The majority of Southern Kelantan Region comprises of hilly and
steepland. Approximately 407. of the area is about 300 metres
above sea-level and only 25% of the area is found to be less
than 76 metres above sea-level. Nearly 50% of the area is found
to have steepness more than 25 degrees while only about 10% of
the area having less than 15 degrees steepness.
KESEDAR is empowered under the South Kelantan Development Act
No. 203/1978 to execute the following functions:-
(i) Develop, initiate, assist and execute the social and
economic development in the Southern Kelantan Region;
(ii) Develop, initiate, assist and execute the agricul-
tural, industrial, commercial and settlement develop-
ment in Southern Kelantan Region;



- 26
(iii) Control and co-ordinate the implementation activities
mentioned above in Southern Kelantan Region.
Though KESEDAR is a Federal Agency, it has to have a close commu-
nication with Kelantan State Government in its effort to develop
Southern Kelantan Region in particular and Kelantan State-in
general. KESEDAR slowly becomes the most significant concributor
to the development of the state of Kelantan. With this status,
KESEDAR was given the trust to take over TAKDIR with effect from
1st June, 1983. With the absorption of TAKDJR, it has become
the responsibility of KESEDAR to undertake all the responsibili-
ties that had been under the jurisdiction of TAKDIR especially
the Rehabilitation Programme which was started since 1980. KESEDAR
has formed a new division in order to be responsible for the
execution of the rehabilitation programmes left by the dissolved
agency (TAKDIR). This new division which was established from
1st June,  1983 is called the Rehabilitation Division of KESEDAR.
TAKDIR formerly known as Kelantan State Land Development Board
was established on 1st January, 1960 through the State Order No.
82/1959 under Section 30, Land Development Ordinance 1956 with
the aim of opening and developing land settlement schemes for
the low-income rural families who were either landless or had
very small holding,from among the citizens of Kelantan. The
concept of development is by self-help i.e. using settler's
labour (without pay) to the maximum and government aid to the
minimum. Every settler is given six acres of rubber lot, two
acre of orchard lot, two acres for padi (if there is suitable
area) and k acre for house lot.  All works involved such as land
development, house construction etc., were carried out by the
settlers themselves. Settlers were provided with some planting
materials but no other assistance. The 26 TAKDIR schemes based
on rubber are located in the districts of Kuala Krai (10),
Plachang (1), Tanah Merah (9) and Ulu Kelantan (6). These com-
prise a total gross area of 70.800 acres, (28,650 ha.) initially
planned for allocation among some 7,000 settle.rs. Develcpment of the
schemes.was very slow. Fourteen of the schem6e  were initial-ly
opened before 1965 and 9 between 1965 and 1970. Major factors



- 27 -
in this slow rate of development were the inaccessibility of
many of the schemes, particularly those opened after 1965 and
the lack of both assistance provided by TAKDIR to the settlerg
and the social infrastructure on the schemes. Limited assistance
was provided by other agricultural support services, for instance,
in development of small group processing centres (GPCS) for
rubber and other rubber extension services by RISDA, crop and
livestock extension by the Department of Agriculture (DOA) and
the Department of Veterinary Services (DVS) respectively. This
support has, however, been limited by accessibility, and lack of
resident population. The general lack of infrastructure reflects
TAKDIR's past financial constraints and earlier lack of support
from the Federal Government. In mid-1978 only four schemes could
be reached by all-weather roads, three had a piped water supply,
eight had primary schools, only one scheme had a secondary school
and six had clinics.  Lack of these facilities and other basic needs
caused     them leave the scheme periodically to earn a subsis-
tiance income, resulted in reluctance by settlers to construct
houses on the schemes and move in with families and contributed
significantly to the slow pace of the scheme development. A
survey of settlers resident on schemes carried out in 1978 indi-
cated average household cash incomes of $1,165.00 per year of
which about $755.00 was from farm sources predominantly rubber.
A survey of nutritional and health conditions on the schemes
indicated the presence of anemia and that protein/calorie-
malnutrition is common particularly among children. Malaria is
also endemic in these areas and intestinal parasites are common.
In order to speed up the rate of development of the schemes,
TAKDIR had to improve the accessibility to the schemes, provide
more assistance to the land development and also social infra-
structure on the schemes. However, TAKDIR had to solve its
financial constraints and the lack of support from the Federal
Government, before it could manage to carry this rehabilitation
programme which is known as Kelantan Land Schemes Rehabilitation
Project.

2. PROJECT FORMULATION
The Kelantan Land Schemes Rehabilitation Project is designed to
increase the income and improve the living conditions and well
being of 7,500 households in the State of Kelantan. It comprises
development activities in the Project Area for a period of six
years, 1980-85 and consists of the following:-
(i) Development through new planting, and rehabilitation
of about 37,200 acres of rubber, 4,000 acres of
orchards, 300 acres of fish ponds and 650 acres of
house lots by the State of Kelantan;
(ii) Development through replanting and new planting of
about 12,700 acres of rubber by RISDA;
(iii) Develooment of about 250 acres of hybrid coconuts/
inter-crop trial planting by appropriate agencies
concerned;
(iv) Construction of about 3,850 settler's houses,
eight primary and one secondary schools, 11 rural
clinics, 24 community centres, and eight water supply
Systems.all by the State of Kelantan;
(v) Settlement of about 1,800 families by the State of
Kelantan;
(vi) Assistance to TAKDIR management through additional
staffing, vehicles, equipment, facilities and
technical assistance by the State of Kelantan.
(vii) Technical assistance to RISDA to strengthen its
extension services and to the Borrower's Implementation
and Coordination Unit for development of a monitoring
system for Applied Food And Nutrition Programme (AFNP).
(viii) Technical assistance and consultant services to EPU
to undertake a study of the road construction sector
in Malaysia.

The total project cost was estimated at M$150.89 million
(US$70.2 m) of which M$54.57 million (US$25 m) or 37% of the
total cost would be financed by the World Bank. The summary of
the cost-estimates is shown in Appendix I. The proposed Bank
Loan of US$25.0 m would finance the full foreign exchange cost
of the project exclusive of taxes and duties. Kelantan State
would provide M$7.31 million (US$3.4 m) or 5% of the total
project cost as grants to TAKDIR to cover management cost. The
Federal Government would provide M$39.3 million (US$18.3 m) or
26%of the total projecz cost to the State in the form of loans
for lending to settlers to finance development of rubber and
settler housing and M$38 million (US$17.7 m) or 25% of the
project cost in the form of grants for funding of infrastructure,
development of agricultural enterprises other than rubber, and
lcoal cost for the road construction sector study. RISDA would
provide M$12.3 million (US$5.7 m) or 8% of the project cost from
its own resources for rubber development. In addition project
beneficiaries would contribute non-cash inputs to the value of
M$19.6 million (US$9.1 m). The summary of the financing plan
is presented in Appendix 2.
The project was expected to be completed by December, 1985 and
the Loan Agreement Number 1899 - MA was with lWorld Bank signed
on 1st Decembqr, 1980. The'withdrawal Schedule of the proceed of
the Loan is shawn in Table 1.
3. REVIEW AND CHANGE IN SCOPE
TAKDIR was dissolved and absorbed into Kelantan Selatan Development
Authority with effect from 1st June, 1983. Thus, it has become
the responsibility of KESEDAR to continue with the rehabilitation
programme that had becn undertaken by TAKDIR since 1980.
The event of 1st June, 1983 in which TAKDIR was dissolved and
absorbed into KESEDAR has to a certain extent hindered the
implementation progress of the projects under the programme.

In the process of handing over;certain projects had to be slowed
down and payments were stopped. As a result, the progress of
the rehabilitation programmes achieved until then was below
expectation and KESEDAR realised that a review and change in
scope of the projects formulated previously should be carried
out immediately.
After several meetings and discussions between KESEDAR and several
World Bank   staffs, a New Amending Loan Agreement was signed on
24th November, 1984 between the Bank and the Government of
Malaysia in which KESEDAR had to undertake the responsibility
to increase the incomes and improve the living conditions and
well-being of 7,500 households in the State of Kelantan. The
project comprises development activities in the project area for
a period of eight years 1980-1987 and consists of the following:-
(i) New planting and rehabilitation of 11,060 hectares
(27,309 acres) of rubber, 895 hectares (2,210 acres)
of orchards, 60 hectares (24.3 acres) of fish ponds
and 500 hectares (1,235 acres) of house lots.
(ii) Construction of 4,720 settlers houses, 24 primary
schools, one secondary school, 11 rural clinics,
26 community centres, 17 water supply systems and
24 post offices.
(iii) Settlement of 4,500 families in the Project Area.
(iv) Assistance to KESEDAR's management through addi-
tional staffs, vehicles, equipment, facilities
and technical assistance including extension
services and implementation capacity.
(v) Construction of about 555 km. of new, access,
farm and village roads and upgrading of about
640 km. of access and farm roads.



- 32 -
(vi) Development of 51 hectares (126 acres) of hybrid
coconuts/intercrop trial planting.
(vii) Development through replanting and rehabilitatdon
of about 11,600 hectares (28,642 acres) of rubber
by RISDA.
(viii) Technical assistance to strengthen the borrower's
implementation and co-ordination unit for development
of a monitoring system for AFNP.
(ix) Technical assistance and consultants services to
EPU to undertake a study on the road construction
sector in Malaysia.
The summary of the project components of the above reformulated
project in comparison to the original project can be seen in
Appendix 3.
The revised estimated total project costs are M $169.8 million
(US $73.8 m) in which M $57.5 million (US $25 m) is the allocation
from the World Bank Loan. The detail of the Revised Project Costs
can be seen in Appendix 4.
The break up of loan allocation and percentage of expenditures
to be financed are as in Appendix 5.
The total World Bank allocation was reduced to M $41.4 million
(US $18 m) in early 1986 after KESEDAR's request for cancellation
of M $16 million (US $7 m) was agreed by the World Bank.
At Government request the loan account was closed on January
4, 1988 after disbursement of US $ 11.134 million and the
remaining loan Amount was cancelled (See para 6.2.)

4.  PHYSICAL IMPLEMENTATION
4.1. Agriculture Development
The achievement of the agriculture development programme
implemented by the agencies involved are as follows
4.1.1. New Planting By KESEDAR
The achievement of new planting programme falls very
much short of the target and its detailed progrees >
can be seen in Appendix 6. The new planting program is
carried but by 2 concept of development as below
a. Individual New Planting
During the first four years (1980-1983), a total
area of 4055 hectares of rubber was planted on
individual basis. In 1984 some policy changes were
made to accelerate the development progranune. Under
the new project scope a total of 5,345 hectares was
to be developed on individual basis. Total achievement
at the end of the project was 4,695 hectares of
rubber or 88% of target.
b. Block New Planting
An area of 5,710 hectares of new and additional
areas were to be developed on contract basis. The
areas developed on contract basis include development
of two new   hemes (i.e. Meranto and Paloh 4) and
additional areas adjacent to RPT Mengkebang, Chenulang,
Sungai Satan, Air Chanal and Ulu Bertam.
In 1985, an approval was obtained from the World
Bank to develop the new and additional areas with
oil palm wherever suitable. Due to the difficulty
in getting oil palm seeds inn 1986 the proposal to
plant oil palm for the suitable areas was postponed
to a later year. By December, 1987 a total of 2,057



- 34 -
hectares (36% of target) were planted under block
system of which 1,378 hectares and 679 hectares
were planted with rubber and oil palm respectively.
The achievement of New planting programme especially
the block falls very much short of target.
The delay in obtaining forest clearance, incapable
contractor, illegal settlers and security restrictions
form the bottle neck in developing the new and
additional areas. The resistance of some 'recognised
settlers to sign the settler agreement pose a
serious threat to the success of the individual rubber
new planting programme.
4.1.2.  Rubber Rehabititation And Replanting BY RISDA
Under the new project scope it has been identified that a
total of 9,396 hectares of rubber deserved rehabilitation
and 2,201 hectares need replanting in KESEDAR Rehabilitation
schemes. From the planned target, a total of 21,784 hectares
(232% of target) and 3,238.4 hectares (147% of target) have
been rehabilitated and replanted respectively. Most of the
replanted area is mini estate.
It is worth mentioning that this programme does not only
involve KESEDAR schemes but it also, include areas/villages
in the Kelantan Selatan region and ex-TAKDIR schemes Air
Belanga and Air Lanas which are rubber mini estate financed
under the loan.
4.1.3.   Orchard New Planting And Rehabilitation
By Department Of Agriculture
During the first four years (1980-1983) a total of 689
hectares of fruit trees were planted at an average cost
of M $1235.00/ha. and 207 hectares were rehabilitated, at
an average cost of M 't151/00/ha. through gevernment
subsidies (see Appendix 8).

Under the new revised project scope with affect from
1984, the Department of Agriculture no longer participate
directly in the programme. However the extension services was
still continued. This is due to the financial-constraint
confronted by the Department as the result of the economic
recession faced by the nation.
4.1.4. Fish Pond Development By The
Department Of Fisheries
Under the revised schedule, the development of fish ponds
were reduced from 110 hectares to 60 hectares. Dy December,
1987, total of 66 hectares of fish ponds (110% of target)
were completely developed at an average cost of M$14,826.00/ha.
4.2. Infrastructure And Social Services
The summary of the project components and their achievements are
as shown is Appendix 7.
The preparation of infrastructure and social services programmes
were based on the priority needs. Due to that, several projects
were implemented not according to the planning set up by the
World Bank. On top of that KESEDAR had to face budgetary problem
due to the economic recession faced by the country. The budget
request for the programme was cut and KESEDAR were given just a
minimum allocation to continue with the project. The progress
achieved in the preparation of infrastructure and social
services are as follows
i. Settlers Housing
The target for the programme was to built4720 settler's
houses but to date only 3275 houses had been built or 69%
of target.
The construction of settlers houses under the settlers housing
programmes was slow due to the refusal of some settlers to sign
the 'Settlers Agreement From' with KESEDAR and the delay in



- 36 -
the preparation of housir.g site at Ulu Bertam, Air
Chanal and Sungai Satan Schemes.
ii. Roads
Achievement for roads were gbod. A total of 158 km. of
access road to the scheme (316% of target) was built.
A total of 683.5 km. (150% of target) of farm road was
constructed. A tctal of 135.8 km. of village roads (272%
of target) had also been contructed. A total of 307.4 km
of form road and 44.2 km access roads had been upgraded.
iii. Social Inrfastructure
A total of 15 primary schools and 11 clinics ere cons-
tructed under the programme. The number was below the
target of the World Bank because the programme was based
on the needs of the settlers and the policy of the Ministry
concerned. Not even a secondary schools is built until today.
A total of 17 schemes are now with water supply system. The
schemes are also equipped with prayer houses (mosque and surau)
and now total of 12 mosque and 19 surau are constructed all
over the schemes. Village hall 'Balairayal is another basic
need for the rural community and to date a total of 20
village halls have already been constructed.
Postal agencies and police posts are still very few. So far
only two postal agencies and one police post have been
constructed and this is found to be far below the actual
requirement. The electricity supplies so far are found
in eighteen schemes.
iv. KESEDAR's Facilities
The construction of offices and staff houses had been
progressing well. To date a total of 30 units of offices
(100% of target) and 137 staff houses in the schemes (70%
of target) had been completed. The number of tractor
shelters is 14 units to date or 100% of target.

5. AGRICULTURE COST, PRODUCTION
AND SETTLER INCOME
5.1. Cost
The total agriculture project from 1980 to the end of
1987 is M $ 28.9 million. The detailed break down of
the cests can be seen in Appendix 8.
5.2. Production
5.2.1. Rubber
The Rubber yield estimates for the individual rubber
planting is as shown in appendix 9. Estimate are based
on an average yield of 1100 kg/ha. from 1988 sociO-
economic survery. This is much improve over the 1978
survey which show on average yield in unimproved areas
of only 599 kg/ha. In general rubber production in the
twent-four schemes have shown substantial increasing
trend.
For the rubber Block Planting Project, the rubber is
expected to come into tapping in 1992. In calculating
rubber production and estimated yield per hectates are as
illustrated in appendiot 11. It is expected that with the
proper control of field establishement and management the
higher rubber production will be obtained.
5.2.2. Oil Palm
A total of 1974 hectares of oil palm is expected to
be planted by end 1989 to finish the project area.
The oil palms will start to come under production in
1989. The estimates of yield and FFB proe-tion for
the project area are as illustrated in appendix 12 and
13. The FFB will be sold and processed at KESEDAR's
joint venture palm oil mill in Paloh 2.

5.3. Settler Income
A socio-economic survey of farmers in 24 schemes was
carried out by KESEDAR in Jun 1988, a period of high
farm-qate price for rubber. The number of farmers
responding to the questionnaire was 1136 in 20 schemes.
Information was collected on their rubber production
and income from rubber, orchard and other off-farm
resources. Results are summerised in Table 2.
Table 2 : Results of Socio-Economic Survey
Acreage Yield            Monthly Income (M$)
Kg/ha/month        Rubber   Orchard   Other    Total
Sources
92              483         47       321      842
The figure show that about 57% of total income come from
rubber, 6% orchard and 37% from other sources. Although
every farmer did not enjoy all three sources of income,
it is clear that income is much higher in 1988 compared
to the 1978 survey. At that time average amount household
income was M$ 1165 (M$ 97/month) which M$ 755.00 (M$ 63.00/
month) was from sources predominantly rubber.

6. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
6.1. Project Cost
The actual cost incurred by the project until the end
of physical year 1987 is indicated in Appendix 14.
Actual cost incurred up to 1987 ammounted to M$75.57
million a decrease of 53% below the appraisal astimate.
However physical implementation of the project is still
being carried at all schemes especially for the new block
system project such as Paloh 4, Meranto, Mengkebang,
Sungai. Satan, Ulu Bertam, Air Chanal and Chenulang.
Project and actual cost for the major components are
summarised in Table 3.

- 40 -
6.1.1.  Agriculture Development
Actual cost incurred under this category indicate
a decrease of 52% below the appraisal estimate.
This is due to the fact that several on-going
agriculture development programmes were facing
acute problem due to the presence of illegal
settlers, security restriction, economic recession
and delayed forest clearance by Forestry Department.
These factors contribute to the delay in the im-
plementation of the agriculture development and
thus made their achievement fall short of the
programme target.
6.1.2.  Housing And House Lot Develooment
Actual cost incurred under this category indicate
a decrease of 57% below the appraisal estimate.
This is due to the refusal of some settlers to
sign the "Settlers Agreement Form" with KESEDAR
and the delay in house construction due to delay
in the preparation of lay-out plans.
6.1.3.  M4anagement
Management cost also decrease 18% below appraisal
estimate due to the frozen of new staff intake and
delayed in promotion exercise.
6.1.4.  Roads, Villages Sites And Social Infrastructure
A cost decrease of 79% is indicated under this
programmes of expenditure below appraisal estimate.
This was due to the delay in the construction of
road, water supply and social infrastructure. The
delay in the above works with special reference
to the construction of road, water supply, clinics
and schools has resulted to inflation.

6.2.  Disbursement
A sum of US$ 25 million was provided by the World Bank to
finance the project (loan no. 1899 5MA). The loan took
effect after December 1, 1980 and closing date was June 30,
1988, or such later date as the bank shall establish.
The total World Bank allocation was reduced to US$ 18
million in early 1986 after KESEDAR's request for cancella-
tion of US$ 7 million was agreed by the World Bank.
Allocation and utilization of loan proceeds by category of
works is shown in Table 3. From the total amount of loan
provided only US$ 11,133,818.24 or 61.85% had been utilized
leaving a balance of US$ 6,866,181.76. The un utilized
balance was cancelled effective January 4, 1988.

7. STAFFING
7.1. Prior to the absorption into KESEDAR in 1983, TAKDIR was
a State statutory body run by the staff which were not pro-
fessionally qualified and che agency had operated under in-
adequate technical, managerial and financial facilities. At the
end of 1979, TAKDIR had a total staff of 157 which comprises of
the Director and Assistant Director, head office staff including
a Project Manager who is an agriculture diploma holder, an
Assistant Project Manager, an Agricultural Advisor (made avai-
lable under the Colombo Plan), an Account Officer (a diploma
holder), a Chief Clerk, a Settlement Officer (surveyor), and
two Religious Supervisors as well as a number of Clerks, Typists
and Drivers. There were 37 Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors,
25 Surveyors and various suppor.ing staffs including 58 labourers
were attached at the three regional office and the settlement
schemes.
7.2. With the involvement of the World Bank Loan to TAKDIR in
1980, the volume of work in rehabilitation programmes were
increased and so the number of staffs had to be increased. by
1983, TAKDIR was approved with 303 posts consisting of category
A, B, C and D.  Out of this total, only 270 posts or 89% had
been filled up.
7.3. When TAKDIR was dissolved some of the former staffs opted
for pension, a few left for other agency and the others opted
to stay with KESEDAR. Due to this, KESEDAR had to reorganise
the new division by injecting former KESEDAR's staff which were
more professionally qualified and experienced. At the end of
September, 1987 the division was approved with 333 posts which
is made up of category A, B, C and D. Out of this total, only
259 posts or 78% were filled up. This is as shown in Table 5
below:-

8. ISSUES AND LESSONS TO BE LEARNT
8.1.  Project Implementation
8.1.1. Implementation Strategy
8.1.1.1. When KESEDAR took over TAKDIR on
the 1st of June 1983, the Agency had no choice
but to continue implementing the projects that
was agreed upon by the World Bank. The overall
performance of the project was not satisfactory
especially on agricultural development and roads
and tracks services. All the projects were
expected to be completed by December, 1985 but
after revision the period was extended to
December 1987. The total project cost was
reduced from US$ 25 million to US$ 18 million
and later in early 1986 KESEDAB requested for
another cancelfation of $7 million to the World
Bank. To date, the actual loan withd,rawal was
,US$ 11,133,818.24 (as on 29.2.1988).



- 44 -
8.1.1.2. The overall performance of the project
to a certain extent was satisfactory. There was
no detaii soil feasibility study undertalcen by
any consultant and because of that soil errosion
took place in Chenulang Schcme which effect the
agriculture roads and terraces.
8.1.2.  Project imolementation Delay
8.1.2.1.  The completion of most contract works
were delaved. Among the major problem encountered
were slow release of forest lands, adverse weather
and soil condition, the illegal settlers, security
restriction, the failure of getting the settlers
to sign the "Settler Agreement Form" and the
economic recession.                              v
8.1.2.2. The contract works were mostly given to
Bumiputera contractors. They in turn gave sub-
constract to s.nall local contractors which have
not much experience in agricultural works. In
most cases they did not have enough capital to
rent machineries and hence, their inability to
complete the work on schedule. About half of
the contractors involved in the project were not
financially equipped and having little technical
capability and experience.
8.1.2.3. Most of the agriculture contracts were
given to the cheapest bidder although they were
below our estimate. Failure to select a good
contractor would affect the project implementation.
For example, the agriculture contracts given to
Maya Construction in Meranto, Huzaima and Everjoy
in the Sungai Satan Scheme and Seri Kerjaya iu Air
Chanal had to be terminated.



- 45 -
8.1.3.  Lesson Learned
8.1.3.1. Technical, social and economic sustain-
ability should be looked into very serious'ly in
project planning and design, and this should be
constantly revised during implementation.
8.1.3.2. Forest clearance, soil feasibility study,
the illegal settlers problem and the security
restriction should be cleared first before any
agriculture programme is implemented.  These fac-
tors would delay the projects if they are ncL
taken care of very seriously in the early planning
stage.

NOTE:      (i)   Based upon socio-economic results in 1988 the present average
yields at the level of 1100 hg/hectare/yr.
(ii)  The yield of rubber trees is highly correlated to the age of the
trees. The correlation is assumed to be:
