MOROCCO (“Borrower”) and INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT (“Bank”) for the purpose of providing financing in support of
the Program (as defined in the Appendix to this Agreement). The Bank has decided to
provide this financing on the basis, inter alia, of: (a) the actions which the Borrower has
already taken under the Program and which are described in Section I of Schedule 1 to
this Agreement; and (b) the Borrower’s maintenance of an appropriate macroeconomic
policy framework. The Borrower and the Bank therefore hereby agree as follows:

        time through a Currency Conversion in accordance with the provisions of Section

        interest payable by the Borrower during the Conversion Period on such amount
        shall be determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of Article IV of
        the General Conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amount of the
        Withdrawn Loan Balance remains unpaid when due and such non-payment
        continues for a period of thirty days, then the interest payable by the Borrower
        shall instead be calculated as provided in Section 3.02 (d) of the General

                Currency; and (ii) a change of the interest rate basis applicable to all or

2.      If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal
        Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on
        each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

        (a)     To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of
                the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the
                Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1
                of this Schedule.

        (b)     Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be
                repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such
                withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the
                amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is
                the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this
                Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”)
                and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original
                Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such
                date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any
                amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency
                Conversion applies.

3.      (a)     Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any
                Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the
                principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as
                withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date
                following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each
                Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment
                Date following the date of withdrawal.

     (b)    Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
            at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which
            invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the
            provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any
            withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.

4.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a
     Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an
     Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is
     repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion
     Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its
     currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the
     exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency
     payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the
     Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion
     Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5.   If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,
     the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated
     in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for
     each such amount.
