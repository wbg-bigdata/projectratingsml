H. Restructuring (if any)

N/A
1.      Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., Program Document/ISR,
not evaluative):

1.     The Bank has had a long and active dialogue with the Government of Morocco in
the education sector. Prior to this Development Policy Loan (DPL), the most recent
operation was the Basic Education Reform Support Project (Programme d’appui à la
réforme du secteur de l’éducation et de la formation – PARSEM, Ln. 7273), a sector-
wide approach (SWAp) operation that closed in 2009. While the present operation is the
first DPL in the human development sector in Morocco, it has a strong link with
PARSEM as it continues Bank support to the Government in the implementation of its
education reform agenda. In particular, the design is built on lessons learned from the
implementation of the SWAp as well as the results/report-based disbursement methods.

2.      The Education Development Policy Program (EDPP) was originally designed as a
series of two single-tranche DPLs to support essential policy measures and actions while
reinforcing results-based approaches. The First Education Development Policy Loan
(EDPL1), the subject of this ICR, aimed to support key initial institutional and regulatory
measures as well as the introduction of new approaches to improve service delivery
effectiveness and efficiency. Eight triggers for a Second Education Development Policy
Loan (EDPL2) were identified during the preparation phase with a goal of continuing to
support institutional reforms and scaling up the education program to address core cross-
cutting issues. Not all of the EDPL2 triggers were met within the period of 24 months
following the Board’s approval of EDPL1, so the two DPLs were “de-linked? as a series;
however, EDPL2 preparation continues, and the original objectives remain unchanged.

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector background, rationale
for Bank assistance)

3.      In 2010, at the time the EDPL1 operation was appraised, Morocco was
experiencing remarkable political, economic and social transformations. Sound
macroeconomic policies implemented during the previous decade led to a stable
macroeconomic environment, stronger public finances and a sound financial sector. An
adequate macroeconomic framework, together with a targeted stimulus package to help
the most affected sectors and populations, were instrumental in mitigating the impact of
the global economic crisis in the country.

4.      Economic growth and reduced unemployment rates were accompanied by a
significant reduction in absolute poverty. However, the benefits of growth were not
equally shared, and a quarter of the population still remained either in absolute poverty or
under constant threat of poverty.         In particular, the rural-urban gap reflected
unprecedented levels of inequality.




                                             1
5.      Research showed that inadequate qualifications and skills of graduates were
among the main factors hindering Morocco’s economic growth and long-term
competitiveness. Investing in human capital through quality education was, therefore,
identified as the second priority (following territorial integrity) in the country’s
development process.

6.       The main challenges faced by the education sector in Morocco were: (i) ensuring
comprehensive and equitable school access; (ii) decentralizing governance; (iii)
maintaining financial sustainability; (iv) enhancing education quality and system
efficiency; and (v) and improving learning achievement. To address these challenges, the
Government launched a comprehensive reform of the education and training system, with
the approval of the 1999 National Education and Training Charter (CNEF). A decade
later, the Government initiated an “Education Emergency Program? (EEP) for the period
2009-2012 to accelerate the implementation of reforms contained in the CNEF. The
fundamental guiding principle of the EEP was to place students at the heart of the
education and training system, providing them with competencies in an environment
conducive to learning.

7.      In this context, the EDPP was conceived to support the implementation of EEP. It
was one of the main vehicles contributing to the second pillar of the Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) 1 by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of education service
delivery and educational outcomes. In coordination with a group of seven Technical and
Financial Partners 2 (TFP), the EDPP aimed to support the Government in its efforts to
improve the accumulation of human capital through the implementation of policies and
measures designed to improve access, equity, educational outcomes and the effectiveness
and efficiency of the education system.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

8.    The original PDO of the EDPP (including EDPL1) was: to support the
implementation of the Government's "Education Emergency Program 2009-2012" to
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery and educational outcomes.

9.     The key performance indicators are: (i) primary net enrollment rate; (ii) secondary
net enrollment rate; and (iii) completion rate for grades 1-9. These indicators are
disaggregated for gender and urban/rural areas in Annex 7. In addition, the
EDPP/EDPL1 had a set of progress indicators, detailed in the Program Policy Matrix
(Section 2.1).

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

16.       Factors that positively contributed to implementation include:

      •    Strong Government ownership and support from the highest authorities in the
           country, including His Majesty King Mohammed VI;
      •    Alignment with EEP, as outlined in the Government’s Letter of Development
           Policy (Annex 1 of the Program Document);
      •    Links to PARSEM, including the incorporation of lessons learned, such as the
           importance of active communication channels given the large number of actors
           and the importance of supervision at the decentralized level; 11
      •    Debates and stakeholder participation during the preparation phase sparked by
           CSE’s education system performance evaluation 12 (April 2008);
      •    Collaborative supervision by the TFP group, which encouraged a more efficient
           use of time and resources during implementation;
      •    Harmonization of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) among the TFP group using
           a single policy matrix (detailed in section 2.3), within which the ten priority
           measures for the Bank-financed loan are included, noted by asterisks;
      •    Comprehensive programming of EEP´s implementation in terms of activities and
           resources, as supported by the MTEF results-based management methodology.

17.       Factors that negatively impacted implementation include:

      •    Since the EEP was system-wide, it was by nature complex and ambitious given
           the short three-year timeframe. The program included 27 major projects, 66
           themes and 160 different measures, largely unprioritized;
      •    Communication between the central administration and local levels 13 was not as
           regular or effective as was needed. Lack of attention to local contexts and
           realities on the ground sometimes hindered implementation of certain activities,
           e.g., expectations that Parents Associations would be highly active in certain
           geographic areas;
      •    Many activities were, by design, decentralized to local levels. The capacity at
           some of the AREFs and Provincial Education Offices was not fully in line with
           what was required of them to implement the program. For example, the lack of
           experience in procuring and supervising school construction and rehabilitation
           led to significant delays, and the lack of adequate information systems led to
           insufficient planning ability and monitoring at the local level;
      •    Some conflicts of interest and resistance to change were faced. For instance,
           some school level staff and administrators were not comfortable with their
           increased responsibilities, resulting in certain policy changes not being fully

        implemented (e.g., the school record booklets for tracking individual students).
        In addition, there were teacher union movements against certain measures,
        particularly new teacher redeployment efforts given the resulting change in their
        employment status (and therefore pension plan) from civil servant depending on
        the central government to AREF (local civil service) “employee;?
    •   There was a lack of capacity in certain areas (e.g., financial planning and
        budgeting) at the central level, exacerbated by the retirement of a large number
        of experienced staff. TFP technical assistance was sometimes insufficient to
        address such capacity weaknesses that came about during the implementation of
        the Government’s reform program;
    •   High level political leadership changes in Government and in the Constitution
        (2011) led, in the last year of implementation, to a lack of clarity and a
        consequent slowing down of activities;
    •   The limited capacity of the MOE to process only one out of five technical
        assistance (TA) contracts meant that implementation did not benefit from the
        expertise that the programmed TA activities would have provided. National
        procurement methods proved inefficient, highlighting the need for completing
        the programmed assistance to enhance public procurement capacities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

M&E Design:

18.     A common results framework, but complex and ambitious. The TFPs worked
together with the Government to develop a common Program Policy Matrix and common
monitoring and reporting arrangements. The matrix indicators were collaboratively
selected among those that were already being used to measure and evaluate the
Government’s education reform plan. The World Bank loan included ten prior actions
(identified by an asterisk in the Program Document Matrix). There is general consensus
among those involved in program implementation that the indicators were overly
ambitious and in some cases even unrealistic given the lack of capacity at local levels and
lack of capacity building support that would have been required. The results framework is
common to all TFPs, but each TFP had its own financing operation with prior actions and
triggers that differ slightly from one to another. Most of the indicators in the results
framework are quantitative (enrollment, completion, repetition, etc.) and few capture
more qualitative results. These types of indicators were chosen because of the short
timeframe for the reform program (three years) with the acknowledgement that it would
be overly ambitious to expect great gains in quality within such a short period of time.

19.    Monitoring agreements clarified roles and responsibilities. A non-binding
partnership framework and a memorandum of understanding were signed by the
Government and TFPs. The TFPs and the Government jointly developed an Operational
Manual to guide the implementation and monitoring of the program. These documents
were referred to frequently during implementation.




                                            12
20.    Advance planning for supervision successfully established expectations. The
dates for joint (Government/TFP) supervision missions were set in advance and
scheduled to occur semi-annually. A two-week mission was scheduled each year for the
month of May and a three-week mission was scheduled for the month of October. The
missions were collaboratively planned and included expert consultants in major areas of
the reform, including education policy, teacher training, school-based management,
education planning, and system monitoring and evaluation. Mission objectives always
included updating the progress of results indicators, monitoring implementation
performance, following up on previously agreed actions and making decisions
concerning TFP´s disbursements – particularly during the October missions.

21.     M&E Implementation: (the extent to which appropriate data was actually
collected using appropriate collection methods (to ensure data quality)

22.     Joint M&E during implementation was effective. One TFP would act as the
lead coordinating donor for a period of one year 14, then rotating to another TFP on a
volunteer basis. The lead donor facilitated communication with the government
counterparts and took the lead in organizing missions. Both the Government and TFPs
agreed this was an effective way to work and subsequently increased the frequency of
their communication to weekly meetings.

23.    The Government was proactive in monitoring its own program activities. The
Government undertook two major evaluations: an external mid-term technical audit
commissioned by the Central Administration Office of the MOE (done by KPMG) and an
assessment conducted by the “Inspection générale du Ministère,? both finalized in July
2012.

24.     M&E included a “results on the ground? focus. In addition to the MOE’s
regular data collection function, supervision missions always included field visits to take
note of issues and impact at the local level.

M&E Utilization:

25.    Data collected and produced by the DSSP and the DAGP are considered to
be largely reliable. For pre-school enrollment rates, the data collected are not fully
accurate due to the fact that the vast majority of pre-school activities take place outside
the purview of the MOE.

26.    Effective use of M&E data was observed. For example, the act of publishing
student assessment results was seen as a positive initiative, even though the levels of
achievement were poor. Publicizing the information sparked active nation-wide debate
about the poor quality of education and the need to improve it. On the other hand, the


14
   The French Development Agency (AFD) acted as the first lead coordinating donor and held the position for more
than two years.




                                                        13
activities related to individual student monitoring did not achieve the expected results,
partly due to the inadequate support to the local level and lack of a proper information
system for reporting. Another successful example of the effective use of data collected
came from the impact of the increased amount of boarding school “scholarships.? The
positive impact on enrollment and student retention were widely shared and used to make
the case for not only continuing the scholarship program but to justifying an increased
scholarship amount for future years.

27.     The “mid-term audit? was delivered too late to be used to improve
implementation during the second half of the program. The selected firm conducted
the audit timely, but delays experienced in the procurement process led to the report
being delivered in June 2012, instead of earlier during implementation. Data and
recommendations in the report could have helped improve performance in the second half
of the program. In September 2012, the Government issued an action plan to overcome
problems highlighted by the audit, particularly in terms of general organization, internal
controls and public procurement. This action plan is currently being considered as the
Government finalizes its Medium Term Development Plan 2013-2016.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

28.      The Government has launched the preparation of its Medium Term Development
Plan for the education sector for 2013-2016. The Plan includes five overarching strategic
pillars: access/opportunity, quality of teaching, schools, sector governance and human
resources capacity building and management. EPDL2 will focus on the same policy areas
and deepen the reform efforts.


3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

29.    Improving education in Morocco is a national priority and has in recent years
become a subject of national public debate. Remarkable efforts have been made by the
Government to pro-actively reach out to sector stakeholders, partners and beneficiaries to
encourage collaboration and cooperation. At the same time the Government continues its
high level of public financing of the sector and actively seeks ways to achieve greater
system efficiency and decentralization. These are highly consensual reforms and recent
progress and achievements are unlikely to be reversed.

30.    Relevance of objectives. The objectives of the EDPL1 were highly relevant to
Morocco because they aimed to support the implementation of the Government’s own
“Education Emergency Program 2009-2012? to improve the effectiveness and efficiency
of service delivery and educational outcomes. The 2009 Country Partnership Strategy
between the Government and the World Bank comprised three pillars: (i) encouraging
growth, competitiveness and employment; (ii) improving the quality of service delivery



                                            14
to citizens; and (iii) promoting sustainable development within the context of climate
change. The EDPL1 is part of the Bank’s support to pillar (ii) and, as such, aimed to
address the issue of quality education service delivery through: (i) improved management
of the sector by way of increased decentralization to, and accountability of, the AREFs
that are responsible for local service delivery; (ii) increased targeting as a means to reach
the most vulnerable and improve retention and reduce drop-out rates; and (iii) enhanced
accountability of education personnel by means of performance-based measures.

31.     Design. There is a shared recognition that a programmatic DPL series, used in a
number of sectors in Morocco, enables the Bank to support critical elements of the
Government’s reform agenda in a focused manner. The other donors and the
Government of Morocco chose the DPL as the appropriate lending tool for this operation.
The Bank played an important role in providing sector knowledge and experience,
strengthening cross-sectoral policy dialogue between various government entities
(especially linking sector development outcomes to the country’s overall economic
framework), and ensuring sustained commitment toward the effective reform of the
sector. The EDPL1 has helped accelerate implementation of the education reform
program by supporting key institutional and regulatory measures (such as the transfer of
teacher training colleges to universities) as well as the introduction of new approaches to
improving service delivery effectiveness and efficiency (such as the use of MTEF for the
education sector).

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by operations and
outcomes)

32.     The PDO was to support the implementation of the Government's "Education
Emergency Plan 2009-2012" to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of service
delivery and educational outcomes. Three main areas were the object of this operation:
(i) achieve universal basic education by 2015; (ii) improve system performance (teaching,
management and stewardship); and (iii) mobilize and utilize resources. The majority of
PDOs were achieved, particularly for areas (i) and (iii) - the objectives related to primary
enrollment and lower secondary completion were achieved, as well as increased budget
transparency and donor partners working together toward a common goal. Less
successful were goals relating to improving 4th grade student achievement in math (where
no change was seen) and improving system performance – where ground-setting progress
was made, but some goals missing targets.

33.     In general terms, EDPL1 contributed to efficiency in that it allowed for: (i) better
use of Government’s resources by improving coordination between certain ministerial
departments; (ii) better coordination with and between donors; (iii) maximizing the
benefits of TA, reducing time and overlapping effort on a large number of evaluations;
and (iv) unifying reporting requirements and enhancing strategic planning. Many of the
EEP initiatives have been described in terms of having had a “ground setting? impact;
however, an impact on educational outcomes is not yet evident. A second round of
national student learning assessments is planned to take place before the end of the 2012-



                                               15
2013 school year. Additional information from these assessments will provide a better
indicator of impact on quality.

34.     In June 2012, the African Development Bank prepared a report 15 (not yet
published) that analyzed the education and training systems in Morocco and raised
serious issues related to system efficiency. The study concluded that Morocco mobilizes
large amounts of public resources for the education sector but, as opposed to most other
comparable countries, it does not result in satisfactory levels of performance in terms of
both quantity of overall system coverage and quality of student learning.

35.    The following section describes the impact of the ten prior actions from the
policy matrix that are specific to EDPL1.

PPDE1.1: The MOE publishes on its website its Education Emergency Program 2009-
2012 for the reform of the education and training sector.

36.    The EEP was published on the MOE’s website in both French and Arabic and was
seen as a positive move towards greater transparency and accountability (see Annex 6 for
website address).

PPDE1.2: Increase boarding scholarship and extend the duration of the scholarship to
cover the full school year

37.     The 80% increase in the amount of the boarding scholarship and the extension of
its duration had by 2010/11 resulted in a 20% growth over the 2008/09 baseline. This
measure appears indeed to have stimulated education demand among vulnerable families
and to have had a positive impact in promoting equity and retention and decreasing
school drop-outs. The scholarship amount was increased from 700 MAD to 1260 MAD
(US$81 to US$146 equivalent) per quarter and was extended to cover the entire academic
year. School dropout and retention rates were improved in beneficiary populations. In
some areas where school supply was inadequate, the increased demand led to class
overcrowding and concerns about the quality of school provided meals. These issues
highlight the need to coordinate efforts that stimulate demand with school capacity.
Moving forward, the ministerial Department of Social Assistance (DAS), in charge of
this measure, stated its intention to request an increase in the scholarship amount and
coverage. The DAS will continue to monitor the scholarship’s impact and are currently
modifying how school meals are procured in a planned project with the World Food
Programme. In addition, the MOE will review, and revise if needed, the rules that
guarantee student security and personal development at boarding schools.

PPDE1.3: Publication of results of the first national student learning assessment survey
(PNEA)

38.     This priority measure was seen as highly relevant for continued educational
reform. The first national student learning assessment was undertaken jointly in 2007 by
the CSE and the MOE, the results of which were published by the CSE in 2009. The
public availability of the results highlighted the low level of student achievement
(particularly given the large amount of public funding devoted to the sector) and
generated active debate among many different stakeholders, including ministries,
teachers, parents and education focused associations. In addition, the public debate
provided the Government with an opportunity to create awareness about the objectives
and actions proposed in the 2009-2012 reform program. The measure was instrumental in
further motivating the continuation of education reforms and promoting accountability in
the education system. The second national student learning assessment is planned to take
place by the end of the 2012-2013 school year. There is now general consensus that such
assessments should take place regularly - every two or three years, testing the same grade
levels – and that results should continue to be made public so that stakeholders have a
platform for debate and an opportunity to hold accountable the authorities in charge. The
second assessment was delayed because the education system had not stabilized in the
post-Arab Spring period so the results of an assessment in 2011-2012 would not likely
have reflected any major policy impacts. The national assessment debates also sparked
increased discussions about Morocco’s participation in international assessments (namely
TIMSS and PIRLS) - discussions that are on-going.

PPDE1.4: Transfer teacher training colleges to universities

39.     A positive rating of the impact of this measure is not unanimous. Aligning teacher
training colleges (Ecoles Normales Supérieures, ENS) to universities was the first step in
establishing the country’s pre-service teacher education. The objective of the measure
was to improve the preparation of students for the teaching profession. The first co-hort
of students for secondary pre-service training finalized the 2-year training in June 2012.
The cohort for primary pre-service training will finalize the 3-year training program in
2013. Pre-service training is expected to enhance pedagogical training and create
adequate bi/polyvalent profiles that match the needs of the education system. Teaching
methods are expected to become more effective so that student learning is fostered. Also,
the presence of bi/polyvalent profiles will allow better optimization of human resources.

40.     Since 2010, all ENS have been transferred to a university. While it is too soon to
conclude that the quality of teaching has improved in the classroom, it was reported that
90% of recent teacher candidates passed the qualifying exam for teaching French (the
same test that is administered in France). The MOE reports that it has met its pre-service
training goals for 2009-2012. It considers this measure a positive step and intends to
continue efforts to professionalize teaching, including adding distance training courses.
Indications are that teacher unions are also supportive of the new policy. AREFs may be
less satisfied; the AREF the ICR mission visited and interviewed indicated that they felt
they have lost a voice in the number and profiles of teachers that will be needed locally



                                           17
and that trained teachers could be lost to the private sector – either as teachers or to other
professions.

PPDE1.5: Adoption of a Strategic Human Resource Management Action Plan for 2009-
2012

41.     This measure faced a number of limitations and obstacles and did not fully meet
the stated objectives. However, it is recognized as having laid important groundwork for
rapid future progress. The main objective of the measure was to decentralize human
resources (HR) management to AREFs, thereby improving HR efficiency. The measure
was not fully successful due to the following limitations: (i) the absence of HR structures
at the AREF level; (ii) incomplete roll-out of the MASIRH management tool; and (iii)
lack of necessary management capacities at the AREF level. The central HR department
deems it important to continue the decentralization process and plans to begin training
existing AREF staff to take on greater HR functions in 2013 and to create the necessary
local level positions. Teachers unions oppose the decentralization of HR to AREFs
because they feel their status of “civil servant? will be demoted to that of an AREF
employee, thereby negatively affecting their civil service pension schemes.

PPDE1.6: Each AREF develops and adopts a program-contract with MOE

42.     This measure is seen as having made positive progress toward decentralization
but only partially achieving its objectives. The idea was that each of the 16 AREFs
would develop its own reform program (and accompanying regional MTEF) for the
period 2009-2012, thereby implementing a program that would allow for more relevant
and pragmatic initiatives adapted to local needs. Actual contracts were not formalized,
but this was seen as an important measure because the contractual “spirit? was evident
and counterparts (between central and regional administrations) worked as if contracts
actually existed – so much so that the idea of formalizing these contracts remains a
priority in the national 2013-2016 reform program. The Ministry of Economy and
Finance (MEF) and Ministry of Higher Education are currently evaluating the experience
of formalizing contracts at the tertiary level, and the MOE will consider their findings in
determining whether or not these contracts should be formalized for the pre-university
level. Another positive outcome is that since AREF activities were monitored twice
annually by central level authorities, areas of weak capacity were identified and could
thus be addressed. The practice of AREFs developing their programs and discussing them
with the MOE has continued on an annual basis. Consensus emerged that roles and
responsibilities of the multitude of education sector actors, including consequences of not
meeting responsibilities, need to be clarified. The AREF of Kenitra expressed interest in
being more closely involved in the development of the overall national strategy so that
the sense of “instructions from above? does not de-motivate implementation at the more
local level. Further inquiries with other stakeholders suggest that this is the case for other
AREFs as well.




                                             18
PPDE1.7: Provision for a discretionary budget for non-staff-related recurrent costs for
school year 2009/10

43.      This measure experienced a slow start, but authorities involved reported its
important contribution to the first decentralizing efforts of fund management to the
school level. Since schools are not legally allowed to receive funds directly, Successful
School Support Associations (AAER) were created to receive funds. Each AAER
received 50,000 MAD (approx. US$5,900 equivalent) to be used at the discretion of the
association, headed by the school principal. The MOE provided guidelines on how the
funds could be used. For example, the funds could be used for any activity that positively
impacted or promoted learning, such as setting up a theater or arts club, or for quick
minor school repairs (e.g., broken windows, loose tiles) to improve the classroom.
Initially there was some resistance in using the funds because of the new responsibility
and accountability for showing positive outcomes and the potential scrutiny about the
choice of fund use. After some initial hesitance, AAERs felt empowered and began
developing detailed plans for using the funds. By 2011, 19,274 schools created projects
with their AAER, representing 80.6% of the target 23,921. The upcoming PAGESM 16
project (funded by Canada) will provide training to AAERs on project development and
financial resource management.

PPDE1.8: Development of Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)

44.      This measure has had a positive impact in improving governance, particularly in
terms of prioritizing actions in line with available resources and demonstrating financial
gaps for the short term. Use of the MTEF began in 2002, but was generalized and
improved between 2009 and 2012, in line with the EEP. The MTEF methodology was
instrumental in increasing governance by allowing for: (i) better planning and greater
visibility for short- and medium-term goals and priority actions for the sector; and (ii)
more effective management of time and required resources. The MTEF is updated on an
annual rolling basis, with the previous year dropped and a new out-year added. A new
MTEF for the sector was prepared in May 2012 to be fully in line with the Government’s
new development plan for education 2013-2016. In preparing the MTEF, the MOE took
into account an evaluation of the national macro-economic MTEF and evaluations of the
27 projects of the EEP – including their past performance and projected evolution. The
MOE reports that their capacity to prepare the MTEF has been greatly enhanced between
2009 and 2012 and partially credits the support it received from the TFPs. As a result, in
part, of the work on preparing the MTEF, the MOE has embarked on developing a plan
for its training needs; it will include financial planning and MTEF improvement as one of
the areas where capacity needs deepening.

PPDE1.9: Each AREF Board adopts its budget before January 31

45.     This measure produced successful results and highlighted some important issues.
Prior to this measure, some regional budgets were proposed so late in the year that there
was often insufficient time to use the funds. Now that the Board of each AREF is
required to approve (usually by November) and submit its budget to the MOE by January
of each year, funds are made available earlier so there is more time to use them, though
there have been some reported delays in the receipt of funds. Implementing this measure
put greater responsibility on the AREFs which, in an environment of decentralization, is
important; 90% of non-salary funds are now managed by the AREFs. Implementing this
measure also highlighted the need for MOE to improve the budgetary “tools? at the
central and regional levels. It also showed the need for a representative from the MEF to
be present for each AREF budget vote. The measure was somewhat undermined by the
late transfer of budgets from the central treasury to the AREFs. The Government has
committed to delivering the 2013 budget amounts to AREFs in January 2013,
immediately after AREF boards approve and submit their budgets.

PPDE 1.10: Signature of charter on relations between schools and their parents
association

46.     This measure was successful in reaching its objectives and helped highlight
challenges that will require continued concerted efforts for enhancing and supporting
collaboration between schools and parents’ associations (PAs). The signing of the charter
is seen as an important act because it formalized the relationship between the school and
its PA, clarifying the roles and responsibilities of each, and resulting in fewer conflicts
between the two. It recognized PAs as legitimate partners and provided them with a
status that would permit their receipt of capacity building support from the Government.
The charter was widely discussed before its signing and stakeholders agreed that it was
an important first step in getting students and parents to work together, but some
stakeholders felt that it remained too general, lacking specifics on “the how.? The MOE
subsequently encouraged and began to support PAs to create action plans jointly with the
School Management Council (Conseil de gestion d’établissement – CGE) in order to
operationalize the charter. Many schools have begun this process, but it is a major
undertaking that requires additional time.

47.       Some challenges:

      •   Only about 50% of schools have an operating PA. This figure is lower in rural
          areas where parents are less accustomed to association membership, even though
          they may individually be active in their child’s education. It is still a goal for
          2013-2016 that every school will have a functioning PA. The capacities and
          areas of involvement of existing PAs vary greatly across the country. PA training
          and support needs should be assessed and resources should be mobilized for this
          purpose. It is recognized that this will take major efforts in terms of time,
          coordination and funding.




                                             20
       •    Three national entities 17 represent most, but not all, PAs and there is
            disagreement between them on which, if any, is the most legitimate; this often
            leads to delays in establishing well-functioning coordination. To further
            complicate the question of representation, some PAs have members who are not
            parents of students and who represent interests of other groups, such as teachers
            or business owners.
       •    Many PAs report that they would be able to function more effectively if they
            were provided with even minimal physical space in the school as this would
            further legitimize their presence and allow them to better organize to reach out
            and communicate more effectively with a greater number of parents.
       •    Currently, PAs are funded only from parental contributions. This is considered
            to be insufficient.

48.     Moving forward, the MOE prepared a diagnostic evaluation of the impact of the
charter, highlighting successes and weaknesses, and used the evaluation as a base to
develop their action plan for inclusion in the new Medium Term Development Plan
(2013-2016), expected to be approved in the first quarter of 2013.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

49.     The PDO was highly relevant, but the achievement of the PDO is judged to be
moderately satisfactory since the PDO indicator was just missed: 26% of Grade 4
students reached math benchmarks vs. the target of >26%. Of the ten intermediate
indicators that were closely tracked by the Bank, six were achieved, some summarized
here:

         (i) Primary net enrollment rate: total net enrollment indicator exceeded. However,
              some disparities are evident in urban-rural and female-male ratios - which did
              not meet targets (data on indicators in Annex 7);
         (ii) Lower secondary net enrollment rate: indicators not met (53.9% reached vs.
              target of 74.7%). Disparity between rural and urban is still great (e.g., urban-
              rural for boys and girls combined reached 35.6% vs. target of 75.1% -
              representing a gain of only about 4 percentage points from 2008/2009 baseline);
         (iii) Completion rate for grades 1-9: for primary and secondary: all indicators met,
              even when disaggregated by sex and rural/urban.

50.     Targets for drop-out and repetition rates were not met. While much was done to
retain children in school through social programs, including Tayssir (conditional cash
transfers), improving school canteens, provision of school uniforms, student supplies and

transportation, and increasing boarding school scholarships, targets are now thought to
have been too ambitious, though some progress in decreasing drop-out rates was made:

    Primary         baseline 4.6%               actual 3.2% (target 2.2%)
    Lower secondary baseline 13.1%              actual 10.4% (target 7.3%)

51.     While there has been progress in increasing enrollment through efforts on both the
supply and demand sides, there is a consensus that the quality of education still remains
low. This was highlighted by the low level of student achievement as shown in the first
national student learning assessment (2007) and poor results in TIMSS (2007). However,
it is not a surprising finding for reform programs in the education sector because many
policy changes and new initiatives do not have an immediate impact in the classroom and
require time to become significantly effective. Revising teacher training programs,
developing student assessments systems and setting up a new M&E function are all
examples of initiatives that need time to have a positive impact on the ground.

52.     Considerable progress has been made in many areas: decentralization, increased
demand for education, supporting disadvantaged populations, teacher selection and
preparation, and modernizing management practices. These types of initiatives have set
the stage for further reforms and have contributed to new thinking and openness towards
trying new ways of doing things, the role of accountability and importance of self-
assessment and external evaluation – and the importance of keeping the child and the
classroom at the center of all efforts.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

53.     Data for 2011/12 indicate that while not all target indicators for gender
parity were met, EEP did have some positive impact at the pre-school and primary
levels (e.g., the primary female-male net enrollment ratio increased nearly 2 percentage
points from 96.8% to 98.6%); see Annex 7. While at the primary level there is a close
parity between female and male enrollment rates, the gap is wider in pre-school and
lower secondary levels, especially in rural areas. Female students have also registered
higher completion rates, and lower repetition and drop-out rates than male students.
Despite MOE´s targeted efforts, certain social practices, such as early marriage, were
cited as obstacles to greater progress in reforms related to access and equity at the
secondary level.

54.      The program targeted and gained some ground in reaching disadvantaged
groups, but was not fully successful in closing gaps. Net enrollment rates increased in
urban and rural areas at all levels and categories (except pre-school male rural), but the
rural-urban ratio worsened in pre-school and primary (comparing baseline with 2012
data). The rural-urban ratio only improved in lower secondary, but the gap is still wide.
It will be a challenge to sustain and expand such a large number of reforms, which is why
the Government has put so much emphasis on decentralization and the collaboration that
needs to happen at the local level between schools, the community and local level


                                               22
education structures (i.e., regional and provincial management). While school
construction is now well underway, the next phase of reforms will not only need to
continue building schools to meet demands, but communities and local authorities will
need to increase efforts to improve the education experience for students and to
encourage parents to become even more involved in their children’s education.

55.    School physical environments were improved with greater connectivity to
water and sanitation (latrines) and electricity.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

56.     Institutional change under the program happened at many levels and
positive strides were made in paving the way for more to be done. Institutional
change was mainly experienced through the many efforts supporting the decentralization
of school management and improvement to the local levels.                  Beginning the
decentralization process is often faced with many obstacles – from regulatory/legal
changes to craft and defend, and the need to prepare for inevitable and unforeseen
resistance from various stakeholders on almost all aspects of the process.

57.     The capacity of many actors in the education sector was strengthened, from
the central level to the local level. At the central level, the MOE departments involved
all reported having adopted new and better ways of doing things, demonstrating new
budgeting and planning tools to improved communications/use of internet with other
departments and with local level actors. At the local level, new monitoring tools are
being adopted, training needs are being assessed, school improvement/action plans are
being developed, and parents and schools are using partnership frameworks to plan and
interact with each other.

58.      While capacity has been built in many areas, the experience of the reform
program has brought to light priority areas where further training and learning
need to take place. This is a positive effect that will take additional time and resources to
address. With the increased responsibility at the regional level to make decisions about
priorities and initiatives, it has become clear that AREFs need to improve certain skills to
better manage functions with which they have previously had little experience - for
example, the procurement process for school construction and “monitoring? and
supporting teachers in new classroom procedures, such as using the student progress
books.

59.    It has become clear that budgetary planning and reporting, and the
development and use of compatible management tools and information systems are
areas where further strengthening needs to occur.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

60.    Efforts to increase the demand for education outpaced supply in some areas of the
country. This is seen to have diminished the potential greater impact the social programs


                                               23
could have had and, in some cases, has caused frustration and loss of confidence in the
reform efforts as they were seen as not being managed properly or without regard to the
realities on the ground.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not applicable.


4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low

61.   Education reform remains a priority of the newly elected Government, so
outcomes achieved by the end of this program are likely to be sustained in the 2013-2016
Medium Term Development Plan. Risks identified during program appraisal include:

      (i) The reform program may be confronted by resistance from unions,
       including teacher resistance to the efficiency measures and the move toward
       greater accountability. The MOE’s Department of Human Resources was pro-
       active in reaching out to unions (about 30 in the country concerned with
       education), holding over 250 meetings with them during the program period to
       discuss the new measures and to explain certain benefits for teachers as a result of
       the reforms, including how the Government is supporting the professionalization
       of teaching as a career. The MOE also worked closely with universities and
       teachers to: (i) create new paths of study for pre-service teacher training; (ii)
       carefully plan the transfer of the ENS to them; and (iii) begin the gradual
       decentralization of in-service teacher training. The MOE pointed out the positive
       experience of their increased communication, pro-actively taking steps to open
       debate and the critical need to continue involving teachers and unions in all
       reform efforts that affect them. The MOE also cited the successful example of
       requiring each region to have an In-service Training Action Plan that is based on
       regional and local needs.

      (ii) Financing education reforms could become constrained if the country’s
       macro-budget framework becomes too stretched due to other factors. Since
       the start this program in 2010, AECID and JICA joined the TFP group to provide
       more than US$75 million additional financing. Donors continue to pledge their
       support to the sector and provide input to the preparation of the MTEF. Financing
       was not an issue during this program and is not considered to be a major risk in
       the short term. Donors (including the Bank) hold frequent meetings with the
       MEF and MOE regarding the financial status of the education reforms. In
       addition, efficiency gains related to teachers were achieved, for example,
       Government counterparts reported that pupil : teacher ratios increased and that
       teachers were fulfilling more of their teaching load/hours teaching.




                                           24
          (iii) Ensuring adequate institutional capacity to support reform
           implementation remains a key challenge. Capacity was reported to have
           improved in many areas, but there is general consensus that more needs to be
           done at both the central and the regional/local levels, and donors have committed
           to making capacity building a priority as they continue to support the sector. The
           DSSP also takes the lack of capacity as a serious issue. They recently took the
           initiative to conduct a rapid assessment of capacity weaknesses at the central level
           and prepared a training plan for MOE staff. AREFs and Provincial Education
           Offices have expressed the need to receive support when being asked to pilot or
           implement a new activity. There was some expression that “marching orders?
           often arrived without more direction on the “how to.? This raised some points of
           frustration as well as expectations that in reality could not be fully met.
           Improving communication channels was cited by many actors as key to raising
           awareness about the areas where just-in-time capacity building was needed.
           While donors contributed resources for TA and capacity building, the inflexibility
           of TFP internal procedures was cited as a hindrance to staff receiving training
           when an unforeseen and/or urgent need arises. Increasing institutional capacity
           remains a priority for all stakeholders and partners as reforms move forward.


5.          Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
      Rating: Satisfactory

62.    The Bank´s performance in ensuring quality at entry was “satisfactory;? the
Program preparation took into account existing strategies for the education sector
and was prepared in a highly participatory manner. The EPDL1 was directly in line
with the Government’s education reform program as well as with the second pillar of the
2009 CPS (improving service delivery). In addition, the Program Document cited five
important pieces of analytical work that were consulted in preparation of the EEP and the
EDPL1, from which recommendations were taken on improving the sector program.18
The preparation work also built on numerous technical studies that were carried out under
the Bank-financed PARSEM project and by other donors, especially the European
Commission.

63.    The program was prepared in close collaboration with the Government and
with four other donors in the education sector. A non-binding partnership framework
was signed by all during project preparation and the TFP group crafted a common results
framework and common monitoring and reporting arrangements. In addition, the group


18
     For details, see World Bank Program Document, Report No. 52749-MA, p. 24




                                                        25
developed and signed a memorandum of understanding and an Operational Manual that
stipulates institutional arrangements for implementation, financial procedures and
accounting mechanisms, and M&E requirements.

64.     During preparation, the Bank team recognized a number of risks and proposed
mitigation measures (discussed earlier), including having identified the significant need
for institutional capacity building and TA. However, much of the TA financing that was
made available was not used due to the lack of capacity at the MOE. More will need to
be done in terms of addressing low capacity issues as they arise. MOE staff would
benefit from training in project/task preparation and management, procuring consulting
services, data analysis, M&E, and developing/implementing communications strategies.
Other mitigation measures had positive effects. For example, the increased pro-active
engagement the Government undertook with teacher unions was seen to have eased the
acceptance of certain reform measures, such as the transfer of pre-service teacher training
to universities.

65.    Finally, the design of the EPDL1 was built upon lessons learned from the
implementation of PARSEM, the implementation of the sector-wide approach as well as
the results/report-based disbursement methods. All of these efforts contributed to
enhancing the consistency and quality of the project design.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)
   Rating: Satisfactory

66.     The Bank team provided valuable TA and operational advice during
supervision (two missions annually) and volunteered to act as lead donor of the TFP
group for 2011. During the ICR mission, DSSP and other donors consistently reported
that the Bank team made critical and valuable contributions to the group’s work.

67.    The Bank team, along with other donors, met with representatives of major
teachers unions to improve mutual understanding and dialogue around the role of donors
in supporting the Government's reform agenda.

68.     Supervision missions were well prepared and inclusive of Government and
donor partners. Per mission aide memoires, supervision was very comprehensive and
always included a variety of expert consultants, including an M&E expert (discussed
earlier). Performance indicators were reviewed during each mission and classified into
categories of progress. Missions included field visits to schools, provincial education
offices and regional education offices to monitor implementation of actions on the
ground. The TFPs prepared very detailed aide memoires, including specific
recommendations and actions agreed with the Government on moving forward in each
area of the policy matrix.

69.    TFPs and the MOE recognized that support to the Government team between
missions could have been even more pro-active. It was subsequently agreed in 2012 that
more collaboration via weekly or semi-monthly meetings would improve the


                                            26
implementation of the reforms.        This practice has proven effective according to
Government counterparts.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
      Rating: Satisfactory

70.     Overall Bank Performance is rated satisfactory. Project design was well grounded
in analytical work, and was linked to the Government reform strategy and planned Bank
support to the sector. Preparation was well coordinated and inclusive of partners and
drew on lessons learned from previous project implementation experience. Limited
Government capacity was identified as a risk to project success. More intense follow up
could have been undertaken to support the MOE implementing team, particularly
between the semi-annual supervision missions.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
      Rating: Satisfactory

71.      Three main ministries supported the program:
      1. the MEF - the “Borrower?
      2. the Ministry of General Affairs and Governance - the Bank’s counterpart for
         general oversight of the DPL
      3. the Ministry of Education (MOE) - the implementing ministry

72.     Government performance is rated satisfactory. The Government was highly
committed to the program, as evidenced in part by the substantial portion of its budget it
allocated to the education sector: 24% of the national budget and 6% of GDP in 2012.
The MEF frequently monitored progress toward program objectives and initiated an audit
by the IGF. Officials of the MEF’s budget department and public buildings department
closely followed the program’s activities and were knowledgeable about the obstacles
that were encountered during implementation, and began attending the semi-annual
budget voting meetings at AREFs. These two MEF departments worked together with
the MOE to prepare a training plan for AREF staff who now have greater responsibility
for maintaining budgetary and accounting systems and governance and internal “self?
auditing. The MEF also supported the MOE in the preparation of its 2009 MTEF as the
MOE was chosen as a pilot ministry for budgetary reforms in 2002. Greater support from
the MEF for areas where capacities were limited was noted by the MOE and the AREFs
as being needed.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.     The performance of the implementing agencies is rated moderately
satisfactory. The program was implemented by a number of departments of the central
MOE and by the 16 regional AREFs (including Provincial Education Offices and local
level authorities). The main weakness identified for the implementing agencies most


                                            27
often related to limited capacity, especially at the regional levels, and lack of just-in-time
technical support. One example is that when the procurement process for school
construction and rehabilitation was delegated to the regional level, it became clear that
the technical and operational/management capacities were insufficient to run the process
smoothly and quickly. The training and support needed for this process could have been
better anticipated and would have avoided the long delays in implementation that were
experienced.

74.      The DSSP prepared comprehensive semi-annual progress reports covering
technical and financial issues. These reports were very useful in tracking a wide range of
statistical information for the reform program. Feedback on the reports indicated that the
analysis of the statistics could have been deeper. This was cited as an area for capacity
building for the MOE.

75.     The MOE is aware of its capacity needs and is prioritizing the development of
staff skills, when possible, rather than outsourcing the work of the ministry to external
consultants. Priority areas for capacity building include strategic education planning,
financial resource planning and management, monitoring and evaluation, and risk
identification and management.

76.    While many central level departments began working together more closely
during the program implementation period, insufficient communication from central to
more local levels was recognized as a weakness at the central level where more could
have been done. This has had a negative and stalling impact on decentralization efforts.
A greater focus on communications and more efforts to harmonize information systems
could have been made.

77.    Weaknesses were also identified at the local levels. Decentralization of
responsibilities was a pillar of the reform program; however, the organizational structures
and appropriately trained staff at the AREFs were not in place, thus hindering some of the
decentralization efforts.

78.      Certain factors beyond MOE’s control also hindered optimal performance:

          • Changes in top level government leaders and changes to the constitution;
          • A large number of experienced staff at the MOE retired during the program
            implementation period;
          • Ambitious program objectives and overly optimistic targets for selected
            indicators led to a perception that everything was a priority and that there was
            little sense of what really needed to happen first and how the multitude of
            efforts could best be coordinated.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




                                             28
79.    The “Government? performance is rated satisfactory and the “implementation
agency? performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The implementing agency was
responsible for the day-to-day execution of the reform and, as such, faced greater
challenges than the ministries less involved; therefore, greater importance is given to the
implementing agency’s rating (MS).


6.        Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)

80.     It is important for DPLs to come with a package of technical support that has
the procedural flexibility to allow for just-in-time capacity building and technical
assistance. Budgetary support to the education sector should set up a mechanism that
will allow for TA to be provided reforming implementers easily so that when lack of
capacity in an unforeseen area arises, it is possible to respond quickly and adequately
with the needed support. TFP internal procedures currently do not have the flexibility to
make this happen. While the MOE and AREFs can identify (and have identified) areas
for which staff need training or technical support, it is not always possible to plan for
every possible task they will face during implementation. Reform programs are complex
and can take new directions or come up with new, innovative approaches along the way.
Reform implementers need to be able to request and receive technical and/or operational
support on an as-needed basis, in addition to the capacity building they already know is
required.

81.     Governments should consider using national student learning assessments, in
addition to international assessments, as a means of assessing the quality of
education. Using international assessments, such as TIMSS and PIRLS, is a good way
to benchmark student achievement as compared to other countries, but national
assessments allow for a more contextual benchmark as they are based on national
curricula and content standards, which differs greatly between countries. The second
round of national assessments that was to take place in Morocco in 2011 was postponed
due to the Arab Spring, but the MOE plans to run the assessment in 2013.

82.     Multi-donor operations require some trade-offs from all parties. Government
counterparts reported that donors often come with a certain set of priorities in the
education sector that may differ from their own, and from other donors. For example, a
particular donor may place strong emphasis on decentralization and school-based
management, whereas the Government, or other donor, may prioritize activities that favor
perhaps a specific sub-sector of the system (e.g. secondary or vocational training). Multi-
donor operations call for a certain willingness to compromise.

83.       When executing a complex system-wide reform, it is critical to:

      •   Set more realistic objectives and target indicators through greater
          involvement of the reform implementers at the planning stage. Reform




                                               29
         implementers are best placed to speak to what is possible on the ground. Goals
         and objectives are often set at the national level.

     •   Prioritize actions per year of the reform, taking into account the available
         human and financial resources and limitations, and timing – which is important
         for the education sector given that results should be achieved at specific times of
         the year to best coincide with the school calendar. In particular, the coordination
         of measures that impact other measures is crucial, for example, synchronizing
         efforts to increase demand for education with the supply activities, and
         recognizing that the increasing demand for education needs to be accompanied by
         an increase in demand for better quality education.

     •   Activate and strengthen communication channels from the central to the
         local levels, as well as between the main actors across ministries at the central
         level. Given that decentralization was an important focus of the program, it is
         critical that stakeholders (actors and beneficiaries) at local levels are involved in
         the planning stages since they will be responsible for the actual execution of
         activities and will need to be empowered and motivated to do so. It is equally
         important for central level actors to communicate more frequently as reform
         measures are being implemented.

     •   Recognize that school location and atmosphere are important factors for
         many reform initiatives. Ultimately, education reforms should have a positive
         impact at the school level, where teachers and students are most present and
         where the environment supports engaged and meaningful learning. Efforts to
         discourage absenteeism need to remain central. Schools must be reachable,
         secure, have access to water and electricity, support teachers and be a place where
         students and teachers want to be. Community schools should continue to be
         piloted and supported in geographic areas where it makes sense.


7.       Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

84.    There are differing opinions among Government authorities on whether a DPL, a
SIL or a Program for Results approach is the best instrument for delivering World Bank
financing. The MEF and MAGG favor the DPL, but the MOE prefers traditional project
investment loans.

85.     Implementing counterparts from the central level agree that overall the EEP
2009-2012 was greatly beneficial for improving the education sector, even though it
did not reach all of its objectives. Progress was made in many strategic projects, but a lot
of what was accomplished was still very much “setting the stage? for continuing and
expanding reforms. While some changes in processes and decision-making procedures
(e.g. budget validation) were made, the impact of many of these changes has not yet




                                              30
made much of an impact on the quality of education or changed much at the classroom
and school levels. Details are provided in Annex 5.

86.    At the regional level, implementing counterparts report that many positive
things have happened during the program period and specifically cited: social
programs for creating demand, improved relationships between schools and parents
associations and better budget and strategic planning. They also pointed out that
implementation could have been more effective if the “directions? that came down from
the central level were accompanied by TA and capacity building and if they had had an
opportunity to modify certain approaches to make them fit better with the local context.
Further details are provided in Annex 5.

(b) Cofinanciers

87.   Partners financially supporting the Government’s education reform program
2009-2012 included:

       1.   African Development Bank                             EUR 75 million
       2.   European Investment Bank                             EUR 200 million
       3.   European Union                                       EUR 93 million
            (grant)
       4.   Facilité d’Investissement de Voisinage               EUR 15 million
            (grant)
       5.   French Development Agency                            EUR 50 million
       6.   Spanish Int’l Cooperation Agency for Development     EUR 14 million
            (grant)

        Partners reported that the “consortium approach? for joint support and
        supervision of the reform program has been a positive experience and has
        had several advantages, including greater access to the Minister and more
        streamlined M&E. However, some obstacles were also cited, including individual
        donor priorities, lack of prioritization at the MOE and heavy administrative
        governmental procedures (further details in Annex 5).

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

In addition to comments on specific points in the ICR, which have been incorporated into
this document, below is a brief summary of the Government’s feedback on the ICR.

Global Perspective. The objectives of the Government’s Programme d’Urgence (2009-
2012) were ambitious, particularly given the weak technical and organizational capacity
of some of the implementing agencies involved. This is likely one of the main reasons
that the Programme did not reach all of its goals. However, the project was beneficial for
the education system in Morocco in that it rolled out new mechanisms for system
management on a multi-annual platform, for multiple projects with multiple sources of
funding. Another benefit was the improvement of monitoring and monitoring capacity of
project results and indicators, which will be particularly important for the continuing
reforms.

One area where great efforts were made and are considered successful was increased
support to social programs, such as the Tayssir program, which increased boarding school
scholarships and helped to increase demand for schooling and decrease student dropouts
in rural areas. Another area where major efforts were made was in training, particularly
the training school directors and pre-service teacher training, thanks to the creation of the
Regional Centers for Education and Training.

Communications between the MOE and the local levels has improved, but even more
communication and capacity building efforts will be necessary moving forward as
decentralization efforts to Regional Education Offices and Provincial Education Units
continue. The MOE plans to provide a budgetary and information system that will be
adopted by the Regional Education Offices. The system is currently being piloted and is
expected to be complete by end March 2013.

The preschool sub-sector has not yet made the enrollment targets that had been hoped,
particularly in rural areas and for girls. In addition, difficulties in data collection for this
sub-sector remain. Much better progress has been seen, however, in the other levels,
especially the primary cycle in terms of enrollment and gender and urban/rural parity.

Collaboration with PTFs and looking forward. The country has benefitted from its
collaboration with its technical and financial partners supporting the education sector.
The regularly held semi-annual joint missions have turned out to be an efficient way to
periodically review the entire education system. We have expressed our desire to have
more assistance from our partners in: capacity building, strategic planning and operation
of the education system, procurement processing and developing/updating the Medium
Term Expenditure Framework at the central, regional and provincial levels. We have
also expressed the need to improve obtaining technical assistance and launching the
various studies we would like to undertake, given their importance in guiding education
reform policies.

    Annex 5. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

    Note: information in this annex was derived from interviews with Government and donor
    partners during the ICR mission.

    Implementing partners from the central level agree that overall the EEP 2009-2012
    was greatly beneficial for improving the education sector, even though it did not reach
    all of its objectives. Progress was made in many strategic projects, but a lot of what was
    accomplished was still very much “setting the stage? for continuing and expanding
    reforms. While some changes in processes and decision-making procedures (e.g. budget
    validation) were made, the impact of many of these changes has not yet made much of an
    impact on the quality of education or changed much at the classroom and school levels.

    Specific points from the central level:

•   Public procurement procedures are slow and bureaucratic. The MOE expressed their
    preference towards using donors’ procedures for procuring firms and consultants to
    conduct studies and other technical assistance, even though it is recognized that donors’
    procedures can sometimes be slow as well;
•   Still need better accounting systems for tracking funds;
•   Still need compatible and integrated systems to allow for better communication and
    information sharing at central level and between central and local levels;
•   More open dialogue between MOE and the TFPs has improved and there is now a greater
    sense of partnership working more collaboratively towards a higher level set of
    objectives, as opposed to tracking progress indicators.

    At the regional level, implementing partners report that many positive things have
    happened during the program period and specifically cited: social programs for
    creating demand, improved relationships between schools and parents associations and
    better budget and strategic planning. They also pointed out that implementation could
    have been more effective if the “directions? that came down from the central level were
    accompanied by TA and capacity building and if they had had an opportunity to modify
    certain approaches to make them fit better with the local context.

    Specific points heard from regional/provincial levels:
•   Simplify academic curriculum which currently lends itself to personal prioritization by
    teachers, allows for too much choice, and often leads to teachers having to teach similar
    classes for small numbers of pupils (time for preparation, cost,..);
•   The collection of comprehensive data related to economic and social backgrounds of
    students, school environment, etc., at the time of national examinations (PNEA) would
    allow complex multivariate analysis and, as a result, a more detailed analysis of factors
    affecting results;
•   They want to be more involved in the preparatory efforts of the new Medium Term
    Development Plan 2013-2016 so priorities can be decided locally to fit the local contexts
    – particularly since they are more in touch with parents, teachers and students;



                                               36
•   HR reforms (recruitment, professional development) have not yet trickled down enough
    to have a great impact at the local level;
•   The national learning assessments were not conducted efficiently; results were superficial
    and unreliable. They were not invited to provide feedback on the 2007 experience of
    rolling out the national exams;
•   TFPs come with perceived notions/ideas regarding indicators that are impossible to
    achieve (e.g., 100% enrollment) and that there are too many indicators and sometimes the
    wrong ones. TFPs make development and reform “heavy.?

    Partners (six other donors) reported that the “consortium approach? for joint
    support and supervision of the reform program has been a positive experience and
    has had several advantages:

• TFPs had greater access to the Minister;
• Communications with the DSSP were more streamlined and easier to strengthen;
• M&E was carried out fairly easily, but an even more simplified instrument (policy
  matrix) could be developed;
• Technical assistance to the DSSP could have been better coordinated and could have
  focused more on project management type skills.

    Several obstacles that hindered implementation were cited:

• Weak capacity at the MOE and regional levels – they need a budget for capacity building
  but it is not likely MEF will provide this;
• Data are not always seen to be reliable – this points out the need to be very specific about
  data requests, spelling out clearly what should be included/ excluded;
• Individual donor priorities can get in the way (e.g. one donor may emphasize the
  importance of private sector involvement in the sector, while others do not) but all TFPs
  are working to better harmonize priorities;
• There is a lack of prioritization at MOE which often waters down efforts, generally
  speaking, that could make a greater impact;
• Heavy bureaucratic and administrative governmental procedures also hindered program
  implementation. Decision making is still very centralized, causing further delays when
  key public officials are unavailable and decision-making authority is not delegated;
• Partners witnessed disappointment and de-motivation at the regional/local levels due to
  the top down management approach which did not take into account local knowledge of
  the existing issues, challenges and contexts.
