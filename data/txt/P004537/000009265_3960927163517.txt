MEMORANDUM AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE MECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR THE FOURTH SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.         The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of the Philippines for US$60 million is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be for 20 years including 5 years grace
at the standard variable interest rate and would help finance the
development of small and medium i-ndustries. The proposed Project would be
cofinanced by ADB for US$100 million, the ASEAN-Japan Development Fund for
US$40 million, and the Japan Grant Facility for US$3.6 million equivalent.
2.         Background.   The  Small and Medium  Industry '(SM)  sector,
comprising firms with less than P20 million in assets and 200 employees,
is an important contributor to the manufacturing sector, accounting for
about 21X of value-added and 432 of employment. SMI firms are important
in a wide range of manufacturing subsectors contributing over 301 of value
added in food processing, machinery and equipment, chemicals, rubber,
printing, plastic products, furniture and wood products, and wearing
apparel. Recently, the SMI sector, and SMI exporters in particular, are
being viewed as the catalyst to promoting economic recovery and export
growth.
3.         Like many other countries, SMI firms in the Philippines have
been faced with important barriers to their development. Restrictive trade
policies and fiscal incentives worked against SMI firms and exporters by
encouraging large capital intensive and import substitution industries and
by cumbersome and costly procedures which limited SMI access to incentives.
There were several special incentives provided for cottage industries which,
in practice, tended to inhibit the growth of potentially efficient firms.
These biases, together with the banking sector's cautious approach to
lending to poorly collateralized and small and new firms have also meant
that SMIs have had difficulty obtaining finance through traditional banking
channels.
4.         In the past few years, the Government has made significant
progress in reducing some of these biases.   Since 1980, it has been
implementing far reaching tariff and trade reforms. The special incentives
for cottage industry were abolished.  BOX incentives were restructured,
making them more neutral among different types and sizes of firms. Some
steps have been taken to try to increase the registration of SMI firms for
incentives. The Government has provided a major channel for financing the
investment needs of SI firms through the Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund
(IGLF). The Government has also sponsored a range of technical assistance
and training programs for SMI firms.
S.         The IGLF is a government-owned fund, administered by the Central
Bank. IGLF operates as an apex unit channeling funds through accredited
financial institutions to SMI firms in the manufacturing sector. The IGLF
has been funded primarily by external donors although the Government has
p nvided some equity funds. The Government takes the foreign exchange risk
u. externally borrowed funds and lends them to IGLF. IGLF then refinances
term loans of accredited financial institutions made to their SMI clients.



-2-
6.         The World Bank has supported IGLF in three previous projects
(Loans 1120-PH, 1727-PH and 2169-PH). Under these loans the Bank approved
US$187 million, the IGLF portions of which have been fully disbursed (net
of cancellations). The IGLP credit components of these loans have generally
performed well and achieved their objectives of channeling substantial term
credit to SMIs, increasing the number of financial instizutitns
participating in the program and operating with low arrears and high
collection ratios.
7.         While these all represent major  steps forward, a number of
important issues remain that restrict SMI firms' access to finance and
incentives.  The interest rate arrangements under the IGLF program have
lagged behind changes in the overall interest rate regime in the
Philippines, which is now largely market determined with floating interest
rates the norm.   As such, the IGLF program is exposed to considerable
volatility and fails to cover adequately the Government's interest, and
foreign exchange risks. SMI access to credit is restricted because of the
lack of interest by the banks in lending to SMIs, due to weak collateral and
the higher cost and efforts of credJt appraisal of small firms.   A
government sponsored credit guarantee program has not been effective in
offsetting these constraints. Domestic financial resources are still not
being allocated in significant amounts for term lending to SMI firms.
Access to incentives is still a problem for SMI firms, especially exporters.
Complex administration and costly procedures exclude most SMI exporters from
obtaining adequate duty rebate or exemption on their imported inputs. Short
term pre-shipment export finance is difficult for SMI exporters to obtain
because of the highly restricted coverage of the existing pre-shipment
guarantee.
8.         Rationale  for  Bank  Involvement.    The main  rationale  for
continuing Bank involvement in the SMI sector is to help Government address
these constraints on SMI firms. This will require modification in existing
programs, introduction of new policies and operational measures, and
institution building.  In preparing this proposed Project, the Bank has
given particular attention to eliminating interest rate distortions
undermining the IGLF program. In this regard, the proposed Project would
address an important issue raised more generally in the Bank's recent
Financial Sector Report (August/88), which recommends that the Government
accelerate the move towards market-determined lending terms for directed
credit programs. While the proposed Project would address only the IGLF
subsector, it nonetheless could have a broader impact by demonstrating the
viability of market-based lending for directed programs.
9.         In addition, the proposed Project would also begin to address
some of the important constraints facing SMI exporters by following up on
the broad recommendations of the Bank's Industrial Sector Report (July/87).
The Project also provides an important vehicle for the Bank to continue its
dialogue with the Government on key export policy and institutional issues,
which we hope to build on in a comprehensive export project.



10.        Project Objectives.  The basic objectives of the proposed SMI IV
Project are to provide employment opportunities, improve income distribution
and regional development, and provide a catalyst for promoting general
economic growth and exports. The proposed Project specifically would help
to ensure thatt (a) long-term resources continue to be available for long-
term financing needs of the SMI sector; (b) the access of SHI firms to
finance is improved by strengthening the IGLF guarantee; (c) short-term pre-
shipment export finance, along with a strong pre-shipment export finance
guarantee, becomes more widely available to direct and indirect SMI
exporters; (d) SMI exporters have improved acoess to inputs at world prices
through streamlined and simplified duty drawback and exemption systems;
(e) key technical assistance programs to SMI firms are continued and user
cost-sharing is introd"-ed; and (f) institutional and policy reforms related
to SMI exporters are identified and appropriate z.easures designed.
11.        Project Description.   The proposed Project would have the
following componentss
(a) a Credit Component (comprising 99Z of total project cost)
channeled through IGLF to accredited financial institutions
in support of SMI long-term investment and short-term export
financing needs during 1989-1991. The Goverment will take
the foreign exchange risk on the World Bank loan and lend
the proceeds in domestic currency to IGLF on World Bank
terms.   IGLF will relend at domestic market rates to
accredited financial institutions which in turn will on-
lend to SMIs at freely determined competitive rates.
(b) an Export Component, which would provide consultancy
assistance and training, equipment and related supplies and
services, and administrative expenses to improve the access
of SMI exporters to duty drawback/exemption, export
finance/guarantee, product design, marketing and technology
assistance, and trade information services; and
(c) a Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Support Component,
which would provide training and equipment to strengthen
DTI's regional offices, especially as they support export
marketing programs, and technical assistance for policy
formulation and program design in export development.
12.        The total cost of the proposed Project is estimated at US$358.7
million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$162.1 million
(45Z). Retroactive financing of up to US$ 6 million is proposed for the
Credit Component to fund IGLF loans made after December 1, 1988.   A
breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.   The
disbursement schedule is shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Philippines
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 7531-PH dated March 15, 1989, is being distributed separately.

13.        Actions to be Agreed.  It was agreed during negotiations that a
revised IGLF Policy Mannal would include, provisions for: (a) the rate to
final beneficiaries would be determined by participating financial
institutions (PPXs) based on market conditions with no prespecif Led spread;
(b) the rediscount rate from IGLF to PFIs would be based on domestic market
rates and offered to the PFIs on either fixed or variable terms; (c) maximum
subloan size of Peso 20 million; (d) eligible firms being in manufacturing
or related service sectors with assets between Peso 50 thousand and Peso 20
million (before financing); (e) PFI's to contribute from their own fundA at
least 10? of each subloan; and (f) subloans being in compliance with
environmental laws. Other agreements reached include: (g) the preferential
interest rate to depressed regions would be limited to an average reduction
of 2? for designated regions, which are estimated to comprise about 72 of
the IGLF program; (h) the phasing-out of the preferential interest rates for
depressed regions according to an agreed schedule; (i) establishment of a
reserve account in IGLF for foreign exchange losses; (j) a timetable to
implement new measures to simplify and expedite claim procedures under IGLF
guarantees; and (k) adoption of institutional and operational measures to
expand significantly the coverage of the export pre-shipment guarantee
facility.
14.        Benefits. The proposed Project woule facilitate the continuation
of term financing for the SMI sector as well as support increased short-
term lending to SMI exporters. In addition to providing needed financial
assistance, the proposed Project would foster technical, administrative and
policy measures to help offset the constraints on SMI firms, especially
exporters, and facilitate their potential contribution to the Philippines'
objective of increasinlg non-traditional exports.
15.        The Bank loan would increase the long-term resources available
for SMI lending. It is expected that about 3,000 investment subprojects
will be financed, with subproject costs, including sponsors' equity, of
about P 7.6 billion (US$355 million) and an average subloan size of about
P 2.5 million (about US$120,000). These subloans are expected to generate
incremental direct employment of about 60,000. Since individual subprojects
to be financed under the loan are not yet identified, quantification of
their economic impact is not possible. However, under the Bank's past SMI
financing the ex ante financial rates of return have been robust. Further,
under the second SMI loan (1727-PH) an ex post analysis of a sample of firms
indicated an average 172 return on equity and showed that 902 of IGLF sub-
borrowers were profitable after full implementation.
16.        Risks.  There are no unusual project risks.  With respect to the
Credit Component, demand will be subject to the overall performance of the
economy. However, the demand projections are reasonably conservative and
are well within the historical growth performance of IGLF since 1980. The
introduction of market-based interest rates will also help to ensure that
credit demand is not subject to wide swings due to distortions in
admAinistered rates, as occurred in the past.



17.        Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the International Bank for
Recon6truction and Development and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
