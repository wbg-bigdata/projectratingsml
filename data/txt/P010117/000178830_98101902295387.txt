NEPAL - TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:                   Kingdom of Nepal
Amount:                     US$5.7 million equivalent
Terms:                      Standard
Project Description:        The project is designed to increase the supply of
qualified engineering technicians needed to imple-
ment Nepal's development programs. The IDA credit
would help finance facilities and equipment for
the Institute of Engineering of Tribhuvan Univer-
sity in order to: (a) strengthen the quality of
existing teaching programs for about 1,000 students
at the certificate level (Grades 11-12) and about
200 students in remedial courses; and (b) estab-
lish a new training program for about 430 students
at the diploma level (Grades 13-15). Related
staff training and specialists' services would be
financed by the Ministry of Overseas Development
of the United Kingdom. Also in conjunction with
the project, three studies would be carried out
to provide a basis for future development of the
education sector. The project faces no special
risks. However, expected benefits will be real-
ized only if the IOE limits enrollment to the
number specified above and is able to effect,
and maintain, the reorientation of its teaching
programs towards practical ends as intended.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for the equivalent of US$5.7 mil-
lion on standard IDA terms to help finance a technical education project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Review of the Economic
Situation of Nepal" (Report No. 1180-NEP) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on July 30, 1976. A country economic memorandum is under prep-
aration to be issued in March 1978. The principal findings of the memorandum
are described below. Country data are shown in Annex I.
3.        Nepal has been classified by the United Nations as one of the
least-developed countries in the world. Its per capita income in 1977 was
estimated at $120. It has a population of 12.9 M, estimated to be growing
at around 2% per year. A large proportion, nearly 96% of the population,
live in rural areas. Health and education facilities are below the standards
achieved in the rest of South Asia. Nepal has an infant mortality rate of 200
per thousand live births, an adult literacy rate of 19%, and a life expectancy
at birth of less than 44 years.
4..       The country has a difficult topography which severely limits the
area of arable land. Yet population density is now 450 per square kilometer
of arable land for all of Nepal and 930 persons in the Hill areas where 59% of
the people live. Already the results of pushing the area of cultivated land
beyond ecologically safe limits are being felt in the Hill areas. Agricul-
tural yields have declined, and soil erosion and landslides have resulted in
these areas. In the Terai plains where foodgrains, sugar and jute are grown,
little room is left for extending the cultivated areas. The traditional grain
surpluses produced in the Terai are declining as population has grown.
5.        The landlocked position of the country imposes an additional con-
straint. Par removed from sources of supplies of development goods and ac-
cess to export markets, development is more costly in Nepal than in many
other countries. Moreover, uncertainties of trade and transit over the sub-
continent complicates all economic decision-making, necessitates the holding
of relatively large foreign exchange reserves, and reduces the country's
attraction to private investors.



-2-
6.        The economy is predominantly agricultural.  About 68% of total
value added originates in agriculture, and over 90% of the labor force is
engaged in this activity. Agricultural products constitute more than 80% of
Nepal's exports. Ninety percent of these exports go to India. Rice, the main
export, accounts for about 60% of the total export value, while jute is the
second most important. Industrial value added amounts to only 4% of GDP and
Nepal, therefore, has to import almost all of its capital goods and a large
part of manufactured consumer goods.
7.        Between 1965 and 1975, Nepal's GDP growth rate averaged 2.4% per
year, marginally above the rate of population growth.  Thus far, development
efforts have been mostly directed towards building an economic and adminis-
trative infrastructure. This was necessary since it was only in the early
fifties that the Government adopted economic and social development as major
objectives. The investments in infrastructure made since then were the
country's first steps toward modernization. They have not yet paid off,
however, in terms of accelerated economic growth.
8.        There have been no significant changes in the trend of economic
growth in recent years. The weather continued to be the main factor which
determined yearly fluctuations in growth. While GDP grew at 2.5% in 1974/75,
marginally above the average rate for the decade, it rose to 6% in 1975/76,
largely as a result of favorable weather. In 1976/77, however, GDP growth
is estimated to have fallen below the average growth rate for the decade.
This was due to infavorable weather which affected paddy and wheat produc-
tion. The balance of payments, however, continued to improve during this
period. Although imports increased and exports were stagnant in 1976/77,
the adverse trade balance was more than offset by increased remittances
and earnings from tourism. As a result, foreign exchange reserves increased
by $21.7 million to $142.4 million, equivalent to about ten months of imports.
However, prospects are that the balance of payments will weaken, as food-
grain surpluses are declining and imports rising in response to increasing
developmental activity.
9.        After substantial efforts in the last two decades to build up the
country's infrastructure, Nepal's planners believe that the time has come for
a shift in the development strategy. The leading principle of the current
Five-Year Plan (1976-80) is that Nepal should aim its development efforts at
deriving increased production benefits from its past efforts to establish and
expand the infrastructure. The allocation of investment funds under the Plan
shows a drop in the share of transport and communications (from 41% to 23% of
the total) and corresponding increases in the shares of agriculture, industry
and the social sectors. Attention is to be concentrated on quick-yielding
projects, mostly in agriculture but with an appropriate component of viable
import substitution in industry.
10.       The most important opportunity to reap production gains lies in
agriculture. Present yields in the Terai, where most of the foodgrains
are cultivated, average only 1-1.3 tons per hectare. These yields can be
increased substantially by improvements in agricultural extension, by in-
creased application of inputs, adaptive research, and by irrigation.



-3-
Similar improvements could also be extended to sugar and jute cultivation
which also have very low yields. Over the long-run, the wide difference
between growing conditions in the Hills and in the Terai offers scope for
increased specialization and exchange of products. For the time being, the
Hills must continue to emphasize food production. Declining yields in the
face of a growing population have caused serious food deficits in these areas.
However, in the long-run, the Hill areas are comparatively well-suited to
produce cash crops -- fruits, spices, vegetables, potatoes and natural silk,
etc. On a limited scale such cash crops are already being produced in the
Hills. Achievement of production gains will also require the strengthening
of marketing and credit institutions. Some progress in institution-building
has already been made in recent years, as evidenced by the establishment of
the Agricultural Development Bank and the Agricultural Projects Services
Center.
11.       Although agriculture must occupy a predominant position in Nepal's
development strategy, opportunities also exist in other directly productive
sectors, mainly industry and tourism, and these should be vigorously pursued.
The contribution of modern industry to GDP is still small, about 4%, but it
has been growing. Most of the sector consists of the processing of agricul-
tural products such as rice, wheat, vegetable oil, sugar and jute. The re-
mainder is made up of factories producing simple consumer goods, wood pro-
ducts, bricks, tiles and cement. The small size of the market, lack of raw
materials, competition from Indian products, and the shortage of domestic
entrepreneurs and trained workers will continue to be limiting factors for
some time. Modern industry, nevertheless, has its role in Nepal's future
development. The scope for processing of agricultural products for domestic
use and export should increase with the intended diversification of agricul-
ture. In the meantime, however, industry must, by necessity, be predominantly
of a small-scale nature and an ancillary activity to agriculture, such as
cottage industry.
12.       Tourism has grown at 11.5% per year over the last five years;
tourist arrivals at present are estimated to be above 85,000. Foreign ex-
change earnings from this source are equivalent to about 25% of merchandise
exports. In line with a master plan for the sector, prepared with German
assistance, a number of projects are to be undertaken to develop hill sta-
tions, observation points, and national parks, as well as to restore ancient
temples, and to strengthen the hotel school. While small in size, these pro-
jects are important for the long-term development of tourism.
13.       On the basis of these and other considerations, it appears that
there is sufficient scope for development of the directly-productive sectors
to allow a modest acceleration of GDP growth to perhaps 3.5% a year during
the last years of the decade and 4-5% in the 1980s. The proposed develop-
ment strategy appears to be appropriate to Nepal's circumstances. The past
ratio of investment (8.5-10.5% of GDP) to growth (2% of GDP) appears to be
very high and, in view of the scarcity of resources in Nepal, the planners
are right in looking for opportunities for more rapid growth without neglect-
ing the need for completion of the basic infrastructure.



- 4 -
14.       Nepal has made commendable efforts to mobilize domestic resources
for development. In the last five years, real revenue growth has averaged
over 7% per year, much higher than the growth rate of GDP, and budgetary
savings were maintained at 40% of revenue, slightly over 3% of GDP. This
result was obtained in the face of serious difficulties. On the revenue side,
Nepal suffers from the constraints of extreme poverty and low degree of mone-
tization of the economy. The open border with India, moreover, makes it dif-
ficult to control foreign trade and to levy the trade taxes which play such
a large role in the tax system of most developing countries. On the current
expenditures side, the Government has to cope with rising claims for main-
tenance of infrastructure and the need to raise government salaries from
levels which are low even by the standards of a poor country.
15.       In view of the pressures to increase current expenditures, all that
can be realistically expected in the next few years is that the Government
maintains its savings rate at 3% of GDP. Only when economic growth starts
to accelerate significantly in the 1980s will there be prospects for an in-
crease in this rate. Given the constraints on mobilizing domestic resources,
which will prevail even with continued satisfactory fiscal management, foreign
aid will remain a decisive factor in Nepal's economic development. In fact,
since public savings are likely to increase less rapidly than public invest-
ment during the period of the current Five-Year Plan, aid will become, at
least temporarily, more important. In view of this scarcity of public savings,
aid will have to cover not only the foreign exchange cost of projects, but,
as a rule, also at least part of local cost. Total aid disbursements during
1971-75 (the previous Five-Year Plan) averaged $33 M a year in constant (1974/
75) prices and covered 45% of public investment. During 1976-80 (the present
Five-Year Plan), this proportion would have to rise to 57% if public invest-
ment is not to be held back by lack of financial resources. Under these cir-
cumstances, disbursements in real terms would have to rise by around 12.5%
per year to average about $60 M in constant (1974/75) prices and about $90 M
in current prices.
16.       The international community has thus far been very responsive to
these aid needs of Nepal. Shortage of finance has not yet been a bottleneck
and prospects are that aid flows of the required magnitude will continue to
be available. The real factor determining Nepal's development pace has been
its limited absorptive capacity, an important constraint on project prepara-
tion and implementation. It is the growth of this absorptive capacity which
will determine the actual level of aid disbursements. Technical assistance
is being provided by a number of donors to prepare a pipeline of projects
suitable for external financing which should help increase commitments.
Project implementation capacity is improving through aid to several govern-
ment agencies from various donors, but is by no means adequate. Strengthen-
ing of implementing agencies is only a partial solution; steps must concur-
rently be taken to alleviate the acute shortage of trained technical manpower
to carry out the physical implementation of projects. The essential questions
regarding aid to Nepal are, therefore, what donors should do to attune their
aid programs to Nepal's development priorities and what they can do to help
raise absorptive capacity.



- 5 -
17.       These questions, obviously requiring consultations between the Nepal
Government and the donors, provide the focus for the Nepal Aid Group which
had its first meeting in Tokyo in December 1976. On the basis of sector and
project documentation prepared by the Government, the meeting reviewed the
type of projects needed to support the Government's development strategy and
the type of technical assistance programs needed to build up absorptive capa-
city. Sustained attention to these matters in the framework of the Group is
expected to lead to improvements in the composition of aid and to speed up
the still very slow rate of disbursement of aid funds.
18.       As of December 31, 1976, official foreign debt amounted to $236 M,
of which 33% was to IDA.  Of the $236 M, $192 M remained undisbursed.  This
low utilization is largely due to the fact that the bulk of foreign loans has
been contracted since 1970. Debt service was about $2.3 M in 1977 or equiva-
lent to about 2% of exports of goods and services.  Most external loans will
probably continue to be on concessionary terms, which is highly desirable in
view of Nepal's poverty and limited export prospects. In view of the acceler-
ated development efforts, external public debt is expected to rise and, based
on the trend in recent years, may reach about $350 M by 1980, of which approxi-
mately 40% could be in IDA credits. The total debt service ratio by 1980 is,
however, projected to be about 5%.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NEPAL
19.       The first IDA credit to Nepal in the amount of $1.7 M equivalent was
made in FY70 for a telecommunications project. This was followed by credits
for highways ($2.2 M), tourism ($3.2 M), irrigation ($6.0 M), a second telecom-
munications project ($5.5 M), water supply and sewerage ($11.8 M), settlement
($6.0 M), power ($26.0 M), rural development ($8.0 M), groundwater ($9.0 M),
technical assistance ($3.0 M), a second water supply and sewerage project
($8.0 M), and the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation project ($4.0 M).
In FY78, to date, one credit has been approved for a second highway project
(US$17.0 M). The proposed credit would bring the total amount of IDA assist-
ance to Nepal to $117.1 M equivalent, net of cancellations. No Bank loans
have been made to Nepal. IFC made its first investment in Nepal ($3.2 M) in a
hotel project in Kathmandu in FY75. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank Group operations as of January 31, 1978, and notes on the execution of
ongoing IDA projects. It shows certain delays in the implementation of these
projects, particularly during the initial periods. These delays have been
largely due to Nepal's limited technical and managerial capabilities. In
order to assist Nepal in coping with this constraint, considerable technical
assistance is being given by Bank Group staff, including our Resident Mission
in Kathmandu. As a result, improvement in the rate of disbursements is being
realized. During the first six months of FY78, $8.4 M were disbursed compared
to $12.8 M disbursed during the entire previous seven years. There is,
however, substantial scope for further improvement.



-6-
20.       Bank Group lending to Nepal has so far been at a modest level com-
pared to the country's need for, and total receipts of, external assistance.
The international community has persistently shown considerable interest in
Nepal's economic development and, to date, the main constraint on the utili-
zation of increased aid has not been shortage of funds, but Nepal's limited
absorptive capacity. The Bank has agreed to assist the Government in project
preparation through the technical assistance credit and by acting as Executing
Agency for a number of technical assistance projects in the current UNDP Five-
Year Program. The Bank Group has also addressed the problem of absorptive
capacity through its role in organizing the Aid Group for Nepal (para 17).
21.       The Bank Group's current strategy places major emphasis upon the
directly-productive sectors (primarily agriculture) and the development
of complementary infrastructure, including feeder roads (particularly con-
necting the Hills to the Terai), communications and hydroelectric power.
Preparation of projects in irrigation, forestry, telecommunications, power
and rural development is underway.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Development Strategy and Manpower Implications
22.       Over the past decade, the shortage of trained technical manpower
to implement development projects has been an important factor which has
prevented the Government from achieving projected rates of growth in GDP.
Success in implementing the current Fifth and future Five-Year Plans will
require, inter alia, that steps be taken to alleviate these technical man-
power constraints, particularly of junior and senior engineering technicians.
23.       The shortage of senior engineering technicians (diploma level)
is exemplified by the existence of about 80 vacancies for technical staff
in the major government departments concerned with development projects.
The National Planning Commission's technical manpower requirement estimates
for the whole economy during the Fifth Plan, discounted to reflect effective
employment opportunities, indicate that an additional 1,100 senior techni-
cians, and 2,700 junior technicians (certificate level), will be needed over
the period 1976-8On  Manpower requirements for the Sixth Plan period (1981-85)
are conservatively estimated to increase by about 4% per annum.
24.       There is no local capacity in Nepal for training senior engineering
technicians. Almost all of the 780 senior engineering technicians in Nepal
in 1975 were trained abroad, usually under government or bilateral scholar-
ships. The number of places available for Nepalese diploma students at for-
eign institutions (mainly in India) has fluctuated widely and has been de-
clining in recent years. The estimated number of returning graduates through
1980 represents less than half of the projected needs for the current Plan
period. In addition, foreign training is not specifically related to
Nepalese conditions and problems, and foreign-trained technicians are



-7-
generally reluctant to work outside the Kathmandu Valley. Junior engineering
technicians are currently being trained locally, but the quality of training
is poor and the number of graduates is insufficient to meet demand.
The Education System
25.       The acute manpower shortages in technical fields reflect the his-
torical neglect of education in Nepal. At the end of the Rana regime (1951),
which opposed schooling of the general population, less than 1% of the school
age population (only 10,000 children) were in school. Since then, however,
enrollments have expanded rapidly. In 1976, 19% of the population over six
years of age (1.3 million) were literate, about 60% of children of the relevant
age group were enrolled in primary schools, and 21,400 students were enrolled
at the undergraduate level in Tribhuvan University.
26.       This significant progress was achieved under the New Education System
Plan (NESP) which the Government adopted in 1971 to help overcome the deficien-
cies in the education system. The major thrusts of the NESP were to enlarge
access to basic education, improve teacher training and reorient education
away from academic and theoretical subjects towards practical activities more
closely related to the needs of development. Education administration was
decentralized and the Government assumed greater responsibility for educational
financing.
27.       Despite this progress, and although the structural and administra-
tive aspects of the NESP have been largely implemented, Nepal's educational
problems are still far from solved. Enrollment targets have been only par-
tially met, trained teachers and textbooks are in short supply and dropout
rates are high. While expenditures on technical/vocational education have
increased, the demand for technical manpower is still largely unmet.
28.       As part of the NESP, primary education was shortened from five
years to three, so that minimum learning skills could be provided to greater
numbers of children. Primary enrollments grew by 165% during 1971-76, reach-
ing about 60% of the relevant age group. The female enrollment ratio has
increased to 20%, but remains low compared to the 90% ratio for boys. Regional
enrollment disparities continue to be pronounced. Dropout rates are exception-
ally high, with less than 30% of entering students completing the three-year
cycle.
29.       Secondary education consists of two levels:  lower secondary (Grades
4-7) for 40% of the total number of students enrolled at the primary level;
and upper secondary (Grades 8-10) for 40% of the total enrolled at the lower
secondary level. Since 1971, the enrollment ratio has improved from 11% to
14% of the relevant age group in lower secondary (73% of the NESP target) and
from 6% to 10% in upper secondary schools (57% of target). As at the primary
level, the enrollment ratio of girls remains substantially less than that of
boys and there continues to be a pronounced disparity in enrollment ratios
between regions. Prevocational subjects have been introduced in recent years
at the lower secondary level (10% of instruction time), and vocational sub-
jects were introduced at the upper secondary level (20% in general and Sanskrit



- 8 -
high schools, and 40% in vocational high schools). Five vocational streams
are taught in upper secondary schools - agriculture, secretarial science,
education, home science and industrial arts. The quality of training suffers
from poor workshop/laboratory facilities, lack of equipment and inadequately
trained teachers. Enrollment in upper secondary vocational streams has
been limited by financial and staffing constraints.
30.       The key problem in secondary education as a whole is low achieve-
ment rates among students, especially at the upper level. In general, only
30-40% of Grade 10 students pass the examination for the School Leaving
Certificate. Even those who pass are poorly prepared for higher education
and often require remedial work in some subjects. Substantial improvements
have been made under the NESP to increase teachers' qualifications, but the
effects of this have not yet been reflected in examination results.
31.       Under the NESP, the post secondary (higher) education effort was
centered in Tribhuvan University and was divided into three principal seg-
ments commencing with Grade 11 -- certificate, diploma and degree. Each of
these segments has a minimum of two years duration. A key problem of higher
education is the uniformly low quality of preparation of incoming students.
Because of this, each level is often extended by one semester or year for
remedial training. In line with the NESP policy of emphasizing study in
technical fields, enrollments have shifted from the five general institutes
(e.g., humanities, law) and the education institute towards the other five
technical institutes (e.g., engineering, agriculture, medicine). Although
66 branch campuses have been established to spread higher education more
evenly throughout Nepal, the majority of enrollments remains in the Central
Region (72% in 1976/77).
32.       The Institute of Engineering (IOE, established within Tribhuvan
University in 1971) became responsible under the NESP for providing and/or
supervising technical/vocational training at almost all levels. The IOE's
principal activity has been training of junior technicians at the certificate
level, mainly at its central campus at Pulchowk, near Kathmandu. To meet
pressing manpower requirements for implementation of public investment pro-
grams, enrollments were sharply increased from 470 in 1976 to 1,000 in 1977.
Although both male and female students are eligible for admission to the
Institute, to date only a few women have enrolled in the certificate program
in engineering, and about 80 have enrolled for training in architectural
drawing. There is strong competition for admission due to excellent employ-
ment prospects for graduates. Because of the poor academic preparation of
students, however, only 37% passed the final examination in 1976. The cer-
tificate level training at the IOE includes courses in civil and electrical
engineering and architectural drafting. The time devoted to practical work
is less than the amount desirable. This is largely a reflection of the
limited workshop/laboratory facilities and equipment at Pulchowk. Although
the IOE's staff have been adequate in numbers, they lack practical experience
and have diverse educational backgrounds, most having been trained abroad in
the USSR, India and Europe. This makes it difficult to achieve a consistent
teaching program appropriate to Nepalese conditions.

33.       Skilled worker training in Nepal is limited - eight training centers
produce a total of less than 300 skilled workers per year. Mechanical and
electrical trades, carpentry and crafts are taught. Dropout rates are high
as most students who meet the entrance requirement (an upper secondary level
education) still represent an elite group and, therefore, do not like to pur-
sue manual occupations. Previously, students without upper secondary educa-
tion were admitted and had a lower dropout rate, but were found to have
academic difficulties.
34.       The Department of Cottage and Village Industries has offered non-
formal rural skill training to rural families since 1966 at ten centers (four
for women, six for men). The three-day to six-month courses are offered in
knitting and sewing, cotton weaving, carpentry, and mechanical and electrical
fitting. The courses are free, and some financial assistance is available to
enable graduates to practice the skills acquired.
Government Strategy for Educational Development
35.       There are three main priorities for development of education in
Nepal:  (i) to expand basic education, especially for girls, and to reinforce
literacy skills learned in school; (ii) to improve the quality of instruction
at all levels, particularly at the upper secondary and junior technician
levels; and (iii) to strengthen the quality and expand the output of tech-
nical training and thereby provide the manpower needed for development.
36.       These are addressed by the Government in its objectives for the
development of education under the Fifth Plan (1976-80). About 10.5% of the
total Fifth Plan allocation has been devoted to education, representing a
doubling of the Fourth Plan allocation. The largest single item is for ex-
pansion of primary education (by 300,000 students) and the largest portion
of the allocation to higher education would be focused on the development
of six technical institutes, including engineering. Overall enrollments in
higher education would stabilize and there would be a major shift from the
general to the technical institutes.
37.       Although Nepal has received external assistance for education from
many sources, aid will need to be increased in order to meet the Fifth Plan
targets, particularly in the area of technical education. Past aid has been
in such areas as fellowships, women's teacher training, curricula and mate-
rials development, textbook production, skill training, radio education,
agricultural education and medical training. Donors include Canada, the
United Kingdom, India, the United States, the USSR, UNDP, UNICEF and Unesco.
In addition, the Asian Development Bank recently approved a project to
assist in the establishment of a regional training center (mainly trade
level) in the Eastern Development Region.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
38.       The proposed project was prepared by the Government with assistance
provided under the Unesco/IBRD Cooperative Program which sent a project prep-
aration mission to Nepal in July/August 1976. The mission's report was issued
in October 1976. The project was discussed with donors at the Aid Group meet-
ing in Tokyo in December 1976, and the United Kingdom's Ministry of Overseas
Development (ODM) expressed preliminary interest. After review, however, ODM
officials indicated that funds available were inadequate to finance the capital
components of the proposed project, but th,at nnM would be interested in fund-
ing the technical assistance components. Thus, in light of the importance of
the project to the success of development efforts in Nepal and the increasing
priority assigned by the Government to the sector, IDA decided that the pro-
posed project should be considered for an IDA credit. A preappraisal mission
visited Nepal in June/July 1977, followed by an appraisal mission in November
1977. Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C., during January 23-27, 1978.
The Government delegation was led by Mr. G. N. Rimal, Dean, Institute of
Engineering. Annex III of this report contains supplementary project data. A
report entitled "Nepal - Staff Appraisal Report for a Technical Education
Project (No. 1772b-NEP)" is being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors.
A. Project Objectives and Scope
39.       The proposed project is aimed at increasing the supply of junior
and senior engineering technicians needed to implement Nepal's development
programs. This would be achieved by increasing the capacity and quality of
training of the main campus (Pulchowk) of the Institute of Engineering (IOE)
of Tribhuvan University. The two principal objectives of the project would
be to:
(a) through provision of facilities, equipment, and technical
assistance, strengthen the quality of existing teaching pro-
grams for (i) about 1,000 students at the certificate level
(Grades 11-12; primarily in civil and electrical engineering,
and architectural drafting) and (ii) about 2nn students for
six-month remedial courses; and
(b) through provision of facilities, equipment, and technical
assistance, establish a new teaching program in civil
engineering for about 430 students at the diploma level
(Grades 13-15). 1/
1/   Because of the technical nature of the course and the generally poor
academic background of students, the diploma course would be three
years rather than the usual two years for other diploma courses within
Tribhuvan University.



- 11 -
The Institute of Engineering (IOE)
40.       Equipment and Facilities.  The project would provide additional
classrooms, laboratories, workshops, a library and a canteen/dining hall.
Because of inadequate accommodation in the Kathmandu Valley, boarding facil-
ities would be provided for about 560 students coming from outside the Valley.
As an incentive to help the Institute recruit and retain qualified staff,
housing for about 30 staff would be included to accommodate administrators,
department heads and about half the diploma level teaching staff. Teaching
equipment for laboratories and workshops would be provided, as well as teach-
ing materials (books and jo-urnals)-_  v-or economica1 operation, the facilities
and equipment provided would, in general, be used by both the certificate and
diploma level programs. About 60% of total project costs, excluding technical
assistance, could be attributed to the certificate program and 40% to the
diploma program.
41.       Enrollments.  The project aims at quality improvement of certificate
level training, which could not easily be achieved while enrollments continue
to increase. Assurances were, therefore, obtained from the Government that:
(i) the combined enrollments of Grades 11 and 12 of the IOE at Pulchowk would
be held at the 1977 level (1,000) throughout implementation unless jointly
reviewed in advance with the Association (Section 3.12(a) of the Development
Credit Agreement) 1/; and (ii) any Government plan to establish additional
certificate level engineering programs at other campuses should be jointly
reviewed in advance with the Association (Section 3.12(b) of the Development
Credit Agreement). A six-month remedial program would also be instituted
under the project with an enrollment of about 200 students to strengthen their
background in science, mathematics and language prior to their entering Grade
11. By 1983, 220 students would be enrolled in the remedial program, 500 in
Grade 11, and 480 in Grade 12.
42.       A diploma level program would be established under the project be-
ginning in 1978 with the admission of 25 students to Grade 13, increasing
to 150 in 1981. Allowing for dropout rates of 10% per year, a total of 400
students would be enrolled in the diploma course in 1983.
43.       Admission Policy.  In order to increase enrollments of students
from remote areas, applicants from designated districts are given extra points
on the entrance examination for the certificate program. The Government has
agreed that applicants admitted to the diploma level after January 1981
would be required to have had at least one year of prior related work expe-
rience (Section 3.10 of the Development Credit Agreement).
1/  During negotiations an understanding was reached that in view of the
intense pressure on the IOE to increase enrollments in response to the
acute manpower shortage, a temporary increase in enrollments to 1,200
would be acceptable to the Association until such a time as the 200
additional students could be accommodated at another campus of the
Institute.



- 12 -
44.       Teaching Programs.  At the certificate level, the program would
provide training primarily in civil and electrical engineering and architec-
tural drafting. The diploma level program would be limited to civil engineer-
ing. At both the certificate and diploma levels, emphasis would be placed on
solving engineering problems frequently encountered in Nepal. A considerable
proportion of instruction time would, therefore, be devoted to practical work
in laboratories and workshops (designated at 45% at the diploma level, and
increased from the present about 40% to about 55% at the certificate level).
Curricula would be revised and developed with the assistance of specialists
to be provided under the technical assistance to be financed by the Overseas
Development Ministry (ODM) of the United Kingdom (para. 47). The content of
teaching programs would be based on an analysis of the present and projected
skills required of junior and senior technicians by government agencies. New
courses would make use of problems and case material drawn from experience
with Nepalese development projects.
45.       Staff Recruitment.  Under the project, the IOE, which at present
has a staff of 85, would need to recruit 118 new staff members, including
replacements. Recruitment would be phased over four years, through 1981,
and would include 48 graduates, 48 nongraduates and 22 laboratory technicians.
Recruitment of teaching staff for the certificate level program should not
present a problem in view of the IOE's recent success in employment of addi-
tional staff and the projected number of returning graduates. Recruitment of
teaching staff for the diploma level program is expected to be more difficult,
but will be eased by the incentives offered in the forms of fellowships (para.
46) and housing (para. 40). Salaries offered by the IOE are competitive with
other employers of engineering graduates in Nepal. Assurances were obtained
from the Government that student/teacher ratios would be maintained at 10:1
and 9:1 for the certificate and diploma programs, respectively (Section 3.11
of the Development Credit Agreement), which are appropriate, and that adequate
funds would be provided for this purpose.
46.       Staff Training.  The proposed project would include about 53 man-
years of staff training to be financed by the ODM technical assistance pro-
gram. This would include study tours of similar institutions in both develop-
ing and advanced countries for IOE administrators. Training of teaching staff
would focus on curriculum development, teaching methods and, where appropriate
and feasible, acquisition of industrial experience. The fellowship program
would be phased over four years to ensure adequate coverage of administration
and teaching programs. A fellowship committee has been organized, and spe-
cific procedures and selection criteria have been established to ensure that
selection of staff for training is in accordance with project objectives. The
recipients of fellowships would be bonded to IOE upon their return for a spe-
cified period of time in accordance with the duration of their fellowship.
47.       Specialists' Services.  Also provided under the proposed project
would be about 16 man-years of expatriate specialists' services to be financed
by ODM. These services and staff training (para. 46) would be provided through



- 13 -
a linkage with a well-established technical institute in the United Kingdom 1/
and would be phased over the four-year implementation period (1978-82). The
specialists, together with their Nepalese counterparts, would: (i) evaluate
and develop teaching programs; (ii) help prepare detailed teaching manuals;
(iii) help train staff to teach the course content effectively; and (iv) assist
in the procurement, installation, and operation of equipment. Assurances have
been obtained from the Government that: (i) terms of reference and qualifica-
tions of the specialists would be acceptable to the Association (Section 3.09
(a) of the Development Credit Agreement); and (ii) that additional specialists'
services would be sought after completion of the project as may be required to
achieve fully and to maintain the objectives of the project (Section 3.09(b)
of the Development Credit Agreement).
48.       Project Output.  The number of certificates awarded yearly by the
IOE is projected to increase from 120 to about 420 in 1979, 300 of which would
be in civil engineering. Output at the diploma level is expected to start
at about 20 in 1981, increasing to 100 in 1984. These graduates are expected
to have no trouble obtaining employment in their fields (para. 55).
49.       Related Studies.  In conjunction with the proposed project, the
Government would conduct three studies on key issues in education in Nepal
to provide the basis for future development of the sector. The three studies
would examine: (i) primary education with emphasis on female participation
and retention rates; (ii) trade level skills, developing a plan for rational-
izing trade training on a national basis and designing the content and delivery
system of a rural skill training program; and (iii) the need for establishing
a trade and certificate level engineering institute in the Western Development
Region. Outside sources of funding for these studies are being sought. Assur-
ances have been obtained that the Government would provide or cause to be
provided the funds necessary to carry out the studies by June 30, 1979, under
terms of reference acceptable to the Association (Section 3.13 of the Devel-
opment Credit Agreement).
B. Project Costs and Financing
50.       The total project would cost US$7.8 million equivalent of which
ODM would finance 14% (US$1.1 million) for technical assistance, IDA 73%,
and the Government 13%. The project cost includes physical contingencies of
US$490,000 and price contingencies of US$1.3 million. The proposed IDA credit
of US$5.7 million equivalent would finance US$4.4 million in foreign exchange
and US$1.3 million of local costs. The remaining US$1.0 million of local costs
would be met by the Government, which would also finance all annual recurrent
costs. The improvement of the existing certificate program is not expected
to increase annual recurrent costs from their present level of less than
NRs 4,000 per student. However, the new diploma program is expected to gene-
rate incremental annual recurrent costs of about NRs 1.8 million in 1983 (in
1/   Paisley College of Technology, near Glasgow, Scotland.



- 14 -
1977 prices), about NRs 4,200 per student, which represents less than 1% of
the Government's 1977 budget for recurrent educational expenditures.
C. Project Implementation
51.       A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has already been established
at the IOE, Pulchowk Campus and will be maintained with an adequate number
of qualified staff until September 30, 1983, the closing date of the project
(Section 3.06 of the Development Credit Agrement). Funding for adequate
facilities and supporting staff would be provided under the project. The PIU
staff would be assisted in its responsibilities by consultant architects and
engineers financed under the project with qualifications and terms of reference
acceptable to IDA (Section 3.02 of the Development Credit Agreement) and by an
equipment and curriculum specialist financed by ODM. All key project staff
and the consultant architects have been appointed and the campus master plan,
all sketch plans, and the equipment lists of major items for all the engineer-
ing laboratories have been prepared. Assurances have been obtained from the
Government that: (i) monitoring and evaluation systems would be established
by December 31, 1979, and summary reports provided annually to IDA during the
project implementation period, and for five years thereafter (Section 3.07
of the Development Credit Agreement); (ii) a draft completion report would be
provided to the Association by the Closing Date (Section 3.04(c) of the Devel-
opment Credit Agreement); and (iii) a maintenanre and repair workshop would
be established and maintained with properly trained personnel (Section 3.08
of the Development Credit Agreement).
D. Procurement and Disbursement
52.       Total civil works for the project would cost about US$3.3 million
including professional services and contingencies. Because of the relatively
small size of contracts which are unlikely to be attractive to foreign bidders
(estimated at below US$600,000), contracts for civil works would be awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally following government pro-
cedures which are satisfactory to the Association. Foreign and locally estab-
lished foreign firms would be allowed to participate. IDA's prior approval
would be required for any civil works contract exceeding US$200,000 equivalent.
53.       Furniture and equipment for the project would total about US$3.2
million including contingencies. Contracts for this category exceeding
US$50,000 equivalent would be awarded after IDA approval on the basis of
international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank Group guide-
lines. In bid comparison, domestic manufacturers would be allowed a prefer-
ential margin of 15% or the existing customs duty, whichever is lower, over
the c.i.f. price of competing imports. Equipment and furniture would be pack-
aged reasonably to allow bulk procurement. Equipment and furniture purchases
which cannot reasonably be grouped to form contracts for at least US$50,000
equivalent and aggregating a total of less than US$350,000, could be awarded



- 15 -
without prior IDA approval on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally, following government procedures satisfactory to the Association.
Books and journals (amounting to about US$0.2 million including contingen-
cies) would be purchased directly from publishers and authorized distributors.
In addition, off-the-shelf items, not exceeding US$10,000 equivalent in each
contract and aggregating a maximum of US$50,000 equivalent, could be purchased
on the basis of a minimum of three price quotations.
54.       The proposed credit would be disbursed on the basis of: (i) 100%
of foreign expenditures for directly imported teaching materials, equipment
and furniture; (ii) 100% of lznl  xpend5itures (ex-factory) for locally manu-
factured teaching materials, equipment and furniture; (iii) 65% of the cost
of imported teaching materials, equipment and furniture procured locally; (iv)
75% of the expenditures on civil works; and (v) 100% of the cost of technical
and engineering services and professional fees.
E. ProJect Benefits and Risks
55.       The principal benefit of the proposed project would be in helping
to eliminate one of the critical bottlenecks to implementation of development
plans in Nepal - the shortage of engineering technicians. Under the project,
the quality of the existing certificate level training would be improved and
the graduates would meet about 5Q% of est4mated requ4rements for junior tech-
nicians in the Fifth Plan, and about 85% in the Fifth and Sixth Plans combined.
Diploma level output would meet 30% of the expected demand for civil engineers
in the Sixth Plan, and the remaining requirements would be met by diploma
holders returning from abroad and by those promoted from certificate level.
Through the establishment of local diploma level training capacity, the pro-
posed project would minimize the present dependence on foreign diploma level
training, which is unreliable (positions for Nepalese students have been de-
clining in recent years), and, most importantly, is generally unrelated to
Nepals unusual conditions. Additionally, analysis has shown local training
to be considerably less expensive than sending Nepalese students abroad,
when taking into account the weighted average cost of all foreign institu-
tions presently providing such training. A further benefit of the project
would be the reinforcement of government strategy to redirect higher educa-
tion resources along productive lines needed for develonment.
56.       Achievement of project objectives would depend mainly on two factors.
The first is that, under pressure of acute manpower shortages and a high number
of applications, the Government might expand enrollments of IOE more rapidly
than envisaged under the project and thus jeopardize the objective of achiev-
ing reasonable quality standards. Assurances have been obtained from the
Government that expansion will be limited (para. 41). Another possible risk
associated with the proposed project is that there would be a tendency of the
IOE to maintain, or revert to, a theoretical, rather than the intended prac-
tical, emphasis in instruction. Specific measures, such as required work
experience (para. 43), have been introduced into the project to help prevent



- 16 -
this, but this factor would need to be kept under close review during imple-
mentation. On the whole these potential risks have been minimized through
project design and are offset by the potentially strong benefit of reducing
the shortage of engineering technicians.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
57.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of Nepal
and the Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
58.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III. A condition of effectiveness is that all conditions precedent
to the effectiveness of the United Kingdom grant for technical assistance
have been fulfilled (Section 6.01 of the Development Credit Agreement).
59.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
60.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   Projects in Execution 1/
Credit No. 373 - Birgani Irrigation Project US$6.0 million Credit of
April 18, 1973; Effective Date: July 9, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
Implementation of the project is progressing satisfactorily after
initial delays in appointing engineering consultants, in field surveys and in
procurement. More than half of the credit amount has been disbursed. Civil
works are being completed in three irrigation biocks and contracts have been
awarded for another three (out of the original total of twelve). Construction
of tubewells is 70% completed in the groundwater areas. Irrigation operations
started in 1976 from nine tubewells, and in 1977, in the first surface irriga-
tion block. Due to a 50% cost overrun, a reduction in the project area to
include only six blocks has been agreed. The project is expected to be com-
pleted by mid-1979.
Credit No. 397 - Telecommunications Project II US$5.5 million Credit of
June 20, 1973; Effective Date: September 11, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30. 1980
Due to organizational problems, lack of continuity in senior manage-
ment, and delay in obtaining expert assistance, there have been delays in
procurement and tLe project is more than one year ueuLnu  schedule.  Good
progress is now being made with the assistance of experts and consultants
provided by the United Kingdom and a new General Manager has been appointed.
The project is now proceeding satisfactorily and present estimates are for
completion of works by early 1980, some twelve months behind schedule.
Credit No. 470 - Water Supply and Sewerage Project US$11.8 million Credit of
May 8, 1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978; Revised Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Design work is complete and most of the major contracts have now
been let. Project implementation is about one year behind schedule, because
of delays in letting the contracts. A management team of four experts pro-
vided by the United Kingdom has been assisting the Water Supply and Sewerage
Board.  Work is now progressing satisfactorily.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the projects in execution and, in particular, to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken. They should
be used in this sense on the understanding that they do not purport
to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weakness in project
execution.

Credit No. 505 - Settlement Project US$6.0 million Credit of August 14, 1974;
Effective Date:  February 20, 1975; Closing Date:  July 15,
1982
Project implementation is two years behind schedule. While equip-
ment has been procured and land clearing has started, overall progress remains
slow. This is partly due to lack of management and planning capacity by pro-
ject agencies and partly to change of Government priorities and land use
policies. The latter are expected to lead to a request to reduce project
size by about 40%. The Government and IDA have agreed upon land clearing
targets for the 1977/78 season. However, if these are not attained and if
progress remains unsatisfactory, restructuring or discontinuation of this
project may have to be considered both by the Government and the Association.
Credit No. 600 - Kulekhani Hydroelectric Project US$26.0 million Credit of
January 9, 1976; Effective Date: May 18. 1976; Closing
Date: December 31. 1981
The main civil works contract has been awarded and bids for all
major plant and equipment have been received and are being evaluated. The
revised estimate of project costs is now US$112 million which is some 64%
higher than the estimate of US$68 million at the time of appraisal. The
increases in costs are due to a number of factors, principally the poor
response for the civil works contract and the risk factors inherent in a
major project which is remotely located. These are reflected in higher bid
prices and implementation delays which are adding to costs. All main con-
tracts are being placed. Discussions are planned with other co-lenders to
explore possible sources of supplementary funds to bridge the financing
gap.
Credit No. 617 - Rural Development Project US$8.0 million Credit of
April 30, 1976; Effective Date: July 16, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31. 1981
Progress continues to be satisfactory, with almost all planned pro-
ject actions being implemented ahead of schedule. Inter-ministerial coopera-
tion is good and, at the district level, sound and practical development plans
have been produced which are tully supported and understood by project farmers.
Adequate financing to carry out project proposals has been made available in
the budget by the Government and sites and plans for most district construc-
tion projects have been completed and construction started. Training of
weavers and issuance of improved looms under a credit scheme is proceeding
well. Shortage of middle-level staff in the project area for construction
supervision and agricultural extension may hinder project implementation.
However, arrangements have been made for more efficient deployment of exist-
ing staff and for special training of farmers as part-time agricultural
assistants. Under the associated Bank executed UNDP technical assistance
project, the assistant to the Project Coordinator, the Irrigation Advisor,
and the advisor to the Project Evaluation Unit have taken up their posts.

TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROJECT
Supplementary Project Data Sheet
Section I: Timetable of Key Events
(a)  Time taken to prepare the project
The project was identified by the Unesco/IBRD Cooperative
Program during a mission to Nepal in July/August 1976. It
was prepared during August-October 1976.
(b) Agency preparing the project
The project was prepared by the Government with assistance
from the Unesco/IBRD Cooperative Program.
(c) Date of first presentation to IDA and date of first mission
to consider the project
The project was first presented to IDA in October 1976. At
the December 1976 meeting of the Aid Coordination Group in
Tokyo, IDA suggested to the Government that ODM be approached
for financing, rather than to add a new sector to IDA's oper-
ations. After review, however, ODM indicated that it had
insufficient funds to finance the capital components of the
project, but expressed interest in the technical assistance
components. Thus, IDA decided to finance the capital compo-
nents and sent its first mission to Nepal in June/July 1977.
(d) Date of departure of appraisal mission
October 1977
(e) Date of completion of negotiations
January 27, 1978
(f) Planned date of effectiveness
