APPRAISAL OF A TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROJECT
1. DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY AND MANPOWER IMPLICATIONS
Development Pattern and Strategy
1.01      Nepal's development efforts to date have been directed toward the
establishment of basic infrastructure (e.g., irrigation, power, transportation,
communications) and supporting institutions (e.g., agricultural extension and
research, financial institutions, trading corporations, national construction
company, industrial estates). Implementation of development projects has
been only partly achieved, as is evident from Table 1.1. The Nepalese
attribute these shortfalls in plan achievement essentially to three factors:
(a) difficult topographical conditions with which civil engineers must contend;
(b) unreliable supplies of basic raw materials and building materials; and
(c) a shortage of qualified administrative, supervisory, and technical
manpower, particularly civil engineers, at all levels. In addition, the
targets were ambitious and the readiness of projects for implementation
during the plan period was overestimated.

1.02      These implementation rates are not notably lower than those of most
developing countries, but in the past decade, Nepal's GDP grew at an annual
rate of only 2.4% in real terms, which is only slightly above the annual
growth rate of population (2.2%). The Fourth Plan (1971-75) achieved only a
2.2% annual growth in GDP. The current (Fifth) plan (1976-80) aims at a GDP
growth rate of 4-5% annually (minimum and maximum plan) and expects significant
economic benefits from past expansion of infrastructure.

The targets under the Fifth Plan show a shift in emphasis from transportation
and communication to agriculture, industry, and the social sectors, i.e.,
from physical to social infrastructure and to projects with immediate benefits
in agriculture and industry. More emphasis is placed on: (a) small irrigation
schemes with quick returns that would increase grain production; and (b) grad-
ual development of small-scale manufacturing industries, including handicraft
and cottage industries which already contribute about 7% to GDP and employ
about 15% of the labor force. Some major targets of development projects
under the maximum plan are shown below.

- 3-
The physical targets of the Fifth Plan are ambitious in view of actual
achievements during the Fourth Plan. To achieve them the Government must,
inter alia, introduce measures to alleviate the technical manpower constraints
which were an important factor contributing to underimplementation of the
Fourth Plan (para. 1.01).

Only 0.5% of the labor force, or 25,000 persons, were categorized as "pro-
fessional, technical and related workers," of whom 23,000 were engaged in the
services sector (government, community or personal).
1.05      There are indicators of deficiencies in particular skills.  The
shortage of senior engineering technicians is evident from the 80 vacancies in
the major government departments concerned with development projects (see
Table 1.5). These posts comprise:
(a) District Engineers, who are given the responsibility for design
and supervision of local development works (e.g. construction
and maintenance of district roads, irrigation projects, etc.)
and for advising Local Development Boards on engineering aspects of
a development project;
(b) Road Section Engineers, who are responsible for the upkeep and
maintenance of national roads (about 1,800 km of paved and
gravel roads);



- 4 -
(c) Site (Road and Building) Supervision Engineers, employed at the
construction site; and
(d) Headquarters Engineers, who are mainly involved with planning of
physical facilities ranging from individual building units to
town or area planning; their work also includes estimating costs
and preparation of tender documents, and preparatory work for
implementation of construction wDrk.
Almost all senior technicians, about 780 in 1975, were trained abroad,
since diploma courses are not available locally.

/a Junior technicians (certificate level) are employed in various activities
that require less specialization, mainly assisting senior technicians.
Junior technicians working under the supervision of the District Engineers
have elementary skill training covering a wide range, including construction
work, metal work, electrical installations, rural sociology, and leadership
training. Small road sections are assigned to "overseers" (certificate
holders) who report actual damage or potential problem areas to the Road
Section Engineer.

engineers.

1.06      In developing its estimates of technical manpower requirements for
the whole economy during the Fifth Plan, the National Planning Commission (NPC)
adopted a straightforward "project approach." Each government department
submitted the number of unfilled, authorized positions at the end of the
Fourth Plan, and an estimate of incremental manpower needs to implement the
investment program of the Fifth Plan. These estimates were accepted at face
value by the NPC and then aggregated. However, the NPC projections are
considered unrealistic since it is unlikely that all the investment programs
will be fully implemented./l Furthermore, the incremental manpower estimates
submitted by government departments are believed to be exaggerated due to
their previous experience in having their estimates reduced by the Ministry of
Finance. In consequence of this overestimation and the arbitrary nature of
the private sector estimates, (an additional 10% of senior technicians and 20%
of junior technicians over the estimated needs in the public sector), the NPC
estimates have been factored by 30% to better reflect effective employment
opportunities for senior and junior technicians (see Table 1.6).

during the Fifth Plan will be between 3.2 and 3.7% a year, which is
about 70% of the targeted growth rate. (See the Review of the Economic
Situation of Nepal, July 22, 1976, p. 29, Report No. 1180-NEP.)

The estimated number of returnees represents only 45% of the projected needs,
and the overall trend (Table 1.8) in the number of places available for Nepalese
diploma students at foreign institutions (mainly in India) is declining and
fluctuates considerably from year to year. Therefore, the Government cannot
depend on a sufficient number of students being trained abroad each year.

Training outside Nepal is general in scope and not specifically related
to Nepalese conditions and problems.  Moreover it is difficult to assign
engineers trained abroad to work outside the Kathmandu Valley.
1.08      The Government has not yet considered development plans and manpower
requirements beyond the present Plan. In the absence of such projections, it
would be reasonable to assume that the requirements for both senior and
junior technicians during the Sixth Plan (1981-85) would be 20% higher than
during the Fifth Plan. This increase (about 4% p.a.) is low in comparison
with the 140% and 188% increases assumed for senior and junior technicians
respectively during the Fifth Plan period.

1.09      The planned establishment of diploma level courses would not
produce graduates until the Sixth Plan; accordingly, annual deficits of
senior technicians for the period 1976-85 are projected to be about 20.
Without additional investment in diploma level training, the annual deficit
would be about 50. The development of a reliable local technical training
capacity is essential to ensure the availability of manpower to implement
the Government's investment programs.
2. THE EDUCATION SYSTEM /1
Overview of Educational Development
2.01      The acute manpower shortages being experienced in technical fields
reflect the historical neglect in developing Nepalese education. At the end
of the Rana regime (1951), which opposed schooling of the general population,
/1 See Chart I for Administrative Structure of the Education System and Chart 2
for Structure of the Education System.

only 10,000 children were in school, less than 1% of the school age population.
Fewer than 2% of the population were literate. From the early 1950s onwards,
education has been expanding at a rapid rate, as shown in Table 2.1. The
literate population has risen to 1.3 million, 19% of the population over six
years of age in 1976. Primary school enrollment amounted to 59% of the
relevant age group. In addition, the Tribhuvan University had a total of
21,400 students at the undergraduate level.

-9-
2.02      By the early 1970s, it had- become clear that this rapidly expanding
education system had a number of serious shortcomings. The participation of
women in education was lagging. The literacy rate of females was 4% as
compared to 24% for males; the primary enrollment ratio for girls was 9% as
compared to about 40% for boys. More than two thirds of the teaching force
were untrained. The content of education tended to be too theoretical.
In higher education almost all enrollments were concentrated in the fields of
liberal arts and humanities; little attention was being paid to training in
the kinds of technical skills most needed for growth and development.
2.03      In 1971, the Government introduced fundamental changes to help over-
come these deficiencies in its education system. The Government adopted the
New Education System Plan (NESP) to enlarge access to basic education and
relate education more closely to the needs of development. The NESP reduced
the length of primary education from five to three years so that minimum
learning skills could be provided to greater numbers of children. Secondary
education was divided into two levels: lower secondary (Grades 4-7) for 40%
of the total number of students enrolled in primary schools; and upper
secondary (Grades 8-10) for 40% of the total number of students enrolled in
lower secondary. Under the reform, more resources were made available for
teacher training. A major thrust of the NESP was to reorient education
away from academic and theoretical subjects towards practical activities.
Compulsory vocational courses were introduced in all upper secondary
schools, ranging from 20% of instruction time in general upper secondary
schools (404 schools) to 40% in vocational schools (116 schools). All
post-secondary education was assigned to Tribhuvan University and was
divided into the following three segments: certificate (Grades 11-12);
diploma (Grades 13-14); and degree (Grades 15-16), each with a minimum of
two years. Institutes under the university became responsible for related
training at precertificate levels. Skill training outside the formal
education system was largely consolidated under the technical institutes of
the university. Specifically, the Institute of Engineering (IOE) became
responsible for providing some, and supervising nearly all, skilled worker
training. Another major characteristic of the reform was decentralization
of educational administration to 4 regional directorates and 75 district
education offices. In addition, government policy included steps to reduce
the concentration of higher education in Kathmandu by opening branch
campuses of higher institutes in the Eastern, Western, and Far Western
Regions. The NESP also increased the responsibility of the Government for
educational financing. Teachers' salaries were increased and the Government
assumed payment of teachers' salaries, an expense previously borne by local
communities, in the following proportions: primary, 100%; lower secondary,
75%; upper secondary, 50%. Curricula have been revised at all levels.
2.04      The structural and administrative aspects of the NESP have been
largely implemented, but the quantitative expansion is only beginning to
gain momentum. It will take several years for the planned measures to
affect the deeply rooted educational problems. According to the NESP, two
thirds of the 6-8 age group were to be enrolled by 1976, compared with



- 10 -
25% in 1971. The actual figure was about 59%, ranging from 38% in remote
districts to 70% in Kathmandu, and from 20% for girls to about 90% for boys.
The auality of education is stilL adversely affected by the scarcity of text-
books and trained teachers.  Only 30-40% of the students enrolled in Grade 10
pass the final examination for the School Leaving Certificate (SLC). The
financial priorities of the NESP increased the low proportion of public
exDenditures devoted to education from about 7% to 10%.  These resources,
however, tend not to be used eff-Lciently, as evidenced by high dropout rates:
less than 30% of those entering primary schools complete the cycle. WIhile
expenditures on technical/vocational education have increased, urgent needs
for senior and junior technical manpower are still unmet.
The Education Svstem by Level
2.05      Primary Education.  The shortening of primary education from five
to three years has reduced the cost of primary education and therefore
has made the achievement of universal primary schooling more feasible.
Primary enrollments grew by 165% during 1971-76 from 243,000 to 644,000,
reaching about 60% of the total age group and exceeding the target by about
50,000 students. This achievement is significant. The percentage of girl
students also increased from 16% in 1971 to 20% in 1976, but is still low by
international standards. Regional enrollment disparities also remained
pronounced, ranging from 38% in the Far West to 70% in Kathmandu.
2.06      There is some doubt that permanent numeracy and literacy can
be achieved in just three years of schooling, particularly under poor con-
ditions and in an environment predominantly conditioned to illiteracy.
TUnless numeracy and literacy skills achieved through primary education are
reinforced by use they are easily lost. Moreover, despite enrollment
increases, dropout rates have been exceptionally high: about 65% between
the first two grades and about 22% between Grades 2 and 3. Consequently,
less than 30% of initial entrants to primary schools complete the three-
year cycle. Possible causes of dropouts are opportunity costs (the need
of child labor for parents), direct costs to parents and in-school factors
such as noor facilities, lack of training materials /1 and inadequately
trained teachers /2 unable to motivate students and parents. Extended
coverage at the primary level would be facilitated by a policy directed
at increasing female enrollments and overall retention rates. Such a
policy is made difficult by the lack of research into the causes and poss-
ible solutions to these two probhLems.
2.07      Secondary Education.   The target enrollment in the NESP was
237,000 for lower secondary (Grades 4-7) and 118,000 for upper secondary
(Grades 8-10). At the end of the Fourth Plan period in 1975, 73% of the
/1 Textbooks are in short supply although the policy of the Government is
to distribute them free in 18 poor districts and to needy boys and all
girls in remaining districts..
/2 Only about 40% of primary teachers are trained to the SLC level.

lower secondary and 57% of the upper secondary target were achieved. Even
though the target was not achieved, the enrollment ratio of the relevant age
group has improved from 11% to 14% in lower secondary and from 6% to 10% in
upper secondary schools during the NESP period. There has been an increase
in girls' enrollment in secondary education, but their enrollment ratio is
still substantially less than that of boys:

Substantial disparity also exists by region, particularly the Far Western
Region at the upper secondary level, as follows:

2.08      A major aim of the NESP was to reorient the content of education
along practical lines. Prevocational subjects,/l amounting to 10% of instruc-
tional time, were introduced at the lower secondary level to improve the atti-
tudes of students to manual work. Vocational subjects are taught in upper
/1 In agriculture, bamboo, paper and pottery, and cooking.



- 12 -
secondary schools (20% in general high schools, 40% in vocational high
schools, and 20% in Sanskrit high schools). Five groups of vocational
subjects are given in upper secondary schools: (a) agriculture - agronomy,
horticulture, animal husbandry, and poultry streams; (b) secretarial science -
typing and shorthand, office management, and bookkeeping streams; (c) home
service; (d) industrial arts - furniture making, electrical work, metalwork,
bricklaying and building construction, and basketry streams; and (e) education.
Among the five vocational streams the most successful have been the agricultural,
secretarial science, and education groups.  The graduates from the agricultural
group are readily accepted as village extension workers; those from the secre-
tarial science group as typists, clerks, and bookkeepers; and most graduates
from the education group as primary school teachers. The home science and
industrial arts groups are not popular among students because of poor employ-
ment prospects. Because of poor workshop facilities, equipment and inadequately
trained teachers, moreover, the quality of vocational training programs has
suffered. Financial constraints and shortage of trained staff have limited
the total upper secondary enrollment in vocational streams to 22%, well below
the 60% target set in the Fifth Plan.
2.09      The key problem in secondary education, particularly at the upper
level, is low achievement rates among students. Although 60% of entering
students tend to remain in school for the secondary cycle (compared with only
30% for the primary cycle), they perform poorly on the terminal examination.
Over the last three years only 30-40% of Grade 10 students passed the exam-
ination for the SLC. Even students who did obtain the SLC were generally
poorly prepared for higher education and often required additional remedial
work. The causes of low academic achievement are cumulative and reflect the
traditional lack of facilities, teaching materials and poorly trained
staff. Substantial improvements have been made under the NESP to increase
teachers' qualifications./l The proportion of trained lower secondary
teachers almost tripled from 13% in 1971 to 38% in 1976, and over the same
period increased from 18% to 50% at the upper level. The effects of these
increases have not yet been reflected in examination results.
2.10      Higher Education.  Under the NESP all post-secondary education
was assigned to Tribhuvan University (Chart No. 4) and was divided into three
principal segments: certificate, diploma and degree, each with a minimum of
two years (para. 2.03). In practice, however, the poor academic background
of incoming students means that courses at certificate level are often extended
by one semester and by one year at diploma level for remedial training.
2.11      Tribhuvan University is composed of five general and six technical
institutes, each devoted to studies in a single field. The NESP policy to
emphasize study in technical fields has been successfully initiated over the
past five years. Between 1971 and 1976 there has been a shift in enrollments
away from the general and education institutes toward the other technical
institutes as shown in Table 2.4.
/1 Trained lower secondary school teachers are those who have completed the
certificate course and trained upper secondary school teachers are those
who have completed the diploma course at the Institute of Education or
its equivalent.

The Central Region had 72% of the 1976/77 enrollment, and the Far Western
Region only 7%. Some campuses (the smallest has only 46 students) should be
consolidated for reasons of economy and efficiency but this seems unlikely in
view of political pressure for building more branch campuses. As an alternative
to further regional expansion, admission preferences for all the university's
campuses are given to students who apply from outside the Kathmandu Valley,
supported by scholarships and loan schemes.
2.13      A key problem in higher education is the poor academic background
of entering students (para. 2.09). There has been a surfeit of applicants
with SLCs for admission to higher education, about 11,000 in 1977 for 5,900
places, but this competition has not led to higher admission standards because
of the uniformly low quality of preparation of incoming students. In addition,
there is a need in higher education to continue and accelerate the redirection
of enrollments toward technical fields to satisfy important, but unmet needs,
particularly for technicians (para. 1.02).
Technical Training under the Institute of Engineering (IOE)
2.14      Under the NESP, the IOE, established in 1971, became responsible
for providing or supervising technical/vocational training at all levels.
For example, in 1972, the Technical Training Section of the Department of
Cottage Industries was transferred to the IOE. In addition to its training at
the certificate level, the IOE also assumed administrative control of the few
institutions in Nepal giving skilled worker training.
2.15      Certificate Level.  The principal activity of the IOE has been
training of junior technicians at certificate level. The bulk of this
certificate training has been concentrated in its central campus at Pulchowk,
near Kathmandu. The certificate level training at IOE includes courses in
civil and electrical engineering and architectural drafting. Enrollments in
1972 and 1977 and estimated outputs are shown in Table 2.6.

To meet pressing manpower needs for implementation of the public investment
programs, enrollments were sharply increased from 470 in 1976 to 1,010 in
1977. Courses are open to both male and female students. However, female
students are few in number in engineering courses, but are attracted mainly to
the architectural drafting course (about 80 students).
2.16      Excellent employment prospects for graduates have contributed to
strong competition for admission. In 1977, 4,000 SLC-holders sought admis-
sion for 540 available places./l Still, the academic preparation of students
admitted was weak in mathematics, science and language. This weak preparation
is indicated in low examination pass rates. An average of only 37% of the
students passed the final examination in 1976. The average was 14% in one
subject for four classes selected at random; for one class of students,
all from remote areas, the pass rate was zero. A concerted effort is needed
to improve the quality of student performance, particularly in view of the
substantial enrollment expansion between 1976 and 1977. Remedial courses
in mathematics, science and language were begun in the 1977 winter semester
for students with inadequate preparation.

2.17      The curricula for the three existing certificate courses, civil
engineering, architectural drafting and electrical engineering, do not include
adequate laboratory work content. Curricula for the other two existing certi-
ficate courses, radio and electronics, and air conditioning and refrigeration,
do not include adequate workshop practice (see Table 2.7). Consequently,
the graduates lack the skills required to perform the jobs properly whether
employed for development projects or in industry. About one sixth of the
civil engineering course should be devoted to laboratory work (e.g. materials
testing, hydraulics and soil mechanics). The workshop practice content should
be tripled for the radio and electronics course and doubled for the air
conditioning and refrigeration course.

2.18      The lack of laboratory and practical work in the teaching program is
a reflection of the limited facilities available on the Pulchowk Campus. While
the Pulchowk Campus has 40 classrooms/drawing offices for the 1,000 students,
there are only 9 workshops and 4 laboratories, all poorly equipped, compared
with the 10 workshops and 22 laboratories needed for a teaching program with
about 45% of instruction time devoted to practical subjects for the diploma
course and about 55% for the certificate courses. Present workshops/labora-
tories also lack appropriately trained staff.
2.19      Staff of the IOE have been adequate in numbers for the certificate
level courses. The teaching staff of the Pulchowk Campus has increased from
27 in 1972 (a student:teacher ratio of 5:1) to 51 in 1975 and 85 in 1977
(12:1).  Certificate level teacher turnover has been insignificant because
the IOE salary scale is consisten,t with that of the main employer of engineers,
the Government. About 30% of the teaching staff have postgraduate degrees



- 17 -
and 30% graduate (i.e. bachelors) degrees. However, only 11% of the teaching
staff have ever had work experience (other than teaching) in the field of
orientation. This limits their ability to focus classroom instruction on
practical problems. Almost all graduate staff for engineering subjects have
been trained abroad, mainly in the USSR, India and Europe. The diversity of
their educational backgrounds makes it difficult to achieve a consistent and
appropriate teaching program related to Nepalese conditions.
2.20      Trade and Semiskill Training.  One clear reason for dependence
on foreign semiskilled workers in Nepal has been the limited skill training
capacity within the country. There are four principal centers for training
skilled workers in Nepal, as follows:
Table 2.8: TRADE TRAINING - ENROLLMENT AND OUTPUT (1976/77)

In addition, the Department of Cottage and Village Industries has four
training centers enrolling about 275 trainees in a one-year course, some in
mechanical and electrical subjects and some in carpentry, but mostly in
crafts. Altogether the annual output of skilled workers in Nepal is probably
less than 300.
2.21      Trade training faces difficult educational, social and administrative
problems in Nepal. Persons who are educationally qualified to undergo skill
training (i.e., those with upper secondary education) still represent an
elite group and are unlikely to take up manual occupations. The Thapathali
Training Institute - which trains upper secondary school graduates in mechanical
and electrical- trades, has experienced a 65% dropout rate despite apparent
high quality of training. The principal cause of dropout is that students do
not like manual work. Dropout previously was almost nil among entrants
without upper secondary education, but academic difficulties were encountered
because of inadequate educational background.



- 18 -
2.22      The administrative arrangements for skill training envisaged
under the NESP have not worked well. The IOE has tended to concentrate on
training at certificate level and to neglect the training of skilled workers.
During the past five years when skill training was administered by the IOE no
new skill training centers were opened and training capacity has not increased.
The present total enrollment in skill training is low, even for Nepal's level
of development.
2.23      Aware of this problem, the Government has decided to transfer
the responsibility for skill training from the IOE to a National Vocational
Training Council,/1 estabished in 1977 (para. 2.14). This seems a realistic
step which in the long run will permit the IOE to concentrate on post-secondary
training. The Council is responsible for rationalizing and developing programs
for trade training. As a result, the Department of Cottage Industries resumed
its control over rural skill training and the Department of Labor over two
vocational training centers. Its work would start with a comprehensive study
of skill requirements and their training implications. There is an urgent
need to prepare a plan for nonfcrmal skill training and to build up an admin-
istrative structure capable of managing such training.
2.24      Nonformal skill training has been offered to rural families
by the Department of Cottage and Village Industries since 1966. There are
ten centers now, four for women and six for men, with a total training
capacity of about 1,200. Courses offered are knitting and sewing, cotton
weaving, carpentry, mechanical fitting, and electrical fitting. The courses
last from three days to six months. The training is free and some financial
assistance is available to graduates to enable them to practice their acquired
skills. Nonfarm rural skill training programs have not yet been developed.
The development of cottage industries in Nepal seems a viable means of
increasing nonfarm incomes of rural families, but no feasibility study or
definite plan is yet available to expand this type of training.
Investment Priorities in Education
2.25      Priorities.  There are three broad areas of investment priorities
in the education sector:
(a)   expansion of basic education, especially for girls, which depends on
finding ways of overcoming obstacles to increased enrollment (i.e.,
high dropout rates) and to reinforce literacy skills learned in
school;
(b)   improvement in the quality of instruction, particularly at upper
secondary level and junior technician level. In the short run,
remedial teaching programs are necessary. In the long run, better
teacher training and textbooks will effect cumulative improvements; and

(c)  expansion of technical training to provide manpower skills needed for
development. This includes particularly senior technicians in civil
engineering, trade training and simple manual skills for village
development projects.
2.26      Plans.  The above priorities for the education sector are evident in
the Fifth Plan.  Of the nine educational policies in the Fifth Plan, the
first four are: (a) emphasis on vocational education to overcome the shortage
of technical manpower; (b) provision of facilities for technical education;
(c) expanded and free primary education; and (d) reorientation of higher
education to ensure the relevance of training to employment needs. The target
set in the Fifth Plan is based on the manpower required for various economic
development programs and the feasible capacity of the various institutes at
Tribhuvan University. The existing campuses will be strengthened and upgraded,
and new campuses will be opened based on the need for certificate and trade
level technical manpower.
2.27      Table 2.9 compares the enrollment targets of the Fifth Plan with
achievements during the Fourth Plan:

2.28      The education sector accounts for about 10.5% of the total investment
allocation of the Fifth Plan compared with 5% in the previous plan. The
largest single item of this allocation to education (18% and NRs 84 million)
is devoted to expansion of primary enrollments by 300,000 students and 8,700
teachers to achieve an enrollment ratio of 64%. The plan also allocates NRs
36 million and NRs 28 million to accommodate an additional 195,000 and 80,000
students at lower and upper secondary levels, respectively; NRs 45 million is
earmarked for curricula and materials development. By far the largest alloca-
tion, NRs 264 million (58%) (Table 2.10), is for higher education. This
investment would not be used to expand enrollments, which are only expected to
increase by 1,000 students or less than 1%. Instead, the investment in higher
education woul-d be focused on development of technical fields needed for
trained manpower. These include:

2.29      The priority in funding assigned to higher technical institutes,
including the IOE, stems from the concern of Nepalese authorities to develop
local training capacity in critical manpower categories. A reliable local
training capacity is regarded as essential to ensure the availability of
manpower required for implementation of government investment programs.
Specifically, the Government plans to expand the enrollment at the certificate
level at IOE to 1,200 students, improve the quality of training through
better facilities and staff and to establish a diploma level program in civil
engineering for 430 students. This addition is consistent with projected
manpower requirements (para. 1.09).
2.30      The Government also plans to establish new campuses for trade
and certificate level training outside the Central Region, one each in the
Eastern Region near Biratnagar, in the Western Region at Pokhara and in the
Far Western Region at Surket. The manpower justification for these regional
campuses, except for the Eastern Region, is unclear and excessively rapid
expansion could dilute the quality of instruction in all related institutions.
The Government should defer expansion of certificate programs except for the
Eastern Region until measures to improve the low quality of instruction
(paras. 2.16 and 2.17) have proved successful.
2.31      External Assistance.  Nepal has received external assistance
(amounting to US$1 million in 1977) for education from many sources, but
will require additional outside help to achieve its education targets during
the Fifth Plan. Fellowships are provided by UNDP, USSR, UK, USAID, India and
Germany. UNICEF and Unesco are providing assistance to the Government in the
following key areas of basic education: women's teacher training, textbook
production, school building materials and training of supervisors. USAID has
been active in curricula and materials development and is financing radio
education primarily for in-service teacher training. In areas of skill
training, USAID is financing the relocation and expansion of the Institute of



- 21 -
Agriculture and Animal Science. CIDA is providing assistance to strengthen
medical training. The ILO has provided technical assistance with UNDP finan-
cing to establish the certificate level course at the IOE. The ADB has
approved a project to assist in the establishment of a regional training
center (mainly trade level) in the Eastern Region (para. 2.30). On the whole,
however, available assistance is inadequate, particularly in the area of
technical education.
2.32      Further external investment in the education sector should be
focused on the elimination of critical skill shortages (both in number and
quality) of junior and senior technicians. In the medium term, assistance is
also needed to help planning of lower level skill training, including rural
trade training, and in the formulation of realistic programs to extend the
coverage of basic education to disadvantaged groups.
3. THE PROJECT /I
Objectives and Scope
3.01      The proposed project aims at building up the capacity of the IOE
to train two levels of technical manpower vital to Nepal's economic growth:
(a)   at the certificate level (Grades 11-12) the project would improve
the quality of the existing teaching programs (para. 2.15) through
the provision of facilities, equipment, staff training and special-
ists' services; and
(b)   at the diploma level (Grades 13-15) /2 the project would help
establish a teaching program in civil engineering for
430 students through the provision of facilities, equip-
ment, staff training and specialists' services.
The Institute of Engineering
3.02      Equipment and Facilities.  The dual project objectives of estab-
lishing new training capacity at the diploma level and increasing the practical
/1  The proposed project was prepared by the Government with the assistance
of the Unesco/IDA Cooperative Program during July/August 1976.
/2  The proposed diploma courses require an extra year beyond the usual two
(para. 2.03) due to the technical content of the courses (Table 3.3).
Moreover, additional periods in mathematics and science are needed because
of the quality of entrants (para. 2.13) and the remedial training at
Grade 10 level (para. 2.10) cannot substitute for remedial training needed
at Grade 12 level for the diploma courses.



- 22 -
content of existing teaching programs will require more and better physical
facilities at the Pulchowk Campus of the IOE. Under the project, financing
would be provided for developing the campus in the following respects:
(a)  buildings:  15 additional classrooms/lecture theaters,
18 laboratories, 1 workshop, 1 library, and a canteen/dining
hall would be constructed and furnished;
(b)  equipment:  teaching equipment for laboratories and workshops;
(c)  teaching materials:  books and journals;
(d)  boarding facilities:  for 560 students from all regions outside
the Kathmandu Valley (about 40% of total student places); and
(e)  staff houses:  for 30 staff, to accommodate administrators,
department heads and half of the diploma level teaching staff.
Facilities provided under the proposed project would be used for teaching at
both the certificate and the diploma levels to facilitate economical operation.
The boarding facilities and staff houses are required because adequate accom-
modation is not available in the Kathmandu area. Provision of staff housing
would serve as an incentive to attract and retain qualified senior staff,
whose services are in great demand in other government agencies and the
private sector.
3.03      Enrollments.  Under the project, student enrollment at the
Pulchowk Campus of the IOE would develop as follows:

pates a higher quality of applicants, since by then more students may
be able to join Grade 11 directly without taking the preliminary course.
/b   Allowing a dropout of about 30 students from the 430 capacity.
3.04      The project aims at quality improvement at the certificate level,
which could not easily be achieved under conditions of rapid enrollment
increase. Consequently, overall enrollments in Grades 11 and 12 of the
certificate program would be held at the 1977 level throughout implementation.
(Enrollments in 1977 doubled the previous year's figure, para. 2.15.) Some
increase in overall enrollments, however, would occur through the introduction
of a six-month remedial program beginning in the 1977 winter semester for
students with weak educational background in science, mathematics and language
(para. 2.16). This is particularly directed at those students coming from
regions outside Kathmandu whose academic backgrounds tend to be weaker. This
remedial program is expected to contribute to a decrease in the dropout rate
between Grades 11 and 12 from 14% in 1978 to 4% in 1983. In view of the past
tendency to increase enrollments rapidly without adequate attention to quality
of instruction, the Government agreed at negotiations that:
(a) unless otherwise jointly reviewed in advance with the Association,
enrollment in the certificate program at the Pulchowk campus of
Grades 11 and 12 of the IOE would be maintained at a total of 1,000
students during project implementation/I; and
/1 During negotiations an understanding was reached that in view of the intense
pressure Qn the IOE to increase enrollments in response to the acute manpower
shortage, a temporary increase in enrollments to 1,200 would be acceptable
to the Association until such a time as the 200 additional students could
be accommodated at another campus of the Institute.



- 24 -
(b)  the establishment of any additional regional campus for certificate
level engineering training would be reviewed in advance with the
Association in terms of evidence of employment demand, feasibility
and implications on the proposed IDA project.
3.05      Establishment of the engineering program for senior technicians at
diploma level would be achieved gradually. In 1978, 25 students would be
admitted to one class for a full year of instruction with special emphasis in
science, mathematics and language. Table 3.1 details annual enrollment
figures and shows the eventual target of six groups, totaling 150 students,
being admitted in 1981. Allowing for a dropout rate of about 10% per year,
full enrollment of 400 students would be achieved by 1983.
3.06      Admissions Policy.  The central aim of the project is to establish
a reliable supply of technical manpower with the practical skills needed to
execute Nepalese development projects. Most of these projects are located
outside the Kathmandu Valley. Geographical representation within the student
body should therefore be an important selection criterion in-view of the
significant need for technical manpower mainly outside the Kathmandu Valley.
This has important implications for the admissions policy of the IOE at both
certificate and diploma levels. While an adequate number of school leavers
exists at both the SLC level (Grade 10) and certificate level (Grade 12) from
which to recruit students for both levels of the IOE, disproportionate repre-
sentation from the Kathmandu region is likely to occur because of previous
inequities in educational development (para. 2.07). To guard against this,
applicants from remote areas have been given extra points in the entrance
examination for certificate courses. At the diploma level applicants would be
required to have had at least one year of related work experience. During
negotiations, the Government provided assurances that persons admitted
to the diploma program after January 1981 would have had at least one year of
prior related work experience.
3.07      Teaching Programs.  A fundamental objective of the project would
be to train students in the skills needed to execute development projects
in Nepal. In teaching programs at both the certificate and diploma levels,
considerable emphasis would be placed on solving engineering problems
frequently encountered in Nepal. At the certificate level, improvements in
the quality of instruction would be sought by increasing the proportion of
instructional time devoted to practical subjects in laboratories, workshops,
and drawing as shown in the following table:

/a See para. 2.17.
The total number of periods in the courses has increased from 168 to 210
because of the introduction of a fifth semester. The total instruction time
has increased, but the percentage of classroom periods has decreased; this
conforms to the new approach with far more emphasis on both laboratory and
workshop practice. This shift in emphasis would require major changes in
syllabi as well. Under the technical assistance to be funded by the UK
Ministry of Overseas Development (ODM), specialists (para. 3.14) would be
provided and teachers would be trained abroad (para. 3.12) to design and
introduce the revised curricula. Revisions to teaching programs would be
preceded by an analysis of present and projected skill requirements of govern-
ment agencies for engineering overseers and supervisors. New teaching courses
would make use of problems and case material drawn from experience with
Nepalese development projects.
3.08      At the diploma level, curricula development would follow a similar
pragmatic orientation with about 45% of instruction time devoted to laboratory
and practical work.

3.09      Staff Recruitment.  Under the project, the IOE would need to
expand its present complement of 85 staff members by 104 people /1 (42 with
graduate qualifications, 40 nongraduates and 22 laboratory technicians).
Projected staff requirements, which cover both net additions and replacements,
and both levels of study, would be phased as follows:

Source: IOE.
3.10      About 120 teachers would be required for the certificate level
course, half of whom would be graduates. The student:teacher ratio would be
10:1, appropriate for the level of instruction and the heavy emphasis on
practical content. About 44 additional staff members would have to be
recruited to replace teachers transferred to the diploma course.
3.11      About 44 teachers wouldi be required at the diploma level, 75% of
them with graduate qualifications. The recruitment target would achieve a
student:teacher ratio of 9:1 which is appropriate given the high proportion
of course work allocated to laboratory and practical work (para. 3.08). The
/1 Including repiacements, the requirement is 118 people.



- 27 -
proposed recruitment of 22 laboratory technicians to assist at both levels
would also strengthen practical teaching capability. Recruitment of teaching
staff for the certificate level should not encounter undue difficulty in view
of the success of the IOE in employing additional staff recently (para. 2.19)
and the projected number of graduates returning from abroad (para. 1.07).
Recruitment of teaching staff for the diploma level is expected to be more
difficult, but would be eased by the incentives offered in the form of
fellowships and staff housing. During negotiations, the Government agreed
that the IOE would maintain student:teacher ratios of 10:1 and 9:1 for the
certificate and diploma level courses, respectively.
3.12      Staff Training.  In addition to recruitment of additional staff,
the proposed project includes an arrangement with the ODM to finance a
program for about 53 man-years of fellowships to improve the training and
experience of staff (see Annex 1). The training program for administrators
would include a study tour of similar institutions in both developing and
advanced countries. Training for teaching staff would focus on curriculum
development, teaching methods and, where appropriate and feasible, the
acquisition of industrial experience.
3.13      A fellowship committee has been organized to ensure that selection
of staff for training would be made in accordance with the objectives of the
staff development program and other specific procedures and selection criteria
which have been established. The recipients of the overseas fellowships
would be bonded to IOE for a specified period of time depending on the length
of their overseas training. This arrangement would help ensure that a basic
core of trained staff remains at IOE in the future. The proposed fellowship
program would be phased so that adequate teaching staff would be available at
IOE for ongoing programs during the absence of staff on fellowships.
3.14      Specialists' Services.  The proposed project would also include
16-1/2 man-years of expatriate specialist services which would be provided
under the ODM technical assistance program (see Annex 1). These services and
staff training would be provided through linkage with Paisley College of Tech-
nology, near Glasgow, Scotland./l The specialists, together with their Nepalese
counterparts, would evaluate and develop teaching programs with regard to
skill requirements of Nepalese development projects, would help prepare
detailed teaching manuals, would help train staff to teach the course content
effectively and would assist in the procurement, installation and operation of
equipment. Emphasis would be placed on training Nepalese to assume those
duties as quickly as possible. The specialists' services would be phased over
the entire implementation period from 1978-82. During negotiations, the
Government provided assurances that: (a) terms of reference and qualifications
of specialists would be acceptable to the Association; and (b) it would seek
such additional specialist services after completion of the project as may be
required to achieve fully and to maintain the objectives of the project.
/1  The College is one of the most advanced colleges in Scotland with about
2,000 students, over 200 academic staff and about 350 technicians, adminis-
trative and other staff. The College is organized in three schools,
Engineering, Science, and Planning and Management Sciences, and in ten
departments, including civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering,
offering degrees, diplomas, and certificates in their respective fields.

3.15      Outputs.  The number of certificates awarded yearly by the IOE is
projected to increase from 120 at present to about 420 in 1979, 300 of which
would be in civil engineering. Output from the diploma level courses would
increase more slowly, starting with about 20 in 1981 and increasing to 100
in 1984. Based on present shortages and projected requirements for technical
manpower (paras. 1.06 and 1.09), these graduates are not expected to have
difficulty in finding employment. They would fill new positions or would
replace foreign technicians recruited to fill vacancies occurring in the
interim. Graduates would, according to their qualifications and interests,
become engineers or overseers for civil works projects (roads, water supply,
building construction, etc.) developed and executed by Government; or architec-
tural draftsmen; employees in private firms, such as construction companies;
self-employed entrepreneurs; or teachers of skill courses at various levels
in the education system.
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.16      The Government would establish monitoring and evaluation systems
covering both the certificate and diploma courses at IOE to collect and
analyze, at the beginning of each school year, information on:
(a) the number of applicants, number accepted, and enrollment by
course, region, and district;
(b) the number of graduates who have completed each course in the prior
year within the prescribed duration of the course, compared with the
original intake;
(c) the number of graduates of prior years employed within six months,
one year, and two years after graduation, classified by major
employers and fields;
(d) staffing numbers, qualifications - including practical experience -
and turnover; and
(e) assessment of fellowship programs according to the usefulness of
training received and the subsequent assignments of the fellows
after they have completed their overseas training.
3.17      During negotiations, the Government agreed to establish by
December 31, 1979 a monitoring and evaluation system and provide the Asso-
ciation annually, during the project implementation period and for five years
thereafter, with analytical summaries of the above information (para 3.16)
with recommendations to improve project implementation. In addition, the
Government gave assurances that not later than the Closing Date of the Credit
Agreement, it would prepare and send to the Association a draft project
completion report providing its assessment of the project and the lessons
learned during implementation.

Related Studies
3.18      In conjunction with the proposed project, the Government would con-
duct three feasibility studies on key issues in education in Nepal to provide
the basis for future development of the sector. The three studies would examine:
(a) primary education with emphasis on improving female participation and reten-
tion rates (para. 2.06); (b) trade level skills, developing a plan for rationali-
zing trade training on a national basis and designing the content and delivery
system of a rural skill training program (para. 2.24); and (c) the need for
establishing a trade and certificate level engineering institute in the Western
Development Region (para. 2.30). Outside sources of funding for these studies
are being sought. During negotiations, the Government agreed to provide or
cause to be provided the funds necessary to complete the studies by June 30,
1979, under terms of reference acceptable to the Association.

4.03      Base cost estimates refer to November 1977 prices.  Construction
costs have been estimated on the basis of functional and economical facilities.
A campus master plan and part of the sketch plans have been prepared, reviewed
and revised. Construction unit costs are derived from recent costs of
similar buildings under construction at the Pulchowk Campus and in Kathmandu.
Even though local materials are used to the extent possible, the average unit
cost estimate (about US$128/sq m), is higher than in India and Bangladesh but
is comparable to construction costs in other Asian countries. This is largely
due to the high cost of imported materials (about 50% to 60% of building
materials, e.g. steel, glass, hardware, roofing and material for installation
of utilities). Comparisons of capital costs per place are not applicable
since the proposed project provides extensions to existing facilities.



- 31 -
4.04      Utilization factors for classrooms, workshops and laboratories of
the proposed project are economical and range from 70% to 90% based on 42 hours
teaching per week. For economical operation, the facilities and equipment
provided would, in general, be used by both the certificate and diploma level
courses. The cost of equipment is reasonable and has been determined from
equipment lists related to the teaching program. Master equipment lists have
been prepared and reviewed. About 6% of the total project cost would be
allocated for staff housing and about 10% for hostel facilities. These facili-
ties are needed to ensure recruitment of qualified staff and to accommodate
students from rural areas.
4.05      Physical contingencies (Annex 3) add 10% to the cost of site
development, construction, furniture, equipment and professional services.
A total price contingency of US$1.33 million is included for expected price
escalation at the following annual percentage rates:
Table 4.3: PRICE ESCALATION ESTIMATES

4.06      Based on detailed analysis, the foreign exchange component has been
estimated as follows: (a) site work, 30%; (b) construction, 40%; (c) furniture,
70%; (d) equipment, 95%; (e) professional services, 20%; and (f) technical and
engineering services for a possible future project, 90%. These percentages
have been derived by (i) determining the costs of civil works attributable to
material, labor, overhead and profit; and (ii) analyzing the c.i.f. Kathmandu
costs of imported equipment and furniture, inland transportation and insurances,
and delivery and installation of equipment and furniture. The foreign
exchange component is estimated at US$4.4 million, or about 65% of IDA-
financed project costs, and at about US$5.5 million, or about 70% of the total
project cost, including technical assistance.
4.07      Customs Duty and Taxes.  All items specifically imported for the
proposed project would be subject to a 1% handling charge. Civil works con-
tractors and equipment suppliers are required by the laws of the Kingdom of
Nepal to pay a 2-1/2% contract tax.
Project Financing
4.08      The proposed IDA credit of US$5.7 million equivalent would finance
73% of the total project costs, ODM would finance 14%, and the remaining 13%
would be met by the Government. The financing plan is shown in Table 4.4 below.

/a Including contingency allowances (physical and price increase).
4.09      Upgrading of the existing certificate program is not expected to
increase annual recurrent costs from their present level of less than NRs 4,000
per student. The incremental annual recurrent expenditure generated by the
diploma course when it is in full operation in 1983 would be about NRs 1.8 mil-
lion (representing less than 1% of 1977 education recurrent budget) in 1977
prices and NRs 4,200 per student as follows:

/d 1976/77 level.



- 33 -
The US$340 is about half of the cost of comparable training in India (US$730),
the difference being largely due to the cost of travel and the higher costs
of boarding and lodging. Cost analysis, which takes into account a US$4,200
capital cost per diploma student and discounts it at the rate of 8%, shows
that the local training cost would be about US$710 per annum as compared with
US$730 in India. However, the more appropriate comparison is with the
weighted average annual training cost taking into account all foreign destina-
tions, which is estimated at US$1,400./1 This means that local training
would remain more economical when discounted at a rate of up to 25%.
Project Implementation
4.10      Administration.  A project implementation unit has already been
established in the IOE, Pulchowk Campus. The project director, a full-time
project coordinator and a full-time project architect, a procurement officer
and an education officer would be responsible for the implementation of the
proposed project. All these key staff have been appointed and are acceptable
to the Association. The project unit would be further strengthened in 1978 by
a project engineer and an accountant, all working on a full-time basis. They
would supervise the preparation of the campus master plan, architectural
sketch plans, master lists for equipment and furniture, bidding documents for
civil works, equipment and furniture, execution of construction and procurement,
and delivery and installation of equipment. The unit would also be assisted
by an equipment specialist and a curriculum specialist, whose services would be
provided under the ODM technical cooperation program (para. 3.14). In addition,
the unit would be provided with adequate supporting staff and facilities, and
funds have been included in the proposed credit for procurement of office
equipment and furniture. During negotiations the Government provided assurance
that qualified staff would be retained on a full-time basis in the positions
of project coordinator, project architect, procurement officer, and education
officer during the project implementation period.
4.11      Professional Services.  Design, bidding and supervision of civil
works would be the responsibility of consultant architects selected and
commissioned by the IOE on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association.
Nepal has about five qualified architectural consulting firms plus the
consultant group of Tribhuvan University to prepare the campus plan and to
design and supervise this project. However, the capacity of the consulting
firms is limited. Therefore to assure smooth and timely implementation of
the project, preparation of the bidding documents and construction of the
facilities would be executed in three phases (see Chart 5). Provision has
been made in the project for US$140,000 to cover the costs of engineering and
technical services required to prepare future education projects.
4.12      Site.  A suitable site is available for expansion of the IOE.
/1 This figure is calculated on the following basis: in the past four years
about 75% of diploma students were trained in India and the remaining 25%
in the USSR, UK, USA, etc. The average annual training cost in the UK is
estimated at US$3,400.



- 34 -
4.13      Procurement.  Because of the relatively small size of contracts
(mostly below US$600,000), contracts for civil works would be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally following procedures that are
satisfactory to the Association. Prior approval of the Association would be
required for award of any civil works contract exceeding US$200,000 equivalent.
Foreign and locally established foreign firms would be allowed to submit bids.
4.14      Equipment and furniture contracts over US$50,000 equivalent would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank Group guidelines. In bid evaluation, domestic manufacturers would be
allowed a preferential margin oi 15% or the existing customs. duty, whichever
is lower, over the c.i.f. price of competing imports. Direct imports for IDA-
assisted projects are subject to a 1% handling charge. Equipment and furniture
items would be packaged to allow bulk procurement. Equipment and furniture
purchases that cannot reasonably be grouped to form contracts for at least
US$50,000 equivalent and aggregating less than US$350,000 equivalent could be
awarded without prior approval of the Association on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally following government procedures satisfactory to
the Association. Books (total estimated cost US$200,000) would be purchased
directly from publishers or authorized distributors at the lowest possible
prices. In addition, off-the-shelf items, not exceeding US$10,000 equivalent
for each contract and aggregating a maximum of US$50,000 equivalent, could be
purchased on the basis of a minimum of three price quotations.
4.15      Maintenance and Spare Parts.  To ensure proper use of the facilities
and equipment, funds have been included in the project for:
(a) construction of, and equipment for, one maintenance and repair
workshop, and
(b) spare parts for instructional equipment.
During negotiations the Government provided assurances that the maintenance
and repair workshop would be staffed with properly trained personnel.
4.16      Implementation Period.  The proposed project would be implemented
over about five years, but construction and procurement of the equipment and
furniture should be completed in about four years (Charts 4 and 5).
Disbursements
4.17      The proposed credit of US$5.7 million would finance 85% of the total
costs excluding technical assistance and would be disbursed as follows:
(a) 100% of the c.i.f. cost of directly imported equipment and
furniture;
(b) 100% of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured equipment
and furniture;
(c) 65% of the cost of imported equipment and furniture procured locally;



- 35 -
(d) 75% of the expenditures on civil works; and
(e) 100% of the cost of technical and engineering services, and profes-
sional fees.
To the extent practicable, withdrawal applications would be aggregated in amounts
of US$50,000 or more prior to submission to the Association for reimbursement
out of the proceeds of the proposed credit. Undisbursed funds could be used
with the approval of the Association for other project-related components.
The estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Table 4.6 below. Disbursement
is expected to be completed by December 31, 1983.

5. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
5.01      The proposed project forms part of the continuing NESP strategy to
redirect education resources to produce the technical manpower needed for
development. The project would reinforce the objective of diverting higher
education expenditures away from the humanities and social sciences and
towards technical training.
5.02      The proposed project would help establish a steady and reliable
source of locally trained senior technicians in civil engineering, thus
minimizing the present dependence on unreliable foreign training. At the
certificate level, the provision of equipment and technical assistance
would allow a substantial increase in the proportion of instruction devoted
to practical teaching. At the diploma level, curricula would aim at training
engineers to solve Nepalese problems, in contrast with present foreign
training which is not closely related to Nepalese conditions.
5.03      The project is also well justified in terms of economy and efficiency.
Improvements in the quality of teaching envisaged at the certificate level
would help increase the presently low (40%) pass rates and reduce costs per
graduate. The establishment of a diploma program in Nepal would cost 55%
less per student per year in recurrent expenditure than the least expensive
foreign training (NRs 4,200 compared to NRs 9,100 equivalent in India). The
annual local training cost which includes amortized capital cost (US$4,200
per place over a 30-year period) would be less than the weighted annual
foreign training cost (US$1,400) when discounted at a rate of up to 25%
(para. 4.09).
5.04      The principal benefit cf the proposed project, however, would
be in helping eliminate one of the critical constraints to implementation
of development plans, viz. shortages of technicians in civil engineering.
Under the proposed project, the certificate level graduates of the IOE would
meet about 50% of the estimated requirement for junior technicians in the
Fifth Plan, and about 85% in both the Fifth and Sixth Plans. At the diploma
level the output would meet 30% of the expected manpower demand for civil
engineers in the Sixth Plan.
Risks
5.05      Apart from the usual implementation difficulties in Nepal, achieve-
ment of project objectives would depend mainly on two factors. The first
is the Borrower's commitment to achieving reasonable quality standards given
,.he magnitude of manpower shortages and the social pressure to enroll more
applicants. A rapid expansion of enrollments could strain teaching resources
and contribute to a deterioration, or lack of improvement, in the standard of
learning. The quality objectives of the project, therefore, require the
Government to resist pressures to expand enrollments. This potential problem
has been reviewed with the Government, and the agreements reached (para. 3.04)
reflect the intentions of the Government to maintain enrollments within
reasonable limits.



- 37 -
5.06      Another risk inherent in this type of project is the tendency to
maintain or revert to a theoretical bias in instruction rather than focussing
on solving engineering problems relevant to Nepalese conditions. Specific
measures, such as required work experience (para. 3.06), have been introduced
into the project to counteract this tendency, but this factor would need to be
kept under careful review during implementation.
5.07      On the whole, the risks have been minimized through project design
and are offset by the potentially large benefit of reducing manpower con-
straints to implementation of development projects.
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on
the following principal points:
(a) enrollment of certificate students (Grades 11-12) on the Pulchowk
Campus would be limited to 1,000 students, and any plan to establish
a new regional campus for certificate level training would be
reviewed in advance jointly with the Association (para. 3.04);
(b) persons admitted to the diploma program after January 1981 would have
had at least one year of prior related work experience (para. 3.06);
(c) the IOE would (i) maintain student:teacher ratios of 10:1 and 9:1
for the certificate and diploma courses, respectively (para. 3.11);
and (ii) operate the equipment maintenance and repair workshops
staffed with properly trained technicians (para. 4.15);
(d) the Government would seek additional technical assistance after
completion of the project as may be required (para. 3.14);
(e) terms of reference and qualifications of specialists (paras. 3.14
and 3.18) would be acceptable to the Association;
(f) the Government would establish a project monitoring and evaluation
system and prepare a draft project completion report providing the
Government's assessment of the project (para. 3.17);
(g) feasibility studies on (i) primary education; (ii) trade and
rural skill training; and (iii) development of a regional engineering
institute in the Western Development Region would be carried out by
June 30, 1979 under terms of reference acceptable to the Association
(para. 3.18); and
(h) employment of qualified key project staff on a full-time basis
during project implementation (para. 4.10).



- 38 -
6.02      A condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit would be that
all the conditions applicable to the Government for effectiveness of the ODM
technical assistance grant have been met (para. 4.18).
6.03      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project constitutes a
suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$5.7 million equivalent to His Majesty's
Government of Nepal.



ANNEX 1

NEPAL: TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROJECT
Technical Assistance Programs
(As agreed to be provided by the Ministry of Overseas Development, UK)
Overview
1.        The proposed project aims to improve the quality of the five existing
courses at certificate level with an enrollment of about 1,200, including about
200 students in remedial courses, and establish a new diploma course in civil
engineering for about 400 students at the Institute of Engineering (IOE),
Tribhuvan University. The curriculum at both levels should include adequate
practical content and be relevant to Nepal, and the syllabi for the certificate
courses need major revision to suit the well-equipped laboratories and workshops
provided under the proposed project. Technical assistance would be required
in the following areas: (a) course and laboratory development and curricula
design; (b) preparation of instructional materials; (c) drawing up equipment
lists with proper specifications before procurement; (d) giving advice on
laboratory and workshop layout and service requirements; and (e) supervision
of staff training and development, which should include, apart from teaching
staff, administrators, laboratory technicians and other supporting staff.
The Technical Cooperation Program
2.        The program consists of 16-1/2 man-years of specialists' services
(f342,000) and 53-1/2 man-years of fellowships (f258,000) at a total esti-
mated cost of 6600,000 (US$1.1 million approximately), to be borne by the
UK Government. One specific feature of the program is the proposed linkage
with one well-established sister college in UK (the Paisley College of Tech-
nology, Scotland) for continuity, consistency and an integrated approach.
3.        The specialists' services consist of the following:
Phase A - April 1978 to September 1978 (approx.). Specialists' advice and
assistance on:
(a) curricula design;
(b) equipment identification and specifications; and
(c) laboratory layout and service requirements through a series of short
assignments in Nepal together with some detailed work in the UK to:
(i) prepare final equipment lists to be ready from mid-1978 onwards;
(ii) prepare equipment specifications in a form suitable for inter-
national competitive bidding from about September 1978 onwards;
and
(iii) provide adequate input on laboratory layouts and service
requirements as needed by the Project Architect.
The areas to be covered and the scheduled timing are as follows:
