A. Program Purpose, Development Objectives and Phasing
1.     Program purpose and development objectives
The project will support the implementation of the second half of the Government's Education
Sector Policy Framework, 1988-2005 , and its accompanying investment program. The program targets
the following main objectives over the 8 year period 1998/99-2005/06: See Annex I for the logical
framework and Annex 4, page 24-26, for annual monitoring indicators.
1 .Access to Basic Education: Achieve a gross enrollment ratio of 90% through: (a) extension of
double-shift and multi-grade teaching, (b) new construction and rehabilitation of existing facilities, (c)
incorporation of English into madrassa education, (d) improvement in the supply and deployment of
teachers, (e) incentives/subsidies for the poor, and (f) examine the extent and needs of special needs
students.
2. Girls' Education: Increase girls' enrollment and retention in grades 1- 12 through : (a) a scholarship
scheme and flexible fee payment schedules, (b) development of a supportive learning environment, (c)
a community and teacher mobilization program, and (d) an increase in the proportion of female
teachers.
3. Basic Education Quality: Ensure that all students acquire the desired levels of achievement in core
areas through (a) curriculum revision for grades 1-9, (b) ensuring that each child has access to a
complete set of books, (c) improvements in the professional development of teachers, and (d)
developing a national assessment system and improving the quality and relevance of examinations.
4. Early Childhood Development and Care: Develop a program for ECDC while expanding on-going
care provider training and development of guidelines for center establishment.
5. Secondary Education: Increase the gross enrollment ratio from 16% to about 25%, improve the
quality and lower costs through: (a) extension of double-shift teaching, (b) construction of new
facilities, and (c) introduction of computer technology and literacy programs to ensure that all
students graduate with basic computer literacy skills.
6. Vocational and Technical Education: Improve the relevance of training to the demands of the job
market and to opportunities for income generation in rural areas and increase private sector
participation in the provision and financing of training through: (a) employer, market surveys and
tracer studies, (b) development of a training policy and strategy, (c) testing of a training fund, and (d)
appropriate course and infrastructure development once needs, financing and provision arrangements
are established.
7. University Education: Develop a cost-effective plan to upgrade select existing post-secondary
programs to degree level, and gradually develop degree level programs focusing first on training
secondary school science and math teachers, Information Technology, and Business Studies.
8. Adult Education/Functional Literacy Program: Pilot, and expand if successful, a new strategy of
development and delivery of adult literacy programs by the private sector.
9. Capacity Building for Sector Management: Enhance the performnance of the education sector by:

Country: Gambia                                                                          Page 4
including its ability to manage this program, enhancing its ability to mobilize funds, allocate resources
and control expenditure, raising the skill level of its staff, and adjusting some of its key work practices.
Strategies selected to achieve these objectives were based on considerations of reducing gender
disparities, maximizing resource utilization and cost-effectiveness, improving the efficiency and equity of
cost recovery policies, and the comparative advantages of the public and private sector in the provision of
educational services.
2.    Program phasing, performance indicators and triggers to move to phase 2
While these are the overall objectives of the program for the 8-year period, the program is
divided into two phases of four years each to allow for capacity to be built in certain areas and pilots
tested prior to larger scale implementation. The objectives and activities for the two phases are included
in the Program Description in Annex 2. Annex 1 contains the logical framework for phase 1. Annex 4
(pp. 24-26) shows the annual performance indicators. The Government has prepared a logical framework
for the entire program which is not included here. Triggers to move from phase one to phase two are as
follows:
Trigger                                  Indicator
Donor coordination is effective          *  Annual review and planning meetings with all
main partners are organized and held by DoSE
*  Common monitoring indicators are adopted
and in use
Access to basic education is increased   *  75% of IDA financed classroom construction
program is completed
Textbook recycling and rental systems are   *  All grade 1-6 students have use of a set of
functioning                                 textbooks free of charge
*  Rental recovery rates for grades 7-9 average
not less than 85%
Capacity of the Gambia College increases   *  Gambia College is able to take in 300 PTC and
to meet the need for trained teachers        150 HTC teachers a year
Sufficient recurrent budget is allocated to    *  Budgetary allocations agreed to annually
education                                   materialize
B. Strategic Context
1.     Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1)
A CAS is being presented to the Board with this project. The broad objective of the proposed
CAS is to achieve rapid, broad-based and sustained increases in GDP per capita that will reduce poverty.
This would be achieved through a two-pronged approach that (a) supports macroeconomic priorities
aimed at more rapid, broad-based, export-oriented sustained growth in excess of population growth,
focusing in particular on private sector development, and (b) in collaboration with key development
partners and NGOs, improve social indicators and reduce poverty through (i) a better understanding of
poverty, (ii) direct investments in health and education, (iii) improving farmer's incomes and basic
services in rural areas, and (iv) developing a training policy to address the economy's needs. In
education, the main objectives of the CAS focus on: (a) expanding basic education parallel with specific
efforts to promote female enrollment; (b) improving the cost-effectiveness of service delivery, and equity

Country: Gambia                                                                        Page 5
and cost-effectiveness of public expenditure, and (c) developing a vocational cost-effectiveness of public
expenditure. These are main objectives of the Education Sector Program.
2.     Main sector issues and Government strategy
CONTEXT. The education development priorities outlined in the Sector Policy Framework
(1988-2003) prepared in 1988 were, by 2003, to: (1) Increase the gross enrollment rate in grades 1-6 to
75% and the transition rate from grade 6-7 to 60%; (2) Lower the school entry age from 8 to 7; (3)
Develop a broad-based curriculum for basic education (grades 1-9); (4) Improve the quality of learning in
the basic cycle by upgrading all unqualified teachers, and increasing expenditure on learning materials;
(5) Increase access to post-secondary vocational training and improve the co-ordination of its provision;
(6) Increase opportunities for training out-of-school youth, school leavers and adults.
Since the start of the policy period some important achievements have been attained. By
1996/97, the gross enrollment ratio in grades 1-6 had already reached 70% (80% including the
madrassas), girls' share of the total increased from 40% to 44%; the school entry age was lowered from 8
to 7; and the transition rate from grade 6 to 7 increased from 35% to 70%. The 1,200 unqualified
teachers in the system at the start of the period were upgraded; and textbooks were made available to
allow for a set of books for two pupils in grades 1-5 and a set for each pupil from grades 6-9 on a rental
basis. To finance the expansion, education's share of the recurrent budget increased from 15% in 1990 to
19.4% in 1996/97 of total Government expenditure (25.8% excluding debt service).
The second half of the policy period will essentially maintain the same priorities and build on
these accomplishments while pushing the enrollment target for the 9-year basic education cycle to 90% of
the school-aged population by 2005. It will also pursue issues related to equity, effectiveness, efficiency,
capacity building and sector management which had not received sufficient attention, as well as emerging
issues in higher education and sector financing.
MAIN ISSUES include those internal and external to the education system. External factors that
impinge on achieving sector objectives include: (a) high population growth which makes it difficult for
service provision to keep pace, (b) limited public revenue and high debt service (30% of recurrent
expenditure) which limits the public resources possible for education, and (c) high levels of poverty in
rural areas which affects the demand for education. Since education policies can influence the latter
through increased subsidies for the poor, poverty, as it affects the demand for education, is included as
an issue internal to education although the causes may be found elsewhere. The main issues internal to
the system are the following.
(a)    Feasibility of achieving universal enrollment in basic education. Supply. Enrollment growth
will need to be sustained at about 8% a year in the nine-year basic education cycle to achieve the target
gross enrollment ratio of 90% by 2005. It will require space to accommodate an additional 175,000
children, all school types combined, or double the number currently enrolled. To minimize new
construction, Government will expand double-shifting to cover both cycles of basic education as well as
to offload overcrowded classrooms to maintain 45 students per class. In rural areas, multigrade teaching
will be introduced in all classes where enrollment is under 20. In addition, about 3,000 classrooms will
need to be constructed over the 8-year period. This represents a more than three fold increase in the
construction program the DoSE has managed over the past six years, with important delays due to the
weak capacity of the construction sector in The Gambia. Maintenance will also become increasingly
important. Enrollment growth will depend also on the availability of teachers. The DoSE will have to
increase the utilization of its existing teaching force, through changes in deployment practices, and will
have to increase the output of new, qualified teachers by building up the capacity of the Gambia College.

Demand. (Refer to the economic analysis in Annex 4). Achieving universal enrollment in basic
education will depend significantly on addressing economic constraints, particularly for girls, and
integrating the formal school curriculum into the madrassa system. In general, the demand for education
throughout the Gambia is high, as reflected in the rapid growth in enrollment at all levels and low dropout
rates (2-5%). The availability of schools is also widespread. Of the 57,000 children not currently
attending primary school, an estimated 30% (9% and 11 % of school-aged girls and boys respectively)
attend the madrassas, the majority (96%) for religious reasons. Of the remaining children out of school
(about 40,000) an estimated 75% are girls, 70% are in households that earn less than the median income,
and most live in the rural areas.
Several studies concluded that the direct cost of education is the main barrier to attendance,
particularly for girls. In grades 1-6 minimum necessary family expenditure is estimated at 125 dalasi
(excluding school lunch). Direct costs increase considerably in grades 7-9 and 10-12 where minimum
necessary family expenditure per student is estimated at 1,250 dalasi and 2,600 dalasi respectively. If
families have I child each in grades 1-6, 7-9 and 10-12, the total cost would represent about 20% of a
poor family's income and 8% of family income for those in the highest income quintile. While the direct
cost of primary education is not excessive for the lowest income quintiles, surveys show that the high cost
at the other levels of education deters poor parents from ever enrolling their children. Schooling also
starts at a time of year when incomes are lowest, and the additional expense of lunch doubles the cost.
(b)    Unknown effectiveness of basic education. In The Gambia, the quality of education has
typically been defined in terms of inputs -- number of unqualified teachers upgraded, number of books
ordered, share of government expenditure allocated to education, etc. Less attention has been paid to
determining if resources are used effectively or reach students and teachers in an equitable way, or to
determnining what students are actually learning. It is often said that achievement has been declining
particularly in Maths and English, but there is no reliable mechanism to evaluate this perception. Several
reasons account for this: (a) The curriculum and learning materials are not derived from any clearly
defined hierarchy of learning objectives making it difficult to know what to assess. (b) There is often a
disconnect between curriculum and examination objectives, the latter driving what is actually taught. (c)
There is no proper linkage between curriculum development, teacher training, and learning materials
development.
(c)    Limited access to post-basic education that responds to development needs. Secondary
education enrolls 16% of the school-aged population compared with an average of 25% for Sub-Saharan
Africa and is available almost exclusively in urban areas. Of a total 20 secondary schools (grades 10-12)
enrolling 11,400 students, fourteen ( 85% of students) are located in the Banjul and Western Divisions.
The remaining four regions have 6 schools which can accommodate about 2,700 students although these
regions account for about 55% of the total school-aged population. Therefore, 34% of urban children
have access to secondary education, but places available can only accommodate about 6% of youths
outside Banjul and its surrounding division. Girls' enrollment is also low (only 34% of the total). The
share of enrollment in math and science has been declining over time, and computer technology exists in
only a few grant-aided and private schools.
The Gambia faces the challenge of developing a more reliable and cost-effective strategy for its
students to access higher education. Three post-secondary institutions -- the Gambia College, the Gambia
Technical Training Institute and the Management Development Institute -- offer one to three year

Country: Gambia                                                                        Page 7
programs in teacher training, agriculture, livestock, public health, nursing, midwifery, management,
accounting, construction, engineering, computing and commercial studies. Beyond the certificate level,
students go abroad. Outlets for higher education in neighboring countries such as Nigeria and Sierre
Leone have greatly diminished and recent tuition hikes price many Gambians out of the higher education
market.
(d)    Weak capacity. The sector is characterized by: (a) increasingly stronger leadership at policy and
strategy level, but weak management at all operational levels, (b) weak organization, including an
inadequate division of labor and responsibilities, and a lack of authority and accountability, (c) poor
management of human resources, where the recruitment, selection, training and promotion of staff are not
guided by a well-conceived institutional development strategy, (d) shortage of highly-skilled, experienced
professionals in all specialized areas, and (e) inefficient work practices and procedures, including weak
informnation systems, reporting systems and coordination.
(e)    Questionable equity, efficiency and effectiveness of public financing. During the 1990s,
public expenditure on education increased as a share of total government expenditure (1 5%-21%), as a
share of GDP (2.6%-4.3%), and in real terms (10% annually). The share allocated to primary education
increased from 38% to 45%, reflecting the priority given to this level of education. However, the equity
and cost-effectiveness of expenditure could be improved.
The equity and poverty focus of public expenditure in The Gambia is similar to that found in
other African countries -- the poorest receive the smallest share of education spending because: (a) the
poorest send fewer children to school, particularly beyond grade 6, and (b) government subsidies increase
with the level of education. The result is, for grades 1- 12, the poorest 40% of households account for
55% of the school-aged population but receive only 37% of government expenditure, while the
wealthiest 40% of households have 29% of the school-aged population but receive 42% of government
expenditure. Parents also pay a larger share of the total cost of primary education (22%) than they do for
secondary education (17%).
Cost-effectiveness. (Refer to Annex 4). Expenditure to maintain and improve learning conditions
is too low. Per student recurrent expenditure at all levels of education (515 dalasi grades 1-6, 1,700
dalasi grades 7-12) is similar to the average for Sub-Saharan Africa. Although the Gambia spends a
comparatively lower share of its budget on salaries (80-90% of basic and secondary education
expenditure), student: teacher ratios are among the lowest in the region and much lower than what is
found in the private sector (30:1 in gr. 1-6 and 17:1 in grades 1-9 compared with about 45:1 and 35:1
respectively in the private sector). Since there is little evidence that ratios in this range yield better
outcomes compared with student:teacher ratios of 40 or 45, savings on the salary side could be made and
transferred to other essential inputs. As shown in the financial analysis, rationalizing teaching personnel
is a necessary condition for the recurrent cost affordability of the program. Expenditure on student
supplies (exercise books and pencils) accounts for only 2% of the budget (18 dalasi per student), but
supplies are always inadequate and often do not reach students. There is no allocation to supply books
for basic education. They are supposed to be provided to students on a full cost recovery (rental) basis.
In comparison, expenditure on untargeted subsidies is high -- 6% of the primary recurrent budget.
This includes the school bus service (4% of budget, D 24 per student) which mainly services a small
percent of students in Banjul who are not the poorest (D 150 per user), and school lunches (2% of the
budget, D 10 per student, also not targeted to the poorest). Examinations consume an additional 6% of
the basic education budget and 7% of the budget for secondary education at a cost of D 34 per primary
student and D 325 per secondary student (between D 300-400 per examinee). Parents spend an additional
D 75, D 200 and D 350 dalasi for exams at the end of grade 6, 9 and 12. At the secondary level, grant in

aid follows no logical formula and is higher than per student expenditure in public schools.
In higher education, at least 50% of students are fully subsidized while fees are charged for primary and
secondary education despite the higher social returns to these levels of education. A continuation of these
per student costs is unsustainable if the growth and quality objectives of the program are to be achieved.
Government Strategy. The Government's objectives and strategies for addressing these issues
are contained in: (a) the Revised Education Policy, 1988-2003 (which updates the original Education
Policy, 1988-2003 approved by Government in 1988), (b) the draft Master Plan and Investment Program,
1998-2005 which describes the priority programs, implementation schedules, responsibilities, and
resource requirements, and in (c) the Public Expenditure Review, 1998 which lays out policy decisions
regarding inter and intra-sectoral financing. The analyses underpinning the identification of issues, and
choice of strategies and objectives are contained in household surveys, preparation studies, and other
sector work carried out during implementation of the first half of the investment program. The program
was developed through both analytical work and a consultative process are involving key stakeholders
and development partners. The process began in 1996 with regional focus groups, followed by a national
conference. Drafts of the program documents have been discussed with NGOs, the teacher's union,
representatives of the madrassas, the cabinet, the National Assembly, and key development partners.
A donor's Round Table is scheduled for July 1998.
3.     Strategic choices
A number of strategic choices were made with respect to policy and operational options. An
overriding decision concerned the choice between expanding secondary and higher education in the short
run or moderating their expansion until universal basic education is achieved. The choice was made to
continue to expand and improve the quality at that level while moderately expanding access to secondary
and higher education.
Achieving 90% gross enrollment in basic education. The main issues to address are the
provision and maintenance of sufficient facilities, and reducing barriers to enrollment for girls and the
poor. They will be addressed by (a) a construction and maintenance strategy that draws on all existing
construction capabilities, (b) making better use of existing resources by significantly expanding double-
shift and multigrade teaching and providing support to madrassas, (c) reducing the barriers to the
enrollment of girls and the poor through increased subsidies and lower fees, a subsidized school lunch
program, and an IEC program, and (d) increasing the supply of trained teachers in an affordable way.
In considering strategies to address these issues, several options were considered.
(i)    Whether to make basic education compulsory or to continue with voluntary enrollment.
Since supply is not yet universal, Government decided to maintain voluntary enrollment coupled with
interventions to reduce the barriers for girls and the poor.
(ii)    Whether to make basic education entirely free or to continue existing financing patterns where:
(a) at the lower level, fees are charged for books and exams while Government provides supplies (i.e.
exercise books and pencils) and subsidizes transport and school lunch, and (b) at the upper level (grades
7-9) where fees are charged for enrollment, book rental and exams while Government provides supplies
and subsidizes transportation. Given the importance of books in the learning process, Government has
decided to: (a) at the lower level, loan textbooks free of charge to students and shift Government
purchase of supplies to parents, eliminate the transport subsidy, and phase out the grade 6 exam. (b) At
the upper basic cycle, the same applies. However, enrollment fees will be retained, but reduced, and part
of the fees will be used to cover the exam fee.

(iii)   Whether to ignore the madrassa system or make an effort to integrate it into the formal school
system. Government decided on the latter to address a social problem resulting from the inability of
madrassa graduates to obtain employment due to lack of English and to lower the cost to Government of
basic education.
(iv)   For classroom construction, alternative scenarios were created based on an assessment of the
capacity of all possible partners. The traditional strategy of contracting out to local enterprises was
expanded in favor of utilizing all capacities, including enterprises with GAMWORKS management,
NGOs, and community management.
(v)    To increase the supply of trained teachers, three options were considered -- maintaining the
traditional, and costly, 2 year residential pre-service program, cutting back the program to one year, or
combining 1 year residential training with an additional year of on-the-job training spread out over two
years. The latter option was selected based on cost-effectiveness criteria. It will permit a rapid response
to the need for an increasing number of teachers at lower cost due to salary savings, and is a more
effective method as what is learned is immediately put to use.
Examinations and assessment. A choice was made between continuing with a high cost
examinations system to monitor student achievement or introduce a less costly sample-based system.
It was decided that sample assessment would be introduced and the grade 6 examination phased out by
2003 according to the schedule in the Master Plan
Secondary education. The main strategic choice concerned the public vs. private provision of
secondary education. Government decided to maintain current policy whereby Government will establish
the schools which are governed by a board of directors. Following 5 years of proven management
competence, the schools will be converted to grant-aided schools which will receive a subsidy from
Government to cover teacher salaries, other expenditure being covered by fees and sponsorship
programs.
Higher education. A cautious and incremental approach is being taken to the development of
higher education, focusing on upgrading existing post-secondary programs to degree level. While the
costing and implementation plan for the program needs to be done before any further decisions are taken,
several strategic choices have been made. The main choice made concerns how to offer degree level
programs of acceptable quality given the existing limited capacity and the long time frame required for
building local capacity to provide those programs. Several options are possible: (a) massive training of
staff overseas, (b) recruitment of expatriate staff while Gambian staff are being trained abroad, and (c)
twinning arrangements with partner universities who would provide professors, build the capacity of
Gambian staff, and confer a joint degree. To ensure quality, the latter was selected as the preferred
option.

2.     Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the program
Policy reforms outlined in the Government's Sector Policy supported by the program and not
included in B3 are:
1) Restructuring the Department of State for Education to give greater responsibility and
accountability to managers, and to establish a Technology and Human Resource, and a Secondary
and Higher Education Directorate;
2) Introducing performance evaluation for teachers and managers;
3) Freezing expenditure on the school bus service; and
4) Freezing expenditure on examinations.
Other policies discussed and to be worked out in the near future:
1 ) Partnership between public and private sectors in the provision and financing of VET;
2) Reducing subsidies and introducing cost recovery in post-secondary education; and
3) Reducing subsidies to the school bus service and examinations.
3.    Benefits and target population (See Annex 4)
The benefits of the program include the following:
(a) Increased in enrollment in basic education by 168,000 additional students (about 121,000 in grades 1-
6 and 47, 000 in grades 7-9);
(b) Lower cost per student per year by expanding double shift and multigrade teaching as follows:
- 20% lower in grades 1-6 (declining from 580 to 450 dalasi per student),
- 48% lower in grades 7-9 (declining from 1,550 to 800 dalasi per student), and
-  9% lower in grades 10-12 (declining from 1,300 to 1,200 dalasi per student),
resulting in a total savings of almost 400 million over the 8 year period (average of 40 - 50 million/year),
or a 19% reduction in total government recurrent expenditure over the 8 years relative to what it would be
without the proposed efficiency targets.
(c) An estimated 82% of students entering grade 1 completing grade 6 compared with 76% without the
program.
(d) A 7% reduction in the cost per grade 6 completed.
(e) Lowering the fees for upper basic and secondary education are estimated to reduce the private cost of
education to the poor as follows:
Grades 7-9:  Quintile 1 from 62% to 45% of per capita income
Quintile 2 from 49% to 36% of per capita income
Grades 10- 12: Quintile 1 from 85% to 53% of per capita income
Quintile 2 from 68% to 43% of per capita income
(f) The private cost of girl's education to the poorest will be reduced to only the direct cost of supplies
and uniforms, tuition charges and book fees will be financed through a scholarship of scheme.
(g) It is difficult to estimate the learning achievement gains expected at the outset since baseline

information is lacking. However, a 1:1 student:book ratio, a reduction in the percentage of unqualified
teachers, and strengthened in-service teaching are expected to result in improvements in achievement.
(h) Other benefits expected over the life of the program: (a) Greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness of
public expenditure; (c) more effective implementation of education policy; and (d) a new generation of
Gambians able to utilize computer technology.
Achievement of these benefits will be measured based on program indicators of access to
educational services, the use and quality of those services, the internal and external efficiency of the
system, and public expenditure.
Target Populations and Institutions:
*  Children in the age group 7-15, particularly girls and the poor
*  Illiterate adolescents and adults, particularly women, in the age group 15-35
*  Post basic education students (ages 16-22)
*  Geographically, in order of priority: Upper River Division, Central River Division, Lower River
Division, North Bank Division, Western Division
*  Teachers and headmasters
*  NGOs/private sector
* Government, grant aided and private schools
4.    Institutional and implementation arrangements
Implementation period: 4 years, disbursed over 4.5 years -- 1998/99-2001/02
Executing agency: Department of State for Education (DoSE)
Program coordination: Oversight of policy and program implementation is the responsibility of
the Senior Management Team of the DoSE, which will review implementation on a monthly basis. It is
comprised of all DoSE directors and coordinated by the Permanent Secretary. A Project Coordinating
Committee, comprised of representatives from the Departments of State for Finance, Education, Health,
Trade and Employment, the Personnel Management Office and the Gambia College, chaired by the
DoSE, has been created to provide overall policy guidance for the program. Also, a Coordination
Committee has been established for the purposes of monitoring progress on the ground and ensuring that
the various linkages between the components of the program are functioning. The Coordination
Committee consists of all Directors and the Principal Education Officers in the regions and the heads of
WAEC and the School of Education of the Gambia College. It will convene on a monthly or bimonthly
basis, depending on the need. Divisional Education Committees review progress and issues at the
regional level. The committees already exist but will be given more specific terms of reference drawn up
by the Senior Management Team to provide upward feedback to the Coordinating Committee.
Government is in the process of developing a framework for decentralization. Thus over time, the roles of
the central and local levels are likely to change and these mechanisms will need to be adapted to
accommodate those changes.
The Project Coordination Unit in the DoSE will be responsible for communicating with donors,
coordinating all program inputs, controlling the consistency of program expenditure with the approved
annual programs, procurement, ensuring adherence to legal agreements, financial management of IDA
funds, and submitting financial audits and semi-annual reports to participating donors.

Partner coordination: During appraisal, the DoSE convened partners to discuss modalities for
partner coordination during which the DoSE decided that partner coordination would be the responsibility
of a five person team (the coordinator of the DoSE, a representative each of the external financing
partners (which would rotate annually), the NGO community, the Department of State for Finance and
Economic Affairs, and the Office of the President). The team is being constituted and is drawing up
terms of reference for its work. It was also agreed that partner coordination meetings would take place at
four month intervals and that the DoSE will organize annual meetings of all participating partners and the
Department of State for Finance in May/June of each year to review: (a) progress in the implementation
of the program, (b) sector staffing and expenditure, (c) the program of activities and budget for the
following school year to be endorsed by participating development partners, and (d) a draft public
development and recurrent budget for the next school year.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: The Planning, Policy Analysis, Research and
Budgeting Directorate (PPARBD) of the DoSE will update annually the set of quantitative monitoring
indicators in Annex 4 pertaining to achievements in access, internal efficiency, double-shift and
multigrade expansion, resource utilization and expenditure, budgets, and the availability and use of
instructional materials. To assist the PPARBD with this work a Management Information System
combining financial, teacher records and education statistics is planned to be developed and operational
by 2001/02. In the meanwhile, the PPARBD will continue to use its existing education statistics system,
and the expenditure model developed during the Public Expenditure Review process. A national system
to assess student learning achievement in grades 3 and 5 will be put in place by school year 2000/1 which
will set minimum learning standards, and permit the monitoring of improvements overtime. WAEC,
under contract with the DoSE, will be responsible for conducting the assessments and publishing the
results. The Human Resource Directorate will prepare annual plans and reports on the capacity building
program. Several evaluation studies and technical audits for the new and pilot projecis will be conducted
(Annex 4).
Reporting. The PCU shall furnish to IDA: (i) not later that October 31 of each year a mid-year
program progress; (ii) not later than April 30 each year a yearly report of progress achieved in the
implementation of the Program during the previous academic year having regard to the monitoring
indicators, and including a work plan and budget for the following year in preparation for the annual
review in May of each year and for the mid-term term review in May 2000, and (iii) a completion report
3 months prior to credit closing.
Financial Management Arrangements: The PCU in the DoSE will manage and maintain adequate
financial systems -- including accounting, financial reporting, and auditing -- to ensure that adequate and
timely information with respect to project resources is available. Financial management arrangements
will include: (i) accounting based on project Chart of Accounts to classify expenditures by program
components and sub-components, disbursement categories and sources of funds, and appropriate
reporting formats; (ii) arrangements for recording monitorable output indicators for comparison with
related costs; (iii) procurement contract management information; and (iv) internal control arrangements
to ensure proper segregation of duties, procedures for authorizations, and supervision.
Accounting. The PCU will be responsible for the preparation of the financial statements of the
project, including those for the Special Account (SA) and the Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). The
PCU has an accounting unit, composed of a Senior Accountant and an Assistant which has built capacity
through the preceding projects and has a good track record. The PCU's capacity to manage the funds for
the new program were assessed by a Bank financial management specialist and found to be adequate.
The unit has a sufficiently comprehensive computerized accounting system and an accounting manual

Country: Gambia                                                                       Page 15
.Certain modifications need to be made to the accounting manual and the computerized accounting
system needs to be adjusted for this proposed program. Modifications to the computerized system are in
progress and transmission of the accounting manual, acceptable to IDA, is a condition of credit
effectiveness.
Auditing. The review of the past audits of the Second Education Project managed by the PCU
during the last six years, shows that the PCU consistently sent audits on time to IDA. No audits were
qualified, and the Bank regularly expressed positive opinions on the financial management. An
independent auditor, acceptable to IDA, will be recruited to audit the IDA special account and SOEs. In
cases of co-financing, all expenditure will be audited. The appointment of the auditor is a condition of
credit effectiveness.
D. Project Rationale
1.    Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
Two main alternatives were considered. Alternative I considered a project approach whereby
IDA would support basic education only. This was largely the approach taken previously and it
presented several disadvantages. First, all donors focused only on basic education financed through
separate small projects. This had two negative effects: (a) public development expenditure was oriented
towards other levels of education; and (b) the development of the sector as a whole was not monitored,
the focus being on providing donors with information on specific projects. Moreover, all levels of
education are pedagogically linked to each other and they all share the same budgetary allocation.
Development of one sub-sector while disregarding the others can result in a poor mix of labor force skills
and poorly calibrated allocations of public expenditure. Therefore, the proposal is to support a sector-
wide program within a defined public expenditure framework.
Alternative 2 concerns the choice of lending instrument. The program has characteristics that
lend themselves to an Adaptable Program Lending Instrument (APL) moving towards a Sector
Investment Program (SIP). These include the following. (a) The program is sector wide in scope,
encompassing all levels of education, with clear priority given to basic education, and to certain priority
programs within the other levels of education. (b) It contains a mix of well identified overall objectives,
policies and strategies but requires further refinements of these and additional conceptual work, planning,
programming and budgeting ( most notably in VET and higher education). This requires capacity which
does not exist at present but which will be built as the program progresses. (c) Medium and long-term
public expenditure plans have been estimated taking into account the macroeconomic framework and the
recent PFP agreements with the IMF. Elements of a SIP that are not present include: (a) Strong donor
coordination by the DoSE, (b) strong management, monitoring and evaluation capacity, (c) common
implementation arrangements across development partners, and (d) clearly defined support by all other
development partners. The latter is due in part to the limited number of multilateral and bilateral partners
interested in supporting the sector and to the uncertainty of the timing of their support. To address this
issue, the Government with UNDP support is organizing a Social Sector Round Table in July 1998 to
obtain a clearer picture of the support possible.
Given the above, the decision meetings recommended a combined approach of: (a) fixing IDA
financing for the first two years of the first phase of the program along the lines of a Specific Investment
Credit, while maintaining flexibility to shift financing during annual reviews to allow for the entry of
other development partners who may have specific priorities or constraints, (b) for the purposes of the
legal agreement, leaving a certain share of financing unallocated to cover the second two years of the first
phase which would be allocated during annual reviews.

Based on these recommendations, for the purposes of implementation and supervision, the first 4-
year phase is costed in detail and IDA financing is targeted towards specific programs and expenditure
categories. Confirmation of these allocations or reallocations across categories will take place during the
annual reviews and will be confirmed in the aide-memoires of the annual reviews. At the same time, the
capacity of the DoSE to manage a SIP will be built focusing notably on donor coordination, annual
budgeting and expenditure monitoring, and developing common implementation and reporting
arrangements among development partners.

3.      Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
Based on the implementation of the First and Second Education Projects and those financed by
other donors, the following main lessons were learned:
(a) A project approach to the development of the sector led to insufficient ownership and integration of
project activities into the DoSE's work program. The program attempts to address this by taking a
sector-wide approach and establishing a financial framework to support it.
(b) The lack of clear policy objectives and cost considerations regarding subsidies made some programs
unsustainable on a larger scale (e.g. teacher training, school bus services). The program addresses
this by targeting subsidies towards the poor and lowering subsidies at the post-primary level.
(c) Overall weak management, planning, monitoring and evaluation combined with a lack of
consultation with stakeholders resulted in poorly mapped out strategies and implementation plans,
lack of clearly defined responsibilities, the questioning of some new strategies (e.g. double shift
teaching), and incomplete implementation or a reversal of the policy decision. The proposed
program addresses these issues through: (a) extensive stakeholder consultations upstream and



Project Appraisal Document                                 Project Title: Third Education Sector Program
Country: Gambia                                                                      Page 18
planned throughout implementation, (b) preparation of annual implementation plans, (c) annual
reviews of program implementation, and (c) strengthening planning, monitoring, evaluation and
management capacities.
(d) Capacity building has had limited success. Capacity was conceived narrowly as a shortage of skills
and was therefore addressed only by the borrowing of skills through technical assistance and by
training. Even this limited capacity building did not work well: long-term technical assistants were
underutilized and no arrangements were made to ensure transfer of knowledge to Gambian
counterparts. Training was not based on a strategy for sector improvement, or on considered
priorities and was, therefore, often ad hoc. The proposed program addresses these issues by
approaching capacity as a broader, more holistic, yet very operational concept. It deals with all of the
components of capacity: organization, leadership & Management, financial resources, human
resources, material resources and practices.
4.    Indications of borrower commitment and ownership
Commitment and ownership has been demonstrated in a variety of ways. (a) The DoSE has
demonstrated its willingness to be in the driver's seat. The revised policy framework, investment
program and implementation plan, supported by a public expenditure review -- were prepared by the
DoSE with no input from technical assistants. The DoSE held consultations with donors, NGOs, teachers,
the National Assembly, local Government, and the Cabinet throughout preparation. (b) On a more general
level, education has a high priority in the national development agenda as indicated in pronouncements
and as reflected in high budgetary allocations to the sector. To ensure high level commitment, The
Revised Policy Framework and investment program were discussed with and approved by the National
Assembly. A cabinet paper is being finalized for discussion at that level and to obtain commitments on
budgetary allocations. (c) In terms of commitment to implement difficult policy decisions, steps have
already been taken to remove excess unqualified teachers, expand double-shift teaching, increase
expenditure on textbooks, and freeze subsidies on examinations and the school bus service.
S.     Value added of Bank support in this project
The Bank is the main external financier of education in The Gambia. It has historically played a
key role technically and financially. According to the DoSE, the value added of Bank support in the
sector is assisting the DoSE to clarify its ideas, focus on priority areas, and bring to bear in discussions of
policy and strategies global comparisons and experience from other countries. The Bank is considered as
offering value added in improving the quality of the product developed and in lending credibility to the
program. The Bank's emphasis on cost-benefit considerations and efficiency is also considered
advantageous.
E. Summary Project Analyses (Detailed assessments are in the Project File, see Annex 8)
1.    Economic (Covered in Section 3 and supported by Annex 4)
Using data available from household surveys and education statistics, the Government has
estimated a private and social rate of return to primary and secondary education. The social rate of return
is estimated at about 34%, 12% and 16% for individuals with some basic, secondary and (formal)
vocational and technical education, respectively. Private rates of return are estimated at 37%, 13% and
24% respectively, suggesting that subsidies could be reduced for vocational and technical education.
Savings due to double-shift and multigrade teaching are expected to average about 40 million dalasi/year
or a 19% reduction in Government recurrent expenditure relative to what it would be without the

Country: Gambia                                                                      Page 19
program. Due to this plus a lower repetition and drop rate, the cost of the basic education is estimated to
be about 7% lower than it would be if repetition and drop out rates continued at their current levels.
2.     Fiscal (see Annex 4)
Under IMF assumptions about growth rates of GDP and Government recurrent expenditure, the
recurrent cost impact of the program was estimated under a minimum of 7 different scenarios which are
reported in Annex 4. The main conclusions are: (1) the program is affordable in the medium term only if
immediate action is taken to reduce excess teaching personnel. If all proposed cost saving measures are
implemented, and if education's share of the Government budget is to remain at its current level, an
additional amount of about 11 million dalasi a year will be required to support recurrent costs. About half
of this can be obtained by: (a) freezing expenditure on examinations, school bus service and school
lunches. The remainder could be covered by external financing for textbooks and scholarships for girls.
However, if education's share of Government recurrent expenditure (excluding interest payments) is
allowed to increase from 24.3% at present to about 28% in the medium term and remain at about that
level to the year 2005, the recurrent costs of the program could be financed entirely by Government,
provided that all proposed cost saving measures are implemented. During appraisal, the DoSFEA agreed
to give priority to education on condition that the sector implements all the efficiency measures proposed
in the Public Expenditure Review and considers further cuts in the near future concerning subsidies to the
school bus service and examinations.
3.     Technical
Most technical issues are ones of institutional capacity and are, therefore treated in the
institutional assessment below.
4.    Institutional
An institutional assessment was undertaken to determine (a) if the Government has core capacity
to start implementing Phase I of the program, (b) what further capacity needs to be built during this
phase to strengthen the Government for implementing Phase II activities, and (c) what can be done not
just for the sake of better implementation of this program, but for the improvement of long-term capacity
to deliver educational services. (See Annex 5.)
Few generalizations can be made with respect to the capacity of the education as whole.
Capacity differs from organization to organization and from unit to unit. Nevertheless, the appraisal team
concluded that, in general, the Government will be able to start implementing the proposed sector
program, provided that the program builds up gradually and that necessary steps are taken during Phase I
to close gaps in core capacity. Below is a description of the most important core capacity gaps and the
steps that were agreed and, in some cases already implemented.
Most activities which form part of the development program have an adequate organizational
home. However, the functions of curriculum development and in-service teacher training have been
placed at an inadequate organizational home (The Gambia College). The concern is that the Gambia
College cannot adequately manage these functions on behalf of the DoSE, due both to its own managerial
weaknesses and to its semi-autonomous status. The capacity to develop curricula and ensure professional
development of teachers, each of which involve a number of units within the DoSE, will be constrained if
the management responsibility for them lies outside the DoSE. Since the DoSE prefers this arrangement,
it was agreed that Government would enter into a contractual relationship with the Gambia College to

Country: Gambia                                                                       Page 20
provide these services, while the DoSE will retain management control. A draft agreement has been
prepared. Transmission of the final signed version, acceptable to IDA, is a condition of credit
effectiveness.
The restructuring brought into being new directorates, new units and a new division of labor
among them. The activities generated by the proposed development program had to be allocated among
the new organizational units. This raised concern that the units and staff would not be clear about their
responsibilities. The DoSE has therefore developed new terms of reference for each directorate and unit,
as well as job descriptions for each management position, which include specific activities, time-bound
objectives, and management responsibility for each program activity.
Although the management of the DoSE has progressed significantly in recent years, further
management and leadership development is needed. The need would have existed even before the
proposed program was developed; but the restructuring brought many inexperienced staff into
management positions, and the program has widened the scope of many positions creating a capacity gap.
To address this gap, the DoSE has included an extensive management development training component in
the program.
Implementation of the program also depends greatly on the availability of highly specialized
educational and technical skills of which there is a general shortage. Due to this gap, the program
includes large TA and specialized training components. Most TA is aimed at addressing immediate
needs in Phase I, while specialized training is aimed at addressing longer-term needs to fill gaps during
Phase II. The need for TA was taken as an indicator of a need to build longer term capacity. Thus,
priority is given to training for specialized skills in areas where TA is provided.
The capacity of some units in the DoSE is limited by their work practices. One key practice
common to all units is weak coordination of work. Every unit depends on some input from other units and
provides some input to others - be it information, decision, or some material resource. To address this
issue, the DoSE required each unit to identify all other units on whom it depends for an input, negotiate
with them 'terms of delivery' of the said input, agree on a monitoring mechanism, and produce a unit
coordination plan.
The capacity to implement this program depends, among other things, on the availability of
operational funds to cover recurrent costs. All directorates and units were requested to provide careful
estimates of the required funds, and these were checked wherever possible against a systematic work load
analysis. Wherever it was found that operational funds were inadequate, additional funds were allocated,
work practices were changed, or the activities were spread over a longer period of time.
5.     Social
Equity is expected to improve by lowering the cost of basic and secondary education generally,
for girls in particular, and better targeting of school lunch program towards the poorest regions. Due to a
reduction in fees in basic and secondary education, the average direct cost of education for parents
(excluding lunch) is estimated to decline from about 230 to 200 dalasi for grades 1- 6 (from 13% to 10%
of per capita income of the lowest two quintiles), from about 1,000 to 850 dalasi for grades 7-9 (from
50% to 40% of per capita income of the two lowest quintiles) and in secondary school from about 1,400
to 1,000 dalasi (from 75% to 48% of per capita income of the two lowest quintiles). Although education
in grades 7-9 and 10-12 will remain expensive for the poorest, full scholarships for girls will lower the
family's direct cost of educating their daughters in grades 7-9 and 10-12 to 0.

The environmental impact should be positive. Rum palm trees which are rapidly disappearing
will not be utilized in the construction of classrooms, while the sanitary environment in the schools will
be improved.

Local groups and NGOs consulted include: all NGOs active in education Action Aid, Future in
Our Hands, Christian Children' s Fund, Catholic Relief Services, Principal Education Officers,
Headmasters, Teachers' Union, DoSFEA, Local Government, and Village Development Committees.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1.     Factors critical to the sustainability ofproject benefits are:
*  Political commitment to the objectives of the program
*  Parallel programs, supported by off-budget expenditure, will not be established
*  Maintenance of infrastructure
*  Capacity of the DoSE to manage its human and financial resources
*  Appropriate budgetary allocations
*  Improved civil service selection procedures coupled with appropriate incentives and performance
based evaluation
*  Establishing effective partnerships between 'Government, NGOs, communities, madrassas and grant-
aided schools
*  Implementation of cost reduction measures proposed in the program, particularly to control
recruitment of excess personnel
*  Continued stakeholder consultation and feedback

3.       Possible controversial aspect
Discussions so far with a broad spectrum of stakeholders have not revealed any particular
controversial aspects. However, on the DoSE side the following appear difficult: (i) Increasing cost
recovery in higher education may prove controversial not so much because students will protest but
because a decision was made by the Scholarship Board to fully subsidize 50% students in the university
extension program despite plans to charge tuition at a level of full cost recovery. (ii) Reducing the
subsidy to the Gambia Transport Authority for the school bus service and reducing the subsidy to WAEC
are seemingly difficult for the DoSE for reasons that are not entirely clear.

existing facilities, the construction of new facilities, the establishment of linkages between Madrassa education and the
formal system, the expansion of opportunities for the disabled, an improvement in the supply and deployment of teachers,
and the provision of school lunches.

THE GAMBIA
THIRD EDUCATION SECTOR PROGRAM
Annex 2: Program Description
Component 1: Basic Education Expansion Program
Strategies to achieve the enrollment target of 90% will combine:(a) better use of existing
facilities by expanding double-shift and multi-grade teaching and providing support to madrassas; (b)
construction of new facilities and rehabilitation of old ones; (c) provision of adequate supply of trained
teachers, (d) increasing enrollment in the poorest communities, and (e) improving services for the
disabled.
Sub-component 1: Expand Access through efficient use of existing facilities
Scope and objectives. Double shift teaching will include grades 2-5 in schools in Kombo Saint
Mary's Division; Kombo North, South and Central; Essau; Farafenni; Soma; Brikama-Ba; Bansang; and
Kobakunda to reach additional 1425 classes (57,000 additional places). It is estimated that by 2005 the
percentage of classes double-shifting will increase: (i) in grades 1-6, from 10% of all classes to about
30%, (ii) in grades 7-9, from 30% of all classes to 50%, and, (iii) in secondary schools from 10% to
50%. Multi-grade will be expanded in Upper River Division, Lower River Division and Central River
Division to increase average class size to a minimum of 35 and maximum of 45. Eighty-five (85)
schools in regions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 have been identified to start. Support will be provided to madrassas
to encourage the integration of the formal school curriculum, and special needs education will be
extended to rural areas by main streaming mildly disabled children into regular classrooms. The plan for
the severely disabled will be developed following the analysis of a recently completed survey.
Description. For double-shift and multigrade teaching, teacher training modules will be
developed and implemented for pre- and in-service teacher training covering all teachers involved. For
the madrassa program, the DoSE will: (a) include the madrassas in the gathering of annual education
statistics, (b) hold regular consultations with the madrassas to determine their needs and establish a
partnership, (c) provide technical support to madrassas for curriculum development to bring their
curricula more in line with the national curriculum, and (d) provide English teachers (estimated at 100
for 17,000 students), and English textbooks under the same conditions as they are provided in
Government schools. For special needs students, in the first phase, the DoSE will: (a) fornulate a plan
for a cost-effective service delivery system for the future, (b) establish a simple system of identification
and registration of disabled children, and (c) deveiop teacher training modules to enable teachers to deal
effectively with mainstreamed disabled children.
Implementation responsibilities. Principal Education Officers (PEOs) will be responsible for
identifying multigrade and double-shift classrooms. The Gambia College will develop and provide the
training modules in pre- and in-service teacher training. The DoSE has appointed a madrassa coordinator
who, with the assistance of PEOs, will implement the madrassa program.
Data on the madrassas will be collected by the PPARBD.
Phase 1 will focus on achieving an immediate increase in student:teacher ratios from 30:1 in
grades 1-6, and from 17:1 to 35:1 in grades 7-9 in order to make expansion financially sustainable in the
medium term. This will result from : (i) increasing double-shift classes from 10% to 25% for grades 1-6

Country: Gambia                                                      Annex 2 - Page 2 of 15
and from 30% to 40% for grades 7-9; (ii) expanding multi-grade teaching in 85 schools in regions 2-6 to
reach an average class size of between 35 and 45 pupils. Main interventions to support madrassa
education will include: (iii) including data on the madrassas in the Annual Education Statistics, and (ii)
posting of about 100 English teachers to those schools. The program supported by UNICEF for disabled
children will continue and includes over the next four years: (i) conducting survey of disabled children,
and (ii) developing a systems of identification and registration of disabled children, and (iii)
mainstreaming the mildly disabled into regular classrooms. After the third year of implementation, an
evaluation of double-shift and multi-grade teaching and an assessment of the effectiveness of the co-
operation between the madrassas and the DoSE and their willingness to work on curriculum revision will
be conducted.
Phase 2 will proceed to expand double-shift and multi-grade teaching where there is the need
and the strategy adjusted in accordance with results of the evaluation. Teacher training for those
involved in multigrade and double-shift teaching will continue. With regards to the Madrassas,
additional English teachers and books and technical assistance to modify the madrassa curricula to better
align them to the national curriculum (particularly in a math and science) will be provided in accordance
with demand. For the severely disabled, additional facilities would be constructed depending on the
results of the survey.
Sub-Component 2: Classroom Construction and Rehabilitation
Scope and objectives. Basic cycle schools will require an estimated 3,100 new classrooms and
accompanying facilities (2,400 and 700 for the lower and upper cycles respectively) including the
replacement of 600 temporary classrooms, or about 380 per year, along with accompanying facilities
over the next 8 years. Of these, government will construct 3,000 and the rest is assumed to be done by
private and grant aided schools. Rehabilitation needs and a school maintenance system will be
established.
Description. Given the size of the program relative to past experience, all available construction
capacities will be mobilized for construction management, involving a Contract Management Agency
(GAMWORKS), NGOs, and communities with different strategies for more and less densely populated
areas. In more densely populated areas, a contract management approach with GAMWORKS will be
used with Government financing 10% of the construction cost. In rural areas, NGO and community
management will be used and communities would cover 5% of the value of the construction in cash or in
kind. In all instances, a bottom up approach to planning school locations will be used, starting with a
request from the community, verified against the criteria for the establishment of new classrooms at the
divisional and central levels. It is assumed that NGOs will finance an estimated 7% of the classroom
needs using their own funding.
In addition to construction and furnishings, the program will support community mobilization,
capacity building of the regional PEOs for school mapping, of the regional construction coordinators for
construction monitoring and supervision, and at the central level (PCU) to enable it to shift from direct
construction contract management to program management through delegation of authority to
implementing agencies, and quality assurance.
Implementation/Responsibilities: On the basis of school-mapping criteria, technical criteria
developed during preparation, the PPARBD will prepare the annual school building programs and
ensure country wide dissemination of information about community eligibility and priority criteria for
benefiting from the program. The PCU will be responsible for determining the quality and the standard

of the classrooms to be built, the management of contracts with GAMWORKS and NGOs, and
monitoring and evaluation of the program.
Phase 1 will focus on completing half the construction program, and developing a rehabilitation
program and maintenance system. The construction program includes 1,570 new lower basic and 314
new upper basic classrooms, and associated facilities (latrines, offices, and laboratories for upper basic
schools). To link expansion of upper basic with the plan to phase out the PSLC, upper basic classrooms
will first be built in regions 5 and 6, thereafter in regions 3 and 4. Also planned is the construction of 5
senior and 5 junior staff quarters in new upper Basic school in remote areas, to be allocated according to
a staff housing policy to be developed as part of a study on teacher and civil service incentives/reform
and which will be costed and approved by Government. Classroom needs (based on an assessment of
revised population growth) and the performance of GAMWORKS and the NGOs will be assessed at the
end of year 2 of the program and the strategy revised accordingly. A rehabilitation plan and
maintenance policy will also be developed during phase 1.
Phase 2 will focus on (a) completing the construction program (1120 lower basic classrooms in
regions 1-6 and 370 upper Basic classrooms) and adjusting the management strategy if appropriate, (b)
implementing a maintenance strategy, and (c) executing the rehabilitation program developed in phase 1.
Sub-Component 3 - Provision of adequate supply of trained teachers
Scope and Objectives. The main objectives are: (a) ensure an adequate supply of trained
teachers for all new positions in a cost-effective way, (b) reduce the percentage of unqualified teachers
in the system from the present 42 % to 20%, and (c) increase the percentage of female teachers in
training from 30% in 1996/1997 to 40% by the end of the policy period. Based on projected needs, for
the lower Basic (grades I - 6) the sector will need 3,332 new teachers trained from which 2,240 are for
the upper Basic (grades 7 - 9).
Description. To achieve these objectives, the Gambia College will need to more than double its
intake in the PTC program from about 120 at present to between 300 and 425 a year and from 60 in the
HTC to 150 - 230 a year, depending on the year. To achieve this cost effectively, the program contains
the following policy measures: (a) phasing out of specialist HTC teachers so that teachers are able to
teach at least two subjects, (b) changing pre-service PTC training from a 2 year residential program to
one year residential and two years of school based training, (b) privatizing the Gambia College canteen
and renting out of accommodation to students.
On the investment side, the program includes: (a) expansion of facilities at the Gambia College,
(b) additional staff for the residential and school-based components, (c) development and
implementation of distance education modules for teachers in their school-based training, (d) an
information system for student registration and tracking, (e) development of Educational Management
and Administration Courses, and (f) capacity building of Gambia College staff including upgrading to
Masters and PhD level, and study visits to other countries for, inter alia, distance education methods and
teaching English as a second language.
To increase the number of female teachers, the Gambia College will continue the successful
Remedial Initiative for Female Trainees (RIFT) program begun about 4 years ago. This program takes in
about 50 women a year who were unable to meet the cut of grade for entry and provides them with
remedial instruction to upgrade their academic background.

Implementation/Responsibilities. The Gambia College will be responsible for designing and
delivering the teacher training. For the school-based component, a Training Officer will be posted to
Regions 3 - 6 to co-ordinate the program and supervise the trainees, while college based staff will
supervise training in Regions one and two. Head Masters / Mistresses and subject Heads in the case of
upper-Basic level will be responsible for day-to-day supervision and assessment of trainees in their
Schools. The PCU will be responsible of the constructions through the GAMWORKS.
Phase 1 will focus on building the capacity of the Gambia College to accommodate an intake of
400 by the end of phase I and develop an effective school-based program using distance education.
Intake into the PTC program for the academic year 1998/99 would increase at a more manageable level
(from 120 to 180) with students following the traditional PTC program while the 3 year program with
distance education is prepared for implementation with the cohort starting in 1999/2000. Between
1999/2000-2001/02, annual intake will increase to 225, 300 and 350. In 1998, intake into the HTC
program will increase from 60 to 120 and gradually build up depending on needs. To build up this
capacity phase 1 includes: (a) the construction and the equipment of staff offices, 8 lecture rooms, 3
science and technology laboratories and one computer laboratory; and the expansion of the library, (b)
appointment of additional staff including 4 regional training officers, (c) development, implementation
and evaluation of the distance education component, and (d) development and installation of a
computerized student registration and tracking system. To support this program a substantial capacity
building package including technical assistance and training will be provided. Technical assistance will
be provided to: (i) develop, implement and evaluate the distance education component, (ii) develop,
install and train Gambia College staff on the computerized student registration system, and (iii) develop
multigrade and double-shift teacher training modules. All Gambia College staff will be trained in the
use of computers, and at least 3 will be trained abroad to the Masters and Doctoral levels. The Remedial
Program to Increase Female Teachers (RIFT) started in 1992 will also continue during phase 1 until
such time as females comprise 40% of intake into the PTC program. To lower the cost of training,
Government will privatize the restaurant services, charge rent for accommodations and introduce tuition
charges by the end of phase 1.
Phase 2 will focus on improving the distance education component and increasing the intake
into the HTC program using a similar method (in this case, 2 year residential 1 year school-based using
distance education) depending on the results of the PTC program. Physical facilities will be expanded
and more Gambia College staff will be trained to Masters and Doctoral degree levels. Specialized
modules will be developed for training teachers to deal with disabled students.
Sub-Component 4 - Increasing enrollment of low income children
Scope and Objectives . To increase the enrollment of low income children, the Government
would: (a) in lower basic education, eliminate the textbook rental fee; in upper basic, reduce enrollment
tuition from 150 to 100 dalasi per term and in secondary from 250 to 200 dalasi per term, and (c) target
subsidized school lunches towards the poorest communities.
Description. Through the School Feeding Program, the World Food Program (WFP) currently
assists in providing lunches to about 60,000 students while Government finances 10% of program costs.
In order to better target the subsidy to the poorest, the SFP will phase out urban centers where school
canteens will be set up and provide larger coverage of subsidized meals in regions 3-6. The program
will provide food commodities through the WFP, kitchen utensils to the poorest communities, and
support for training in management, monitoring and evaluation. It is envisaged that the School Feeding
Program will pursue these objectives through a process involving the beneficiaries in planning,

implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
Implementation/Responsibilities. The DoSE will ensure the implementation of this program
through its partnership with WFP and other donor agencies in the provision of food commodities and
non-food items. The School Farms and Gardens Unit will be responsible for the management of the
program while the PEOs will ensure proper delivery of the food commodities. Opening of canteens by
the private sector will be encouraged.
Phase 1 will focus on provision of lunches to 60,000 children in grades 1-6 in regions 2-6 for
162 days in the year. The SFP will be phased out in region 2 and in all growth centers from 1999.
Communities will be mobilized for participation in SFP and the school canteen system and privately run
school canteens introduced. The assessment of the latter will be conducted and a study on the impact of
the school feeding carried out in year 3 of the program.
The program for Phase 2 is uncertain given the cut backs envisaged in the WFP during this
period. It is likely that phase 2 will need to focus on developing a more limited, better targeted and
sustainable strategy to be implemented towards the end of this phase.
Component 2 - Girls' Education Program
Strategies to address gender issues are taken into account in the teacher training, instructional
materials, and construction program which will ensure the construction of separate latrines for girls. In
addition to these interventions, the program will: (a) lower the cost of education for girls at upper basic
and secondary levels and encourage flexible payment of fees, (b) develop and enforce sexual harassment
policies at schools, (c) provide personal and career counseling for girls, and (d) mobilize communities
to develop local solutions to the education problems of girls in their communities.
Scope and Objectives. The long run objective is to achieve gender equity in access to education,
and increased retention and performance rates of girls, particularly in rural communities.
Description. With the elimination of the book rental fee, lower basic education will be free. In
upper Basic, 30% of girls in the poorest communities in Regions 2-6 will receive scholarships covering
tuition, book and exam fees which total 450 dalasi/year per beneficiary in grades 7 and 8, and 600 dalasi
in grade 9. Payments for tuition will be made directly to the school, for books directly into the revolving
fund account, and for exams directly to WAEC to facilitate administration. There is also some proposal
to provide scholarships for upper basic education to needy girls in regions I and 2, needy secondary
school girls country wide, and 10% of girls who excel in math, science and technology. The Master
Plan is unclear on these. Greater clarity is needed on: (a) the number of recipients involved, (b) the
phasing of the scholarships for secondary education, for needy girls in regions I and 2, and girls
excelling in math, science and technology, (c) the estimated cost of the program, (d) the criteria and
process to be used to identify recipients, and (e) the administration of the scheme. To address these
issues, the DoSE intends to recruit a consultant to propose design, targeting and administration options,
as well as cost estimates of the options, based on which it will finalize its decisions. Agreement on the
design of the program will be needed before IDA funds are disbursed for the program.
Guidance and counseling which already exists in most upper Basic and Secondary Schools in
the urban and peri-urban areas will be extended to schools not yet reached and to lower Basic. More
teachers will be provided with the skills to offer the required services particularly for girls. For new
entrants to the teaching profession, training modules on guidance and counseling and gender awareness

will form part of the training program.
Community mobilization. Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) work will be implemented
in select communities where girl's enrollment continues to be low to encourage the development and
implementation of local solutions to the problem. Adult literacy programs, the media and traditional
means of communication, such as women's theater groups, will also be used for IEC.
Implementation/Responsibilities. To finance the scholarship program, a trust fund will be set up
by DoSE. The DoSE has appointed a focal point within the BED to co-ordinate activities related to girl's
education and ensure that they are properly monitored and evaluated. The coordinator will also be
responsible for expanding PLA activities, and the development and implementation of IEC programs
designed in collaboration with the Women's Bureau.
Phase 1 will comprise the (a) recruitment of a consultant to set up the targeting criteria and
modalities for administration. (b) The scholarship program will begin in regions 5 and 6 during the first
3 years of phase 1. Following two years of operation, it will be evaluated and expanded to regions 3 and
4, depending on the results and lessons learned. (c) PLA will be conducted in select communities in
Regions 5 and 6 in 2000/01 following the implementation of the scholarship program where girl's
enrollment remains low. Other interventions included in phase 1 are: (d) as part of curriculum review
and revision, reviewing curriculum for gender sensitivity and revising it to reduce gender bias; (d)
conducting a study sexual harassment in schools and developing and implementing a policy to reduce it;
(e) continued adaptation and implementation of teacher training modules on gender issues; (f)
construction of separate latrines for girls in schools where they do not exist; and (g) designing and
implementing an IEC program in collaboration with the Women's Bureau.
Phase 2 will consist of (a) expanding the scholarship program to regions 2-4 and continuation of
PLA work in communities where girl's enrollment remains low, (b) expansion of the scholarship scheme
to secondary schools in regions 3-6; (c) evaluating the impact of the interventions; (d) conducting an
assessment of schools without toilets facilities for girls as part of the school mapping and survey of
school rehabilitation needs, and (e) continued IEC.
Component 3: Improving the Quality and Relevance of Basic Education
The aim of this component is to improve the learning outcomes for all children. The strategy
combines: (a) an evaluation and redesign of the curriculum to make it more focused on learning
outcomes and child-centered, (b) removing gender bias in instructional materials, and (c) ensuring that
all students have access to a full set of books. In -service teacher training will be a regular part of the
program to accompany the innovations in the expansion of multigrade and double-shift teaching,
curriculum revisions, and continuous assessment, and to assist teachers in providing broader services to
students in the areas of guidance and counseling and special needs students. This training is included
under the individual components and sub-components.
Sub-component I - Curriculum improvement
Scope and objectives. The objectives are to: (a) improve the curriculum so that it is: (i) based on
explicit learning objectives upon which assessment can be more reliably based, (ii) and more child
centered which encourages individual learning and teaching styles; (b) re-define the focus of the core
curriculum to cover literacy, numeracy, the arts, life and communication skills, and problem solving in
the context of a healthy lifestyle in a more integrated manner to reduce the number of separate subjects

which crowd the schedule, and (c) pilot the introduction of teaching in national languages in grades I
and 2.
Description. To start, a baseline survey of curriculum materials for the Basic cycle will begin in
1999 from which implicit learning objectives of the existing curriculum will be derived. In a second
stage, they will be assessed against opinions of parents and employers of what students should know and
know how to do upon completion of basic education and from a cross country comparison of basic
education learning objectives. The development process will start with a statement of framework, that is
a scope and sequence chart which incorporates the key learning areas across all grades I to 9 showing
how the syllabus documentation will fit together to provide a coherent educational continuum rather than
a series of discrete chunks. Based on this framework, the syllabus statements will be developed in
stages -- Grades 1/2; Gr. 3/4; Gr. 5/6 and Gr. 7/8/9. The development process will end with the creation
of a Basic Cycle syllabus in each of the key learning areas which is the combination of each of the
separately developed stages. This will be printed and distributed as a single document to which all
teachers from Grades I to 9 would need to refer. All assessment processes will be adjusted to correspond
to these syllabus statements. To assist in this process, a twinning arrangement will be established with
an institution with the relevant expertise that will provide capacity building of the Curriculum
Development Unit which Government has decided to move to the School of Education of the Gambia
College.
Piloting national language instruction for grades I & 2 is an experimental research project to
start instruction in national languages in response to a National Assembly vote to teach in national
languages. Syllabuses and materials are to be developed for grades 1 and 2 by end 2001 for piloting in
academic year 2001/02 in Mandinka, Pulaar and Wollof.
Implementation responsibilities. The curriculum development unit, transferred to the Gambia
College will be responsible for the management of curriculum development. Syllabus development will
be done by panels comprised of select teachers seconded to the panels for a period of 1 to 2 years.
Phase 1 will focus on (a) the integration of the functions of CRPDD in the Gambia College, (b)
review of curriculum to reflect an outcomes based approach in grade 1-9, (c) development of a syllabus
framework for grades 1-9, (c) development and trial testing of outcomes based syllabuses for grades 1-4,
(d) development of textbook manuscripts for grades 1-4, and (d) a study of the options and their costs of
introducing instruction in national languages in grades I and 2 towards the end of phase 1. To build
capacity for curriculum development in the long term and achieve these tasks in the medium term, a
twinning arrangement with an institution competent in outcomes based curriculum development will be
established in the first year of phase I and accompany the process throughout phase 1. At least 1 staff of
curriculum development will study abroad at the Masters or PhD level in curriculum development to
lead the process upon his/her return. The printing of new books will not occur until phase 2.
Phase 2 would include: (a) an evaluation of the revised syllabuses and framework for grades 1-
4, (b) revision and testing of syllabuses for grades 5-9, (c) revision of textbook manuscripts and
publishing of new books, and (d) evaluating, and expanding the national language pilot depending on
results.

Sub-Component 2 - Instructional materials
The objectives of the sub-component are to: (a) ensure that all children have access to a set of
books, and (b) expand the use of teacher made instructional materials.
Description. This sub-component provides support to procure a set of books for all students,
through reprinting about 1.4 million copies of existing books and the preparation and editing of
manuscripts for new books following curriculum revision which will come into the system after 2004 or
2005. A textbook rental scheme for basic education has been in operation for about 6 years. Due to the
many problems encountered with the management of the system and leakage of funds, as well as the
cost to parents, the scheme will be changed for grades 1-6 to provide students a set of books on a no-fee
loan basis. The rental scheme will continue in upper basic but its management will be contracted out to a
private sector management firm. To ensure the smooth functioning of the system, support will be
provided for book storage at schools, training of PEOs and school heads as to their role in the system
and in book conservation, and an infornation campaign for parents and students about the recycling and
rental system.
To continue the printing of teacher's manuals and small print runs, the BPMRU's capacity will
be strengthened with equipment and training while a plan is developed to determine options for the
future, including its privatization to enable it to operate commercially.
Other instructional materials. Teacher resource centers were established in 4 regions with
support from the African Development Bank for in-service training and as locations where teachers meet
to develop instructional materials. The program would: (a) construct and equip two additional resource
centers (Mansa-Konko and Janjanbureh) so that all regions have a center, (b) up-grade existing school-
based resource centers with materials to serve school clusters, and (c) train PEOs, Resource Center
Wardens and School-based Resource Center Attendants in the production of teaching/learning aids and
the management of resources centers.
Implementation/Responsibilities. For textbooks, the Services Directorate has overall
management responsibility for the system while the BPMRU handles book storage and distribution.
Regular Reports on the progress of the scheme will be filed annually by schools and the Services
Directorate giving quantities of books in stock, amount to be replaced/ordered etc. The rental system
will be audited annually.
Phase 1 consists of the following activities: (a) study to define the future status and capacity of
the BPMRU; (b) limited upgrading of the existing equipment of the BPMRU; (c) training of staff
according to decision about the future status and capacity of the BPMRU; (d) construction of two
resource centers at Mansakonko and Janjanbureh and assessment of the condition of other existing
centers; (e) reprinting existing books, (f) adapting the existing operation manual for the textbook rental
system to guide the textbook recycling system for grade 1-6, (g) contracting out the financial
management of the textbook rental system; and (h) evaluations every two years of the recycling and
rental systems.
Phase 2 will (a) continue the development of textbook manuscripts for grades 5-9, (b) publish
new books for grades 1-9 in accordance with syllabus development, and (c) continued monitoring of the
textbook recycling and rental system.

Sub-Component 3 - Examinations and Assessment
Scope and Objectives. The major objectives are to: (a) reduce the cost of examinations, and (b)
establish more reliable assessment procedures that provide information to policy makers and the public
on learning achievement, and (c) improve the quality and usefulness of examinations.
Description. Related to these objectives, the main policies and activities involve: (a) replacing    - --
the grade 6 school leaving certificate exam by the Gambia Basic Education Cycle Examination
(GABECE) which will be the final examination taken at the end of grade 9, (b) establish a sample based
national assessment for grades 3 and 5 for literacy and numeracy, and (c) introduce the West African
Secondary School Leaving Certificate with a continuous assessment component.
National Assessment. The National assessment system will be developed to establish national
learning standards in literacy and numeracy, and test a sample of students against those standards to
establish base line data on learning achievement. The testing will be repeated every 2 years to track
progress over time. The first round of testing for grades three and five will start in 2000/2001 with a
second round of testing in 2003/4. This will allow sufficient time for capacity to be built in the SQAD
and WAEC. This activity will be supported through a long term twinning arrangement with an
international institution with expertise in the area, and appropriate equipment and degree training abroad
for 2 staff in testing and measurement.
Examinations. Given the high cost to Government and parents of the grade 6 exam as
well as the creation of a 9 year basic education cycle, only the grade 9 exam will be retained. Both the
GABECE and the secondary school exam will include a continuous assessment component to enable
teachers to better assess students during the course of the year and to arrive at a fairer assessment of the
accomplishments of the student so that the future of the child is not dependent solely on his/her
performance on exam papers. The program proposes to support capacity building of WAEC in the forrn
of training, examination software and hardware with the aim of reducing printing and processing costs.
Implementation/Responsibilities The development, implementation, analysis and
reporting tasks for the National Assessment have been delegated by the Government to WAEC.
Transmission to IDA of a draft contract for these services is a condition of negotiations.Signature of the
contract is a condition of credit effectiveness.
Phase 1 will include: (a) developing desired national benchmarks for numeracy and
literacy, (b) phasing out the PSLCE in all regions by 2002; (c) development of the National Assessment
system and its introduction in grades 3 and 5 in 2001 and reports published; (d) procurement of software
and hardware to lower the cost of examinations. Significant capacity building will be needed for this
program which will be addressed through a twinning arrangement during phase I and study to the
Masters and Ph.D. levels of two staff in testing and measurement.
Phase 2 will consolidate the program and include: (a) reviewing the national
benchmarks against the new curriculum; (b) conducting a second round of National Assessment testing
and reporting of results.

Component 4: Early Childhood and Development and Care
The objectives for ECDC for the program period are limited until the DoSE has the required
expertise to pursue this area and until a strategy is prepared. Over the next few years, the objectives are
to: (a) develop an ECDC strategy, (b) expand training opportunities for ECDC care givers on basic
knowledge in first aid, child care and special needs education, developmentally appropriate practices, (c)
develop and monitor the application o f guidelines for setting up pre-school centers, (d) encourage
NGOs and other local organizations to support ECDC, and (e) pilot community managed centers in
regions 5 and 6. In adult literacy programs parenting education, health care, nutrition and stimulation
activities will be incorporated. To achieve these objectives, Government will continue to work in
partnership with NGOs, other government departments, private individuals and agencies interested in
ECDC while training of ECDC caregivers will be carried out jointly by Gambia College and the
Association of Early Childhood Education.
Implementation/Responsibilities. The DoSE will work in partnership with the NGOs, other
government departments, private individuals and agencies interested in ECD. Training of ECD
Caregivers will be jointly carried out by the Gambia College and the Association of Early Childhood
Education .
Phase I will focus on (a) strengthening partnership with NGOs, CBOs and the Association of
Early Childhood Education, (b) developing a strategy for ECD; (c) continued training of Care-givers,
and (d) piloting community day care centers in region 5 and 6 and evaluating the results.
Phase 2 will expand the community day care concept if successful in regions 5 and 6, and adopt
and implement the strategy developed in phase 1.
Component 5: Secondary School Development Program
The objectives of this component are to: (a) increase the gross enrollment ratio from 16% to
28% by the year 2005/06 (a transition rate of 50% from basic to secondary education, (b) ensure over
time that all secondary students graduate having acquired basic computer literacy skills, and (c) lower
the cost of education to Government by rationalizing grant-in-aid and increasing the number of Gambian
teachers. The strategies proposed include: (i) construction of 10 new public secondary schools over the
period, (ii) increase girls' enrollment, (iii) increase the capacity of tertiary education to train secondary
school teachers, (iv) introduce computer education programs in all Government schools, and (v)
rationalize the staffing quota and grant-in-aid allocations.
Description. To reach the enrollment objective will require the construction of about 20 schools,
for a total of 420 classrooms, each accommodating an additional 15,000 students. Central Government
will finance 10 schools (210 classrooms), 8 of which will be constructed in towns in regions 3-6 to
provide an equitable distribution of opportunities. The remaining 10 are expected to be built by the
Local Government Councils, the Missions, private individuals and NGOs.
To increase girls' enrollment, the scholarship scheme proposed for upper basic education will
also include secondary education, providing 10% of girls with scholarships to cover the direct costs of
their education.



Project Appraisal Document                             Project Title: Third Education Sector Program
Country: Gambia                                                      Annex 2 - Page 11 of 15
Training of secondary school teachers through the University extension program will more than
double to increase from 25% to about 35% the number of trained Gambians in the teaching force.
Assuming that 40% of classes and teachers double-shift, in Government schools and grant-aided
schools, the teaching force will need to increase by 40 teachers annually at the start and reach 60
annually by 2005/06. Training requirements would be higher due to replacement for attrition and
expatriate teachers. Assuming an attrition rate of 5% of the teaching force, would require training a
minimum average of 50 extra teachers a year, increasing from about 30 at the start to 60 by the end of
the period. For private schools, recruitment needs average around 20 per year over the period. For
Government and grant-aided schools, this amounts to about 800 new recruits over the period, and about
150 for the private sector. Currently, the only tertiary level degree training offered is through the
University Extension Program which trains 25 teachers a year. The capacity will increase to 60 to
accommodate: (a) 30 graduates of secondary school, and (b) upgrading 30 unqualified Gambian teachers
already in the system. Bonding arrangements of government sponsored trained teachers will be
enforced to maintain them as teachers for a period of 5 years.
Computer literacy. A computer literacy program will be introduced in all Government schools to
(a) familiarize students with basic word processing and spreadsheet operations, procedures to access the
Internet and to use the Internet to communicate with other students and teachers around the world, and
(b) to provide a resource to teachers to improve the quality of their teaching. During the policy period,
the-14 existing grant-aided and 10 planned new schools will be fitted with computer systems housed in
laboratories managed by a Computer Literacy teacher. The program will begin in 1999 with a pilot
phase using the 14 existing schools which will be equipped with the necessary hardware, software
(including educational software for subject areas) and Internet connectivity. With class size of 45 and a
ratio of two students to a computer, each laboratory will require 25 computer systems (including one for
the teacher). A set of 42 teachers ( two teachers plus the Principal in each school) will be trained in basic
word processing, spreadsheets, procedures to access the Internet, pedagogical applications of the
Internet and basic system maintenance. These resource teachers will be responsible for training other
teachers in their schools.
In order to reinforce a spirit of project ownership, the management of the computer labs will rest
with the schools and teachers. The Principal of the school will nominate one of the computer literacy
resource teachers to serve as a teacher/co-ordinator to attend to the day to day operation of the lab and
liaise with the Information Technology in Secondary Schools Project Co-ordinator at the DoSE. A lab
attendant will be recruited/appointed by each school and trained in basic system maintenance and
hygiene, and content for the resource teachers' courses. S/he will ensure that the computer systems in
the lab are functioning, supplies are available and the lab is open throughout the day.
For the purpose of monitoring and evaluation, each participating school will: (i) have a teacher
evaluation sheets filled out at the end of each term, (ii) keep reports in log book of computer use
detailing by whom, for what purposes, for how long, the programs used, computer down-time and the
reasons and how quickly the problem was resolved; (iii) keep copies of assignment papers produced
during the term; (iv) keep a record of E-mails volume, and (v) keep records of school expenses related
to the project. Each school will submit a report at the end of each term during the pilot phase containing
this information, emerging issues and suggestions for improvement.
Implementation/Responsibilities. All existing Senior Secondary Schools will be required to
operate double shift using 70% of the teacher staff. Government will be responsible for salaries of
teachers and the 2/3 of their double shift allowance. The school Board will meet 1/3 of the allowance.
Government will establish two Senior Secondary Schools in each of the following regions: URD; CRD;

LRD; NBD and WD. All local government areas councils will be encouraged through partnership to
build and operate at least two others in their administrative regions. With respect the introduction of
computer technology in secondary schools Government and schools will seek partnership with the
private sector to obtain preferential rates for the use of Internet, and for financing computers. The
Gambia is also in the Bank's World Links program.
Phase 1 will consist of: (a) local Government and private sector mobilization for the
construction of 10 secondary schools, (b) provision of 18 equipped computer laboratories in the 14
existing schools., (c) introduction of computer literacy and Internet use courses for all students in grade
12; (d) evaluation of the computer literacy program, (e) reducing school fees, (f) rationalizing and
lowering grant-in-aid, and (g) upgrading 30 HTC teachers will be upgraded to degree levels annually.
To minimize the risk that local Government and area councils may not finance the 10 schools assumed,
the DoSE will strengthen partnerships with local government and encourage the latter to make this a
priority in their development programs, and negotiate with GAMWORKS the inclusion of new
secondary school construction in criteria for priority infrastructure development. Local Government
plans will be evaluated at mid-term to determine the feasibility of meeting the objective of constructing
10 secondary schools.
Phase 2 will include (a) the construction of ten public schools, and (b) expanding computer
literacy classes to grades 10 and 11.
Component 6: Vocational and Technical Education
The objectives for the development of vocational/technical education are not yet well defined.
As a result, in the medium term, they will focus on : (a) setting up a labor marker information system to
improve the collection and analysis of labor market and training data, (b) developing a comprehensive
training policy for the country, (c) making functional the employer levy-training fund, (d) conducting
feasibility studies on introducing rural skills centers and higher level degree training programs, and (e)
build on existing institutions to improve basic skills and mid-level technician training. In the longer
term, the proposal is to expand skills training centers and introduce higher level techniclan training if the
feasibility studies show them to be cost-effective means of providing training.
Skills training. The Banjul Skills Center (BSC) will start short intensive skills training (6-12
months) in outboard motor mechanics and House Wiring, in addition to the existing courses (Carpentry
and Joinery, Welding and Fabrication, and Refrigeration and Air Conditioning). The other facilities of
BSC will be rehabilitated to house the Carpentry and Joinery and Refrigeration and Air Conditioning
sections.
For higher level training, the Government proposes, over the plan period to establish OND,
HND and B.Sc. programs in Technology and an HND program in Civil Engineering/ construction
management. In the longer term, it also proposes to expand the GTTI to enable it to offer higher level
degree programs in Civil Engineering and Electronics, Mechanical Engineering and Computing
Technology. This will require an estimated 8 more lecture blocks including 4 laboratories/ workshops as
well as equipment, and considerable staff training and upgrading. Since the recurrent budget allocated
to the GTTI will not increase, all additional recurrent costs will need to be covered by fees. Before these
programs are introduced, a needs assessment will be conducted to assess the cost-effectiveness of
providing these programs locally compared with the costs of training students abroad.

Implementation/Responsibilities. DoSE/DTEVT will develop a policy framework and set up a
labor market information system. Along with the concerned stakeholders, the DTEVT will work on
making the employer levy training fund operational.
Phase 1 will focus: (a) developing a strategy for VET development, (b) developing a labor
market information system with analyses produced every two years, (c) starting the employer levy
training fund for training activities, (d) upgrading the GTTI certificate program in Technology to OND
and HND programs, and the OND in Civil Engineering to an HND in Civil Engineering/Construction
Management through franchising arrangements, (e) upgrading several GTTI staff to degree level for
these courses, (f) construction, furnishing and equipment of 8 classrooms and 3 laboratories. The EU
has expressed interest in supporting (a) - (c). IDA financing will be considered once a strategy is
developed.
Phase 2 activities will be defined once the VET strategy is developed.
Component 7 - University Education
In the long run, the Government proposes to establish a university with a capacity of 2,000
students that would offer degree programs in Agriculture (B.Sc.), Education (BA and B.Sc.), Health
Sciences and Nursing, Civil Engineering, Construction Management, Technology, Hotel and Tourism
Management, and Business Studies. The strategy proposed to establish a university is to consolidate
existing post-secondary institutions and upgrade their programs to degree level starting with certain
priority areas and phasing in others over time. Given that groundwork still needs to be done, in the
medium term, the Government proposes to focus on: (a) developing the groundwork, (b) starting up a
few degree programs where the needs are well established and cost is affordable, and (c) establishing
computerized student registration, management information and accounting systems.
With respect to the groundwork, the objectives are to: (i) conduct a cost and financing study of
the University Commission's proposal, including capital and recurrent costs by program and financing
options, (ii) develop a 10 year development plan, (iii) develop the curricula and staffing plans for each
program, (iv) develop a coherent management structure and administrative procedures, (v) conduct a
study of regional labor market needs to determine what programs could be offered to attract tuition
paying non-Gambians, and (vi) develop an implementation plan.
While studies are being conducted to develop the long term plan, the following priority
programs will be introduced pending a cost and financing proposal and an implementation plan for the
programs: (i) B.Sc. programs at the Gambia College in Maths, Geography, Biology, Chemistry, Physics,
and Environmental Studies mainly to increase the supply of secondary school science teachers, (ii)
OND, HND and B.Sc. in Technology and HND in construction management, (iii) B. Sc. in
Nursing/Health Sciences, and (iv) a BA program in Business studies at the Management Development
Institute.
Implementation/Responsibilities. An implementation task force has been appointed to plan and
oversee the start up of the University. In the first stage, Gambia College, GTTI and MDI will be
designated as Schools of the University of Gambia. In the course of the implementation of phase I, a
governing council, similar to a Board of Directors, will be set up to set policy and oversee the
management of the institution.

Phase 1 will focus on (a) establishing the legal, management and administration of the
University, (b) conducting the groundwork studies listed above, (c) establishing a computerized student
registration, management information and accounting systems ; (d) starting franchising arrangements
and programs in (i) B. Sc. in Mathematics and Sciences (Geography, Biology, Physics, Environmental
Studies) to increase the output of secondary teachers, (ii) B.Sc. in Health Science/Nursing, and (iii) a
B.A. in Business Studies.
Phase 2 is only tentatively defined and will depend on the groundwork studies. Tentatively, it is
scheduled to include a B.Sc. program in Technology and Civil Engineering and construction of a multi-
purpose complex.
Component 8: Adult Education/Functional Literacy Program
This component is currently being piloted with support from the UNDP. In addition, the Gambia
is participating in the World Bank Africa region's adult literacy program which is supporting a cross-
country analysis of literacy programs to enable participating countries to draw lessons learned and to
develop a program that is suitable to their circumstances. Given the developmental nature of this
component, a notional amount of $0.7 million has been allocated pending the results of the studies which
will guide the development and testing of the program.
Due to the limited capacity of Government and that many Government delivered adult literacy
programs have failed in the past, the Government has opted for a strategy that targets the age group 15-
39 (particularly women) and supports the private sector ( NGOs Community Based Organizations) to
provide the services while Government assumes the responsibility to set criteria for accessing funds,
reviewing proposals against agreed upon and cost-effective criteria in a transparent manner, organizes
capacity building support for the providers, and ensures annual evaluations of the sub-projects as well as
a longitudinal evaluation to assess the program's impact over time and skill retention.
Implementation/Responsibilities. Government will develop a consultation mechanism with
providers and the financing of sub projects that satisfy the established eligibility criteria. ANFED will be
responsible for policy formulation, criteria setting, program planning, management, supervision, and
evaluation. NGOs and CBOs will implement the literacy programs. The responsibilities of all parties
and the modus operandi of the program are to be detailed in an operation manual which exists in draft
form prepared by the UNDP.
During Phase 1, the following activities will be developed :(a) finalization of the operation
manual, including monitoring indicators and reporting requirements and formats, agreed upon by
participating NGOs and CBOs, (b) provision of programs for about 4,000 adults a year starting in
1999/2000 by NGOs and CBOs, (c) annual process evaluations for the first two years of operation, (d)
evaluation of literacy outcomes every 18 months (to correspond to the length of the programs), (e)
annual workshops with providers to discuss the results of the evaluations, (f) capacity building for
providers in training of facilitators and program management, and (g) capacity building of ANFED in
program monitoring and evaluation through support from extemal consultants. As information on
UNDP financing is not yet available, IDA financing has not yet been allocated for this activity.
Phase 2 expansion of literacy programs beyond the UNDP intervention depending on the
results, continued capacity building in evaluation, and start up of longitudinal studies.

Component 9. Program to Improve Sector Management
The overall objectives include, to improve: (a) the efficiency and effectiveness of sector
management, (b) the performance of all staff in the sector, (c) budget preparation and expenditure
monitoring, (d) teacher recruitment and posting, and (e) information for decision making, and for
monitoring and evaluating the quality of the services provided by the sector.
An institutional analysis was conducted. The process aided in clarifying the roles and
responsibilities of all actors in the chain of service delivery from the school to top management, whether
each program has an appropriate institutional home and staffing, each unit's responsibility in the
implementation of the sector program, and their capacity building needs. This analysis helped to
identify medium and long-term capacity building needs which are included in the different program
components.
Recently, Government restructured the DoSE to give greater decision making and management
responsibilities to line managers, and to provide institutional homes for emerging areas which do not fit
into the current structure such as secondary and higher education, human resource development, and
information technology to manage the technology needs and equipment of the Department. Directors
have been appointed to all Directorates and are in place, with the exception of the PPARBD Director
who returns from training in September 1998.
Objectives are: (a) strengthen the PPARBD in: (i) its information function including gathering,
analysis and publishing of annual statistics and monitoring indicators for the program, (ii) its planning
function, including school location identification and mapping, (iii) its role in budgeting and
expenditure control, including setting up a comprehensive education management information system,
and (iv) its role in consolidating and managing the evaluation and research studies of the DoSE; (b)
improve coordination of work across all units and across donors, (c) improve the leadership and
management at the central, regional and school levels, and (d) strengthen the capacity of the ITHRD to:
(i) develop and implement a HR development policy and program training accordingly, (e) evaluate
teacher conditions of service, (f) institute a staff performance appraisal system, and (g) connect all
management offices to Email and Internet to facilitate communication and access to information.
Phase 1 includes: (a) developing a comprehensive Management Information System including
expenditure data, a personnel module linked to the PMO, and a teacher record system, (b) establishing a
school map, construction norms, and criteria for site selection for secondary schools, (c) strengthening
the capacity of the regional offices to take responsibility for school mapping, (d) production of annual
monitoring indicators, (e) expansion of office facilities, (f) leadership and management training for all
managers, (g) making functional and effective the proposed coordination mechanisms (see Section 4 of
the PAD), (h) connecting all managers and regional offices to Email, (i) developing and implementing a
training policy for staff, (j) training several staff abroad in critical areas for which insufficient expertise
exists (namely, curriculum development, testing and measurement, and planning and evaluation), and
(k) developing a staff performance appraisal system.
Phase 2 will continue phase I activities focusing on staff training on the MIS and
production of new reports, institutionalizing performance appraisal, continued management and
leadership training, continued training abroad for other key areas (special needs education and
early childhood development), and work on decentralizing additional functions to the regional
level as will be identified through Government's on going work on decentralization.

Annex 4: Economic and Fiscal Analysis Summary
1. Rationale for Public Intervention
Market shares. Table 4.1 shows distribution of enrolment across providers--
Government, grant-aided, private and madrassa. Grant aided schools are mission schools that
receive a grant from the Government to cover staff salaries and are supervised/ regulated in the
same way as public schools. Private schools receive no subsidy and are fully financed through
fees and other contributions. The Madrassas (Islamic/Arabic primary school) have Arabic as the
medium of instruction. Many children attend them prior to enrolling in the formal system; others
attend the two concurrently; and others attend the madrassa exclusively. Main characteristics of
the market are shown in Table 4.1.

students, and a higher share in grades 1-6 (78%). The madrassas enrol about 11% of students in
grades 1-6. Grant-aided schools enroll about 10% of basic students. Private fee paying schools
are only a small share of gr 1-6 enrolment but account for nearly one-third of enrolment in
grades 7-9. All grant aided and private schools are in urban areas where there is a larger student
market and higher income.
*  Secondary education (grades 10-12) is almost exclusively provided by grant aided and
private schools, with public schools enrolling only 12% of students.
* Higher education is exclusively provided by Government through three public institutions.
*  Skills, vocational and technical education is available to students exiting at grade 6 and 9.
There are some 25-30 private skill centers and institutions, mainly serving the commercial
sector, with an enrolment capacity of about 1,000 students. The share of public and private
provision is about 50-50. Both are concentrated in the Banjul area.

Total cost includes all direct costs including those that parents pay such as uniforms,
supplies, transport and school lunch.
Financing. Government is the main financier of education (Table 4.2). It finances about
65% of the total cost of basic education for public school students, with parents and charities (in
the case of grant aided schools) financing the remainder. Government finances a smaller share of
basic education costs compared with other levels of education which are more costly, have a
comparatively lower level of cost recovery, and a higher private and lower social rate of return
(Table 4.3).

NOTE: Results are sensitive to the assumptions about how to value foregone earnings for basic education. Here they are
assumed to be close to zero. Wage differentials between levels of education are high. For higher education, there were too few
cases to attempt to calculate a rate of retum.
Impact of Education Sector Program. A main objective of the sector program is to
increase enrolment in basic education from 175,000 in 1996/97 to about 305,000 by 2003/04 and
to 350,000 by 2005/6 to reach 90% of the school-aged population. The strategy envisaged to
achieve that combines supply and demand side interventions focused particularly on girls and
rural areas.
On the supply side, the strategy includes:
*  Increased classrooms in government schools by 400/year in the basic cycle, focusing on rural
areas and reducing students in overcrowded urban schools,
*  Support madrassas to integrate English and Math in the curriculum;
*  Increased use of double shift and multi grade teaching; and
*  For capital investments, maintain NGO input through a matching grant formula.
The projected market shares of the different providers as a result of the program are
shown below. The main assumptions underlying the target enrolment by provider are based on
trends over the past 5 years. No changes are planned in policies regulating service provision. The
main assumptions are:
*  Each place created will generate I new enrolled child.
*  Growth in the private sector remains at the same rate as it has over the past 5 years,
madrassas included.
*  Any expansion of grant aided and private schools will continue to take place in urban areas

where parents can afford it.
*  At the secondary level, in accordance with current practice, new schools will be established
as public schools and then converted to grant aided schools after a few years of operation and
once the management board is appointed.
Table 4.4 shows the resulting distribution of enrolment by provider. Note also that the
program is front loaded which is necessary to attain the desired enrolment in gr 7-9 during the
period. In grades 1-6, public school enrolment is projected to increase as a percentage of the total
from 78 to 84% while the shares of all other types declines slightly. The share of public
enrolment in grades 7-9 increases more rapidly from 66% to 82% by 2005 as these grades
become a part of nine-years of basic education, less selective and more available in rural areas.
At the secondary level, new schools will be converted to grant aided so that the public school
share will decline as public schools are converted.

Increased Government provision should result in a net increase in supply. Based on past
experience, and given the low income levels and the limited HR capacity in The Gambia, the
probability that the increase in public schools will crowd out private schools is probably low.
Grant aided (missionary) and private schools have not expanded to rural areas after decades of
operation due to the limited income base in rural areas. Although in grades 7-9, government
provision increases from 66% to 82%, this is more a reflection current limited access of rural
students to these levels of education and the lack of a market for private schools than it is
crowding out.
Demand. The target enrolment assumes that the number of places created will result in a
corresponding increase in enrolment. One way in which this could happen is if we assume a
national market where demand is perfectly elastic. But, this is not the actually case in The
Gambia. Figure I more accurately depicts the national market.

Available information suggests that demand is sensitive to price. Of the 40,000 children
not currently attending any primary school, an estimated 75% are girls, 70% are in households
which earn less than the median income, and nearly all live in the rural areas. Income is a strong
predictor of education, and parents overwhelmingly cite the direct cost of education as the main
'.arrier to attendance, particularly for girls. Other explanatory variables include the distance to
grades 7-9. Beyond grade 6 marriage and pregnancy become important deterrents for girls.
To address these, costs will be lowered in the basic cycle, school feeding will better
target the poor, and a package of interventions will be introduced to increase girl's enrolment and
retention such as scholarships for girls at the upper basic and secondary levels.
Given the assumed national market, the expansion of supply coupled with demand side
interventions should result in a net increase in supply and a near corresponding increase in
enrolment. So even if demand is not perfectly elastic, an increase supply coupled with a drop in
price is expected to come close.
2. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis and Financial Analysis
The broad objectives of education for the remainder of the policy period up to the year
2003 are to:
A increasheinf gross enrollment ratio in basic education to about 90% of 7-15 year olds
(including madrassa enrollment),
p   increase access to secondary to cater for at least half of the graduates of the Basic cycle
and  provide learting opportunities for general and special subjects such as Technology,
Science and Commerce6
T improve lea eing outcomes at all levels through
Gimproved curricula, focusing on literacy and numeracy, science and technology, and
the arts and humanities,

Country: Gambia                                                        Annex 4 - Page 5 of 26
* improved facilities and learning environments,
* appropriate training of teachers,
* increased availability of learning materials, and
* improved monitoring, assessment and evaluation strategies;
*  increase access to and improve the co-ordination of vocational and technical education
programs;
*  increase access for adults to functional literacy and numeracy programs; and
*  in the longer term, increase opportunities for higher education to meet the required
human resource needs.
To achieve these objectives, the following four key strategies are envisaged:
*  Restructuring the existing 6-3-3-4 system of education to a 9-3-4 system, reflecting nine
years of Basic Education, three years of Senior Secondary Education, and 2 to 4 years of
post-secondary education;
*  Capacity building for the professional development of all education personnel;
*  Improving the management of the education sector, and
*  Maximizing resources for education by improving the use of existing resources, that is
expanding double-shift and multigrade teaching, increasing student:teacher ratios and ensuring
that learning materials are used and maintained.
Financing policies outlined in the policy framework include:
* maintaining the share of the Government budget allocated to education
*  increased cost recovery at those levels of education where the social benefit is lowest, and
particularly in higher education, and
-  lowering the cost of education, particularly for girls and the poor.
Based on this framework, the DoSE developed a Master Plan (MP) which sets more
specific objectives, and describes the strategies and programs that will be implemented to achieve
the policy priorities. For example, the MP sets the following targets:
*  Increase double-shifting in grades 1-6, from 10% of all classes to 28% by 2003 and to 32%
by 2005,
*  Increase double-shifting in grades 7-9, from 30% of all classes to 40% by 2003 and to 50%
by 2005,
*  increase double-shifting in Secondary schools from 10% to 40% of all classes by 2003 (70%
of teachers) and to 40% by 2005,
* Increase student:teacher ratios from 30:1 in basic education to 45:1 by 2003
*  Achieve a minimum class size of 35 and a maximum of 45 by 2003
*  Deliver 880 hours of instruction in all schools in basic education
*  Maintain a 50% transition rate from basic education to secondary education corresponding to
an increase in the gross enrollment ratio at the secondary level from 16% in 1996/97 to 28%
by the end of the policy period.

The MP also proposes financial measures to improve the cost-effective use of resources
and increase the enrollment of girls and the poor. These include:
*  Eliminating the book rental fee in lower basic education (grades 1-6)
*  Phasing out the grade 6 exam and therefore the exam fee
*  Reducing tuition charges for upper basic education from 150 to 100 dalasi per term
*  Reducing tuition charges in secondary education from 250 per term to 200 dalasi per term
*  Eliminating tuition charges for girls in upper basic and secondary education in regions 3-6
*  Providing scholarships for needy girls in regions 3-6, and to an estimated 10% of girls'in
regions 1-2 in upper basic and secondary education to cover the cost of uniforms, books and
supplies
Recurrent Cost Implications
The policies and programs proposed for the next eight-year period propose measures that
will at the same time:
*  Generate savings by lowering the unit cost of education,
*  Increase public expenditure on education due to system growth and higher expenditure on
quality enhancing inputs such as textbooks and an increased percentage of qualified teachers,
and
*  Lower the cost of education to parents through reduced fees and other charges.
How do the cost saving and the increased costs balance out? Are the policy framework
and associated MP affordable given the projected growth in GDP and Govemment recurrent
budget? To address these questions, the DoSE developed a model to estimate the recurrent cost
impact of the proposed program and policy measures on Government expenditure as well as on
the cost to parents. If it is assumed that education's share is to be maintained at its current level of
about 26% of Government recurrent expenditure (excluding interest payments) and the IMF
assumptions regarding GDP growth and Government expenditure hold true, the program will
generate recurrent costs in excess of 26% of the Government recurrent budget (excluding interest
payments). Although significant savings will be generated by increasing student:teacher ratios,
recurrent costs will still exceed the Government's capacity to finance them, particularly in the
medium term unless measures are taken immediately to achieve a reduction in the number of
teachers employed.
Enrollment Growth Targets
Table 4.5 shows the gross enrollment and internal efficiency targets. Table 4.6 shows the
resulting enrollment, and intake and transition rates required to achieve the targets (see Annex I
for complete results). The results assume that madrassa, private and grant aided enrollment will
continue to grow at the rate of previous years. They suggest that in order to achieve the gross
enrollment target in basic education of about 75% in 2001/02 and 90% by 2005/06, with the
proposed repetition and drop-out targets, will require:
* An average annual enrollment growth rate in lower basic of about 6.8% a year, and 8% a year
in Government schools,
* An average annual enrollment growth rate in upper basic of 12.4% a year, and 16.8% in
Government schools,

*   An annual average enrollment growth rate of 9.7% in secondary education, and 27% a year, in
Government schools (40% a year during the first half of the period, and 12.3% annually
during the second half ),
*   An intake rate of the seven year old population rising from an estimated 78%  in 1996/97 to
90% by 2001/02 and to 100% by 2005/06,
*   An increase in the transition rate from grade 6 to 7 from 75%  in 1996/97 to 78%  in 2000/01
and to 87% in 2005/06, and
*   A transition rate from grade 9 to 10 declining from an estimated 67% of grade 9 graduates to
62% by 2001/02 and to 54% by 2005/06. The declining transition rate is due to the increased
number of students who will be graduating from grade 9. Although the transition rate
declines, the gross enrollment ratio increases by 10 percentage points.
These projections form the basis of the remainder of the simulations.

Fiscal Analysis Scenarios
Based on the above enrollment objectives, seven scenarios are presented to show the
impact of the targets and proposed policy decisions on the cost effectiveness and affordability of
the program in terms of Government and private financing of recurrent costs.
Scenario I estimates the resulting enrollment and estimated recurrent costs of a
continuation of existing intake rates, unit costs, repetition and dropout rates, resource use in terms
of classes double-shifting, teachers per class and class size, and financial policies.
Scenario 2 estimates the impact of the enrollment growth targets above, holding all other
parameters constant.
Scenario 3 estimates the impact of the enrollment growth targets, the proposed efficiency
measures to lower repetition and dropout, increase double-shift and multigrade teaching, increase
student teacher ratios to 45: 1, and lower the percentage of unqualified teachers to 20% by the end
of the program period according to the schedule proposed in the Master Plan. Increasing the
student:teacher ratio requires, in addition to double-shift and multigrade teaching, assumptions
about class size and the number of teachers per class. The assumptions used in this scenario are
in Table 4.7.

Scenario 4 is the same as scenario 3 but makes adjustments for immediate reductions in
the number of teachers per class as opposed to spreading it out over 8 years. This was done
because scenario 3, with the continued high number of teachers per class, resulted in an
immediate unaffordable cost. Therefore, scenario 4 was retained for the remainder of the
analysis.
Scenario 5 builds on scenario 4 while increasing Government expenditure on books and
scholarships for girls.
Scenario 6 adds in saving measures to rationalize grant-in aid and improve the targeting
of the school lunch expenditure.
Scenario 7 adds two other cost saving measures -- freezing expenditure on exams and the
school bus service.
Cost Savings Analysis
The cost effectiveness indicators selected correspond to the main benefits expected from
the program. They include:
(a)       An increase in enrollment in basic education by 168,500 additional students -- by about
121,700 students in grades 1-6 and 46, 800 in grades 7-9;
(b)        Lower cost per student per year in basic education by expanding double shift and
multigrade teaching;

(c)           Lower repetition and dropout which increases the cohort survival rate and lowers the cost
per graduate.
In addition to the assumption of achieving the desired repetition and dropout rates, the
results also assume that there is a one to one correspondence between the number of places
created and enrollment, that is that every additional place created will be occupied by a student.
Table 4.8 shows the results with and without the program. All other things being equal,
the program will generate significant improvements in the cost-effectiveness of public
expenditure.

Savings in the cost per graduate. Comparing scenario I and scenario 2, that is a
continuation of the same intake rates at the different levels of education and no reduction in
dropout and repetition, compared with the program targets for these indicators, shows the cost
savings of the required investment to produce one graduate.
Overall, given that the internal efficiency of the system is already high (relative to other
countries), repetition and dropout rates have a modest impact on the cohort survival rates. For
the lower cycle of basic education, by the end of the program, an estimated 82% of students
entering grade I would complete grade 6 compared with 76% without the program. For upper
basic, 98% of students entering grade 7 would complete grade 9 compared with about the same
percentage in the absence of the program. The same holds for secondary education. However,
the savings in terms of the number of investment years required to produce one graduate from

lower basic education is important.
The cost per graduate as a result of the program is about 7% lower than what it would be in the
absence of the program.
Cost savings per student. Comparing Scenario 3 with Scenario 2 shows that if the targets
set for double-shift and multigrade teaching and the number of teachers per class and class size
are achieved, the program is estimated to result in lower public per student costs as follows:
* 20% lower in grades 1-6 (declining from 580 to 450 dalasi per student),
* 48% lower in grades 7-9 (declining from 1,550 to 800 dalasi per student), and
* 9% lower in grades 10-12 (declining from 1,300 to 1,200 dalasi per student).
This will result in a total savings of almost 400 million over the 8 year period (average of
40 - 50 million/year), or a 19% reduction in total government recurrent expenditure over the 8
years relative to what it would be without the proposed efficiency targets.
The large reductions for grades 1-6 and 7-9 indicate a over-recruitment of personnel
which, as shown in the previous section, is a perennial problem and limits the resources available
for expansion and quality inputs. As will be shown, unless immediate measures are taken to
control teacher recruitment and rationalize their use, expansion will not be possible even in the
medium-term.
There are no standard or achievement measures available to gauge quality in the system.
Studies (J. Farrel 1993) have shown that variables such as textbooks, teaching aids and learning
materials, library, frequency of homework's, duration of school program, social status of
teachers, expenditure per pupil are important ingredients of quality. Government spends least on
these variables; only 4.6% of the recurrent expenditure on education is spent on books and other
learning materials. The program provides textbooks free to students in grades 1-6, increase the
number and mode of training of teachers (providing them with more practical experience) and
increases on expenditure on teaching aids and learning materials as a means of improving quality.
Meanwhile, standardized measures of quality and achievements tests would be developed and
implemented.
3.    Impact of the Program on Government Recurrent Expenditure
The analysis of the impact of the program on the public recurrent budget assumes
following macro situation:
* A GDP real growth rate of 4.0% in 1998/99 and 5% annually thereafter,
* A GDP deflator of 3.2% in 1998/99 and 2.7% thereafter
*  Total Government expenditure as a share of GDP falling from 26.5% in 1997/98 to 21.9% in
200/01 and thereafter
*  Current expenditure as a share of GDP falling from 19.1% in 1997/98 to 15.8% in 2000/01 an
thereafter, and
*  Current expenditure minus interest falling from 14.4% in 1997/98 to 12.1% in 1999/2000
and thereafter
It is important to note that a number of costs are not contained in the analysis due to the
need for clarification from the Government. These concern:

Country: Gambia                                                      Annex 4 - Page 12 of 26
*  Higher Education. It is assumed that student enrollment in the university level programs will
not exceed 400 over the entire period. The unit cost will remain at 20,000 dalasi per student
per year and that the total scholarship envelope will be equivalent to half the total cost, or 4.0
million dalasi. Recently, a university complex estimated at US$ 5.5 million with an expected
student enrollment of 1,200 by the year 2003 was included in the MP.
*  The elimination of fees for girls in regions 2-6 in lower basic and upper secondary will
require that Government pay the fee to the school. Therefore, for the moment, girls are still
included as fee paying in the model.
*  Additional teachers for national languages. The MP contains a proposal to teach national
languages as a subject from Grade 3 onward. Estimates of the impact on teacher recruitment
have yet to be made.
*  Vocational and Technical Education. The estimates do not take into account any increase in
expenditure on Vocational or Technical education as the DoSE has no financing policy
related to these areas. Thus it is assumed that if there is expansion, it will take place on the
basis of full cost recovery.
*  In-service teacher training. The model does not include additional operating costs related to
in-service teacher training which, under the MP, is to increase significantly.
If any of these assumptions do not hold, the targets for basic and secondary education
will need to be adjusted downward. Cabinet has, however, approved the principle of cost
recovery in teacher training programs at the Gambia College. The level of recovery remains to
be fixed and the estimated savings on the Government budget are yet to be estimated. This will
unlikely have a significant impact on total expenditure as the Gambia College is a small
percentage of total expenditure and, although enrollment will more than double. One option
would be to introduce cost recovery at this level and use the funds for financing the in-service
component.
Due to the fact that certain policy decisions have not yet been taken, that several of those
taken have yet to be defined and implemented,, and that the academic year spans two budget
years, it will be essential that two year budget plans are prepared every year taking into account
estimated enrollment, unit costs, and cost recovery, and that expenditures be carefully monitored.
Figures 1 and 2 below summarize the results of the seven scenarios. Scenario 7 is clearly
the most affordable, particularly in the medium term. As a share of total recurrent expenditure,
education's share is maintained at about 19% through 1998/99 and then begins to increase to
21.3% by 2001/02 and to 21.8% by 2005/06. Excluding debt service, education's share is
maintained at about 26% through 1998/99, increases to about 27.7% in 2001/02 and to 28.4% by
2005/06. If, however, education's share must remain at around 26%, other measures will be
necessary to either contain expenditure further or for donor's to finance part of the recurrent
costs. These options are examined further below.

Scenario 1. Recall that Scenario I assumes that no intervention takes place and that the
intake rates at the different levels of education remain constant. Under these assumptions, the
recurrent budget requirement in the year 2005/06 will almost double in real terms from its present
level of D 140 million. Education's share of total Government recurrent budget would increase
from 19.4% in 1996/97 to 25.9% in 2001/02 and then decline to 23.9% as Government
expenditure is projected to grow faster than enrollment during the latter period. As a share of
Government recurrent expenditure excluding interest payments, education's share rises steadily
from 25.7% in 1996/97 to 33.7% by 2001/02, and from 3.5% to 4.4% of GDP. This option is
inconsistent with reasonable possibilities.
Scenario 2. When the enrollment growth targets are introduced without any reduction in
per student costs, the impact on recurrent expenditures far exceeds the realm of feasibility. Under
these circumstances, education's share of Government recurrent expenditure (excluding debt
service) is projected to reach 36% by 2001/02 (4.8% of GDP) and to continue at that level.
Scenario 3. The introduction of gradual increases in student: teacher ratios and a gradual
reduction of the percentage of unqualified teachers yields total savings estimated at about 380
million dalasi between 1998/99 and 2005/06. However, education's share of Government
recurrent expenditure (excluding interest payments) increases steadily to 30.7% by 2001/02 and
falls slightly to 30.1 % by 2005/06 when the efficiency measures have their greatest impact.
Although the cost savings are important, compared to not introducing the efficiency measures,
this scenario is also of questionable sustainability, particularly in the medium term.

a/ Savings is the total amount saved between 1998/99 and the year indicated for scenario 3 compared with Scenario 2.
Scenario 4 tests the impact on the medium term affordability of advancing the measures
to lower the number of teachers per class in basic education. This would mean an immediate lay
off of a significant number of unqualified/contractual teachers (about 550 in grade 1-6 and 280 in
grades 7-9). This scenario also assumes that additional needs for teachers due to enrollment
growth will be met with qualified teachers. The latter assumption has no impact in the medium
term compared to scenario 3 but has a larger cost impact in the longer term. This is because the
fixing of a gradual reduction to 20% of unqualified teachers does not take into account the
projected output of the Gambia College which will lead to a larger reduction of unqualified
teachers. When this output is taken into account, by 2005 the percentage of unqualified teachers
is reduced to around 8-10% as opposed to 20%. Therefore, either the intake into teacher training
needs to be adjusted downward so that the 20% unqualified teachers is maintained or the
percentage of unqualified teachers needs to be adjusted downward to reflect the projected plans
for the training of qualified teachers.

Compared to phasing in the reduction of excess teachers, the impact of an immediate
reduction yields savings of about 160 million dalasi for the period 1998/99-2001/02. Annual
savings average 40 million a year up to 2001/02 after which time the cost savings are mainly due
to multigrade and double shift teaching. Education's share of Government recurrent expenditure
is also more manageable in the medium term, remaining at about 26% through 1998/99 and then
increasing to 28.8% by 2001/02 and to 29.2% by 2005/06. Although still high relative to the
resources available, immediate action to reduce excess personnel is a necessary condition for the
affordability of the program.

a/ Savings is the total amount saved between 1998/99 and the year indicated. The savings for scenario 4 are those as compared to Scenario 2. Those for
scenario 5 are from a comparison with scenario 4, and those for scenario 6 are relative to scenario 5. A negative sign indicates increased costs.
Scenario 5. Compared to scenario 4, implementing the proposals for Government to shift
its expenditure from supplies to books, to provide a set of books to all students in grades 1-6 on a
loan basis free of charge, and to provide scholarships to 10% of girls in upper basic and
secondary education will increase education's share of Government recurrent expenditure by 1.3
percentage points in the medium term and by 1.1 percentage points by 2005/06, so that
education's share of recurrent expenditure (excluding debt service) increases to 30.8% and 31.6%
2001/02 and 2005/06, respectively. In the medium term, the increase is due mainly to books; in
the longer term half the increase is due to the scholarship program.
If it is assumed that 10% of girls in upper basic and secondary education will receive
scholarships, and the value of the scholarship is about 1,100 dalasi (which covers the total
estimated cost including fees, books, uniforms, transport, school lunch and supplies), the
financial impact is important, particularly in upper basic education and towards the end of the
policy period. The number of girls involved doubles from 1,500 in 1998/99 to 3,000 by 2005/06.
The total cost for upper basic scholarships reaches about 2.1 million dalasi by 2001/02 and 3.6
million dalasi by 2005/06. Note also that these estimates do not include administrative costs.
At the secondary level, the number of girls involved increases from about 170 to 600
over the period at a cost of about 0.6 million and 1.6 million dalasi in 2001/02 2005/06,
respectively.
This simple calculation also illustrates the potential impact of eliminating fees for all girls
in upper basic in regions 3-6 with Government compensating the school for the fee. Eliminating
fees nearly doubles the expenditure required. A rough estimate of the fees that Government
would have to pay for upper basic totals about 1.8 million and 3.0 million dalasi a year by
2001/02 and 2005/06, respectively. For secondary, the charge would be about 0.2 million
annually by 2001/02 increasing to 1.0 million annually by 2005/06.

If fees are deducted from the scholarship, the total cost of the scholarship program would
be 1.5 a year by 2001/02 and 2.6 million a year by 2005/06 for upper basic and, for secondary
education 0.6 and 1.9 million a year by 2001/02 and 2005/06, respectively. Combining the
eliminating of fees with a scholarship program would bring total program costs to 3.3 million and
5.6 million a year for upper basic by 2001/02 and 2005/06, respectively, and to 0.6 million and
1.9 million a year by 2001/02 and 2005/06 for secondary. The annual total cost of the program
would reach 3.9 million by 2001/02 and 7.5 million by 2005/06.
To lower this cost, two options are possible:
*  Reallocate a certain proportion of the funds already allocated to secondary scholarships to
girls and not to consider the scholarship program at this level an additional cost.
*   Start with only one of the measures, the easiest to implement and monitor the need for
additional support.

Scenario 6. As indicated in the previous chapter, on a per student basis, Government
grants to grant-aided schools exceed per student expenditure on salaries in Government schools.
Scenario 6 lowers the per student grant allocated to grant-aided schools to correspond to per
student expenditure on salaries in Government schools. The school feeding program also incurs
considerable expenditure. In the absence of an estimate by the DoSE of the impact of the MP
plan to target these expenditures towards low income regions, in this scenario, the envelope is
frozen in real terms at its present expenditure level of 2.0 million dalasi a year. Compared with
scenario 5, these measures combined have the effect of lowering education's share of recurrent
expenditure (excluding debt service) by about 2 percentage points -- to 28.7% by 2001/02 and to
29.7% by 2005/06. Total savings are estimated at 40 million between 1998/99 - 2001/02 and 60
million between 2002/03 - 2005/06, or about 10 million and 15 million dalasi a year.
Scenario 7 freezes expenditure in real terms at the current allocation on two other high
cost items -- examinations and school bus service. This saves an additional estimated 16 million
dalasi between 1998/99 and 2001/02 and 40 million for the period 2002/03-2005/06 which
reduces the share of education expenditure to 27.7% and 28.4% of total Government recurrent
expenditure by 2001/02 and 2005/06, respectively.

al Savings is the total amount saved between t998S99 and the year indicated. The savings for scenario 7 are those as compared to Scenario 6.
Table 4.13 shows the resulting allocations by level of education. The share of recurrent
expenditure on basic education (grades 1-9) falls from 69% in 1997/98 to 67% by 2001/02 and
then increases to 71 % by 2005/06. The decline during the late 1990s is due to the efficiency
measures as inefficiency is highest at these levels. The share allocated to the Gambia College
increases from 6.7% to 9.3% by 2001/02 due to the need to train an increased number of
teachers. The share declines afterwards as the number needed to be trained slows. The share
allocated to administration increases because it is based on a per student cost of 65 dalasi which
includes administration salaries, operating and maintenance costs and books and materials for the
national library. Total expenditures in this category increase from about 10 million in 1997/98 to

Recurrent Cost Financing Gap
Table 4.14 shows the estimated recurrent cost financing gap for scenarios 5 through 7
assuming that education's share of Government recurrent expenditure remains at 26%, and
increases to 27% and 28%. Given that the former situation is the most likely in the medium term,
recurrent cost support under scenario 7 would average about 11 million dalasi a year up to
2001/02 and higher thereafter. If education's share were to increase to 27%   after 2001/02 about
the same level of recurrent cost support (i.e. 11 million annually) would be required. However, if
grant in aid is not rationalized and expenditure on school lunches, school bus service and
examinations is not frozen, the recurrent cost financing gap increases considerably. Thus,
scenario 7 seems to be the most reasonable option.

From where can the additional financing come? The most obvious categories for
external financing are:
*    Textbooks which average an estimated 4 million dalasi a year (excluding the initial stock for
grades 7-9 for the full cost recovery rental system), and
*    Scholarships (or fee payment) for girls at an estimated 2 million dalasi/year for upper basic
while Government allocations for secondary school scholarships are shifted to girls.
This leaves an additional 5 million dalasi to be found.
Examining the resulting distribution of education expenditure by input (Table 4.15),
some options for further cost cutting are as follows:
*    Examinations - Even after freezing examinations expenditure, this category still comprises a
large share of the budget, between 6 - 7 million dalasi a year. Serious investigation as to
whether these costs can be cut will be critical for the sustainability of the program.

*   School bus service. Eliminating subsidies to the bus service will save an additional 3 million
dalasi a year
*   Cutting back grant-in-aid is the only other option.
However, with further cuts in the above categories, the additional 5 million can be found.

Private Financing
Scenario 7 also reduces school fees at the upper basic and secondary levels. Table 4.16
shows the resulting average private cost per student per year (excluding school lunch which is
estimated at about 180 dalasi per student per year) in dalasi and as a percentage of income per
capita by quintile. The impact of the fee reduction in upper basic and secondary education is
budget neutral for Government. Fees are collected by, and maintained at the school where they
are intended to be used for maintenance. The actual fee level (if collected from all students) far
exceeds the amount required for maintenance. At current fee levels, if all students paid, the total
collected would be equivalent to about 5.8% and 14.3% of the value of the infrastructure in upper
basic and secondary school, respectively. As a norm, 5% of the value of the stock is generous for
maintenance. If we assume that the 5.8% is maintained in upper basic and that the amount
charged in secondary decreases to 10% of the value of the stock (already double what is needed),
fees can be lowered to about 390 per year (which is in line with the proposal of the MP to reduce
fees at this level to 100 dalasi per term), and to 420 dalasi per year for secondary education (or
140 dalasi per term which is lower than the MP proposal to reduce fees at this level to 200 dalasi
per term).

At this fee level, it should be investigated whether the additional fees should not be used
to finance other costs currently borne by the recurrent budget (e.g. free tuition for girls), or
proposed to be financed by Government (e.g. recurrent costs associated with Internet access
which will not be possible under the budget constraint). In addition, Government allocations from
the investment budget for secondary school maintenance should cease. According to these
estimates, there is no need for additional funds. At present, it is reported that many schools are
investing in Treasury bonds which supports the conclusions that fees collected are in excess of
needs.

Although the cost to parents will decline under the program, for the lowest income
quintiles, upper basic and secondary education still represent a large share of their per capita
income. If families in the lowest two income quintiles had one child each in lower basic, upper
basic and secondary school, expenditures (excluding school lunch) would total between 88% -
110% of per capita income, in other words the total expenditure of one person in the family. This
compares to 50% and to 27% of per capita income for families in the 3rd and 4th and 5th income
quintile, respectively. However, a reduction of fees for the lowest income quintiles would help
considerably reducing the cost burden to between 50-62% of per capita income for the two
lowest income quintiles if a family had three children in school, one at each level.
5.    Poverty Analysis and Targeting
A benefit incidence analysis conducted during preparation and for the public expenditure
review demonstrates that subsidies are not targeted towards the poor. Table 4.17 shows the
distribution of public subsidies by quintile and level of education. At the primary level, the
wealthiest quintile receives double the subsidy per capita compared with the two lowest quintiles.
In grades 7-9, the wealthiest receive more than three times the subsidy per capita of the two
lowest quintiles, and 4 times the subsidy at the secondary level. This is because the poorest have

larger families (double the family size of the richest quintile); they send fewer of their children to
school; and at the higher levels of education where few poor are represented, unit costs are higher
and parents pay a smaller share of the total cost.

The Lorenz curve in Figure 5.1 shows that none of the education subsidies are pro-poor.
At all levels of education, lower income individuals receive a smaller share of the education
subsidy than their share of the overall population. (The 45_ diagonal indicates equal shares of
the total subsidy.) If tertiary education were included, the gap would be even larger. For grades
1-12, the poorest 40% of households account for 55% of the school-aged population but receive
only 37% of government expenditure, while the wealthiest 40% of households have 29% of the
school-aged population but receive 42% of government expenditure. Parents also pay a larger
share of the total cost of grades 1-9 (about 40%) while only 12% for secondary education.

Other studies (1993 Household Education and Health Survey, and several on girl's
education using qualitative and quantitative methods), show that enrolment of the poor, and girls
in particular, is very sensitive to price. The majority of parents of children out of school report
the direct cost of education to be the most important barrier. And, of the 40,000 children out of
school an estimated 75% are girls, 70% are in households which earn less than the median
income, and most live in the rural areas.
Minimum essential family expenditure is estimated at 125 dalasi (excluding school
lunch). Families in the lowest income quintile spend less (100 dalasi); those in the highest
income quintile spend 3 times as much (350 dalasi). Direct costs increase considerably in grades

7-9 and 10-12 where minimum essential family expenditure is estimated at 1,250 dalasi and
2,600 dalasi respectively per student. If families have I child each in grades 1-6, 7-9 and 10-12,
the total cost would represent about 20% of a poor family's income and 8% of family income for
those in the highest income quintile. Other explanatory variables include the distance to an upper
basic education school; beyond primary education marriage, and pregnancy become important
deterrents for girls.
In order to reach enrolment targets for basic education, and assuming that 40% comes
from population growth in the families that send their children to school already, 24% is in the
private sector, about 45% of new enrolment will have to come from this group currently out of
school. For example if only 50% of the poorest out of school children enrolled, new enrolment
would be 22% lower than predicted.

(Annex 5)
7.     Monitoring and Evaluation
The DoSE has developed a set of quantitative targets indicators related to its expansion
and resource use objectives which underlie the estimates of the recurrent cost financing required
for the program. The targets are attached and are also included in the logical framework. They
will be used to monitor the program's progress in achieving the objectives set. Below is a sub-set
of these indicators complimented by key qualitative performance indicators, also drawn from the
log frame, that will be used to assess performance and for the purposes of 590 reporting.
In addition to these performance indicator a set of evaluation studies, both formative and
summative, are included in the program for key activities as well as those of a pilot nature. These
studies include:
An external evaluation of the functioning of the textbook recycling and rental scheme every two
years.
An formative evaluation of the new three year primary teacher training certificate program.
Evaluation of the impact of the School Feeding Program
Evaluation of the functioning and impact of the girls' scholarship scheme
Annual process evaluations of the pilot adult literacy program during the first two years
Annual evaluations of literacy outcomes of the pilot adult literacy program
GTTI tracer studies
Monitoring and coordination mechanisms are summarized in section 4 of the PAD and
are detailed in the Program Implementation Manual and in the Coordination Links document
prepared by the DoSE.

THE GAMBIA
THIRD EDUCATION SECTOR PROGRAM
Annex 5: Institutional Assessment and Capacity Building Analysis
Objective and Methodology
The institutional assessment was undertaken in order to determine if the Government has
core capacity to implement Phase I of the program and, if necessary, to propose measures to
strengthen this capacity. The assessment was aimed also at determining what further capacity
needs to be built during Phase I to strengthen the Government for Phase II, and what can be done
for the improvement of long-term capacity to deliver services, beyond the implementation of this
program.
The methodology used in performing this assessment is based on an operational
definition of capacity. Operational definitions do not focus on the question 'what is it?', but
rather on 'what should be observable if it is there?' The definition of capacity, thus, suggests that
the following factors should be observable in any sector, if it has capacity:
-  All important functions have an organizational home within the sector
-  The sector, and its organizations, have effective leadership
-  The sector, and its organizations, have financial resources with which to procure the inputs
necessary to carry out their functions
X  Adequate human resources are available to be procured
  Work practices followed in the sector's organizations are adequate
Using this operational definition, and starting with the program's development objectives
as formulated in the Logframe, the appraisal team focused first on the questions 'whose capacity
within the sector is in question?' and 'capacity to do what?' The team identified all the
organizations (DoSE, the Gambia College, WAEC and the Department of State for Social
Welfare) and all the units within them, on whose capacity depends the implementation of the
program, and then confirmed the development tasks assigned to them. Bearing in mind the five
factors listed above, the team then focused on each and every unit and asked the following
questions:
*  Is the unit in question the right organizational home for the specific development functions
and tasks assigned to it by the Government?
*  What is the quality of leadership and management in the unit?
*  Does the unit have sufficient funds to cover operating costs associated with the
implementation of activities assigned to it?
*  Does the unit have the right number of people, with the right mix of skills, to implement
these activities? and
*  Are key work practices - techniques, methods and procedures - followed by these people
efficient and effective?
The answers to these questions allowed the team to determine capacity gaps and, together
with the Government, address them. Four types of alternatives were considered in each case
where a capacity gap was identified:
*  to change practices and procedures, where such change can improve the capacity of the unit
without having to allocate to it more resources

* to spread planned activities over a longer period of time (which included the introduction of a
two-phase approach and the postponement of certain activities to Phase Two)
* to re-allocate financial and human resources among the various units so as to match the
magnitude of their assigned work and, finally, if all these alternatives were not feasible,
* to reduce the scope and the magnitude of the specific development objectives
Assessment
As indicated in Section E4 in the main body of this document, the appraisal team has
concluded that the Govemment of The Gambia will be able to start implementing the
development program in the education sector, provided the program builds up gradually. This
means (a) that the Govemment will implement steps to close some capacity gaps even before
effectiveness and (b) that it will implement further capacity building steps during Phase One, so
as to prepare the ground for activities that had to be postponed to Phase Two due to inadequate
capacity. A description of the most important, common, core capacity gaps, and the steps that
were agreed, is presented in Section E4. These gaps - such as limited management skills and
inadequate funds for the implementation of many project components - will not be discussed here
again. Capacity gaps or concems which are not common, but rather relate to specific
organizations and units, are presented in the following tables. These organization-specific and
unit-specific issues are also referred to in other sections of the PAD, where the functions which
they perform, or the issues with which they deal, are discussed.

Examinations are developed later and
independently (and the developers have to

creates a hidden, different curriculum,
which teachers must teach, if their pupils
are to pass the examinations. The
capacity of DoSE to teach the curriculum
selected by it is thus limited.

THE GAMBIA
THIRD EDUCATION SECTOR PROGRAM
Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement methods (Table 6.1)
A Country Procurement Assessment Review was carried out in 1998. In general,
Gambia's procurement laws and regulations do not conflict with IDA Guidelines. No special
exceptions, permits, or licenses need to be specified in the Credit documents for International
Competitive Bidding (ICB). Gambia's procurement practices allow IDA procedures to take
precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations. However, the threshold under which
the procedure of 3 quotations is authorized by national regulation is too low to allow timely
execution of project activities. The Government has facilitated past education project by allowing
the use of the threshold stated in the Credit Agreement when necessary, and will confirm a similar
flexibility for this project during negotiations.
The proposed program will be financed through an IDA Credit, Government,
Communities, the private sector, NGOs, international agencies comprising inter alia EU, IBD,
AfDB and UN Agencies, the Japanese Cooperation and DFID. All Bank-financed procurement of
goods and services under the project will be carried out in accordance with World Bank
Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1, 1995, revised January
and August 1996, and September 1997, and under Selection and Employment of Consultants by
World BankBorrowers, January 1997 and September 1997. Preference for domestically
manufactured goods will apply in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines. The Procurement
Methods applicable to expenditures financed by the IDA credit are summarized in Table A.
International Competitive Bidding (ICB). To the extent practicable, IDA financed
contracts for goods and works will be grouped in bid packages estimated to cost an amount
equivalent to US$ 100,000 or more for each package and procured in accordance with the
Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1, 1995, revised January
and August 1996 and September 1997.
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to IDA will be used for all
IDA-firanced goods and works contracts that cannot be grouped into packages of at least
US$30,000 but not exceeding US$ 100,000. NCB procedures will include: (a) explicit statement
of the evaluation and award criteria in the bidding documents; (b) national advertising with public
bid opening and time allowed for the preparation of bids not less than four weeks from the date of
invitation to bid or the date of availability of bidding documents, whichever is later; (c) award of
contract of the bidder whose bid is substantially responsive to the bidding documents and who has
offered the lowest evaluated cost; and (d) foreign bidders would not be precluded from
participating in NCB. The Government would use the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for
IDA financed NCB.
Other Procedures include : (a) National Shopping procedures in accordance with
provisions of paragraph 3.5 of the Guidelines will be used for works and goods estimated to cost
less than US$ 30,000 equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate of US$ 5.4 million;
(b) International Shopping will be used for the purchase of specialized instructional materials such
as library books and laboratory consumables up to an aggregate of US$ 1.0 million; (c) Consultant

Civil works, goods and services.
Civil works. During the first phase of the program (1998-2002), the civil work program is
mainly composed of: (i) the construction of 1.884 classrooms for basic education (1570 for lower
basic and 314 for upper basic) including the reconstruction of non permanent 600 existing
dilapidated classrooms, according to standard design of 3 classroom block estimated to cost US$
30,000 per unit, including store rooms, teachers' office and adequate latrines; and 5 laboratories
and staff-rooms for selected upper basic schools; (ii) 10 new secondary schools composed of 9
classrooms, laboratories (computer lab, physics and chemistry/biology labs), administrative block
and latrines and 18 computer-laboratories in secondary schools; (iii) additional facilities in Gambia
College for teacher training (basic and secondary) in order to train 400 additional students per year;
(iv) additional classrooms and laboratories in GTTI, (v) a limited extension of the Education
Ministry's building with 20 offices.
The IDA Credit will finance 710 classrooms for basic education and the expansion of
Gambia College. The remaining part of the basic education school building program is expected to
be financed by the continuation, expansion or start-up of NGOs' proper financing, and support of
other donors. The Government reached agreement with key donors on the use of a common set of
implementation procedures, standardized design and unit costs, planning, monitoring and
evaluation procedures.
Classroom constructions for basic education. The program is composed of a large number
of small site-works, widely scattered in the country. The execution of the IDA financed program
will be organized in sub-programs delegated by the PCU to specialized agencies with a track
record in classroom construction in the Gambia. The Government will use the services of:
(a) GAMWORKS as a Contract Management Agency for the school building sub-program in
urban areas, and (b) several experienced NGOs such as FIOH, Action Aid, and CCF for sub-
programs in rural areas where these NGOs currently implement development programs with
community participation, according to procedures described in the Program Operation Manual and
through Framework Agreements, acceptable to IDA, which include agreed standard design and
technical specifications for the buildings, and annual work programs.
Contracts related to the sub-program managed by GAMWORKS and NGOs, costing more
than US$ 30,000 per contract, up to an aggregate of US$ 7.3 million would be procured through
NCB procedures in accordance with procedures described in the Program Operation Manual
(POM) and acceptable to IDA. Contracts Framework Agreements with NGOs related to sub-
programs in rural areas for works including co-financing from communities (in labor) and the
NGOs will be based on a unit cost per classroom based on the PCU's and NGO's experience, a
pre-determined fixed ceiling of the Government's share of the classroom cost, and appropriate
monitoring mechanisms by the PCU. Contractsfor small works estimated to cost less than US$
30,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$ 2.3 million would be procured under lump-
sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of written quotations obtained from three qualified
domestic contractors. The invitation shall include a detailed description of the works, including
basic specifications, the required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to IDA,
and relevant drawings where applicable. The award would be made to the contractor who offers
the lowest price quotation for the required work, provided he demonstrates he has the experience
and resources to complete the contract successfully.

Other works. All other works will be managed by GAMWORKS. Contracts for works will
not be of a sufficient size to attract foreign contractors through ICB. Contracts which can be
grouped into packages costing US$ 30,000 and more, up to an aggregate of US 0.6 million will be
procured through NCB procedures according to procedures described in the POM and acceptable
to IDA.
Goods. Most contracts for goods financed by IDA related to the procurement of
textbooks, office equipment, computers and vehicles would be procured through ICB. Contracts for
the procurement of furniture for schools and offices, locally available, and costing more than US$
30,000 but less than US$ 100,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$ 1.4 million
would be procured through NCB procedures acceptable to IDA. Procurement for specialized
instructional material such as library books for Gambia College and library corners in all basic
classrooms, consumables for Gambia College laboratories would be procured through
International Shopping, up to an aggregate amount of US $1.0 million. Procurement of small
equipment andfurniture, printed materials and other instructional materials, furniture and vehicles,
costing less than US$ 30,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of US$ 0.6 million will be
procured through prudent national shopping on the basis of quotations obtained from at least three
reputable suppliers. Spare parts, operating expenditures, minor off-the-shelf items, and other
proprietary items costing less than US$ 5,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate of US$
50,000 equivalent, may be procured directly from manufacturers and authorized local distributors.
Direct contracting through an existing contract (between the DoSE and the publisher and initially
financed under IDA Credit 2142-GM) may be used for reprinting of textbooks covered by existing
reprinting rights, provided that the current contract complies with the original bidding documents,
and that the increase in the unit prices do not exceed the inflation rate in the supplier's country
estimated to cost US$1.0 million.
Consultant Services. Consultant Services supported by the IDA credit would be for
studies and technical support related to: (a) the reform of basic and secondary education including:
(i) the revision of teacher training for basic and secondary education including, teacher practicum,
multigrade teaching, distance education, new educational technology; (ii) the development of
curriculum and the revision of teaching and learning materials, including evaluation of national
languages, and the revision of institutional arrangements for in-service training and curriculum
development; (iii) the development and installation of student records and tracking system; (iv) the
management and evaluation of the textbook rental system in upper basic; (b) the preparation of a
University nucleus including the development of (i) curricula, syllabuses, assessment methods,
(ii) administration and management arrangements, and (iii) cost analysis; (c) capacity building for
sector management including: (i) the development of a maintenance policy, (ii) studies to support
the activities of the Directorate in charge of policy, planning and research; (iii) reinforcement of

Project Appraisal Document                            Project Title: Third Education Sector Program
Country: Gambia                                                           Annex 6 - Page 6 of 9
Consultants financed under IDA Credit will be hired through competition based on
Quality-and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) among qualified short-listed firms, by evaluating the
quality of the proposal before comparing the cost of the services to be provided. The Least-Cost
Selection (LCS) will be used for audits -- the firm with the lowest price will be selected, provided
its technical proposal received the minimum mark. Services for small studies will be procured
from Individual Consultants (IC) selected through comparison of qualifications of those expressing
interest. Single Source Selection (SSS) will be used for the management of civil work contracts in
Greater Banjul Area and other urban areas, and for community-based construction programs in
rural areas. The Government of The Gambia proposes to select: (a) the Gambian Agency for the
Management of Civil Works (GAMWORKS) as a construction management agency through a
contract estimated at under US$ 0.4 million -- this AGETIP-type agency created under the IDA
financed "Public Works and Capacity Building Project" is closely supervised by Bank staff and
auditors and has successfully proven its capacity to manage civil-works contracts in urban areas
since 1995; (b) local NGOs which have nation-wide-experience of school construction in rural
areas, namely: (i) FIOH in WD, NBD, LRD, CRD and URD; (ii) Action Aid in URD, CRD and
LRD, and CCF in WD. Contracts will be formed of Framework Agreements completed by Annual
Work-Plans and Budgets to be signed after assessment of performances against pre-determined
indicators spelt out in the respective contracts, for an aggregate amount estimated at about US$
0.22 million per NGO. Methods for Consultants' selection are summarized in Table Al.
Short-lists for contracts estimated under US$ 100,000 may be comprised of national
consultants provided that a sufficient number of qualified firms (at least three) are available at
competitive costs. However, if foreign firms have expressed interest, they will not be excluded
from consideration. The standard Request for Proposal, Letter of Invitation and Forms of Contract
as developed by the Bank Standard requestfor Proposals - Selection of Consultants - July 1997,
Revised April 1998. will be used for appointment of consultants. Simplified contracts will be used
for short-term assignments, i.e. those not exceeding six months, carried out by individual
consultants. The Gox ernment will be briefed during negotiations about the special features of the
new guidelines, in particular with regards to advertisement and public bid opening.
IDA Reviews. IDA-financed contracts for goods and works above the threshold value of
US$ 100,000 equivalent will be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. Contracts awarded
below this threshold will be subject to post-review during IDA's supervision missions. Prior IDA
review will not apply to contracts for the recruitment of consulting firms and individuals estimated
to cost less than US$ 100,000 and US$ 50,000 equivalent, respectively. However, the exception to
prior review will not apply to the Terms of Reference of such contracts, regardless of value, to
single-source hiring, to assignments of a critical nature as determined by IDA, or to amendments of
contracts rising the contract value above the prior review threshold. For consultants contract
estimated above US$ 100,000, opening the financial envelopes will not take place prior to
receiving the Bank's no-objection to the technical evaluation. Documents related to procurement
below the prior review thresholds will be maintained by the borrower for ex-post review by
auditors and IDA supervision missions. All single source contracts will be subject to IDA's prior
review regardless their amount.

Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds. The first phase of the program supported by the present IDA
Credit is expected to be completed over a four-year period. The IDA Credit will be disbursed
according to the categories shown in Table C, and credit closing date would be six months after the
fourth year to allow payment of last invoices for contracts completed before the completion time.
Government's counterpart funds needed for each fiscal year to cover the share of investments and
recurrent costs not financed by IDA will be deposited by the Government in a Project Account . the
Central Bank managed by the PCU Manager on a quarterly basis.
Use of statements of expenses (SOEs). The Borrower may make withdrawals from the
Credit Account on the basis of statements of expenditure for expenditures for goods and works
under contracts costing less than $100,000 equivalent each, for services for consulting firms
costing less than $100,000 equivalent each, services for individual consultants under contracts
costing less than $50,000 equivalent each, local training, scholarships for girls and operating costs.
Special account. To facilitate disbursements, the government will open a Special Account
(SA) in the Central Bank for IDA's share of eligible expenditures. The authorized allocation would
be US$ 1.25 million representing about three months of disbursement. IDA would make an initial
deposit of US$ 650,000 upon credit effectiveness. Once the aggregated amount of withdrawals
from the Credit Account will have reached SDR 3.0 million, the fully authorized amount will be
paid. Disbursement of the IDA credit would be fully documented. All supporting documentation
will be retained by the PCU and/or GAMWORKS and the NGOs involved in the school building
program, and will be available for review as requested by IDA supervision missions and project
auditors.
