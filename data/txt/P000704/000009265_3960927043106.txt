MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL
DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA FOR A
PEASANT AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit
to the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE) for SDR66 million
equivalent (US$85 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
proposed credit would be on standard terms with 40 years maturity and would
help finance the Peasant Agricultural Development Project I (PADEP I).
2.       Background.  Relative to most Sub-Saharan low income countries,
Ethiopia enjoys a favorable agricultural environment. Nearly 50 percent of
the country comprises highlands above 1500 meters and possesses
comparatively good soils. Rainfall Is sufficient in most years to sustain
high agricultural crop production. All peasants have access to land
following a sweeping land reform program in 1975. An institutional
structure built around Peasant Associations provides wide coverage of
services to the peasant sector. Despite these positive factors, the past
decade witnessed stagnation in agricultural production. Because
agriculture constitutes a large proportion of Gross Domestic Product (about
45Z), accounts for the bulk of total exports (about 90Z) and is an
important source of raw materials for industry, the stagnation of
agriculture has led to a decline in per capita incomes and exports. The
main constraints to agricultural growth have included erosion of farmer
incentives, weak government sectoral services (especially for input supply
and distribution, and technology generation and dissemination), inadequate
resource allocation to peasant sector development and degradation of the
natural resource base. Superimposed on these constraints have been serious
droughts, including two in the last five years.
3.       IDA's approach to Ethiopia has been to concentrate project lending
in core areas where there is a history of close collaboration and effective
project implementation. Simultaneously, IDA has sought to engage the
government in a broad policy and institutional dialogue aimed at improving
efficiency and productivity of the economy. In agriculture, marketing and
producer pricing reforms have been at the center of discussions between IDA
and the government since 1982. Starting in 1979, the marketing of grains
in Ethiopia has increasingly been conducted by a parastatal, the
Agricultural Marketing Corporation (AMC), through a compulsory quota system
and restrictions on private traders. Between 1979 and 1987, official
producer grain prices remained virtually unchanged despite substantial
increases in the open market prices of grain and in the prices of
agricultural inputs and consumer goods. The effect of low and declining
(in real terms) procurement prices was reinforced by restrictions on
private merchant activities. In two of the three major grain surplus
regions, private merchants were not allowed to operate. More importantly,
movements of grain between the major surplus and consuming regions by
private merchants were prohibited. Producer market prices in most of the



-2-
surplus producing areas were depressed, while open market consumer prices
in deficit and urban areas were well above AMC's prices. The combination
of compulsory quotas, low prices, restrictions on trade, and a scarcity of
consumer goods in rural areas undermined the incentives for farmrs to
increase their use of improved inputs and raise the marketed surplua.
4.       In December 1987, following an intensive study by a team of
Ethiopian professionals, the Government introduced important reforms which
have considerably liberalized grain marketing. Producers in the surplus-
producing areas where private traders had been prohibited vill nov benefit
from large price increases on the open market where they may now sell their
'after-quota' surplus to newly licensed private grain traders. Also,
producer prices for official purchases, which presently account for about
20S of the estimated marketable surplus, have been raised.  The anticipated
price increases (from free market and quota sales) are expected to provide
farmers with adequate incentives to adopt improved technology (particularly
use of fertilizers) and to increase their marketed surplus. Furthermore,
resource allocation for peasant sector development has been increased,
major efforts made to improve technology generation and dissemination and a
Price Studies and Policy Institute established to improve the analytical
basis for official price policy in all sectors of the economy. PDIB is
also currently carrying out an exhaustive study of food security issues
including the adequacy of current food reserves and the efficiency in their
management. Weaknesses in sectoral services are also belng addressed
through a series of projects as part of the Government's multi-year Peasant
Agricultural Development Program which is now being supported by a number
of donors.
S.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Peasant Agricultural
Development Program is the centerpiece of both the Government's and IDA's
agricultural development strategy. The proposed project would be the first
of a series of projects supporting peasant agriculture for which IDA
financing has been requested. IDA's support is critical to: a) sustain
the Government's actions to improve the incentive framework; b) facilitate
the production response in the peasant sector; and c) mobilize the support
of other donors to the program. PADEP I follows up on two successive IDA
minimum package projects started in the early seventies and would reinforce
a number of other ongoing IDA-supported activities and complement
agricultural development projects financed by other donores ZEC In Shewa,
Italy in Arsi and Bale, AfDB in Sidamo, SI4A in Vollo aAd IhAD In Bararghe.
6.       Proiect obiectives and Strate&y.  The primary objectives of the
project would be to increase peasant foodgrain production, productivity and
incomes. The broad project strategy for achieving these goals would
include: (a) supporting improvements in the incentive framework for
producers; (b) improving efficiency in the management and delivery of
agricultural services; and (c) improving the availability of technology and
fertilizers to peasant farmers.
7.       Proiect Description.  The five-year project would comprise the



-3-
following main components: a) Strengthening MOA's management of sectoral
services through project coordination, ronitoring and evaluation, better
financial control, production of extension materials, and extension and
cooperative development; b) Expansion of the sectoral capacity to test
technology promotion; c) Support for the delivery of services in the north-
western zone including extension services, cooperative development, and
soil conservation watershed management; d) Improved input supply through
increased farm inputs, improved delivery by AISCO and better credit support
from AIDB; and e) Support for continuous pricing policy analysis. IDA
financing is provided for civil works, vehicles, equipment, incremental
fertilizers, conservation activities, training, technical assistance and
incremental operating costs. The total cost of the project is VS$118.6
million (of which the foreign exchange component is US$84.6 million).
Fertilizers represent a major component of project costs since a
substantial increase in demand is expected as a result of improvements in
farmer incentives and institutional services. IDA's financing would be on
a declining basis over five years so as to encourage government to fund
fertilizers from its regular resources. Counterpart funds from fertilizer
financing would be used to finance credit to farmers. A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disoursement are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank group operations in
Ethiopia are given in Schedule C and D respectively. A map (IBRD No.
21040) is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7386-ET dated September
28, 1988, is also attached.
8.       Actions Agreed Upon.  During negotiations, the following main
assurances were obtained from the governments a) To maintain producer
incentivess (i) to continue arrangements introduced in December 1987 for
establishing quotas and licensing non-government traders, ii) to inform IDA
by February 28 of each year the quota fixed for each region, and of the
number of traders licensed to operate in each region, (iii) to annually
review producer prices according to agreed criteria for all grains
purchased by AMC and all inputs sold by AISCO, and to inform IDA of these
prices by December 31 of each year, and (iv) to monitor and evaluate the
impact of the grain marketing and pricing reforms on production,
productivity, marketed surplus and farmer incomes according to an agreed
set of indicators and to report the findings to IDA semi-annually; b) To
improve the efficiency of the fertilizers sub-sector and ensure that
fertilizer funding arrangements are adequate and arpropriates (i) to
conduct.a study of the fertilizer sub-sector by June 30, 1990, under terms
of reference satisfactory to IDA, (ii) to send to IDA annually an adequate
financing plan for total peasant sector fertilizer purchases including that
to be financed by other donors and by PDRE, and (iii) to review jointly
with IDA AISCO's performance annually; c) To ensure effective proiect
implementation: (i) to maintain the Project Coordinating Committee (PCC)
with terms of reference and membership satisfactory to IDA, (ii) to cause
the PCC to send to IDA by April 30 in each year of the project, an action
program for project related activities for each participating agency and
department detailing the projected physical and financial targets to be
achieved under the project for the ensuing year, (iii) to cause the
Ministry of Agriculture to implement the agricultural extension activities
following the basic principles of the T&V system; and (iv) to conduct
jointly with IDA project implementation reviews annually.

9.       Proiect Benefits.  The project is expected to generate large
increases in grain production and farmer incomes through the supply of
fertilizers, support for marketing reforms and improvements in services.
The strengthening of MOA's and AISCO's services would improve their
efficiency and expand their coverage of farmers. The extensive training
aspects of the project would augment the local resources of trained
manpower directly serving the peasant sector as well as in incentive policy
analysis. Initially benefits to farmers would accrue mainly in the areas
of existing and potential grain surpluses. Production increases in the
grain deficit areas would only materialize over the longer term as the
efficiency of the supporting services improves and their coverage expands.
Consumers in urban and food deficit areas would benefit from increased
grain supply and more stable prices.
10.      Risks.  The main risks which could disrupt project implementation
and ach.evement of objectives are (i) a reversal of the reform program now
being implemented by the government; (ii) inadequate farmers' production
response due to social and political factors outside of project control;
(iii) insufficient government resources to sustain project activities; and
(iv) negative political interference in the technical and economic decision
making process. These risks could disrupt project implementation and
subvert project objectives. The project design, including as it does, the
monitoring and evaluation processes, the annual review and consultation
system, the assurances on operational procedures, and the conditionality on
maintaining producer incentives would reduce but not eliminate these risks.
While the risks are real, the payoff in one of the poorest countries of the
world with a large and increasing structural food deficit would be high and
fully justifies taking the risks involved.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recomend that
the Executive Directors app )ve the proposed credit.
