THIRD RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:               Kingdom of Thailand
Beneficiaries:          Office of the Rubber Replanting Aid Fund (ORRA),
Department of Agricultural Extension (DOAE), Rubber
Research Institute of Thailand (RRIT) and 113,000
rubber replanting farm families.
Loan Amount:            US$60 million equivalent.
Terms:                  Repayable in 17 years including a grace period of four
years at the standard variable interest rate.
Project Description:    The project would comprise:  (a) a four year time
slice of ORRAF's agricultural development program,
including new rubber replanting of about 50,000 ha
p.a. and continuation and completion of past replant-
ings to maturity (about 290,000 ha); (b) ORRAF's
related field administration, management and training
costs; Cc) upgrading of RRIT research centers;
(d) DOAE group orocessing and marketing centers and
replanter training; (e) technical assistance to
improve Ci) ORRAF's organization and management
structure; and (ii) RRT's adaptive research, base
line surveys and linkages between research and exten-
sion. Under the proposed project, the ORRAF program
would also be modified to: ensure more cost effective
use of financial and staff resources; re-orient tar-
gets, resources and procedures to reach the more needy
rubber smallholders under a special Needy Rubber
Smallholder Development Program; and improve coordina-
tion of technical and training support among key
rubber development agencies including a clearer demar-
cation of their responsibilities.
Risks:                  Low.  Implementation capacity of ORRAF (supported by
98% of project costs) is satisfactory. Provisions
have also been made to ensure that sufficient funding
would be available.

THAILAND
THIRD RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
A. The Agricultural Sector
1.01      Thailand's agricultural sector accounts for 25Z of GDP, 60% of
exports and 70% of employment. During 1960-75, the sector performed excep-
tionally vell and was able to achieve annual growth rates exceeding 5Z; since
1975, however, this has slowed to about 3.5%. Earlier growth was achieved
mostly through expansion of cultivated area, but in future crop production
must be intensified through increased inputs and diversified into higher value
products.
Government Agricultural Policy and Bank Support
1.02      The Government's main objective in agricultural development is
growth with equity. Since Thailand is self-sufficient in most foodstuffs and
has a relatively low population growth rate, agricultural growth implies
increased exports, which is a major objective. The Government's principal
strategies are: creation of an environment in which the private sector has
the incentives to increase production, marketing and exports; improved techni-
cal packages and support services for intensification; demarcation of poverty
areas for government support programs; and establishment of land use policy
for better utilization of land suitable for agriculture, including land
titling for individual farmers.
1.03      The Bank has supported these objectives and strategies through a
lending program to strengthen the technical and infrastructural base for
improving agricultural production and expanding project planning and imple-
menting capacity. Structural adjustment lending has supported improved
agriculture pricing policies, especially rice and rubber. Past Bank projects
have supported irrigation, tree crop development, credit, research and exten-
sion services of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC),
rural/area development (primarily Northeast and North) and land reform and
land titling. To date, the Bank has made 24 agricultural loans amounting to
$924 million, about 25Z of total lending to Thailand.
B. The Tree Crop Subsector and the Role of Rubber
1.04      Tree crops account for about 15% of the planted area in Thailand and
a similar proportion of the total value of agricultural production (Annexes 1
and 2). With the exception of oil palm, tree crop farmers in Thailand are
predominantly smallholders. Generally, tree crops have long immature periods
with high establishment costs, making it difficult for smallholders to estab-
lish the trees initially and then replant at the optimum time. Rubber and
coconut, which dominate the treecrop smallholder subsector, are normally grown
on soils not suitable for annual crops and play an important role in poverty
alleviation.



1.05     Rubber is the most important tree crop in Thailand.  Although some
530,000 farm families are directly engaged in rubber growing, about 5 million
people are estimated to be directly linked to rubber as planters, tappers,
traders and processors. Ninety percent of rubber is grown in the Southern
Region but it has been expanded to the East, and recently the Northeast, as an
alternative to cassava. The statistics are not very accurate but the total
rubber area is estimated to be about 1.6 million ha (1984), of which 20-30% is
low productivity, old rubber. About 480,000 ha (of which about 200,000 ha are
in production) have been replanted to high yielding rubber under the
Government-assisted replanting program of the Office of the Rubber Replanting
Aid Fund (ORRAF), (paragraphs 1.07 and 1.08). Rubber production and exports
have been increasing at about 5% p.a. over the last decade. In 1983 net
exports were about 550,000 tons (92Z of production) and contributed about 12Z
to Thailand's foreign exchange earnings. Coconut and oil palm, grown
commercially on about 390,000 ha and 54,000 ha respectively, are also mainly
confined to the South. Government recently reaffirmed the importance of
ORRAF's 50,000 ha/year replanting program, singling out its important
contribution to the Sixth Five Year Development Plan (1987-91) noteably in
export revenue generation and development of the Scuthern Region.
C. Rubber Support Services
1.06      Research and planting material production for all tree crops is the
responsibility of the Department of Agriculture (DOA). The DOA's rubber-
related activities are handled by the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand
(BRIT) while other tree crops fall under DOA's Horticulture Research
Institute. Except for immature rubber replanted by ORRAF, extension services
are provided by the Department of Agricultural Extension (DOAE). Credit is
supplied either by the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives
(BAAC) or private banks. Inputs, except for immature replanted rubber, are
provided through commercial channels. Marketing and processing of rubber are
carried out efficiently by the private sector. Among the agencies involved in
rubber develypment, ORRAF, RRIT and DOAE are the most important for rubber
replanting.-   Rubber support services are presently coordinated through a
Technical Assistance Coordinating Committee and a Planting Materials Committee
comprising ORRAF, RRIT and DOAE. Rubber policy is primarily determined
through a National Rubber Policy Committee (NRPC) chaired by the Minister of
Agriculture and through the ORRAF Board.
D. The Office of Rubber Replanting Aid Fund (ORRAF) Replanting Program
1.07     ORRAF was established in 1960, under the ORRAF Act, to replant
senile low yielding or abandoned rubber with high yielding varieties. ORRAF
administers the Replanting Fund which receives its income from a general cess
levied on rubber exports, supplemented when necessary by government subven-
tions (budgetary funds) and, since 1976, jointly by World Bank and Common-
wealth Development Corporation (CDC) loans (para. 1.09). Under the rubber
1/  Background on organizational structure and functions of ORRAF, RRIT and
DOAE are in Annex 3.



- 3 -
replanting scheme, ORRAF provides technical and financial support to small-
holders. Replanting assistance is provided in kind (high-yielding clonal
plant material, fertilizers and agro-chemicals) and in cash (payment for
maltholders' labor after completion of specified tasks) over a five and a
half year period.
1.08      The ORRAF replanting program is a highly effective means of trans-
ferring new technology to smallholders because it enforces an important
measure of discipLine that is unlikely to take place through regular extension
services. Improper husbandry (timing, amounts and types of fertilizer and
chemicals, etc.) during the immature period can jeopardize future yields; and
smalLholders, with their lack of capital and high sense of risk aversion, tend
to use lower than optimal inputs without the program. To date the ORRAF
program has enabled about 350,000 families to improve the quality of their
rubber (on average, more than quadrupling their rubber yields).-   During the
Second Rubber Replanting Project (Loan 2078-TH, 1982-86) about 192,000 ha
(averaging 48,000 ha/year) is being replanted and would provide an additional
250,000 tons of rubber exports worth about US$187.5 million (in 1986 prices)
per year at full maturity (e.g. by the year 2000). This compares very favor-
ably with the results of tree crop replanting agencies in other countries.
Thailand still has a high proportion of senile rubber (Annex 1) and has a
comparative advantage for growing rubber as a smallholder crop (low wage
rates, suitable growing conditions, effective private sector), especially in
the Southern Region. The proposed Sixth Five Year Development Plan (1987-91)
provides for ORRAF to continue rubber replanting at the rate of 50,000 ha per
Annum and the proposed Third Rubber Replanting Project would assist ORRAF to
meet these targets.
E. Lessons from Past Bank Tree Crop Lending and Needed Improvement
1.09      The Bank has provided two loans to the tree crop subsector:  the
First Rubber Replanting Project (Loan 1243-TH) for US$50 million, 1977-82; and
the Second Rubber Replanting Project (Loan 2078-Td) for US$142 million,
1982-86. Both loans were primarily to finance ORRAF's Rubber Replanting Pro-
gram, expanding it from nearly 23,000 ha p.a. in 1976 to the present rate of
nearly 39,000 ha per year. The project performance audit report for Loan
1243-TH_ reaffirmed the project's expected economic rate of return of 20Z but
drew attention to the need to: evaluate whether ORRAF involvement with rubber
smallholders should be extended beyond the present (5-1/2 years) period;
improve inter-agency coordination between ORRAF, RRIT and DOAE; reevaluate
rubber replanting financing and cost recovery arrangements; and assess
economic efficiency losses which might arise from the present cess/grant
system. During project supervision of the Second Project and preparation of
2/   Senile non-clonal rubber with minimal husbandry would yield about
300 kg/ha compared with average yields of nearly 1,400 kg/ha from a
reasonably well cared cloral replanting under ORRAF.

this project, the need to modify ORRAF's organization and management structure
became apparent, especially the need to (a) improve the cost effectiveness of
its operations, (b) improve rubber growing technology for different rubber
growing zones, (c) increase the period of ORRAF assistance from 5½ to 7½ years
to reduce the incidence of premature tapping and (d) revise the replanting
program to reach a larger 4umber of needy rubber farmers instead of just
expanding replanted area.-   These findings reflect the fact that, while ORRAF
is a well managed, efficient agency, the changing needs of the rubber
subsector require policy and institutional changes to accommodate them.  This
project addresses: (a) the difficulties faced by ORRAF in obtaining a stable
and sufficient source of income for its replanting target of 50,000 ha p.a.;
and (b) the need to more fully exploit further opportunities for (i) improving
smallholder replanters' productivity and income, (ii) reducing the cost of its
operations, and (iii) reaching a larger number of smaller/needy rubber
growers.
1.10      ORRAF Finances.  ORRAF's overall financial position, which is
largely dependent on the rubber cess, poses a continuing problem. Cess
revenues, which are based on an export price formula, together with rubber
export tax collections have always exceeded the cost of support to rubber
replanters. However, rubber export taxes go directly to general government
revenues, and ORRAF has to depend on the cess as the primary source of funds
for its operations. Cess income exceeded total ORRAF costs until 1974,
averaged about 72% of costs in 1975-79, and dropped to 50% in 1980-84. The
reduction was primarily due to unexpectedly low rubber prices and consequently
shortfalls in cess revenues. In addition to the financial problems affecting
the replanting program, funding shortfaLls for ORRAF administration have been
more acute. By law, 90% of cess revenue is allocated for the ORRAF Replanting
Program, 5% for ORRAF administration costs and 5% for rubber research (through
RRIT). The 5% allocation for administration has covered, on average, only
about one fifth of total ORRAF requirements. While administration costs can
be reduced through more cost effective operations (para. 3.05), a more
realistic allocation of cess revenues for ORRAF administration needs to be
introduced.
1.11      The uncertainty surrounding cess income during the Second Project
forced ORRAF to cut back its replanting program in 1984 from the planned
50,000 ha to only 36,700 ha. As a result, annual production of 30,000 tons of
rubber valued at US$22.5 million at full maturity will be foregone. If
interim funding, particularly for administration, had not been obtained from
CDC in late 1984, the 1985 program would have suffered also. Effective long
term planning and implementation and financial stability and control can only
be achieved by changing the cess formula and cess allocations for ORRAF. Some
4/   Socio-economic surveys undertaken in 1982/83 by ORRAF and the National
Institute for Development and Administration (NIDA) showed that, while
the replanting program has been widely dispersed in the rubber growing
areas, the beneficiaries have been primarily farmers with average size or
Larger rubber holdings.



steps have already been taken in this direction, and these will be consoli-
dated under the proposed project (see para. 3.02).
1.12.          Productivity Improvements.  Because of the long gestation
period of rubber, and the fact that improper husbandry in the early years
could undermine yields much later, the transfer of improved technology to
smallholders requires particularly intensive husbandry and input support
during the imanture period (up to 7-1/2 years). At present, ORRAF's
assistance to rubber smallholders is restricted to the first 5-1/2 years of
replanting, after which DOAE is responsible for technical advice. With
handover before full maturity, a high incidence of early tapping and impropar
tapping practices occurs, with adverse results on yields. One way to reduce
this would be for ORRAF (with its enforced discipline) to extend its
jurisdiction over replanters from 5-1/2 to 7-1/2 years. This initiative, to
be introduced under the proposed project (para. 2.04) would also permit one
more round of fertilizer to accelerate tree maturity. It would also enable
DOAE to more productively assist smallholders "graduating" from the replanting
program with proper panel opening and adoption of tapping systems most
appropriate for maximizing production and incomes under farm conditions. In
tandem with this initiative is the need for RRIT to develop technology
packages and practices that are more adapted to the various rubber zones in
Thailand. The project would also improve RRIT's Research Centers and provide
technical assistance to assess the relevance of research.
1.13      Assisting the More Needy Farmers.  The focus on the more needy
rubber growers is required because, while the replanting program has been very
effective in reaching the average sized rubber holding, large numbers of
small/needy farmers (especially those who cannot afford even to take advantage
of the "grant") have been left out. In addition to assisting such farmers
financially, many can benefit from government assistance in helping them
extend and develop their small rubber plots with adjacent plots presently not
eligible for replanting assistance. Similarly greater support through group
processing and marketing would enable them to improve the quality and price of
their unsmoked sheets. Since ORRAF's replanting target has stabilized, it can
devote greater attention to the more needy rubber grower in collaboration with
other government agencies, especially DOAE (paras. 3.10-3.13 below).
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Description
2.01      The proposed project would be the third in support of the ORRAF
program. Continued Bank lending is justified by the need to assist Government
in effecting the difficult policy and institutional changes needed to cater
for the evolving needs of the rubber subsector. Of particular importance is
the need to (a) change the rubber cess formula and the cess allocation to
stabilize ORRAF's financial position; (b) improve ORRAF's organization and
management structure; (c) strengthen the replanting program for the more needy
smallholders; and (d) strengthen technology transfer jointly with RRIT and
DOAE.



-6-
2.02     The project would include:
(a) A four year time slice of ORRAF's agricultural development program,
including new rubber replanting atarts of about 50,000 ha p.a. and
continuation and completion of past replantings to maturity (about
290,000 ha).
(b) ORRAF's related field administration, management and training costs;
(c) Upgrading of RRIT research centers.
(d) DOAE group processing and marketing centers, and replanter training.
(e) Technical assistance to improve:
(i)   ORRAF's organization and management structure; and
(ii)   RRIT's adaptive research, base line surveys and linkages
between research and extension.
Under the proposed project the ORRAF program would be modified to (a) ensure
more cost effective use of financial and staff resources (para. 3.05) and
(b) re-orient targets, resources and procedures to reach the more needy rubber
smallholders under a special Needy Rubber Smallholder Development Program
(paras. 3.10-3.13). Furthermore, arrangements for coordination of support
among key rubber development agencies (para. 3.07) and a clearer demarcation
of their responsibilities and contribution to the replanting program,
including the extension of ORRAF's assistance from 5½ to 7½ years, would be
introduced (paras. 3.08-3.09).
B. Detailed Features
ORRAF
2.03     Replanting Assistance.  ORRAF will continue to assist smallholders
to replant and maintain rubber through advice, training and the provision of
inputs and cash payments. The replanting assistance (the "grant"), presently
at B 4,500/rai (US$1,090/ha), has a 51% cash component (19Z for labor required
for land preparation and 32Z for maintenance) and a 49% materials-in-kind
component (chemicals 4Z, fertilizers 41%, and clonal/cover crop planting
materials 4W). Cash payments to smallholders are made only after certifi-
cation by ORRAF inspectors after completion of tasks.
2.04     Agricultural Development.  ORRAF's development program over the
project period would continue to focus on rubber replanting as follows:

42.6; 1982, 55.9; 1983, 49.1; 1984, 37.6; 1985, 54.6; and 1986, 50.0.
With increasing emphasis on the more needy smallholders (see paras 3.10 -
3.11), the average size of plots approved is expected to decrease from 1.3 ha
in 1987 to about 1.1 ha by 1990. Technical reassessments by RRIT and ORRAF
allow for new replantings to require less amounts (but more concentrated)
fertilizer for tree maintenance during the first six years and less cover crop
fertilizer than under the Second Project. Such a revision is not expected to
jeopardize overall yields of the replanted rubber. With the extension of
ORRAF assistance from 5½ years to 7½ years (para 1.12), one extra round of
compound fertilizer will, however, be added at the beginning of the seventh
year to boost tree girth. Increased attempts will also be made to ensure that
husbandry techniques are appropriate to the growing conditions of various
rubber growing regions. The primary clones used would be the well established
RRIN 600 (75Z of total) and, increasingly, the more precocious PR 255 and PR
261. About 69Z of plantings are expected to be in the form of budded stumps
(type 1 planting) and 31X green budded seedling in the field (type 2
planting). Planting material to be supplied by ORRAF's own nurseries during
the project period would be reduced to about 25-30% (from 75Z in 1984) with
the share of pri-rate nurseries and farmer cooperatives substantially increased
in the major rubber growing areas (para 3.05). Under the Second Project
(Ln. 2078-Tr), ORRAF has taken steps to hire a local consultant to assess the
extent ORRAF nurseries can be further reduced.
2.05      ORRAF Administration, Management and Training.  ORRAF's
administration and management costs (see Annex 4, Table 5) are expected to
remain at about 20% of total replanting costs throughout the project period.
ORRAF is doing an adequate job in training staff and beneficiaries (Working
Paper No. 6). The project would support the upgrading of ORRAF training

equipment and fellowship assistance for management training (to enable present
middle-level managers to take over upper level positions). Assurances were
obtained that ORRAF would carry out the training and administer the fellow-
ships under a program acceptable to the Bank.
Rubber Research Institute, Department of Agriculture (RRIT).
2.06      To support RRIT's adaptive research objective of providing extension
recommendations which are relevant to various rubber growing regions, the
project includes the upgrading of the Surat Thani RRC (covering the wet penin-
sular west coast and the drier peninsular east coast) and the expansion of
Chachoengsao RRC (catering for the drier East and Northeast Region). For
Surat Thani, the project will include: additional staff housing (for the
staff to be transferred from Haadyai RRC); administrative building, repair,
extension and equipping of existing offices and training school; the estab-
lishment of a small laboratory for routine soil, agronomy and plant pathology
tests; and 9 additional vehicles (including mobile units for training). The
project will also support similar developments for the newly established
Chachoengsao RRC  where the shortage of facilities (offices, training school
and laboratory and staff housing) is more acute than for Surat Thani. Some
eight vehicles are also included for Chachoengsao.
Department of Agricultural Extension (DOAE)
2.07      The project will support four main activities of DOAE:
(a) Training of graduating replanters. The program for replanters,
which will begin about six months before initial tapping, would be
supported under the project through the financing of 17 well
equipped mobile units, each manned by a group of support staff, to
visit districts/subdistricts where graduating replanters are
concentrated. At each district/subdistrict the District Extension
Officer or the Provincial Subject Matter Specialists would conduct
the training sessions covering about 20 farmers/day.
(b) Rubber processing and marketing improvement. The project would
finance the establishment of five group processing and marketing
center (GPMC) modules per year. Each GPMC module would comprise
about 25 equipped group processing centers (built by farmers with
materials provided by the project) feeding into a marketing
center. These GPMCs would form part of the Needy Ru.'ber
Smallholders Development Program (NRSDP) -- see paras 3.10 - 3.12.
(c)  High level tapping with yield stimulation (HLTS).  This activity
will be undertaken through the training and provision of materials
for 150 farmer demonstrations per year (two per GPMC). Each demons-
tration would be undertaken with at least 3 potential adopters.
(d) Strengthening the Institutional Capability of the DOAE (especially
its Rubber Subdivision and regional offices). Financing will be
provided to improve the programming and monitoring of activities and
the preparation of training materials Lhrough equipment, materials
and vehicle support.



-9-
Technical Assistance
2.08      Technical assistance will be provided as follows:
(a) ORRAF. To improve the organizational and management structure,
22 man-months of local consultancy would be financed to reassess:
ti) the organizational structure of ORRAF; (ii) the links between
technical and financial staff; (iii) the extent of decentralization
needed; and (iv) information and organizational needs for improving
its planning and monitoring capability including the role of the
PlAnning and Monitoring Unit. About 9 man-months of additional
consultancies would also be financed to improve ORRAF's socio-
economic survey work.
(b) RRIT. To improve the emphasis of adaptive research and its
recommendations for rubber farmers, 6 man-months of consultancies
would be financed to: (i) review the conduct of adaptive research,
its recommendations and usefulness for extension to RRIT's rubber
zones; (ii) recommend measures to strengthen the link between
research and extension; and (iii) assist RRIT in undertaking and
evaluating base line (aerial photography/satellite imagery) area and
yield surveys.
Assurances were obtained that: (a) not later than May 31, 1987, ORRAF and
BRIT would have employed these consultants under terms-of-reference acceptable
to the Bank; and (b) that the consultants reports would be sent to the Bank
for comment together with an action plan for implementation.
C. Project Costs
2.09      Total project cost (including taxes) is estimated at about
US$263 million of which about US$72 million (27Z) is toreign exchange (see
Table 2.2). Costs are based on quantity and unit price estimates prepared by
ORRAF, DOAE and RRIT. Unit price estimates for vehicles, equipment and civil
works are in line with the Budget Bureau guidelines and recent project civil
works contracts.
2.10      Price contingencies amount to 11  of total b_g7e costs, at the
following percentage rates of price increase per annum- :
1986       1987         1988       1989        1990

5/   Price contingencies have been applied to all project cost items except
for the labor costs of replanting which ORRAF proposes to maintain at the
current nominal level.

Prices are as of March 1986. Physical contingencies of 10% have been included
for civil works only; no provision has been made for physical contingencies on
other items because the project supporta a time slice of an ongoing investment
program where a large proportion of the operating expenses are known, and the
major sources of uncertainty are not related to physical implementation.
Project cost details are in Annex 4.
D. Financing
2.11      The proposed Bank loan of US$60 million and the CDC financing of
L10 million (US$14.5 million) would cover 29% of project costs, slightly
exceeding the foreign exchange requirements. The CDC loan and the Bank loan
will be passed on by Government to ORRAF as a grant. The remaining local
costs of ORRAF would be covered by allocation from the Budget Bureau or BOB
(US$8.8 million) and ORRAF's own resources (US$175.3 million), primarily from
the cess. The Bank loan would contain cross default provisions with the CDC
loan including the provision that the CDC loan become effective by March 31,
1987. The Government proposes to finance the RRIT and DOAE components (paras.
2.06-2.07) with US$1.8 million from the ongoing National Agricultural Research
Project (Loan 1922-TH) and US$550,000 from the ongoing National Agricultural
Extension Project (Loan 1752-TH), and US$2.5 million from its local
resources. The Government is aLso seeking external grant financing for
technical assistance for RRIT (US$120,000) and ORRAF (US$60,000) and for RRIT
vehicles at Chachoengsao (US$47,000), which would reduce the government's
local contribution or Bank financing accordingly.

2.13      Of total compound fertilizer contracts costing US$77.0 million,
about 95% (US$74.0 million) would be procured in bulk by ORRAF through inter-
national competitive bidding (ICS) in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
A preference equal to 15% of the c.i.f. cost or the customs duty, whichever is
lower, would be extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids.
The following contracts would be awarded on the basis of local competitive
bidding (LCB) in accordance with procurement procedures acceptable to the
Bank: (a) rock phosphate fertilizers and agro-chemicals (up to US$9.8 mil-
lion); (b) vehicles and equipment with contracts more than US$30,000 each and
(c) civil works. Other contracts for vehicles, equipment and materials
(including supplies, fuel and spare parts) costing less than US$30,000 each,
up to an aggregate amount of US$400,000, would be purchased by prudent
shopping on the basis of at least three price quotations. Urgen'ly needed
compound fertilizer (up to US$3 million limit) could also be purchased by
prudent shopping. Consultancies would be selected in accordance with Bank
guidelines. Administrative expenditures (ORRAF field development staff
salaries) are not subject to procurement. For all contracts estimated to
exceed $500,000, prior review by the Bank would be required.
F. Disbursement
2.14      The proposed Bank loan of $60 million would be disbursed to ORRAF as
follows:
(a) 1002 of the foreign exchange expenditures for directly imported
equipment, vehicles, fertilizers, and chemicals or 100% of the local
expenditures (ex-factory price net of taxes) for items manufactured
locally;
(b) 50% of local expenditures for vehicles, equipment, fertilizer, and
chemicals procured locally;
(c) 100% of total ORRAF expenditures for consultants' services and
training; and
(d) 65% of ORRAF's field salaries.
Bank disbursements for training, salaries of ORRAF field offices and for
vehicles, equipment and materials with contracts of less than US$20,000 each
would be made against statements of expenditure (SOE). The statements of
expenditure would be certified by ORRAF. Supporting documentation will be
retained by ORRAF and made available for review by supervision missions.
These statements would be audited by the Office of the Auditor General.

/a   Second Rubber Replanting Project.
The disbursement estimates are based on the actual rate of disbursement under
the Second Rubber Replanting Project with adjustments made for faster dis-
bursements under SAP provisions in the second project. A one year lag between
projected investment and disbursements has been allowed for vehicles, equip-
ment, civil works and studies and a six months lag for fertilizer, chemicals,
payments for labor and field administration expenditures. Being the third
project of its kind, disbursements are expected to be faster than the histor-
ical average disbursement profile for all agricultural projects in Thailand.
The closing date will be September 30, 1991.
2.16      In order to provide for efficient disbursement of Bank loan pro-
ceeds, a Special Account for the ORRAF component would be opened in dollars in
a bank with an initial deposit of US$3.0 million. Applications for
replenishment of this account would be submitted quarterly or whenever the
Special Account is drawn down to 50% of its initial deposit whichever is
earlier.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
3.01      With Bank assistance since 1976, the efficiency of ORRAF's yearly
procurement and distribution of inputs and operational support for the
replanting program is well established. Implementation schedules (see
Annex 4, Table 12) are, therefore, presented only for consultancy support
(ORRAF and RRIT) and for buildings and civil works (RRIT). The primary
concern for project implementation relates to: (a) the institutional
development of ORRAF; (b) the coordination of support services among ORRAF,
DOAE and RRIT; and (c) the required effort to reach more needy rubber
smallholders.
A. Institutional Development of ORRAF
ORRAF Financing and the Cess
3.02      Steps to improve the predictability and adequacy of ORRAF's funding
have been initiated with the approval of the draft amendment of the ORRAF Act
by the ORHAF Board, NRPC and Cabinet in July 1985. This amendment (a) changes
the price dependent cess formula to a flat (baht/kg) rate, and (b) increases
the proportion of cess revenue allocated for ORRAF administration costs from
5Z to 10%. However, since the parliamentary approval process could take years
(and passage cannot be guaranteed), the financing arrangements for the pro-
posed project have been based on the existing cess formula and allocation
system. During the interim period, an assurance was obtained from Government
and ORRAF that annual reviews, commencing not later than October 1, 1987,
would be held among the Bank, ORRAF and Government to ensure and agree on
adequate funding. A task force, comprising representatives from ORRAF, MOAC,
Fiscal Policy Office, NESDB, DOAE and RRIT and farmers representatives would
be appointed by the ORRAF Board to analyze the problem and make recommenda-
tions for this tripartite review. Government intends, in any case, to press
for the passage of the ORRAF Act amendments during the project period as a
matter of priority and assurances were obtained from Government that it would
take the necessary steps by September 30, 1990, to introduce a flat rate (Baht
per kg) cess and increase the proportion of cess revenues for ORRAF
administration costs to at least 10%.
Financial Arrangements
3.03      To minimize disruption in funding (see para 1.11) a conservative
assessment of cess revenues has been made, based on projected rubber prices
and historical forecasting experience (Annex 8), and Government has agreed
that ORRAF would continue to draw on the interest payments from surpluses in
the replanting account towards administration costs. It is estimated that at
completion of the proposed project (September 30, 1990) ORRAF would require
about $91 million (1986 constant dollars) through 1997 to maintain and com-
plete immature rubber replantings underway. Assurances were obtained that,
after project completion, Government would provide ORRAF with the necessary
funds to bring into production ongoing rubber replantings initiated under the
project.



- 16 -
Adjustment of "Grant" Payments
3.04      The success of the replanting program has been helped by the
scheduling of "grant" replanting payments to effect timely input use and yet
provide sufficient incentives for critical husbandry.  Assurances were
obtained that, during the project period, Government, ORRAF and the Bank will
hold joint reviews annually, commencing by October 1, 1987, to determine the
adequacy of the "grant" taking into account: (a) the cost of providing
fertilizer and other material inputs in adequate uantities, and (b) the
sufficiency of cash payments for farmers' labor.6 The analysis and
recommendations for this review would be undertaken by the proposed task force
of the ORRAF Board to help Government analyze the adequacy of ORRAF financing
(para 3.02).
Improving Cost Effectiveness
3.05      To improve cost effectiveness, ORRAF has initiated the following
measures to reduce costs:
(a) Reduction in ORRAF nurseries producing planting materials
(especially those experiencing large losses and those located in
areas where private nurseries are readily available). With the
implementation of the recently agreed guidelines for nursery
reduction, annual losses amounting to at least $0.7 million can be
eliminated.
(b) Elimination of fertilizer cost subsidies to defray part of farmers'
cost in transporting fertilizer transport costs from ORRAF stockists
to the farm (saving about one million dollars per year).
(c) Net reduction of fertilizer and chemical use for trees and cover
crops (para. 2.04) and expected retention of lower ylan budgeted
fertilizer/agro-chemical price savings for FY85-86.-
(d) Improvement of staff productivity through (i) streamlining the
applications and approval process and (ii) increased computerization
of replanting records.
6/   Project cost estimates have factored in the likely increase in material
input costs but not the labor costs.
7/   The savings in 1985-86 (up to US$ 5 million) are due to lower than
projected fertilizer and agro-chemical prices which had, in the past,
been given as extra cash payment to replanters. For replanting after
FY86, these savings would be used up through (a) the required extra round
of fertilizer proposed under the project and (b) expected increases in
fertilizer costs.



- 17 -
Technical assistance to effect (a) and (d) is being financed under the Second
Project (Loan 2078-TH). Assurances were obtained that ORRAF would complete,
under the proposed project, the relevant cost reduction measures recently
initiated through the Second Project.
Improving Organization and Management
3.06      The cost saving measures oiutlined in para 3.05 are short- to medium-
term in nature. For the longer term, reorganization of ORRAF (to achieve
greater decentralization and improve planning and monitoring) is needed. The
decentralization of technical and financial staff (para 2.08) would largely
depend on the streamlining of farmer application processing and computeriz-
ation proposals. The improvement in planning capability would depend not only
on increased commitment to planning by ORRAF management but also on the estab-
lisbment of a framework for data collection which would require contributions
from other agencies at both the central and field levels (see para 3.07(c)
below) and adoption of the recommendations of the management consultants to be
financed under the project (para. 2.08).
B. Coordination of Support Services for Rubber (Annex 5).
3.07      The present National Rubber Policy Committee (NRPC), which is
chaired by MOAC with RRIT, DOAE, ORRAF, Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE)
and private sector representation, would establish three technical subcomm-
ittees under the project. The subcommittees would promote discussion of
technical issues in the rubber subsector and effective cooperation among
rubber-related government agencies and with the private sector. The sub-
committees would review technical developments for the NRPC to enable it to
carry out its mandate including inter alia: (a) approving changes in
technical recommendations for the replanting program; (b) assigning
responsibilities for sale or purchase of planting material; (c) reviewing
training and research programs in rubber and (d) reviewing the technical
feasibility of rubber programs. The specific subcommittees are as follows:
(a) Subcommittee on Planting Materials. With ORRAF reducing its nursery
activities and with many other agencies now involved in rubber pro-
duction, a close monitoring of planting material requirements, at
least two years in advance, is critical. In addition to the con-
cerned agencies, the private sector should be included in this
subcommittee because they are the largest category of planting
material producers. Under the purview of the NRPC, the working
group could also be used to prevent pricing abuse for budwood/budded
stumps through market control by the private sector. The Sub-
committee would also monitor the rationalization of government
nurseries. Since ORRAF has already started on this (para. 2.04), a
similar initiative is needed by RRIT.
(b)  Subcommittee on Extension, Training and Demonstration.  This is
needed to re-evaluate agency programs and linkages and to
periodically review changing needs. It will be responsible for
overseeing the performance of extension/training activities for the
Replanting Program (see para 3.09 below).



- 18 -
(c) Rubber Statistics Subcommittee. This would be established to ensure
consistent collection, monitoring and analysis of area, yield and
production data among RRIT, the OAE, DOAE, and ORRAF at the central,
provincial and district levels.
Assurances were obtained that the proposed NRPC Technical Subcommittees would
be established (by December 31, 1986) and maintained; details of the formal
establishment of these subcommittees will be provided to the Bank shortly.
C. Extension and Training Responsibilities for the Replanting Program
3.08      To ensure a clearer demarcation of responsibilities for extension,
demonstration and training, assurances were obtained that the following man-
date would be confirmed by Government through a MOAC Ministerial order by
December 31, 1986:
(a) ORRAF would continue training beneficiaries for the pretapping
(development) phase and ORRAF support would be extended from 5½
years to 7½ years from start of replanting to reduce the incidence
of premature tapping.
(b) RRIT would be responsible for training trainers from DOAE or ORRAF
and for training replanters in basic activities, which require
lengthy training such as how to tap or bud properly.
(c) DOAE would be responsible for extension during the mature period and
for training graduating replanters in, for example, how to initiate
tapping and what tapping systems are best suited for their
situations.
The technical assistance provided to RRIT under the project (para. 2.08) will
also assist ORRAF, RRIT and DOAE in jointly re-evaluating the objectives,
detailed content and linkage of their training and demonstration programs.
3.09      In addition to strengthening existing training programs undertaken
by ORRAF and RRIT, a new (half-day) training program for graduating
replanters, would be established in DOAE. The new program would be focussed
on certain key areas including: convincing graduating replanters (especially
the first time replanter) on the use of appropriate tapping systems; how to
actually initiate tapping properly; prevention and control of tapping panel
diseases; and improved processing and group marketing. After the joint selec-
tion and scheduling of graduating farmers (by DOAE and ORRAF at the provincial
level), training through DOAE mobile units would be undertaken at the subdis-
trict level before tapping is initiated. If necessary, ORRAF mobile units
could supplement DOAE activities. The extension and training component of
this project will focus on graduating replanter training, and a progress
report would be prepared annually by DOAE for the Subcommittee on extension
and training (para 3.07). High level tapping and group processing/marketing
centers will be supported under a special Needy Rubber Smallholder Development
Program (see paragraphs 3.10 and 3.12 below).



- 19 -
D. Reaching the Needy Replanters
3.10      Nearly 11% and 32% of rubber farmers have rubber holdings of less
than 5 rai and 10 rai respectively. To deepen the impact of the replanting
program (see para. 1.13) and to achieve Government's objective of reaching the
more needy farmers, a special Needy Rubber Smallholders Development Program
(NRSDP) would be initiated through the National Rubber Policy Committee (NRPC)
by December 31, 1986. NRPC would select priority districtsJsubdistricts,
where the more needy farmers are concentrated, to focus rubber support
services and improve productivity and incomes. Farm size and income criteria
in selecting NRSDP target areas would be jointly agreed by members of a Task
Force, to be appointed by NRPC, comprising representatives of the OAE, MOAC,
NESDB, DOAE, RRIT, BAAC, Royal Forestry Department (RFD) and ORiAF.
Districts/subdistricts under the National Poverty Areas Development program
would automatically be included. Further details are in Annex 6.
3.11      In its attempt to reach the more needy replanters, ORRAF would:
(a) modify its application questionnaires and revise field staff
performance targets and incentives to permit better target farmer
selection. It would also change replanting assistance criteria to
permit limited consolidation of rubber plots. These changes will
not compromise the technical standards of the project.
(b) introduce potentially credit-worthy clients for BAAC to determine
their eligibility for subsistence and supplementary replanting
credit.
3.12      In the NRSDP districts/subdistricts:
(a) DOAE would focus its promotion of group processing/marketing centers
(GPMCs) and HLTS demonstrations (para 2.07 (b)).
(b) NOAC would reorient its supplementary assistance fund (e.g. through
loans from the Farmers Aid Fund) to permit the poorer farmers served
by the GPMCs to hold back their rubber sheets from dailt/sale and
take advantage of higher prices from marketing centers.-
(c) RFD would issue lease agreements for replanters in gazetted forest
areas if ORRAF undertakes the needed surveys on their behalf. Since
ORRAF has limited capacity to undertake such surveys extensively,
RFD would give top priority to issuing the "right to farm" (Sor Tor
Kor) certificates in the identified target districts. ORRAF would,
under a pilot program in forest reserves not due for Sor Tor Kor
issuance, assist replanters for a nominal fee to obtain the lease
agreements.
91   DOAE, which has been allocated a revolving fund of A 10 million per year
by MOAC for the GPMCs from the Farmers Aid Fund, would earmark its use in
NRSDP districts/subdistricts.



- 20 -
3.13      The NRSDP task force would also be responsible for monitoring the
progress of the program. Assurances were obtained that the above task force
would be established (by December 31, 1986) and that the above arrangements
(paras. 3.10-3.12) would be adhered to. Details of the task force's formal
establishment will be provided to the Bank shortly.
E. Monitoring and Evaluation
3.14      The Planning and Monitoring Unit (PMU) in ORRAF is responsible for
monitoring the implementation of the rubber replanting program particularly
with regard to the socio-economic impact of rubber replanting, smallholder
incentives and program participation. Its role in the administrative struc-
ture of ORRAF will be reexamined with technical assistance provided under the
project (para. 2.08). While information for monitoring the rubber subsector
will be considerably improved under the project through the coordinated effort
of OAE, DOAE, RRIT and ORRAF, (para. 3.07(c)), specific surveys to assess the
impact of the replanting program need to be continued. In 1982/83 the PMU and
the National Institute for Development and Administration (NIDA) collaborated
on a socio-economic survey of rubber replanters and new planters. The
information gathered in the survey (covering about 1,000 farms) has provided
some useful insights into the characteristics of ORRAF beneficiaries.
Technical assistance provided under the project (para. 2.08) would evaluate
the PMU/NIDA study and recommend needed changes which would permit year-to-
year monitoring of sub-sample performance and socia-economic impact. For the
research/extension components, monitoring will be undertaken through the
relevant NRPC Technical Subcommittees (para. 3.07). A Project Completion
Report would be prepared by ORRAF and submitted to the Bank.
F. Accounts and Audits
3.15      ORRAF's accounts are audited by the Office of the Auditor Ceneral at
the end of each financial year on the basis of guidelines recommended by the
Bank for the Second Tree Crops Project. Internal auditing is carried out by a
special unit which is responsible to the Deputy Director for Finance and
Administration. The internal audit unit staff are competent and ORRAF's
accounting and auditing procedures are satisfactory. Assurances were obtained
that ORRAF would: (a) maintain, in accordance with sound accounting practices,
records of its financial and operational activities; (b) have its accounts for
each fiscal year audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, in
accordance with appropriate auditing procedures consistently applied; and (c)
submit to the Bank within six months of the end of every fiscal year a
certified copy of the auditor's report including a separate opinion in respect
of disbursements made on the basis of statements of expenditure.



- 21 -
3.16      Assurances were obtained from Government that the R.1    and DOAE
would, under similar arrangements for existing Bank projects:_
(a) maintain, in accordance with sound accounting practices, project accounts
covering all project expenditures; (b) have project accounts for each fiscal
year audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, in accordance
with appropriate auditing procedures; and (c) submit to the Bank within six
months of the end of every fiscal year during project implementation a
certified copy of the auditor's report.
IV. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, PRICES AND BENEFITS
A. Production
Impact of ORRAF
4.01      With continuation of the 50,000 ha/year ORRAF Program under the
project, rubber plantings in Thailand would total some 67,000 ha/year
(17,000 ha being private replanting by people not eligible for ORRAF assi-
stance or new planting) until the mid-1990s (see Table 4.1). Thereafter ORRAF
replantings undertaken in the 1960s will come due fqr second round replanting
and annual plantings would increase to 82,000 ha.11
4.02      Based on these planting rates and the output from senile rubber,
total rubber production with the ORRAF program would be slightly lower in the
late 1980s and early 19909 than without the program because of production
foregone as a result of felling low-yielding old rubber trees for replanting
(Table 4.2). However, from 1995 onwards, the impact of ORRAF replanting would
be substantial as a result of production increases averaging 17,000 tons per
annum up to the year 2000 compared to a 10,000 ton per annum drop without the
program. By 2015 rubber output from ORRAF replanting would total one-half
million tons more than without the program.
10/ National Agricultural Research Project (Loan 1922-TH), 1981-89 assisting
DOA; and Second National Agricultural Extension Project (Loan 1752-TH),
1980-85 assisting DOAE.
11/ This scenario assumes that OREAF would expand its replanting program to
65,000 ha/year in 1996 (which it is capable of undertaking and for which
the area is available). Whether it wll actually do so depends on
Government's long term goals for ORRAF. Without the ORRAF program, it is
estimated that rubber plantings would drop significantly to 37,000 ha per
year. More discussion is contained in the rubber production model
(Appendix 2, Working Paper 7). These estimates are based on (a) the
moderate financial returns to replanting without ORRAF (para. 4.13) and
(b) the continued difficulty in obtaining medium- to long-term credit for
the majority of farmers replanting with their own resources.

Project Production
4.03      Project yields are assumed tc increase from about 900 kg/ha in the
first year of tapping to peak yields of about 1.9 tons/ha (sixth to eighth
year of tapping) declining to 1.1 tons/ha by the 16th year of tapping (see
Annex 2). Incremental production directly attributable to investment in the
200,000 ha of new replanting under the project would total 4.1 million tons
over a 35 year period. The production increment is expected to peak at about
260,000 tons p.a. by the tern of the century.
B. Marketing
4.04      Incremental rubber production would be marketed along present lines
uith farmers selling air dried sheets to local traders or through group mar-
keting organizations dealing directly with wholesalers and exporters. In
either case, exporters would normally buy graded unsmoked sheets which they



- 23 -
would subsequently export. Local traders would continue to buy scrap rubber
which would be used by block rubber manufacturing plants.
4.05      Thailand has had decades of successful experience in handling
expanding rubber exports and has a number of well organized and effective
exporters. Consequently, no problems are foreseen in dealing with the
projected export increases over the next 10 to 15 years. The main market for
incremental rubber will continue to be Japan although Thailand also sells to
other major markets such as Singapore, New York and London. Quality of Thai
rubber exports is adequate, but not high, with the bulk of its ribbed smoked
sheet (RSS) exports being Grade 3. With increasing quantities of rubber being
marketed through the Government Marketing Organizations (where the quality is
relatively high for smallholder production), it is anticipated that the
average quality will improve over the next decade. Nevertheless, the market
for RSS 3 rubber, especially for tire manufacture in Japan, will continue to
be good since Thai RSS 3 rubber is low cost, enjoys locational advantage for
the Japanese market and has an advantage in that most Japanese tire
manufacturers are equipped to process RSS rubber. As long as Thailand
continues to produce such rubber cheaply and export it reliably, the Japanese
market should remain stable.
C. Product Price and Pricing
4.06      Financial prices are based on Bank projections for world rubber
prices adjusted for international freight, the domestic cost of marketing and
the present level of rubber taxation. Details are given in Annex 7. The
average farmgate rubber price is based on the assumption that 92% of output
would, on average, be unsmoked sheet of RSS 3 quality and 8% would be scrap.
Estimated financial and economic prices for rubber are slmmarized in

4.07      Government's rubber pricing policy is predicated on ensuring
consistency of export taxation with the Malaysians. Experience in the past
five years has shown that when export taxation in Thailand is out of line with
its neighbor, smuggling occurs. This was especially critical in late
1983/early 1984 when Thailand's total export taxation (comprising the export
tax and cess) was nearly double that for Malaysia and an estimated 5,000 tons
(worth about US$29 million) per month was being smufOed into Malaysia.
Thailand has been steadily reducing its export tax -   from being 30% of the
f.o.b. price in 1980 (of which 80% or B 4.9 was export tax and 20% or B 1.3
was cess) to 13Z (with export tax and cess being approximately equal) in late
1984. The tax and cess lowers farm gate level prices of rubber and may dis-
courage the planting of new rubber, discourage other potentially more profit-
able use of senile rubber land and encourage over-intensive tapping detri-
mental to sustaining yields, but, in practice, pricing policy has to be con-
sidered as only on T37f many important factors affecting farmers' planting and
tapping decisions.-    Government realizes the implications and has been
reducing the export tax as the means of ensuring consistency with the
Malaysian situation. The continuation of the cess for the replanting program
is justified through its importance in ensuring the continuance of the
replanting program (see Section D below) and its contribution to cost recovery
(see Section F below).
D. Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.08      The continuance of the replanting program is fully justified by:
(a) the contribution of US$228 million of foreign exchange earnings
(1986 constant dollars' per year at full maturity;
(b) the employment generation of about 119,000 man-years per annum at
full development;
(c) the widely distributed benefits covering 113,000 rubber growing
households, most of whom are in relative poverty;
(d) the increase in family incomes of beneficiaries by an average of
63%; and
12/ For ease of comparison an equivalent gazetted price of l8c/kg
(corresponding f.o.b. price B 21/kg) is assumed for the comparisons.
13/ The efficiency cost of these distortions are discussed in detail in
Annex 7.



- 25 -
(e) adequate economic rate of return (18Z) after taking into account
(i) costs of administering the ORBAF program, (ii) the opportunity
cost of replanting senile rubber land, and (iii) 19e cost of
distortions to rubber prices implied by the cess.,
Macroeconomic Benefits
4.09      The impact of the project on Thailand's rubber production would be
substantial (see paras. 4.01-4.03). By the year 2015 incremental rubber pro-
duction worth over US$600 million annually would result from having continued
the ORRAF replanting program beyond 1986 (Table 4.2). Incremental production
directly attributable to investment under this project would total about
US$3.8 billion over a 35-year period (Annex 7, Table 10).
4.10      Direct project beneficiaries would total 113,000 families (or about
1/2 million people) replanting 167,000 plots.  The long-run employment impact
of the 1987-90 ORRAF program would be to increase agricultural employment from
1995 to 2015 by an average of 119,000 man-years p.a. in the rubber producing
areas (Annex 7, Table 8).
4.11      Analysis of farm survey data from smallholders participating in the
ORRAF replanting program (Working Paper No. 3) indicates that: (a) on
average, income from paid employment amounts to about half of net family
income; and (b) many rubber farmers employ hired labor for tapping (typically
on a product share basis). From this data and field observations, it appears
that labor is quite mobile and there are adequate employment opportunities in
the rural southern areas. Thus, no problems are foreseen in absorbing labor
released by the project in the medium term, or reactivating it in the 1990s.
In addition to direct employment created at the farm-level, the project would
result in increased job opportunities in the marketing and processing
industries as a result of extra labor required to handle the incremental
rubber output.
4.12      One of the important long-term benefits of the project would be the
impact of the project's increased needy farmer emphasis (para. 3.11). The
-PMC and HLTS assistance would directly benefit nearly 10,000 needy rubber
farm families. The secondary effect of improving incomes of other replanting
beneficiaries (through increased demand for hired labor, for example) could be
almost as large.
14/ Because the cess reduces the farmgate price for rubber, it may discourage
the planting of new rubber, discourage other potentially more profitable
use of senile rubber land and encourage overintensive tapping detrimental
to sustaining yields. The efficiency costs of these distortions are
discussed in more detail in Annex 7.



- 26 -
Farm Level Financ:al Impact on the Rubber Enterprise
4.13      The farm level financial impact of the ORRAF replanting program
depends on (a) the girth at which the farmers open up the tree for tapping
(full girth - 50 cm or less than full girth - averaging 44 cm); (b) the type
of tapping labor used (sharetapper or hired labor) and (c) the system of
exploitation (e.g. daily or alternate daily tapping with alternative types of
spiral cuts). Per hectare financial models have been developed to reflect
replanting under alternative exploitation systems. These models are summa-
rized in Table 4.4 and details are provided in Working Paper No. 7. Models A,
B and C represent the most likely "with project" scenarios. With the exten-
sion of ORRAF supervision from 5-1/2 years to 7-1/2 years (paras. 2.04 and
3.08) it is expected that under the project 20% of farmers would tap alternate
daily with tree opening at 50 cm girth (Model A), 60% would tap daily at 50 cm
girth (Model B) while 20% would tap daily at 44 cm tree girth (Model C). This
will represent an improvement over current tapping practices of farmers, 50%
of whom are currently estimated to open the tree prematurely at 44 cm girth
with a consequent loss in yield and income. While an estimated 85% of ORRAF
replanters tap their trees with share tapping labor (as profiled in Models A,
B and C), 15Z use daily paid labor. Models D, E, and F show the returns to
replanters using daily paid tapping labor. Models G and H permit comparison
of the returns to farmers replanting without ORRAF assistance with that of
ORRAF replanters. The alternative to replanting in all financial models is
continued tapping of old rubber trees for up to three years after which, given
projected prices for rubb 5,and for labor, continued tapping would prove
financially unattractive.-
4.14      Table 4.4 shows that farmers replanting with ORRAF assistance would
suffer an initial income loss of about US$149-166 per hectare p.a. during the
first seven years after replanting. Once the trees come into tapping, how-
ever, average net rubber incomes would increase substantially from US$489/ha/
year (Model C) to US$709/ha/year (Hodel A) with the typical farmer receiving
US$661/ha/year (Model B). Farmers using daily paid labor for tapping
(Models D, E, F) would experience even higher rubber income increases ranging
from US$586-983/ha/year. For farmers replanting with their own resources in
the absence of an ORRAF program, assistance, the reduction in income during
the initial years after replanting would be heavier (averaging US$52/ha/year
higher than for ORRAF-assisted replanters) partly as a result of the longer
gestation period for trees receiving lower levels of "'uuts. Average net
incomes during tapping years would be 20% lower than those of ORRAF-assisted
farmers. The moderate financial rate of return (FRR) to a farmer replanting
with his own resources (15%) compared to replanting with ORRAF assistance
(252) indicate that replanting rates in the absence of an ORRAF program would
be considerably lower than with continuation of the program.
15/ Except for the relatively few farmers tapping with unpaid family labor
with no alternative employment opportunities.

Impact on Family Income
4.15      The typical (median) ORRAF-assisted replanter owns about 4 ha of
land of which about 2 ha is under rubber. The total family income of such a
replanter is g7timated at US$1,249 per annum or US$208 per capita per annum in
1986 prices. 1    The effect of a typical 1.2 ha replant on the family would be
to reduce its income by an average of US$35 per capita/per annum for the first
seven years of the replanting and thereafter to increase it by US$132 per
annum or by 632 for the 20 years the trees are in tapping. Over the life of
the replant, per capita family incomes would increase by an average of 43%
(from US$208 to US$298 per annum) compared to a 30% increase, at most, in the
"without project" case. The impact of the replant would be therefore to
improve the position of the typical rubber growing family substantially within
the relative poverty group bringing its per capita income closer to the rela-
tive poverty threshold of about US$370 per capita per annum in 1986 prices.
E. Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
4.16      The economic rate of return (ERR) is estimated to be 18% for the
rubber replanting component which comprises 98% of total project costs (see
Table 4.5). This ERR takes into account the possibility that the cess/"grant"
system might distort the opportunity costs of senile rubber land, reduce the
incentive for new planting with farmers' own resource and encourage over-
intensive tapping to "cash in" on replanting earlier to the detriment of
sustained yield (see Annex 7).
4.17      The cost stream used in estimating the ERR includes (a) all invest-
ment and incremental operating costs (including farmer's costs) directly
attributable to rubber replanting activities during the project period and
(b) recurrent costs of agricultural inputs and ORRAF management needed post-
project to sustain project activities. Project benefits include all of the
incremental project output above a "without project" situation in which it is
assumed that ORRAF would take on no new commitments after the end of 1986.
4.18      Forecasts of yield and input requirements are made on the basis of
present levels of technology. Economic prices are calculated on the basis of
financial prices adjusted for taxes and subsidies. Prices are based on World
Bank Commodities Division forecasts and on existing domestic prices and
trends. In line with commodity forecasts, the prices of rubber and fertilizer
are projected to increase over time. The prices of Labor, planting material,
and other inputs are assumed not to change in real terms over the 32 year
period of project economic analysis. Details of che derivation of economic
prices and project cost and benefit streams.are presented in Annex 7.
4.19      Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the stability of the
ERR.  The major sensitivity tests are summarized in Table 4.5.  More detailed
tests including alternative assumptions on the opportunity cost of land within
the ORRAF replanted area are described in Annex 7. Overall, the ERR proves

stable indicating project viability under varying conditions. Rubber prices
could decrease by 15% or fertilizer and labor costs (the two major inputs)
increase by 20X and the project would still prove viable. If total project
benefits decline by 10% and all input costs increase by 10% the project ERR
would be 12.1%. Switching values calculated on the basis of the 12% cppor-
tunity cost of capital in Thailand indicate that total project benefits could
fall by up to 18% (or total costs increase by 22%) and the project would still
have a positive net present value.
F. Cost Recovery
4.20      The ORRAF "grant" presently represents about 51% of the market cost
of replanting one hectare of rubber or about 46% of the farmer's incremental
costs of replanting when income foregone is taken into account. Cost recovery
of the ORRAF "grant" can be viewed in two ways: (a) as a "pension fund" where
beneficiaries have paid into the replanting fund in the form of cess collected
during their pre-replanting years and can now draw on these payments as
pension (the "grant"); or (b) as a "loan" to be recaptured through the cess
(as rubber taxation) on future production. Under both perspectives, the ORRAF
"grant"/cess program gives good cost recovery (see Annex 7). For the former,
a typical new planter in the mid 1960s would have approximately paid for the
replanting "grant" he/she would receive starting in the late 1980s under the
project (at a discount rate of only 3%). Similarly, for the latter, the total
ORRAF "grant" cost would, on average, be more than recovered by the cess over
the life of the replant (at 12% interest). In sum, project costs would be
more than adequately recovered by taxation specific to the rubber industry.
C. Impact on Women
4.21      Women, who play a major role in agriculture in Thailand and particu-
larly in the rubber industry, represent about 50% of the population that is
actively engaged in rubber replanting activities in the South and the East.
They assist mainly in rubber tapping, latex collection, maintenance and
weeding operations, and a small percentage own and manage rubber holdings.
Women are also employed in the rubber factories, where they represent the
majority of the workforce. While no component in the project is designed
specifically to differentiate between beneficiaries by sex, the increase in
rubber replanting activities and the resulting expansion in supporting
services and industries would create substantial employment opportunities for
women in the long run.
4.22      In ORRAF, women (who are well represented at all levels) comprise
about 60% of the total staff employed at headquarters and about 20% in the.
provincial offices. There is no distinction in salaries and wages between the
sexes.
H. Environmental Impact
4.23      The project would mainly replace existing old rubber with new rub-
ber, and less than 10% of the area to be replanted would need terracing to
prevent runoff and erosion. The scattered nature of the plantings would limit
the impact of such runoff and of dissolved plant nutrients. Intercropping
would be confined to the flat and slightly undulating land to minimize risk of



- 31 -
soil erosion. No major rubber processing facilities are to be constructed;
simple rubber processing would be mainly confined to the individual holdings
or relatively small group processing centers. Fertilizers would be applied to
avoid depletion of soil nutrients. The relatively small amounts of agro-
chemicals used would have no adverse environmental effects.
I. Risk
4.24      The level of risk associated with the project is quite low.  Rubber
prices for 1986 (estimated at US$0.88/kg in constant 1984 terms for RSS 1, New
York) ranks with 1975 as the lowest level since 1940 and long term prospects
are for improvement from this cyclical low to about 1.28 constant 1984 dollars
per kg. The primary implementing agency, ORRAF, is effectively implementing a
large-scale rubber replanting program whose staff are well accepted by
farmers. Related agencies are committed to coordinating tLeir activities more
closely but continued monitoring of the proposed coordination framework would
be required.  The main project risk is the repetition of cess revenue short-
falls and the adverse impact on implementation encountered by the Second Tree
Crops Project because of lower than projected rubber prices (para. 1.11).
This prospect has been reduced by making a more conservative assumption of
cess revenues during the project period (para 3.03) and the provision for
annual reviews on the adequacy of ORRAF funding (para. 3.02).
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      A3surances were obtained from Government that:
(a) It would take the necessary steps to introduce a flat rate (Baht/kg)
cess and increase the proportion of cess revenues for ORRAF
administration costs to at least 10% by September 30, 1990
(para. 3.02).
(b) After project completion, it would provide ORRAF with the necessary
funds to bring into production ongoing rubber replantings initiated
under the project (para. 3.03).
(c) The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC), through the
issuance of a ministerial order by December 31, 1986, would confirm
(i) the extension of ORRAF's jurisdiction over the replanting
beneficiary from 5-1/2 years to 7-1/2 years and (ii) the allocation
of responsibilities for extension, training and demonstration
(para. 3.08).
(d) The National Rubber Policy Committee (NRPC) would:
(i) establish by December 31, 1986 and maintain the three Technical
Subcommittees (para. 3.07);
(ii)  establish 1y December 31, 1986 and maintain the task force

THIRD RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
Rubber Area and the Appropriate Replanting Rate
Introduction
1.        Rubber has a number of characteristics which make it suitable as a
smallholder crop in Thailand: it is tolerant of a wide range of soil and
other conditions; it has high value in relation to its weight; processing (in
the form of unsmoked sheets) at the farm level is 3imple and requires low
technology and the product does not deteriorate seriously in transit. Rubber
has thus become the most important crop on the upland soils in the high rain-
fall areas of the south. This annex reviews the existing information on the
area under various types of rubber, the trend in rubber area expansion and
analyses the appropriateness of ORRAF's target area for replanting.
Area Trends and Replanting Requirements
2.        Rubber has been grown in Thailand since the turn of the century.
While it is clear that the quantity of rubber has expanded substantially, the
precise area under rubber in Thailand and the rates of planting are not known
with much degree of accuracy. There is no reasonable mechanism in Thailand
for estimating annual new plantings; however, a series of estimates of total
ubberl7rea have been made and planting rates can be derived from these as
shown:-

For the last 35 years, the expansion of area under rubber has been about
3.6% p.a. The rate, since 1966, has been progressively slower as readily
accessible land has diminished and replanting has greatly expanded.

/a   Consisting of all rubber planted after 1966.
The estimated 1984 production of 658,000 tons (600,000 ton exports, plus
45,000 tons domestically processed and perhaps 13,000 tons per year smuggled)
is reasonably consistent with this (see Annex 2).
4.        Prior to 1960, very little replanting had taken place.  Since then
the ORRAF program has been in effect and replanting, under that program had by
the end of 1983 amounted to a cumulative total of about 488,000 ha. Assuming
a 25 year cycle, all rubber planted through 1958 would be senile after 1983.
Estimated rubber in 1958 is 920,000 ha. If 480,000 ha of ORRAF replanting,
and say a further 60,000 ha of privately financed replantings are deducted
from this, a backlog of 380,000 ha of senile rubber remains in need of
replanting at the end of 1983.
5.        In order to show the impact of the ORRAF program on the long-term
structure of the national rubber plantation, a simple model has been construc-
ted, based on the area survey data discussed in para. 2. The following
results (based on a 25 year replacement cycle) were obtaired:

/a   Figures in parentheses show the effect of an expanded ORRAF's program
(90,000 ha/year) from 1999.
New senile rubber area will be added at a lower rate until the end of the
century to about 215,000 ha but, would (once again) increase because of the
impact of ORRAF replanting since the mid 1970s. Even if the replanting
program were to be expanded at the end of the century to 90,000 ha/year, a
substantial backlog of senile trees would remain.
6.        In order to plan more effectively for the long run, however, better
data needs to be collected on:
(a) the present area of senile rubber; and
(b) the proportion of old senile rubber and of rubber shortly to become
senile which, for some reason or other, will not come up for
replant ing.
Answers to (a) could be arrived at quite objectively through a combination of
photo interpretation and suitable ground surveys. To arrive at (b), however,
would be more complex and would depend on both the socio-economic conditions
of the smallholders and, perhaps more importantly, on the legal rights of
those operators of rubber holdings who do not have fuli title.
7.        Without a much clearer answer to the above it is difficult to be
confident that the present ORRAF replanting rate is the best one. However, we
can be sure that, provided farmers are not legally prevented from replanting
(e.g. due to title problems in cropped forest reserves), it is not too big
from the viewpoint of the backlog of senile trees available for replanting
support.

THIRD RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
Rubber Cultivation and Production -
Rubber Production
1.        Over 80% of Thailand's rubber is grown in peninsular Thailand where
it is the principal crop. Rubber cultivation spread to the East in the early
1970s; test plantings in the North and Northeast have only recently been esta-
blished, but preliminary indications are that growth exceeds expectations.
Over the past decade, rubber exports grew at a rate of about 5.2% p.a. from
about 356 thousand metric tons (1973-75) to about 566 thousand metric tons
(1982-84) annually. In 1984, rubber exports were about 600 thousand tons
valued at over U$520 million (Table 1). Rubber together with rice, cassava
and sugarcane form the most important foreign exchange earners in the
agricultural sector. With an expected upturn in prices, rubber could well
become the lead foreign exchange earning crop.
2.        Over 90% of the rubber is grown by smallholders with holdings of
8 ha or less. In the past, unselected seedlings with low yields potential
were planted, inputs were hardly used and tapping was done daily. Processing,
carried out at the farm, resulted in low grade rubber fetching relatively low
prices. However, with the introduction of the ORRAF rubber replanting program
in 1960, and particularly the expansion under World Bank financing since 1976,
modern technology has been increasingly adopted. High yielding clonal plant
material, use of fertilizers during immaturity and correct husbandry practices
have led to nearly a doubling in rubber exports from proportionately less
planted area than in the last decade. Improvement in processing and
marketing, partly through Group Marketing Organizations, have resulted in the
production of better quality sheets for the smaller farmers. Ribbed smoked
sheet (RSS) rubber comprised 86% of all types of rubber exported in 1984. Of
this, RSS 3 accounted for 66% and RSS 1-2 for 11%. Despite the fact that RSS
grades 4-5 are still significant (at 23%), there has been a small shift
towards higher grades (RSS 1-3) in the past decade. Thai technical rubbers
(TTRs) now account for 13%, and other natural rubber (crepe and 3crap) only
for 6Z of total rubber exports (Table 1). The high proportion of scrap rubber
exports has been drastically reduced since 1974 due to block rubber processing
expansion (Table 1).
3.        Latest estimates (1984) place Thailand's total rubber area at about
1.6 million ha, distributed as follows:

4.        Samllholders Incomes.  A recent survey (1982/83) of about 1,000
rubber farmers indicates that average gross family income for the median
farmer operating a holding of 4 ha (with about 2 ha under rubber) ranges from
about B 34,000 to B 58,000 depending on the stage of maturity of the rubber
stand. About 50Z of this is farm income with the rest from off-farm
sources. Net per capita income (family of 6-7 members) ranges from B 5,250 to
B 8,600. Farm expenses average B 8,100. About 60Z of agricultural income is
derived from rubber sales, 7Z from annual crops, 17Z from other perennial
crops and t  remaining 16X from livestock and other agricultural
activities.-
5.        Most ORRAF replanters (70Z) have holdings varying from 2 to 10 ha.
Per capita incomes for the saller farmers (those with 2 ha and below range
between baht 5,100 to baht 8,600). Rubber producers who have not received
ORRAF assistance typically have similar levels of family incomes, but a recent
survey indicates that the proportion of their agricultural income derived from
rubber is about 53Z, compared to 73Z for ORRAF participants with mature rubber
stands.
6.        Technical Specifications    - Nurseries. About 25Z of clonal
planting m45erial requirements is provided by ORRAF, 25Z private field
nurseries _ in the form of bare root budded or polybag budded stumps, and 50Z

non-ORRAF beneficiaries. For details, see Working Paper No. 3, Project
File.
3/ The standards given would be maintained for both the rubber replanting
and new planting programs.
4/   Private nurseries are owned and operated by estates and smallbolders who
produce plant material under contract arrangements with ORRAF.

is from farmer cooperatives, either as budding stumps or seed at stake
followed by field budding. Quality of plant material is assured through
Rubber Research Institute (RRIT) certification; RRIT inspectors twice yearly
inspect all nurseries and remove plants not true to label.
7.        Land Preparation.  About 8OZ of land clearing is done by hand,
occasionally resulting in labor shortages, delays in field operations and in
incomplete planting programs. To accelerate land clearing operations, replan-
rers individually or in groups either purchase chainsaws or contract felling
operations to chainsaw gangs at a cost of about $62.50/ha (B 200/rai).
Terracing is needed over about 10% of the area. Rubber planting is done in
the rainy seasons of May-July or October/November each year.
8.        Planting.  The project would promote the use of new clones, includ-
ing PR255, PR261, PB235, PB255, PB260 and PB217. Farmers are less interested
in GTl, from which the initial yields tend to be low. RRIM 600 continues to
be the preferred clone, still over 50%, because of its reliability and
yield. The selected high-yielding clonal plant material would be planted
either as seed at stake followed by field budding, budded stumps or polybag
budded stumps, the latter being preferred for its vigorous growth and shorter
immaturity period.
9.        Planting would be done at a density of 500 trees/ha spaced at
3.0 x 6.7 m or 3.5 x 5.7 m on flat and undulating land. The latter spacing
would ensure that the canopy would close in about 3-4 years, resulting in the
shading out of weeds and a reduction in maintenance cost. At this density,
approximately 450 trees/ha (72/rai) is assumed to be tappable at maturity (six
years for polybag budded stumps, 6.5 years for budded stumps and seven years
for seed at stake plantings, when full inputs, especially fertilizers, are
provided). Assuming a task of about 600 trees per tapping day and the
adoption of alternate daily tapping, one labor unit could exploit about 3 ha
of planted rubber, with some assistance from other family members. For small
rubber holdings of below 15 rai, plant density may be increased to 600 trees
per hectare, to allow for sustainable tapping intensities.
10.       Intercropping.  About 70Z of the smallholders intercrop their rubber
stands with annual or short-term perennial crops during the first two years.
Intercropping is encouraged wherever the terrain and soil conditions are
suitable as it provides the farmer with extra income during the period of
immatuzity. At the end of onc or two years in the intercropped areas, or from
the outset in all other replanted areas, a leguminous cover crop is
established by about 30% of the smallholders. Cover crop seeds are readily
available.
11.       Maintenance aad Tapping.  Under the replanting program, maintenance
is routine and consists mainly of timely applications of fertilizer, weeding,
and disease control under the guidance of ORRAF inspectors who ensure that
planters and replanters qualify for grant payments. The major disease,
present mainly in the western part of Southern Thailand, is Phytophthora
botryosa leaf disease; in addition, Phytophthora spp cause black stripe panel



- 39 -                            ANNEX 2
Page 4
disease. The most effective preventive measure is to plant disease-tolerant
clones. Labor requirements to undertake maintenance is given in Table 2.
Fertilizer is applied at the time of planting, i.e., 125 gm (63 kg/ha) rock
phosphate placed in the planting hole. After planting, mixed fertilizers are
applied at regular intervals and at rates agreed with RRIT (see Table 2).
Under the project, with extended ORRAF jurisdiction, an additional application
of 325 kg/ha of compound fertilizer will be given to boost girthing prior to
commencement of tapping.  Fertilizer application in the mature phase is recom-
mended only after three years from initial tapping. The project assumes
however, that only about 20% of the rubber replanters would continue ferti-
lizer apglications during maturity and adopt the less intensive tapping system
(S2/d2)._   The value of fertilizers and other material assistance provided
under the replanting program is given in Tables 2 and 3. Tapping standards
are satisfactory but abut 40% of replanters are estimated to be tapping at S/3
d/l (133Z tapping intensity) compared to the approximately 15% presently
following the official (RRIT) recommendation (S2/d2). The remaining 45% of
replanters tap S3 2d/3 (89% intensity) and S/3 3d/4 (100%). Summary yield
assumptions for the main tapping systems are presented in Table 4.
12.       Processing and Marketing.  The main requirement in the production of
high quality sheet rubber is cleanliness during tapping, collection and
processing.  The technique is straightforward and well understood by sma'L-
holders. Trees are tapped in the morning, and one tapper would be able to
tap, collect and process latex into wet sheet from an area of 1.2 ha in a six
hour working period, many starting to tap as early as 3:00 am. Most of the
unsmoked sheet produced will concinue to be marketed through existing
marketing channels which function efficiently. Many local group marketing
organization have been formed. Those that have become well established are
effective in improving both the quality of rubber produced and the returns to
the farmer members.
13.       About 90X of the rubber in South Thailand is processed by the small-
holders into ribbed unsmoked sheet (wet sheet). Except in the case of scrap
rubbers the present premium for block rubber over ribbed smoked sheets does
not cover the additional investment and processing costs of conversion from
unsmoked sheet into block rubber. The unsmoked sheet is sold to small village
traders or through group marketing centers, to large dealers who process the
rubber and export it as Ribbed Smoked Sheet (RSS) grades 3 and 4. Several
independent marketing studies have shown that farmers obtain fair prices for
their rubber produced at CMOs, representing 80-90% of f.o.b. prices net of
taxes.
14.       High Level Tapping with Stimulation (HLTs).  In the three to five
years preceeding replanting, it would be feasible to maximize returns from
low-yielding rubber stands through high level tapping with stimulation,
followed by slaughter tapping. Since smallholders generally replant their
51   Tapping methods are expressed in terms of cut -- S/2 (half spiral) or S/3
(one-third spiral) and frequency of tapping - dJ2 (alternate daily), 2d/3
(every two out of three days).



- 40 -                                   2
Page 5
rubber holdings in stages, the additonal income derived from HLTs could lessen
the burden of decreased income during replanting when only part of the
holdings is productive. The experience of an EEC project, assisting RRIT in
promoting HLTs to smallholders, shows that intensive promotion, careful pre-
selection of participants and proper training is critical for success and
future promotion and support should be undertaken by the Department of
Agricultural Extension.

THIRD RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
Organizational Structure and Functions of Project Institutions
The Office of the Rubber Replanting Aid Fund (ORRAF)I/
1.        ORRAF, established by the Rubber Replanting Aid Fund Act, B.E. 2503
(1960), is responsible for administering a program for replanting old, low-
yielding or abandoned rubber areas, with high yielding clonal varieties.
ORRAF provides technical assistance (in directing farmers on land clearing,
planting and proper and timely use of inputs); makes available the necessary
inputs (high yielding clones, fertilizers and agro-chemicals); and provides
financial assistance (in terms of cash payment for farmers' labor).
2.        ORRAF is governed by a Board, whose Chairman is the Minister of
Agriculture but, in practice, is represented by the Permanent Secretary of
HOAC. The Board consists of 15 members including the Director of ORRAF and
representatives of the Ministries of Interior, Commerce, Industry, Finance and
MOAC, the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB), the Bureau
of the Budget (BOB), the Rubber Research Institute (RRIT), the Fiscal Policy
Office (FPO) of the Ministry of Finance, a rubber farmer representative and a
few rubber specialists. Board members are appointed by the Council of
Ministers for two-year terms. The Board, in its monthly meetings, sets
policy, approves structural and procedural changes, key staff appointments,
and annual programs and budgets. The Board also formally approves replanting
applications. The Director, appointed by the Board, is the Chief Executive.
He is assisted by two Deputy Directors, one for finance and administration and
one for operations. At the Head Office in Bangkok, there are four main
departments, administration, finance, replanting and development, and four
staff agencies, including the office of the Director, internal audit, planning
and monitoring, and computer center. Details of ORRAF's central
organizational structure are shown in Figure 1.
3.        About 78Z of ORRAF's 2,200 staff members work in 12 Provincial
offices (10 located in the South and 2 in the East near the Cambodian border)
with 36 branches at the district level (Figure 2). These field offices
administer grant payments through local banks, supervise replantings and
provide extension services. During the past five years, there have been
efforts to reorganize ORRAF along the lines recommended by an external
consulting firm financed under Loan 1243-TH.
4.        ORRAF has three sources of funds:  the rubber cess; interest income
on deposits; and subventions from Government which include Bank and CDC
loans. (See Annex 8 for a further description of ORRAF's finances.) Staff
1/   Details are in Working Paper No. 4.  ORRAF's finances are discussed in
Annex 8.

remuneration compares favorably with Civil Service standards, and this, plus
the flexibility provided by promotions and transfers, has helped greatly in
the recruitme.  and retention of high quality staff.  The size and distribu-
tion of the staff are adequate to carry out ongoing programs successfully.
5.        The training programs offered by ORRAF, both for its own staff and
for the rubber replanters are good. Regular technical training programs are
offered to development and extension staff involved in field operations, while
courses in management and administration are aimed at staff at headquarters
and in the provincial offices. Overseas scholarships and study and observa-
tion tours have also been offered to qualified staff, with financing from
UNDP.
6.        Overall, ORRAF organization and management is quite satisfactory.
Areas of possible improvement pertains to (a) improving cost effectiveness;
(b) the improvement of planning and monitoring of the replanting program; and
(c) a clearer role for the Planning and Monitoring Unit of ORRAF.
The Rubber Research Institute of Thailand (RRIT)
7.        RRIT of the Department of Agriculture (DOA), Ministry of Agriculture
and Cooperatives (MOAC) is responsible for research in the rubber sector.
RRIT was created in 1983, replacing the previous Rubber Division of MOAC.
Thailand's program of research in rubber cultivation, production and process-
ing largely dates from the establishment of the Rubber Research Center (RRC)
in Songkla Province at Hat Yai in 1965.
8.        RRIT is responsible for research, control of production and
distribution of rubber; enforcement of the Rubber Control Act B.E. 2481
(1938); coordination of activities in compliance with the Rubber Replanting
Aid Fund Act B.E. 2503 (1960); and the Government Rubber Estate's Founding
Decree B.E. 2504 (1961). RRIT's objectives are to improve productivity of the
rubber sector and the quality of rubber produced; provide a technical training
service; collaborate with international organizations concerned with natural
rubber; and act as the principal agency for coordinating government policies
in the rubber sector. RRIT is also the national regulatory body for the Thai
Tested Rubber (TTR) scheme and it carries out specification testing for block
rubber, while supervising the testing laboratories of private manufactures of
TTR rubber.
9.        The organizational structure of RRIT is given in Figures 3 and 4.
RRIT is one of six research institutes in the Department of Agriculture. It
is headed by a Director (responsible to the Director General, DOA) assisted by
two Deputy Director's responsible for administrative and technical activities
respectively. RRIT is based in Bangkok where the office is divided into four
subdivisions, covering: Administration; Monitoring and Evaluation; the Rubber
Control Act; and Training. The Director is advised by a technical group
including specialists in agronomy, rubber technology, marketing and
economics. RRIT has nearly 1,600 staff of which 442 are professional
(university or diploma graduates).



- 47 -                            ANNEX 3
Page 3
10.       In addition to the long established Songkla RRC, RRIT is responsible
for two recently instituted RRCs at Surat Thani and Chacheongsao. These
centers cover the area under rubber in Thailand as follows:
(a) Songkla RRC
(i) Lower South - the seven southernmost provinces lying
approximately south of the 8°N latitude line.
(b) Surat Thani RRC
(i) Peninsular East Coast - the eastern provinces of the isthmus
north of the 8° latitude line influenced by the Gulf of
Thailand;
(ii) Peninsular West Coast - the Western provinces influenced by the
Indian Ocean.
(c) Chachoengsao RRC
(i) East - the provinces of the Eastern and Northeastern regions of
Thai land.
11.       Research activities to date, largely at the Songkla RRC, have been
directed at the following:
(a) increasing yields by breeding or introduction of high-yielding
clones; by application of fertilizer; disease control; by improved
tapping and stimulation techniques; or by innovations in crop
husbandry practices (e.g., pruning, weeding);
(b) reduction in the immature period of the rubber tree, both by the
development of faster maturing clones and improved husbandry,
including the use of older planting material (e.g. advanced planting
material in polybags rather than bare root budded stumps).
(c) improvement of the economics of production, transport, processing,
marketing and export of natural rubber; and
(d) technical development of vazious aspects of rubber processing.
In addition to these main research themes, RRIT also experiments with differ-
ent cover crops and intercrops, and soil conservation techniques.
12.       RRIT is financed from four sources:  (a) government budget subven-
tions; {b) 5% of rubber export cess receipts; (c) withdrawals from the RRIT
revolving fund (which receives income from the Institute's stations, such as
from rubber production and sale of planting material); and (d) grant support
from the EEC. The Department of Agriculture (DOA) is also being assisted by a
World Bank Loan (1922-TH) from 1981-86, which inter alia, upgrades the
research institutes.

13.       Proposed project support, therefore, fills a gap in the assistance
of DOA's research institutes. It wil' be focussed on supporting the emphasis,
already begun for the non-tree crop subsectors, in undertaking research that
would be more relevant to the varied agro-ecological and economic conditions in
Thailand.
The Department of Agricultural Extension
14.       The DOAE provides extension services for most agricultural crops in
Thailand. In the rubber subsector, it presently assumes extension responsi-
bilities for participants after 5½ years in the replanting program. It is
also responsible for the extension of newly planted rubber. The increased
focus and allocation of specific staff for rubber extension has, however, been
quite recent.
15.       The organizational structure of DOAE is given in Figure 5.  DOAE,
with about 2,500 professional staff, is headed by a Director General, who is
assisted by two deputies. The department is divided at the headquarters level
into nine divisions with extension, technical and administrative responsibil-
ities. One Deputy Director General is responsible for four administrative and
extension divisions and the other for five technical divisions.
16.       In the extension (field) service, the Regional Extension Officer
(REO) coordinates the work of the Provincial Extension Officers (PEOs) in his
region and is directly responsible for certain specialized services admin-
istered from the regional headquarters. His staff consists of Subject Matter
Specialists (SMSs) %ho train and backstop provincial staff. The PEOs super-
vise District ELtension Officers (DEOs) who in turn are responsible, at the
sub-district level, for village extension agents (VEAs) who work with contact
farmers and farmers' groups (see Figure 6). Provincial administrators
occasionally become involved in extension matters since major decisions on
agricultural extension policy and financing are cleared with the Governor at
the provincial level and the District Administrator (Nai Amphur) at the
district level. Extension budgets are prepared by DOE and funds are made
available to the PEOs through the Governors at four-monthly intervals.
17.       Rubber support in DOAE takes place through the field extension ser-
vice via two avenues: (a) the "training and visits" (T&V) system undertaken
through the PEOs/CEOs/VEAs; and (b) specialized support (through rubber
advisory officers from the Rubber Subdivision of the Crop Promotion Division)
posted at the regional headquarters under the REOs. The rubber growing areas
have lagged behind other parts of the country in terms of being staffed with
the requisite field extension officers. Six of the twelve rubber growing
provinces do not, as yet, have PEOs; and, in the major rubber growing
provinces, the allocation of one VEA to 1,000 farmers only took effect in
1983/84. Given the staffing situation and the fact that tree crop extension
work is still at its infancy (lobg gestation crop support is quite different
from the, hitherto, annual crop emphasis), it is, therefore, not surprising
that, field extension service for rubber has generally not been very effective
(see Working Paper No. 6 for details). Institutional strengthening,
coordinated programs (with ORRAF and RRIT) and a more focussed targeting of
farmers are critical.

THIRD RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
Coordination of Technical Support Services for Rubber Development
Background
1.        Because of the long gestation nature of the crop, and the fact that
improper husbandry in the early years could undermine crop yield much later,
the transfer of improved technology to the rubber farmer requires different
intensities of support during the life cycle of the rubber tree. The most
critical are husbandry and input use during the immature period and the start
of tapping (especially its timing and system used). Once actions are
comitted, the long-term effects are determined.
2.        At present, ORRAF's assistance to smallholders is restricted to the
first 5½ years after replanting, after which DOAE is responsible for technical
advice. 17ith handover to DOAE before maturity, a high incidence of early
tapping - and improper tapping practices occur with adverse effect on
yields. The DOAE, despite improved staffing, has not been effective in
countering these problems. The widespread (all crops) extension coverage and
the annual crop bias in extension techniques under DOAE's "training and
visits" (T&V) system is one reason; a rubber focused approach (cognizant of
the long gestation impact) with greater interagency collaboration is needed.
However, better extension services may not resolve the problem because the
pressure on smallholders to realize income may be an offsetting factor. If
ORRAF (with its enforced discipline) extends its support to replanters from 5½
to 7½ years, it would help to prevent premature tapping and permit one more
round of fertilizer. DOAE could then focus its attention more productively on
smallholders "graduating" from the replanting program so that, at maturity,
proper panel opening and tapping systems can be adopted. These measures would
improve productivity and income in the long term.
3.        In terms of other effective technical support, new yield enhancing
techniques are available, some of which need further adaptive research. Of
these, the following are particularly promising: (a) high level tapping with
yield stimulation (HLTS) for old, low yielding rubber trees prior to replant-
ing; (b) identification and treatment of tapping panel diseases; (c) differ-
ential husbandry and tapping systems for wetter or drier than normal rubber
areas; and (d) improved on-farm processing of ribbed unsmoked rubber sheets.
These technologies should be adapted to smallholder conditions and, where
appropriate, extended through ORRAF, DOAE and RRIT coordination.
1/   An RRIT study recently found that nearly 50% of replanters sampled
initiated tapping at an average girth of 44 cm instead of the recommended
girth of 50 cm.

Page 2
4.        Present coordination, through a Technical Committee chaired by the
Director of ORRAF (with representatives from RRIT, DOAE and UNDP as members)
does not have the mandate and interministerial power to enforce implementation
of its findings and recommendations. Technical coordination in rubber
production and development can be more effective if it were directly linked to
the National Rubber Policy Committee (NRPC). NRPC is chaired by the Deputy
Minister, MOAC with the Deputy Ministers of Commerce and Finance serving as
Vice-Chairmen. The Secretary is the Director of Projects Div., Office of the
Permanent Secretary, MOAC. Other members include: the Permanent Secretaries
of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce; Directors General/Secretarys General of
DOA, DOAE, Office of Board of Investment, Department of Economics Affairs
(Ministry of Foreign Affairs); Director, RRIT; representatives of BOB; and
selected rubber specialists and private sector representatives. The NRPC has
recently established three technical subcommittees which have an interminis-
terial manaate. The Government will be providing the Bank with details on
these subcommittees shortly. The function of these subcommittees would be to
resolve technical issues in the rubber subs,..ctor including subjects like: the
technical justification of various rubber programs; responsibilities for the
sale and purchase of planting material; the development of rubber products;
and technical recommendations (e.g., appropriate clones, fertilizers) for
smallholders. Members of the subcommittees could comprise: the Directors-
General or equivalent (or their representatives) of DOAE, ORRAF, OAE, DOA; and
the rubber specialists and private sector members of NRPC.
5.        The subcommittees would be necessary to ensure periodic review of
key areas of continual concern for the NRPC. The rationale, composition and
framework of coordination are discussed below for the following three critical
areas: (a) planting materials; (b) extension, training and demonstration in
rubber production; and (c) rubber statistics.
Planting Materials
6.        Because planting materials need a gestation period of almost two
years before supply can be made available, it is important to monitor the
supply and demand status for budwood and budded stumps at least two years
ahead of actual requirement. The need for monitoring is now critical because,
in addition to the "traditional" rubber growing/support agencies like ORRAF,
RRIT, DOAE, Rubber Estates Organization (REO) and the Public Welfare
Department (PWD), other agencies like the Agricultural Land Reform Office
(ALRO), the Royal Forestry Department (RFD), the Forest Industries Organiza-
tion (FIO) and Cooperative Promotion Department (CPD) have recently been
increasingly involved in rubber growing. Also, the private sector is now the
foremost supplier of planting materials in the country and their market
concentration has also increased in a number of sreas.
7.        A Subcommittee on Planting Materials is, therefore, needed to:
(a) estimate and update, every six months, the requirements of various
types of planting materials by government agencies, by location and
period needed. Such estimates should be on a "rolling" three-year
plan basis;



- 70 -
ANNME 5
Page 3
(b) assess the supply capability of both gover nent (primarily RRIT and
ORRAF) and private sector (private nurseries and farmer
cooperatives), by location, on a rolling three-year basis;
(c)  determine, through RRIT/DOAE monitoring at selected locations, the
prices of planting materials to prevent market abuse and price
fixing practices by private sellers; and
(d) assess (i) the special needs and difficulties for supplying new
clones being introduced by RRIT; and (ii) the needs in new planting
areas.
8.        The Chairman of the Subcommittee should be the Director of ORRAF
(the principal purchaser of planting materials). RRIT, with responsibility
for registering and inspecting private nurseries, could serve as the Secretary
to the Working Group. The members could include representatives from DOAE,
REO and the larger planting material consumers among the other government
agencies (para. 3). Representatives from large nurseries and farmers'
cooperatives should also be members.
Extension and Training
9.        Since husbandry and input use in the immature period and the adop-
tion of appropriate tapping systems are critical for the innate yield capabi-
lity of the rubber tree, extension and demonstration efforts should be timely
focused. Progress has been made in defining the responsibilities of ORRAF,
DOAE and RRIT as follows:
(a) ORRAF would continue the training it undertakes for the pretapping
(development) phase of the beneficiaries' rubber plot.
(b) RRIT would be responsible for training the trainers (from DOAE or
ORRAF) and for undertaking replanter skills acquisition training
(e.g., "hands on" training like how to tap or bud properly).
(c) DOAE would be responsible for knowledge acquisition training for
graduating replanters (e.g., when to initiate tapping and what
tapping systems are best suited for their particular situations) and
extension during the mature period.
10.       While continued strengthening of ORRAF's training and the skill
acquisition training (through RRIT) are important activities for the project,
a new training program for graduating replanters (to be set up under DOA) is a
necessity. Instead of its present widespread coverage over two days, it
should be focused on: convincing graduating replanters (especially the first
timer) on the use of appropriate tapping systems; how to initiate tapping
properly; requirements for reducing the incidence of tapping panel disease;
and improved processing and group marketing. After the joint selection and
scheduling of graduating farmers (by DOAE and ORRAF at the provincial level),
training through DOAE mobile units (supported under the proposed project) will
be undertaken at the subdistrict level before tapping is initiated. If deemed
necessary, existing ORRAF mobile units could adjust their schedules to support
the program.



- 71 -
ANNEX 5
Page 4
11.       The above initiatives constitute an important start.  However,
improvemernt in the quality and content of training requires a reexamination of
the training needs of the various agencies and the most effective means for
accommodating the needs. Furthermore, as more agencies (like ALRO, CPD and
PWD) become involved in rubber production, greater extension support and
training will be required. Their needs should also be taken into account.
12.       A Subcommittee on Extension and Training is, therefo e, needed to
assess for different categories of farmers and key agencies, the requirements
for training and the emphasis (subject matter) which would likely bring about
the greatest benefit. Consideration could specifically be given to:
(a)  selection of promising adaptive research results which can be trans-
ferred to the farmer (and how that might be done);
(b)  inventory of support agencies extension and training needs (includ-
ing timing) and how they could be accommodated;
(c)  the appropriate approach in demonstration techniques which, unlike
annual crops, give rise to results which are often obvious years
after the action has been taken;
(d) reassessing the need for a periodic visits system (T&V system) for
mature rubber; and
(e)  the relevance of various skill acquisition training for various
parts of the rubber growing areas (e.g., is tapping skills training
needed in well-developed rubber areas?).
1-.       The Chairman of the Subcommittee for Extension and Training should
be DOAE.  Other members should include ORRAF, RRIT and, perhaps, DTEC.
Rubber Statistics
14.       To assist in the planning and monitoring of the Rubber subsector,
improved statistics are particularly important for: (a) estimating and pro-
jecting production and exports so that accurate assessment of future cess and
export tax revenues can be obtained; (b) assessing the extent and location of
future areas where the demand for replanting assistance will be concentrated;
(c) providing the basis for selecting target areas for the Needy Rubber Small-
holder Development Program (see Annex 6).
15.       In terms of achieving the above, three types of surveys are needed:
(a)  Base line area surveys based on aerial photography, satellite
imagery and selected ground verification to identify the extent and
location of immature and mature rubber areas at the district/sub-
district level.
(b)  Monitoring surveys based on stratified sampling of farmers in the
main types of rubber growing areas to assess the rate of area expan-
sion (year-to-year), the changing composition of age structure of



- 72 -
ANNEX 5
Page 5
trees, the extent of clonal area expansion and area still remaining
under seedling rubber. Estimates of gross production could also be
made but a more accurate assessment can only result from properly
undertaken yield surveys (see below).
(c) Annual yield surveys, based on monitoring in selected months, can
provide more accurate and early production assessments if it is
properly sampled (as a subsample of (b)). It can be used to explain
differences in production due to differences in weather effects,
types of clones and incidence of diseases which need to be quickly
controlled before they become a major problem (e.g., various bark
panel diseases).
16.       At present the agencies concerned with rubber production statistics
(RRIT, OAE, DOAE and ORRAF) collect the information for their own specific
needs. Because of their different approaches (e.g., yield surveys done by
RRIT are not related to any properly sampled area assessments) and limited
resources, the information collected cannot be used for the purposes outlined
above. Agreement has been reached by OAE, RRIT, DOAE and ORRAF to coordinate
the collection of rubber statistics as follows:
(a) Base line surveys would continue to be undertaken by RRIT in
conjunction with the universities. These surveys should be
undertaken once in about three to five years.
(b) Monitoring surveys would be undertaken by OAE jointly with DOAE. As
part of a joint program for five crops, substantial progress has
already been made for rubber in the 10% sampling frame, the required
questionnaire and the initial training of DOAE staff. Support to
ensure the success of this activity is very important. The results
would enable more effective monitoring of year-to-year area and
production changes.
(c) The yield surveys under RRIT will continue, but, after the first
year's assessment of the OAE/DOAE monitoring surveys, they will be
undertaken in a subsample established under the monitoring surveys
so that bias in aggregation (to estimate production) can be
eliminated.
17.       The composition and responsibilities of the Subcommittee for Rubber
Statistics (to meet every six months) should be as follows:
(a)  RRIT  - preseitly responsible for Rubber statistics would chair the
Subc mmittee. It would have primary responsibility for the
base line surveys, the yield surveys and the compilation of
wholesale price and trade data. It would ensure that deci-
sions of the Subcommittee are reflected in the data/informa-
tion released for public use.
(b)  OAE   - the Center for Agricultural Statistics would have primary
responsibility for the monitoring surveys and monitoring of
farm level prices. It will use the results of the Sub-
committee for its publication on Agricultural Statistics.



- 73 -
ANNEX 5
Page 6
(c) DWAE - will jointly undertake the monitoring survey with OAE.
Since it is also responsible for registering farmers new
plantings, it will provide estimates of annual new plantings
(by types of clones) to provide a consistency check on the
monitoring surveys. DOAE's district level estimates of area
and age composition of trees will be another source of
check.
(d) ORRAF - will provide information on areas replanted, by locality,
and types of clones used.
The results of this Subcommittee's deliberations will also be presented to the
Subcommittee to Review Agricultural Statistics, MOAC.

THIRD RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
The Needy Rubber Smallholders Development Program (NRSDP)
1.        The area under rubber production in Thailand has increased at a rate
of 1.4Z p.a. from about 1.2 million ha in 1967 to 1.6 million ha in 1984. The
Rubber Replanting Program has increased at an even faster rate of 17.6% p.a.
(from 33 thousand ha to 528 thousand ha) in the same period. While the
replanting Program has been widely dispersed geographically in the rubber
growing Tyeas, the beneficiaries have been primarily average sized
farmers.-' A large proportion of needy farmers have been left out, many of
whom cannot afford even to take advantage of the replanting "grant." ORRAF,
in its field surveys, has identified the following characteristics of needy
farmers and prospects for helping them (see Working Paper No. 3):
(a) Farmers with smaller rubber holdings usually have smaller total
holding size.
(b) Holding size of rubber farmers are directly correlated to total farm
family income although the smaller farmer tends to rely proportion-
ately more on nonfarm income.
(c) Little improvement can be derived from helping farmers with a rubber
holding of less than a one tapping labor task (about 1 ha) in size.
(d) Substantial opportunities, however, exist for the smaller/needy
farmers to farm more economically by extending their small rubber
plots with #4jacent plots, presently not eligible for replanting
assistance.,
These results provide a useful background for devising programs to identify
and assist the needy rubber smallholder.
2.        As expansion of area replanted is now no longer the primary objec-
tive of the replanting program (target area aided by ORRAF each year is
constant at 50,000 ha), ORRAF is now in a better position to help the more
needy rubber farmers. While needy rubber farmers may be found in all rubber
growing districts, because of limited resources, assistance cannot be
1/   According to the ORRAF/NIDA 1982183 socioeconomic survey, about 42% of
ORRAF replanters (both ongoing and terminated) farm between 10-25 rai of
rubber. About 11Z of rubber farmers have rubber holdings of less than
5 rai and nearly 32X less than 10 rai (See Working Paper No.3).
2/ The ORRAF/NIDA survey also found that potential beneficiaries (the Non-
ORRAF farmer) tended to have a higher percentage of unused land in their
holdings (see Working Paper No. 3).



- 75 -                             ANNEX 6
Page 2
scattered and a coordinated effort among key government agencies to provide
complementary support would be essential. The need is, therefore, to esta-
blish criteria to select the target districts in rubber growing areas for
focussing support services. ORRAF, DOAE, RRIT, OAE and BAAC, have tentatively
agreed that the selection of needy rubber smallholder districts would be based
on district level information (on relative holding size, income and poverty)
obtained from: (a) the 1978 Agricultural Census; (b) Ministry of Health
statistics on subsistence households; and (c) the rubber statistics survey
currently being undertaken jointly by OAE and DOAE. It is expected that all
districtslsubdistricts in the Poverty Area Development Program would be
included in the selected target areas.
3.        In the target areas selected, the effort would be to help all rubber
farmers because improvement in productivity of the larger farmers would pro-
vide employment (e,g, as hired tappers) for needy farmers in the locality.
Although it would be directed to replanters, the proposed Needy Rubber Small-
holder Develov7ent Program (NRSDP) could eventually cover both replanting and
new planting._
4.        The efforts and emphases for NRSDP would be as follows:
(a) ORRAF has agreed, on a countrywide basis, to:
-    modify its application questionnaires to permit better target
farmer selection;
-    set field staff performance targets and incentives based on the
numbers of beneficiaries rather than the total area to be
reached;
-    permit needy farmers with replantable rubber of less than 7 rai
(one task size) to receive aid for consolidating their replant-
ing plots with adjoining nonrubber plots to make up 7 rai;
-    identify and refer potential replanting beneficiaries in need
of credit to BAAC for assistance (including subsistence loans)
and act as guarantor for short-/medium-term loans (through the
use of cash payments due to the replanter) where necessary.
(b) DOAE has agreed to locate its group processing/marketing centers
under the project (see Working Paper No. 6) in the designated rubber
small farmer districtstsubdistricts. From past experience, a
greater proportion of smaller farmers can be assisted only if
emphasis is given to: (i) "spinning-off" processing subgroups from
established GPMCs as initial groups tend to comprise average sized
or larger farmers; and (ii) establishing a revolving fund to advance
3/   For instance, the framework of assistance developed can be incorporated
into the rubber new planting support envisaged by the EEC (to promote
diversification from cassava).



-76 -                            ANNEX 6
Page 3
poor farmers the monies they need fo  their daily spending since
they cannot afford to wait for the weekly/biweekly marketing days to
get payment. Demonstrations for lLT with stimulation will also be
associated with these centers in the target areas.
(c) MOAC would reorient its supplementary assistance 4from the Farmers
Aid Fund to the selected districts/subdistricts.4   The fund would
assist smaller farmers in GPMCs who cannot afford to sell their
rubber through group marketing centers because of the need to hold
back sales for days. By enabling such farmers to take advantage of
higher prices received from bulk sales, their incomes would
increase.
(d) The Royal Forestry Department (RFD) has agreed to issue lease
agreements for replanters in gazetted forests if ORRAF undertakes
the needed surveys on their behalf. Since ORRAP has limited capa-
city to undertake such surveys extensively, RFD should give top
priority to issuing the right to farm (Sor Tor 7or) certificates to
the identified target districts. ORRAF would, under a pilot program
in forest reserves not due for Sor Tor Kor issuance, assist replan-
ters (for a nominal fee) to obtain the lease agreements. The
surveys undertaken through ORRAF would enable farmers to
automatically receive a Sor Tor Kor when the program arrives in
their district.
5.        A special Task Force, which has been established under the aegis of
the National Rubber Policy Committee, would be needed to develop the framework
for providing and monitoring support services through the NRSDP. The Task
Force, chaired by OAE, would comprise representatives from ORRAF, DOAE, RRIT,
BAAC, RFD, NESDB and other relevant agencies.
4/  DOAE, which has been allocated a revolving fund of B 10 million per year
by MOAC for the GPMCs (from the Farmers Aid Fund), would earmark its use
in NRSDP districts/subdistricts.

TTRAILAND
THIRD RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
Assumptions Underlying the Economic Analysisl-
A. Definition of the Project
1.        For the purposes of economic analysis, the project is defined to
include (a) the completion of about 290,000 ha of ongoing ORRAF replanting
presently in the inmature stage, including those initiated under the Second
Tree Crops Project (Ln. 2078-TH); and (b) the initiation of new replantings at
the rate of 50,000 ha p.a. for the 4 year project investment period.
2.        For the "without project" situation it is assumed that ORRAF would
also complete all 290,000 ha of ongoing replantings but would undertake no new
replantings after FY86. Since the proposed project is defined as support to
ORRAF's program FY 87-90, it is most appropriately analyzed by considering the
returns to the entire new program even though a reduced new program may have
been possible without the support of a specific project. About 30% of the
200,000 ha to be replanted with project (i.e., 15,000 ha p.a.) is assumed to
be continued by farmers using their own resources but at a lower level of
inputs and output (see Working Paper No. 7 for details). Another 10% of the
area (20,000 ha) would be replanted to other tree crops principally oil palm,
while 10,000 ha would be replanted to annual crops such as upland rice. On
the bulk of tne area (110,000 ha) tapping of old rubber trees would continue.
Some of the area would be tapped regularly by farmers with access to low cost
family labor with no alternative employment opportunities. Other parts of the
area would be tapped occasionally while yet others would be abandoned. The
aggregate "without project" activity on this land is taken to be tapping of
the old rubber stands for five years after which the land would be abandoned.
3.        In addition to consideration of net benefits foregone on the
200,000 ha of new rubber area to be replanted with project, the '",ithout
project" scenario also takes into account the net benefits foregone in rubber
production outside the project area as a result of the distortions caused in
rubber prices by continuation of the ORRAF program and the cess/"grant" system
(para. 4.07 of the main report and para. 11 below). Recently reduced rubber
prices and the projected continuation of price weakness in the short term is
assumed to lower the planting rate of new rubber outside the project area by
about 5,000 ha p.a. or 20,000 ha over the 4 year project period while output
of senile rubber (which is highly responsive to price movement) is estimated
to drop by 15,000 tons per year.
1/   The assumptions are based on field observations, the recently completed
NIDA/ORRAF Socio-economic Survey and discussions with ORRAF field staff,
local rubber specialists and farmers.



-78-                                ANNEX 7
Page 2
B. Derivation of Economic Prices
4.        Project output prices for rubber are based on the Bank's commodity
price projections for 1985-90 and 1995 expressed in mid-1985 constant dollars
adjusted for international freight, local marketing costs, and quality differ-
entials. Details of rubber price calculations are given in Table 1. Calcula-
tion of fertilizer prices is also based on Bank commodity forecasts and on
recent contract prices (usually undertaken a year ahead of use). The
calculations have been carried out on the basis that "straights" (urea, TSP,
KCL) are imported and manufactured into compound in Thailand according to
ORRAF specifications. Details of these calculations are given in Table 2.
Economic prices of fertilizer are derived by adjusting financial prices by the
Standard 2Cnversion Factor (SCF) of 0.92 to take into account local
taxation.-
5.        The opportunity cost of labor is estimated at B 60 per man-day
adjusted to border prices by the SCF. Prices of other inputs (planting
materials, chemicals) and outputs (rice, oil palm, rubber-wood) are based on
present financial levels and, together with the price of labor, are assumed to
remain constant in real terms through the 32 year period of project economic
analysis. Economic prices for these inputs and outputs are derived by adjust-
ing financial prices by the SCF except in the case of rice where a price
conversion factor of 1.05 is used. Tables 3 and 4 summarize the input and
output prices.
C. Components of Economic Analysis
6.        The economic analysis of the project has been carried out on the
basis of a one year, 50,000 ha ORRAF program"  The major benefit considered
in the rate of return analysis is the incremental output of rubber. Other
benefits included are sales of rubber-wood accruing to an estimated 20Z of
farms and the value of intercrops produced on 70Z of farms intercropping rice
for two years. Details of yield estimates for rubber are presented in
Table 5. Estimates of yields for other crops are described in Working Paper
No. 7. For the "with" project situation, 20% of farmers are assumed to tap
their trees alternate daily with tree opening at 50 cm girth, 60Z would tap
daily at 50 cm girth, while 20% would tap daily at 44 cm girth (para. 4.13,
main report). Farmers replanting with their own resources in the "without
2/   See World Bank, Report No. 4366-TH, Thailand -- Managing Public Resources
for Structural Adjustment, Vol. II, Annex 1, Table 3.
3/   The mid point of the project investment period (1988) is used.  Since
ORRAF is expected to complete ongoing replantings in both the "with" and
"without" project situations, the incremental impact of the proposed
project is the 50,000 ha of new replants to be undertaken each year under
the project. Given that land use "without project" will not vary as each
new set of replants is undertaken, the ERR on a one year 50,000 ha
program will be the same as that on a four year 200,000 ha program.

Page 3
project" situation are assumed to tap daily at 50 cm girth but with tree
opening delayed a further year compared to the "with project" case.
7.        Economic costs considered are net of duties and taxes and include
the costs of ORRAF management, labor, fertilizer, and other input costs needed
to sustain the project's rubber enterprise. The costs of distortion to rubber
prices caused by the cess levy (see para. 11 below) were also included in the
economic analysis. Costs amounting to about $5 million (2X of total project
costs) for investment in rubber research and extension and the potential
benefits from such investment were excluded from the analysis because of the
pilot nature of these investments and the difficulties associated with
estimating accurately the magnitude and timing of benefits.
8.        Economic cost and benefit streams are presented in Table 6.  The
project ERR is estimated at 18%. Sensitivity analysis carried out in terms of
switching values for benefit and cost streams at a 12% opportunity cost of
capital shows that the project is viable under a wide variety of assumptions
on possible adverse impacts on project costs and benefits. (See summary in
Table 4.05 main report). Details are presented in Table 7.
9.        The project would result in a total of 2.5 million man years of
incremental employment over 35 years (Table 8). Direct project beneficiaries
would total 113,000 families replanting 167,000 plots or about 1/2 million
people. The long-run employment impact of the 1987-90 ORRAF program would be
to increase agricultural employment from 1995 to 2015 by an average of 119,000
man-years p.a. in the rubber producing areas (Annex 7, Table 8). However,
after increasing slightly in the first three years of the project (by about
3,000 man-years per year) direct agricultural employment would be 4educed
during 1990-1995 by an average of about 9,000 man-years per year.-   Net
incremental government income after deduction of the costs for the ORRAF
program and the allocation for research would total $576 million over 35
years. Details of fiscal impact are presented in Tables 9 and 10.
D. Additionality
10.       As the project comprises the entire ORRAF program for FY87-90 it has
been analyzed on a "with" and "without" ORRAF program basis. However, because
ORRAF is a well-established semiautonomous body, it is likely that even
without a Bank-financed project it would probably continue for a period of
time albeit at a lower level of activity. Based on estimates of cess
revenues, replanting fund surpluses and assuming that Government will provide
support for administrative expenses, the mission's best estimate is that with-
out outside loan funds %World Bank, CDC or local commercial bank loans), ORRAF
4/   A large proportion of farmers would likely continue tapping senile trees
in the "without project" situation for 3-5 years after trees would have
been felled and replanted "with project." Since labor requirements for
tapp&ng mature or senile rubber per year are typically greater than the
average labor requirements during the immature period of young rubber,
direct employment would be reduced in the period through 1993.

could continue to undertake new replantings during FY87-90 at the rate of
about 30,000 ha/year. Against this background, the additional impact of the
project would still be substantial. It would benefit an additional 400,000
people and would lead to incremental rubber production worth over $1.3 billion
over a 35 year period.
E. The Rubber Replanting Program and Efficiency Costs
11.       ORRAF is considered one of the most successful institutions of its
kind, and Thailand will reap major benefits from its past and continued
activities. The ORRAF program does, however, entail costs; while the benefits
significantly exceed them, it is important to recognize the costs and, where
possible, make every effort to reduce them. The cess system (from which ORRAF
derives an important part of its funding) is itself a cost; it distorts
production incentives by reducing farmgate prices to farmers and may thus
(a) discourage the planting of new rubber, (b) discourage other potentially
more profitable uses of rubber land, and (c) encourage the use of technical
practices (e.g., overintensive tapping during maturity) that are detrimental
to sustaining yield and thus shorten the "economic" life of replanted trees.
The efficiency costs entailed by the ORRAF program are examined in more detail
below. The project economic analysis explicitly takes account of these
costs. Results from the analysis show that the ORRAF program continues to
exhibit high economic returns and thus any disincentives created by the
program are significantly outweighed by the gains.
The Opportunity Cost of Senile Rubber Land and Land Abandonment
12.       One of the most critical judgements made in the ERR analysis
concerns the opportunity cost of senile rubber land and potential land use
"without project." The major assumptions were discussea in para. 2. There
has been some debate on this issue. The major questions concern (a) the time
period farmers will continue to tap their senile rubber plot before abandoning
it, (b) the size of the area that might be replanted to rubber by farmers
using their own resources, and (c) the size of area that might be replanted to
other potentially more profitable tree crops such as oil palm.
13.       With respect to the issue of abandonment, the approach fol'-owed in
the economic analysis has been to look at a time slice of a block of land
(comprising many potential beneficiaries) w0ch would be totally replanted
with project but would not without project.- On some of the land belonging
5/ An alternative approach would be to compare the "with ORRAF" and the
likely "without ORRAF" situation for total rubber area over a long period
of time. The implicit assumption then is that all land would eventually
get replanted to something, but in the "without OPRRF" situation the
delay in such replanting (during which time some of the land would be
toeconomically" abandoned) would be compounded until, say 70 years hence,
equilibrium would be reached. Such an equilbrium state would involve
about a 27 year replanting cycle "with ORRAF" but perhaps a 50 year cycle
"without ORRAF".  An analysis based on this approach could be constructed

ANNES 7
Page 5
to people with very low financial opportunity cost of labor senile rubber
would continue to be tapped in perpetuity while, on other land (where share-
tappers are used and/or labor costs are high), production would be immediately
abandoned. To accommodate the range of possible land uses and to facilitate
estimates of a rate of return on a specific timebound set of investments, an
average ("without project") situation of tapping for five years followed by
abandonment was assumed. The alternative of a ten-year tapping period on the
ERR was also explored in the sensitivity analysis (para. 16 below).
Size of Area Replanted to Rubber and Other Crops
14.       The farm level financial analysis of the project (para. 4.13 (main
text)) shows that the financial returns to replanting with farmers' own
resources are much less than to replanting with ORRAF (FRR 15% compared to 25%
with ORRAF). Based on these returns, and on the fact that the availability of
medium- to long-term credit in the rural areas is limited, it is unlikely that
the majority of farmers' could afford to replant on their own. The mission's
best estimate is that, at most, 30% of the rubber land area would be replanted
to rubber without the project.
15.       Replantings to annual crops would be limited by poor soil and
physical conditions. Most of the existing senile rubber is on relatively poor
upland soils, generally not well suited to paddy or other annual crops.
Replanting to tree crops such as coconut and cocoa is unlikely because these
two crops are generally not competitive in existing senile rubber areas. The
only reaL alternative to rubber is replanting to oil palm. Returns to oil
palm are at present very attractive (FRR 31% compared to 25% for rubber
replanting, see working Paper No. 7 for details). However, the extent to
which farmers can replant to oil palm is limited by agro-ecological
suitability, processing 6facility proximity, and the need for timely and
disciplined harvesting.-   In light of these limiting factors an estimated 10%
of area replanted to oil palm without project is considered appropriate.-
6/   The need for proper maintenance, timely and disciplined harvesting, and
the cost of neglecting these factors are underscored in a study of three
oil palm settlement schemes in Thailand. See Pilot Project and
Rehabilitation Programme on Three Oil Palm Settlement Schemes, Guthrie
International Plantation Services (1981).
7/   Oil palm in Thailand is limited less by soil and physical conditions than
by the lengthy dry season which affects flowering (and thus yields) and
reduces the availability of continuous harvesting. Furthermore, the
current high profitability of oil palm is due to a shortage of oil for
domestic consumption and to excess milling capacity which results in
intense competition for raw material. This situation is likely to change
by about the end of the decade when production is expected to be surplus
to Thailand's needs and further quantities will have to be sold at world
market prices. The current domestic price is about 22% above world
prices.

Sensitivity Tests On Opportunity Cost of Land
16.       Sensitivity tests were carried out to examine the impact on the pro-
ject of variations on the above assumptions on land use "without project"
including assumptions on the benefits foregone in rubber areas outside the
project as a result of continuing with the ORRAF program. The tests are
detailed in Table 7 as test cases 5, 6, 7 and 8. A 50% increase in the area
replanted to rubber by farmers using their own resources (and a consequent 27%
decline in tapping of senile rubber area) increases the project ERR slightly
but decreases the net present value (NPV) at 12% opportunity cost of capital
(OCC) by about 13Z. A combined increase of 50% (from 20,000 to 30,000 ha per
annum) in both the areas replanted to rubber and oil palm "without project"
decreases the NPY by 15x. A 100X increase in the senile rubber output outside
the project area (Test Case 8) decreases the NPV by 7% and results in a fall
in the ERR to 17.4%. In the most extreme case examined (Test Case 7), an
increase in both new planting outside the project area, replanting to rubber
and to oil palm of 502, the NPV falls by about a quarter of the base case
level. Furthermore, a doubling in the number of years (from 5 to 10 years)
over which senile rubber is tapped in the replanted area before being
abandoned only has a minor effect on the ERR. It drops from 18.0% to 17.5%
while the NPV falls by 72 (Table 7). Within a reasonable range of "without
project" assumptions about land use, the ERR of the project is quite stable.
Although its NPV falls as higher rates of without project activity are
assumed, it is most unlikely to become negative. For example, the switching
value for the "replanting own resource/tapping senile rubber" combination is
60,650 ha. That means that replanting without project would need to be
10,650 ha greater than "with project," all other things being equal, for the
project to be uneconomic -- a highly unlikely situation.
Disincentives to Choice of Technique
17.       Another possible cost of the ORRAF program and the cess/"replanting
grant" system is that it may encourage smallholders to use low production
inputs and high tapping intensities (which result in the rapid exploitation of
trees) to get new replanting done earlier. It is difficult to get data on the
extent of this overexploitation. ORRAF's statistics over the last few years
on "second round replanters" indicate that less than 1% of smallholders have
come back for a second grant each year for a plot already replanted.
Nonetheless, assuming that high tapping intensities are taking place in a
number of instances, it is difficult to assess the extent to which the
"grant"/cess program or any alternative system of financing influences this
behavior. Smallholders all over the world tend to react principally to the
opportunity of short run gain and, at the high personal discount rates that
are likely to apply to this group of farmers, even a small sacrifice of the
present value of production soon offsets the value of the future crop. It is
questionable whether the majority of smallholders, typically in their forties,
are influenced in their exploitation of rubber by the expectation of a grant
some 20 years later, particularly given the political uncertainties
surrounding the possibilities of "cashing in" at that later date.



- 83 -
ANNEX 7
Page 7
Smallholders who employ share-tappers have limited control over their tapping
techniques and share-tappers have every incentive to tap intensively. Another
consideration is that a longer lasting tree may defer access to the never,
potentially more productive, clones coming out of the breeding programs. It
also defers adoption of improved husbandry practices during immaturity, which
have a critical impact on the productivity of the tree throughout its bearing
life. To avoid over exploitation of the trees under the present system, all
such abuses will be taken into account in according priority to the selection
of replanters during the application process.
Disincentives from Taxation and Cost Recovery
18.       Rubber taxation, viewed in isolation, has a negative effect on
rubber development. It depresses the farm gate price of rubber, and hence the
financial attractiveness of planting and tapping. This results in lower
planting rates and renders the tapping of some low yielding rubber uneco-
nomic. In Thailand's case, a clear distinction should be drawn between the
export tax and the cess. The cess is channelled back to farmers through ORRAF
grants, while the export tax raises general revenues for the Government
budget. In the past 5 years, the cess has averaged 7% of the local wholesale
rubber price, whereas the export tax has averaged 21%. Government has always
fully recovered the costs of the ORRAF program, including the allocation to
research, through rubber taxation. Over the past 5 years, the cost recovery
has averaged 260% (57% through the cess and 203% through the export tax).
This high level of taxation is not necessary to support the public sector
intervention in rubber replanting. In fact, the cess alone may be considered
sufficient to recover the cost of replanting (Tables 11 and 12). A look at
the historical cost recovery ratio for a 1984 ORRAF replanter with modest
yields, who has paid into the cess for the past 20 years shows that, at a low
(3Z) discou. rate, the cost of the replanting assistance including
administration of the "grant" would have been fully recovered. Alternatively,
if the replanting assistance is viewed as a loan at 12% interest to a typical
replanter under the project, the replanting "grant" (including "grant"
administration costs) would be fully recovered within 16 years from the start
of replanting. Government has recognized the high burden of taxation on the
rubber sector and has recently reduced the export tax by 57%. Further
reductions should be considered. By reducing or removing the export tax,
while maintaining the cess, the Government would encourage more plantings as
well as maintain the gains from replanting under the ORRAF program.
19.       The test for the cost effectiveness of earmarking the cess for rub-
ber replanting would therefore be the economic rate of return to the program
taking the above discussed distortions into account (see para. 11). The
economic analysis of the project demonstrates that the important benefits to
be gained by support of the ORRAF program outweighs the cost of these
distortions.

THAILAND
THIRD RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
ORRAF Finance 11
1.        ORRAF's overall financial position, which is largely dependent on
the rubber cess, poses an important problem for the project. Cess revenues,
which are based on an export price formula, and rubber export tax collections
have always exceeded the cost of support to rubber replanters. However, since
rubber export taxes are earmarked for general government revenues, ORRAF has
had to depend on the cess as the primary source of funds for its operations.
The specific earmarking of cess revenues for the replanting program is
justified by its importance in national development objectives (para. 1.05,
main text), its economic benefits (Annex 7) and the severe delays and
disruption (and Rtential income losses) which result from undue reliance on
budgetary funds._    The cess has, however, declined in importance as a source
of ORRAF funds: it exceeded total ORRAF costs until 1974, but averaged about
72% of costs in 1975-79 and dropped to 50% in 1980-84.
2.        Rubber cess revenues are estimated to total B 4,264 million
(US$164 million) over the project period, of which, under the terms of the
Rubber Replanting Aid Fund Act (ORRAF Act), 95% or US$156 million would be
available to ORRAF (see Table 1). With total ORRAF project costs estimated at
US$259 million, the overall supplementary funding requirement is US$103 mil-
lion.
3.        The funding requirement must be viewed against the background of two
other provisions of the ORRAF Act which have in recent years been detrimental
to ORRAF's financial security: (a) the formula by which the cess rate is cal-
culated and (b) the allocation of cess revenues between direct replanting
costs and the costs associated with administering the program.
4.        The cess rate is established according to a formula linking it to
the world rubber price but without reference to the size of the rubber
replanting program. The linkage to world rubber prices has resulted in ORRAF
facing (often large) fluctuations in cess revenues to be set against steadily
increasing replanting costs. The present cess rate is 35Z lower, in real
terms, than that prevailing in 1965 while ORRAF's replanting program has
increased nearly tenfold from about 5,000 ha p.a. in the mid-1960s to an
average of about 48,000 ha p.a. in 1982-85. As a result, the cess income of
B 645 million in 1984 was just under 50Z of ORRAF's total financing needs
1/   Details of financial background of ORRAF is given in Working Paper No. 4,
Project File.
2/   In addition, cess benefits are viewed as a right because rubber
replanters have already "paid for it" through cess payments on their pre-
replanted rubber stand.

(B 1,300 million) in that year (Table 2). Furthermore, ORRAF's actual cess
income in the first 3 years of the second project (1982-84), at B 457.4 mil-
lion, was only 57% of the cess collections projected at appraisal in late 1980
(see Table 3). Essentially due to the overprojection of rubber prices, the
cess shortfall seriously disrupted operations of the replanting program in
1983-84. For example, ORRAF, in 1984, restricted replanting from 50,000 ha to
36,700 ha (foregoing annual production of 30,000 tons of rubber valued at
US$25 million p.a. at full maturity). If interim funding, particularly for
administration (see below), had not been obtained from CDC in late 1984, the
1985 program would have also suffered.
5.        The ORRAF Act also allocates cess revenue between:  direct
replanting costs, the Replanting Fund, (90%), ORRAF's administration costs,
the Administration Fund, (5Z); and the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand
(5%). The 5% allocation for ORRAF administration has long since ceased to
accord with reality; despite cost control (ORRAF's administration costs in
recent years have been maintained at about 18% of total ORRAF costs or 21Z of
replanting costs), the 5% cess allocation covered only 15% of 1984's admini-
strative costs. ORRAF has financed the shortfall by the interest earned on
Replanting Fund surpluses and by Government grants, the bulk of which have
been borrowed from CDC and the World Bank. Greater financial independence for
ORRAF would, therefore, require a greater proportion of cess to be allocated
to ORRAF administration.
6.        The cabinet has approved amendments to the ORRAF Act, which
includes, inter alia: (a) the revision of the cess formula to a flat (baht
per kg) rate and (b) the proportion of total cess revenues allocated to
administration to be increased to a maximum of,10 (and, correspondirgly, that
allocated to Replanting Fund reduced to 85Z)._   A flat rate cess would
largely eliminate the often substantial revenue fluctuations associated with
unstable world rubber prices. The extent to which ORRAF would still be
dependent on government subventions would depend largely on the rate of cess
fixed, the rate of rubber exports, and on the rate of replanting. In fixing
the cess level, consideration will have to be given to (a) the extent (and
when) ORRAF should be fully self-sufficient;- (b) expected changes in the
"grant" level; and (c) Government's debt servicing obligations for the ORRAF
program.
7.        The financing plan for the ORRAF project component is proposed as
follows:
3/   See Working Paper No. 4, Appendix 3 on the draft amendment.
41   The appraisal mission concluded that a B 2 per kg cess rate (in 1985
prices) would be sufficient to cover the replanting costs of a 50,000 ha
p.a. program, by about 1994. Government has indicated that its target
for the 6th Development Plan (1987-90) is 50,000 ha/year.

Note:  Numbers do not add up due to rounding.
Cess revenues allocated to ORRAF are conservatively projected to be $156 mil-
lion (See Table 1) during the project (FY1987-90). A carryover surplus in the
replanting fund of B 264 million (US$10.2 million) from FY86 will be drawn
down during FY87, leaving a balance of B 700 million at the end of that year
to serve as a contingency reserve (Tables 4-6). This amount corresponds to
the average end-of-year balance which ORRAF had been carrying forward on its
Replanting Fund since the start of the replanting program in 1961. Interest
from this surplus, as in the past, would help finance the Administration Fund.
8.        Government subventions from the budget have been kept to a minimum
to reflect the reality of an acute financial situation facing Government.
Government's contribution would in any case be greater than any direct subven-
tion because it is also assuming the full cost of servicing and repaying the
loans from the external lenders. Assuming an external loan of US$60 million
for the ORRAF component and an average interest rate thereon of 8.5% p.a.,
Government's additional costs during the project period alone would amount to
about US$13 million.
9.        Tables 6-7 illustrate ORRAF's estimated cash flow separately for the
replanting fund and the administration fund for the project period (FY87-
90). A precarious situation exists on the Administration Fund because only 5%
of cess revenues are allocated to it and it does not have a contingency
reserve to draw upon as in the replanting fund (para. 7). However, price
contingencies and a conservative assumption of cess revenues have been aLlowed
for, and the government budgetary allocation of B 228 million (US$8.8 million)
appears sufficient to cover any financing gap.
