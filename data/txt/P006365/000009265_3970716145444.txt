IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
NORTHEAST BASIC HEALTH SERVICES PROJECT
LN. 2699-BR
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Northeast Basic
Health Services Project in Brazil, for which Loan 2699-BR in the amount of US$59.5
million equivalent was approved on May 22, 1986 and made effective on July 29, 1987.
The ICR was prepared by Jean Jacques de St. Antoine (LASHD) with the
collaboration of Claudia Rosenthal (consultant) and Brenda C. Enuton (LASHD). It was
reviewed by Alain Colliou, Country Sector Leader (LAI) and Orville Grimes, Projects
Adviser (LAI). The Borrower provided comments that are included as Appendix A to the
ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final completion mission in
June 1996. It is based on materials in the project file, interviews with the Borrower and
field visits. This project was also reviewed by the Bank-Brazil Portfolio Commission
which is expected to present its final report in early 1997.

BRAZIL
NORTHEAST BASIC HEALTH SERVICES PROJECT
LN. 2699-BR
Introduction. The Bank's health sector and project work in Brazil started in 1976 with
the inclusion of health components (Ln. 6273-BR) in Northeast rural development
projects. While these components did much to improve access to services, they were
generally not designed to improve the management and quality of health services.
The Bank's first free-standing health project (Ln. 2061-BR), in Rondonia, was designed to
improve, among other things, access to basic health services. A second health project (Ln.
2447-BR) was approved in June 1984. It aimed at supporting the development of a new
model of basic health services in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo by addressing health
care needs in an equitable and efficient manner.
In April 1985 the Brazilian Government approved a 15-year development plan for the
Northeast region. The health part of this plan was the Northeast Basic Health Services
Project which would be implemented in three phases, according to the different capacities
of the states to carry it out. The Government of Brazil requested Bank financial support
to that effect.
Project Objectives. The main objective of the Project was to support the Borrower's
effort to improve equity, efficiency and effectiveness of basic health care in the project
area by: (a) improving and expanding the operation of the basic health facilities network;
and (b) improving the institutional capabilities of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and State
Health Secretariats (SESs). The project was designed to assist the Government in
improving the health status of the rural poor, about 5 million small farm families, living in
four states of the Northeast of Brazil (Bahia, Rio Grande do Norte, Piaui and a part of
Minas Gerais).

Implementation Experience and Results. Implementation was slow until 1994. During
its overall implementation period of about 10 years, there was a succession of eight
project managers and as many health ministers. The project itself was shifted frequently
from one department to another inside the Ministry according to the priorities of the
various administrations. Political changes and weak management were perhaps the result
of lack of commitment to the project not only at the central level but also at the local level.
The interval between the date of effectiveness and the first disbursement was different
among the various states. It was as long as one year for the state of Bahia. Bureaucratic
obstacles at the federal and state level delayed procurement, disbursements, counterpart
payments, and hiring of manpower. However, all these problems were addressed and
experience was gained by the Federal Government and the States in the implementation of
this type of project. One of the legacies of the project is this experience, together with the
management skills developed during Project implementation.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned. The project
was born in a difficult context characterized by political and macroeconomic instability, by
reduced technical and managerial capabilities, and by a changing and uncertain institutional
environment. Consequently the project was slow in achieving its objectives until 1994, by
which time only 55 percent of the funds had been disbursed over a six-year period.

The Bank's earlier supervision efforts started to produce significant results when the
Government changed in 1994, and the status of project implementation was reviewed with
the Bank. The Bank suggested a series of measures through which procedures were made
more flexible, and increased its supervision efforts by 50 percent; while the Government
introduced management improvements and decentralization of decisions. Strong support
from the Minister of Health provided political and technical support to the project
implementation at all levels. To give time for the newly introduced measures to produce
results, the project closing date was extended by one year. As a result the project
regained momentum and 45 percent of the funds were disbursed in the last two years of
the project. Progress in meeting project implementation schedule was faster in the states
of Piaui and Rio Grande do Norte and slower in Bahia and Minas Gerais.
The project was implemented in 217 municipalities of Bahia, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte
and Minas Gerais (Northern Region and Valley of Jequitinhona). It benefited a population
of 5.2 million representing an improvement in basic health services for an average of about
28 percent of the total population of these four states. This was the result of increased
access, improved facilities and equipment, and better-trained human resources leading to
better quality.
The main lessons learned during project implementation are in the realm of technical and
managerial capabilities, institutional environment, and project design. Having addressed
these issues successfully, the future operation of basic health services in the four states
targeted by the project stands a strong chance of being sustained. In addition, the
inclusion in 1996 of these same states in the Second Northeast Basic Health Services
Project will give them more time to consolidate the improvements achieved.

BRAZIL
NORTHEAST BASIC HEALTH SERVICES REPORT
(Ln. 2699-BR)
PART 1: FINDINGS AND LESSONS
A. Background
1.    The Northeast.  At the time of project preparation, Brazil had made substantial
progress in developing its health care system. Nevertheless, health conditions were still
generally poor considering the country's overall level of development. Health conditions
were worse and health resources more scarce in the Northeast region of the country. The
population in this region had the lowest health status in the country as reflected by the
lowest life expectancy (50 years), highest infant mortality rate (132 per 1,000), and a high
prevalence of infectious diseases. The most important causes of illness and death in
children under five years of age were gastrointestinal and respiratory infections, perinatal
diseases, low birth weight, and malnutrition. Infant deaths accounted for 35 to 40 percent
of the total deaths in the Northeast. In 1986 the Northeast accounted for 29 percent of
Brazil's total population and 45 percent of the country's rural population. Over 70 percent
of all Northeastern families earned, including income in kind, US $675 per capita or less,
annually. During the 1980s, equity of access to health services between income groups
and geographical areas remained a significant problem, especially in the rural areas.
2.    Institutions.   During the early 1980s political and institutional changes were
taking place in Brazil and social investments in the health sector among others became a
priority on the Government's agenda. Brazil's public health care sector has undergone
significant institutional, organizational, and financial reforms over the past decade. The
original institutional framework dated from 1953, when the National Public Health
Department became the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the State Health Secretariats
began to be established. The major public health sector institution, the National Institute
for Social Security and Medical Assistance (INAMPS), was created in 1967 by merging
several social security programs. INAMPS was supervised by the Ministry of Welfare and
Social Security (MPAS) which enjoyed significant financial and operational autonomy.
The MOH was responsible for setting national health policy and collective health
programs, and delivering preventive health services; while the MPAS provided individual
medical care services.
3.    At the state level, the State Secretariats of Health (SESs) were traditionally
oriented to infectious disease control and delivery of maternal and child health care.
Remaining health services were provided largely by the private sector, generally
reimbursed by INAMPS. At the local level, there are currently about 5,000 municipalities
in the country, with varying needs and levels of administrative capacity. Health service
facilities in the North and Northeast are often poorly managed and badly funded.
4.    Efforts Toward Change. The Government's interest in redressing the inequity
and inefficiency of the health care system led to the design and implementation of a



2
number of national strategies. In 1976, the Government introduced the PIASS (Program
for the Implementation in Interior Areas of Health and Sanitation Activities), a program to
bring basic health and sanitation activities to communities of less than 20,000 people. In
1979, the Fund for Social Development Assistance (FAS) changed its policy to finance
basic health facilities, thus reducing hospital bed construction from 6,000 in 1980 to 3,000
in 1982. In 1980, the Curitiba plan established the health center as the patient's point of
entry to the health system, and established fixed payments from INAMPS for given
procedures rather than fee-for-service, an attempt to improve the system of reimbursement
and to reduce costs. In 1982, the Consultative Council on Health Insurance
Administration (CONASP) made recommendations for better use of existing public sector
facilities, improvement of systems of reimbursement to public and private health agencies,
and strengthening of the managerial capacity of the public sector. The AIS (Integrated
Health Actions) was created in 1983 to implement most of these recommendations. In
1982, FINSOCIAL was established as a fund using earmarked revenues to support social
sector programs. More recently, the MOH has supported the State Secretariats of Health
(SESs) in their efforts to "municipalize" health services and in the implementation of a
program to expand basic health services in low-income urban areas.
5.    National Health System.   Brazil's Constitution of 1988 ratified changes in the
country's health system over the preceding decades such as universal coverage to all
citizens. It also established that a Single Health System (SUS) should operate through a
decentralized regional network, with management at the various levels of government
giving priority to preventive care activities. The SUS was instituted in 1990 and the state
and municipal governments are working towards the development of health care services
according to the new system.
B. Project Objectives
6.    Objectives.  The proposed project aimed at supporting the Borrower's efforts to
improve the equity, efficiency and effectiveness of basic health care in the project area.
7.    Definition. The project had two sets of objectives: (a) to improve and expand the
operation of the basic health facilities network; and (b) to improve the institutional
capabilities of the MOH and SESs. To achieve these objectives the project would: (a)
improve the organization and use of resources for delivering a package of three programs
of basic health services: (i) a program of comprehensive care for women and children; (ii)
a program of infectious disease control; and, (iii) a program of walk-in as well as hospital-
based medical care; (b) improve and expand the network of basic health facilities; (c)
strengthen the institutional capabilities of the State Secretariats of Health and of the
Ministry of Health in the areas of strategic planning, administration and management; and
(d) prepare a second-phase project for the other six states of the Northeast.
8.    Cost and Timing.   At an expected cost of US$59.5 million, the project was
made effective on September 29, 1987, and was expected to be completed on June 30,
1994. The project closing date was later extended once to December 31, 1995.
9.    Evaluation.  Given (i) the social and sanitary conditions in the Northeast at the
time of project preparation, and (ii) a demand for measures to reduce the effects of those



3
conditions and to support all efforts toward institutional strengthening in the area, the
project was justified. The Northeast Basic Health Services Project was among the first
attempts at implementing social programs in the Northeast aiming at poverty reduction
through health sector improvements.
10.   Achievement of Objectives. The project was implemented in 217 municipalities
of Bahia, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte and Minas Gerais (Northern Region and Valley of
Jequitinhona). It has benefited a population of 5.2 million, representing about 28 percent
of the total population of these four states. Basic health services were improved as a
result of increased access, improved facilities and equipment, and better-trained human
resources.
11.   The project was slow in achieving its objectives until 1994, by which time only 55
percent of the funds had been disbursed over the 6-year period. The Bank's earlier
supervision efforts started to produce significant results in 1994 when the Government
changed and the status of project implementation was reviewed with the Bank.
12.   The new Health Minister expressed his total support to the project. He appointed a
new PCU manager with strong management experience and made the PCU directly
responsible to the top management level of the Ministry. The Minister met with the
Governors of the four participating states and emphasized the importance of improving
project implementation in light of (i) the Government's reemphasized policy of reducing
infant and maternal mortality in the Northeast and (ii) the need to improve portfolio
performance so as to be able to justify borrowing for new projects (the Brazil Health
Sector Reform: 4047-BR) was under discussion with the Bank at the time). The Bank
suggested a series of measures through which procedures were made more flexible.
Competition for funds was introduced and increased technical assistance was provided to
poorer performing states, notably in the area of procurement. The Bank increased its
supervision efforts by 50 percent. To give time for the newly-introduced measures to
produce results, the closing date was extended by one year. The combination of all these
efforts made the project regain momentum. As a result, 45 percent of the funds were
disbursed in the last two years of the project.
13.   Although implementation was slow, the project fully achieved its objectives
regarding infrastructure and equipment, and partly on the institutional side. The project
helped construct and rehabilitate 408 health facilities (representing 45 percent of the
project cost) and provided equipment to 450 facilities (18 percent of project cost). The
quality of infrastructure was generally good. Initially the project gave priority to the
construction of health posts and, at a later stage, to the construction of health units
('unidades mistas') which are capable of providing  more comprehensive health care
activities. In about 20 percent of the cases, there was a lag between construction and
staffing, mainly because of the complicated Brazilian contracting law, but in the end
nearly all new units have been adequately staffed and supplied.
14.   The flexibility introduced by the Bank in 1994 extended the number of departments
covered and allowed new municipalities to benefit from the project. There was also an
increase in the number of facilities built or rehabilitated in peri-urban areas where there
was a pressure on existing health facilities as a result of migration from rural areas. Thus



4
the project became better adapted to the change in local demand. Finally, construction of
10 small local hospitals and 6 outpatient clinics, not contemplated in the original design,
was also undertaken.
15.   The objectives of the institutional component were partly achieved. A total of 1288
events (in-service training, courses, and seminars) were conducted, representing about 16
percent of total project cost, and 95 percent of the original target. The purpose of the
training was to improve the management of health facilities and the quality of health care
services. In addition to general management, technical subjects were covered including
maternal, child, and adolescent health, control of communicable diseases, and outpatient
and hospital care. Half of the courses were in-service training and the rest were seminars
and workshops. About two-thirds of beneficiaries were from the interior of the states. An
assessment of the training program shows that training could have been more effective if
there had been: (i) a more focused program (there were too many dispersed small
programs); (ii) a higher proportion of in-service training; and (iii) better monitoring and
evaluation by the states and the PCU during project implementation. Nevertheless, there is
a general consensus among beneficiary states and independent experts (notably the Joint
World Bank-Brazil Portfolio Commission) that the project leaves behind a stronger
network of health personnel in the Northeast, which has helped improve the
implementation of the Unified Health System (SUS).
16.   The studies component represented 7 percent of total project cost and was 95
percent executed. A review of studies made shows a number of important areas addressed
by the four states to better adapt health management to changes in the SUS: (i) updating
of the epiderniological profile; (ii) improvement of management information systems; (iii)
strengthening of health management in municipalities; and (iv) administrative
reorganizations of state ministries of health. There were also some interesting individual
state initiatives such as an evaluation of the mental health delivery model in Bahia; and the
distribution of drugs and supplies in Minas Gerais.
C. Project Implementation
17.   Implementation and Major Factors Affecting the Project. The main problems
with the implementation of the project up to the year 1994 are summarized as follows:
(a) Smaller emphasis on institutional component: this results from the lack of priority given
by the PCU and the states. This was reflected in the project staffing that had a significant
proportion of engineers and administrators. High-quality technical staff capable of
strengthening the implementation of this component were relatively rare.
(b) Lack of counterpart funds: counterpart funds were difficult to secure during the first
three years of the project. The main reasons were delays in approval of the federal budget;
the states' non-compliance in providing timely justification for the expenditures made out of
federal transfers (when this happens, the federal government suspends new transfer of funds



5
to the states); macroeconomic instability, and high inflation. The fact that the Bank allowed
the use of Special Account funds to be used as advances, together with matching
counterpart funds, facilitated disbursements because there was no longer a need for the
counterpart funds to cover the full cash flow up to reimbursement. Counterpart funds have
been adequate and timely since 1994.
(c) Inadequate project design: the project was designed by the MOH and SESs, with the
consultation of municipalities, at a time when health programs were still managed centrally
at the Ministry and did not include the proper instruments for implementation at the state
and municipal level. These had to be created when the SUS was introduced, thus causing
delays.  The project design was rigid particularly in the infrastructure and equipment
components. The location of all facilities was based on a mid-1980s supply and demand
study. Up to 1995, any change warranted as a result of the creation of new facilities by the
private sector in the same vicinity, or change in demand because of migration, required
waivers from the Bank, which caused delays. The target group was the rural population of
the Northeast which in 1980 accounted for 49.5 percent of its total population, but in 1991
for only 39.3 percent. Also, funds had been allocated to each state from the start, so that
there was no incentive for poor performers to improve or for better performers to try to
improve further.  On the other hand, more attention should have been paid to the
management of the institutional component by better organizing and staffing the federal and
state PCUs with institutional specialists from the beginning of the project.
(d) Evolving roles of the federal, state, and municipal levels: as is the case in most changes
and reorganizations, the change of the Constitution in 1988 followed by the introduction of
the SUS in 1990 resulted in new learning and adaptation by all actors involved. The SUS
strengthened the role of municipalities in health delivery and established a direct link
between the federal level and municipalities that received funds for operating the system
directly from the federal level. However, the role of the states remained poorly defined. This
affected the performance of the project, whose design depended upon a strong leadership
role by the states. It took a number of years for the role of the respective actors to become
clearer, and there is still progress to be made in that area.
(e) Frequent changes in Government: during the project life, there were eight changes of
Ministers of Health.  These changes resulted in further changes at other levels of
government, usually halting actions and decisions and delaying project implementation.
Also, priorities changed from one administration to another, and commitments made by
prior administrations were not always maintained by subsequent ones.
(f) Weak management: the lack of political commitment resulted in weak management of
the project at both the federal and state levels. Political changes resulted in frequent rotation
of federal and state project coordinators. Significant time was lost by new teams having to
learn about the project. In spite of the above, between 1987 and 1994 the project did help,
albeit slowly, to strengthen local capacity. Even at the federal level, some key staff (notably
the Financial Manager) remained the same throughout the project. As of 1994, strong
political commitment, the appointment of a dynamic PCU manager, and adaptation in
project design, gave new momentum to the project.



6
(g) Absence of baseline information: there was an absence of a baseline study that would
have constituted an important instrument for evaluation of results and achievements of the
established goals. Upon the Bank's suggestion, the Government is currently undertaking a
detailed evaluation of the project, including an attempt to reconstruct a baseline, measure a
number of indicators, and assess beneficiaries' satisfaction.
(h) Lack of knowledge of Bank procurement practices: the difficulties and delays caused by
lack of knowledge of Bank procurement practices until 1994 were addressed by project
management through training in norms and procedures. The introduction of standard
bidding documents for national competitive bidding was instrumental in improving the
efficiency of the procurement process. A series of seminars was conducted and contributed
to a better understanding of procurement practices.
D. Project Sustainability
18.   Northeast Basic Health Project. This is a highly sustainable project. The project
was slow to achieve its objectives, but after eight years, all the infrastructure and
equipment targets had been met. The network of facilities created is satisfactorily supplied
and staffed. The capacity of the personnel has improved, although not as much as could
have been expected. The recurrent expenditures for the facilities financed under the
project are being financed under the SUS and this financing is expected to continue
uninterrupted in the future. The increased role of municipalities in the SUS helps make the
system more sustainable, as a good functioning of the health network is an important
element of the local population's appreciation of the performance of mayors and other
elected local officials.
E. Performance
19.   Overall, Bank performance was satisfactory in project identification, preparation
assistance, appraisal, and supervision. Project supervision was intensified and improved
during the later years. Borrower performance was satisfactory in project preparation.
The implementation was initially slow but became satisfactory after 1994, as was the
operation of the project. Covenant compliance has been highly satisfactory.
H. Assessment of Outcome
20.   The project's outcome is satisfactory. A network of facilities was established that
responded to an unsatisfied demand in rural and peri-urban areas. Personnel were trained
and, although there is still progress to be made, the implementation of the SUS has
improved. SUS financing of the expanded network is likely to be sustainable. In terms of
health outcomes, there was a significant drop in infant mortality during the project's life.
Infant mortality has dropped more sharply in the four project states compared to the
national average. As shown in the table below, the drop has been between 26 percent and
46 percent over a period of nine years. Because of multicausal effects on infant mortality
(basic sanitation, income, education, etc.), one must be cautious in attributing this result to
the project. Nevertheless, it is an interesting observation.

I. Future Operations
21.    The Government is carrying out a detailed evaluation of the project in the region.
The survey will measure a number of indicators and also assess beneficiary satisfaction.
This should lead to a detailed assessment of project benefits, user satisfaction, and to the
introduction of performance monitoring indicators to be used by the four project states in
operating their health system in the future. The output indicators to be used include: (i) an
increase in number of consultations and treatments in both outpatient facilities and
hospitals; (ii) an increase in number of outpatient consultations as a proportion of total
consultations; (iii) an increase in pediatric services provided; and (iv) an increase in
obstetric services provided.
J. Key Lessons Learned
22.    Through the experience gained during the project implementation, the following
are the key lessons learned:



8
(a)    Especially in a multi-state project, the design should be flexible and should include
proper instruments and procedures that allow for adaptations to the evolving needs of the
Borrower in general, and the States in particular. When more flexibility was introduced in
the present project in 1994, project performance improved significantly.
(b)   Project success is directly correlated with Government commitment. At the
Federal level, strong support by the Health Minister in 1995 resulted in accelerated project
implementation. States with more committed Governors were more successful than
others. Project design should introduce flexibility to allow states more committed or
efficient than others to be rewarded through access to additional funds.
(c)    Project implementation needs effective and sustainable institutional arrangements.
This allows management to provide for the continuity of the project in an environment of
changes.
(d)   The lack of continuity of project management negatively affected project
implementation. However, in a number of specific cases, changes were favorable as
incompetent managers were replaced.
(e)   Pro-active Bank supervision helps improve project implementation. As from 1994,
the Bank helped transfer and adapt the experience of successful projects. The relationship
of trust established with the Borrower was conducive to positive changes.
(f)    The establishment of baseline indicators is essential for project monitoring and
evaluation. The lack of indicators in this project will delay its detailed evaluation.
(g)   Bank projects in the health sector in Brazil should continue to support the
implementation of the SUS and municipal service delivery.
(h)   To ensure better effectiveness, investments in training and other forms of
institutional strengthening should be implemented at least at the same pace as investments
in civil works and equipment. Better staffing of the PCU with institutional specialists
would have improved project implementation.

Appendix A
BORROWER'S COMMENTS
(Translated from Portuguese)
We consider that the Bank report describes with much objectiveness the history of the
implementation of the project. It underlines clearly the joint efforts made by the Government and
the Bank to make the project more flexible and adapt it to the evolving requirements of the SUS,
while respecting the proper technical criteria and the requirements of the Loan Agreement.
I.    Introduction
Now that the First Northeast Basic Health Services Project (PNE I) has been closed, some
general comments can be made about its performance, and problems that of the agencies involved
in its execution. This project was characterized by some problems which affected its technical
management performance, but what is more important are the lessons at all levels that participated
in one way or another in its execution. The project was difficult to implement. However, despite
all the difficulties encountered, within the social sector in Brazil and definitely in the health area, it
offered a wide range of options for utilization of financial resources coupled with a great
flexibility in expenditure, notwithstanding the rigid operating rules.
While the final outcome, from the standpoint of use of financial resources and the
accomplishment of its goals for the Northeast region was positive, some observations are still
warranted. Problems detected in the functioning of the services set up will be dealt with in the
same way as the country's other services in the context of the rules and standards applicable to
the sector. While the project had an atypical source of financing, its ultimate objectives cannot be
separated from the objectives of the national health policy, and the goals achieved must be viewed
as one more effort by the Ministry of Health and the State Health Secretariats to ensure access to
the health services for the population.
Although the PNE I allocated the bulk of its resources to the civil works and equipment
categories, it also focused on a number of specific needs in a way that can be considered
innovative for an investment project: (i) the need for management innovations, as indicated by
the consultancy category; (ii) the need to upgrade the quality of the human resources, as reflected
in the training and supervision category; (iii) the need to change the current assistance model, as
demonstrated by the ranking of the systems based on the primary care services; and (iv) the need
to invest more in direct and indirect forms of technical assistance to the States through
consultancy services from the central level.
This hybrid nature meant that the PNE I was marked from the start by a number of
contradictions, including:
(i)   the contradiction between the interests of the regional political authorities in carrying out



22
works (which can often be used for electoral purposes) and the interests of the national
health policy which, at that time, was developing new models of service organization as a
result of the changes brought about by the Integrated Health Actions (AIS - 1983) and
subsequently by the SUDS and the SUS (Unified Health System);
(ii)   the contradiction between the political will and bureaucratic resistance to change, in
which there was no room for initiative from the project managers;
(iii)  the contradiction between the relative abundance of external resources and the scarcity of
national counterpart funds, especially in the first years of operation of the project, which at
certain junctures delayed the disbursement of World Bank resources; and
(iv)  the contradiction between the great demand for human resources and their limited supply
for the technical implementation of the project in the State Health Secretariats.
Without these contradictions the final performance of the project would have been better.
Il    Performance of the Brazilian Government in the Execution of the PNE I
The Government's performance in the execution of the PNE I is characterized by the low
priority assigned to the project by various sector echelons and agencies both at the Federal and at
the State levels, especially up to 1994.
At the Federal level, there were frequent cuts in the budgets submitted by the Ministry of
Health for the project, and especially in the national counterpart funds for which the Federal
Government was responsible. On various occasions these funds were not approved. On the
others, there were bureaucratic difficulties in their disbursement. At one point, there was even
talk of cancellation of the project since it was considered to be exclusively a matter for the State
governments. The irregular timing of disbursements by the Finance Ministry also tended to
discredit the project's purposes and cast doubt over its objectives. Other factors were: (i) the
absence of more effective involvement of the permanent structures of the Health Ministry in the
effort to achieve the PNE's objectives; (ii) the retention of project funds for longer than legally
permitted in order to cover other obligations of the Health Ministry; and (iii) the excessive
bureaucratic delays and protracted negotiations of additional conditions that resulted in
documents being forwarded after their period of validity. Finally, on some occasions, there was a
lack of political decisions which delayed the implementation of routine contractual obligations,
such as performance of annual independent audits of the project.
At the State level, there was an apparent lack of interest in the project, at times on the part
of the State Health Secretariats who viewed the project as a vertical activity and quite separate
from the permanent structure of the agency. The PNE I funds were the preferred source for many
State agencies when they sought to finance their sector activities, but this priority was not applied



23
to improving management methods and project implementation. There was a low level of
political coordination between the various State agencies involved in the project's execution. The
administrative procedures required by the project were not properly observed. The insufficiency
of management instruments led to persistent delays in the provision of accounts and a lack of data
on the monitoring of accomplishment of physical targets. Finally there were difficulties in
carrying out the bidding process, especially in certain States where the necessary funds had to be
deposited in advance in a bank account before the bidding process could be set in motion.
International competitive bidding was not organized until the last quarter of the PNE project
period.
III.   Performance of the World Bank
Like the majority of the government agencies, the World Bank also did not assign
sufficient priority, up to 1994, to the implementation of the Northeast Project. Rigid bureaucratic
control of the majority of the project actions led to disagreements that were difficult to resolve
regarding the roles of the financial agent and the borrower. In principle, the borrower should be
responsible to comply with the obligations assumed, and provide the means for the best use of the
loan funds. This does not mean blindly following the Bank's control requirements, which in many
instances brought the project to a halt. The financial agent should be responsible for monitoring
the accomplishment of the project's objectives through supervision and systematic monitoring of
the evolution of these goals. In this case, there was an excessive concern about the control of
expenditures made, which constrained the decision-making authority of the project managers.
In other words, the World Bank, as financial agent, also acted in a contradictory manner
with respect to the project, with excessive rigidity up to 1989 and then laxity in the early 1990s.
The balance between rigidity and flexibility was only achieved as of 1995, when adjustments were
made to the project. These enabled full utilization of the loan funds and full respect of the
technical criteria and the requirements of the Loan Agreement, for application of the existing
balances, something which seemed impossible under the circumstances prevailing up to 1994.
In any event, the World Bank, during the execution of the PNE I, had to handle the
contradiction between being a development bank and a development agency. This contradiction
is apparent between the need to approve the project and release the funds, on the one hand, and
the need to ensure that the funds are used in accordance with criteria that will ensure the
maximum benefit to the population. When the latter conditions proved difficult to meet, the
former situation prevailed since the return on investments in Bank projects is secure and involves
very little risk, as few governments fail to repay the Bank on time and in accordance with the
terms of the loan.

IV.   Measures Taken Jointly by the Government and the Bank to Improve Project
Performance.
1.    The following measures were taken:
(i)   as from early 1995, the Ministry of Health gave strong political support to the project,
underlined with the states the importance of the project which helped support the
Government's health strategy in the Northeast; it also emphasized to the states the
negative impact that could have an incomplete project implementation on the
Government's perspectives of future borrowing;
(ii)  the PCU was restructured and became directly responsible to the Secretaria de Asistencia
a Saude and was directly supervised by the Minister's Chief of Cabinet;
(iii)  project funds were included and programmed as an integral part of each state's budget;
this led to a better programming of counterpart funds required;
(iv)   state project units were restructured and became directly responsible to the State Minister
of Health; this increased the strategic importance of the project which became an essential
part of states' actions in the health sector;
(v)   the procurement process was strengthened and procurement schedules were regularly
monitored; consultants specialized in procurement were contracted to provide assistance
to states' procurement commissions in the preparation of bidding documents, technical
specifications for goods or services to be procured, bid evaluation, and required reports;
(vi)   a new management system was designed to monitor states' statements of expenditures,
follow up the project's disbursements in each state, identify delays and administrative and
financial bottlenecks at an early stage before they could negatively affect the project's
financial performance;
(vii)  the supervision of states' performance was intensified; states were classified in three
categories based on an assessment of the quality of project management and level of
political support; lower-scoring states received more supervision;
(viii)  investments to be undertaken under the project were reprogrammed to: (a) improve the
quality of regional and peri-urban hospitals in function of changes in population and
epidemiological profile; (b) include a small but important part of environmental health
investments; and (c) respond to the urgent needs of a number of municipalities not
originally contemplated in the project;
(ix)   consequently, funds were reallocated between categories in the Loan Agreement;



25
(x)   the PCU transmitted documents more promptly to the latter gave quicker replies to no-
objection requests,
(xi)  agreements were signed directly with a number of municipalities (with the approval of the
respective state); as a result, municipalities played a larger role in project implementation
and became more committed; also, in specific cases when the state faced difficulties, they
provided a portion of counterpart funds required by the project; and
(xii)  the PCU agreed with the National Treasury that the latter would liberate funds as required
for project implementation, and
V.    Project Impact
Despite the project's slow implementation, funds were totally disbursed and the project
had a positive impact on the health systems of the four states. The main benefits of the project
have been:
(i)    an increase in coverage of the health system in areas not previously adequately attended,
thus improving the population's access to basic health services;
(ii)   an improvement in physical infrastructure and equipment, resulting in a positive impact on
the quality of services provided to patients spontaneously demanding services or to those
induced by social marketing to follow health controls and checkups;
(iii)   a significant expansion in the development of human resources, both through the training
of middle-level staff working in health units and higher-level staff responsible for the
implementation of the SUS or the management of large hospitals; and
(iv)   an improvement in the health status of the population and the reduction of infant mortality,
this is the result of a variety of economic and social factors, including health. Measures
taken under the project contributed unequivocally to reduce infant mortality rates in the
four states covered by the project.
VI.   General Recommendations. In negotiations to obtain external resources, various sector
agencies are involved to ensure that the commitments assumed will not be beyond the
government's capacity. In project implementation, however, finding solutions for operating
difficulties encountered tends to be considered the exclusive responsibility of the project staff, as
if some higher ruling exempted the other governmental agencies from involvement. It is as if the
negotiations and implementation processes were mutually exclusive. As a result, different cycles
appear to be established in the political and administrative procedures and sector agencies do not
collaborate adequately with each other in project implementation.
Good financial performance on the part of a project is not sufficient to ensure its success,
although it is indeed an important aspect to be taken into consideration. Consistency of the



26
expenditures made with the scope of the objectives reached is what must be sought in analyzing
project performance. This will ensure efficiency in the utilization of the financial resources
allocated and effectiveness in achieving the end objectives set. However, efficiency in financial
performance must not be the justification for committing the available resources or for acting
inconsistently to demonstrate good performance in the use of external loans.
Finally, to obtain effectiveness, efficiency and rationality in projects financed with external
resources, greater administrative flexibility must be provided to the national decision-makers, at
all management levels. Vertical programs with limited relation to the organizational structure in
which the projects have to operate must be avoided. International agencies must give greater
decision-making  autonomy  regarding  bureaucratic  procedures  required  for  project
implementation. Performance indicators must be established that will enable reallocation of
resources among executing agencies so as to improve chances of achieving project objectives.
National counterpart funding must be given priority for these projects.
VII.  Specific Recommendations
*  Creation of a permanent system for submission of accounts, and monitoring and evaluation of
the financial performance of projects executed on a decentralized basis;
*  Implementation of a system for monitoring the accomplishment of the States' physical goals
that will enable operational evaluation of the goals and activities involved;
*   Streamlining and monitoring of the bidding processes;
*  Loan agreements providing more flexibility, greater decision-making and management
autonomy for borrowers regarding operations.
Offering of seminars for training in the technical support and administrative areas involving
aspects of international relations and law and their correlation with Brazilian public law,
*  Modification of the methodology for submission of accounts, with definition of a single
instrument that will meet the requirements of the Bank and of national agencies;
*  Reduction of the volume of financial data sent to the World Bank, organized by major
expenditure items, with greater autonomy for national managers to reallocate resources as
they deem necessary;
*   A Special Account set up for executing agents operating on a decentralized basis, with
differentiated ceilings that reward better performance;
*   Creation of a revolving reserve fund for payment emergencies that would be under the direct
management of the responsible agency;



27
Review the criteria for borrower's counterpart funds to allow states and municipalities to
contribute in accordance with their socioeconomic capacity;
*  Faster response by the World Bank in matters for which prior review by the Bank is a
requirement.
