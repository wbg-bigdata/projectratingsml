REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA FOR A BONG COUNTY
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Liberia for the equivalent of US$7.0 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance an agricultural development project in
Bong County. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
is making a parallel loan of US$6.0 million 1/; the USAID loan would have a
term of 40 years, including 10 years of grace, with 2% interest during
the grace period and 3% during the following 30 years.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A basic economic mission visited Liberia in March 1973.    Its
report "Liberia: Growth with Development - A Basic Economic Report" (No.
426a-LBR dated March 1, 1975) was distributed to the Executive Directors.
An updating report entitled "Liberia: Economic Memorandum" (No. 873-LBR
dated September 15, 1975) has also been distributed subsequently. An eco-
nomic mission visited Liberia in November/December, 1976 to review the Four-
Year Development Plan (1976-80) and its report is in preparation. Country
data sheets are contained in Annex I.
Structural Characteristics
3.        The growth of Liberia's economy remainc heavily dependent on the
performance of the enclave sector consisting mainly of: (a) iron ore mines,
(b) rubber plantations, and (c) forestry concessions. These enclaves are
the main source of export earnings and contribute an important share of gov-
ernment revenues. Iron ore mining is by far the largest single activity in
the enclave sector, accounting for about one third of gross domestic prod-
uct at factor cost. There are only limited linkages between the enclaves
and the rest of the economy; as a result, the benefits of economic growth
have been unevenly distributed. Annual repatriation by foreigners of
profits and savings is equivalent to about 20% of gross domestic product.
4.        At the other extreme, traditional agriculture has minimal inter-
action with the monetized economy; however, it supports the majority of
the population -- as much as 70%. With a population of about 1.5 million,
average per capita GNP in 1975 was US$410; about 4% of Liberians have per
capita income levels of US$3,000 or more, while the majority live at or near
subsistence level with income of about US$100 per annum. To help redress
1/   USAID is currently considering increasing its contribution to US$7.5
million. See also footnote, page 9.

this imbalance the Government is trying to increase its earnings from the
concessions and use the resources to diversify the economy with increased
participation by Liberians.
Development Plan
5.        The Government has recently prepared a Four-Year Development Plan
covering the period July 1, 1976 to June 30, 1980. In preparing the Plan
the Government was assisted by a planning team financed jointly by the Bank,
United Nations Development Program (UNDP), United States Agency for Interna-
tional Development (USAID) and the Government (Reference President's Memoran-
dum to the Executive Directors, No. R74-61 dated March 25, 1974). The Plan
identifies the basic, long-term objectives of Liberia's socio-economic develop-
ment as: (a) diversification of production; (b) dispersion of sustainable
socioeconomic activities throughout the country; (c) greater involvement of
Liberians in development activities; and (d) equitable distribution of the
benefits of economic growth so as to ensure an acceptable standard of living
for the people throughout the country. The average annual growth of real
GDP during the Plan period is envisaged at around 6.8%. However, because
of delays in the implementation of expected investments in iron ore mining
and some slackening in demand for the country's main exports, the recent Bank
economic mission has estimated that real growth during the four-year period
is unlikely to exceed 3-4%. Total development expenditure is projected at
US$415 million, of which US$251 million would be financed from foreign
sources and US$164 million domestically. Firm commitments accounted at
the start of the Plan for almost 60% of the expected foreign financing.
6.        The Development Plan attaches high priority to agriculture, partic-
ularly integrated rural development, as the cornerstone of the Government's
diversification strategy. The objective is to diversify and modernize agri-
cultural production, increase productivity, improve associated rural economic
activities such as marketing and processing, and provide social and physical
infrastructure to improve the quality of life in the rural areas where most
Liberians live.
Recent Economic Developments
7.        During 1973-1975 Liberia, like most other developing countries,
was hit by higher import prices and international inflation. While strong
world demand for Liberia's major export, iron ore, brought large gains in
export prices in 1974, the 1975 recession in the industrialized countries
significantly reduced the demand for the country's most important export
commodities -- iron ore, rubber and timber. With growth performance con-
tinuing to be largely a function of enclave activities, growth of real GDP
-- which averaged about 6.4% a year in the 1967-1970 period has slowed
down significantly and is estimated to be about 2.5% in 1976.



8.        Liberia has had a long history of sound fiscal management and public
sector resources have not come under undue pressure during the past decade.
A satisfactory growth in government revenues averaging about 13.5% per year
between 1970-1975 enabled the Government to finance increasing expendi-
tures. Recurrent expenditures during this period grew by about 10% while
development expenditures increased nearly fourfold. However, public sector
finances may come under increased pressure in the medium term mainly because
of an anticipated acceleration in the rate of growth of government expendi-
tures -- particularly current expenditure -- coupled with a more moderate rate
of growth in revenues. The rate of growth of government revenues is likely to
be moderate in view of the anticipated lower GDP growth rate as well as the
uncertain future of the world demand for iron ore and the fluid state of the
current negotiations between the Government and the iron ore companies regard-
ing the Government's share in profits and future dividend distribution poli-
cies.
Balance of Payments
9.        During the 1964-1972 period, the value of merchandise exports grew
by 10% and imports by 5.9% annually in current prices. Thereafter, from
1972-74, mostly reflecting accelerated international inflation, imports
rose by 29% annually, exceeding the 22% annual export growth. Oil imports
increased from US$12 million in 1972 to US$56 million in 1974 but declined
to US$48 million in 1975 due to reduced mining activities. Nevertheless,
Liberia achieved a trade surplus of US$110 million in 1974, US$63 million
in 1975 and an estimated US$99 million for 1976. During 1975, Liberia re-
ceived aid commitments of US$93 million; US$82 million in loans and about
US$11 million in current transfers. The World Bank Group was the largest
donor in terms of commitments (43%). The other major donors were the United
States, Italy and the African Development Bank.
Creditworthiness
10.       Liberia's external public debt outstanding and disbursed was esti-
mated at about US$170 million as of December 1975. Debt service payments
as a proportion of exports of goods and non-factor services were estimated
at 5.1% in 1975 as compared to 5.7 and 7.7% for 1974 and 1972 respectively.
Debt service payments as a percentage of government revenues have also de-
clined from 24.3% in 1972 and 21.1% in 1974 to 17.3% in 1975. Both ratios
are projected to decline further in the next few years as the final portion
of the heavy debt incurred in the early 1960s is paid off. The Bank Group
share of the public debt outstanding and disbursed is presently about 16%
and, based on commitments of the aid agencies up to 1975, is projected to
increase to about 30% by 1980; as a proportion of public debt servicing
liability, the Bank Group share is projected to increase from its present
level of about 12% to about 35% in 1980.   Even with an expanded public bor-
rowing program, Liberia's debt service ratio through the 1980s is expected
to remain relatively modest unless there is an unexpected deterioration in
external conditions. It should be noted, however, that Liberia's exports are
highly concentrated in a few commodities (mainly iron ore and rubber) with



- 4 -
unstable world market prices. Given the country's satisfactory performance
in economic management and its modest debt service ratio, Liberia should be
regarded as creditworthy for a significant amount of Bank lending, blended
with some assistance from IDA.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LIBERIA
11.       The Bank has made 13 loans (including one Third Window loan) for
projects in Liberia totalling US$71.2 million; there have been 4 IDA credits
totalling US$17 million, and one technical assistance grant of US$200,000
for development planning. IFC has made two equity investments totalling
US$555,000 in the share capital of the Liberian Bank for Development and In-
vestment (LBDI). The Bank loans have been for roads, port expansion, power
and LBDI; IDA credits have been for education and agriculture. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments
as of February 28, 1977 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
12.       The objectives of Bank Group operations are:    (a) to help increase
the absorptive capacity of the economy and enable Liberians to take greater
initiatives in developing their own resources for the benefit of their own
people; (b) to support policies and programs leading to broader sharing of
the fruits of economic progress; (c) to help the Government in broadening
the economic base; and (d) to assist the Government in mobilizing develop-
ment resources from other external agencies.
13.       In line with the priorities established in the Government's Four-
Year Development Plan, the Bank plans to give increasing emphasis in its
lending program over the next few years to the agricultural sector. The
proposed project is designed to assist subsistence peasant farmers in the
central part of Liberia to diversify their production base and to increase
their productivity and income through the provision of an integrated package
of support services and infrastructures, similar to the earlier project being
implemented in the Lofa County (Credit 577-LBR). A project is being prepared
to assist small- and medium-size Liberian rubber farms in rehabilitating and
planting rubber trees which would involve a total of about 24,000 ha through-
out the country; also under preparation is a forestry development project
which would initiate a pulpwood plantation program and provide assistance to
the newly established Forestry Development Authority for better management
and development of Liberia's forest resources.
14.       In infrastructure, a water supply project is under preparation which
would extend the Monrovia water supply system and help strengthen the manage-
ment and finances of the Liberia Water and Sewerage Corporation. A fourth
highways project is also being considered which might include construction
and improvement of high priority sections of selected primary and secondary
roads, road maintenance and assistance to the domestic construction industry.
In the power sector, an interim power project is being prepared which would
include expansion of the Liberia Electricity Corporation's thermal power
generating facilities until feasibility studies have been completed for a
possible hydropower development. In the social sector, a third education



project has been appraised which would emphasize vocational and technical
training and is expected to be submitted to the Executive Directors in the
next few months.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
15.       Liberian agriculture is characterized by small, traditional farms
that comprise more than 90 percent of total agricultural holdings. The tradi-
tional sector is largely outside the monetized economy, located in areas
with minimal infrastructure and composed of farms where less than 4 ha are
cultivated each year, producing mostly subsistence crops such as rice and
cassava and some cash crops such as coffee, cocoa and sugar cane. There
is little or no adoption of modern innovation. The average income of the
traditional smallholder is about US$70 per capita, compared with a national
average of about US$410. Alongside the traditional agriculture, there are
foreign concessions principally engaged in large rubber plantations and log-
ging operations as well as Liberian-owned commercial farms producing mainly
rubber but increasingly expanding into coffee, cocoa, poultry and livestock.
16.       Agricultural output in 1975 totalled US$197 million of which US$71
million originated in the monetized sector composed of rubber (US$36 million),
coffee, cocoa, palm products, etc., and US$126 million in the subsistence
sector. Average growth of all agricultural output during 1964-74 has been
over 5% per annum in real terms. However, traditional agriculture grew at
only 2.4%, while increases in the output of foreign concessions and Liberian
owned commercial farms have been larger.
17.       Prior to 1971, the Government's role in the development of Liberian
agriculture was focused on the rubber and timber concessions and commercial
plantations, while problems relating to traditional agriculture and rural
poverty were largely neglected. In recent times, however, development of
non-enclave agriculture has been emphasized by the Government, budgetary
provisions have been increased (from 3.8% of total public expenditure in
1970 to 5.6% in 1976), and some policy changes introduced (e.g., new pricing
formulae for export crops, establishment of. price stabilization and agricul-
tural development funds, and support price for paddy).
18.       As stated in the Four-Year Development Plan, which earmarks about
one-fifth of total investment resources for the development of agriculture,
the Government's objectives for agriculture aim at diversifying and moderniz-
ing the sector. Two basic strategies have been adopted: (a) in the short
run, the Government seeks to achieve self-sufficiency in rice, the staple
food for Liberians, by increasing production of upland and swamp rice through
provision of improved seeds and fertilizers; (b) in the longer term, the Gov-
ernment aims to encourage farmers to move away from the traditional shifting
cultivation. The upland areas of Liberia are generally unsuitable for perma-
nent cultivation of annual crops due to low soil fertility and ecological
reasons. To regenerate soil fertility shifting cultivation is widely prac-
ticed with fallow periods ranging from five to ten years. However, the



- 6 -
ecological conditions of the upland areas are suitable for the profitable
cultivation of tree crops. The Government is, therefore, anxious to expand
tree crops, particularly coffee, cocoa and oil palm. The extent of tradi-
tional shifting cultivation could further be reduced by developing swamps
and other low land areas for semi-permanent cultivation of rice. While
swamp rice currently accounts for less than 10% of total rice production
and has received relatively little attention, its long-term potential for
development is very encouraging.
19.       In order to implement the above strategies, the Government envisages
three different types of projects: (a) integrated rural development projects
whereby productivity, income and living conditions of the small traditional
farmers would be improved by providing a range of farm support services and
infrastructural improvements; (b) establishment of large plantation for oil
palm, sugar cane, coconut and rice by public sector corporations; and (c) im-
plementation of on-going special projects featuring mechanical land develop-
ment and subsequent cultivation of cleared areas by smallholders with support
services provided by the Government. Under the Four-Year Development Plan,
allocations of US$22 million for integrated rural development projects, US$33
million for large-scale farming and US$16 million for special projects have
been made. It is apparent that the special projects under (c) above reflect
the Government's desire to rapidly increase agricultural output and offset
the labor shortage. However, experience with such mechanized projects has
raised doubt about their economic viability: fully mechanized land develop-
ment has proved to be expensive and has caused serious damage to the fragile
top soil. One such project is being implemented by the Government in the
Kpartawee clan area, which is within the boundary of the proposed project.
The Government has agreed that after June 30, 1977 it would not engage in
any new large-scale mechanized land clearing activities for tree crop devel-
opment in the project area until the proceeds of the proposed credit have
been fully employed (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 5.01).
20.       One of the major constraints to the development of smallholder
agriculture in Liberia is the serious inadequacy of the agricultural credit
facilities. The only institutional (and extremely limited) sources of small-
holder credit have been the Cooperative, Credit and Marketing Division of
the Ministry of Agriculture and the Liberian Produce Marketing Corporation,
a wholly-owned Government corporation engaged primarily in marketing and ex-
tension of coffee, cocoa and oil palm. The Government is aware of the need
for expanding and streamlining smallholder credit operations and is consider-
ing establishment of a comprehensive agricultural credit system. The Govern-
ment has agreed that by June 30, 1977 it would prepare, for consultation with
the Association, a proposal for the establishment of an agricultural credit
system in Liberia, and within six months thereafter it would prepare, for
consultation with the Association, a detailed plan for implementation of
such proposal (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 4.06). The Mar-
keting Corporation has recently introduced a program of providing free tree
crop seedlings and a cash grant of US$30 per month for tree maintenance to
farmers participating in the Government's special projects which include
the Kpartawee area in Bong County as mentioned in paragraph 19 above. Such
a policy is not considered to be consistent with efficient management and
use of resources and in the long run could impose undue burden on the Gov-
ernment's finances, besides hindering development of appropriate credit



institutions. The Government has agreed that, after September 30, 1977,
pricing of inputs and the terms of credits provided by the Government to
farmers in the Kpartawee clan area would be made consistent with those
under this project (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 5.02).
21.       An integrated smallholder development project using concepts and
techniques similar to those of the proposed project is being implemented in
the Lofa County of Liberia, financed jointly by IDA (under Credit 577-LBR,
Lofa County Agricultural Development Project) and USAID. The project is
assisting about 8,000 small farmers in Lofa County to increase and diversify
production of upland and swamp rice, coffee and cocoa by providing credit,
inputs and extension services as well as by strengthening physical and social
infrastructures required for smallholder development. There was an initial
delay in implementing the Lofa project due to difficulties in recruitment of
key project staff. However, the Lofa project is now fully staffed and is
being implemented satisfactorily, although it is too early to make a full
assessment of its performance. The project has received necessary coopera-
tion and support from the Government agencies and there has been a positive
response from the project farmers. In designing the proposed project for
Bong County, special care has been taken to ensure that there is no similar
delay in the start-up of the project. Accordingly, the key project staff
(i.e., Project Manager and Financial Manager) have already been appointed
and the Association has granted an advance under the Project Preparation
Facility to help finance essential project start-up activities.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       The proposed project was identified by the Government and prepared
by consultants, Agrar-und-Hydrotechnik (Germany), financed under the Liberia
Agricultural Development and Technical Assistance Project (Credit 306-LBR).
The Government requested IDA and USAID assistance in financing the proposed
project and a joint IDA/USAID team appraised the project in May, 1976. A
report entitled "Liberia: Bong County Agricultural Development Project,"
No. 1307a-LBR dated February 11, 1977, is being circulated separately to
the Executive Directors. A credit and project summary is presented in
Annex III. Negotiations took place in Washington December 6-10, 1976.
The Liberian negotiating team was led by Mr. Louis A. Russ, Minister of
Agriculture.
Project Objectives
23.       The principal objective of the project is to increase the farm
income and improve the quality of life of subsistence farm families in the
Bong County, who live on average holdings of about 2 ha and have an average
per capita income of about US$68. The smallholders in the project area (about
19,000 farm families) employ traditional farming methods; farm management and
husbandry practices are poor, and there are virtually no modern innovations,
resulting in low productivity and standards of living at or below subsistence
level. The project would introduce for the first time in the area a package
of relatively simple and inexpensive technology combined with a set of farm
support services and essential infrastructural improvements. Together, they



- 8 -
are designed to induce and enable the target population to adopt innovations
and attain higher production and farm incomes through diversification of their
production. It is estimated that about 9,000 farm families in the project
area would participate in the farm and crop development program under the
project. Experience with similar projects in West Africa has shown that,
within the constraints of finance, management and, in particular, the exten-
sion service, not more than 40 to 50 percent of the area farm families
would participate in the project technical program. Also, in order to en-
sure continuity of farm support services initiated by the project, existing
national and local institutions would be strengthened and new ones establi-
shed. The project would be implemented over a five-year development period
1977/78-1981/82.
24.       The Lofa project, as well as the project under consideration here,
form an integral part of a comprehensive rural development program being
launched by the Government in accordance with the national development pol-
icy embodied in the Four-Year Development Plan. Both projects mark the be-
ginning of a conscious effort by the Government to involve the rural poor
in the national development effort and to bring about a more equitable dis-
tribution of the benefits of economic growth.
Project Content
25.       Farm and Crop Development - The project would lead to increased
production on about 6,000 ha of upland rice, 2,000 ha of swamp rice, 3,000
ha of cocoa and 1,500 ha of coffee. To achieve the increased production,
the project would provide: (a) farm inputs (improved seeds and seedlings,
fertilizers, insecticides, farm equipments, hired labor) on the basis of
credit operated under a revolving credit scheme; (b) extension services,
which include technical advice on farm management and crop production,
assistance to farmers in the selection of appropriate soils for different
crops and, where required, in land clearing and land development and farmer
training; and (c) assistance in improving on-farm processing of coffee and
cocoa, and marketing of crops.
26.       Physical Infrastructure - The project would include (a) construction
of about 170 km of new farm-to-market roads, reconditioning an existing 130
km and maintaining 540 km; (b) construction of offices, stores and houses;
(c) expansion of a training center and related facilities at Suakoko; and
(d) construction of about 300 village wells for supply of improved drinking
water for residents of the project area.
27.       Institutional Support - The project would include (a) the estab-
lishment of farmer cooperatives to facilitate input, credit supply and mar-
keting; (b) the establishment of the Bong County Project Management Unit
(BPMU) for project implementation and to train Liberian staff in technical
and managerial fields to strengthen the local capability to implement agri-
cultural projects; (c) assistance to the Liberian Bank for Development and
Investment (LBDI) for establishing banking facilities in the project area to
provide customary banking services to local residents; (d) improved research
facilities and capabilities at the Central Agricultural Experiment Station at



Suakoko; (e) the promotion of smallholder land registration; (f) assistance
to the Ministry of Health in the surveillance of schistosomiasis, which is
endemic in the country, in the project area; and (g) strengthening the Moni-
toring and Evaluation Unit established under the Ministry of Agriculture for
monitoring and evaluation of the project.
28.       Technical Assistance - The project would include the employment
of consultants for (a) preparation of an integrated agricultural develop-
ment project, tentatively identified in Grand Gedah County; (b) a survey
to explore the potential of a citrus processing indugtry in Liberia; (c) a
detailed study on the reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture; and
(d) a study on agricultural research requirements, including organizational
arrangements. This technical assistance would require about 70 consultant
man-months with an estimated average man-month cost of about US$5,000.
Project Cost and Financing
29.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$20.3 million (which
includes about US$0.2 million of indirect taxes but excludes other taxes and
import duties) during the five-year development period, 1977/78-1981/82. The
foreign exchange component is estimated at US$9.8 million (48% of the total
project cost). IDA would contribute US$7.0 million, USAID US$6.0 million 1/
and the Government US$7.3 million which represent 34%, 30% and 36% of the
total cost, respectively. The IDA credit of US$7.0 million would finance
US$5.4 million (or 55%) of foreign cost and US$1.6 million (or 15%) of local
cost. The USAID Loan would finance US$4.4 million (or 45%) of foreign cost
and US$1.6 million (or 15%) of local cost. The IDA credit would be on stan-
dard terms and the USAID loan would be for 40 years, including 10 years grace,
repayable in 30 equal annual installments with interest at 2% during the grace
period and 3% thereafter. Signing of the USAID loan agreement by the Govern-
ments of USA and Liberia would be a condition of effectiveness of the credit
(draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 7.01). The following tables
summarize project costs and their financing:
1/   The USAID is currently considering increasing its contribution to US$7.5
million. An increase in the U.S. contribution would be used to finance
additional local costs and reduce the Government contribution by a
proportionate amount.

30.       The main project items to be financed by IDA are internationally
recruited staff, vehicles, vehicle operating costs, buildings, equipment,
research improvements, development of banking facilities and consultants for
feasibility studies. USAID will finance mainly farm inputs (fertilizers,
insecticides, seeds, farm equipment, etc.) and farm-to-market roads. Items
to be procured under the USAID loan would be competitive with world market
prices.
31.       In order to expedite initial implementation of the project, an
advance of up to US$200,000 has been granted under the Project Preparation
Facility. The advance would finance expenditures required prior to effec-
tiveness of the proposed credit in connection with project startup activities,
e.g., construction of staff houses, office buildings, recruitment of key ex-
patriate staff, and vehicles. In accordance with normal terms and conditions
of advances granted under the Facility, the advance and the service charge
thereon will be fully repaid to IDA through reimbursement under the proposed
credit as soon as it becomes effective.



Project Implementation
32.       The Bong Project Management Unit (BPMU) would be established at
Suakoko as a semi-autonomous entity of the Ministry of Agriculture with
sole responsibility for implementing the project. BPMU would consist of
five divisions: agricultural services; cooperative and credit services;
training; finance; and administration. The project would be staffed by
qualified local staff whenever possible, but because of shortage of experi-
enced Liberians, certain key positions may have to be filled by expatriates.
Accordingly, funds would be provided for the international recruitment of a
Project Manager, Managers of the Finance, Agricultural Services, Training and
Cooperative and Credit Services divisions, a Swamp Development Officer and a
Land Use Planning Officer. These positions would be filled by persons having
qualification and experience, and on terms and conditions, satisfactory to IDA
(draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.01(c)). All expatriate staff
would have an additional responsibility for training their Liberian counter-
parts so that the latter may take over management of the project toward the
end of the development period.
33.       The Project Steering Committee composed of the Ministers of Agri-
culture (Chairman), Finance, Planning, Local Government and Rural Develop-
ment as members, and the Project Manager of BPMU as secretary, would be
established, to determine project policy, exercise budgetary control and
ensure interministerial coordination at the national level in the execution
of the project. Coordination and cooperation among tribal heads and local
leaders in the project area would be achieved through the Project Consulta-
tive Committee which would include the County Superintendent (Chairman),
paramount chiefs of the six chiefdoms, heads of the local branches of var-
ious governmental agencies, chairmen of the farmer cooperatives, and the
Project Manager and Deputy Manager of BPMU.
34.       The Ministry of Public Works would be responsible for implementing
the farm-to-market road component of the project through a special unit to
be created within the Ministry. The surveillance of schistosomiasis would
be through a special unit established under the Ministry of Health, which
would cover both the Bong and Lofa Projects. These units would operate in
close liaison with BPMU in all phases of their work. An assurance has been
given by the Government that, in the event of a marked increase in schis-
tosomiasis in the project area, the Government would promptly institute
preventative and curative measures (draft Development Credit Agreement,
Section 3.09(b)).
35.       A study on the reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture car-
ried out under the Agricultural Development and Technical Assistant Project
(Credit 306-LBR) has been completed by consultants. The consultants' re-
port, which is currently under review by the Government and IDA, recommends
that a semi-autonomous Rural Development Authority be established as an
agency responsible for smallholder agricultural development. However, the
study was not intended to provide the details required for implementation



- 12 -
of the reorganization proposals and further work is required on such matters
as job descriptions, position classification and cost estimates. In view of
the urgent need for creating an adequate institutional framework that would
ensure continued support services to project farmers during the post devel-
opment phases of this and other projects being developed within the agricul-
tural sector, funds would be provided under the proposed credit for a fol-
low-up study designed to provide more detailed proposals for reorganization,
including the specifics of implementation.
Training
36.       The project would provide for the training of all extension, coop-
erative and credit field staff recruited by BPMU by a combination of short
courses interspersed with practical field instruction. The project would also
provide overseas training of selected Liberian staff in coffee and cocoa as
well as training in project management and rural development administration
for senior Liberian staff of BPMU. Farmer training would be organized on
village demonstration farms, at farmer training centers attached to the six
zonal offices of BPMU and through farm visits. Upon completion of the proj-
ect, field staff trained uLnder the project but not needed for maintenance
of the project would be transferred to other counties where there is a big
demand for, but serious lack of, trained extension workers.
Agricultural Credit, Input Supply and Marketing
37.       Under the project, farmer cooperatives which would be responsible
for delivery of farm inputs and credit and for providing improved marketing
facilities to project farmers would be established. However, until this is
done, BPMU's Cooperative and Credit Services Division would arrange for these
services.
38.       A revolving credit fund would be established under an agreement
between the Government and the Liberian Bank for Development and Investment
(LBDI), the latter acting as administrator of the fund. LBDI would lend
to the farmer cooperatives which, in turn, would advance credits to project
farmers. Individual credit applications would be screened by a credit advis-
ory committee consisting of the village or clan chief and BPMU cooperative
staff. Two types of credits would be provided under the project:
(a) Development loans would be available to cover costs of
developing coffee and cocoa (seedlings, fertilizers,
land development service, hand tools, processing equip-
ment, etc.) and swamp rice (hired labor for construction
of water control and storage structures, pedal threshers,
etc.). Loans for coffee and cocoa development would be
repaid in 12 years, including a 4-year grace period, and
would bear interest at 10% per annum. Loans for swamp
rice development would be repaid in 8 years, including a
2-year grace period, and would bear interest at 10% per
annum.



- 13 -
(b)  Seasonal loans would be available (with an average
maturity of about 8 months) to cover costs of seasonal
inputs for rice, coffee and cocoa (improved rice seeds,
fertilizer, agricultural chemicals, spraying service,
etc.) and would be repayable at harvest with a flat 10%
service charge.
A Revolving Credit Fund Agreement, satisfactory to the Association, would be
entered into between the Government and LBDI not later than June 30, 1977,
and would provide for smallholder credit to be made available on the terms
agreed with the Government (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 4.05
(a) and Section 4.05 (f)). The revolving credit fund would charge farmer co-
operatives 7% per annum on loans onlent to farmers at 10%, allowing a margin
of 3% for farmer cooperatives to cover the costs of administering loans and
bad debts. LBDI would receive a 2% commission on disbursed funds to cover
the cost of administering the revolving credit fund. At the end of project
development in 1982, the fund would have about US$570,000 and by 1995 all
development loans amounting to US$2.5 million would have been repaid and
made available for further agricultural development as determined by the
Revolving Credit Fund Agreement. The Government has agreed that, after
the completion of the project, the fund's capital would be used exclusively
for the purpose of smallholder credit operations (draft Development Credit
Agreement, Section 4.05 (d)).
39.       The supply of farm inputs would be organized and implemented ini-
tially by BPMU and later by the farmer cooperatives with assistance from BPMU
staff. The Liberian Produce Marketing Corporation would be responsible for
procuring farm inputs mainly through importation and for delivery to BPMU
or cooperative storage in the project area. Farmers would pay the full
delivered price for all inputs supplied. The Marketing Corporation would
be entitled to a 5% commission on the value of inputs plus transport costs.
The farmer cooperatives would receive a 5% fee to cover handling charges plus
local transport costs for delivery to farmers.
40.       As several thousand farmers who have so far had little or no ex-
perience with market production would have to be integrated into the mar-
keting system, an objective of the project would be improved marketing mech-
anisms and related infrastructural facilities. This would be achieved by
the creation of collection points where farmers would be paid full producer
prices set by the Government, the promotion of farmer cooperatives as mar-
keting intermediaries, the provision of market information service to farmers,
and the introduction of more efficient farm-to-market transport and storage
facilities.
41.       Liberia is not a major producer of coffee and cocoa and its cur-
rent exports are less than 0.2% of world production of each commodity. The
incremental coffee and cocoa output from the project would be insignifi-
cant in terms of total world production and would have no impact on world



- 14 -
prices. The International Coffee Organization and the International Cocoa
Organization have been consulted and they have no objection to the proposed
coffee and cocoa development, respectively, under the project.
Procurement and Disbursement
42.       Procurement contracts for vehicles, equipment for offices and
workshops, and other items valued at more than US$50,000 would be through
international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines. Domes-
tically manufactured goods would be allowed a 15% preference or the applicable
duty, whichever is lower, when comparing domestic bids with those of foreign
manufacturers. Contracts for items costing between US$5,000 and US$50,000
and civil works (office buildings and houses) would be awarded on the basis
of local competitive bidding in accordance with procedures satisfactory to
IDA. Contracts for items costing less than US$5,000 would be through cus-
tomary local procedures satisfactory to IDA. The aggregate value of procure-
ment under these procedures (i.e., international competitive bidding, local
competitive bidding and local customary procedures) is estimated at about
US$2.2 million.
43.       The IDA credit of US$7.0 million would be disbursed over the five
years 1977/78 to 1981/82. It would be disbursed against: (a) 100% of for-
eign expenditure for imported vehicles and equipment (other than farm equip-
ment and road building vehicles financed by USAID) or 90% of the total cost
if locally procured, totaling US$0.8 million; (b) 80% of the cost of buildings
and furnishings, totaling US$0.4 million; (c) 100% of foreign expenditure for
internationally recruited staff, consultants and overseas training of local
staff, totaling US$2.15 million; (d) 70% of expenditures for administration
and operating costs, the establishment of banking facilities, and materials
for village wells, totaling US$1.1 million; (e) 20% of expenditures for
local staff, excluding those financed by USAID, totaling US$0.6 million;
and (f) 100% of foreign expenditures and 50% of local expenditures for the
improvement of research and laboratory facilities, totaling US$0.45 million.
An amount of US$1.5 million would be unallocated.
Project Benefits and Risks
44.       The overall economic rate of return calculated on the basis of the
quantifiable part of incremental costs (86% of the project cost) and benefits
is estimated at 21%. At project maturity in 1990, direct benefits from the
project would be incremental production of about 8,700 tons of paddy rice,
3,000 tons of cocoa beans and 1,500 tons of clean coffee annually. From 1990,
the project would generate net foreign exchange earnings and savings of about
US$6.7 million annually through increased export of coffee and cocoa, and rice
import substitution. About 9,000 smallholder families with average holdings
of about 2 ha would benefit directly from increased production.    By 1990,
their average net family income is estimated to increase from the present
US$360 (US$68 per capita) to about US$850 (US$160 per capita) in real terms.
However, even this increased level of income would still be substantially
below the present national average per capita income of US$410 and the project



-  5 
farmers would still be poor. The project would cause substantial mobilization
of labor in the project area, particularly the seasonally unemployed and
underemployed.
45.       The project would have important secondary benefits for the com-
munity as a whole from improved roads, banking facilities, health services
and marketing system. Development of the cooperatives would create rural
capabilities for providing farm support services, which could benefit poten-
tially all the farm families in the project area. The project would also
strengthen the technical and managerial capabilities of the Agriculture
Ministry, resulting in improved planning and implementation of future rural
development projects.
46.       As in other rural development projects, the project's direct con-
tribution to Government revenue is minimal because there are no Government
taxes that can be applied; the present system of land taxation being com-
pletely inelastic to farm incomes. Nor can project beneficiaries be charged
for general technical services. However, there are likely to be substantial
increases in revenues to the Government from indirect taxes (sales tax, excise
duties) resulting from increased expenditure on imported and locally produced
goods. The Marketing Corporation, through increased market turnover, should
increase its revenue from coffee and cocoa by about 8% of FOB value annually,
and in addition would receive a 7% levy on project generated coffee and cocoa
for its agricultural development fund. Development loans made under the proj-
ect for farm inputs would be repaid and made available for further agricul-
tural development in Liberia.
47.       Smallholder agricultural development projects are inherently and
conceptually complex and subject to a number of potential risks and uncertain-
ties (e.g. inadequate coordination and cooperation among Government agencies).
However, the Government has demonstrated considerable commitment to the
development of smallholder agriculture and this has been confirmed by the
seriousness with which the Government is currently implementing the Lofa
project. Risks due to technical weaknesses have been minimized since the
technological packages are simple and have already been successfully tested in
Liberia as well as elsewhere in West Africa.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Liberia and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association
and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
49.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of Annex
IV of this Report. Signing of the USAID loan agreement of US$6 million and
the appointment of the Manager of the Agricultural Services division of BPMU
would be additional conditions of effectiveness of the Credit Agreement. A



- 16 -
condition of credit disbursement against the cost of improving research
facilities (except for expenses in respect of continuation of rice research
initiated under Credit 306-LBR) would be that the Association has approved
the proposals for the reorganization of agricultural research referred to in
paragraph 28 above.
50.        I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
51.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 617-LBR     Port Development Project:   US$3.6 million Loan of June 20,
1969; Effective Date: July 10, 1969; Closing Date:
March 31, 1977
Project execution has been satisfactory. The Bank has agreed to
the Government's request that funds still undisbursed be used to help finance
an overall study of port development needs in Liberia, which was stipulated
in the project. Government signed a contract in May 1974 for the first
phase of port development study, which was completed in September 1975.
As a result, proposals were invited from consultants for further field
studies of the hydrographic conditions of the Port of Monrovia. These
proposals are under consideration by the Port Authority and the Bank with
the view to starting the studies later in 1977. We expect the loan closing
date to be extended to cover the next phase of the studies. The Government
is currently formulating a formal request for such extension and the matter
will be resolved shortly.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 1150-LBR    Power Project:  US$1.8 Million Loan of August 1, 1975;
Effective Date: October 20, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979
The project finances technical assistance for establishing a long-
range development plan and detailed investment program as well as for strenth-
ening the management of the Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) and training
its staff. Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily, although the
training program needs to be expanded to include practical training for middle-
level staff. The financial performance of the utility is stationary and needs
improving to achieve agreed financial targets. The Board of Directors recently
replaced the Managing Director with another Liberian. Some further changes in
LEC's senior management can be anticipated in the next few months since some
of the expatriates' contracts will expire.
Credit No. 306-LBR Agricultural Projects: US$1.2 Million Credit of May 17,
1972; Effective Date: December 8, 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977; and
Credit No. 577-LBR US$6 Million Credit of August 1, 1975; Effective Date:
May 26, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Under the first credit, feasibility reports on three agricultural
projects and a consultant's study on the reorganization of the Ministry of
Agriculture have been completed, but construction of the training center is
behind schedule. Project completion date has been revised from June 30, 1976
to August 31, 1977. A second credit, approved in 1975, is now in execution.
There was an initial delay in implementing the project due to the delay in
recruitment of key project staff. However, the project is now fully staffed
and is being implemented satisfactorily, although it is too early to make a
full assessment of its performance. The project has received necessary coop-
eration and support from the Government agencies and there has been a positive
response from the project farmers.
Loan No. 1055-LBR   Development Finance Company:   US$4 Million Loan of
December 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 3, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979; and
Loan No. 1323-LBR    US$7 Million Loan of October 7, 1976; Effective Date:
December 17, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The Loan 1055-LBR helped LBDI meet its financial requirements
through calendar year 1976. LBDI's loan approvals during calendar 1976
surpassed the projected level for the year. Commitments and disbursements
were similarly above targets. Disbursement of Bank funds, in particular, has
been faster than projected. The loan is fully committed and 65% disbursed as
of February 28, 1977. The Loan 1323-LBR, signed October 7, 1976, together
with recently secured third loan from the African Development Bank, would
cover LBDI's foreign resource gap for the period 1977 to 1979.

Loan No. 907-LBR    Highway Projects:   US$3.0 Million Loan of June 13,
1973; Effective Date: December 28, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977;
Credit No. 395-LBR  US$2.6 Million Credit of June 13, 1973; Effective Date:
December 28, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977; and
Loan No. 1156-LBR   US$27.5 Million Loan of August 28, 1975; Effective Date:
October 14, 1975; Closing Date: December 31,'1979
The project financed under Loan 907/Credit 395-LBR contains four
elements: (a) the design and reconstruction of the Monrovia By-Pass: this
is now substantially completed; (b) feasibility studies for the improvement
of three roads in the vicinity of Monrovia: all are now completed; on two
of the roads which are important links in the main highway network, recon-
struction has been demonstrated as amply justified and final design has been
started, aiming at completion by May 1977; (c) technical assistance in the
Government's four-year maintenance program: this is already showing bene-
fits in improved running surfaces on earth and gravel roads and plans are now
being made to consolidate the gains and develop them still further by closer
attention to the organization and planning of road maintenance; and (d) assis-
tance in determining how best to improve the efficiency of the local civil
engineering construction industry: a study has begun and should be completed
by mid-1977.
The project financed under Loan 1156-LBR contains four elements:
(a) the design and construction of a major bridge and of an urban main road
(5.4 mi.) in Monrovia and of a rural main road (83 mi.): construction has
started on all three and is proceeding somewhat hampered by an unusually
protracted rainy season in 1976; (b) consultant services for feasibility
studies of rural main roads and for an urban transport study in Monrovia:
negotiations are now proceeding with selected consultants; (c) establishing
a feeder road construction unit: Equipment was delivered in January 1977;
technical advisors provided by the U.K. are in post; and the unit is opera-
tional and has made a good start; and (d) technical assistance in building up
the planning department of the Ministry of Public Works: a Transport Planner
is now in post.
Credit No. 305-LBR Education Projects: US$7.2 Million Credit of May 17,
1972; Effective Date: December 18, 1972; Closing Date:
March 1. 1978; and
Loan No. 1266T-LBR US$4.0 Million Third Window Loan of June 7, 1976; Effec-
tive Date: July 8, 1976; Closing Date: October 31, 1980
The implementation of the first project has been slow due to diffi-
culties in selecting suitable architectural consultants, reaching agreement
on designs and following satisfactory bidding procedures for civil works.



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 5 pages
The problems have been resolved and implementation is now proceeding satis-
factorily. All of the construction contracts have been awarded; and the
project is expected to be completed by around March 1978, about six months
behind the original schedule.
Implementation of a second loan (on Third Window terms) is under-
way. Good progress is being made in design of buildings and selection of
technical assistance personnel. Recruitment of suitable candidates for
fellowships is proceeding more slowly. The first steps have been taken
towards preparation of equipment lists, purchase of vehicles and design of
furniture. The construction contract for the primary school units has been
awarded.

LIBERIA-BONG COUNTY AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Borrower:           Republic of Liberia
Credit Amount:      US$7.0 million
Terms:               Standard
Project
Description:        The project would assist about 9,000 small farmers in
the upper Bong County to develop about 6,000 ha. of
upland rice, 2,000 ha. of swamp rice, 3,000 ha. of
cocoa and 1,500 ha. of coffee through provision of farm
inputs on the basis of credit, extension services for
crop production and land development and assistance in
processing and marketing of crops. In addition the
project would: (a) construct or recondition 300 km
of farm-to-market roads and maintain 540 km; (b) es-
tablish farmer cooperatives; (c) help establish bank-
ing facilities in the project area; (d) improve agri-
cultural research facilities at Suakoko; (e) provide
schistosomiasis surveillance and construct 300 village
wells; (f) train Liberians and strengthen institutional
framework for agricultural development; and (g) provide
technical assistance for project preparation. The proj-
ect would establish a smallholder credit scheme to
provide: (a) development loans for coffee and cocoa
(repayable in 12 years including a 4-year grace period
with interest at 10% per annum) and for swamp rice (re-
payable in 8 years including a 2-year grace period with
interest at 10% per annum); and (b) seasonal loans (re-
payable at harvest with a flat 10% service charge).

Procurement
Arrangements:       Contracts for vehicles, equipments and similar items
valued at more than US$50,000 would be through interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guide-
lines with standard preference provision for locally
manufactured goods. Items costing between US$5,000
and US$50,000 and civil works would be through local
competitive bidding procedures acceptable to IDA. Con-
tracts for items costing less than US$5,000 would be
through customary local procedures satisfactory to IDA.
Appointments of all internationally recruited staff and
consultants would be through contracts satisfactory to
IDA. An advance of up to US$200,000 has been granted
under the Project Preparation Facility to finance items
needed for early implementation of the project, e.g.,
recruitment of key staff, construction of office space
and houses, vehicles and vehicle operations.
Technical
Assistance:         The project would include a feasibility study for a
third integrated agricultural development project tenta-
tively identified in Grand Gedah County; a detailed
study on reorganization of Ministry of Agriculture; a
study on Liberia's agricultural research requirements
and institutional arrangements and a small survey to
explore possibility of citrus industry in Liberia. The
above would involve about 70 consultant man-months.
Rate of
Return:              The estimated economic rate of return is 21%.
