APPRAISAL OF A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        A major socio-economic objective of the Malawi Government is to
reduce regional imbalances by promoting development in the northern half of
the country. The proposed project will support this objective by improving
part of the main road which links the northern part of the country with the
capital, Lilongwe, and with the more developed southern areas.
ii.       The project is directly related to work carried out under the First
and Second Highway Projects. The major component of the proposed project is
construction to bituminous standards of a 53-mi road between Kasungu and
Jenda to link with the road being constructed under the Second Highway Proj-
ect between Kasungu and Lilongwe. The project also provides: (i) for some
strengthening of two short lengths (totalling about 8 mi) of the Zomba-
Lilongwe road, constructed under the First Highway Project, and an adjoin-
ing section of about 4 mi, all of which have been affected by heavier than
expected traffic; and (ii) a feasibility study and, if justified, detailed
engineering of the Jenda-Mzuzu section of the north-south road, the only
section remaining to be improved after works currently in progress, or for
which financing is assured, are completed.
iii.      Total project cost is estimated at US$14.3 million excluding
taxes and duties of US$0.8 million, with a foreign exchange component of
US$9.3 million or 65%. The project will be financed by an IDA Credit of
US$10.5 million, which will cover 74% of total project cost net of taxes and
duties, a credit of US$1.8 million from the OPEC Special Fund, and a Govern-
ment contribution of US$2.0 million net of taxes and duties, representing
14% of the net project cost.
iv.       The Ministry of Works and Supplies will be responsible for project
implementation. The road construction and strengthening contracts will be
awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group
Guidelines for Procurement. Consultants will be employed under terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA. Road construction is expected to commence in
early 1978 and be completed by late 1979; the strengthening works will be
carried out during 1978.
V.        The proposed road works are economically sound, with an estimated
economic return of 14% for the Kasungu-Jenda road and 13% for strengthening
parts of the Zomba-Lilongwe road.
vi.       The project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$10.5 million to the
Government of Malawi on standard terms.

APPRAISAL OF A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Malawi has requested IDA assistance in financing
a highway project to further its transport development strategy of providing
all-weather access to the less developed central and northern regions, and
promoting the improvement and maintenance of lower class roads to facilitate
the transport of agricultural produce and access to public services in rural
areas.
1.02      The proposed project has evolved from a feasibility study (1972-73)
and detailed engineering (1973-74) financed by the United Nations Development
Programme, with the Bank as executing agency, and from previous IDA-financed
highway projects. Under the Second Highway Project, IDA is assisting in the
construction of the Lilongwe-Kasungu section of the north-south road. The
proposed project includes construction of the next section north from Kasungu
to Jenda (53 mi) and a feasibility study, followed, if justified, by detailed
engineering of the adjoining Jenda-Mzuzu section (about 110 mi), the only
section of the north-south road not covered by detailed engineering. The
proposed project also provides for strengthening two short lengths (t,-tal 8
mi) of the Zomba-Lilongwe section of the north-south road, financed unL-r the
First Highway Project and an adjoining section of about 4 mi; this streng.hen-
ing is necessary because of subgrade failure which has been exacerbated by
much heavier traffic than expected at appraisal (para. 4.05).
1.03      The project was originally intended to include extension of the
District Roads Improvement and Maintenance Program (DRIMP) initiated under the
Second Highway Project. However, it will now be possible to finance this
extension from savings under that Second Project.
1.04      This report is based on the above-mentioned studies and on the
findings of an appraisal mission which visited Malawi in February-March 1977,
comprising Messrs. S.O. Sigfusson (Engineer) and P.W. Blackshaw (Economist).
2. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Economic Setting
2.01      Malawi is a long, narrow, landlocked country situated in the Great
African Rift Valley. It has a land area of about 36,000 sq mi and a lake
area of 9,400 sq mi. Altitudes range from about 200 ft above sea level in
the Shire Valley in the south to over 8,000 ft in the northern plateau. A
major escarpment runs the length of the country, separating the Lake Malawi
plain (average altitude 1,500 ft) from the plateau to the west (average



altitude 4,500 ft). Most of the main rivers flow from west to northeast
across the country's transport axis into Lake Malawi. This topography
makes provision of transport facilities expensive in many parts of the coun-
try.
2.02      With a population of about five million, Malawi is relatively
densely populated by East African standards. Development in the country's
three administrative regions has been rather unbalanced. Until indepen-
dence in 1964, most development was concentrated in the Southern Region, which
had the only rail link, most of the all-weather roads, the administrative
capital of Zomba and the main commercial center of Blantyre. The much lower
level of development in the Central Region and, in particular, the Northern
Region, encourage a southward migration of population. Population density in
the Southern Region is still more than three times that of the Northern
Region, and almost three quarters of the total population lives in the
southern half of the country. One of the Government's main socio-economic
objectives, as set out in the Statement of Development Policies (1971) is to
promote more balanced regional development. To this end, it has moved the
administrative capital some 150 mi north from Zomba to Lilongwe, and has
initiated several agricultural development projects in the northern half of
the country, including major projects at Karonga and Viphya, and smaller
projects around Kasungu and Mzimba. Further development in these areas is
planned under the National Rural Development Program.
2.03      Since almost 90% of the population lives in rural areas, and agri-
culture contributes about 90% of Malawi's exports, rural development is
a primary social and economic objective. In addition to raising agricultural
productivity, it is seen as an effective vehicle for the Government's policy
of redistributing incomes in favor of the rural poor. Although the most
rapid increases in agricultural output in the past have been achieved by
private estates and discrete regional projects, Government is now directing
its agricultural program towards a minimum package approach to rural develop-
ment with a wider geographic coverage as epitomized in its National Rural
Development Program. Preliminary investments in that Program are being
supported by a Third Window Bank Loan No. 1286-T-thI,
2.04      Gross domestic product increased, in real terms, at the relatively
rapid rate of 6.5% per year over the period 1965-76.  Even so, per capita GNP
was US$150 in 1975, and Malawi is classified by the United Nations as one of
the least developed countries in the world.
B. The Transport System
2.05      The principal features of Malawi's transport system are a main
road network which is fairly well developed south of Lilongwe but very un-
developed in the northern half of the country; a largely underdeveloped lower
class road network; a rail system in the southern half of the country which is
primarily used for export-import and transit traffic; lake transport which
mainly serves the north and compensates to some extent for the undeveloped



- 3 -
land transport links; and air transport which is dominated by international
passenger traffic. Road transport dominates internal transport while most
export-import freight is carried by rail.
Highways
2.06      Some 977 mi (14%) of the approximately 6,820 mi of roads are paved,
and 369 mi (5%) are of engineered gravel standard; the rest, earth roads and
tracks. Road density is 184 mi per 1000 sq mi or 1.4 mi per 1000 inhabitants,
which is about average for East African countries. However, the very low
quality of most of the network results in high transport costs. Details
concerning highways and their administration are given in Chapter 3.
Railways
2.07      The main railway line extends from Salima in the Central Region,
through Blantyre, to the extreme southern border (277 mi) where it connects
with the line to the Mozambique port of Beira. A recently built branch line
(63 mi), offering an alternative route to the sea, extends eastward from
Nkaya to Nayuci, and connects with the Mozambique line to the port of Nacala
on the Indian Ocean. Rehabilitation of the older main line has been underway
during the last few years with British and Canadian aid and is expected to be
completed within the next six years. An extension westward from Salima to
Lilongwe (63 mi), financed by a grant from the Canadian Government, is nearing
completion and operations will commence early next year. The Canadian Govern-
ment has agreed to provide a grant for a further extension westward from
Lilongwe through Mchinji to the Zambian border (68 mi) with the ultimate aim
of linking with the Tanzania-Zambia Railway 1/.
2.08      In 1975, the railway carried about 1.4 million tons of freight
and about 1.2 million passengers. Despite some loss of traffic due to
increasing road competition, rail traffic in terms of ton-miles has grown
at an average rate of 7.5% annually since 1970, largely because of increased
export-import traffic. In 1975, it carried about 168 million ton-miles of
freight, about three quarters of which was import-export traffic or Zambian
transit traffic, which is trucked to and from rail heads in Malawi. The rail-
way appears to be run efficiently and earns a modest net operating surplus,
Lake Transport
2.09      Freight and passenger transport on Lake Malawi is provided by Lake
Services Limited, a subsidiary of Malawi Railways, and principally serves the
remote northern areas of the country. Traffic volumes are relatively light,
amounting to only about 35,000 tons of freight and some 148,000 passengers
in 1975. At present about 70% of the traffic is northbound, originating
at Chipoka which is served by the railway, but this pattern may change some-
what as the impact of ongoing rural development projects in the north is
1/   This would require construction of an approximately 200 mi link in
Zambia.

felt, notably the Karonga Rural Development Project; under this project, which
has been assisted by IDA and the Bank (Credit 282-MAI and Loan 1286-T-MAI), a
self-propelled barge has been procured and the Chipoka harbor is being im-
proved. In addition, lake transport will increase sharply if a proposed pulp
mill at Chinteche in the Northern Region is developed in connection with the
Viphya timber exploitation scheme; a study of the infrastructure needs of this
scheme is being financed by IDA Credit S-17-MAI. The Lake Service's operating
losses averaged US$62,000 per year over 1970-74, a considerable improvement on
the average loss of US$180,000 per year over the preceding five-year period.
However, cost pressures led to losses of about US$100,000 in 1975 and
US$200,000 in 1976.  Freight tariff increases averaging 18% were introduced in
May 1977 and are estimated to be sufficient for the service to cover operating
costs in 1978.
Air Transport
2.10      Air transport within Malawi is relatively unimportant compared
with the other modes, with only four airports (Chileka near Blantyre,
Lilongwe, Mzuzu and Karonga) served by scheduled services. Only the Chileka
airport can accommodate long range jet aircraft; it serves as the country's
international airport and is also the most important domestically because of
its proximity to commercial centers. Chileka accounted for over 80% of
Malawi's recorded passenger movements of 327,000 in 1975; 90% of passenger
movements at Chileka are international. Recently, the Government decided to
develop a second international airport at Lilongwe; its first construction
phase has been tendered and will be financed with assistance from the African
Development Bank. Total cost is presently estimated at US$50 million.
2.11      Air Malawi, a Government-owned airline, provides international
services and all scheduled domestic services. Six foreign airlines also
provide international services, and two local companies as well as Air
Malawi provide unscheduled domestic services.
C. Transport Policy and Coordination
2.12      Malawi's present transport policy has three broad aims:  (i) to
improve the administrative, social and economic integration of the country
by linking all three regions with reliable all-weather connections; (ii)
to support rural development by improving access to rural areas; and (iii)
to provide efficient links with transport routes to the Indian Ocean seaports
for exports and imports. To these ends the Government is undertaking an
extensive transport development program; numerous transport studies have been
carried out or are in progress and, as stated above, investments are planned
and underway in all transport modes. Overall sector priorities are laid out
in the Government's "Statement of Development Policies 1971-1980", and deter-
mined in more detail in a three-year rolling public sector investment program
which is revised annually during budget preparation. The transport sector
accounts for 46% of total planned capital expenditures of US$385 million over



the next three years, substantially higher than the 25% share which prevailed
during the five years to 1974/75. The increase is almost entirely due
to plar.ned expenditures of over US$50 million between 1977/78 and 1979/80 on
extension of the railway from Lilongwe to the Zambian border, and construction
of an international airport at Lilongwe. When these investments are com-
pleted, transport's share of Government's capital expenditure is expected to
revert to about its previous level. While the Association has reservations
about such investments (paras. 2.13, 2.15), the road program is generally
satisfactory (para. 3.10).
2.13      Institutional arrangements for coordination of transport investment
planning are adequate. This function is the responsibility of the Economic
Planning Division (EPD) of the Office of the President and Cabinet which
reviews proposals put forward by the Ministry of Works and Supplies (MWS) for
roads and the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC) for all other
modes. In practice, however, such coordination has been lacking because of
limited staff within the EPD, and the development of each mode has proceeded
almost independently of the others. Modal development has tended to be
complementary rather than competitive, but recent experience with rail invest-
ments (para. 2.15) and possible future competition between road and lake
transport suggest that a closer analysis of intermodal trade-offs is now
required. A recently completed National Transport Study, carried out by
UK-financed experts, provides a useful starting point for such analysis, and
the EPD is gradually improving its capacity in this respect. In additi,n, the
appointment of a local economist to MWS (para. 3.09) will relieve EPD stJf of
some project preparation work and enable them to concentrate more on inter-
modal issues.
2.14      The Government exercises considerable control over the transport
sector through ownership of major carriers; i.e. Air Malawi and Malawi
Railways, including the latter's two subsidiaries: Lake Services Limited,
which handles nearly all transport on Lake Malawi, and Road Motor Services
Limited, a large trucking company. The Government-owned entities are under
the jurisdiction of the MTC, which is also responsible for regulating private
carriers, mainly those in road transport (para. 3.04).
D. Previous Bank Group Involvement
2.15      The Bank Group has been involved in the transport sector of Malawi
since 1966 when Credit S-2-MAI was made to help finance detailed engineering
of the Zomba-Lilongwe road (180 mi). This was followed by the First Highway
Project (Credit 112-MAI, 1968, of US$11.5 million) comprising the recon-
struction and bituminous paving of that road, the refinancing of Credit
S-2-MAI, and a consultants' study of road transport licensing regulations
and road-rail coordination. A Project Performance Audit 1/ concluded that
1/   Report No. 946, December 15, 1975.



-6-
all of the project's objectives were achieved. Construction cost was within
appraisal estimates, although the road was completed about one year behind
schedule. Traffic is about 50% greater than expected at appraisal, and the
rate of return is conservatively estimated at 13%, compared with the appraisal
estimate of 12%. The consultants' study recommended deregulating road trans-
port, raising axle load limits to 9 tons, improving transport statistics, and
relating rail tariffs more closely to economic factors, all of which have been
implemented, although there is scope for further refinement of rail tariffs.
The study expressed misgivings about planned rail investments, but Government
did not share IDA's reservations and proceeded with these investments.
The Audit concluded that "there are grounds to believe that the country will
have an oversupply of transport services" in the Blantyre-Lilongwe-Zambian
border corridor. Apart from this, the major recommendations of the Audit
called for closer supervision 1/ and rectifying the neglect of lower class
roads - although the Audit did not question the composition of the First
Highway Project, noting that the "Zomba-Lilongwe road ... is undoubtedly the
most important highway in Malawi." Both of these points are being addressed
in the Second and Third Highway Projects.
2.16      The Second Highway Project (Credit 523-MAI, 1974, US$10.0 mil-
lion) originally comprised construction of the Lilongwe-Kasungu road (70.3
mi) and a pilot scheme for the improvement and maintenance of district roads
in Kasungu District serving rural development. Both components are proceeding
satisfactorily; the construction is to be completed by the end of this year,
a few months behind schedule. The pilot scheme became operational in Sep-
tember 1976 and has been successful (paras. 3.16-3.17). Substantial cost
savings will be made on the construction component, and it is intended
to use these savings to finance an extension of the pilot scheme to seven
other districts. Details of this extension will be decided in consultation
with IDA following completion of a consultants' study (para. 3.17).
2.17      Finally, transport components have been included in IDA projects
in other sectors (Annex I). Credit S-17-MAI, 1974, provides US$2.0 million
for planning and engineering of infrastructure for the proposed Viphya timber
exploitation scheme. In addition, agricultural projects in the Lower Shire
Valley (Credits 114 and 363-MAI) the Lilongwe (Credits 113, 244 and 550-MAI)
and the Karonga (Credit 282 and Loan 1286-T-MAI) areas have included con-
struction of about 1,680 mi of feeder and crop extraction roads, while the
Karonga Rural Development Project also includes port improvements at Chilumba
and Chipoka on Lake Malawi as well as procurement of a self-propelled barge
for the lake service.
1/   The first contractor selected for the Zomba-Liwonde section was unsatis-
factory and had to be replaced, leading to the delay in project comple-
tion. The Audit notes that the first IDA supervision mission was some
18 months after commencement of works, and that an earlier mission could
have led to speedier resolution of the problem.

3. HIGHWAYS
A. The Network
3.01      The 6,820 mi classified road network (Table 1) comprises 1,880
mi of main roads connecting principal cities and towns and 1,520 mi of
secondary roads linking smaller centers to main roads, both of which are
administered by the Roads Department of MWS. The network also includes 3,143
mi of district roads serving as farm to market or feeder routes, which are
the responsibility of the District Councils, and 290 mi of roads with various
other designations serving particular towns or estates, administered by MWS.
In addition, there are about 1,680 mi of as yet unclassified feeder and crop
extraction roads within several agricultural development projects (i.e. the
Lower Shire Valley, Salima, Lilongwe and Karonga projects) presently adminis-
tered by the project entities but scheduled to be gradually taken over by the
MWS by 1979, as well as several thousand miles of unclassified earth tracks
for which no organization bears responsibility. It is expected that the more
important of these would be absorbed as district roads over a period of
time.
B. Road Use
3.02      The composition and growth of the vehicle fleet is shown in Table 2.
In 1976, the fleet totalled just under 29,600 or six vehicles per 1,000
inhabitants, which is above average for Eastern Africa but only half of
Kenya's vehicle ownership rate. The fleet includes about 10,200 passenger
cars, 300 buses and 10,800 goods vehicles, with the balance made up of 3,600
motorcycles and 4,700 other vehicles (mostly trailers). Reflecting the
general pattern of economic development to date (para. 2.02), 75% of vehicles
are registered in the southern region. Over the period 1967-76, the total
fleet grew at about 6% per year, with goods vehicles growing much faster than
cars, especially over the past five years. More than two-thirds of the
goods vehicles have less than a three-ton carrying capacity, and only 3% have
more than a 10-ton capacity, but the number of trailers in Malawi has almost
doubled in the last two years, and truck-trailer combinations are common on
the main routes.
3.03      Until 1974, there were no systematic traffic counts in Malawi.
However, following an agreement reached during negotiations for the Second
Highway Project, Government has instituted a system of periodic counts
and continuous automatic counts, based on a system designed for Malawi in
1973 by the Transport and Road Research Laboratory in England. The counts
are conducted by the Transport Unit of the National Statistical Office in
Zomba, and a national traffic census has been published annually since 1974.
While these counts are not by themselves a sufficient basis for assessing
long-term traffic growth, in combination with counts made by consultants
over short periods on roads under study and data on fuel imports over the
past decade, they suggest traffic growth of 7-9% annually.



- 8 -
3.04      Road transport is now dominated by small operators and is substan-
tially unregulated. MTC does prescribe freight rates and passenger fares, but
there is considerable undercutting of freight rates, especially since the
decline in transport of Zambian import/export traffic following the opening of
the Tanzania-Zambia railway. Vehicle dimensions and weight regulations are
adequate (maximum allowable axle load being nine tons) but enforcement, which
is the responsibility of the Road Traffic Commissioner's Office within MTC and
the national police, has, until recently, been generally lax with some signs
of road failures that may have been caused by overweight vehicles. Following
these failures, IDA missions emphasized the importance of adequate enforce-
ment, as required under the Credit Agreement for the Second Highway Project.
Government has recently installed three weighbridges at strategic points and
enforcement has improved considerably.
3.05      Road users contribute to Government revenue through taxes and duties
on fuel, lubricants, vehicles and spare parts and through license and regis-
tration fees. The duty on diesel fuel is US$0.10 per gallon and on petrol is
US$0.23 per gallon. Duties on vehicles range from 10% for buses and trucks up
to 40% for high value cars. There is an 18% surtax on fuel and all vehicles
except buses and trucks over 3 tons. Total revenue from road users in 1975/76
is estimated at about US$8 million. Present expenditures on administering and
maintaining the road network, including the costs of the Road Traffic Commis-
sioner's Office, amount to less than US$3 million. Thus, even after allowing
for required increases in maintenance expenditures on District and other lower
class roads (paras. 3.08 and 3.11), road user taxation can be viewed as making
a significant contribution to the capital costs of the network, although
revenue from such taxation is not tied to road construction.
C. Administration
3.06      As noted in para. 3.01, MWS is responsible for all classified roads
except district roads, which are the responsibility of the District Councils.
MWS has divisional offices in each of the three regions, which are directly
responsible for field operations for roads and other works. Road planning and
overall supervision are handled by the headquarters staff, located at Lilongwe.
The Ministry has a Plant and Vehicle Hire Organization with workshops in all
regions and a central workshop in Blantyre for major repairs; equipment avail-
ability is satisfactory. The Ministry's Design Department has responsibility
for the engineering of roads and bridges (para. 3.12) as well as the design of
structures and of water supply systems.
3.07      The Roads Department has 13 engineering posts, 5 of which are filled
by senior expatriates, 5 by Malawians and 3 presently vacant posts which are
expected to be filled by Malawians graduating from the Malawi Polytechnic
during 1977. The Government has an active program for selecting, educating
and training nationals for professional positions, but the program presently
yields too few qualified personnel, mainly because of scarcity of qualified



- 9 -
candidates. Training for such positions is being provided under bilateral
aid, mainly British and Canadian, and UNDP grants; such training opportunities
are more than adequate for the supply of suitably qualified trainees. More-
over, the Malawi Polytechnic is developing its capacity in this area, and the
need to send engineers abroad for training wil. gradually diminish except for
post-graduate training. Good progress has been made in training lower echelon
personnel such as road supervisors, foremen, equipment operators and mechanics.
This training is conducted in the Ministry's fully localized Training Branch
in Zomba. Availability of such personnel is adequate and the capacity of the
Training Branch is satisfactory to keep pace with demand.
3.08      District roads have largely been neglected because of the inade-
quate resources of the District Councils, but under IDA's Second Highway
Project a District Roads Improvement and Maintenance Program (DRIMP) has been
initiated in one District (paras. 2.16 and 3.16), and will be extended to
seven more Districts.
D. Planning and Financing
3.09      Each year the MWS submits proposals for highway improvements to
the Office of the President and Cabinet, whose Development Division is
responsible for preparing a rolling three-year development program after
analysis by the Office's Economic Planning Division, whose capacity in thiL
regard has recently been strengthened (para. 2.13). All major projects
are preceded by feasibility studies, for which MWS relies on consultants.
The recent recruitment of a local economist for MWS will provide useful
project preparation capacity, but reliance on consultants for most feasibil-
ity studies is expected to continue.
3.10      A summary of current and planned road projects is presented in
Table 3. Reflecting government's general strategy of promoting development
in the Central and Northern Regions, about two-thirds of current and planned
road construction is in those regions. The road south from Karonga through
Chiweta to Rumphi is currently under construction, and construction of the
next section south to Mzuzu is due to start next year with financing from
the African Development Bank (AfDB). When these works and the Lilongwe-
Kasungu road (para. 2.16) are completed, the main north-south spine road will
be complete, except for the Kasungu-Jenda and Jenda-Mzuzu sections, which will
be constructed and studied respectively, under the proposed project (paras.
4.03, 4.06). Other major ongoing or planned works in the central and northern
regions are improvement of the lakeshore road between Nkata Bay and Nkotakota,
and the USAID-financed Lilongwe-Mchinji road. While we have some reservations
about the economic merits of a few of the road projects as well as some of the
priorities within the program, its general size and composition are appro-
priate.
3.11      Highway expenditures (Table 4) are financed from the general
budget or, for new construction, from the development account which is



- 10 -
largely made up of grants and credits from bilateral and multilateral aid
programs. Expenditures on construction have averaged about US$9.4 million
equivalent annually over the past four years. MWS maintenance expenditures
have increased from about US$0.6 million in 1971 to about US$2.4 million
in 1977. The funds are sufficient to ensure adequate maintenance of the
bitumen and gravel roads, but increased allocations will be required for
earth roads, particularly as responsibility for some 1,680 mi of such
roads constructed under agricultural projects is being transferred to MWS
over the next three years. Government has agreed to exchange views with
the Association about its maintenance program for lower class roads.
E. Engineering
3.12      The MWS' well-staffed Design Department, consisting of some 62
engineers, technicians and surveyors, and a well-equipped laboratory for
materials and soils testing, is primarily engaged in design of structures
and water supply facilities; the Department carries out preliminary in-
vestigations and road and bridge designs, but engineering for major road
projects is done by consultants. The design standards adopted by the MWS
(Table 5) are appropriate for the country's topographic and traffic condi-
tions.
F. Construction
3.13      For major road projects, the Roads Department employs contractors
following suitable prequalification and tendering procedures; contracts
are generally let on a unit-price basis. In recent years, the Roads Depart-
ment has undertaken several force account road construction projects (about
US$2.8 million equivalent annually), performance under which has been quite
satisfactory. Generally, construction of main roads is not labor-intensive,
although the construction of culverts, drains and structural excavation
absorbs a substantial labor input. However, labor-intensive methods are
being introduced on a trial basis in the improvement and maintenance of
district roads (para. 3.16) and if successful will be used more extensively.
3.14      There is a developing domestic contracting industry, which is fully
employed on buildings, small structures, and estate roads. While domestic
contractors are capable of undertaking improvements under DRIMP, they lack
the capacity for major road works which are undertaken by foreign contractors
who have shown considerable interest in working in Malawi. Senior domestic
contractor personnel are largely drawn from MWS, whose training facilities
(para. 3.07) therefore perform a useful function in indirectly training
contractor personnel. Construction supervision is carried out by the Roads
Department or by consulting engineers acting as its representatives and is
satisfactory. Payment procedures are prompt and the experience of the MWS in
dealing with contractors has been satisfactory.



- 11 -
G. Maintenance
3.15      The Regional Divisions of the MWS are responsible for maintaining
the classified road system with the exception of district roads (para. 3.01).
These maintenance operations are largely mechanized although extensive use is
made of labor for routine maintenance. The Roads Department rents equipment
from the Plant and Vehicle Hire Organization, created in 1971, which is
responsible for procuring and maintaining all Government owned equipment and
vehicles; rental rates are based on the cost of purchasing and maintaining the
equipment; equipment availability and utilization are satisfactory. Each of
the regions has a well trained cadre of maintenance personnel and maintenance
of the all weather network is satisfactory.
3.16      As noted in para. 3.08, district roads have been neglected, but
a District Roads Improvement and Maintenance Program was initiated in 1974
under the IDA-financed Second Highway Project.. Under a pilot scheme in
Kasungu District, an improvement and maintenance unit was established con-
sisting of some light equipment, a depot and housing at a cost of MK 250,000
(US$280,000) (Table 8). The unit assumed responsibility for all maintenance
operations of the Kasungu District Council, and the Council's roads employees
were seconded to the unit for the duration of the pilot scheme.   Most
of the work to date has been by "intermediate technology" using the light
equipment listed in Table 8. However, the unit has recently commenced
experiments with more labor-intensive techniques using hand tools. The pilot
scheme has also trained road foremen from all 24 Districts in office and
workshop administration, concrete pipe casting, installation of culverts,
repairs to timber bridges, setting out road grades and formation of roads,
side ditches and mitre drains. Annual running costs are estimated to be about
MK 60,000 (US$66,000).
3.17      The pilot scheme is being implemented by MWS, but the improvement
and maintenance unit is to be handed over to the District Council when the
pilot phase is completed during 1978; the Council foreman will receive further
training to enable him to assume his new duties. It is already clear that the
scheme has been successful, although some minor modifications in equipment and
depot facilities appear worthwhile. Accordingly, the Improvement and Main-
tenance Program is ready to be implemented on a wider scale, and the consul
tants, Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick and Partners (UK), are preparing a first phase
extension to seven additional districts, the maximum number it is feasible to
establish over the next three years. Costs of establishing and operating
these units 1/ over the next three years are estimated at about MK 3,250,000
(about US$3,600,000), and it is proposed that IDA finance 70% of this out of
savings under the Second Highway Project. This represents the same IDA
participation as applied to the pilot scheme.
1/   Most of the work carried out by these units in the initial years would
be improvement rather than maintenance.

4; THE PROJECT
A. Objective
4.01      The objective of the proposed project is to assist the Govern-
ment in the general strategy of developing the northern half of the country
(paras. 2.02, 3.10), particularly the Mzimba area which is the center of
several recently initiated and proposed rural development projects.
B. Description
4.02      The project consists of:
(a)  construction of the Kasungu-Jenda road (about 53 mi)
to two-lane bituminous surfaced standard and strengthening
three short sections (of about 12 mi total length) of the
Zomba-Lilongwe road; and
(b) consultant services to:
(i) supervise (a); and
(ii) undertake feasibility and possibly engineering
studies of the Jenda-Mzuzu corridor.
(a) Road Construction and Strengthening
4.03      The Kasungu-Jenda road (now about 53.5 mi) is part of the country s
south-north spine road which runs through most of the principal centers, from
the Mozambique border in the south through Blantyre, Zomba, Lilongwe, Mzimba,
Rumphi and Karonga to Chitipa on the Zambian border in the north. The adja-
cent section south from Kasungu to Lilongwe is presently being constructed
under the Second Highway Project and the section south from Lilongwe to Zomba
was constructed under the First Highway Project completed in 1972. The
Kasungu-Jenda section crosses flat to rolling terrain and the alignment of the
existing earth and gravel road is for the most part satisfactory. However,
drainage is poor, resulting in road closures during the rainy season, and the
earth and gravel road surface is rough and costly to maintain under present
traffic. Under the project, the road will be constructed to two-lane
bituminous surfaced standard. The few alignment changes necessary will
shorten the road to about 53.0 mi.
4.04      Detailed engineering (para. 1.02) for this construction was pre-
pared by Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick and Partners (UK) and is satisfactory. The
proposed design standards (Table 6) are consistent with established standards
in Malawi, and are appropriate for the forecast traffic. They are based on a



- 13 -
design speed of 60 mph and a maximum gradient of 5%. The pavement structure
will be natural gravel base course with a double 22 ft wide bituminous sur-
face treatment with a 5 foot shoulder on each side.
4.05      Two short sections (of about 8 mi total length) of the Zomba-
Lilongwe road (180 mi), financed under the First Highway Project, and an
adjoining section of about 4 mi, show signs of serious structural deteriora-
tion, notably subgrade failures in black cotton soil areas. In addition,
traffic has been about 50% higher and heavier than anticipated at appraisal,
so that the former design thickness is inadequate in these areas. Therefore,
the project includes the strengthening of the pavement by overlays of asphaltic
concrete. Design of the strengthening has been carried out by the MWS's
Design Department and is satisfactory.
(b) Consultant Services
4.06      (i) Supervision of the Kasungu-Jenda road construction will be
carried out by the consultants, Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick and Partners (UK),
who undertook the feasibility study and prepared the detailed engineering.
The same consultants also reviewed MWS's final design of the strengthen-
ing works for Zomba-Lilongwe road and will supervise this construction.
(ii) Further, in order to close a gap in preparation work on the
main north-south road between Jenda and Mzuzu (about 110 mi), the project
provides for consulting services to undertake a feasibility study and, if
justified, detailed engineering of this road section.
C. Cost Estimates
4.07      Total project cost including contingencies is estimated at US$15.1
million. Total cost, excluding taxes and duties of about 5-1/2%, is US$14.3
million, with a foreign exchange component of US$9.3 million or 65%. Detailed
costs are as follows:

4.08      Apart from the Kasungu-Jenda construction cost,base costs are
estimated as of September 1977 and have been derived as follows:



- 15 -
(a) Road Construction: The cost estimate for Kasungu-Jenda is based on
the tender price (MK 8.08 million), and averages US$170,000 per mile. In a
detailed analysis, the consultants estimate the foreign exchange component of
construction at 58%. This component includes depreciation of equipment,
imported materials, fuel and spare parts, the foreign expense of expatriate
personnel, overhead costs and profits. The local component comprises mainly
labor, housing, taxes and duties. Costs for strengthening parts of the Zomba-
Lilongwe road were estimated by MWS and reviewed by consultants.
(b) Consultant Services: Cost of consulting services for supervision
is estimated on the basis of 5% of construction costs, which is in line with
recent experience in Malawi. The unit cost would be about US$5,000 per
man-month. Costs for the feasibility and engineering studies are based on
MWS estimates of about 110 man-months at US$5,000 per man-month.
D. Financing
4.09      The project will be financed by IDA (US$10.5 million or 74%), the
OPEC Special Fund (US$1.8 million or 12%) and Government (US$2.0 million or
14% net of taxes and duties.) Execution and delivery of a Loan Agreement
between the Malawi Government and the OPEC Special Fund is a condition of
Credit effectiveness. The external funds would finance all foreign costs
and about 60% of local costs net of taxes and duties.  The detailed financing
plan 1/ is as follows (expressed in US$ million);

E.  Implementation and Procurement
4.10      MWS will be responsible for execution of the project.  The construc-
tion and strengthening works will both be executed under separate unit-price
1/   Including contingencies, excluding taxes and duties.



- 16 -
contracts awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank Group guidelines. Tenders for the Kasungu-Jenda road were sought in
advance of Board presentation to enable construction to commence at the
beginning of the 1978 dry season. The bidding period closed on November
25, 1977, and award of contract is expected to take place in early January
1978. Construction would begin in early April 1978 and is expected to be
completed by the end of 1979. Tenders for strengthening the Zomba-Lilongwe
road will be sought shortly, and it is expected that the contract will be
awarded in April/May 1978 with work completed by the end of 1978.
4.11      Supervision of the construction works, and the carrying out of
the feasibility and engineering studies, will be by consultants who will
be employed under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association.
Government has agreed to discuss the conclusions of the feasibility study
of the Jenda-Mzuzu road with the Association before initiating a detailed
engineering study.
4.12      Government has agreed to an implementation schedule (Chart 2) and
progress reporting requirements, including indices for measuring implementa-
tion progress (Annex II).
F. Disbursements
4.13      IDA Credit funds will be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) 80% of expenditures on construction of the Kasungu-
Jenda road; and
(b) 85% of expenditures on consulting services.
It is recommended to finance retroactively about US$50,000 to meet consultants
fees for preparing tender documents and evaluating bids for the construction of
the Kasungu-Jenda road. An estimated schedule of disbursements is given in
Table 7. Any funds remaining in the Credit account will be used for project-
related purposes.
5. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
5.01      The Kasungu-Jenda road, which accounts for about 77% of project
costs, will reduce vehicle operating and road maintenance costs, and
significantly reduce travel times, especially by eliminating the loss of
time presently incurred when the road becomes impassable on occasions during



- 17 -
the rainy season. These benefits will accrue in the first instance to road
users, but in view of the competitive nature of the road transport industry
(para. 3.04), and the fact that Government prescribed rates, where observed,
take account of road conditions, savings in truck operating costs can be
expected to be passed on in lower freight rates. It is expected that most
traffic in the early years will have its origin or destination in the area
adjoining the road or in the rural project areas around Mzimba (see Map),
so that benefits will accrue to the population of those areas (estimated
at about 80,000) or to people who trade with them. However, when the final
link in the north-south road (the Jenda-Mzuzu section) is completed, possibly
in 1985, the secondary area of influence of the Kasungu-Jenda road will ex-
pand, and the benefits can be expected to be spread more widely throughout
the northern region.
5.02      Strengthening of the deteriorated parts of the Zomba-Lilongwe road
will save Roads Department the cost of premature reconstruction. It will
also result in some cost savings for vehicle operators.
Rate of Return Analysis
5.03      Rates of return have been computed for the Kasungu-Jenda road,
and the strengthening of Zomba-Lilongwe, by comparing costs with the more
readily quantifiable benefits. Other benefits, which have not been quanti-
fied, are travel time savings for other than paid drivers, accident reduction,
improved comfort, and increased ease of administration. In both cases, cost
is taken as the net of tax cost of the roadworks under consideration, in-
cluding supervision and physical contingency costs.
5.04      In 1976, traffic on the Kasungu-Jenda road averaged 86 vehicles
per day (vpd) 1/ and, at an expected growth rate of 9% per year 2/ would
reach 122 vpd in 1980, when the new road is expected to open. It is
assumed that the substantial improvement in travel conditions provided
by the new road would generate additional traffic equivalent to 20% of the
traffic level which could be expected in 1980 in the absence of the road
improvement 3/. Total traffic is assumed to grow at 9% per year until 1989,
1/   This comprised 8 cars, 4 vans, 17 land rovers, 4 buses, 15 small
(two-axle) trucks, and 38 large (three-axle or larger) trucks.
2/   This is at the upper end of the range of traffic growth rates
experienced throughout the country (para. 3.03), but is considered
justified in view of major planned agricultural development around
the Mzimba area and the expected impact of completing the adjoining
Kasungu-Lilongwe road.
3/   If anything, this is conservative.  Traffic in the opening year of
the Zomba-Lilongwe road, improved under the First Highway Project,
was 50% higher than the appraisal forecast, which was based on
extrapolation of past growth of 7% per year plus generated traffic
of about 8% in the first year.



- 18 -
then 8% per year to 1999, the end of the estimated 20-year life of the road.
On the basis of the vehicle operating costs shown in Table 9, and following
the conventional method of valuing generated traffic benefits at half the
unit rate applied to normal traffic, total vehicle operating cost savings
are estimated at MK 800,000 (US$880,000) in 1980, rising to MIK 3,750,000
(US$4,120,000) by 1999 (Table 10). Together with road maintenance savings,
these benefits are estimated to yield a rate of return of 14%. The road has
a first year rate of return of 9%, after charging interest of 10% per year
during the construction period; because it has not been possible to quantify
all benefits (para. 5.03) actual first year benefits will be higher than
estimated. If unanticipated construction cost increases, the major project
risk, would amount to 10% more than the estimated cost or if traffic is 10%
less than expected, the rate of return would still be satisfactory at 13%. As a
further test, a rate of return was computed for a gravel road instead of the
proposed bitumen road; the rate of return for the gravel road is lower, at
11%, even assuming it has the same economic life of 20 years. Finally, a
separate rate of return was calculated for the northern 17 mi where traffic in
1976 was somewhat less than the weighted average for the whole road (55 vpd
compared with 86). The rate of return for a bitumen road for this section is
still satisfactory, at 10%.
5.05      For the strengthening of sections of Zomba-Lilongwe, it is estimated
that unless the proposed works are carried out, complete reconstruction
would be necessary in 1984 and higher vehicle operating costs (Table 9) would be
incurred until that time. Traffic on the affected sections was 413 vpd in
1975 1/ and is estimated to grow at 9% per year, except that the opening of
the Lilongwe-Salima railway in early 1978 is pessimistically assumed to lead
to a reduction of two-thirds in the heavy truck traffic. The cost and benefit
streams are detailed in Table 10. The estimated rate of return is 13%. A
small proportion of the benefits would accrue to Zambia and Mozambique.
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      Government has agreed:
(a) to exchange views with the Association about its
maintenance program for lower class roads (para. 3.11);
(b) that consultants will be employed on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association, and that the results
of the feasibility study of the Jenda-Mzuzu road will be
discussed with the Association prior to proceeding with
detailed engineering (para. 4.11); and
1/   Composition was 130 cars, 64 vans, 36 land rovers, 28 buses, 119 two-
axle lorries, 18 three-axle lorries and 18 four-axle lorries.

1! Represents the difference between vehicle operating costs on existing road and road with asphaltic concrete overlay.  It is
estimated that, without an overlay now, the existing road would require reconstruction in 1984 after which there would be
negligible difference in vehicle operating costs between the project and "base case".
2/ Represents residual value of road reconstruction in 1984.
