                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the final ISR before project closing of June 30, 2013. Progress toward the Project Development Objective (PDO) remains moderately unsatisfactory. All activities under the
                         original loan have been completed, and these activities led to improved efficiency and productive use of Thailand's national highway network in terms of reduced average unit costs
                         and reduced vehicle operating costs. The asset value of the national highway network also increased as expected. However, the highway asset values and efficiency improvement

                         were measured before the historic floods of 2011 that affected many parts of the country, including some national highways improved under the original loan. The activities under
                         the additional financing loan suffered from serious delays due to delayed signing of the loan, the floods of 2011, and in the case of civil works procurement, one round of procurement
                         failure. According to the Department of Highways (DOH), the civil works procurement failure - no bids were submitted from the pre-qualified contractors - was due to the
                         overwhelming number of on-going road reconstruction and rehabilitation projects in the market after the 2011 floods, that caused rapid increases in input costs. Considering that the
                         project would require an extension of at least two years beyond the current closing date of June 30, 2013 for all civil works to be completed and given the uncertainties if a second
                         procurement process would be successful, the Bank informed DOH on January 8, 2013 that the Bank was unable to extend the Additional Financing Loan beyond the current closing
                         date of June 30, 2013.
