                         The project has so far contributes to improved efficiency in national highway maintenance in terms of unit cost. The asset value of national highway network also increased in
                         accordance with the target. (Note: This was measured before the impact of the recent flood that affected many areas of the country, including some of the national highways
                         improved under the project. The exact impact has not been estimated.) These outcomes have been achieved through the project's interventions in highway rehabilitation,

                         unlikely, hence the rating downgrade.

                         The Department of Highways (DOH) should make every effort to speed up the procurement of the civil works under the Additional Finance loan.

                         minor restructuring may be considered.
