                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All activities under the original loan have been completed, except one small TA. But the activities under the additional finance loan are still in procurement process. Since the last
                         update, there has been good progress in the procurement of the civil works for the widening of five national highways under the additional finance loan. The Pre-Qualification
                         Evaluation has been completed and the draft Bid Documents have just been submitted to the Bank. However, due to the previous significant delays, completion of the project by the
                         current closing date is unlikely. Despite the serious delays under the additional finance loan, the project has so far contributed to improved efficiency in national highway

                         2011 flood that affected many areas of the country, including some of the national highways improved under the project.) These outcomes were achieved through the project's
