                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress toward the PDO remains moderately unsatisfactory. All activities except one small technical assistance activity under the original loan have been completed, and those
                         activities led to improved efficiency and productive use of the national highway system in terms of reduced average unit costs. The asset value of the national highway network also
                         increased in line with expectations. However highway values and efficiency were measured before the historic floods of 2011 that affected many parts of the country, including some
                         national highways improved under the original loan. Activities under the additional financing loan are still under procurement after the first round of bidding resulted in no bids

                         submitted from the pre-qualified contractors, probably due to the overwhelming number of road reconstruction and rehabilitation projects already ongoing after the 2011 floods. The
                         Bank and Borrower are under discussions about next steps given the closing date is six months away.
