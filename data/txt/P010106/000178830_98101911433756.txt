PAKISTAN
APPRAISAL OF FAUJI FERTILIZER PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
A.   Background and Summary
1.01      The proposed Fauji Fertilizer Project (the Project) consists of a
new natural gas-based urea plant with a capacity of 1,725 tons per day (tpd),
including an intermediate ammonia plant of 1,000 tpd capacity, and other
facilities. It is to be built at Goth Machhi, Punjab Province. A similar
project was prepared in 1976 and an IBRD loan of US$55 million approved by
the Board in April 1977. Before signing of the loan documents, the foreign
sponsor, Agrico Chemical Co. of the US, decided to withdraw from the Project.
Since then, the local sponsors have found new partners with whom they have
agreed to proceed with the Project. The Government of Pakistan has requested
that a US$55 million IDA Credit be granted to finance part of the foreign
exchange cost of the new project.
1.02      The Project's main parameters and the proposed amount of the Bank
Group's contribution have remained substantially unchanged. The plant is
scheduled to come on stream by mid-1981 and will increase Pakistan's nitrogen
capacity by nearly one-third. It is expected to make the country self-suffi-
cient in nitrogeneous fertilizers until 1984. The Project is expected to cost
up to US$272 million equivalent, including US$169 million in foreign exchange.
It is to be implemented and operated by the Fauji Fertilizer Company Ltd.
(FFC), which was formed in May 1978 by the Fauji Foundation (Fauji), a
Pakistani charitable trust with satisfactory industrial experience, and Haldor
Topsje A/S (Topsoe) of Denmark, a well-known chemical plant design and process
development company. Anic S.p.A. of Italy, a parastatal manufacturer of fer-
tilizers and petroleum products, has been retained to operate the FFC plant
during its initial years. Fauji has subscribed 35.8% and Topsoe 6.4% of the
shares in the newly-formed company. The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) the
Danish Industrialization Fund for Developing Countries (IFU), and a consor-
tium of Pakistani commercial banks and financial institutions will own,
respectively, 12.2%, 6.4% and 39.2% of the shares, the latter also providing
the local debt. The proposed IDA credit would be made to the Government of
Pakistan, for on-lending to FFC. Additional external financing is to come
from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) (US$40
million), Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) (DM 95 million or about US$40
million equivalent), and Italian and Danish government loans of US$10 million
and US$3.9 million equivalent, respectively.
1.03      The Project is based on modern, commercially-proven technology.
Experienced companies pertaining to the Snam Group of Italy have been selected
for the engineering and construction of the plant; they will have financial
incentives to complete the Project on schedule and within a specified budget,
thereby minimizing the risk of construction delays and cost overruns. They
have begun the execution of engineering work and requested suppliers' bids for
some equipment.

1.04      This report is a revised and updated version of the report entitled,
"Pakistan: Appraisal of Fauji-Agrico Fertilizer Project," issued on March
15, 1977 and, thus, does not entirely conform with the new format for Staff
Appraisal Reports instituted as of 1977. A number of the Annexes to the 1977
Appraisal Report have been omitted from this report whenever their contents
were not of relevance in the context of this re-submission.
1.05      The Project was re-appraised in April 1978 by Messrs. H. Harald
Burmeister and C. J. Pratt, during visits to Pakistan and Denmark and fol-
lowing earlier meetings with the sponsors in Washington, D.C. The previous
report was prepared by Messrs. Iskander, Lietard, Pratt, Skapin and Stier of
the Industrial Projects Department.
B.   Bank Group Involvement in the Pakistan Fertilizer Sector
1.06      The proposed Credit would be the Bank Group's third assistance to
the fertilizer industry in Pakistan. The first loan (US$32 million), together
with an IFC equity investment (US$2.9 million), was made in July 1968 to Dawood
Hercules Chemicals (DH) for a 345,000 tpy urea plant. 1/ The Project has
proven a technological and economic success. DH began production in July 1971,
virtually on schedule and close to the original budget, and has consistently
operated above rated capacity. But because of the devaluation of the Pakistan
Rupee in 1971, changes in taxation provisions and differences with the Govern-
ment on pricing and marketing arrangements, discounted returns on local and
foreign investment have decreased to 8% and 4%, respectively.
1.07      The second Loan (US$35 million) was made in May 1974 to the public
sector Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. to expand and modernize its existing facil-
ities at Multan. 2/ This Project, now under construction and designed to
produce 330,000 tpy prilled nitrophosphate and 600,000 tpy calcium ammonium
nitrate, was appraised in the fall of 1973 before the sharp oil price increase
and has borne the full brunt of the subsequent worldwide inflation and equip-
ment delivery delays. It has also suffered from management deficiencies and
from shortages of skilled Pakistani manpower, attracted by higher wages in
the Middle East. Meanwhile, management has been strengthened and the Project
is now expected to be completed by August 1978, 20 months behind appraisal
schedule. The total financing required is estimated at US$198 million, or 86%
above the appraisal estimate of US$106 million. The company has obtained the
additional financing required. Due to higher international fertilizer prices,
the Project remains economically viable.
1.08      The Bank Group has played an important role in helping prepare
the FFC project. IFC had originally introduced Fauji, which was seeking a
foreign partner with experience in the fertilizer industry, to Agrico. This
1/   Appraisal Report No. AA-4a, June 20, 1968.  A Project Performance Audit
Report No. 1235 was issued on November 10, 1976.
2/   Appraisal Report No. 373-PAK, April 3, 1974.

joint venture approach was encouraged by the Government since the Government-
owned National Fertilizer Corporation (NFC) was already overstretched in
constructing two large projects (at Multan and Mirpur Mathelo), and the two
existing private sector fertilizer companies--Esso Pakistan Fertilizer Ltd.
and DH--had no expansion plans. After Agrico's withdrawal, the Bank continued
to assist Fauji in restructuring the Project to fit the new circumstances.
FFC has now contracted with Anic to operate the new plant, with James Chemical
Engineering (JCE) of the US to provide technical advisor services and with
Topsoe, in addition to joining as an equity partner and providing technical
assistance in implementing the Project, to adequately strengthen its marketing
capability. Earlier, the Bank Group had assisted the Government and the
sponsors in formulating a framework for pricing and marketing the fertilizer
produced so as to simultaneously ensure efficient project execution and
operation, reasonable fertilizer prices, and an attractive return on sponsors'
equity.
1.09      The proposed Project is believed to incorporate the lessons learned
from the DH and NFC projects. It embodies the elements that have contributed
to DH's technological and economic success, namely: the involvement of local
and foreign partners who combine the knowledge of local conditions with tech-
nical, operating and marketing experience; the hiring of engineering firms
which have recent experience in constructing an ammonia/urea plant (the
Pak-Saudi Fertilizers Ltd. plant at Mirpur Matelo) which is almost identical
in design to the Project plant and in a location only 20 miles from the FFC
site; emphasis on reliable plant design; and careful planning and training.
The Marketing and Pricing Principles Agreement between the Government and
FFC deals satisfactorily with the pricing, taxation, devaluation and marketing
issues which have adversely affected DH's financial performance. Similarly,
the contracts between FFC and the engineering firms provide a satisfactory
framework for dealing with project implementation problems that have affected
the other projects.
II. THE COMPANY
A.   Organization and Management
2.01      The Project will be owned and carried out in the private sector
by FFC, a limited liability company formed in May 1978 under the Pakistani
Companies Act of 1913, with an authorized capital of US$81.6 million equi-
valent. The relationship between the two principal equity investors, Fauji
and Topsoe, is governed by the Participation and Shareholders Agreements;
they are acceptable to the Association and have been approved by the Govern-
ment. This also applies to the Technical Assistance and Know-How Agreements
between FFC and Topsoe, the Technical and Operating Services Agreement with
Anic and the Technical Advisor Service Agreement with JCE. Under these
Agreements, Topsoe and Anic will provide FFC, for reasonable fees, all their
needed current and future know-how relating to engineering, design, procure-
ment, plant operation and marketing, and will also assist in training FFC's

personnel; Topsoe will, furthermore, assume the primary role in project execu-
tion and will supervise the engineering firms which will be paid lump-sum fees
for plant engineering, design and procurement services, plus reimbursable fees
for construction and erection supervision; the latter provision would allow
the engineering firms to supplement local skilled personnel by foreign per-
sonnel where necessary. In addition to assuming responsibility for operating
management for a period of at least three years after start-up, Anic will
participate in the design, engineering, pre-start-up and commissioning stages
of the plant. JCE will provide independent technical advisor services to
FFC's Managing Director during the construction period.
2.02      FFC's corporate structures during construction and during commercial
operation are descbribed in Annex 2-1. FFC's Board will be composed of 13
directors, of which Fauji will appoint 6, and the other shareholders, one
each. The Participation Agreement stipulates that the Managing Director of
Fauji will also be the Managing Director and Chief Executive of FFC. Also,
Fauji will appoint the Assistant Managing Director, to be responsible for
day-to-day operations, and the Manager, Finance and Administration. Topsoe
will appoint the Project and Marketing Managers; Anic will appoint the Manager
of Operations. This organizational structure, which combines Topsoe's tech-
nical and marketing know-how, Anic's operating expertise, and JCE's advice on
engineering, along with Fauji's working experience under local conditions, is
expected to provide a sound basis for project execution and operation.
2.03      FFC is headed by Maj. Gen. (Retd.) Rao Farman Ali Khan, the Managing
Director of Fauji Foundation, an experienced businessman, administrator and
military officer. Resumes of management appointees, who are all considered
qualified and acceptable by the Association, are summarized in Annex 2-1.
B.   The Fauji Foundation
2.04      The Fauji Foundation is a charitable trust, set up in 1953 and
operated for the benefit of military veterans. Its basic purpose is to pro-
vide medical services and educational stipends for ex-servicemen and their
families. Apart from a medical center and four small hospitals, Fauji operates
nine industrial ventures with total 1977 sales of PRs 763 million--three sugar
mills (generating about 59% of Fauji's sales), three textile mills (39%), a
gas bottling and distribution company and a food processing firm (2%). Some
salient features of Fauji's audited earnings and financial position are
summarized below from Annex 2-2.

2.05      To better finance its charitable activities, which have expanded
from about PRs 3.9 million in 1971 to PRs 15.4 million in 1977, Fauji has
increasingly shifted its investments from fixed income securities to indus-
trial activities, as shown in the nearly tenfold increase in fixed assets in
that period. The effect of the new investment policy is reflected in the
Foundation's rising profitability (except for the recession years 1974 to
1976, when earnings were negatively affected by a slowdown in the textile
industry). As the above table indicates, Fauji's capitalization and liquidity
have remained sound. As discussed in para 5.06, Fauji's projected cash flow
(Annex 2-2) over the next three years when the fertilizer plant is to be
constructed, together with its present liquidity positionb are expected to be
adequate to meet its equity commitment for the Project.
C.   Haldor Topsoe A/S
2.06      Topsoe is incorporated under the laws of Denmark with a share
capital of about US$5 million equivalent, 50% of which is owned by the Topsoe
family through the Topsoe Foundation and 50% by the Italian Snamprogetti S.p.A
(Snam), a large, internationally recognized engineering firm selected to
execute the Project. Topsoe is a research, engineering and consulting company
specializing in heterogenous catalysis and the design of industrial plants
based on catalytic processes. It maintains extensive research laboratories
and develops and manufactures catalysts, especially for the fertilizer and
gas industries, and licenses a number of processes for them. Its engineering
activities comprise basic engineering, particularly for contractors in connec-
tion with license agreements, detailed engineering and consulting services.
As of December 1977, the company's net fixed assets had a value of about US$18
million equivalent, its revenues for the year from the sale of catalysts, and



contract services and licenses totaled US$27 million equivalent, with an
after tax net income of US$2 million equivalent. For a more detailed
description of the company, see Annex 2-3. Topsoe has extensive experience
in engineering as the main contractor of fertilizer plants in Europe and
several developing countries. The company, thus, appears to be qualfified to
adequately provide the Project with the technical know-how needed for its
implementation.
D.   Anic S.p.A.
2.07      Anic, like Snam, is part of the Italian state-owned Ente Nazionale
Idrocarburi (ENI) Group. Together with subsidiary and affiliated companies,
Anic is one of the three largest Italian chemical manufacturer with operations
in fields ranging from base to fine chemicals, and with substantial interests
in the sectors of fertilizers, synthetic rubbers, plastics, chemical fibers and
intermediate chemical products. Its headquarters are located near Milan, with
22 operating plants in Italy and 3 abroad. Fertilizer is manufactured in four
of the Italian locations. Near Manfredonia, in the South-East of Italy, Anic
operates a plant which is largely identical with the one to be constructed by
FFC. Anic employs 22,000 people. Its 1976 total consolidated sales amounted
to US$1.1 billion equivalent; in 1975 and 1976, the company did not make
profits. Further information on Anic and ENI is given in Annex 2-4.
2.08      Anic has the capability and manpower availability to adequately
perform its role as an operating company for the project.
E.   James Chemical Engineering
2.09      JCE is a US consulting firm in the fertilizer field.  It has pro-
vided services to a number of fertilizer projects in the US and many parts
of the world, including some financed by the Bank, USAID and IFC in Indonesia,
Bangladesh, Egypt and India. JCE has agreed to advise FFC for a period of
three years on the design, procurement, erection and commissioning of its
plant. The Technical Advisor Services Agreement calls for 225 man-months of
service to be provided for assignment at the project site, in Rawalpindi and
in Milan.
2.10      JCE has the capability of adequately and independently advising FFC
in a capacity of Owners Representative. In the opinion of the lenders, the
provision of such services to the Company is required in view of the close
structural relationship between Topsoe, FFC's foreign partner, Anic, the
operating company, and Snam, the primary engineering firm and shareholder
of Topsoe.
III. FERTILIZER MARKET AND MARKETING
3.01      A detailed account of the fertilizer sector in Pakistan is given
in Annexes 3-1 through 3-3. As shown in the table below, both production and
imports of fertilizers have been increasing rapidly since 1961.  In 1977,



- 7 -
domestic production accounted for 60% and 10% of nitrogenous and phosphatic
fertilizer consumption, respectively. All potash requirements, mostly
used on tobacco, are met through imports.

A.   Fertilizer Consumption
1.   Past Trends
3.02      As shown on the table below, during 1966-1971, nitrogenous and
phosphatic fertilizer consumption increased from low bases at average annual
rates of 29% and 90%, respectively. This was primarily due to the introduc-
tion of high-yielding varieties of rice and wheat during the mid-1960s,
increased availability of water, and attractive fertilizer prices. The 1973
floods, the d5ought and the mishaps at the Tarbela Dam, mainly in 1974 and
1975, and the doubling of fertilizer prices (reflecting high import prices)
without a commensurate increase in crop prices, led to decline and stagnation,
respectively, in nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizer consumption during
1973-75. The disruption of the fertilizer distribution system, following
the takeover of fertilizer marketing in 1973 by the Provincial Governments,
further contributed to this decline.

1976 - 1977           15        8      22
3.03      In response to this negative development, the Government took a
number of steps in 1975 and 1976 to stimulate fertilizer demand. It improved
the attractiveness of using fertilizer by increasing crop prices and reducing



- 8 -
fertilizer retail prices, allowed the fertilizer companies to revive their
own marketing and distribution systems, and increased their marketing margins.
In addition, measures were taken to increase availability of agricultural
credit to small and medium farms and to simplify lending procedures. All
this, combined with good weather, resulted respectively in a 23% and 79%
increase of N and P 05 consumption in 1976 and a further 15% and 8%,
respectively, in 1977. The increase in phosphatic fertilizer consumption was
largely due to the Government's policy of maintaining a favorable price for
phosphatic fertilizer to correct a serious imbalance in the nitrogen/phosphate
(N:P) ratio. As a result, N:P ratio decreased from 14:1 in 1968 to 8:1 in
1970 and 4:1 in 1977. It is still, however, double the recommended ratio of
2:1.
3.04      Fertilizer is used mainly in irrigated areas on wheat (58% of
total consumption), cotton (15%), sugarcane (14%), rice (9%) and maize (4%).
Urea remains the most popular nitrogenous fertilizer and accounts for about
85% of the N consumed. Despite the rapid increase, fertilizer consumption
remains fairly low by international standards; in 1973 application rates
averaged about 21 kg of nutrient per ha compared, for example, to 161 kg per
ha for Egypt and 317 kg per ha for Korea. Depending on the type of crop,
application rates in Pakistan are only 1/4 to 1/3 the recommended levels.
2.   Prospects
3.05      Demand projections up to 1985, based on likely cropping patterns,
availability of water and existing benefit/cost ratios for using fertilizers,
are given in Annex 3-1. Between 1977 and 1985, consumption of nitrogenous
fertilizer is expected to increase from 511,000 to 954,000 nutrient tons,
implying an average 8.1% annual growth rate. Annual consumption growth is
projected to progressively decline from 15% achieved in 1977 to about 7% in
1981, and about 6% in 1985, as opportunities for further increasing water
supply and using high-yielding seed varieties diminish. A larger growth rate
is feasible but will require structural improvements in the efficiency of
the irrigation system (such as control of salinity, water logging, and soil
erosion) and the development of a policy and an institutional framework to
better reach the small and medium farms.
3.06      Demand for phosphatic fertilizer is expected to almost triple from
118,000 nutrient tons in 1977 to 329,000 nutrient tons in 1985. These pro-
jections are predicated on the assumption that the Government will maintain
its pricing policies to improve the N:P balance from 4:1 in 1977 to 3:1 in
1985.
B.   Fertilizer Supply
1.   Existing Plants
3.07      There are five fertilizer plants in operation in
Pakistan, with a total combined capacity of 317,000 tpy of nitrogenous and
17,500 tpy of phosphatic nutrients. Two are medium-sized plants in the
private sector: Esso Pakistan Fertilizer Company Ltd. (76,000 tpy of N) and



-9-
Dawood Hercules (163,000 tpy of N) which have consistently operated at over
100% of capacity; they account for 75% of the industry's installed capacity
for N and over 85% of output. The remaining plants (with a combined capacity
of 78,000 tpy of N) are operated by NFC; because of design deficiencies in the
ammonia units, the capacity utilization of one plant has averaged about 40%.
In 1977, local production met about 60% of the nitrogen but only 10% of the
P 20  consumption.
2.   Future Supply
3.08      Ongoing investments in three large fertilizer projects, including
FFC, at a cost of about US$700 million, will increase Pakistan's nitrogen
and phosphatic fertilizer production capacity by 320% and 900% respectively
by 1982. Two of these projects--Pakarab at Multan (scheduled to start commer-
cial operation by late-1978) and Pak-Saudi at Mirpur Mathelo (late-1979)--will
be operated by NFC. The third, FFC, will be in the private sector.
C.   Projected Nitrogen Supply/Demand Balance

- 10 -
3.10      With the implementation of the proposed FFC Project, Pakistan is
expected to be self-sufficient in nitrogenous fertilizer until 1984, with a
negligible surplus resulting during the first three years of FFC's operation
(1982-84). This production may have to be supplemented by imports in the
event of slippage in the completion of new plants, lower than assumed capacity
utilization, higher than projected demand, or an increase in stocks with
producers and dealets from the present minimal levels to perhaps as much as
two months' consumption (up to 150,000 tons of N equivalent). Alternatively,
an expansion of the existing DH plant could be envisaged to prevent new
shortages from occurring in the mid-1980s. Such a possibility is being
discussed in Pakistan but preparation of a specific project has not yet begun.
In the event DH should be ready to come on stream with a doubling of their
current production (167,000 tons of N) two years after FFC, under current
assumptions for market growth, the development of shortages could be delayed
until about 1990.
D.   Fertilizer Pricing, Distribution and Credit
1.   Fertilizer Pricing
3.11      The Government sets both retail and ex-factory prices for ferti-
lizers. Retail prices, uniform throughout the country, are reviewed perio-
dically in the context of import prices, domestic production and marketing
costs, and the relation between crop and fertilizer prices. The ex-factory
price is established on a case-by-case basis, in principle with the aim of
allowing each manufacturer a fair return on invested capital. The Government
also allows fertilizer producers and importers a marketing margin to cover
transportation and marketing costs. During recent years, retail prices (PRs
1,360-1,500 per ton of urea) were higher than the prices paid to domestic
producers (PRs 784-856). The difference less the distribution costs, including
dealer margins, was kept by the Government as a "development surcharge" with
which it subsidized imports.
3.12      Because of higher import prices, between 1973 and 1975 the Govern-
ment increased urea prices in stages from PRs 570 to 1,500 per ton without a
commensurate increase in crop prices. By 1975, only sugarcane and cotton,
which had a benefit/cost ratio over 2.5 (the minimum ratio considered neces-
sary to induce farmers to use fertilizers), remained attractive candidates for
application of additional fertilizer. To stimulate fertilizer demand, the
Government reduced the urea retail price in 1976 to PRs 1,360 per ton and
increased prices of major crops. The resulting benefit/cost ratios for cash
crops (5.0-5.6) are favorable; those for food crops (2.5-3.5), however,
need further review to provide a sufficient incentive to increase production
of food crops by more use of fertilizer.
2.   Distribution
3.13      In October 1975, the Government once again allowed private sector
manufacturers and distributors, which accounted for about 80% of fertilizer
sales prior to the 1973 nationalization of fertilizer distribution, to market
both nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers without any territorial restric-
tions. NFC has set up its own marketing organization, thus shifting the
responsibility for fertilizer marketing from the public trading agencies to



the fertilizer producers. Despite an increase, in 1977, of dealer commis-
sions from PRs 28 to PRs 40 per ton of fertilizer, the marketing margins still
remain small for adequate promotional and educational programs and need to be
restructured to induce producers, wholesalers and dealers to undertake a more
vigorous promotional and educational program for small and medium farms. The
Government has agreed to keep this matter under review, and particularly with
regard to dealers' commission, will by October 31, 1978, make proposals to the
Association for a further increase, to be implemented not later than December
31, 1978.
3.   Credit
3.14      Largely as a result of simplification in agricultural lending pro-
cedures and the participation of commercial banks in such lending, starting
from 1972, agriculture credit increased from PRs 330 million in 1973 to an
estimated PRs 1,600 million in 1977, of which about 20% was for fertilizers.
The number of commercial bank branches increased from 3,200 in 1972 to more
than 6,400 in 1977, when their disbursements for agricultural loans were about
PRs 790 million, of which 60% was for fertilizers.
3.15      Lack of credit appears, however, to still be a constraint on larger
fertilizer use. A joint study by NFC and USAID (October 1976) indicates thdt
only 45% of the farmers buy their fertilizer on credit: 4% from institutional
sources and 41% from landlords, family, friends and dealers. The study also
indicates that 20% of farms in irrigated areas and 55% on rain-fed land do
not use fertilizers, and 25% of non-users have cited lack of finance as their
main reason for such non-use.
E.   Fertilizer Planning Committee
3.16      The Government has established a Fertilizer Planning Committee.  Its
work program which is satisfactory to the Association includes; (i) review and
coordination of policies and programs in the fertilizer sector, notably on
pricing, marketing margins and credit; (ii) establishment of a sound statis-
tical base for better planning the fertilizer sector; and (iii) exploration
of alternative organizational frameworks to coordinate fertilizer policies and
programs.
F.   FFC's Market and Marketing
3.17      The Project will produce urea, which accounts for about 85% of
nitrogenous fertilizer consumed in Pakistan. According to its Marketing and
Pricing Principles Agreement with the Government, FFC will be responsible for
marketing all its output as well as some phosphatic fertilizers; FFC can do so
without any territorial restrictions. Based on a transportation and marketing
study carried out in February 1976, FFC plans to market 80% of its sales
(512,300 tpy of urea and 125,000 tpy of imported MAP) in the Punjab, which
accounts for 65% of the total fertilizer consumed in Pakistan and where FFC's
market share would be about 30%. The remaining 20% would be marketed in the
Sind which accounts for 25% of fertilizer consumed in Pakistan; FFC's share
in the Sind would be about 20% (Annex 3-4).



- 12 -
3.18      To provide the Project with an adequate marketing capability, Topsoe
has strengthened its staff by hiring, for assignment to FFC, Mr. J. A. Ward,
a citizen of the U.K., who has a background inter alia, as long-time marketing
manager of Esso Pakistan Fertilizer Co. FFC's marketing plans include training
programs for employees, agents and dealers, farm demonstration programs and
advertisement. Furthermore, FFC has agreed to undertake, prior to plant
start-up, a 2-year fertilizer seeding program during which about 320,000 tons
of urea and 60,000 tons of MAP would be sold. The Government has agreed to
allow the Company to obtain local or imported fertilizer in sufficient quan-
tities to undertake such a program effectively. FFC will formulate and the
Government approve a fertilizer seeding program satisfactory to the Associa-
tion by no later than September 30, 1978.
3.19      On the basis of the transportation and marketing study mentioned
above, FFC plans to move 50-60% of its output by truck up to distances of
250-300 miles. No difficulty is expected in obtaining the 100-120 trucks
per day required.   The balance would be transported by rail to six or seven
strategically located fertilizer depots, using unit trains of 70-80 wagons
each to shuttle between the plant and the depots, whose exact locations will
be determined during the seeding period. This approach is intended to ease
the railway congestion that could arise in the early 1980s because of the
implementation of three new fertilizer plants--Pak-Arab, Pak-Saudi and FFC--
with a combined production of 1.3 million tons per year. The study also
concluded that existing railway and wagon capacities would be sufficient to
service these plants, provided unit trains are used in an efficient manner.
G.   Fertilizer Transportation Task Force
3.20      To ensure that transportation receives the attention required, the
Government has set up a Fertilizer Transportation Task Force of the railways
and fertilizer companies to formulate detailed action programs and supervise
their implementation. The work program for the Task Force has been reviewed
by the Association and is acceptable to it.
3.21      In view of the difficulties experienced at the present time in
moving the current fertilizer production, it is considered essential for this
task force to develop, as soon as possible, and, if feasible, in advance of
the start-up of NFC's expanded facilities at Multan in late 1978, an adequate
transportation master plan, to avoid major problems in the movement of ferti-
lizer in the future. The Government has also agreed to cause the Pakistan
Railways to provide sufficient locomotives and railway wagons for FFC's
requirements.

IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Scope
4.01      The Project, which is to be owned and operated by FFC, consists
of (i) a 1,725 tons per day (tpd) prilled urea plant, (ii) an intermediate
ammonia plant of 1,000 tpd, (iii) a 33-mile pipeline to transport natural gas
from the nearby Mari gas field to the project site, and (iv) all necessary
ancillary facilities, namely, a urea bagging plant, storage and loading
facilities, water pipeline and water purification system, effluent treatment
units, a power plant, maintenance and off-site facilities, and a housing
colony. The ammonia and urea plants will both be single stream, economic-sized
units of modern proven design. On the basis of 330 stream days per year, the
plant will have a capacity of 570,000 tpy of urea (262,000 tpy of N).
B.   Gas Supply and Price
4.02      Exploitation operations of the Mari gas field, located in the
Northern part of Sind Province, are jointly owned by Esso Eastern Inc. (51%)
and the Government of Pakistan (49%), with Esso Eastern being in charge of
development and operation. Mari gas has a relatively high carbon dioxide
content which reduces its value for heating purposes but makes it ideal for
producing urea. Accordingly, the Government has reserved output of the Mari
field for fertilizer production. The field's total estimated reserves are 4.0
trillion cubic feet (TCF), of which 1.8 TCF are proven. At present, the Esso
Pakistan Fertilizer Co. Ltd. plant at Dharki is the sole user of Mari gas and
the Pak-Saudi project will become the second by late-1979. Esso Eastern has
allocated, with the Government's approval, 0.3 TCF of gas to Esso Fertilizer,
0.75 TCF for Pak-Saudi and another 0.75 TCF for the proposed FFC project.
With these allocations, which add up to the field's presently proven reserves,
Mari could supply the three plants for about 25 years. Furthermore, it is
estimated that assured plus reasonably assured reserves could supply plants
such as these for about 57 years.
4.03      If, however, an additional plant of FFC's size were established and
used Mari gas, the assured reserves would meet the gas requirements of the
four plants for only about 15 years. Accordingly, the Government has agreed
to guarantee the timely availability of the required gas to FFC and not
sanction any new users until sufficient additional reserves are proven to
satisfy those users without jeopardizing the availability of gas to the three
sanctioned projects.
4.04      The gas contract between Esso Eastern and FFC to supply the Project
with gas for 20 years has been approved by the Government. The base price to
FFC at the gathering point in 1980 will be PRs 2.75 per MSCF (at 700 BTU per
SCF) including PRs 1.60 per MSCF in taxes, and is subject to a cost escalation
formula.



- 14 -
C.   Utilities and Other Raw Materials
4.05      All power required for the Project and the housing colony will be
generated on site, using Mari gas. Water will be drawn most of the year from
a nearby canal and will be supplemented from tubewells during the annual canal
maintenance period of about three weeks.
4.06      All the plant's output will be shipped in locally-made cotton bags
lined with polyethylene. The Government has agreed to provide the foreign
exchange required to pay for these and all other imports required for the
efficient operation and maintenance of the Project.
D.   Plant Location
4.07      The plant will be located on a 575-acre site at Goth Machhi in the
Punjab province, near the Sind border. The site has suitable soil character-
istics, is close to a railroad line, highway and water supply, and has ample
space for expansion. It is about 375 miles from both Karachi and Lahore,
along the main railway line and highway connecting the two cities. The
transportation and marketing study (para 3.17) concluded that in view of
the relatively small amounts of gas required and unsuitability of the gas
for other purposes, it would be more economical to build the plant near the
gas field and transport the product to its markets, mainly in the Punjab, than
to locate the plant closer to its markets and to pipe the gas to it.
E.   Ecology and Safety Precautions
4.08      The plant will be designed and operated in a way to permit FFC to
meet ecological, environmental and safety standards satisfactory to the
Association. These standards will be achieved by good plant design rather
than extensive waste treatment. Liquid and gas effluent will be treated to
yield maximum recovery of nitrogen compounds and waste liquid will be neut-
ralized in a holding pond prior to release.
F.   Operational Manpower and Training
4.09      When in full operation, the Project will employ about 660 people
including some 200 contract workers for product handling, loading, and
general labor (Annex 4-1). Given the rapid expansion of the fertilizer
industry in Pakistan, it is expected that initially only a relatively small
number of the some 100 key experienced personnel could be recruited in
Pakistan. FFC has therefore entered into a Technical Services Agreement with
Anic for operating the plant during the initial three years after start-up, as
well as for selection and training, partly at Anic's plants, of Pakistani
operating, supervisory, and engineering personnel who will be expected to
eventually operate and maintain the plant. FFC has agreed to submit a de-
tailed training program to the Association no later than December 31, 1978,
and to implement it promptly.

G.   Project Execution
4.10      Topsoe will have prime responsibility for project execution, as
shown in the project execution organization chart given in Annex 4-2. Mr. I. C
Carstensen, an experienced Topsoe project engineer, has been appointed Project
Manager. He will report to FFC's Managing Director and will liaise with
Topsoe's Project Director in Denmark. In preparation of its operating role,
Anic will provide know-how and advice during engineering, construction and
commissioning of the plant. JCE will assist FFC by independently advising
on design, engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning.
4.11      As noted above, FFC has selected Snamprogetti S.p.A. (Snam) of
Italy, as the engineering firm for the Project; Coming S.p.A., an Italian
construction firm wholly-owned by Snam, will be responsible for project
construction. Snam will employ the commercially proven Topsoe ammonia
process with which it is experienced, and will design and procure the urea
and ammonia plants and offsites, acting as the prime engineering firm respon-
sible for coordinating the erection and commissioning of the entire plant;
Snam will fully guarantee the work to be performed by Coming S.p.A. The
direct selection of Snam by the sponsors was accepted by the Lenders because
Snam's contract price and services in 1978 compared very favorably with the propo-
sals evaluated in 1976 for the Fauji-Agrico Project. This earlier competition
and evaluation process provided a good basis for establishing the reasonable-
ness and competitiveness of the Snam proposal. JCE, in its role as Owner's
Representative, has carefully reviewed the activities of Snam to date and will
continue to do so to assure appropriate supervision of Snam.
4.12      The contracts signed by FFC with Snam and Coming in May 1978 and
which are acceptable to the Association, USAID and KfW, are based on a
lump-sum fee for plant engineering, design and procurement services, and
reimbursable fees for supervision of construction and erection. The latter
provision allows the engineering firms to supplement local skilled labor by
foreign personnel in case of shortage. The contracts include penalty provi-
sions as an incentive to complete the Project on schedule and within a speci-
fied budget. Snam has assumed full liability for foreign exchange cost
overruns beyond US$12 million above the US$105 million for the landed cost of
equipment, materials and spares included in the Base Capital Cost Estimate
(Annex 5-1).
4.13      Under its Technical Assistance and Know-How Agreements, Topsoe will
make available to FFC its current and future proprietary and technical in-
formation relating to project engineering, design, equipment procurement,
plant operation and marketing. Topsoe will be paid (i) a fixed fee (free
of Pakistani tax) of US$1.0 million, to be reduced by any reimbursements by
FFC for actual pre-project expenses, payable during the first two years of
commercial operation, plus (ii) a royalty, payable annually, of US$1 for every
ton of urea produced and sold during a period of ten years, provided that
production in the first year of operations reaches at least 65% of capacity,
85% in the second and 90% thereafter. Out of the royalty, if earned, Anic
will receive US$0.50 per ton as an incentive for the duration of its operating



- 16 -
contract. In addition, Anic and JCE will be reimbursed for up to US$4 million
of pre- and post-start-up assistance, marketing, training and head office
expenses. Fauji will be reimbursed for expenses, estimated at US$1.5 million
equivalent, incurred prior to the formation of FFC, all as included in the
details shown in Annex 4-3. The average total cost (including overhead,
travel, and living expenses) for managerial and technical personnel provided
by Topsoe, Anic and JCE is estimated at US$7,500 per man month. This assis-
tance package and its costs have been approved by the Government and are
satisfactory to the Association and the other lenders.
4.14      The project execution schedule is shown on Annex 4-4.  A Process
Description is attached as Annex 4-5.
H. Present Status of the Project
4.15      Project preparation is well advanced.  Relevant agreements have been
signed between Fauji and Topsoe and between FFC and outside parties and have
been approved by the Government. Engineering and procurement has been ini-
tiated (see para 5.13) and local Civil Works contracts were awarded in
June 1978.
V. CAPITAL COST AND FINANCING PLAN
A. Project Cost
5.01      The financing required for the Project is estimated at US$260.3 mil-
lion, including US$158.8 million in foreign exchange. Details of the project
cost estimate are given in Annexes 5-1, 5-2 and 5-3 and summarized below:

5.02      The above cost estimate is based on detailed capital cost estimates
prepared by Snam in January 1978, and on costs of comparable urea fertilizer
projects recently financed by the Bank Group. The Project is exempt from
import duties. Physical contingencies are calculated on the basis of 5% for
equipment and 10% for civil works, handling and freight. Price escalation
for equipment is based on projected annual equipment price increases of 7.5%



- 18 -
during 1978-79 and 7% thereafter. On civil works, escalation rates of 15% per
year during 1978-79 and 12% thereafter have been assumed. These rates, which
are high in comparison with the overall forecast rate of inflation in Pakistan,
are based on evidence derived from similar, recently built remote-location
fertilizer plants of substantial increases in heavy construction work. This
situation is expected to continue given the strains affecting the over-
stretched heavy construction industry, mainly as a result of high local demand
and emigration.
5.03      The project cost estimate includes working capital requirements for
the first operating year, estimated at US$12.7 million equivalent, excluding
the cost of spare parts and the initial supply of catalysts which are included
as equipment and material costs.
B. Financing Plan
5.04      Two financing plans have been developed:  a base plan for US$260.3
million--the best estimate of project financing required--and a contingent
plan for US$272.0 million. The difference coincides with the amount by which,
according to the agreement with Snam, the cost of equipment and material can
increase beyond the US$105 million now included in the basic cost estimate,
before Snam would become fully liable. Given Snam's experience in project
execution, the advanced stage of project preparation, and the fact that an
almost identical plant is being constructed by Snam at nearby Mirpur Mathelo
(Pak-Saudi Project), the higher figure is considered a reasonable upper limit
of financing requirements. An adequate part of the US$11.7 million difference
between the basic and contingent financing plans is provided in local currency
(US$6.9 million) to cover overruns, if any, which might occur in civil works.

5.05      The above financing plans are based on a debt/equity ratio of 70/30.
This may seem high for a new company building a grass-roots plant with all its
associated infrastructure and having to repay its debt on a equal principal
basis. In this case, however, the agreement between FFC and the Government
(para 6.01), allows the Company a high enough selling price, particularly
during the initial years of operation, to enable it to service its debt
without difficulty. Debt service coverage is projected to remain above 1.6
and the current ratio above 2.3 throughout the Project's life. Nevertheless,
as a precautionary measure, USAID has agreed to subordinate the on-lending of
its funds to that of other credits until the debt/equity ratio reaches 50/50;
this is expected to be achieved during the sixth year of operation.



- 20 -
5.06      FFC's share capital, to have been fully subscribed as a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Credit, will be paid in pari passu with loans to
maintain a debt/equity ratio of 70/30. Under both financial plans, Fauji will
provide 35.8% of the share capital up to US$29.2 million equivalent in local
currency (PRs 289.1 million). As shown in para 2.06, Fauji's current assets,
as of September 30, 1977, include time deposits of PRs 170 million which have
been reserved to finance the FFC Project. This amount, plus part of the pro-
jected PRs 270 million of expected revenue surplus during the period from 1978
to 1980, would be sufficient to meet Fauji's equity commitment. Additionally,
Fauji has agreed not to undertake without IDA's approval any new industrial
investments or expansions in its existing industrial units, if thereby ex-
penditures in excess of an aggregate PRs 100 million would be incurred, within
the period ending one year after the Project Completion Date. 1/ Fauji will
submit its audited annual financial statements to IDA in a timely manner.
5.07      Topsoe's contribution to FFC's capital (up to US$5.2 million) will
be provided from Topsoe's own resources or borrowed funds. The contribution
by IFU in the same amount will be provided under an Investment Agreement with
Fauji and Topsoe. Topsoe and IFU expect to maintain their equity participa-
tions until about 1988. Furthermore, Fauji and Topsoe have agreed not to sell
or transfer any of their shares in FFC without prior approval of the Associa-
tion and to take all necessary measures to ensure that FFC satisfactorily
performs its obligations under the agreements with IDA and other parties. The
Islamic Development Bank (IDB) is considering an equity contribution of US$10
million, the finalization of which will be a condition of the proposed IDA
Credit's effectiveness.
5.08      A consortium of three Pakistani public sector financial institutions--
the Investment Corporation of Pakistan (ICP), the National Investment Trust
(NIT), and the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC)--are commit-
ted to provide a total of PRs 170 million (about US$17 million equivalent) for
common stock. Both ICP and NIT will make their equity contribution from their
own resources without difficulty. PIDC will raise its equity contribution
from a Government development loan, for which it has already obtained the
Government's commitment. A consortium of five local commercial banks and
two of the above financial institutions 2/, will contribute up to another
PRs 150 million (about US$15.0 million equivalent) in equity in the form of
non-participating preferred shares carrying a 16% cumulative dividend.
1/   For purpose of this covenant, the Project Completion Date will be the
date on which the facilities included in the Project have been tested and
proven to be satisfactory in accordance with sound engineering procedures
and practices and have maintained daily production averaging 80% of full
capacity for a period of at least 60 consecutive days.
2/   This consortium is led by ICP which will contribute PRs 29 million; it
includes NIT (PRs 29 million); and the five nationalized commercial banks
which have committed themselves to a total of PRs 92 million--Habib Bank,
National Bank of Pakistan, and United Bank (PRs 23 million each), Muslim
Commercial Bank (PRs 14.5 million) and the Allied Bank (PRs 8.5 million).



- 21 -
5.09      The Project's foreign exchange requirements not covered by the
foreign equity will be met from foreign loans and credits. The proposed IDA
credit of US$55 million would be made to the Government on standard terms for
on-lending to FFC at a rate of interest of 10%, for 15 years including four
years of grace. This rate is comparable with the rates currently being
charged for foreign currency loans granted by local financial institutions.
The inflation rate in Pakistan from 1975-1978 has been in the area of 8% p.a.
and is projected to continue at 7-8% for the following three years. The USAID
loan (US$40 million) which was committed in early 1977, will be made to the
Government for 40 years including 10 years of grace, at an annual interest of
2% during the grace period and 3% thereafter. The KfW loan (up to DM 95
million) will also be extended to the Government at an interest rate of 2.1%
for 30 years, including nine years of grace. The remainder of the foreign
exchange needs will be covered by official loans of US$10.0 million equivalent
and US$3.9 million, respectively, from the Governments of Italy and Denmark to
Pakistan, tied to purchases of goods and services in the respective countries,
and which have been requested. These funds, as well as the AID and KfW loans
will be on-lent to FFC on the same terms as the IDA Credit. On all, the
Company will carry the foreign exchange risk. As mentioned earlier, the
USAID loan will be temporarily subordinated.
5.10      All local loans (up to US$41.5 million equivalent) are to come from
the same consortium of seven Pakistani financial institutions and commercial
banks which will provide preferred equity. These loans are for 15 years,
including 5 years of grace and carry an interest rate of 4% above the inter-
bank rate prevailing at the time of disbursement (currently 10% per year).
5.11      The Government has agreed to cover any project cost overrun above
US$272 million and promptly provide or cause to be provided any local and
foreign exchange on terms satisfactory to the Association, that may be re-
quired to complete the Project.
5.12      The proposed IDA Credit would become effective upon execution of
the agreements with AID, KfW, IFU and IDB. Furthermore, disbursements in
excess of US$2 million would be made only after the agreements between FFC
and AID, KfW, IFU, IDB and the Governments of Denmark and Italy have become
effective (para 5.12).
C. Procurement
5.13      With the possible exception of small amounts awarded under interna-
tional competitive bidding procedures to local bidders, all foreign loans and
credits will finance imported services and equipment. As shown in Annex 5-4,
Topsoe's, IFU's and IDB's equity, together with Italian Government funds, are
expected to finance most of the costs of engineering, licensing, erection
and construction services, technical assistance and training. USAID's loan,
which is tied to procurement mostly in the US, will finance JCE's fees (about
US$2 million) and equipment, mostly on the basis of a pre-determined list of
items likely to be available on favorable terms in the US. This list includes
construction equipment, water treatment equipment, cooling towers, process
compressors, turbo-generators, bagging equipment and others. The balance of



- 22 -
foreign services and equipment will be financed on a parallel basis by IDA and
KfW, whose loan is untied, so as to disburse the two loans approximately on a
pari passu basis.
5.14      The proposed IDA credit is expected to finance about US$5.0 million
of Snam's engineering services, including up to US$1 million on a retroactive
basis, and about US$50.0 million of equipment and materials. Except for a
maximum US$9 million for foreign procured equipment as detailed below, inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB), in accordance with Association guidelines,
will be used for IDA-financed equipment and materials. Advertisements calling
for vendor registration, approved by the Association, have been published in
May 1978. Proprietary and time critical equipment to be financed by the
proposed IDA credit is estimated to cost no more than US$6 million, and will
be procured following the receipt of bids from lists of qualified foreign
suppliers which have been approved by the Association. Items costing less
than US$100,000 equivalent each and totalling no more than US$3 million will
be purchased from suppliers on the basis of suitability, availability and
price. A preference of 15% or the customs duty, whichever is lower, will be
allowed to qualified Pakistani manufacturers for the purpose of evaluating
bids following ICB. Bid invitation and evaluation will be FFC's responsi-
bility with JCE's and Snam's assistance as required.
D.   Allocation and Disbursement of IDA Credit
5.15      Disbursements from IDA will be made on a parallel basis with the
cofinanciers as far as practical. Disbursements from the proceeds of the
Credit will be made against:
-    100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported
equipment, and engineering services; and
-    100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) for
locally manufactured equipment awarded under
international competitive bidding.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Pricing
6.01     As noted in para 3.11, the Government sets the ex-factory price for
individual fertilizer manufacturers on the principle of allowing them a reason-
able return on investment. The Marketing and Pricing Principles Agreement
which has been signed between the Government and FFC and is acceptable to IDA
and other lenders, stipulates that the ex-factory price of urea for the FFC
project will be set for a period of 10 years following the commencement of
commercial operations, so as to yield an annual 16% after-tax return on the
par value of preferred shares and an annual 20% after-tax return on common



- 23 -
share capital, based on 65% capacity utilization 1/ in the first twelve months
of operation, 85% in the second, and 90% from the third year onwards. FFC
will bear the production and sales volume risk and will only realize the above
returns if it produces and sells the urea produced at the levels stipulated
above. FFC's return will, therefore, be lower/higher should its sales be
lower/higher than the annual production levels stipulated.
6.02       The Marketing and Pricing Principles Agreement applies to both
domestic sales and exports of fertilizer, the latter to be allowed if the
Government declares an exportable surplus, and if they conform with Pakistan's
export policies. In case of currency realignments, the price of urea will be
adjusted so as to allow FFC to service its foreign and local debt and each
sponsor to earn 20% on share capital (denominated in US$ for foreign, and in
PRs for local investors), if the plant operates at or above the stipulated
capacity levels. In case the agreement is not extended after its initial
ten years, prices of fertilizer will be set to allow FFC a reasonable return
on equity.
6.03       Two major provisions have been added to the Marketing and Pricing
Principles Agreement to induce the sponsors to minimize capital cost, which is
one of the most important determinants of production cost in capital intensive
fertilizer projects. First, capital cost in excess of US$272 million, which
is considered an upper limit for the Project if efficiently executed, will not
be included in the pricing formula. 2/  This provision puts a ceiling on urea
prices and reduces FFC's return on equity if project cost exceeds US$272 mil-
lion. Second, funds borrowed from or through the Government to finance cost
overruns in excess of US$272 million will have to be repaid by FFC prior to
any dividend payment. This provision would penalize FFC in two ways: (i) it
would reduce its return on net worth (share capital plus retained earnings)
since the Marketing and Pricing Principles Agreement allows a 20% return on
the par value of common shares only and not on retained earnings, and (ii) it
would reduce the present value of the dividends by deferring their payment.
B. Project Revenue and Profit
6.04       The financial analysis is done in current prices through 1981, and
in constant 1981 terms thereafter (Annex 6-1). It assumes that the Project
starts commercial operation on July 1, 1981, with a capacity utilization
increasing from 65% in the first year of operation to 85% in the second year,
and 90% in the third year and beyond. The financial analysis is done assuming
1/   For pricing purposes, design capacity is equal to 315 stream days per
year compared to an industry norm of 330 days.
2/   This limit will, however, be adjusted for changes in project scope which
are agreed to by the Government, as well as cost resulting from force
majeure events which are not within FFC's control and for which it
cannot take all reasonable preventive or corrective action.



- 24 -
a design capacity of 330 stream days per year, compared to only 315 stream
days used in the pricing formula; at 90% capacity utilization, the Project
will produce 512,300 tpy of urea.
6.05      According to Pakistani income tax rules, a capital intensive project
that operates three shifts per day, as the plant will, has the option to use
either straight-line or accelerated depreciation. FFC has opted for a 9%
straight-line depreciation for both book and tax purposes, and would thus
have to pay a corporate profit tax of 55% on its income from the first year.
6.06      Based on the estimated capital and operating costs, taxes and
profits, the ex-factory prices of urea are projected as follows (Annex 6-2
and 6-3):
FFC Projected Ex-Factory Prices of Bagged Urea /a
(in 1978 US dollars)
Year Ending June 30        1982     1983      1984      1985       1986     1991
Ex-Factory Price           239       185       173       171        168      153
Ex-Factory Price Net
of Income Taxes         198        153       144       141        138      124
/a   Based on total project financing requirements of US$260 million.
FFC's urea price during the first year of opeation is high compared to the
currently depressed landed prices of imports (US$165-170 per ton). This is
due to two reasons: First, unlike most other fertilizer projects which enjoy
accelerated tax depreciation allowances or tax holidays, FFC would pay taxes
from the first year of operation. Second, to provide FFC with enough liquid-
ity during the first year of operation, the price of urea is based on a
relatively low 65% capacity utilization. The 1982 ex-factory price net of
taxes (US$198 per ton in 1978 dollars) is, however, substantially in line
with the projected equivalent prices for imports in FFC's market area in 1982
(US$190 per ton) and below the projected equivalent prices (US$230 per ton)
forecast to be reached by 1985 when the current world excess supply situation
is expected to disappear (para 7.01).
6.07      FFC prices decline substantially from the second year as a result of
higher capacity utilization and lower financial charges. By the third year,
when the Project would be operating at 90% of capacity, ex-factory prices net
of taxes (US$144 per ton), are expected to be US$78 below projected equivalent
landed prices excluding duties of imports delivered in FFC's market area.
The ex-factory ceiling price (net of income tax), imposed by excluding cost
overruns above US$272 million from the pricing formula, would only be US$4-5
per ton above the corresponding price shown in the table above for a project
cost of US$260 million, and would, therefore, still be about US$70 per ton
lower than equivalent cost of imports.



- 25 -
C. Production Costs
6.08      Production costs per ton of urea, when the plant operates at 90%
of capacity, are estimated at about US$115 in 1978 terms; this is comparable
to other recent Bank financed fertilizer projects. Depreciation and finan-
cial charges account for about 53% of production costs, natural gas for 10%,
operating supplies and materials for 19%, and labor and overheads for the
remaining 18%. Details are contained in Annex 6-2.
D. Financial Projections

a/   Assuming a design capacity of 330 stream days per year.
6.10      The financial forecast shows that the pricing formula and lending
terms provide for a sound financial structure if FFC performs as expected.
As a result of high prices in the first year of operation, the Project would



- 26 -
generate enough cash to service its debt and maintain a comfortable liquidity
from the outset. The current ratio is maintained above 2.3 throughout the
Project's life. Debt service coverage does not drop below 1.6 even in 1983,
the first year of full loan repayment, and the debt/equity ratio falls from
70/30 at project start-up to below 50/50 during the sixth year of operation.
6.11      To ensure that FFC operates in a financially satisfactory manner,
FFC has agreed to:
(a) seek prior Association approval for additional investments in
fixed assets in excess of the equivalent of US$5 million in any
one fiscal year, or US$5 million plus the unutilized portion of
previous years subject to a maximum of US$15 million;
(b) take all necessary actions not to exceed at any time a debt
(including subordinated) to equity ratio of 70/30, and a debt
to equity of 60/40, when including subordinated debt as equity;
(c) not incur any additional debt if by so doing it could not
maintain a debt service coverage of at least 1.4 in any of
the succeeding fiscal years;
(d) maintain a current ratio of at least 1.5 at the project com-
pletion date, and thereafter of at least 1.2. Dividends will
be paid only out of accumulated net earnings and neither
dividends will be paid, nor any distribution with respect to
share capital made nor debt prepaid by FFC unless a current
ratio of at least 1.5 is maintained after such payments; and
(e) implement a satisfactory cost control, accounting and management
information system, which, inter alia, will provide information
to the Government suitable for pricing the Company's sales.
6.12      The profit break-even point for the Project in 1984, the first year
of full (90%) operation, is estimated at 60% of capacity; and the cash break-
even at 38%.  A break-even chart is provided in Annex 6-7.
E.  Financial Rate of Return
6.13      For the purpose of calculating the financial rate of return of the
Project, capital costs are used in 1978 terms; cost and benefit streams are
shown in Annex 6-8. The return is 20.9% before, and 13.6% after taxes. The
discounted yield on shareholders' investment, assuming the capital is fully
recovered at the end of the ten-year contract period, would be about 15.1% for
common shares and 12.6% for preferred shares. Results of sensitivity analyses
(Annex 6-9) are summarized below:



- 27 -
Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return after Taxes
Case                                 Percentage
1.  Base case                                   13.6
2.  Capital cost increase by 10%                11.8
3.  Capital cost increase by 20%                10.2
4.  12-month project delay                      11.5
5.  80% capacity utilization a/                 11.3
6.  100% capacity utilization a/                16.0
7.  Combination of (2) and (6)                  14.0
8.  Combination of (2) and (4)                  10.0
9.  Combination of (2), (4) and (5)              8.1
a/ Fromfi the third year onwards.
6.14      The rate of return is sensitive to changes in capital costs, capac-
ity utilization and delay in implementation.  A 12-month delay in project
implementation, combined with a 10% capital cost overrun and the eventual
attainment of only 80% capacity utilization, would reduce the return to 8.1%.
However, the likelihood that a combination of these events materialize is low,
particularly because of the involvement of experienced foreign partners and of
competent engineering firms.
F. Risks
6.15      The Project design is based on modern, commercially proven tech-
nology for economically efficient large-scale production, thus minimizing
technical and obsolescence risks; it is to be executed by well reputed
engineering firms with recent experience in constructing a very similar
plant at a location near the Project site and have the incentive to minimize
costs, and it will be managed by experienced partners who combine the know-
ledge of local conditions with technical and marketing experience and whose
return is sensitive to capital cost, project delay and capacity utilization.
The project capital cost estimate includes US$26.5 million for price escala-
tion, which should be adequate. But in view of the inflationary pressure in
Pakistan, a price escalation beyond that provided for cannot be totally ruled
out; therefore, financing for an additional US$11.7 million equivalent has
been secured on a stand-by basis to cover unforeseen cost overruns. The sales
risk is negligible and does not exceed the first three years of operation: by
1984, domestic production is expected to exceed demand by only 5%; if needed,
FFC's competitive cost would enable it to market any surplus in neighboring
countries where nitrogenous fertilizer deficiency is likely to persist in the
early 1980s.

VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Fertilizer and Raw Material Prices
7.01      During the late 1960s world fertilizer prices were depressed by
excess supply. Subsequent expansion in demand during the early 1970s was not
matched by increased capacities. The resulting scarcity, along with sharp
increases in the price of petroleum, led to substantial increases in urea
prices. The f.o.b. prices for urea peaked at US$350-400 per ton in August
1974 (from US$50-60 per ton in 1970), but have since declined to US$135-145
per ton. This decline is attributable to both the reduced imports of fer-
tilizer by countries which had accumulated substantial stocks during the panic
buying of 1973 in anticipation of further price increases, and the substantial
investments stimulated by high prices in 1973-74. An equilibrium between
supply and demand of nitrogenous fertilizers is expected to be reached by the
mid-1980s at which time the price of urea is likely to be determined by the
selling price from new natural gas based plants. On this basis, the f.o.b.
price of urea by 1985 is projected at US$203 per ton of bagged urea, expressed
in 1978 terms. Allowing for ocean freight, insurance and local port handling
of US$25 per ton, the projected long-term landed cost of urea to Pakistan
would be US$228 per ton in 1978 prices. Adjusting for the difference in
transport cost between the port and plant with respect to the main consuming
centers, the economic price for bagged urea at plant site by 1985 would be
about US$230 per ton for imported fertilizer.
7.02      The wellhead price of gas to FFC will be US$0.28 per MSCF (at 700
BTU per SCF). The opportunity cost of gas is taken at US$0.94 per MSCF (in
1978 prices) which is equivalent to US$1.29 per MSCF for 700 BTU per SCF gas
at consuming centers. On an energy equivalent basis, the latter figure
corresponds to a fuel oil price of US$70 per ton (in 1978 terms).
B. Economic Rate of Return
7.03      The economic analysis is based on 1978 dollar terms as shown in
Annex 7-1. Except for gas and urea, the opportunity costs of the Project's
inputs and outputs are based on financial costs adjusted for taxes. The
economic benefits of the Project are derived from import substitution and the
opportunity value of urea is taken as the amount of foreign exchange thus
saved. As noted in para 7.01, the economic price per ton of bagged urea for
domestic sales is assumed to increase from US$190 in 1982 to US$230 in 1985
and thereafter (in 1978 dollar terms). On the basis of a 12-year operating
life, the Project shows an economic rate of return of 22.7%, compared to the
13.6% financial rate of return. The difference between the two rates of
return indicates that the adjustment in the accounting price of gas is out-
weighed by the adjustment in price of urea and taxes paid to the Government.

7.04      As shown in the above table, the economic rate of return is sensi-
tive to changes in fertilizer prices and capital cost, delays in construction,
and lower capacity utilization. However, even under the unlikely combination
of the most adverse of the above circumstances, the economic rate of return
would remain satisfactory.
C. Foreign Exchange Effects
7.05      The average net annual foreign exchange savings attributed to the
Project are estimated at US$79 million in 1978 terms, after payment of divi-
dends to foreign shareholders and royalties and fees to Topsoe and Anic
(Annex 7-2). If FFC repeats the performance of the two joint Pakistan-US
fertilizer companies and operates at 100% capacity, the net foreign exchange
earnings would increase by US$11-12 million per year depending on whether the
additional output is exported or consumed locally.
D. Other Economic Benefits
7.06      The unquantified economic benefits of management training, assured
supplies of fertilizer, development of a strong marketing organization and
regional development add to the attractiveness of the Project.
VIII. AGREEMENTS
8.01      The following assurances and agreements were obtained from the
_Government, FFC, Fauji and Topsoe:
1.   from the Government, that it will:
a)   by September 30, 1978, agree with FFC on a fertilizer seeding
program, inter alia allowing FFC to obtain sufficient ferti-
lizer to effectively undertake such a program (para 3.18);
b)   guarantee the supply of gas to the Project and commit itself
not to sanction any new users of Mari gas until adequate
additional reserves are proven (para 4.03);



- 30 -
c)   take all necessary steps to insure that foreign exchange
is provided to meet the imports of parts and materials
needed for the efficient operation and maintenance of the
Project (para 4.06); and
d)   take all necessary steps to assure that all funds, including
foreign exchange, are provided as required to complete the
Project on terms satisfactory to the Association (para 5.11).
2.   from Fauji, that it will:
a)   not undertake, without IDA's prior approval, any new indus-
trial investments or expansion of existing industrial units,
whereby expenditures in an excess of an aggregate PRs 100
million would be incurred within the period ending one year
after the Project Completion Date (para 5.06); and
b)   submit its audited annual financial statements to the
Association in a timely manner (para 5.06).
3.   from Fauji and Topsoe, that they will
not sell or transfer any of their shares in FFC without IDA's
prior approval and will take all necessary measures to
ensure that FFC satisfactorily performs all its obligations
(para 5.07).
4.   from FFC, that it will:
a)   prior to plant start-up, undertake a two year fertilizer
seeding program satisfactory to IDA (para 3.18);
b)   ensure that operation of the plant will meet satisfactory
ecological, environmental and safety standards (para 4.08);
c)   prepare by December 31, 1978, and implement promptly, a
detailed training program acceptable to IDA (para 4.09);
d)   conduct its operations in a financially sound manner, by
maintaining a current ratio of 1.5 at project completion
and at least 1.2 thereafter; maintaining a debt/equity
ratio of at least 70:30, and 60:40 by including sub-
ordinated debt as equity; not incurring additional debt
if by doing so its debt service ratio would fall below
1.4; not paying dividends or prepaying debt if by doing
so its current ratio would fall below 1.5; and implement-
ing satisfactory cost control, accounting and management
information systems (para 6.11); and



- 31 -
e)   not make investments in fixed assets, outside the scope of
the Project, in excess of the equivalent of US$5 million
in any one fiscal year or US$5 million plus the unutilized
portion of previous years, subject to a maximum of US$15
million, without IDA approval (para 6.11).
8.02      The IDA Credit would become effective upon (i) subscription by all
shareholders of FFC's full share capital of the equivalent of US$81.6 million
(para 5.06); and (ii) execution of the agreements between FFC and AID, KfW,
IFU and IDB. Furthermore, disbursements in excess of US$2 million would be
made only after the agreements between FFC and AID, KfW, IFU, IDB and the
Governments of Denmark and Italy have become effective (para 5.12).
8.03      Based on the assurances received and agreements reached, the
Project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$55 million equivalent to be made
to the Government of Pakistan for on-lending to FFC at 10% interest for 15
years, including four years of grace.

their kinetics, the physical and chemical properties of
catalysts, the mechanism of catalytic processes, catalyst
activation procedures, stability of catalysts, effects of
poison, etc.
- Applied research relative to catalytic processes and new
catalysts to develop necessary data for engineering of
catalytic units and for application of catalysts in
existing industrial units.
- Specialized computer work applicable in the field of
research in heteregenous catalysis, engineering of catalytic
process units and analysis of performance of industrial units.
- Process engineering of catalytic industrial units and
associated equipment and complete plants incorporating such
units.
- Detailed engineering of such units.
- Supervisory engineering services during construction, start-
up and operation of catalytic units or complete plants.

3.        The major part of the company's engineering work is undertaken
in collaboration with others, either other engineering companies,
contractors or operating companies within the chemical processing
industry. It is possible for the Company to undertake complete detailed
engineering for a major project but this is rather an exception, and the
Company has been and is accordingly developing working relationships with
competent and experienced engineering contractors throughout the world.
4.        Haldor Topste A/S which employs about 450 people, mostly
engineers and university graduates licenses processes such as:
- Desulphurization of liquid hydrocarbons with EBP up to 240C,
based on gas-phase hydrogenation.
- Secondary desulphurization, for desulphurization of hydro-
carbons down to a sulphur level of 0.05 ppm.
- Tubular steam reforming of hydrocarbons, based on feed-
stocks ranging from refinery off-gas and natural gas all
the way up to naphtha with EBP of 2400.
- The HTAS/SBA autothermal reforming process, using as feed-
stock natural gas, LPG, or naphtha. In the HTSA/SBA unit
hydrocarbons are reacted with steam and air or oxygen to
form ammonia synthesis gas or oxo-gas.
- and others.
5.        The Company owns and operates catalyst plants in Denmark and the
U.S., and maintains an office in Brazil. It owns subsidiary companies in
the U.S., France, Sweden, Japan and Turkey (40% shareholding).

PAKISTAN: FAUJI FERTILIZER PROJECT
ANIC S.p.A.
1.        FFC has selected Anic S.p.A. (Anic) to operate and maintain the
FFC plant for a period of three years after start-up.
2.        Anic, which is part of the Italian state-owned Ente Nazionale
Idrocarburi (ENI) Group, is one of the largest Italian manufacturers
of chemicals and fertilizers. It has operations in fields ranging from
base to fine chemicals and with substantial interestsin sectors such as
fertilizers, synthetic rubber, plastics, chemical fibers and intermediate
chemical products. Its 1976 sales amounted to US$1.1 billion equivalent,
employing productive assets valued at US$1.0 billion. Anicts total
fertilizer capacity in Italy corresponds to a nitrogen content of 820,000
tons per year. Its 1978 production of plastics, synthetic rubbers, and
chemical fibers is estimated respectively at 900,000 tons, 360,000 tons
and 140,000 tons.
3.        Anic was founded in 1936 as a mixed company with public and
private capital. It was incorporated into ENI upon creation of the latter in
1953. Anic's first petrochemical plant, located at Ravenna, began opera-
tion in 1967 producing fertilizers and synthetic rubber. Since then the
company's activities have been expanding and growing rapidly. The
Company now operates 22 plants in Italy and 3 abroad. Fertilizers are
manufactured in four of the Italian locations. One of these,near
Manfredonia which has a capacity of 510,000 tpy of urea and 330,000 tpy
of ammonium sulfate and has started production in 1976, is largely identical
in concept and design with the FFC project.
4.        Due to the worldwide slack in demand for fertilizers in recent
years, Anic's expansion process has stagnated, and as a result, man-
power can be made available to projects such as FFC's. Given Anic's size--
it employs over 22,000 people--and its growing body of experience in Italy
and abroad, the company should have no difficulty in supplying the man-
power needs which it will require to perform its role as operating company
for FFC.
5.        FFC would be Anic's first fertilizer plant operation outside
Italy. However, the company has been operating, either as shareholders or
contractors, refineries and petrochemical plants in Ghana, Tunisia, Zambia
and other countries. In connection with these operations, it has developed
ample facilities for training foreigners at its Italian locations.
6.        The ENI Group, whose consolidated 1976 sales totaled the
equivalent of US$12.3 billion, ranks as number 18 in Fortune Magazine's
combined listings of the largest industrial enterprises within and outside
the United States. ENI's major fields of activity, with the respective major
subsidiaries and 1976 revenues, are as follows:

ANNEX 3-1
PAKISTAN: FAUJI FERTILIZER PROJECT
FERTILIZER CONSUMPTION
Past Trends
1.        The farmers in Pakistan used little fertilizer before 1960
(Table 2). The period up to 1965 was characterized by a rapid increase
in nitrogen consumption but hardly any phosphate or potassium was yet
applied in the fields. The farmers were given additional impetus to use
more fertilizers in the second half of the sixties through the intro-
duction of new, highly fertilizer responsive, wheat and rice varieties.
Between 1966 and 1973, total fertilizer consumption increased at an
average rate of about 30% per annum; this in spite of a set-back in 1971
when total nutrient use declined by 8% as a result of: a reduction in
the canal water availability and untimely rainfall, a fall in the benefit/
cost ratio as a result of fertilizer price increases and a considerable
reduction in the credit disbursements by the Agricultural Development
Bank of Pakistan (ADBP), the major institutional source of fertilizer cre-
dit. Some over-reporting and some advance purchases by farmers due to
temporary discounts in 1970, however, indicate that the 1971 decline in
fertilizer consumption is somewhat more apparent than real. This set-back
apart, the introduction of high yielding wheat and rice varieties (HYV's),
the increasing supplies of irrigation water, favorable fertilizer/crop
price ratios and increasing availability of institutional credit, all con-
tributed to the rapid increase in fertilizer consumption in the period
from the mid-sixties to the early seventies.
2.        In the early seventies the increase in fertilizer consumption lost
its momentum as the acreages under high yielding varieties stabilized and
increased at much lower rates than during the introductory period. The main
constraint on fertilizer consumption has since then been the availability of
irrigation water - practically all fertilizers are used in irrigated areas.
Between 1973 and 1975, there has been no increase in the availability of
water supply which has stagnated around 96 million acre feet (MAF) at the
farm gate. Fertilizer consumption also reached a peak in 1973 at 436.5
thousand tons of nutrient and then fell back to 403.4 thousand tons in
1974.
3.        The 1974 decline was only in nitrogen fertilizer consumption.
Phosphate usage, however, continued to increase though at a reduced rate.
The 1974 decline in nitrogen consumption can partly be ascribed to the
August 1973 floods, but mainly to the near doubling of the cost of ferti-
lizer to the farmers (reflecting the world shortage) without a correspond-
ing increase in crop prices. A contributing factor was also the Government
takeover of the fertilizer distribution system described elsewhere. A
tripling of fertilizer credit from the ADBP as a flood relief measure was
not enough to outweigh these negative factors.

ANNEX 3-1
Page 2
4.        The ratio of nitrogen to phosphate consumption (N:P ratio) in
1973 was 8:1, a much too high ratio for Pakistan conditions where soils
are deficient in phosphorus and the target ratio should be about 2:1.
The increase in phosphate consumption in 1974 against all the negative
factors that caused the decline in nitrogen use, is an indication that
phosphate usage in Pakistan was supply constrained. The reduction in aid
finance available for phosphate imports in 1971 and 1972 was a severe
check on phosphate consumption in those years. The large amount of aid-
financed DAP imports in 1973 eased the Pakistani phosphate supply situa-
tion in 1974. Although the doubling of phosphate prices reduced farmers
demand as compared to what it would have been otherwise, their purchases
were still larger than in the preceding year, 1973, when short supply had
left a lot of unsatisfied demand.
5.        The opposing effects of severe drought in the beginning of the
1975 season and an increase in wheat prices resulted in a partial recovery
of nitrogen consumption in 1975. Increase of water supply, improved
crop/fertilizer price ratios, improved dealer incentives through larger
marketing margins and a liberalization of fertilizer marketing allowed
a break-through in fertilizer consumption which, in aggregate, increased
by 30% in 1976, to 556,000 tons of nutrients of which N accounted
for 445,000 tons. The easy supply of phosphate and the de-restriction
to allow private marketing of the nutrient caused a jump in its use
which increased by more than 75% in 1976 to reach 109,000 tons of P205s
This improved the N:P ratio to 4.1:1. However, the commencement of the
private sector participation in the distribution of phosphates and the
resulting increase in the number of phosphate sales points, has required
a building up of a larger working stock than earlier. Some of the
increase in phosphate offtake, which is the proxy for consumption, is
therefore probably not reflected in a corresponding increase in actual
applications in farmers fields.
6.        Pakistan's fertilizer application rates per hectare of arable
land are still rather low as can be seen below and in Table 10:
Table 1

(kg of nutrient per ha)

7.        The development of the consumption of different types of ferti-
lizers is shown in Table 3.  Urea now accounts for about 85% of nitrogen
consumption and will be still more dominant when the new urea plants

ANNEX 3-1
Page 3
come on stream. There have been some critics of such a high share of
nitrogenous fertilizers being supplied by urea. It was argued that urea
was not as good a nitrogen carrier for Pakistan conditions as other
sources of this nutrient. The mission has reviewed this problem and not
found urea less effective than other nitrogenous fertilizers if properly
applied.
8.       That urea gives good responses is supported by Pakistani
agronomists and FAO trials. For the three major agricultural provinces,
Punjab, Sind and NWFP, under irrigated conditions, FAO trials show
average responses to nitrogen ranging from 10 to 12.5 units of wheat per
unit of N (Table 4). The relatively low response factor of 3.8 for
Baluchistan shown in the table is attributed to inadequate water supply
under the traditional khareez systems. The nutrient sources for the
trials were not specified. Similarly, the average response of IRRI rice
ranged from 8 to 17 units of paddy per unit of N (Table 5). All trials
were conducted by FAO 1967 to 1970 in farmers' fields, and the prevailing
agricultural practices were followed.
9.       In the same FAO project, the efficiency of different nutrient
sources were compared for major crops. The results of 1,154 trials on
wheat and 433 trials on rice are shown in Tables 6 and 7. For wheat, one
can see no disadvantage of urea as a nitrogen source. Ironically enough,
since urea is commonly known as a fertilizer particularly good for rice,
ammonium sulphate seems to have a slight edge over urea on rice. This
may, however, be due to the difference in the phosphate source also. At
any rate, the considerable advantages in production and distribution
economics in favor of urea by far outweigh the non-significant biases in
favor of other nitrogen carriers that may be shown in Tables 6 and 7.
It appears, therefore, that on the whole, the issue of the efficiency of
urea as a nitrogen carrier amounts to the problem of assuring that urea
is properly applied. This is essentially the task of the extension
services.

Prospects
10.       Taking account of all factors which had been identified as being
the main determinants to changes in fertilizer consumption in the past, the
Bank has made an assessment for the likely market development for nitrogen
and phosphate fertilizers. The forecasts are shown in Table 8. Table 9
shows the forecasts made by some other organizations.
11.       Increased water supply, improved credit facilities and crop/
fertilizer price ratios, the backlog in demand experienced in recent years
of shortages, all this is expected to continue to lead to above average
growth rates in nitrogen consumption in the next year or so. Gradually,
however, as these gains are realized, the growth rate is expected to slow
down from 19% in 1977 to about 9% by 1980 and 5 to 6% thereafter. The
average growth rate between 1975 and 1980 is forecast to be about 15% as
compared to nearly 17% between 1969 and 1973. The level of nitrogen con-
sumption is forecast to increase from 445 in 1976 to 730 in 1980 and 980
in 1985, all in thousand tons of nutrient.
12.       The projections are consistent with planned increases in water
supply. Any shortfall can have serious effects on fertilizer consumption.
As mentioned, the recent Bank Special Agricultural Sector Review concluded
that only 55 to 60% of the water required for maximum yields is available.
This would reduce the yield potential by some 20 to 25%. In addition, the
variability in the monthly supply means that the farmers cannot rely on and
plan for more than 40 to 45% of water requirements corresponding to a
reduction in the yield potential by some 35 to 50%.
13.       The FAO trials show that dwarf wheat gives near maximum yield at
fertilizer application rates of about 200-100-100 lbs/acre. The average
recommended dosage is about 120-60-0 which, however, assumes that adequate
water is available. Due to the risk involved in higher application rates
because of the non-assured availability of water, the farmers, on average,
would be reluctant to exceed an application rate of the order of 80-40-0.
This has been taken account of in the Bank's projections which assume that
the application rate on wheat increases from 45-10-0 in 1974/75 to 80-20-0
in 1979/80 and 85-30-0 in 1984/85 (see Tables 10 and 11). Similar assump-
tions were made for other crops accounting for about 50% of fertilizer
consumption, and the projected application rates for 1980 and 1985 are
consistent with the fLndings of the agricultural sector mission. Table 12
shows that if the recommended fertilizer application rates were followed,
the potential use of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers in 1980 would be
about 1.3 million tons of N and about 0.7 million tons of P205.
14.       Exclusive of fertilizer demand induced through acreage increases
or technological progress, these figures would seem, for practical purposes,
to put an upper limit towards which fertilizer consumption in Pakistan would
grow at a decreasing rate.

ANNEX 3-1
Page 9
15.       Assuming that the Bank's fertilizer consumption projections are
realized and that crop acreages increase as shown in Table 10, it can then
be roughly estimated that cereal (wheat, rice and maize) production can
increase at a yearly rate of more than 5% in the latter half of the
seventies, and at about 4% in the first half of the eighties. This
assumes a response ratio of 7 units of cereals per additional unit of
nutrient applied. This is obviously a rough and ready method of calcu-
lation, but it would seem to allow the conclusion that food supply per
capita in Pakistan will improve significantly if the Bank's fertilizer
demand projections are correct.
16.       Forecast phosphate fertilizer demand (Table 8) is based on the
target to improve the N:P ratio from 6:1 in 1975 to about 4:1 in 1980
and 3:1 in 1985. The final goal should be about 2:1. There now seems
to be general acceptance in Pakistan that the N:P ratio has to be improved.
As a step in that direction, GOP has recently given permission to the
fertilizer industry to distribute phosphate fertilizers. This was earlier
entirely in Government hands. GOP also fixes the P205 price relatively
more favorably than that of N. Moreover, to promote the use of NP and DAP,
these materials are cheaper sources of nitrogen and phosphate than straight
fertilizers. The effect of all this has been that phosphate consumption
increased by three-quarters in 1976 and already improved the N:P ratio
to 4.1:1. It has already been mentioned that the 1976 phosphate offtake
figure probably overestimates actual consumption due to increases in retail
stocks. It is therefore believed that the 4:1 ratio forecast for 1980 is
still a reasonable one.
17.       Pakistan soils are generally not deficient in potash and no
effort has been made to forecast future consumption of this nutrient.

FERTILIZER PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCE
The Existing Fertilizer Industry
1.       The manufacture of fertilizers in Pakistan was first taken up by
the Government-owned Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC),
which established three factories between 1958 and 1962. By 1973, PIDC
had grown too large and was split into ten specialized corporations
coordinated through a Board of Industrial Management. The National
Fertilizer Corporation (NFC) took over PIDC's fertilizer operations and
was incorporated as a private limited company wholly owned by GOP. NFC
acts as a holding company to the operating units directing, coordinating
and controlling the group activities.
2.        Esso Pakistan Fertilizer Company Ltd. built the first private
fertilizer factory in the private sector in 1968 and was followed by the
Bank/IFC financed joint venture Dawood Hercules in 1972. Historical and
projected production of nitrogenous fertilizer is shown in Table 13. The
existing fertilizer plants are shown in the table below:

3.      Nitrogen:  The NFC subsidiary Pak-American Fertilizer Ltd. started
up Pakistan's first nitrogen fertilizer plant with USAID assistance in
1958. Its location was at Daudkhel in Northern Punjab. Initially the
factory was designed for 40 tons per day (tpd) ammonia to be fully con-
verted to 150 tpd of ammonium sulphate. This corresponds to about 10
thousand tons per year (330 days) of nitrogen (10 MtpyN). In 1968, the
plant was expanded and an additional 36 tpd (10 MtpyN) ammonia was processed
and added 123 tpd (8 MtpyN) to the ammonium sulphate capacity. The raw
materials for the project were coal and gypsum until 1973 when gas became
available via the Sui Northern pipeline and the plant was modified to use
natural gas instead of coal. Until the modification, part of the ammonia
had been used for refrigeration and defense purposes and this, together
with plant modifications plus fuel and other problems, had restricted the
annual ammonium sulphate output to 60,000 tons or so (12 MtpyN) which was
about two-thirds of its nominal capacity. After the modification to
natural gas, the plant produced about 91,000 tons of ammonium sulphate
in 1974 and about 94,000 tons in 1975. This is a very satisfactory
result and about 4% above the rated capacity of 90,000 tons in 1975.
4.       Another NFC project, now part of the Pak-Arab Fertilizers Ltd.
plant at Multan in Central Punjab started production in 1962. The complex
was built with French financial assistance and originally consisted of a
204 tpd (56 MtpyN) double stream ammonia unit to feed a 180 tpd (27 MtpyN)
urea unit and a 300 tpd (26 MtpyN) Calcium Amnonium Nitrate (CAN)-1anit.---
The ammonia units have never achieved more than about 75% of design capa-
cities. In 1968, an "Ammopac" 60 tpd (16 MtpyN) packaged ammonia plant was
installed to make up for the deficiency, but this unit has also not worked
properly. The complex never managed to increase its urea and CAN output
over the levels achieved before the installation of the Ammopac unit. Like
the Daudkhel plant, the Multan plant uses gas from the Sui field as its
raw material for ammonia production. As detailed below, the Multan plant
is now being expanded with Bank assistance.
5.        In the private sector, Esso Pakistan Fertilizer Ltd. brought on
stream a prilled urea plant in Northern Sind based on Mari gas.  The plant
commenced operation in 1968 and consists of a 300 tpd (82 MtpyN) ammonia
unit and a 515 tpd (78 MtpyN) urea unit.  Esso's urea output has consis-
tently exceeded the design capacity, in 1975 by as much as 20%.  These
production levels can be achieved because of Esso's recent major invest-
ments in debottlenecking the plant.
6.       In 1971, Dawood Hercules brought into operation a 620 tpd (169 MtpyN)
ammonia unit and a 1,100 tpd (167 KtpyN) urea plant. The Bank, IFC and USAID
provided financial assistance for the project which is lceated at Chichoki-
Mallian not far from Lahore in Eastern Punjab near the Indian border. Its
ammonia production is based on Sui gas. Apart from interruptions due to
hostilities and one or two mechanical failures, the plant has demonstrated
its capability of operating at near or above its design capacity.

7.        Phosphate:  Pakistan's first fertilizer plant, the NFC Lyallpur
Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd. small plant at Faisalabal in the Punjab
started production in 1957. It then consisted of a 20 tpd sulphuric
acid plant and a 60 tpd (3.5 Mtpy P205) Single Superphosphate (SSP) den.
In 1968, a first expansion of Lyallpur Chemicals' facilities were made
at Jaranwala about 35 km from Lyallpur. Another expansion at Jaranwala
was completed at the end of 1975 and the Jaranwala Complex now consists
of two 50 tpd sulphuric acid plants to produce 240 tpd (14 Mtpy P205) of
SSP. The Lyalipur Chemicals' facilities have operated at low rates of
capacity utilization both because the sulphuric acid has been used for
other purposes and the farmers' reluctance to handle powdered SSP.
Jordan rock, and sulphur currently imported from Poland, are the raw
materials for these plants.
Fertilizer Capacity Expansion Program
8.        Present plans for the expansion of public sector (NFC) ferti-
lizer capacity include new facilities for the Pak-Arab plant at Multan,
and the Pak-Saudi project at Mirpur Mathelo. In the private sector, there
is the proposed FFC project.
9.        The Multan expansion program, financed with Bank and ADB assis-
tance, consists of the construction of: a 910 tpd (246 MtpyN) ammonia
unit based on Sui gas, a double stream nitric acid unit with a capacity
of 1,200 tpd (100% nitric acid basis), a nitrophosphate plant producing
1,020 tpd prilled 22.5-22.5-0 (75 Mtpy each of N and P205) and a 1,500
tpd CAN (26.5% N) plant (119 MtpyN). The existing urea and CAN plants,
after modification to produce 218 tpd (33 MtpyN) prilled urea and 300
tpd (26 MtpyN) granular CAN will be integrated with the new units. The
old double stream ammonia units will probably be mothballed or scrapped
whereas the Ammopac unit is likely to continue to serve in one way or
another but its ammonia probably will not be used for fertilizer produc-
tion. The Multan project is now expected to be in commercial production
by latel978. It is based on Sui gas and Jordan phosphate rock.
10.       The Pak-Saudi project at Mirpur Mathelo in the Sind is being built
with ADB and Arab assistance and consists of a 1,000 tpd (272 MtpyN)
ammonia unit and a 1,740 tpd (264 MtpyN) urea unit. Like the proposed
FFC project, it is based on gas from the Mari gas field. It is
expected to be on stream by latel979.
11.       Finally, among the active projects, we have the one proposed
for IDA financing, the FFC plant to be located at Goth Machhi to pro-
duce 1,000 tpd (272 MtpyN) ammonia to be converted into 1,725 tpd
(262 MtpyN) of urea. As mentioned elsewhere, it is expected to be in
commercial production in mid-1981.
12.       In addition, NFC planned to build a nitrogen and phosphate com-
plex at Haripur in Hazara district, NWFP, with the assistance of China.
The plant was to produce 170 tpd (46 MtpyN) ammonia and 290 tpd (44 MtpyN)
urea. Although some work has started on the site, the project has been
postponed indefinitely.

13.       There were also plans to build a phosphate complex consisting
of a 750 tpd sulphuric acid plant based on imported sulphur, a 300 tpd
(99 Mtpy P205) phosphoric acid plant based on rock from the Hazara
deposits, a 750 tpd sulphuric acid plant based on imported sulphur, a
615 tpd (55 Mtpy P205) urea ammonium phosphate (UAP) plant and a triple
superphosphate plant of unspecified size but presumably to use the
remaining 44 Mtpy P205 in phosphoric acid not used by the UAP plant.
Due to the delayed results from the survey of the Hazara rock deposits,
and the uncertainty with regard to these deposits, the phosphate projects
have been postponed; their future is uncertain.

Fertilizer Supply/Demand Balances
14.       Historical and forecast production of nitrogenous fertilizers is
shown in Table 13. In the past, single superphosphate (SSP) was the only
phosphate fertilizer manufactured in Pakistan and, in recent years, output
averaged about 4,000 tons of P205 per annum. With the coming on stream of
the Jaranwala plant, 1977 production increased to 10,000 tons. Table 14
shows the forecast phosphate fertilizer production.
15.       As can be seen in Tables 15 and 16, Pakistan has been relying
heavily on imports to fill its nutrient requirements. With the dramatic
increases in international fertilizer prices, fertilizer imports have
become a severe burden on Pakistan's balance of payments. For example,
it is estimated that fertilizer imports during 1977 cost Pakistan about
US$110 million, which represented about 5% of their total import bill.
The cost of urea imports alone amounted to nearly US$50 million that year.
16.       Due to the heavy import dependence, the international fertilizer
price hikes were immediately reflected on the nutrient prices in Pakistan.
For example, the price of urea doubled from Rs 700 ($71) per ton in 1972 to
Rs 1,500 ($152) per ton in 1973. This compares to local production costs
averaging about Rs 800 ($81). The USA domestic price for urea was $82 per
ton in 1972 and $230 per ton in 1974.
17.       The external price effects had serious repercussions on
Pakistan's fertilizer consumption which stagnated until crop prices were
adjusted sufficiently upwards and fertilizer prices began to decline again
in 1976. Although difficult to quantify, the stagnation of fertilizer
consumption in the 1972-1975 period was certainly a major factor in the
doubling of the level of foodgrain imports during that same period, just
as the rapid increase in fertilizer consumption in the late sixties was a
major factor in bringing Pakistan close to food self-sufficiency in 1969-70.
18.       With the implementation of the proposed FFC project, Pakistan
will be assured of a stable supply of fertilizers at prices reflecting produc-
tion costs in Pakistan. According to the Bank's projections, Pakistan would
become self-sufficient in fertilizers between 1981 and 1984 with the FFC
plant. This would be a small margin as a buffer against unforeseen
events like slippage in the completion of new fertilizer plants, plant
breakdowns and other reasons for lower than expected (90%) capacity utili-
zation, higher than forecast consumption and necessary stock build-up. Any
remaining small surpluses should not be too difficult to sell or barter
elsewhere in Asia. Competitive production costs, experienced foreign
companies like Esso and Hercules should be an asset in finding
foreign markets. A small surplus margin would also give an extra incentive
for an intensification of the fertilizer promotional effort. Table 17
shows the forecast supply and demand balances of nitrogen fertilizers in
Pakistan.
19.       The supply and demand forecasts for phosphate fertilizers (Table
18) show deficits throughout the period under review and local phosphate
fertilizer production might seem justified. It is not clear, however, what
the phosphate rock availability in Pakistan is. A survey of the Hazara
deposits is now being undertaken and results could be expected by the end
of 1978. Phosphate fertilizer production in Pakistan based on imported
sulphur and rock does not appear to be an economic proposition, particularly
in view of falling international prices of finished phosphate fertilizers.

FERTILIZER MARKETING
Fertilizer Pricing and Price Policies
1.       GOP gives high priority to fertilizers and has strict control over
the sector on the strength of the Essential Commodities Act.
2.       Fertilizer ceiling retail prices, as well as procurement prices of
the major crops, are fixed by the Government and therefore provide it with
an important policy instrument. These prices are uniform throughout the
country. Cost differentials between imported and locally produced ferti-
lizers are made up for through levies or subsidies. The retail price of
urea and SSP are fixed first and then the other straight fertilizer materials
are priced to equate the price per unit of N and P205 respectively. To
achieve a better N:P balance, the Government subsidizes P205 at a higher rate
than N. Moreover, to promote the sales of DAP and particularly NP, these
materials are cheaper sources of nitrogen and phosphate than straight ferti-
lizers. Thus, for example, in 1975, imported TSP was subsidized at a rate
of Rs 6,700 per ton of nutrient compared to imported urea's Rs 4,000 per ton
of nutrient (Table 21). The present retail price of NP (24-24-0) is about
13% below the corresponding weighted prices of urea and TSP.
3.       Since 1972, GOP has gradually increased fertilizer prices (Table 19).
Urea, for example, has increased in stages from Rs 700/ton in 1972 to Rs 1,500/
ton in 1974. Although GOP also increased procurement prices for major agri-
cultural crops such as wheat, rice, cotton and sugarcane, the increases were
not in proportion to fertilizer price increases and the benefit/cost ratios
suffered considerably as shown in the table below:
Benefit/Cost Ratios for Fertilizer Application 1972-771'
1972     1973      1974     1975      1976      1977

Rice, coarse       3.3      3.3       2.0       2.3      2.5       1.9
Wheat              2.6      2.9       1.9       2.1      2.3       2.4
Maize              2.8      3.1       1.9       2.4      2.5       3.2
Cotton             6.8      7.2       5.3       3.7      5.6       6.1
Sugarcane          5.4      6.2       4.6       4.3      5.2       5.2
1/  Benefit/cost ratios are calculated by taking the physical
response of each crop per unit of nutrient application, and multi-
plying it by the ratio of the price of output and the cost of
fertilizer input. The physical response rates used are: wheat,
maize and rice, 7:1, sugarcane, 10:1, cotton (seed), 6:1.



ANNEX 3-3
Page 2
4.       In 1976, fertilizer prices were reduced and prices of some cash
crops increased thus resulting in an improvement in the benefit/cost
ratios, but those for cereals are still considerably below the levels
obtained in 1972. The 1974-75 slowdown in fertilizer ccnsumption was
largely due to deteriorating benefit/cost ratios.
5.       Farmers react more strongly to changes in fertilizer prices than
to corresponding changes in crop prices, at least in the short term. This
seems to be supported also by an Esso inquiry in 1974 (Table 20). Also, a
study carried out by Dr. Ahmad Saeed Khan at the University of Agriculture
in Lyallpur found that, certeris paribus, an increase in wheat prices by
20% increased fertilizer consumption on wheat by only 22%, whereas a reduc-
tion of the fertilizer price by 20% gave rise to an increased consumption
of as much as 46%.
6.       In view of the price elasticity of demand for fertilizers, the
Government should review fertilizer and crop procurement prices in order
to assure that fertilizer consumption increases at desired rates and is
consistent with its food and agricultural production targets.
7.       The Government also reviews the production and marketing costs
for each fertilizer producer in Pakistan, and fixes their ex-factory price
and distribution margin. If the allowed production and marketing costs
add up to more than the ceiling retail price, the Government subsidizes
the company to cover the difference. If the same cost adds up to less
than the ceiling price, which is the case for nearly all locally produced
fertilizers at present, then the difference is levied on the company as a
"development surcharge". Whenever there is a fertilizer glut, actual
prices paid by farmers are generally somewhat below the ceiling prices.
There is thus a certain price competition in which the local producers
feel that they are not given fair treatment. In fact, the Government
allows a higher marketing margin ex rail for imported than for locally
produced fertilizers. This makes it possible to give a larger discount on
imported nutrients. Tables 21 and 22 show that, for example, locally pro-
duced urea after recent increases is given a total marketing margin between
ex factory cost and the ceiling retail price of Rs 101 to Rs 129 per ton
for the various factories. This compares to a margin of Rs 320 for
imported urea.
8.        Although fertilizer prices have gone up considerably, the commis-
sions paid to retail dealers was set, until recently, at Rs 22 per ton of
urea. This represented about 1.5% of the cost of the fertilizer to cover
handling and transport charges from railhead to shop, storage and other
shop costs and profit. To improve this situation, GOP raised this margin
successively, until in 1977 it reached Prs 40 per ton for urea. With the
reduced urea price, this now represents 3% of the fertilizer cost to the
consumer, a level still considered inadequate to provide sufficient incentive
for the dealer to actively promote sales of fertilizer at a time when
locally produced supplies are expected to grow rapidly. GOP has agreed to
review these dealer incentives, to provide the Association by October 31,
1978, with the results of its review and its recommendations for adjustment,
and to implement such adjustment, as agreed with IDA, by December 31, 1978.

The Fertilizer Planning Committee
9.       Substantial progress has been made during 1975-76 to improve the
farmer's incentive to use more fertilizer, to improve the dealer's incen-
tive to sell more fertilizer and to streamline the fertilizer distribution
system (see below section on Fertilizer Distribution). In addition to a
continued tuning of the general variables affecting fertilizer consumption,
future major gains would come from selective measures aimed at certain tar-
get groups, in particular the small farms. Such incentives, however,
require more data and, a coordinated effort to collect and analyze new
data permitting detailed central planning therefore seems called for.
USAID, the UNDP and others make considerable but uncoordinated and, there-
fore to some extent, overlapping efforts to provide new planning data. A
GOP-sponsored Fertilizer Planning Committee has been set up to review and
coordinate the various activities in the fertilizer sector and will greatly
contribute towards a better understanding, and hence a more optimum
development of the sector. At present, responsibility for fertilizer
planning is scattered between various Ministries and public and private
agencies and arrangements for coordinating their decisions are lacking.
The objectives of the new Committee are:
A. To review and coordinate fertilizer policies and
programs and make recommendations for improvements.
B. To lead and coordinate the collection and analysis
of a sound data base for fertilizer planning.
C. To explore alternative organizational frameworks
for the permanent coordination of fertilizer planning.
10.      In somewhat more detail, the scope of the committee's
work includes, but is not limited, to:
Under A.
i)  review farmer's incentives to use fertilizer, dis-
tinguishing different groups of farmers characterized
by size of farm, water supply conditions, cropping
patterns, and other characteristics that affect the
individual incentives. Relate this to existing crop/
fertilizer price structures and propose improvements
consistent with plan production and social targets.
ii) review the efficiency of the fertilizer distribution
system giving particular attention to marketing mar-
gins and sales promotion incentives in the system.
Make recommendations for improvements.
iii) review existing credit programs and targets, compare
them with credit requirements and make recommendations
for improvements, giving particular attention to the
small and poor farmers' problems.

ANNEX 3-3
Page 8
iv) review other policies and programs affecting fertilizer
use.
Under B.
i) establish what information and data is required for
effective fertilizer planning and in what form it should
be available.
ii) make an inventory of existing data and ongoing efforts
to generate and analyze new data.
iii) coordinate ongoing data collection efforts and assure
the collection of missing data.
iv) make proposals with regard to the periodic updating of
the data base.
Under C.
i) review existing institutions in fertilizer planning and
determine to what extent such planning is hampered by
lack of coordination, overlapping, badly defined areas
of competence, etc.
ii) develop proposals for institutional arrangements per-
mitting effective coordination of fertilizer planning
and initiation of policy changes.
11.       The Committee is expected to be credible and effective since
all major groups with an interest in the fertilizer sector are repre-
sented. The Central Government is the sponsor of the Committee which
is chaired by a GOP official. The Committee furthermore includes
representatives from the various secretariats interested in the fertilizer
sector, representatives from the provincial governments, fertilizer
industry, fertilizer distributors and consumers, transportation and others
concerned with fertilizer policy. The recently established UNDP/FAO
Fertilizer Development Center will be geared to providing an important
part of the secretariat support needed for the Committee.
12.       The Government has prepared the detailed terms of reference for
the Fertilizer Planning Committee which are acceptable to IDA.

Fertilizer Credit
13.       Next to water, the cash required to buy fertilizers is the
most important constraint on fertilizer consumption. The money require-
ments to buy fertilizers can either be reduced through the lowering of
fertilizer prices or be met through credit. The main sources for
institutional agricultural credit in Pakistan are: The Agricultural
Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP), the Cooperatives and the Commercial
Banks.
14.       GOP gives high priority to agricultural credit.  Disbursements
increased from Rs 330 million in 1973 to Rs 1 billion in 1975. Targets
increased from Rs 1.7 billion in 1976 to an annual average of Rs 2.5
billion during 1977 to 1981. 90% of this is targeted for small and med-
ium farmers. How much of this will go to fertilizer is impossible to
say but for the major institutional agricultural credit source, the
Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP), their share has been
decreasing from 30% in 1974 to just under 15% in 1976. It is further
estimated that about 65% of the agricultural loans made by the commercial
banks and about 20% of the cooperative loans were for fertilizer.
15.       There is not much data aVailable on credit extended for ferti-
lizers in Pakistan. The best data available is that collected by several
USAID sponsored surveys including preliminary results from the on-going
NFC/USAID Survey on Fertilizer Distribution and Credit. Tables 23 to 29
summarize the data:
- Tenants use more credit for fertilizers than owner-
operators (Table 23);
- Medium farms (15-25 acres) buy more fertilizers on
credit than small and very large farms (Table 24);
- Non-availability of credit is a considerable con-
straint on fertilizer use, more so for small than
large farmers (Table 25);
- Farmers perceived credit needs to increase considerably
(1972) over actual credit obtained (1971) (Table 26);
- 71% of the farmers were current fertilizer users but
20% of the non-users had used fertilizer before
(Table 27);
- 45% of the users had borrowed money for their ferti-
lizer purchases but only 4% had used institutional
credit; the remaining 41% having borrowed money from
their landlords, families, friends, dealers, etc.
(Tables 28 and 29).

16.       The State Bank of Pakistan is the primary source of funds for
ADBP's agricultural credit operations. It currently provides funds to ADBP
at an interest rate of 7% per year, which is 2% less than the ruling bank
rate in Pakistan. ADBP relends the funds to farmers through about 115
branches throughout the country. The current interest rates charged by
ADBP for short-term loans are 10% per year for loans up to Rs 5,000 and 11%
for loans above Rs 5,000. The State Bank of Pakistan is also the main
source of funds for the cooperative societies. Funds are made available by
the State Bank of Pakistan at 7% per year to the provincial cooperative
banks, which relend the funds to the secondary cooperative banks at 7.5% per
year. The secondary cooperative banks in turn relend the funds at 8 to 8.5%
per year to the primary cooperative societies, which finally extend credit
to farmers at interest rates ranging from 9 to 12% per year.
17.       Commercial banks first entered into agricultural credit operations
in 1972. By the end of March 1975, there were more than 4,000 branches of
commercial banks spread all over the country. The current lending rate of
the commercial banking system for fertilizer credits is 12% per year, and
the banks derive funds for such operations from saving account deposits of
their customers for which they pay an interest of normally 6% per year.
The commercial banks can also secure funds from the State Bank at 9% per
year. To ensure adequate distribution of available credits to small farmers,
the commercial banks are statutorily obliged to extend 70% of all their agri-
cultural loans to farmers with holdings of less than 12.5 acres.
18.       Under a credit guarantee arrangement, the State Bank shares with
the commercial banks on a 50:50 basis any bonafide losses on agricultural
credit operations. However, due to the good recovery rates of loans
extended by the commercial banking system, no claim for reimbursement under
such guarantee arrangements has thus far been filed by any commercial bank.
In contrast, about 50% of ADBP loans are said to be in default.  Similarly,
the repayment situation of the majority of cooperatives is considered very
unsatisfactory. To remedy matters, ADBP recently appointed special recovery
agents for branches with heavy arrears, and each branch was assigned an
officer exclusively for recovering loans.
19.       The major constraint on increased lending for fertilizers is the
difficulty in reaching, in particular, the small farmer. To simplify the
lending procedures, GOP, in 1973, introduced a scheme for issuing credit pass-
books to farmers. Each passbook will contain details of the land held by the
passbook holder, valuation of the land and encumbrances, and will be used to
record the status of the loans advanced to the holder. The purpose of the
scheme is to facilitate farmers in obtaining credit. It was originally
planned to issue passbooks to 25% of the farmers each year so that after four
years, the target of 4.8 million passbooks would have been issued. However,
in one-and-a-half years, only about 150,000 passbooks were issued. A drive
to speed up the issue of passbooks is in progress. It is yet unclear to
what extent passbooks have benefitted the small farmer.

20.       The ADBP has introduced the "Village Banker" scheme where one
farmer of the village will be trained to act as a representative of the
ADBP. The target in a pilot effort is to reach 500 villages by the end
of 1976. It is hoped that this scheme will provide an answer to ADBP's
difficulty in reaching the farmers and reverse the trend in its ferti-
lizer lending which has decreased from Rs 113 million in 1973/74 to Rs 80
million in 1975/76.
21.       The National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) has also an interesting
pilot program for small farmer credit. This program was initiated on
a test basis in 1972, it had up to June 1976 disbursed Rs 176 million
for production purposes, mainly for fertilizer. It now serves 2,383
villages. Recoveries have been satisfactory, but the program is not cover-
ing its cost at 12% interest.

The Fertilizer Distribution System
a. The Distribution Network
23.       Between 1953 and 1967 all fertilizer importation and distribution
down to the wholesale level was carried out by the Central Government of
Pakistan. Private trade was only involved at the retail level as dealers
to Government wholesalers.
24.       In 1967 four large private enterprises, Esso, Dawood-Hercules
(DH), Pakistan National Oil (PNO) and Jaffer Brothers, were appointed
"principal agents" for the marketing and distribution of both locally pro-
duced and imported fertilizers. The market share of the private trade
increased rapidly to reach nearly 80%, employing some 2,000 dealers.
25.       During the international shortage of fertilizers in 1973, the
Government decided that, based on past consumption, each province was to
be given a fixed percentage of locally produced fertilizers and the same
share of imported fertilizers as shown below:

26.       On July 1, 1973, the control of fertilizer distribution was trans-
ferred from the Federal Government to the Provincial Governments.  importation
of fertilizers remained the responsibility of the Federal Directorate of Agri-
cultural Supplies (FDAS). The Provincial Governments to a varying degree took
over wholesaling and retailing of fertilizers earlier in private hands. A
drastic reduction in the number of retailers was the result, contributing to
the slowdown or even reduction in fertilizer consumnti4n descrVbed etrtier.
27.       The Governments of Punjab and Sind set up their own marketing
organizations; Punjab Agricultural Supplies and Development Corporation
(PASDC) and Sind Agricultural Supplies Corporation (SASCO). In Punjab, 677. of
the prorated fertilizer market, PASDC took over both wholesale and retail
trade of imported fertilizers, output from Government owned (NFC) plants and
50% of Punjab's prescribed share of the output from the DH plant. Esso
defended successfully its right to distribute its own output on the strength



- 89 -
ANNEX 3-3
Page 16
of a provision in its investment agreement with GOP. In Sind (22.5% of
consumption), SASCO had taken over 54% of the wholesale trade (46% is with
Esso), but most retailing was made by private dealers. SASCO was also
handling the distribution of fertilizers in Baluchistan (1.5% of consumption).
Fertilizer distribution in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP, 9% con-
sumption) was left unchanged with 23% of wholesale trade in Government hands
and most retail trade through private dealers. Table 31 summarizes the
fertilizer distribution system as it was before a new, still on-going,
process of change started.
28.       On October 5, 1975, GOP announced significant changes in its
fertilizer marketing policy, in particular:
1. Territorial marketing restrictions introduced in 1973
were removed for domestic producers.
2. Private sector distribution were given a share in phos-
phate fertilizer marketing in relation to their nitrogen
sales.
3. Licensing of dealer applicants was liberalized to the
point of becoming nearly automatic.
4. Private dealers were given access to supplies from both
private and public wholesalers.
5. Retail margins were increased.
29.       These actions lead to an increase in the number of fertilizer
retailers from about 2,300 in 1975 to about 3,700 in 1976. About two-thirds
are in the private sector, where most of the expansion took place. This
includes NFC which is setting up its own marketing organization and thus
gradually taking over from PASDC.
30.       Although, in principle, the prorating of markets was removed
for domestic producers, the PADSCO-DH arrangement was to remain unless
changed through mutual agreement of the two parties. After negotiations in
July 1976, PADSCO now markets 29% of DH sales in the Punjab compared to the
earlier 44%. Graph I shows the present distribution system.
31.       For imported fertilizers, the individual shipments are still dis-
patched according to the old prorated share of each province. Thus, of each
shipment, in principal, the Punjab gets 67%, the Sind 22.5%, NWFP 9% and
Baluchistan 1.5%. The strict prorating of fertilizer supplies from each
source to earmarked provinces was a measure introduced during a period of
shortage and was intended to guarantee that all the provinces received their
fair share of supplies. Now that fertilizer supplies are ample, this system
is unnecessarily rigid and contributes to increased costs, in particular,
for transportation. It also increases the load on the railway system which,
in peak periods, is already unable to supply the capacity requirements. GOP
should continue to liberalize fertilizer trade particularly where some of
the present restrictions hardly have any justification any more.

b. Storage
32.       Imported fertilizers are mostly loaded at Karachi port into
waiting rail wagons and moved directly to the market towns. From
different reports, it appears that the fertilizer storage capacity at
Karachi port is 10,000 tons, but that a Government warehouse with a
capacity of 250,000 tons at Pipri, 20 miles from the port, also can be
used. This is said to be sufficient by one source, but that statement
can be challenged. Many ships carry more than 10,000 tons of fertilizer
and since the Karachi marshalling yard is one of the most important
bottlenecks on the Pakistan rail system, it is unlikely that the rail
wagons are always available at the shipside when needed. Transportation
to Pipri may not always be easy to arrange directly either.
33.       Fertilizer factories have storage space at the plant site
equivalent to between one and six months of production. Available
information is shown in the following table:

1/ Esso claims that storage of bags in the open is no problem. The plant
is located in a desert area with hardly any rain. Losses when bags
are stored in the open are 2-5%.
34.       There are hardly any big fertilizer warehouses in the field.
For field storage both the public and the private sector rent warehouses
with capacities from 250 - 1,000 tons at about 100 key locations. Government
agencies rent several warehouses at each of these locations to serve as
intermediate storage for feeding retail shops. Private dealers have small
multi-purpose godowns with an average capacity of about 25-50 tons.



- 93 -
ANNEX 3-3
Page 20
35.       Storage capacity at the retail level seems inadequate.  The
present glut, the uneven availability of rail wagons or trucks to ship
the fertilizer from the plant site, the fixed retail margin which makes
the dealer unwilling to hold stocks and the expected future requirements
by PR for full trainload shipments to only a few destinations, all these
factors make the present availability of large warehouses, in some cases
at the plant site but particularly in the field, insufficient.
c. Transportation
36.       Unless well planned, major difficulties are foreseen in
transporting the fertilizer from FFC's plant to its market area due to
the close location of the Multan and Mirpur Mathelo plants, all located
within 40 miles along the main raod and railway linking Karachi to
the Punjab.
37.       To avoid any problems, GOP has agreed to set up a Fertilizer Transportation
Task Force, but it has not yet been convened. The Task Force is to include
representatives from GOP, Pakistan Railways, Karachi Port Authority and
the Fertilizer manufacturers. In view of the difficulties experienced in
moving current fertilizer output from plants to markets, it is considered
essential for this Task Force to be established and to develop a master
plan for fertilizer movement as soon as possible, certainly in advance of
the start-up of NFC's Multan plant expansion.

PAKISTAN: FAUJI FERTILIZER PROJECT
FFC'S MARKETING PROGRAM
1.        The organization of the marketing group will follow the structure
originally proposed by Agrico in the "Proposed Marketing Plan" (August 1976).
This plan was jointly developed by Agrico and Fauji Foundation and made available
for the present project. The plan is to be adopted with certain additions and
modifications.
2.        Agricultural extension services to support the FFC marketing efforts
will be furnished in accordance with agreements between the Pakistani and
Scandinavian Governments and agricultural organizations, including Farmer's
Organizations and Cooperatives and in continuance of the collaboration already
existing for years. A detailed program will be set up, to be based inter alia
on reviews of:-
- existing research activities of fertilizer use and associated
problems at university and lower level educational
institutions;
- the activities of existing experimental institutions, in-
cluding experimental farms, and institutions and procedures
for giving individual advice to farmers or farmer groups;
- arrangements for distribution and sale of fertilizers and for
financing of farmer's fertilizer use; and
- fertilizer demand forecasts and updating of such forecasts.
Arrangements will be made to receive a number of university and lower
level trainees in Scandinavian agricultural institutions.
3.        Prior to the FFC plantTs expected start-up in July 1981, it is essential
that the company gradually build up its market with a seeding program. Thus, a
24-month Market Development Program will be carried out over four consecutive
seasons. Sales to dealers are planned to start in late 1979. Before this, the
whole marketing structure will have been established. In addition to urea,
mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP, 11-52-0) is to be imported to meet phosphate
fertilizer demands. The planned seeding program is shown below:

4.        The marketing group will be headed by a Marketing Manager who will
be employed by Topsoe and assigned to FFC's management group. Topsoe has
selected Mr. J. Anthony Ward, who has extensive working experience in the
Pakistan fertilizer market (see also Annex 2-1). Mr. Ward is to be hired in
mid-1978 for an initial 3-year period. He will work with and support from
Scandinavian organizations and companies in the field. During these years,
the marketing group will be staffed and the marketing network gradually
developed.
5.        The Marketing Manager will have at his disposal three main groups:  a
general promotion and advertising group, a distribution and transportation group
and a technical services group. The two first groups are foreseen to be headed
by Pakistanis - possibly with some help from expatriates - whereas the technical
services group should be headed by a Scandinavian or Pakistani. This group will
undertake the following:-
- Agro-services including training of extension personnel. Two
Scandinavians will here be working with a Pakistani staff
growing to about ten.
- Training of FFC staff in general sales and marketing
activities including use of modern computer methods, in
planning and monitoring sales, traffic, warehousing, etc.
Also here expatriate assistance is foreseen. Emphasis is
placed on early development of material for information, pro-
motion and advertising adapted to the level of local agents
and farmers. This material will be used by the main group for
general promotion and advertising.
- Farm demonstration activities. An expatriate will manage the
group, that will otherwise have Pakistani staff growing to
approximately 5 at headquarters and 10-20 travelling. The
group will have at its disposal (fairly simple) mobile
laboratory and similar equipment. It will supervise and
support the farmer service staff working at the premises of
local agents and these shall, although reporting to local
sales agents, coordinate their activities with the Technical
Services Group.
- Setting up of a statistics and sales planning group.
- Provide all necessary help to farmers to get agriculture loans
made available by GOP, ADBP and Commercial Banks.
6.        Expatriate specialists attached to the FFC marketing organization are
expected to be phased out a few years after plant start-up. It is, however,
likely that separate agreements can be made with Scandinavian Governments
allowing for more permanent collaboration of a scientific and practical nature.

ANNEX 3-4

7.        FFC's marketing program is based on the following premises:
- to sell a high quality urea product;
- to organize its sales administration on a regional basis;
- to establish strategic storage capacity;
- to maintain flexibility in transportation;
- to allocate part of sales to commercial customers;
- to reach farmers through an extensive dealer network;
- to promote products through training and advertising
programs.
8.        FFC's Marketing Division headquarters will be in Lahore, the capital
of the Punjab, where the company plans to market 80% of its output, 20% going
to the Sind. In 1982, when the sales volume reaches maturity, seven regional
offices will serve the Punjab and two the Sind. The Marketing Division is built
around the concept of a decentralized organization. Overall policy decisions
and coordination with the plant and between regions will emanate from Marketing
Division headquarters in Lahore but day-to-day operations and implementation of
strategy will be left to the regions. Such an organization will enable the
Marketing Division to meet separate and peculiar needs of each region. The
Division headquarters will provide overall marketing policy, develop sales pro-
grams, long-range planning, advertising and promotional programs. Headquarters
will be responsible for implementing the Marketing and Pricing Principles
Agreement which pertains to marketing with the Central Government and Provincial
Government offices. All product logistics, including control of warehouse levels
and transportation from the plant to marketing regions, will be coordinated in
Lahore. Personnel, technical service and other management functions affecting
more than one marketing region will be administered by the appropriate manager at
the headquarters.
9.        The transportation system, envisaged by FFC for marketing its product,
is divided into two phases: Phase I covers movement from the plant to either
warehouses or dealers; Phase II refers to that product which must then be trans-
shipped from warehouses to dealers. The diagram below illustrates the trans-
portation system:

10.      Although 57% of the product will be shipped from the plant by truck,
that method accounts for only 47% of the total shipping cost of 16.l million
rupees. In Phase I, the product will travel an average distance of 251.22
miles; shipment from the warehouses to dealers in Phase II will average an
additional 25 miles.
11       As a part of its rail transport program, FFC  intends to use rake
trains, each made up of a locomotive and 60-80 wagons. These rakes will travel
to a single destination to be unloaded and then returned to the plant. A rake
train containing approximately 1,400 tons will be dispatched about every other
day to an FFC regional warehouse. An average 655 tons per day will move by
means of rake trains.
12.      An average of about 900 tons of urea will be dispatched daily by truck
from the plant to either warehouses or dealers. Consequently, 90-100 trucks
will be required at the plant on each day.
13.       FFC  will negotiate contracts with two or three truck firms to supply
90-100 trucks per day. With a long-term (2-3 years) contract in hand, truck
contractors will be able to obtain bank financing for the purchase of trucks
employed full-time to move product from the FFC plant to dealers and ware-
houses.
14.      Truckers have recommended that four or five acres at the plant be set
aside for a truck depot. Petroleum companies in Pakistan could bid on the con-
struction of a truck terminal and facilities such as a low-cost restaurant and
covered sleeping area for drivers and helpers. Approximately 200-250 drivers,
helpers and mechanics would be on hand in and around the truck depot in order
to dispatch the 90-100 trucks per day.
15.      Transportation costs are based on 1976 rates.  Rail rates used
are 110% of the rates actually in effect in 1975. The truck rates
are those which were obtained by Esso in 1975 in its 12-month contract with
New Malik Trucking Company. Based on the 1976 rates, total transport cost of
urea will average 68.96 rupees per ton.
16.      MAP will be imported through the port of Karachi and dispatched from
a bulk bagging warehouse in the Karachi area. The total estimated transport
cost of imported MAP is 134.54 rupees per ton, comprised of 121.54 rupees to
ship from Karachi to FFC regional warehouses and 13 rupees to ship from
warehouses to dealers.
17.      FFC has planned for an overall storage capacity of 144,000 tons which
equals about 3 1/2 months' production of which 1 1/2 is at the plant site:
Plant Storage Capacity:
Bulk                       45,000 T
Bagged                     15,000 T
Regional Warehouse:
Bagged                     84,000 T
144,000 T

Page 5
18.       In order to stimulate dealers to warehouse fertilizer products
through off-season periods, FFC will provide a warehousing allowance
during these months. This allowance will cover expenses of warehousing
and interest costs for one to two months. In some instances, FFC
dealers with approved credit may be supplied three or four truckloads of
fertilizer on a delayed billing basis with the payment due after the
start of the next fertilizer season.
19.       Warehouses will be accessible to railways as well as to paved
highways. They will be. so situated as to be able to accommodate rake
trains of 60-80 wagons each plus a locomotive. Rake trains made available
by the Pakistan Railways will be used and will be returned intact to the
plant for reloading for their next destination.
20.       Each region will have a Regional Sales Service Center to provide
service for dealers in the region and to store products during off-seasons.
Storage capacity of the warehouses at Service Centers will range from 6,000
to 20,000 tons each (6,000 square meters to 20,000 square meters each).
Table 37 proposes a plan for regional warehouses to meet projected needs in
1982.
21.       Four to six pickup trucks will be supplied to each center for use
by its managing staff and technical servicemen. Commission Sales Agents who
do not have vehicles of their own will be assisted by the company in
obtaining financing for the purchase of a suitable vehicle.
22.       Deliveries from regional warehouses to dealers will be made by
shorthaul contract truckers, so the region itself will not own any trucks.
23.       Technical Servicemen will be equipped with a pickup truck, a two-
wheel hand tractor and implements for assisting farmers in preparing field
demonstrations. Approximately 60 cars and pickup trucks plus 18 two-wheel
tractors with attachments will be needed in 1980 for the Marketing Division.
24.       Two methods have been suggested for financing the Sales Service
Centers. One has been to capitalize the incurred costs in theFFC capital
budget. The other which is being recommended to FFC management by its
staff is to negotiate with private investors in Pakistan to build the Service
Centers to FFC's specifications and lease the centers back on a long-term
contract, subject to renewal.    FFC staff have discussed the latter means
of financing the sales centers with several entrepreneurs and commercial
banks in Pakistan. Their response to the lease-back approach was favorable.
25.      FFC's marketing program given above is based on studies conducted in
1976. This is presently under review and an updated marketing plan will be
developed in detail by end 1978.

ANNEX 4-1
PAKISTAN: FAUJI FERTILIZER PROJECT
OPERATIONAL MANPOWER NEED AND TRAINING
1.        When in full operation, the project will employ about 660
people (including some 200 contract workers for product handling, load-
ing and general labor) as shown in the accompanying organization chart
(Exhibit 1). About 100 of these will be production and engineering
personnel ranging from senior managers to shift supervisors and chief
operators. A few experienced key people may possibly be recruited from
the other fertilizer producers in Pakistan plus, perhaps, several Paki-
stanis now working overseas. However, the majority of the skilled work
force needed will have to be hired and trained in Pakistan, as it is the
intention of the sponsors and GOP to use Pakistani staff and labor to the
fullest extent and as soon as possible. Accordingly, FFC has entered into
a Technical Services Agreement with Anic SPA of Italy for operating the
FFC plant as well as for selection and training of Pakistani personnel
required to operate and maintain the plant. Anic possess the requisite
technical knowledge and experience of Snam plants and are admirably
suited to undertake the training of key supervisory, operating and
engineering personnel of FFC. This is expected to cost about US dollars
800,000 for training abroad as well as within Pakistan.
Training Program for FFC Technical Personnel (Outside Pakistan)
2.        On the basis of their experience, Anic estimate that about 460
manmonths of training abroad will be required for FFC technical personnel.
This training would take place either at Anic's plants or at similar plants
belonging to Third Parties.
3.        The training program, including the training period at the plants
and the number of trainees for each cycle, shall be established by Anic
according to the availability of instructors and plant facilities.
4.        The operating personnel, during practical training at plants,
shall be present at shut-downs, start-ups and various operations; yield
checks and optimization calculations will also be provided for Develop-
ment Managers; laboratory analysts will have practice in sample drawings
and analyses.
5.        If feasible, the maintenance personnel will also spend a train-
ing period at Suppliers' Workshops, each according to his own specialty,
i.e. compressor and turbine operators at NUOVO PIGNONE if this Company is
the supplier of said machines; instrument fitters at the workshops of the
Instrumentation Suppliers; electricians at the electrical equipment
suppliers, etc.
6.        Anic will ask Snamprogetti to include training of Pakistani
personnel at the Suppliers' workshops when the various orders are issued.

ANNEX 4-1
Page 2
7.        The maintenance Personnel will also attend machine dismantling
and assembly, inspections and tests on operating machines and equipment
as well as various maintenance operations at Anic workshops.
8.        The theoretical courses will be held by Anic's instructors with
an average of one teacher per 15 trainees.
The training program summary shows the qualifications (60 persons)
envisaged by Anic and the total training periods.
Training Program for FFC Personnel in Pakistan
9.        This training will be carried out with the assistance of Anic's
personnel during plant operation and maintenance and is estimated to
require about 285 manmonths.
10.       For personnel not trained abroad, Anic proposes special training
consisting of theoretical courses held by Anic's teaching personnel and
practical courses at Pak-Saudi Urea plant now under construction at
Mirpur Mathelo as well as at Goth Machhi FFC Plant during erection (for
maintenance personnel) and start-up.
11.       The training program summary shows the qualifications envisaged
by Anic and the total training periods.
Personnel Training at Suppliers' Workshops
12.       As requested by the Bank, further training opportunities will be
provided for key Pakistani project and operating personnel by arrang-
ing for them to work in the office of Snam during the engineering and
procurement phases of the project. Selected groups of Pakistani engineers
and others will work side by side with their foreign counterparts and will
also be given appropriate experience in the workshops and offices of the
major equipment vendors (especially makers of rotary machines). Most
importantly, during the final stages of plant construction and subsequent
commissioning, Pakistani administrative, supervisory and operating man-
power will work closely with experienced field crews from the contractors,
vendors and key expatriate operating personnel and put into practice their
previously acquired learning. This supplemental experience plus the formal
training program organized by Anic should provide FFC with a proficient,
safety-conscious and reliable plant operating staff.
13.       Training of senior designated Pakistani executives in project
and operations administration, market research and marketing will also be
undertaken on a side-by-side basis in conjunction with experienced ex-
patriate personnel according to the corporate management structures shown
in Annex 2-2 and Annex 4-6 and as part of the Technical Assistance and
Know-How Agreement between Fauji and Topsoe and Anic.

ANNEX 4-2
PAKISTAN: FAUJI FERTILIZER PROJECT
PROJECT EXECUTION ORGANIZATION
1.        Topsoe will have responsibility for project execution as shown
in the project organization structure (Exhibit 1). Mr. I. C. Carstensen,
a senior Topsoe project executive, has been appointed Project Manager.
He will report to the Managing Director of FFC and will liaise with the
Project Officer in Denmark (see also Annex 2-1). Exhibit 2 illustrates
the basic organization structure for Project Engineering and Exhibit 3
shows the organization of the project senior job-site staff. As
mentioned, most senior project personnel will initially be Topsoe staff
members, but as the project proceeds, increasing responsibility will be
given to counterpart Pakistanis, after training and demonstrated competence.
2.        FFC have engaged the services of an independent engineering
consultant, James Chemical Engineering of New York (JCE),to advise the
Managing Director FFC on the design, engineering procurement, and
commissioning of the plant.
3.        Anic S.p.A. of Italy have been selected to provide expert
technical services to FFC for operation and maintenance of the plant.
During the construction period Anic will assist FFC in checking the design
and layout of the plant. Anic will also train FFC's technical personnel
for the operation and maintenance of the plant.
4.        FFC has selected Snamprogetti, S.p.A. of Italy to design and
engineer the plant and Coming S.p.A. (a wholly owned subsidiary of
Snam) to erect and commission the ammonia and urea plants. Snam will
also assist FFC with procurement. Snam will act as prime engineering firm
and coordinate the erection and commissioning of the entire plant, under-
taking responsibility for offsites, design and procurement, plus project
time and cost control. Snam's selection was accepted by IBRD, USAID and
KfW.
5.        The contract between FFC and the engineering firms is based
on lump-sum fee for engineering and design of the plant and procurement
services, plus a reimbursable fee for supervision of plant construction and
erection. The contract also includes a 28 months mechanical completion
time, a ceiling price for plant and equipment in addition to a Guaranteed
Maximum Selling Price (GMSP) for design, procurement services, supply
construction and erection of the plant. Snam has given a Ceiling Price,
for all plant and equipment, above which the overruns will be 100%
Snam's liability. As an incentive to minimize project cost the construction
firm (Coming) is to pay a penalty equal to 10% of the difference between
the actual cost and the GMSP, subject to a limit of US$1,000,000. This
amount represents about 20% of a typical contractor's profit on a project
of this type and magnitude and is considered an adequate incentive.

ANNEX 4-2
Page 2
6.        Under the Know-How Agreement, Topsoe will make available to FFC,
for a royalty of US$1 million (to be reduced by any reimbursement made by FFC
for actual pre-project expenses), payable in the first and second year of opera-
tion, its current and future proprietary and technical information relating
to the engineering, design, equipment, procurement and operation of plants
similar to the project, including advice relating to the technical, legal,
financial, administrative, managerial and marketing supervision during
all stages of implementation of the project up to commencement of commercial
operation. Topsoe and Anic will continue to provide operating, management,
control and technical services know-how as it relates to production,
debottlenecking and expansion for a fee of US$1 per ton of product sold
for a period of ten years. In addition, Topsoe and Anic will be re-
imbursed up to US$3 million for expenses incurred with pre-start-up and
post start-up assistance, marketing, training and overhead as detailed
in Annex 4-3.
Responsibility and Authority
7.        The following will in summary be the arrangements concerning
responsibility and authority:
-  The FFC Board will have ultimate responsibility for the
Project.
-  The Board will delegate authority to make main decision
to the Managing Director.
-  Responsibility and authority for project execution will
be further delegated to the Project Manager. His
authority, however, will be limited as follows:
- Where approved contracts exist, to follow these
- and where approved contracts do not exist, to make
decisions with financial consequences limited to
agreed amounts.
-  Authority for plant operation will be delegated to the
Operating Company, Anic.
-  Project Execution by the General Contractor will be
followed by a technical Independent Consultant who will
advise the Managing Director and Project Management and
report in parallel to Project Management, Managing
Director, and lenders.

ANNEX 4-5
PAKISTAN: FAUJI FERTILIZER PROJECT
PROCESS DESCRIPTION
Ammonia Production
1.        Synthesis gas for ammonia production is produced from natural gas
in a series of steps beginning with a primary reforming with steam. Here,
desulfurized gas is combined with superheated steam in an amount
approximately equal to a 3 to 1 steam/carbon ratio. The combined stream
at a pressure of approximately 500-550 psig is then preheated to about
950 degrees F and passed through catalyst-filled 25/20 chromenickel alloy
tubes suspended in the radiant section of the reformer. In passing
through the tubes, the hydrocarbon components, mostly methane, are partly
converted to carbon oxides and hydrogen and exit at a temperature
normally in excess of 1,500 degrees F. The partially reformed gas then
flows to a secondary reformer where it is mixed with preheated air in a
quantity necessary to reform the unconverted hydrocarbons and at the
same time provide the required amount of nitrogen for ammonia synthesis.
Air required for the secondary reforming step is supplied from a
centrifugal steam-turbine-driven compressor.
2.        Reformed gas from the secondary reformer now containing less
than about 0.4% methane is cooled in waste heat boilers down to about
700 degrees F prior to introduction to the high temperature shift
converter where part of the carbon monoxide content of the gas is
converted to carbon dioxide by reaction with steam, with an equivalent
production of hydrogen. To complete this conversion of carbon monoxide,
the gas after cooling flows into a second stage low temperature shift
converter where the carbon monoxide content of the gas is reduced to
less than 0.5 percent.
3.        The raw synthesis gas now contains essentially hydrogen,
nitrogen, carbon dioxide and small amounts of hydrocarbons and carbon
monoxide and goes through a series of purification steps to provide an
ammonia synthesis gas with a hydrogen to nitrogen ratio of 3 to 1. In the
first step, carbon dioxide is removed from the gas by scrubbing with
activated potassium carbonate solution. Then, the remaining carbon
oxides are removed by conversion to methane by reaction with hydrogen in
the presence of a nickel base catalyst. The final synthesis gas then
contains in addition to nitrogen and hydrogen, less than about 10 ppm
of carbon oxides, the maximum which can be tolerated by the ammonia
synthesis catalyst, and small amounts of methane which are harmless and
are continually purged from the ammonia synthesis system.
4.        The carbon dioxide absorbed by the potassium carbonate solution
is removed from the solution by heating the rich absorbent in a stripping
tower. The recovered carbon dioxide is subsequently reacted with ammonia
to form urea. The composition of Mari gas is such that the quantity of



- 114 -
ANNEX 4-5
Page 2
carbon dioxide produced in the gas reforming process described is
sufficient to enable all the ammonia produced to be converted to urea.
5.        In the synthesis of ammonia the nitrogen-hydrogen mixture is
compressed to a pressure of about 3,650 psig by a steam turbine driven
centrifugal compressor. Recycle gas plus make up gas after cooling and
removal of liquid ammonia are compressed in a separate case to some
3,850 psig. Then the gas which now contains only about 3.6 percent
ammonia is reheated by heat exchange and passed to the ammonia converter.
This vessel is of special radial design and contains an activated iron-
base catalyst to promote the synthesis reaction and special provision
for control of the reaction heat developed so as to maintain optimum
reaction temperature. The converter effluent gas is cooled from the
reaction temperature of about 900 degrees F by preheating boiler feed
water and heat exchange with incoming converter feed gas before cooling
with cooling water, heat exchange and refrigeration subsequent mixing
with make-up gas as described above.
6.        Liquid ammonia produced in the process is transferred directly
to the urea unit for production of urea, or to storage.
Urea Production
7.        In the production of urea, ammonia and carbon dioxide are re-
acted at a pressure of about 2,150 psig and at a temperature of about 360
degrees F to produce ammonium carbamate, an intermediate product which is
subsequently dehydrated to form urea. An excess of ammonia is used for
the reaction and the dehydration reaction does not proceed to completion.
Therefore, the reaction products are urea, ammonium carbamate, free
ammonia and water formed during dehydration reaction. The reaction
products flow from the urea reactor to the urea stripper operating at the
same pressure and externally heated where the excess ammonia acts as
stripping agent to concentrate the urea solution. The stripped carbamate
vapour are condensed and recycled to the reactor. The products flow
from the stripper to the first and second stage decomposers where the
pressure is reduced and heat is applied to convert the ammonium carbamate
back to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The ammonia and carbon dioxide
are then condensed and recycled back to the synthesis loops as carbonate
solution. The excess ammonia is condensed and returned to the reactor
with fresh ammonia feed. The final urea solution is concentrated by
evaporation of the water under vacuum and sent to a prilling bucket inside
a tall tower to form solid beads or "prills." The prills are collected
on a belt conveyor system at the bottom of the tower from where the urea
product leaving the tower is transported to the bulk storage building or
to the bagging station.

PAKISTAN: FAUJI FERTILIZER PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
1. Commissioning date: July 1, 1981
2. Capacity utilization: 1981/2A: 65%; 1982/3: 85%; 1983/4 and
thereafter: 90% (at 330 stream days per
year)
3. Revenues and costs are in current terms up to 1981, and in 1982
terms thereafter.
4. Pricing of urea (see para. 6.02)
The ex-factory price of urea is set, for a period of 10 years fol-
lowing the commencement of operations, so as to yield an annual 16%
after-tax return on initial preferred share capital and an annual
20% after-tax return on initial common share capital. The 16%
return on preferred stock is cumulative (i.e., if not paid in one
particular year, it is carried forward for payment in the following
years). The 20% return on common stock is based on 65% capacity
utilization (at 315 stream days per year) in the first year of
operation (12 months), 85% in the second year, and 90% from the
third year onwards. The 20% return will be realized only if the
Company sells the urea produced at the annual levels stipulated
above, and therefore the actual return will be lower/higher should
the sales be lower/higher than the annual production level stipulated.
5. Manufacturing costs at full (90')capacity: See Annex 6-2.
6. Marketing Department: See Annex 3-4.
7. Know-How Fees: US$0.5 million to Fauji and $1.0 million to Topsoe,
payable in the first and second years of operation,
and US$1.0 per ton of urea produced and sold for the
first ten years of operation, split between Topsoe and Anic.
8. Fixed and variable manufacturing cost:
Natural Gas                      85% variable, 15% fixed
Catalysts and Chemicals         100% variable
Raw Water                        85% variable, 15% fixed
Bags                            100% variable
Operating Supplies              100% variable
Royalty                         100% variable
Labor                            85% fixed, 15% variable
Maintenance Supplies             85% fixed, 15% variable
Insurance                       100% fixed
General & Administration        100% fixed
*Fiscal years ending June 30.

9. Depreciation and amortization, straight-line over 10 years. Residual
value of the plant after 10 years is 10% of original investment.
10. Terms of Loans and Credits
- maturity: 15 years including 4 years of grace
- repayment: in equal semi-annual installments
- interest cost: foreign: 10%
local:    14%
11. Contributions to Workers Participation Fund: 7% of pre-tax income.
12. Taxes: the corporate income tax rate is 55% of pre-tax income (less
workers' participation fund); losses can be carried forward
for five years for tax purposes.
13.  One-half the dividend on common stock is paid during the year in which
it is earned and the remaining half during the following year.
14. 1978 prices are arrived at by using a discounting factor of 6% per annum
between 1978 and 1982.

into account capital cost increases up to US$272 million, i.e.
+ 5% from the US$260 million basis. Any further increase in
capital costs will not lead to an upward adjustment in the price
of urea.
2/ According to the pricing formula, the price of urea the third year
onwards is based on a capacity utilization of 90% (at 315 days
per year). A higher (resp. lower) capacity utilization will be
to the advantage (resp. detriment) of FFC. This report uses a
basis of 330 stream days.

ANNEX 7-1
PAKISTAN: FAUJI FERTILIZER PROJECT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Raw Material Prices
1.        The Project will be based on the Mari gas field which has a
relatively high carbon dioxide content and low heating value (700 BTU per
SCF compared to a standard of about 950 BTU per SCF for gas used for
heating purposes) which makes it unsuitable for long-range transmission and
use for energy purposes unless it is first purified at appreciable cost. It
is ideal, however, for producing urea which is made by combining ammonia
and carbon dioxide. The price of gas to FFC would be US$0.28 per MSCF at
wellhead. The opportunity cost of gas is taken at US$0.94 per MSCF
at wellhead, which is equivalent to US$1.29 per MSCF for 700
BTU per SCF gas at consuming centers. On an energy equivalent
basis, the latter figure corresponds to a c.i.f. fuel oil price of
US$70 per ton (in 1978 terms).
Treatment of Foreign Exchange Required by the Project
2.        The foreign exchange required by the Project is treated in two
ways,depending on whether it is available to Pakistan irrespective of
whether the Project was carried out or not.
3.        Topsoe's, IFU's and IDB's equity is clearly tied to the Project.
It would not have been available to the country in the absence of the
Project and does not materially affect the availability of other foreign
exchange to the economy. Accordingly, the use of this share capital does
not involve any cost to Pakistan. However, the repatriation of royalties,
dividends and equity involve a cost to Pakistan at the time these payments
are made since in the absence of the Project these payments would not
have occurred.
4.        By contrast, it is assumed that foreign credits and loans from IDA, USAID,
KfW, Italy and Denmark would, by and large, have been available to the
economy in the absence of this Project. Accordingly, the use of these
loans is imputed at cost. The repayment of the loans is not made (at
more or less the same terms) in the absence of the Project. Accordingly,
the opportunity cost of the untied foreign exchange cost is obtained by
subtracting the above equity contributions from the capital cost stream
used in financial analysis (after adjusting for taxes and import duties).
No shadow pricing is used for the local currency. All the construction
labor is assumed to be skilled labor, and,hence, the actual wages are
used as opportunity cost of labor.

1/  All figures in the first four columns are in current terms up to 1982 and
1982 terms thereafter.
2/ The Economic Cost in 1978 terms is obtained by discounting the fourth
column.  The inflation rate is assumed at 6% per year.
3/  Working capital plus residual value of equipment (10% of original
plant investment).
Economic Rate of Return
5.        The economic analysis is carried out in real terms using 1978
prices as base. Foreign exchange in the hands of the Government is used
as numeraire. Except for gas and urea prices, the opportunity cost of
the Project's inputs and outputs is based on financial costs adjusted for
taxes. No shadow pricing is used for local currency labor cost.
6.        The economic benefits of the Project are derived from import
substitution. The opportunity cost of urea is taken as the foreign
exchange saved. The economic price for bagged urea is assumed to be
increasing from US$189 per ton in 1982 to US$230 in 1985 and thereafter.
The resulting cost and benefit stream are shown in Table 2.

Economic Rate of Return:  22.7%.
1/  Payments consist of (1) Topsoe's royalty of a total US$1.0
million to be paid during the two initial years of operation,
plus a fee of US$1 per ton of urea produced (including US$.50
to Anic during the three initial years of operation), (2)
dividends to foreign shareholders (Topsoe, IFU, IDB) and (3)
repatriation of foreign equity.
2/  The operating cost does not include royalty payment, but includes
payments to workers' participation fund, considered as transfer
payments.
7.        Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effect of
changes in fertilizer prices, delay in construction and lower capacity
utilization on the economic rate of return. Three prices of urea were
used, US$220, US$23Q and US$250 per ton of urea; the corresponding f.o.b.
prices of exports are US$35 per ton lower. The assumptions made are:
(i) 10% cost overrun, (ii) a delay of six months in project construction
and (iii) lower capacity utilization (50% during the first year, 65%
during the second, 85% during the third, 90% from the fourth year on-

wards). The result of the sensitivity analysis is shown in Table 3.
As would be expected in capital intensive projects, the rate of return is
sensitive to changes in the above variables. But even under the unlikely
combination of the most adverse circumstances, the economic rate of
return remains satisfactory.
