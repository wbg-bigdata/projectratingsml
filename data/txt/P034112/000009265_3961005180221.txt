MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMN)ATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IPTRNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
ACTING AS TRUSTE FOR THE TRUST FUND FOR GAZA
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$30 MILLION
FOR AN EMERGENCY REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recomnmendation on a proposed credit
to the Occupied Territories (OT) in the amount of US$30 million equivalent to help finance an Emergency
Rehabilitation Project (ERP). The proposed credit would be on IDA terms, with 40 years maturity,
including 10 years grace. Cofinancing is expected from at least 5 donors.
2.    Bacground. The historic September 13, 1993 Agreement between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO), the Declaration of Principles (DOP), and the prospect of significant
development assistance from the international community provide a window of opportunity for addressing
some of the most critical social and economic needs of the Palestinian population. They also provide an
opportunity for laying a foundation for addressing the many structural ills of the economy. Under DOP,
it is planned that Palestinian authorities will assume control of internal affairs in Gaza and Jericho; in the
West Bank they will have significantly increased responsibilities. In preparation for exercising these new
responsibilides, the PLO and its policy-making arm, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), have been
elaborating plans to rehabilitate the economy. Also, on October 31, 1993, they established the Palestinian
Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR) as the main vehicle for economic
policy making, programming, management, administration and aid coordination during the period of
transition, a period of uncertain duration.
3.    The economy of the OT is under severe strain, and in almost every respect conditions in Gaza are
far worse than in the West Bank. Incomes have stagnated; unemployment and underemployment levels
have risen rapidly; public infrastructure and social services are grossly overstretched and often uneconomi-
cally provided; many local institutions are weak and in financial crisis; and the fragile natural resource
base is threatened with irreversible damage. Between 1968 and 1980, the economy grew rapidly.
However, growth started slowing down with the end of the regional boom in the early 1980s, and since
the beginning of the Inufada in 1987 decline has set in. Per capita GDP did not grow in Gaza, and grew
at an average annual rate of 3 percent in the West Bank. On average, disposable income grew even less:
on a per capita basis, incomes rose by about 2.5 percent a year in the West Bank and declined by over
2 percent a year in Gaza. In 1993 incomes fell to their pre-Intifada levels. This has had a considerable
hnpact on :-ving standards. Recent estimates indicate that about 17 percent of the population of the West
Bank and 33 percent of that of Gaza now live in poverty.
4.    Economic and political dislocation, the concomitant underinvestment in the public sector, and the
absence of appropriate and effective institutions have all contributed significantly to the present grossly
inadequate level of infrastructure and services provision. Currently, these are far below the levels in
countries with comparable per capita GNP (OT:US$1,715 in 1991). For example, average urban water
supply is only about 60 liters per capita per day (compared to 115 in Tunisia and 137 in Jordan), and few
municipalities have adequate wastewater collection, treatment or disposal systems. Electricity consumption
(680 kWh per capita per year) is low compared to Egypt and Jordan; street lighting is almost non-existent;
and some 138 villages have no services or are dependent on isolated diesel-generated supplies. The road
network, while typical of countries at similar income levels, has deteriorated to the point where, without
immediate rehabilitation, past investments may be completely lost; and solid waste collection and disposal



2
are poorly organized, raising serious health and environmental concerns. The above economic, political
and institutional factors have also contributed to inadequacies in the provision of social services. In most
parts of the OT educational facilities are in poor condition, and breakdowns in discipline and low student
achievements are common. In the case of health services, the inappropriate policies and operational
inefficiencies have contributed to waste and less-than-expected benefits from the resources allocated to the
sector.
5.    In sum, the problems are deep, multiple and mutually reinforcing, leading to a sense of
hopc:essness and despair among large segments of the population. These deeply embedded problems can
only be solved if they are addressed urgently, together, and in a coordinated way. Also, the prospects for
lasting peace and sustainable development in the region wil! depend upon their early resolution. This will
require resource inflows that will enable sustainable economic activity to improve the living conditions of
all Palestinians, particularly those of the poor. Providing productive employment for the Palestinians
within the OT will be amnong the most challenging issues in the coming years, and stimulating growth in
the productive sectors and services will be essential for facing this challenge. Moreover, significant
improvements in basic infrastructural facilities and services are needed to improve living conditions, to
support private sector activities and to avoid further environmental degradation.
6.    To help mobilize international support for the OT, a donors conference was held in Washington,
D.C. on October 1, 1993. Participants in the conference felt strongly that unless the Agreement was
followed by signs of rapid economic and social imnprovement for broad segments of the Palestinian
population, political support for the Agreement may wither, undermining the entire peace process and with
incalculable consequences. In order to provide effective support to the OT, donors: a) pledged over US$2
billion in financial assistance; b) established an Ad Hoc Liaison Commnittee (AHLC) to help coordinate
doncr assistance, with the Bank as secretariat: c) established a US$35 million Technical Assistance Trust
Fund (TAF) to help finance studies for program and project preparation and institution building, and to
be managel by the Bank; and d) requested the Bank to provide a programmatic framnework for effective
use of the planned assistance.
7.    IDA Asssanc Strate. IDA has been in the forefront of efforts to help Palestinian authorities
define a feasible rehabilitation and development strategy, and its six-volume study, prepared jointly with
Palestinian counterparts during 1993 and entitled Developing The Occupied Territories: An Investment
In Peace, September 1993 (the Study), provided the technical and policy underpinnings for the delibera-
tions of the October 1993 Donors conference. Also, in September 1993 the Bank decided to set aside US$
50 million from its profits into a special trust fund (the Trust Fund for Gaza) to help finance priority
rehabilitation projects in Gaza. Further, responding to the urgency expressed by all parties, IDA missions
were dispatched to the OT during October 11 to November 22, 1993 and again during December 6 to 14,
1993, to prepare an Emergency Assistance Program (EAP, or 'the Program'). a supporting Technical
Assistance Program (TAP), and a complementary Emergency Rchabilitation Project (ERP). The EAP,
TAP and an outline of ERP were presented at a Consultative Group (CG) meeting held in Paris on
December 16, 1993. These were discussed and agreed by donors, and pledges of financial support were
obtained. At the December 1993 meeting, IDA and donors agreed on the need to establish a mcchanism
to help finance start-up costs, and in January 1994 it was decided to establish the Johan )orgen Holst Peace
Trust Fund for this purpose. This fund will also be managed by the Bank.
8.    Underlying the Bank's efforts is a strategy which seeks to achieve a delicate balance between the
provision of relief, the rebuilding of critical infrastructure and institutions, and laying the foundation for
long-term sustainable growth. The EAP, this proposed ERP (which is part of EAP) and TAP. complement
each other and together embody this strategy. All were developed in close comsultation with Palestinian
counterparts, and reflect ajointly agreed approach. Also, within each of the main subsectors tackled under



3
EAP both short (1-3 years) and long (3-7 years) term strategies were jointly developed with Palestinian
counterparts. Since EAP and TAP are presented in separate, companion documents-respectively, the
Emergency Assistance Program For The Occupied Territories, and the Technical Asance Program
For The Occupied Territories, both dated December 1993-they are only briefly summarized below.
(Further details on EAP and TAP are presented in the appendices of the Technical Annex and in the
Project file.)
9.   The Emergency Assistance Program (EAP). The Program comprises a three-year set of priority
investments in both Gaza and the West Bank. It includes ERP and other donor-assisted projects and
programs, and would provide support for: (a) public investments in ten sectors; (b) private sector
investments; and (c) start-up expenditures for the central administration, municipalities and existing NGOs.
The public infrastrctu  investment component focusses on quicldy removing the most critical
developmental bottlenecks and creating productive employment through the rehabilitation, reconstruction
and improvement of basic infrastructure in ten sectors: education; health and welfare; power; telecoms;
water, wastewater and sanitation; solid waste; inter-urban roads and transport; municipal roads and
facilities (markets, abattoirs, etc.); housing; and agricultture. The housing sub-component focusses on
limited and selective rehabilitation of the refugee camnps; construction of middle and moderate income
housing on a commercial basis; and development of private sector financing mechanisms. The pdvate
sector investment component focusses on creating an enabling environment for private investment through
supporting the development of the financial system, including the strengthening of credit institutions. This
also includes supporting the establishment of apex bank facilities to channel long-term funds to local credit
institutions for onlending on a commercial basis to support private business activity in key sectors of the
economy (agriculture, industry, tourism and housing). The start-up exp_et    support component
would provide temporary assistance to four main activities: (i) strengthening the implementation capacity
of municipalities and villages; (ii) providing support to the central governmental institutions to strengthen
administration and finance essential employment and relief; (iii) providing incremental operating support
for UNRWA's planned activities (within its mandate); and (iv) providing incremental operating support
for the similarly planned activities of the NGOs.
10.   The Program is estimated to cost a total of about US$1.2 billion, and would be implemented over
a three-year period. The expenditure requirements in the first year are estimated at US$0.4 billion, and
commitments and pledges to date amount to US$0.6 billion, including proposed credits of US$50 million.
PECDAR would have the overall responsibility for program management, aid coordination, monitoring
and reporting. (PECDAR's role and structure are described in the Technical Annex.) To the extent
possible, the program would be implemented through the following existing institutions: (a) municipalities
(water and sanitation, municipal roads and facili:ies, and solid waste components); (b) UNRWA
(education, welfare, physical infrastructure and housing components within the refugee camps); (c) UNDP
(water and sanitation components, mainly technical assistance and support); and (d) NGOs (higher
education, health, welfare, women, children's and rural infrastructure components).
11.   The Technical Assstance Program (TAP). The TAP would help to prepare and support
implementation of investment activities; provide support for the development of much of the policy
framework required to ensure the sustainability of the investment program; and lay the institutional basis
for interim self-government. The TAP activities include: (a) immediate assistance to ensure effective
implementation of the Emergency Assistance Program, including the Emergency Rehabilitation Project to
be financed by IDA and donors; (b) training and institutional development to enhance Palestinian capacity
for planning, coordination and implementation of development policies, programs and projects over the
medium term, including studies which will assist the Palestinians to prepare for the transfer of authority



4
in designated areas; (c) policy studies and technical analysis for priority macro and sectoral issues
confronting the OT; and (d) feasibility studies, including environmental reviews, and preparation work
for priority investments likely to be taken up during the next 3-5 years.
12.   Emergency Rehabilitation Project (ERP) (Ojectives and Strategy. The proposed ERP is a core
component of the Bank's assistance strategy for the OT. Its main objective is to help alleviate the current
crisis by delivering widespread and tangible benefits to broad sections of the Palestinian populaWon as
qckly, equitably and effectively as possible.  T7hs would be done by removing the most critical
ifrastructural bottlenecks, improing essential facilities services, and creating productve employment.
In order to maximize its impact and carefully husband its resources under ERP, IDA ir, coordination with
donors would focus on a limited number of sectors where: (a) needs are greatest: (b) employment and
other widespread benefits can be quicldy generated; (c) subprojects are ready for implementation or can
be quickly prepared; (d) policy and .environmental issues are not contentious; and (e) donors are not very
active or there is an urgent need to provide policy leadership and guidance. Singly and/or in combination,
these criteria eliminated health and welfare, solid waste, housing, and telecom components from
consideration for inclusion in ERP. In these sectors donors, UN agencies and NGOs are already very
active, and it is anticipated that telecoms and agriculture would be taken up by the private sector. The
remaining sectors are included in ERP, and are the ones in which IDA's technical, policy and supervisory
skills and capacities can be most effectively employed in support of EAP's objectives.
13.   Project Description. The proposed Trust Fund credit would help finance: (a) the rehabilitation,
reconstruction and/or improvement of priority infrastructural services in four sectors (i) education; (ii)
power, (iii) water, wastewater and sanitation; and (iv) roads; and (b) institutional support, capacity building
an  project management to effectively implement both the project and EAP. The
rehabilitaion component (US$119.7 million, 94 percent of the project cost) would include: improvements
to structures (including school buildings and road and drainage structures), networks, systems, plant and
facilities; provision of essential vehicles, equipment and supplies (including laboratory equipment and text
books), and spares; and technical assistance for project preparation and implementation. The insttutional
support component (US$8.3 million, 6 percent of the project cost) would include support for identifiable
priority expenditures of central levels of government for: the establishment and operating costs of
PECDAR; incremental operating costs associated with the implementation of the project (project/contract
review, evaluation, monitoring, accounting, auditing, reporting); essential vehicles, equipment supplies,
and spares; and such other activities and expenditures as IDA and PECDAR ma.. from time to time
mutually agree are essential for the effective execution of the proj.ct.
14.   Project Cost and Financing Plan. The total cost of ERP is estimated at US$128 million including
physical contingencies (10 percent of base cost), and price contingencies (11 percent of base cost). In
accordance with the September 1993 Board decision (para. 7), the Trust Fund credit of US$30 million (23
percet of project costs) would finance components in Gaza only. Financing would be on IDA terms.
The balance of the Trust Fund (US$20 million) would be used to finance a second project to be agreed
with PECDAR. Donor cofinancing of US$18 million on a joint basis, and US$80 million on a parallel
basis would support components in both Gaza and the West Bank (see Schedule A). A portion of the
cofinancing for the project is tied. According to IDA operational procedures (OD 11.00), IDA cannot
manage or supervise procurement on partially or wholly tied funds from bilateral donors without the
specific approval of the Executive Directors. Given the practical difficulties at the present time for some
donors to undertake by themselves the administration of their contributions to the project, to relieve the
administrave burden on PECDAR during the start-up period, and to ensure effective coordination by IDA
in its financing the program of assistance, we seek approval: (a) to administer a Danish grant (in the
amount of US$20 million), even though one-half of the grant would be reserved for procurement of Danish
goods and services; and (b) to administer a Saudi Fund grant in all of its aspects, save for decisions with



respect to procurement which will be made by the Saudi Fund according to its eligibility requirements.
Similar considerations and actions would apply in respect of some other cofinancing (Kuwait Fund and
United Arab Emirates, see para. 20 of the Technical Annex), for which approval is also sought. The
amounts and methods of procurement and a disbursement breakdown are shown in Schedule B. Selection
of subprojects for Danish and Saudi Fund financing has been on the basis of economy and efficiency. The
Trust Fund credit (and donor funds) would finance 100 percent of local and foreign expenditures because
PECDAR is not in a position to provide project funding. This is an exceptional situation and not expected
to apply to future projects. A timetable of key project processing events is provided in Schedule C. Since
there has been no previous IDA or Bank group lending to the OT, Schedule D has been omitted. A map
is also attached.
15.   Project Implementaton. The project would be implemented over a three-year period beginning
July 1, 1994, and draw upon the capacity being established in PECDAR for overall program management.
Responsibility for policy guidance would lie with PECDAR's Board of Governors. However, responsibi-
lity for overall infrastructure investment program management, project implementation, monitoring and
reporting would lie with the management of PECDAR, primarily with the Director of the Program
Management and Monitoring Office (PMO). This responsibility would be exercised within a framework
established by, and in consultation with the Economic Policy Office of PECDAR. In order to ensure that
PECDAR can mobilize quickly and yet remain a lean organization capable of responding effectively to
changing circumstances, PMO would rely on the services of competent managing and procurement
consultants (MC). This would be a firm recruited internationally on terms and conditions consistent with
IDA procurement guidelines. Appointment of these consultants by PECDAR would be a condition of
effectiveness of the Trust Fund credit. PMO would also employ sector implementation consultants (SIC)
to help prepare and supervise the implementation of the power and inter-urban roads components. In order
to avoid the danger of over-centralization and ensure that local needs and priorities are effectively attended
to, while the PMO (and PECDAR) would have its headquarters in the West Bank it would establish a sub-
office in Ga  (the Gaza office). Further, to the extent possible, PMO would rely on existing institutions
and agencies-mainly the municipalities-to execute subprojects; and in order to expedite project
implementation, municipalities would be provided with technical support and given considerable autonomy
in contrActing for works costing US$0.25 million or less. This limit would be reviewed periodically by
PECDAR and adjusted upwards as municipalities demonstrated effective managerial capacity.
16.   The project would be implemented under highly unusual, difficult and risky circumstances and has
been designed with this fact in mind. The political and economic situation is in flux, institutions are weak,
the number and range of potential subprojects is great, and the quality and level of preparation is variable.
Thus, a high degree of fleibility has been bilt into project design. Accordingly, no attempt was made
to elaborate every component in detail. Instead, a strategy was adopted to identify and appraise a core,
first-year set of priority subprojects, while pudting in place institutional capacity, selection processes and
a set of selection criteria which would ensure effective subproject identification, preparation and
implementation for the remaining years. These processes and criteria would also help ensure objectivity
and transparency. Reinforcing these arrangements would be technical assistance in the form of competent
managing and procurement consultants (para. 15). Underpinning these arrangements would be intensive
IDA support during the first year and one-half. This would include stationing IDA advisory and
supervisory staff in Jerusalem for at least the first six months of the project. Implementation and
supervisory arrangements would be reviewed continuously during the life of the project and, where
necessary, changes made (including the reallocation of funds between sectors and revisions of institutional
arrangements) by mutual agreement to achieve project objectives. Such reviews would be a core part of
proposed fonnal half-yearly consultations between IDA and PECDAR.



6
17.   Project Sustainabiity.  While the focus of the ERP would be on rehabilitation, project
components have been selected with a view to sustainability. A key step in project design was the joint
development with Palestinian counterparts of a short and medium term strategic framework (see Technical
Annex, Appendix 3), and the utilization of this framework for subproject identification. Also, the project
selection criteria (para. 16) include consideration of recurrent cost implications and would help to rule out
subprojects involving significant and unsustainable future recurrent costs. In addition, to the extent
possible re'iance would be placed on local capacity and existing institutions, and technical assistance would
be provided under the project and through the TAP to strengthen the capacity of these institutions, further
aiding sustainability. Finally, in designing the project all feasible steps were taken to ensure local
ownership--a critical aspect of sustainability.
18.   Lessons from previous Bank/IDA Involvement. Since 1967, there has been no Bank or IDA
involvement in the OT. However, the Bank and IDA have together financed some 130 emergency projects
worldwide The key "success" lessons are the following: (a) clarity of project objectives--avoid confusing
emergency objectives with longer term policy reform objectives; (b) project simplicity; (c) use of existing
organizations and procedures to the maximum extent possible; and (d) local ownership. These lessons
have all been incorporated into the design of ERP. For example, out of a potential ten, the number of
sectors have been limited to four; subproject selection criteria have been established which focus on short.-
term rehabilitation objectives, readiness, and ownership; existing municipalities and municipal procedures
would be relied upon to the maximum extent possible and strengthened where necessary; and every aspect
of the project has been developed in close consultation with Palestinian counterparts and reflects their
priorities. However, the situation in the OT cannot be considered a "normal" emergency. Higher-level
political and administrative institutions which can be taken for granted in a "normal" state do not exist and
have to be created as part of the institutional support and capacity-building process. This fact alone means
that while the lessons from previous projects should be (and are being) observed, they cannot be followed
blindly.
19.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. There is a consensus within the donor community that it is vital
to assist the Palestinian people in coming to grips with their critical economic, institutional and
imrastructural problems as quickly as possible during this period of transition. There is also a consensus
amnong donors that IDA can, and should play a central intellectual, financial and coordinating role in this
endeavor. Further, without this assistance it is doubtful whether the peace can hold and the preconditions
for development be established. The ERP supports the OT's longer term economic stability and
development objectives and is consistent with IDA's assi3tance strategy for the OT. Given IDA's
development mandate, its capacity and its long experience with similar undertakings in other countries (see
para 18 above), it is in a good position to assist the OT with this difficult undertaking. This fact has been
acknowledged by the confidence placed in IDA by the donor community, and was reaffirmed at the
December 1993 CG meeting in Paris.
20.   Actions Agreed. The Palestinian leadership has taken initial actions to ensure effective project
implementation by announcing the establishment of PECDAR. Also, the general structure and operating
modalities of PECDAR (including the modalities for detailed subproject selection, design and implementa-
tion) and the terms of reference for consulting assignments were discussed and agreed prior to negotiations.
The following were discussed and agreed at negotiations: (i) the detailed implemntntation arrangements
for the first-year core program (para. 16); (ii); details of the cofinancing, procurement, disbursement,
accounting and reporting requirements; (iii) the scope, content and modalities of the formal half-yearly
joint project reviews (para. 16); (iv) appointment of the department heads and key staff of PECDAR,
including the director of PMO and the deputy director for Gaza (para. 15); (v) elaboration and
operationalization of the basic operaing systems of PECDAR, including particularly the accounting and
financial management, payment and personnel systems of the Operational Support Office, and the operating



7
systems of PMO (para. 15); (vi) recruitment and appointment of sector implementation consultants, on
terms and conditions acceptable to IDA to assist PMO in preparing and implementing the power and inter-
city transport components (para. 15); (vii) recruitment and appointment of the Consultants Panel,
comprising 12-15 competent local engineering/architectural/building consulting firms, on terms and
conditions acceptable to IDA, to assist municipalities and villages to prepare detailed designs and contract
documents, and supervise water and sanitation and municipal roads and facilities subprojects (paras. 15
and 16); (viii) issuance of request for proposals for the managing and procurement consultants, on terms
and conditions acceptable to IDA, to assist PMO (para. 15); (ix) ratification of PECDAR's bylaws by the
PNA (para 2). The Credit Agreement will be signed after confirmation of the function and responsibilities
of the Borrower by the Palestinian authorities which will take control of Gaza/Jericho under the agreement
to be reached through the ongoing negotiation between Israel and the PLO for withdrawal and transfer of
authority. The selection and appointment of the managing and procurement consultants on terns and
conditions acceptable to IDA is a condition of effectiveness.
21.   Enviromnental Aspects. The proposed project has been p'aced in environmental screening
category "B" consistent with the provisions of Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment."
Proposed sector programs have been subject to field-based review by IDA and consultant environmental
specialists. Currently, there are no known project proposals whose implementation would require
extensive land acquisition or result in involuntary resettlement. No known archaeological or historical sites
would be affected by activities to be supported. Implementation of the proposed project woulld result in
significant improvements in the management of water and wastewater in both the West Bank and Gaza.
Because of past experiences, the project would not support construction of new wastewater treatment plants
or sludge disposal facilities prior to a detailed environmental examination of the interventions in this area.
Activities under the project would redu^e the risk of pollution of the highly sensitive Gaza groundwater
aquifer. Rehabilitation of the road network would include improvements to drainage, thus reducing
flooding in municipalities and erosion; in addition, the resulting efficiencies in travel operations would
reduce air pollution. All activities would be subject to environmental review by the environmental
specialist in the PMO of PECDAR, the Palestinian Environmental Protection Authority an' ii A.
Ernvironmental mitigation and monitoring measures would be included as appropriate. Un.. he
complementary TAP, institutional development programs would be funded to support development of the
Palestinian environmental and cultural resources management authorities, including the preparation of
environmental assessment procedures and an environmental monitoring system.
22.   Program Objective Categories. The project would support the Palestinians' program to alleviate
poverty, build institutional capacity, improve and protect the environment, preserve public assets and
create an enabling environment for sLstainable private sector development.
23.   Benefits. The project would also have a particularly positive impact on employment: an estimated
10,000 man-years of direct employment in construction would be created. Further, by helping to improve
the delivery of essential infrastructural services, the project would provide other significant and widespread
social and economic benefits. Specifically, it would help: improve public health and education services;
protect and conserve sensitive and limited water resources, and reduce the losses due to network
inadequacies and inefficient utility operations; make a start in improving roads, reducing traffic congestion,
travel time, and vehicle operating costs; and improve the general quality of life for broad segments of the
population as well as overall economic efficiencies. The project would also help build consumer and
investor confidence, strengthen local institutions, and open up opportunities for private sector participation
and development through consulting, contracting, and manufacturing inputs. The benefits would accrue
to virtually all citizens of the OT, and particularly to low income families in Gaza and in the camps and
villages. Specific direct and indirect benefits would accrue approximately as follows: (a) Gaza: i) water
and sanitation - 460,000 persons; ii) municipal roads - 550,000 persons; iii) education - 150,000 children;



8
and (b) West Bank: i) water and sanitation - 60,000 persons; and ii) municipal roads - 300,000 persons.
(Note: benefits cannot be summed as this would result in double counting).
24.   Risks. ERP faces considerable risks, many of which ..qnnot be avoided. These risks fall into
three broad categories: (a) Political Risks: the success of the project requires stability in the OT, steady
progress in the bilateral and multilateral negotiations, and a maturation of internal political processes.
Instability and/or Israeli/Palestinian negotiation delays could significantly slow activities which depend on
their outcome and increase project costs. (b) Magerial and Technical Risks: Effective and timely
implementation of the project requires the early consolidation of PECDAR, including the appointment of
key staff; the early establishment of efficient operating systems and procedures and the appointment of key
consultants. (c) Program Risks: ERP is designed to support EAP, thus implementation of program
activities with a questionable technical or economic merit could undermine donor confidence and hence
program and project viability. Furthermore, the capacity of the local consulting and contracting industry
and the extent of foreign contractor interest is not known with precision, and contracting bottlenecks could
delay implementation. Political risks would be significant and difficult to manage. On the other hand,
success in providing tangible benefits to the Palestinian population through EAP and ERP could be
expected to reinforce the momentum for peace and thereby facilitate the success of the negotiations.
Managerial and technical risks would be minimized by providing technical assistance to ensure that
PECDAR is established on a sound operational basis (the latter being a condition of Board presentation),
by allocating as much responsibility as possible to existing institutions and supporting these institutions
with competent local consultants. Program risks would be minimized by establishing effective projxct
selection, screening and review mechanisms in PMO, and by employing competent local and foreign
consultants to weed out badly, conceived or designed subprojects. Also, the project has been specifically
designed to permit flexibility dunng implementation including the restructuring of key components, if
necessary. Finally, risks would be minimized by establishing appropriate monitoring, reporting and
control mechanisms, intensive IDA support during the first year and a half of PECDAR operations, and
by formal, half-yearly joint project reviews (para. 16).
25.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Trust Fund credit would comply with the
provisions of the Resolutions of the Executive Directors of the LBRD and IDA (Resolution No. 93-11 and
Resolution No. IDA 93-7) establishing the Trust Fund for Gaza, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.

existing political and institutional vacuum, provide a vast array of services. While the procedures and
practices of these NGOs require strengthening, they are generally well regarded and dominate the health,
housing and higher education sectors.
Sector Issues and Strategy
5.    From the analyses undertaken by IDA during 1993, it was concluded that the economy of the OT
was in crisis: income levels have stagnated for over a decade; unemployment and underemployment were
rising rapidly; the natural resource base was threatened; and public infrastructure and social services were
grossly inadequate. It was further concluded that the resulting deep se-nse of despair among broad
segments of the population was a major impediment to achieving peace and stability in the region, and that
without the latter the prospects for economic development were bleak. Thus, the cycle of despair, violence
and worsening economic conditions that has recured over the last 10 years seemed unending. However,
the signing of the September 1993 Declaration of Principles with Israel offers the possibility of breaking
the cycle. The EAP and this ERP, which is one of its key components, seeks to exploit this opportunity.
It seeks to provide much needed relief while helping to lay a sound foundation for sustainable
development.
6.    The EAP identified 10 sectors in which great need and opportunity were both clearly present:
education; health and welfare; power; telecommunications; water, wastewater and sanitation; inter-urban
roads and transport; municipal roads and facilities; solid waste; housing; and agriculture. Accordingly,
the Program sought to address these sectors on a priority basis, involving many donors in a massive three-
year assistance effort. By focussing jointly with PECDAR and a group of donors on four sectors
(education, power, water and roads) which are critical to long term economic and social development and
not currently being effectively addressed by other donors and international agencies,3 this project seeks to
make a significant contribution to the OT's development by addressing some of the most urgent social
needs and relieving the most critical infrastructure bottlenecks.
7.    A review of the key issues and proposed short and long-term strategies for the four sectors
included in ERP is presented in Appendix 3. A short summary of issues is presented below:
Education: Preserving the private preschool and university systems during the current funding
crisis-one due to the sharp drop in foreign assistance to the education system in recent years;
improving the quality of the formal education system; establishing a Palestinian authority with
responsibility for integrating and developing the education system; increasing investment in
vocational and technical education in order to reduce the scarcity of key technical skills and more
closely match supply to demand; improving the currently low educational outcomes, particularly
of children whose education has been interrupted by events during the Intifada.
Power: Inproving service to consumers by reducing network overload and the consequent damage
to consumer equipment due to low voltages and frequent outages; improving sector efficiency
through inproved training and operating systems and practices, and through consolidating existing
fragmented utilities into larger units to take advantage of economies of scale; and reducing
dependence on Israel for bulk supplies.
l/ The UN agencies, USAID and the EU ae involved in housing; Norway is focussing on power in Gaza; the
NGOs are involved in health, welfare and preschool and higher education; European donors and the EU are
involved in solid waste and sanitation; agriculture and telecoms is being left to the private sector.



18
Water, Wastewater and Sanitation: Improving water resource management md environmental
health conditions-particularly management of the Gaza aquifer; improving water supply delivery
systems; improving the sewerage collection, treatment and disposal system; improving wastewater
resource management; strengthening the institutional, financial and regulatory framework for the
management of water and wastewater.
Roads
a)    Inter-Urban. Arresting the deterioration and improving the quality of the existing inter-
urban road network; relieving congestion on key sections of the network, thereby reducing
air pollution, travel time and travel costs; improving accessibility to villages; and
strengthening institutional capacity to plan, manage and maintain the network.
b)    Municipal Roads and Facilies. Reducing urban transport costs and travel times;
increasing accessibility and safety; improving surface water dranage, thus reducing the
incidence of flooding and flood damage; preserving existing investment in infrastructure
and services; improving municipal facilities and preserving existing municipal assets
(markets, slaughter houses, offices, recreation facilities, etc.); and strengthening municipal
capacity to plan, finance, manage and maintain urban services and facilities.
In almost every sector, the core short-term issue is one of rehabilitating and/or rebuilding existing physical
structures and improving facilities and services, while beginning to rationalize existing institutions and
build longer-term institutional capacity. The basic strategy (and the strategy adopted by ERP) is to address
the worst of these problems while trying to quickly generate productive employment and laying the basis
for long-term development.4 Given the weakness of existing institutions and the uncertainty of the
situation, a key part of the strategy is to be flexible while providing support, and to use the feedback from
initial implementation efforts to refine project design. At the core of this strategy is a process of close
monitoring and review, and success will require very intensive IDA support during the first year, far
greater than is the norm.
II. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPIlON
Project Components
8.    The proposed project would help finance: (a) rehabilon, reconstruction and/or improvement
of priority bs sevices In four sectors: (i) education; (ii) power; (iii) water, wastewater and
sanitation; (iv) roads; and (b) Insdtutional support, capacity building and project mgement at local
and central levels. The project components are briefly described below.
A.    InfrstructeRabiliaton
i)    Educaton (US$20.S milon, 16 percent of total project cost). The immediate
objectives of this component are to sustain the current education system; reduce
overcrowding; and upgrade the quality and/or availability of teaching material,
4/ This would be supported through TAP.



19
facilities and plant in existing CA-managed primary and secondary schools in Gaza
and the West Bank.' The project would include the following sub-components:
a)    Rehabilitation and Improvement of Existing School Plant and
Equipment:   i) physical improvements  to  classrooms,
laboratories,  libraries,  gymnasia,  administrative  areas,
playgrounds and school boundary walls and fencing; and ii)
construction of new classroom blocks, libraries, laboratories and
gymnasia for existing schools;
b)    Provision of Essential Teaching Materials and Equipment: purchase
of books and essential laboratory and other teaching equipment and
supplies for primary and secondary schools (for two years); and
c)    Technical Assistance for Project Preparation and Implementation:
employment of suitably qualified local and foreign consultants to help
school authorities:   i) complete  project preparation, contract
documentation and bidding, and supervise construction; and ii) supervise
the specification, ordering, delivery and effective utilization of teaching
materials and supplier
Technical assistance would be provided through TAP to: study options
for developing an authority for the education sector and a pedagogic
institute, and strengthening of financial management in the education
sector; develop a remedial education program for children of the Intifada;
conduct school mapping studies; improve vocational education; and initiate
tracer studies of vocational, technical, and university graduates.
ii)    Power (US$10.0 million, 8 percent of total project cost). The objectives of this
component are: to effect immediate improvements to existing supply and
distribution networks and systems in the West Bank6 in order to ensure more
reliable power supply to customers; and to initiate steps to improve the efficiency,
reliability and sustainability of future supplies. The project would include the
following sub-components:
a)    Networks and Systems: the rebuilding of about 50 kms of low voltage
lines; reinforcing the 22 kV system by adding about 20 km of 22 kV
lines; adding 40 MVA of distribution transformer capacity; installing 5
MVAR of static capacitors;
b)    Essential Vehicles, Equipment, Supplies and Spares for Power
Utilities: purchase of vehicles, radios, billing equipment, tools, and
operating supplies such as transformer oil (for 2 years);
S/ This excludes the UNRWA-run schools in the refugee camps which would be funded separately through
EAP. Responsibility for the school system in Gaza is about evenly divided between the CA and UNRWA.
6/ GA is to be fnanced on a bilateral basis by Norway. Norway would also assist with studies and project
prepaation in the West Bank.



20
c)    Existing Buildings and Furnishin: repainng and improving existing
buildings including new furnishings and support facilities;
d)    New Buildings:  constructing, by turnkey contract, a prefabricated
building to serve as the project implementation headquarters for the
emergency project, on land that is already available; and
e)    Technical Assistance: employment of a highly qualified and experienced
international engineering firm (Project Engineers) to: i) complete program
preparation and bidding documents for the procurement of economically-
sized packages to repair, replace and upgrade the current distribution
system; and ii) supervise project implementation.
Note: Contractors recruitod on the basis of international competitive bidding
would be employed to undertake the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the RV
and LV system with support from the existing electricity departments of the
municipalities. An important aspect of this effort would be to quickly effect
technology transfer to Palestinian counterparts. Also important is the availability
of central sites with suitable buildings for the contractors implementing the sector
program. These would serve as a staging area to: receive, store, assemble, and
maintain equipment; house specialized tools; fuel and maintain vehicles; and
provide for centralized communications. This would permit works to proceed
efficiently during project implementation, and, equally importanty, serve as the
nucleus of a futre regional electric distribution utility. Many of the systems that
the contractors would have to put in place to implement the emergency program,
such as a computerized stores control system, would be available for transfer to
a future regional utilities.
ii)    Water Supy, Wastewater and Saitation (US$39.4 millon, 31 percent of
total project cost). The objectives of this component are to: support the
rehabilitation, upgradig and extension of high priority works for water supply,
stormwater and sewage collection/distribution networks in the municipalities and
camps of Gaza and the northern West Bank districts; and meet the immediate
O&M equipment needs of all municipalities and utilities operating in the sector.
The project would ir-lude the following sub-components:
a)    Water Supply Distrbution Networks: upgrading of existing wells,
reticulation networks and storage facilities in municipalities, villages and
camps;
b)    Stormwater and Sewerage Networks: (i) limited improvements to
existng stormwater collection networks; (ii) upgrading and extension of
existing sewerage systems and limited upgrading of treatment plants;
c)    New Wells: installation of a limited nunber of new wells to meet basic
demand requirements;
2/ Ibe long-tam pln calls the consolidation of the cren fmentedl and inefficient mumicip system.



21
d)     Village Water Supplies: support to village water supply improvements in
27 villages in the West Bank are expected to be funded from other
sources. If not, they would be considered for high priority substitute
subprojects;
e)     Essential Vehicles, Equipment, Spares and Supplies: acquisition of
vehicles, equipment, spares, tools and supplies to meet the basic O&M
needs of water, wastewater and sanitation utilities (for 2 years); I and
f)     Technical Assistance: employment of qualified and experienced locally
recruited civil engineering firms to assist municipalities to prepare and
implement subprojects.
Limited upgrading of sewage treatment plants would be considered for support
under the project, but major investments would be deferred until more detailed
technical, enviromnental and economic studies to establish the viability of
wastewater reuse are completed. Also, investment in new wells would be delayed
if detailed hydrological and enviromnental studies have not been completed and
permits for drilling cannot be obtained.9
iv)    Roads
a)    Inter-Urban Roads (US$15.2 million, 12 percent of total project cost).
The objectives of this component are to: strengthen and rehabilitae the
main road network; establish a capability to undertake routine and
periodic maintenance; and provide all-weather access to villages. The
focus would be on implementing thA first half of a five-year highway
rehabilitation and maintenance program in Gaza and the West Bank.'0
The project would include the following sub-components:
i.    Inter-Urban Road Network: rehabilitation of and improvements
to about 100 kn of main roads;
ii.    Vfllage Access Roads: rehabilitation of and improvements to
about 50 km serving a total of some 15 villages;
8/ More substantial items would be delayed until detailed technical, economic and enviromen   analyses have
been completed. These, together with the more specific needs of municipalities and villages would be
considered for financing in a follow-up project.
9/ The above would be considered for financing in a follow-up project.
10/ The size of the program is constrained by the initial institutional capacity and lack of designs. Furthenmore,
demands on cntractors in other sectors, particularly municipal roads, will limit what can be achieved under
the inter-urban road program. The roads program has, therefore, been designed to expand gradually duing
the first year.



22
iii.   Inter-Urban Road Maintenance by Contract: development and
implementation of a program of routine and periodic maintenance
on the main road network;
iv.    Vehicles, Equipment, Materials and Spares: the purchase of a
limited quantity of guard rails and reflective posts for
mountainous and dangerous sections of the main road system in
the West Bank; essential vehicles and equipment for road
program supervision and maintenance; essential laboratory and
office equipment, training materials and equipment; and of
essential spares (for 2 years);
v.    Office Rental: the rental for a two-year period of office space to
house the inter-urban and village access road rehabilitation and
maintenance project staff; and
vi.   Technical Assistance: employment of qualified and experienced
international engineering consultants to assist PECDAR and the
highways department of the Gaza CA to: i) complete program
preparation and bidding documents for the procurement of
economically-sized packages; ii) supervise project implementation;
iii) train the Gaza CA's highway planning and maintenance staff;
and iv) lay the foundation in the Gaza CA for the development of
a Highway Authority for both Gaza and the West Bank.
b)    Munidpal Roads and Facilities (US$34.8 mflion, 27 percent of total
project cost). The objectives of this component are to: arrest the
deterioration of the most critical (highly trafficked) sections of the
municipal road network; preserve urban assets;  improve traffic
circulation; reduce travel time and cost; and generally improve the
cleanliness of the environment and the efficiency of the urban system.
The project includes the following sub-components:
i.    Municipal Road Network: rehabilitation of and improvements
to about 250 km of main and secondary roads in Gaza and the
West Bank, including refugee camp roads;
ii.    Village Roads: rehabilitation of and improvements to about 50
km of main internal roads in about 15 villages in Gaza and the
West Bank;
iii.   Urban Road Maintenance by Contract: development and
implementation of a program of routine and periodic maintenance
of the main and secondary road network in Gaza and the West
Bank;

iv.    Municdpal Failities: completion of and improvements to parms,
playgrounds, fire protection services, markets, slaughter houses,
municipal workshops, etc.; 11
v.     Municdpal Clean-Up Campaign: development and implementa-
tion of short-term  (3-month) program to remove accumulated
debris from the main streets and prominent sites in selected
municipalities and villages, and to dispose this debris in
environmentally safe areas and in an environmentally responsible
manner;
vi.    Vehicles, Equipment, Materials and Spares: the purchase of:
i) essential vehicles, equipment, tools supplies and spares (for 2
years) for road program supervision and maintenance; essential
office equipment; and iii) training materials and equipment; and
vii.   Technical  Assistance:    employment of qualified  local
engineering firms to assist municipalities and villages to:
i) complete program preparation and bidding docmets;
ii) supervise project implementation; and iii) train municipal road
planning, management and maintenance staff.
B.    Instituonal Support, Capacity Building and Project ManagemeIt
The objective of this component is to help strengthen the municipalities, support the establishment
operations and development of PECDAR, and ensure that the proposed project is efficiently and
effectively implemented. The component (US$8.1 million, 6 percent of total project cost)
would help support PECDAR's setup and operating costs and the full costs of PECDAR's
managing and procurement consultants. It includes the following sub-components:
i)     Incremental Operating Expenses: support for i) employment of essentil staff;
ii) rental of essential office space; iii) utilities, including, inter alia, water, power
and communications; and iv) vehicle operating and servicing costs;
ii)    Training and Studies: support for training courses, seminars, workshops and
studies essential for establishing effective planning, management and operating
systems for PECDAR's staff and the staff of municipalities, for ensuring effective
project coordination at central and municipal levels; and
11/ Many municipalities have concept plans and even detailed designs, for projects such as parks, playgrounds,
fire protection services, markets, slaughter houses, municipal workshops, etc., which are presedtly lacking.
It is necessary for each of these proposals to be subjected to detailed analysis and/or review before they can
be accepted for funding. TA for this purpose would be included in the ERP and TAP. However, a few of
these projects are partly completed (e.g., municipal building, El Bireh) and need funds to be completed and
put to beneficial use. This sub-component would therefore provide funding for such projects, on a cae-by-
case basis, after clear justification and screening.



24
iii)    Vehides, Equipment, Supplies and Snares: support for the purchase of
essential vehicles, office equipment (including, inter alia, computers, copying
machines, and fax machines), supplies (including, inter alia, office supplies) and
spares.
iv)    Consultants' Services:  support for the employment of: i) Managing and
Procurement Consultants to assist PMO with, inter alia, detailed project
preparation, planning, programming, monitoring, reporting, with bulkpurchasing
of goods and selective procurement of goods, works and services for cofinanced
subcomponents; and ii) auditors for the project and PECDAR itself.
Project Design and Selection Criteria
9.      The project has been designed and would be implemented under difficult and unusual
circumstances, including, inter alia: a) high political, economic and institutional uncertainty; b) absence
of effective or appropriate existing state institutions; and c) extremely short project identification and
preparation time. Also, although a set of core, first year subprojects have been identified and appraised
(para. 11), other potential projects need to be reviewed. In order to respond to these and other
constraints and opportunities that may arise during implementation, the project has been designed to be
both flexible and open-ended. Thus, during implementation and with the prior approval of IDA,
already identified subprojects may be replaced with other feasible high-priority subprojects and new
subprojects included.
10.   To facilitate this flexibility while ensuring objectivity, transparency, and that only high priority
subprojects qualify for support, a screening process and a set of selection criteria have been agreed.
In order to be eligible for funding, new projects and projects identified by IDA and Palestinian authorities
as requiring further detailed design, costing and evaluation, projects would first be screened and approved
on the basis of the following agreed criteria:
a)    economic and technical feasibility;
b)    readiness for implementation:
c)    enviromnental impact;
d)    consistency with program and project objectives and short-term sector strategies;
e)    community social and/or economic priority;
f)    economic and social impact;
g)    distributional equity; and
h)    avoidance of unaffordable recurrent cost commitments.



25
These criteria would be elaborated and operationalized by the managing and procurement consultants
(MC) after consultation with PECDAR and IDA (see para. 15), and would be fairly, explicitly and
transparently applied.12 The evaluation of subprojects would be clearly docunmented in quarterly reports
to IDA (see para. 27 below).
Flrst Year Core Subprojects
11.   On the basis of the criteria outlined above (para. 10), about 89 priority subprojects estimated to
cost US$37.8 million have been identified as capable of being implemented during the first year of the
project. Contract documents are available for about 10 subprojects. Documents for the rest of the core
can be finalized in the next 3-6 months. Of the 89 core subprojects, 46 are in the water and wastewater
subsectors (Gaza: 37; West Bank: 9), at an estimated cost of US$14.2 million (Gaza: US$8.4 million;
West Bank: US$5.8 million); 43 are in the municipal roads subsectors (Gaza: 30; West Bank: 13) at an
estimated cost of US$23.6 million (Gaza: US$13.4 million; West Bank: US$10.2 million). Further
details on these subprojects are presented in Appendix 7 and in the Project Files. While the above
subprojects constitute a solid basis for project implementation, they are not all expected to be
implemented in year one. Also, these are not the only subprojects which could be implemented in the
first year. For example, the Salah El-Din inter-urban road in Gaza could begin implementation in year
one if detailed engineering studies are expedited. Similarly, a number of rehabilitation subprojects in the
education sector could also be implemented if preparatory studies are expedited.
m.  INSTIUIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND IMLEMENTATION
implementation Arrangements and Responsibilities
12.   The institutional arrangements for the proposed project would be similar to those for EAP; both
would depend heavily on PECDAR. Project implementation arrangements are outlined below.
Summaries of EAP and TAP are presented in Appendices 1 and 2, respectively; a more detailed
description of the project and program implementation arrangements, including organizational charts, in
Appendix 4;13 and an implementation schedule in Appendix 5. 14
13.   The project would be implemented over a three-year period begiming July 1, 1994 and ending
June 30, 1997. The closing date would be December 31, 1997. Overall responsibility for policy and
program guidance would lie with PECDAR's Board of Governors. However, responsibility for project
implementation, monitoring and reporting would lie with PECDAR's management, primarily the Director
of the Program Management and Monitoring Office (PMO) of PECDAR.
14.   In order to ensure that PECDAR can mobilize quickly and yet remain a lean and effective
organization, PMO would rely on the services of competent managing and procurement consultants (MC),
a firm recruted internatonally on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. And to avoid the danger
of over-centralization and ensure that local needs and priorities are effectively attended to, the PMO
would establish a sub-office in Gaza (the Gaza office). In addition to its director and a deputy director
12/ PECDAR would establish a small subcommittee for this purpose (see r .. 15 below).
13/ EAP and ERP share institutional arrangements. Thus, for economy of exposition, the description presented
in Appendix 4 covers the implementaion arrangements for both program and project.
jV Summiy cost estimates ere presented in Appendix 6.



26
for the Gaza office, the PMO would be staffed by about 11 sector specialists1' who would assist the
director and deputy director on policy, technical and institutional matters related to effective project
identification, preparation, evaluation and implementation. PMO would also employ the services of a
qualified procurement officer who would assist the director and deputy director with routine procurement
matters, and would liaise with the MC. The appointment of the MC on terms and conditions acceptable
to IDA is a condition of effeciveness.
15. The MC would report to the director of PMO, and would assist the director and deputy directors
of PMO with, inter alia, the following: 16
a)     overall programming and budgeting-including periodic (at least quarterly) revision and
updating to ensure attaimnent of program and project objectives;
b)    developing, instituting and operating effective manual and computer-based operating
procedures and systems for project management, including, inter alia, project information
systems and systems for critical path analysis;
c)    project screening,'7 evaluation and recommendation for selection (see para. 10);'"
d)    reviewing contract preparation, evaluation and award;
e)     project, sub-project and contract monitoring;
f)    reviewing contract claims and payment certification;19
g)    project and sub-project data processing and accounting;'
h)    preparation of disbursement requests;
i)    ensuring compliance with financial, audit and other project covenants;
j)     project monitoring and reporting;
k)    liaison with implementing agencies on other issues necessary for ensuring cost-effective
and timely implementation; and
IW/ This number includes speciists for EAP as well.
6/ The terms of reference for the MC have been discussed and agreed.
17/ PECDAR would establish a small (4-5 person) screening sub-committee comprised mainly of technical
specialists from PMO, representaives of the economics department and the MC. The latter would act as a
Secetariat.
Il/ Responsibility for final selection would lie with the deputy managing director of PECDAR, on the
recommendation of the PMO director and the director for Economic Policy.
12/ All payments would be made by the accounts department of PECDAR's Support Services Office.
20/ The prepration of consolidated proiect accounts would be the responsiblity of PECDAR's Accounts
Depatment. The PMO/MC would prepare and provide the inuts for these accounts.



27
1)    the bulk procurement of goods and selective procurement2' of works and services
required for the effective implementation of the project.
16.   Responsibility for sub-sector and subproject implementation is summarized below:

Successors               Consultants
- Municipal Roads        Municipalities            Local Consultants Panel
and Facilities
To the extent possible, PMO would rely on existing institutions and agencies-mainly the municipalities-to
execute subprojects. In order to expedite project implementation, municipalities would be given
considerable autonomy in contracting for works costing US$0.25 million or less' in the water, waste
water, sanitation, and municipal roads and facilities subsectors. But because most municipalities are weak
and/or need assistance with project preparation and supervision, PECDAR, on the basis of requests for
proposals and on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA would select a panel of 12-15 qualified and
experienced local civil/structural/mechanical engineering and architectural firms (the local consultants
panel). This panel of firms would be pre-approved to assist municipalities and villages on a self-selecting
basis to identify, prepare, contract, and supervise infrastructure rehabilitation and improvement projects
suitable for financing under the project. To expedite the preparation of the first year core subprojects,
a nuniber of local consultants, and/or joint ventures of local and international consultants, would be
appointed by PECDAR, on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, to prepare these projects for
tendering.
I/ Procurement financed on a parallel basis by donors, using their own procedures.
2I This limit would be reviewed periodically by PECDAR and adjusted upwards as municipalities demonstrated
capacity to effectively manage subprojects.
23/ The terms of reference for these local consultants have been discssed and agreed with PECDAR.



28
17.   Because the interventions involved are complex and/or inter-jurisdictional, in the power and inter-
urban roads subsectors PMO would take more direct responsibility for project preparation and
implementation. In these cases, PMO would employ the services of sector implementation consultants
(SICs) who would be recruited internationally on terms and conditions acceptable to WDA.24 These
consultants would be given relatively wide authority by PMO to prepare and supervise the implementation
of projects in these subsectors, and they would liaise closely with municipalities and the CAs in doing so.
PMO would also take direct responsibility for preparing and implementing inter-municipal2 subprojects
and for major subprojects (costing more than US$3 million). It would similarly recruit and contract
consultants for these purposes.
18.   FleIdbility and Semi-Annual Project Reviews: Finally, to ensure flexibility in the face of
uncertain circumstances, while also ensuring effective project implementation, PECDAR's role, structure
and performance and the structure and progress of the project and subprojects would be re-examined
periodically. This would be done in formal, joint half-yearly project reviews by IDA and PECDAR's
senior management (including, inter ala, managing and deputy managing directors, and director of
PMO).2 At these joint reviews, any revisions necessaryV to improve project implementation and to attain
essential project objectives would be made on the basis of mutual consent and duly recorded in the minutes
of the review meeting.
Project Costs and Finncdng
19.   The total project cost is estimated at US$128 miulioP with a foreign exchange component of US$
65.6 million or about 51 percent of total costs. The estimated total project cost is net of taxes and duties,
a waiver from which has been sought from the Israeli Government. Base cost estimates are calculated
using January 1994 prices. The physical contingencies represent 10 percent of base costs. Price
contingencies are derived from expected foreign price increases of 3.1 percent per annum over the three-
year implementation period beginning on July 1, 1994. The proposed Gaza Trust Fund credit of US$30
million equivalent on IDA terms would finance 23 percent of total costs.
W/ The terms of reference for the inter-urban roads SIC has been discussed and agreed with PECDAR.
25 nuerpreted to mean projects outside the jurisdiction of individual municipalities, rather than those spanning
jurisdictions. In the latter case, PECDAR would only play a direct coordinating role if the municipalities are
unable to cope.
26 The political and institutional situation in the OT is in considerable flux. Thus, PECDAR's likely role
beyond the project and the program is not known. It is possible that, as things stabilize, sections of
PECDAR could become the core of entire new ministries and PECDAR disbanded in whole or in part.
Another scenario is that PECDAR could become a "muinistry of economy and planning." In any case, it
seems certain that its role will have to be rvisited during the life of the project as circumstances warant.
During implementation, the project would provide for consultation on and, if necessary, the adjustment of
PECDAR's role. For these and the other reasons stated above, it is desirable that the number of PECDAR's
core staff be kept as small as possible.
21/ Including revisions to project structure as well as ralllocations of funds within and between categories.
2&1 All cost estimates exclude provisions for taxation, a waiver from which has been sought from Irael.

Cofincng
20.   Cofinancing of US$98 million has been pledged by donors.' The financing plan for the projer*
is shown in Schedule A, page 2 of the Memorandum and Recommendation of the President. Additionm
cofinancing pledges have been voiced by donors.' These have not been confirmed however. If
confirmation of these pledges is received prior to Board presentation, consideration would be given to
increasing the project size, and the cofinancing plan and arrangements would be modified accordingly.3'
Procurement
21.   Procurement methods for works, goods and services to be financed under the proposed loan are
summarized in Schedule B of ihe Memorandum and Recommendation of the President. It was agreed that
all procurement under the project would be coordinated and monitored by PECDAR. The municipalities,
assisted by consultants (para. 16) would be responsible for subproject preparation, bidding and evaluation.
In addition, the successor to the Gaza CA would be assisted by PECDAR in any procurement. Detailed
procurement arrangements are set out in Appendix 8. Because of the emergency nature of the project, part
of the procurement would be undertaken using simplified competitive bidding procedures in accordance
with IDA Guidelines. All equipment and materials, works and services to be financed under the project
jointly, or solely, by IDA would be procured in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for Procurement (May
1992) with the two exceptions of (a) one-half of the Danish grant would be reserved for procurement of
Danish goods and services, and (b) IDA would administer a Saudi Fund grant (and potential Kuwait and
UAE grants, see para. 14 of MOP) in all aspects save for decisions with respect to procurement which will
be made by the Saudi Fund according to its eligibility requirements. A procurement notice advertising
the project has been published in the United Nations Development Business, and PECDAR would publish
the same notice in the local press and to local representatives of eligible countries that are potential
suppliers of the goods and works required.
Disbursements
22.   Given the emergency nature of the proposed project, the implementation period would be 36
months, and the credit would be disbursed through PECDAR. Disbursements are expected to begin on
July 1, 1994 and be completed by December 31, 1997, which will be the closing date. Schedule B of the
Memorandum and Recommendation of the President shows the estimated credit disbursements by quarter.
23.   The proposed credit of US$30 million equivalent would be disbursed against the categories stated
below at the rate of 100 percent of expenditures:32
(1)   Works: Gaza
29/ Joint: Demark - US$10 million; Switzerland - US$8 million; Parallel: Denmark - US$10 million; Arab
Fund - US$30 million; Saudi Fund - US$30 million, and Kuwait Fund - US$ 10 million.
30/ Japan - US$8 million; and United Arab Emirates (UAE) - US$25 million.
31/ A number of small pledges (less than US$5 million each) involving tied funds have been made, but it was
decided that inclusion of these would greatly encumber implementation. Donors would be encouraged to
make separate bilateal arrangements with PECDAR.
32 This very high rate is determined by the fact that this is an emergency situation, and that PECDAR is in nc
cneitinn finamciallv to bear a share of oroiect costs.

31
In preparation for these reviews, PECDAR would submit annual and mid-year project reports to IDA no
later than four weeks before the date of the half-yearly joint reviews.
Supervision Plan
28.   The project is both complex and politically sensitive. Existing implementing institutions are weak;
a key new institution (PECDAR) has been created to manage the project; and the entire political and
economic environment is in flux. In addition, a considerable amount of cofinancing is involved,
necessitating constant donor coordination. The implementation arrangements need to be monitored closely
and quickly revised, if necessary. Careful attention will therefore have to be paid to supervision,
particularly during the first year and one half when the basic legal, institutional, fiscal and financial
framework are being elaborated. The deployment of IDA supervision staff in the field for extended
periods, at least during the first year and one half (and continuously during the first six months) of the
project, is proposed. This deployment would be essential and could make the difference between success
and failure in the current uncertain circumstances. After year two, supervision requirements should
decrease considerably, except for the formal joint half-yearly review. Supervision will be aided by the
monitoring and reporting framework that would be developed and implemented by PMO, assisted by the
managing consultants (para. 15).
29.   IDA Supervision Input: Staff input into supervision will take the following form:
(a)    Portfolio Management Operations. Review at headquarters of work programs/schedules,
reports, detailed sub-project proposals, contracts and financial statements and
correspondence and internal reporting related to such activities are estimated to require 40-
60 staffweeks in the first two years of project implementation, reducing to about 20-30
staffweeks in the third year.
(b)    Field Supervision.  Apart from a continuous presence during the first six months,
supervision of the project in the field will generally involve three missions per year, tied
to key project stages as indicated in the Field Supervision Plan in Appendix 10.
Supervision would comprise four broad areas:
i) Review of the institutional arrangements for the project, including the role, structure,
systems and performance of PMO and consultants;
ii) Review of project preparatior including the progress and quality of the work of the
consultants;
iii) Review of cofinancing, procurement, disbursement, project costs and financial and
physical performance and projections; and
iv) Review of coordination with other program components and with EAP and TAP; and
review of complementary activities of donors and donor coordination.
Agreements Reached
30    The Palestinian leadership has taken initial actions to ensure effective project implementation by
announcing the establishment of PECDAR. Also, the general structure and operating modalities of
PECDAR. including the modalities for detailed sub-project selection, design and implementation (paras.
9-11) and the terms of reference for the MC and SIC (para. 15) were agreed prior to negotiations. The
following were agreed at negotiations:



32
i)    the detailed implementation arrangements for the first year core subprojects (para. 11);
ii)    details of the cofinancing, procurement, disbursement, accounting and repordng
requirements, including the operations of the Special Accounts (paras. 20-27);
iii)   the scope, content and modalities of the formal half yearly joint project reviews (para. 18);
iv)    appointment of the department heads and key staff of PECDAR, including the director
of PMO and deputy director for Gaza (paras. 13-16);
v)    the elaboration and operationalization of the basic operating systems of PECDAR,
including particularly the accounting and financial management, payment and personnel
systems of the Operational Support Office, and the operating systems of PMO (paras. 12-
16);
vi)   the recruitment and appointment of a sector implementation consultants, on terms and
conditions acceptable to IDA to assist PMO in preparing and implementing the power and
inter-city roads components (para. 17);
vii)  the recruitment and appointment of a Consultants Panel comprising 12-15 competent local
engineering/architectural/building consulting firms, on terms and conditions acceptable to
IDA, to assist municipalities and villages to prepare detailed designs and contract
documents, and supervise water and sanitation and municipal roads and facilities
subprojects (para. 16);
viii)  issuance of requests for proposal for the MC, on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA,
to assist PMO (para. 14); and
ix)   the ratification of the bylaws of PECDAR by the PNA.
The Credit Agreement will be signed after confirmation of the function and responsibilities of the Borrower
by the Palestinian authorities which will take control of Gaza/Jericho under the agreement to be reached
through the ongoing negotiation between Israel and the PLO for withdrawal and transfer of authority.
31.   Conditions of Effectiveness. The appointment of the MC on terms and conditions acceptable to
IDA is a condition of effectiveness.



33
APPENDIX 1
THE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (EAP)'
Progam Objectives and Components
1.    The overarching objective of the EAP is to deliver tangible benefits to the Palestinian population
quickly, equitably and effectively while laying the foundation for sustainable development over the long
term. The Program has three broad components; it provides support for: (i) investment in public
infrastructure; (ii) private sector investments; and (iii) start-up expenditure support for the central
administration, municipalities, NGOs and UNRWA. The choice of these components reflects the
overriding importance of enmancing the impact of the program in terms of time and distributional impact.
While the public infrastructure component would provide benefits to most Palestinians, its impact in terms
of employment would become significant only in the latter part of the program. Over the longer-term,
the private sector would have to be the main engine of growth for the OT economy. However, over the
short-term, because of inadequacies of the financial system, support to the private sector wril remain
modest, and its impact will not emerge until later in the program. Hence, the need for fast-disbursing
budget support in the initial years of the program. Hundreds of NGOs generally perform a useful
function, although many have recently lost traditional sources of support. Additional support to NGOs
is proposed under the program, with a major focus on women and children, the Council of Higher
Education (which has been most heavily affected by the loss of financial support) and selected health care
facilities. With implementation capacity of the municipalities being limited, the program uses
implementation capacity available in NGOs and UNRWA to expand the program impact, and to reach the
large population of refugees, notably in Gaza.
2.    Public Sector Investment. The core of the program would focus on infrastructure and human
resources, where the public sector is expected to play a major role for some time to come. The poor
current state of infrastructural services needs immediate remedial attendon. The immediate focus would
be on upgrading, repair and maintenance of existing facilities; however, new construction, particularly
during the later stages of the program would also be important. This initial focus reflects the broad
impact of such investments and their impact on employment. In some sub-sectors (power, water,
telecommunications) with long-term needs for institutional restructuring, implementation arrangements
would plant the seeds for adjustment. In others, the analytical basis for institutional and policy decisions
would be prepared through TA. Preparation of longer term plans and policies would be supported by
technical assistance for strategic planning, institutional development and investment implementation.
3.    Future economic growth and human well-being in the OT will depend significantly upon
development of its human resources. The strategy is to maintain essential services while initiating
institutional, policy and structural reforms. In the health sector, the availability of generally ample
services suggests that the exisdng infrastructure should be maintained until more fumdamental decisions
can be made to adjust the sector structure. In the education sector, the key issue of quality would begin
to be addressed, while fundamental institutional changes should be analyzed and prepared.
I/ Details are presented in "Emergency Assistance Program for the Occupied Territories", World Bank,
December 7, 1993. This document is in the project file. The cost data have been revised to reflect curm
estimates.



34
4.    Support to the Private Sector. Stimulating private sector investment and growth in the productive
sectors and services is essential for sustainable development in the OT and, particularly, for generating
employment opportunities. In view of the current uncertainty that characterizes the investment and general
business climate, investor confidence in low and interest in term investment (with the exception of
investment in real estate), subdued. Private sector investment is limited primarily to equity flows with
some investors able to obtain loans under bilaterally-supported credit programs channelled through a small
number of new and relatively inexperienced credit institutions. The challenge of increasing private sector
ifivestment, starting from this base, is significant and must rely, inter alia, on the development of the
financial system and related expansion of credit and other financial services.
5.    The strategy of the emergency assistance program would be to support the development of the
financial system including the strengthening of credit institutions. In parallel, the program includes long-
term funds support to be channelled for private sector activities. Such support is proposed to be provided
through an Apex bank facility which would channel long-term funds to local credit institutions for on-
lending to support private investment. Such on-lending would support development of various sectors
including agriculture, housing, industry and tourism. In some of these sectors, existing credit institutions
(e.g., in agriculture) need to be strengthened, and in other sectors, key policy issues (e.g., zoning laws
in housing) remain to be addressed before lending can take place on any significant scale. Consequently,
progress in on-lending funds for private investment can be expected to build up in the later years of the
program.
6.    In the Agricultural Sector, the combination of expanding production and declining external markets
within a highly constrained regulatory and natural resource framework is clearly unsustainable. The key
issue is that the agricultural sector produces more than it can sell, and uses unsustainable amounts of water
in Gaza and to a lesser extent in the West Bank.
7.    Other related issues concern internal transport restrictions, modest technology improvement, the
need for adjustment of the regulatory framework, and the need for natural resource management. The
trade, regulatory and natural resource management issues are directly related to ongoing bilateral
negotiations. Lack of funding is also a problem in public services provided by the CA and NGOs. As
in other sectors, the future shape and role of public institutions and NGOs and policy in the sector needs
to be clarified. The short-term strategy would be to prepare for the transfer of authority, to initiate steps
for future adjustment of the production patterns, to maintain essential sector support services and to
imxprove existing infrastructure. In addition, support to the private sector through the funding arrangement
elaborated above would assist the sector. Most of the health component and a significant part of the
education component of the program would be implemented through NGOs.
8.    Start-up Expenditure Support. The program would provide support to four categories of
activities: (i) expansion of the implementation capacity of the municipalities and villages; (ii) central
administrative support; (iii) UNRWA's planned incremental program; and (iv) incremental planned
activities of the NGOs.
9.    Central Ad    sion  Current support for the ongoing relief works program of the CA would
stop following the transfer of authority. The program has had a major impact on local employment
(estimated at some 15,000 people), and has been a major factor in dealing with the explosion of
unemployment, especially in Gaza, during the past year. Its discontinuation at the critical juncture of the
transition would have major implications. While funding of the program would be a legitimate function
of the Palestinian CA, it appears unlikely that the projected tax effort for the first year would be able to
support such program. Given the critical impact on employment, the emergency program would support
the relief program for the first year, after which it is expected that the impact of the overall emergency



35
program on local employment would provide adequate alternative employment opportunities and allow for
a phasing down of the relief program. The budgetary support required by the Palestinian administration
for current expenditure is estimated at US$108 million in 1994, and no such support is envisaged for either
1995 or 1996.
10.   In addition to the expenditures of the central administration, there are two other current
expenditures of the public sector that need to be financed from new commitments (i.e., over and above
on-going programs). One of these would be support for the current expenditures of the municipalities to
help strengthen their implementation capacity as they attempt to implement a higher level of investment
under the Emergency Assistance Program. Second, is additional support to the NGOs whose finances had
been strained after the Gulf War with the reduction in Arab aid, as well as to the NGOs dealing with
women and children issues. During the past 25 years, Palestinian society has developed a broad spectrum
of institutions and organizations which supplement the services provided by the public sector. Over 900
NGOs exist at present. Many are affected by reduced budgetary support. While receiving substantial
resources in the past, NGO accountability and transparency of funding have often been lacking. Most
disbursement have gone to social activities in health, education and welfare. Given their important role,
and despite abuses of the past, the NGO sector is an immensely valuable resource worth preserving. The
program would facilitate this process by providing support for worthwhile activities of NGOs (in
education, health, agriculture, as detailed before), and for general welfare activities, but under conditions
which enforce economic accountability, transparency and minimum professional standards. Requiring
registration and audits, the program would encourage the continuation of the traditional channel of direct
funding to the NGOs, while applying new 'rules of the game' in terms of selection of activities,
monitoring of implementation and enforcement of accountability. Immediate steps are needed to establish
a fund for the support of youth and women programs through agencies experienced in administrating such
support (e.g., UNICEF).
11.   The total cost of the EAP, summarized in the following table, is estimated at US$1.2 billion, of
which about 41 percent would be spent in Gaza. Public investment support would constitute 50 percent
of the program, support to the private sector 25 percent, and incremental recurrent expenditure support
21 percent. About 40 percent of the program would be implemented by the municipalities or newly
established sector implementation units working in collaboration with the municipalities, about 12 percent
by UNRWA, 13 percent by NGOs and 23 percent by the private sector. Five percent would support
central administration budget support and the remainder would support the Housing Council.
12.   The overall size of the program has been determined in relation to the likely external and internal
financial resources available during the three-year program period, but also to the likely overall
implementation capacity to handle foreign-financed projects. Although assessment of the impact of
implementation capacity and finance on the program size is largely judgmental, a size in excess of the
proposed program is likely to create considerable administrative bottlenecks, especially if many projects
were financed in parallel by a multitude of donors. Since much investment is dependent on engineering
studies carried out through technical assistance, the implementation of technical assistance may well be
another constraint. (Program components and costs are summarized in the table below.)

APPENDIX 2
THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM C(AP)'
Program Components
1.    The Technical Assistance Program is an integral part of IDA's strategy to support the OT and
complements EAP and ERP. It includes: a) measures to quickly enhance administrative capacity and begin
to build Palestinian institutions; b) funding for policy studies; and c) feasibility studies to prepare longer-
term investments for international support. The activities in each sector (infrastructure, human resources,
economic management and private sector) and subsector being supported are described in the TAP report.
The TAP activities which support ERP are summarized in the following paragraphs,2 and a summary of
priority TAP tasks and estimate of costs is presented in the accompanying table.
2.    Education. The current system is unbalanced and has major quality problems. It is biased toward
university, rather than vocational and technical education. The long-term strategy needs to focus on the
core issues of quality and relevance. Technical assistance would assist completion of a school mapping
study to plan investments in new schools and begin the planning aaid design of long-term curricular and
pedagogic reforms. It includes professional analysis and training to improve the financial management of
educational institutions and the financial sustainability of the educational system as a whole. Finally, it
would begin to reverse the current imbalance between university and vocational and technical education
by support to a vocational education task force. The estimated cost of the five TA activities in the sector
is expected to total US$3.4 million over the next three years. Three TA activities are planned to begin
in the period through June 1994.
3.    Electric Power. The proposed power sector investments, totalling US$121 million, to improve
the distribution networks in Gaza and the West Bank will only be fully effective and sustainable if parallel
steps are taken to: (i) improve the capacity of Palestinians to manage and maintain the distribution
networks; (ii) develop an institutional and regulatory framework; and (iii) reduce losses due to technical
factors and theft. TA is available to help complete project preparation so that there is an early 1994 start
to the investments to be financed under the ERP, to recommend institutional consolidation to provide an
improved regional basis for efficient and safe utility operations and to plan longer-term investments. The
cost of the three TA activities is expected to total US$3.3 million over the next three years, excluding a
contract to provide project implementation management over 27 months. This contract is to be financed
under the ERP and other projects, and is not included in the TA Program. In addition, an institutional
and regulatory study is to be carried out jointly for electric power, telecommunications and post. One TA
activity is planned to begin in the period through June 1994.
4.    Water and Sanitaion. TA would be provided to meet four broad objectives of the sector
strategy: (i) initiate institutional reform at the center and develop coherent water conservation policies and
practices; (ii) establish a unified water and sewerage utility for Ramallah District, as a model utility, and

develop proposals for creating comparable agencies in Gaza and other regions of the West Bank; (iii)
review wastewater treatment and re-use technologies and develop investment proposals consistent with local
constraints and conditions; and (iv) support implementation of the recommended Emergency Assistance
Program though advisory consulting services, training and project preparation facilities, During the next
three-year period, the TA would meet priority rehabilitation and network requirements while laying the
basis for long-term institutional reform. Ten technical assistance activities are proposed during the next
three years, five of which are expected to be carried out by UNRWA or UNDP. The estimated cost is
US$4.7 million. This estimate does not include several sewerage and drainage studies in Gaza and West
Bank which are being proposed by UNDP and UNRWA with an estimated cost of at least US$1.3 million.
Three TA activities are planned to begin in the period through June 1994. In addition, TA is to be
provided under ERP to cover the cost of preparation and supervision implementation of municipality-
managed water and urban road projects.
5.    Inter-Urban Roads and Transportation. The most urgent task is to begin preparation of a short-
term road rehabilitation program for investment in 1994. Technical assistance is also provided to establish
a Road Project Implementation Unit (RPIU) to manage final preparation and implementation of an
emergency program of inter-urban road maintenance and rehabilitation to be financed under ERP. The
RPIU would be established, under contract to the Palestine Economic Council for Development and
Reconstruction (PECDAR) and would be linked initially to the Gaza CA. This unit would also identify
priorities and design a program for the systematic rehabilitation of the main road network, based on an
assessment of long-term transport requirements, and design a village access road program. This unit is
expected to evolve gradually into a highway authority or road administration for the OT. Technical
assistance would also be made available to carry out traffic management studies for the four most
congested urban centers in the West Bank and Gaza and, once bilateral negotiations reach a mutually
satisfactory point, feasibility studies of major medium- to long-term transport projects considered as high
priority by local planners. The activities of the RPIU are expected to cost about US$3.5 million over three
years and would be financed as part of ERP. The other priority TA activities for the sector are also
expected to cost US$3.5 million. One TA activity is planned to begin in the period through June 1994.
6.    Urban Roads and Mumdipal Development. The EAP provides an opportunity to reactivate
municipal services and harness the potential of existing municipal management and service units to
commence a planned program of maintenance and rehabilitation of urban infrastructure. The municipalities
require a combination of short- and long-ter1n assistance to help them cope with the sudden burst of
contracts they must manage. In the short term, training will not quickly replace the shortage of skilled
technical staff capable of preparing and implementing the volume of works envisioned. To bridge this gap
during the next three years and complement the work of the RPIU mentioned in the previous paragraph,
the TA Program would provide funds to enable municipalities to engage up to 200 man-months of short-
term consultants to help them review, plan and design projects; carry out feasibility studies; or otherwise
complete the preparation of the many projects of deferred maintenance and rehabilitation works proposed
by the 29 municipalities in the West Bank and Gaza. The cost of this assistance is estimated at
US$450,000. One TA activity is planned to begin in the period through June 1994.
7.    Environment. Successful economic recovery requires the effective integration of environmental
issues in economic management. In order to achieve this objective the Palestinian Environmental
Protection Authority (PEPA) was established in January 1994 to provide an institutional structure for
environmental management. Data are generally lacking, but experienced Palestinians are not. Serious
environmental problems exist in agriculture, water, wastewater and solid waste; environmental conditions
in Gaza appear to be the worst in the Middle East. The strategy would be to focus efforts over the next
three years on the establishment of administrative frameworks and practical plans to manage the
environment; support environmental education and public awareness programs; and prepare an



39
environmental action plan and monitoring framework, and a ground water management and monitoring
system for Gaza. The estimated cost of these activities is US$2.6 million over the next three years,
excluding an estimated US$4.0 million in equipment and technical assistance to implement the Gaza
groundwater monitoring plan and environmental standards, monitoring and other facilities. It also excludes
US$0.9 million of other activities which donors have already agreed to finance on a bilateral basis. These
estimates assume that a significant amount of the work would be undertaken by Palestinian institutions and
experts working on a collaborative basis with foreign specialists as required. A TA activity for preparation
of environmental assessment procedures is planned to begin in the period through June 1994.

APPENDIX 3
SECTOR BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY
I     The ERP comprises, inter alia, priority interventions in three infrastructural sectors: education;
water, wastewater and sanitation; and roads. A brief description of each of these sectors including issues
and proposed strategies is presented here. The accompanying matrices summarize key issues and
strategies.'
Education
2.    Background. Education is provided to Palestinians by the private sector, UNRWA, and the Civil
Administration. The Civil Administration dominates primary and secondary education, enrolling about
60 percent of all students. UNRWA educates about a quarter of all students at these levels. The
remaining 13 percent of students attend private schools. Nearly all secondary schools are operated by
the Civil Administation; they enroll about 40 percent of the age-relevant cohort. Secondary-level
vocational schools train a very small fraction of age-eligible students - only about 2.6 percent in recent
years. Most preschools and universities are operated by private, voluntary organizations; the preschools
enroll 20-30 percent of the relevant age group. The higher education system consists of 8 universities
(two in Gaza and 6 in the West Bank) with a total enrollment of 20,484 students. The twenty community
and technical colleges (4 in Gaza and 16 on the West Bank) together have 7,364 students.
3.    In general, the system of education has been designed to transmit knowledge rather than to
develop capacities for critical thinking and skills in solving complex problems; fails to provide sufficient
access to female students, particularly at the secondary level; is deficient in curricula, teaching methods
and modem educational inputs-particularly library books, laboratory equipment and computer facilities;
is plagued by overcrowding-a problem that is particularly acute in UNRWA schools; has been subjected
to frequent and prolonged interruption of instruction because of the Intifada and has denied a generation
of students a sound education; has failed to impart high priority technical and professional skills. General
academic education has been over-expanded relative to vocational relevant instruction-roughly two-thirds
of university students are enrolled in programs in the humanities, the social sciences other than
economics, and education while labor market data indicate an under-investment in high quality vocational
and technical trainig in particular occupations.
4.    Issues and Strategy. The key issues are: preserving the private preschool and university systems
during the current funding crisis-one due to the sharp drop in foreign assistance to the education system
in recent years; improving the quality of the formal education system; establishing a Palestinian authority
with responsibility for integrating and developing the education system; increasing investment in
vocational and techmical education in order to reduce the scarcity of key technical skills and more closely
match supply to demand; improving the currently low educational outcomes, particularly of children
whose education has been interrupted by events during the Intifada.
S.    The short-term strategy is to: a) sustain the current system by allocating resources to meet the
immediate recurrent expenses of the preschool and university systems; by undertaking a careful
assessment of the curren financial condition of education institutions; by formulating a financial plan for

42
each; and by developing skills in the financial management of education institutions-particularly
universities and colleges; b) begin a multi-pronged attack on quality by increasing the availability and
improving the quality of books, teaching materials and equipment; upgrading physical plant, facilities and
equipment; reducing overcrowding by building additional classrooms, laboratories and gymnasia;
improving curricula; raising the standards of the exit examinations; and improving teacher training and
performance standards; c) strengthen vocational education and improve the link between vocational
training and employment through such mechanisms as tracer studies of graduates, studies to identify the
demand for skills, and curricula improvement; d) prepare for the transfer of authority over education
from the Civil Administration by creating a Palestinian institutional framework capable of developing
education policy and integrating operational systems and procedures-including developing minimum
teacher qualifications and reviewing salaries, fringe benefits and administrative costs; e) devise remedial
education programs for the children negatively affected by the intifada; and f) strengthen the links
between schools and communities in order to increase public involvement in the education process and
help re-knit communities-especially those negatively affected by the intifada-by encouraging the use of
school facilities as centers of commnunity activity. The long-term strategy is to: a) introduce cost-cutting
measures, increase student fees, diversify funding sources; b) revise the curricular framework, prepare
or purchase new texts and teaching materials, revise and upgrade teacher training and update the exit
examinations; c) merge the educational systems now operated by the CA and UNRWA; d) develop a
market-responsive vocational and higher education system by establishing closer links between employers
and schools, and establishing mechanisms for the rapid design and introduction of new training activities;
e) develop a remedial education program for those who have suffered significant deficits due to the
intifada; and f) replace obsolete and inadequate schools.

6.    Background. Wbile almost all households in the OT have access to power,2  consumption
(estimated at about 679 kWh per capita) is low in comparison to other countries at similar levels of
income (for example: Egypt at 815, Jordan at 1054, Tunisia at 615 and Syria at 699 kWh per capita).
If political and economic conditions improve, demand could grow by 10% to 15% per year through the
end of the decade.
7.    Except for the diesel electric capacity operated by the Nablus municipality, the Israeli Electric
Company (IEC) supplies all of the OT, including the Israeli settlements. However, responsibility for
distribution is divided between some 114 municipal undertakings-17 in Gaza and 97 in the West Bank,
serving respectively between 400 and 33,000, and 400 and 92,0003 consumers each-operated mainly as
municipal departments. With the exception of the Jerusalem Elecric Company and perhaps one or two
others, these municipal undertakings are too small to be efficient. They lack suitably qualified staff; have
inadequate billing, collection, accounting and data processing systems; have tariffs which, after deducting
operating expenses, are insufficient to cover even the cost of electricity purchases from IEC; and are
incapable of preserving existing investments, much less efficiently planning or managing large scale
programs of development.
a/ At the end of 1990 only about 7.0% of the OT population did not have access to electricity. Another 71
communities (population of 221,000) received limited service (6-12 hours/day) from a number of relaively
small diesel geeration units.
I/ The Jesalem Electric Company (JEDCO).

8.    In the Gaza Strip the total load drawn by the 79,000 consumers is about 80,000 kVA. Bulk
power is supplied from 3 transformer stations located in Israel. Feeders emanating from these stations
are limited in capacity and are equipped with load limiting circuit breakers located inside Gaza. These
feeders supply some 196 municipally-owned distribution transformers. Demand exceeds transformer
capacity, and overloading at times of peak loads is evidenced by the high burn-out rate of some 15
transformers per year. In the West Bank bulk power is supplied from 5 IEC 161\33 kV transformer
stations located outside the main cities of Jerusalem, Hebron and Nablus and by a 13.5 MW medium-
speed diesel station, running on heavy fuel, located in the city of Nablus. Sixteen main 33 kV IEC
transmission lines (some of which are dedicated to Israeli settlements) and a low voltage network cover
almost the entire geographical area. As in Gaza, distribution feeders emanating from the IEC substations
are equipped with load limiting devices.
9.    The distribution network, in general, has been neglected. In Gaza, at least 100 km of the existing
400 km of low voltage lines are in poor condition due to lack of maintenance, overloading, and aging
(20 or more years old), and need to be rebuilt. System technical losses are in the range of 17% to 20%
due to the long low voltage lines and overloading of transformers. Such loss levels are about three times
the norm for comparable well-run systems. In addition, non-technical losses (theft of electricity) may be
as high as 35 % of input electricity in some areas. These abnormally high levels of illegal connections are
a result of weak capacity to collect electricity billings, but also have political foundations.' In the West
Bank at least 380 km of the existing 2300 km of low voltage lines are in poor condition and also need
to be rebuilt. In addition, some 100 kmn of obsolescent 6.6 kV distribution circuits also need to be
upgraded.
10.   Generating capacity is adequate but, as noted above, is almost wholly Israeli owned and
controlled. IEC's bulk power supplies fully dedicated to the Occupied Territories (including the Israeli
settlements) is stated at approximately 420 MVA. I The 1993 coincident peak for the OT, including
supply of the Israeli settlements, was 290 MW. IEC's near-term (1993-1998) plans to meet the
approximately 50% forecasted growth in demand in the OT during in this period envisages an investment
of about US$140 million. This sum excludes investment at the generation level, but includes programmned
expansion of the high voltage transmission and step-down transfonner capacity and the 33 kV sub-
transmission network. IEC's investment program is currently "on hold" pending the resolution of the
future electricity supply arrangements in the OT. It involves relatively long lead-time construction with
siting and environmental issues. Without a re-oriented investment program in bulk transmission in the
near future, supplies to the OT may become constrained and unreliable near the end of the decade. On
the Palestinian side, plans also exist for: the construction of a 10 MW medium-speed diesel plant (2 x
SMW) in Jericho estimated at US$ 12.0 million (bilateral funding is being negotiated); and a rural
electrification program involving supply to 115 villages in the northern and southern regions at an
estimated cost approximately US$10.0 million.
11.   Issues and Strategy. The key sector issues are: improving service to consumers by reducing
network overload and the consequent damage to consumer equipment due to low voltages and frequent
outages; improving sector efficiency through improved training and operating systems and practices, and
through consolidating existing fragmented utilities into larger units to take advantage of economies of
scale; and reducing dependence on Israel for bulk supplies.
4/ As part of the protest against the occupation, at least since the Intifada.
S/ Others, not fully dedicated transmission facilities are located within Israel.

Roads: (a) Inter-Urban Roads and Transport'
19.   Background: The inter-urban transport system of the OT consists of 2000 km of road network
in the West Bank and 168 km in the Gaza Strip. Except for sections serving Israeli settlers, the network
is generally in poor condition. Since 1967, there has only been limited extension to the paved road
network, and the ratio of road length to population is lower than any country in the region, except Egypt.
Congestion is particularly severe on the Gaza inter-urban network, and on the Ramallah/Al
Birah/Jerusalem/Hebron corridor.
20.   The main network serving the major population centers--largely constructed before 1967--is about
700 km in total length. On the West Bank, it consists of two main north-south corridors, but also
includes major east-west corridors. The regional network, about 500 km in total length, is also oriented
to north-south and east-west. The local roads link smaller communities and villages and provides access
to the main and regional road networks. In addition, an 880-km agricultural road network serving West
Bank farming communities requires selective rehabilitation and improvement. In Gaza the main road
system consists of the main north-south road connecting the four larger cities (Gaza, Jaballah, Khan
Younis, and Rafah). It is severely deteriorated but still passable for traffic. There is also a coastal road
that can serve through traffic but it is in need of reconstruction, upgrading and repairs.
21.   The inter-urban road system is under the jurisdiction of the Civil Administration. Here, the
chronic lack of expenditure on maintenance has left key highways serving Palestinian areas in poor
condition, with pavements in some places on the brink of disintegration. Annual expenditure on roads
is not known with any precision. It may be as high as US$15 million per year, but a significant portion
of this is spent on roads leading to Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza or for resurfacing of
main roads in the vicinity of such settlements. Some is also spent on municipal roads, leaving little for
maintenance of the inter-urban road network.
22.    Road Transport is the only mode available for passenger movements in the OT and is completely
in the private sector. It consists of buses; shared taxis; and unlicensed private cars, mini-vans and pick-
ups which provide services mainly in remote areas and densely populated centers as licensed vehicles
cannot adequately meet the demand. Due to the lack of a formal financial sector in the OT, term
financing is not generally available to bus companies, placing a constraint on fleet renewal and proper
maintenance. Also, due to ease of entry and lax regulation, competition from private cars providing
unlicensed passenger services further reduces the revenues of the bus companies and contributes to the
weakening their financial position. All road freight movements are carried out by privately owned
trucking companies, and about 20,000 trucks of various sizes are in operation. Trucking enterprises face
financial problems similar to those facing bus companies. Most of the trucking fleet is old and costly to
operate. ';he industry is not well organized and lacks modern termninal facilities. Delays caused by
security concerns of the Israeli Authorities add to the financial burdens of the trucking enterprises.
6/ The focus here is on road transport. Independent OT ports and airports do not exist, are contentious, are not
included in EAP or the project, and are thus not discussed here. Railways are non-existent, and due to the
small size of the territories are unlikely to play a significant role in the near future. It should be noted,
however, that studies to establish the feasibility of developing port facilities in Gaza and an international
airport at Qualandia near Jerusalem could be considered for study under TAP once the political issues are
settled.



47
23.   Issues and Strategy: The key sector issues are: arresting the deterioration and improving the
quality of the existing inter-urban road network; relieving congestion on key sections of the network,
thereby reducing air pollution, travel time and travel costs; improving accessibility to villages; and
strengthening institutional capacity to plan, manage and rnaintain the network.
24.   The short-tenn strateg is to: (a) develop and begin implementation of a 5-year road stabilization
program to establish regular routine maintenance and to eliminate the backlog of road maintenance; (b)
provide villages with improved road access and expand the current rural roads network where justified;
(c) design and implement traffic management schemes to relieve congestion in key cities; (d) undertake
studies to determine the appropriate structure for planning, managing and regulating transport subsectors
and, on the basis of these, establish the nucleus of a highways administration; (e) develop and launch
training programs to enhance the capacity of (i) local consultants to undertake highway planning and
design, and (ii) contractors to undertake road maintenance and rehabilitation; and (f) undertake studies
to improve the passenger and freight transport system, including developing better linkages between the
West Bank and Gaza. The long-term strategy is to: (a) establish institutions to develop effective sector
policy and planning, and mechanisms to manage and adequately fund preservation of inter-urban road
system assets; (b) implement projects to improve inter-urban passenger and freight transport, including
connections between the West Bank and Gaza; and (c) continue the program to upgrade and extend the
rural road network. Subject to further political agreements with Israel and demonstration of their
technical, economic and environmental feasiblility, the development of the Gaza port and Qualandia
airports would also be core elements of the long-term strategy.
Roads: (b) Municipal Roads and Facilities
25.   Background: Municipalities are generally weak, and have become progressively weaker since
the Intifada. This is due partly to social and economic dislocation, and the lack of representative political
leadership. Municipal elections have not taken place for many years, thus most municipalities: lack a
popular mandate; have had to manage with inadequate funding due to the limitations of the municipal
finance system administered by the CA; and have been unable to effectively collect taxes, fees or user
charges. The consequent shortages of funds and lack of opportunities to recover budget deficits through
taxation and user charges, borrowing, or from the CA, has severely curtailed municipal operations. On
the other hand, it has also limited over-staffing. Despite the unfavorable environment, local governments
have managed to provide a basic level of services. Thus municipal roads and facilities (office and service
buildings, markets, slaughterhouses, recreation areas, etc.) in the OT are often in poor condition-and
conditions are generally far worse in Gaza than they are in the West Bank. These conditions contribute
to environmental degradation, increase urban travel times and costs, and lower the efficiency, health and
safety of the cities.
26.   Planning is also problematic. While regional and city land-use plans have been prepared by the
CA, municipalities and Palestmian professionals, there is no agreed or widely accepted long-term
planning framework for assessing land development and investments in major infrastructure and facilities.
This is most acute in the Gaza strip where several municipalities and refugee camps run by UNRWA
share common borders and facilities, and where there are issues concerning the future disposition of state
land. In addition, land markets are severely distorted, with consequent pressures to expand municipal
boundaries. The latter have been severely constrained by Israeli regulations.
27.   Issues and Strategy: The key issues are: reducing urban transport costs and travel times;
increasing accessibility and safety; improving surface water drainage, thus reducing the incidence of
flooding and flood damage; preserving existing investment in infrastructure and services; improving
municipal facilities and preserving existing municipal assets (markets, slaughter houses, office, recreation



48
facilities, etc.); and strengthening municipal capacity to plan, finance, manage and maintain urban
services and facilities.
28.   The short4erm strategy is to: (a) focus initially, but not exclusively, on improving conditions
in Gaza; (b) develop and implement a coordinaed program to rehabilitate, improve and systematically
maintain existing main and secondary roads and drains; (c) remove major traffic bottlenecks through
better traffic planning, signalization, channelization, road signage and marking; and (d) develop and
implement a coordinated program to rehabilitate, improve and systematically maintain existing municipal
buildins and facilities. In preparation for the future, studies would be undertaken in 4-5 representative
upilot" municipalides. These studies would include: (i) management audits-i.e, audits of existing
insdtutional argements, systems and pracdces (including administrative, personnel, benefits, planning,
budgeting, accountig, cost recovery, taxation, billing, collection, data processing, information, and
infrastructural services maintenance and managent); and (ii) preparation of municipal structure,
investment, development, and institutional restuuring plans; f) prepare regional investment, institutional
and structure plans for Gaza; and g) to the extent possible, involve all important community groups in
the process of demnng  municipal priorities and preparing municipal investment and development
plans. The long-term strategy is to implement a national program of municipal reform and capacity
building, drawing on the lessons learned in the wpilots cities. It also includes establishing a system of
regional planning; preparing and implementing regional investment, structure and municipal development
plans for Gaza; and preparing and beginning to implement similar plans for the West Bank.

APPENDIX 4
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
1.    The project would be implemented over a three-year period beginning July 1, 1994.
Implementation arrangements are outlined below and organizational charts and a responsibility matrix are
included.
Program and Project Responsibility and Policy Guidance'
2.      Overall responsibility for policy-making and guidance would lie with the Board of Governors
of PECDAR. However, responsibility for project formulation, implementation, monitoring and reporting
would lie with the Director of the Program Management and Monitoring Office (PMO) of PECDAR.
In order to avoid the danger of over-centralization and ensure that local needs and priorities are
effectively attended to, the PMO would establish a sub-office in Gaza (the Gaza office). The latter would
be responsible for overseeing development and coordination of the program and project components in
the Gaza Strip would be headed by a Deputy Director.
3.    While the PMO would have overall responsibility, to the extent possible it would rely on existing
institutions and agencies-mainly the municipalities and the successor to the Gaza Civil Administration--to
execute the project. PMO itself would only be directly involved in project implementation where no
other appropriate agency is available, or where projects are large or span municipal jurisdictions. Also,
to the extent practicable, PMO would rely on the services of competent consultants (including managing
and procurement consultants, sector implementation consultants, and a panel of local engineering
consultants), recruited in accordance with IDA guidelines, to assist it in undertaking its tasks. This use
of consultants would help ensure that PMO itself remains a lean and agile entity, capable of responding
effectively to the challenges of managing a complex program in a complex and changing environment.
PMO's Organization and Staffing
4.    Apart from its Director and a Deputy Director of the Gaza office, the PMO itself would be
organized and staffed as follows:2
a) Main Office:
i) Sector Specialists (7 no.-education, health, power and telecoms, water and sanitation,
roads and transport, solid waste, and environment), reporting to the Director: These
would be qualified, experienced (nin. 5-10 years) and reputable individuals, recruited
locally and internationally on a contract basis for the duration of the program/project.
Their roles would be to: assist the Director in ensuring, for each of the program/project
subsectors, that proposals are technically and economically sound and justified; liaise
1/ Since PECDAR and its PMO would play essentially the same roles in both EAP and ERP, and since ERP
would support PECDAR's entire operation for the duration of the project, fine distinctions are not made
here between EAP and ERP arrangements.
a/ See also organograms and responsibility matrix attached.



s5
with and advise the project implementing agencies on subproject identification, selection
and "best practices" in specific sectors; monitor and report on subprojects implementation
to the director, deputy director and the MC; help expedite sub-project preparation and
implementation; help define, draft terms of reference for review, and supervise TA
proposals and projects; and undertake other general tasks essential for successful sector
and project development; and
ii) Procurement Officer (1 no.), reporting to the Director: This would be a qualified,
experienced (min. 10 years) and reputable individual, recruited locally on a contract basis
for the duration of the program/project. He/she would: liaise with the MC and
implementing agencies on all matters involving procurement of goods; help define the
procurement requirements of the project; help draft and review specifications and
contracts; help expedite and ensure delivery of goods to final destination.
b) Gaza Office
Sector specialists (4 no.-education and health, water and sanitation, municipal roads and
drains, and solid waste), reporting to the Director: These would be qualified, experienced
(nin. 5-10 years) and reputable individuals, recruited locally and internationally on a contract
basis for the duration of the program/project. Their role would be similar to those of the
specialists in the main office.
Both offices would be assisted by the managing and procurement consultants (see paras. 5-7 below) and
support staff.
Progr   Ma        ent and Procuremnt Consultants (MC)
5.    To help attain its objectives quickly and effectively, PMO would contract the services of a
reputable, competent, and internationally recruited firm of program management consultants (MC or
managing and procurement consultants) for the duration of the project. The MC would report to the
Director of PMO, and their role would be to assist PMO with the following tasks:
a) overall programming and budgeting-including periodic (at least quarterly) revision and
updating to ensure attainment of program and project objectives;
b) developing, instituting and operating effective manual and computer-based operating
procedures and systems for project management, including, inter alia, project information
systems and systems for critical path analysis;
c) project screening,3 evaluation and recommendation for selection;4
3/ The MC would help PMO operationalize the screening criteria outlined in para. 17 below.
A/ The MC would not have the final say on subproject selection. Having screened projects on the basis of
ageed criteria, MC would recommend selection to the Director of PMO and the Deputy Director, Gaza.
These two, with the advice of the sector specialists would have responsibility for preliminary subproject
selection. This would be subject to the advice of PMO's Director for Economics and Finance and the final
authority of the Deputy Managing Director. The Directors of PMO and Economic Policy would establish a
small (4-5 persons) committee for subproject selection.



56
d) reviewing contract evaluation and award;
e) project, subproject and contract monitoring;
f) reviewing contract claims and payment certification;
g) project and subproject data processing and accounting;5
h) preparation of disbursement requests;
i) ensuring compliance with financial, audit and other program/project covenants;
j) program, project and subproject monitoring and reporting;
k) liaison with implementing agencies on all matters necessary for ensuring the effective
implementtion of the program/project; and
I) bulk procurement of goods, and selective  prou nt ofgoods, works and services required
for effective project implementation.
For the reasons stated above, the MC would also maintain a branch office in Gaza.
6.    In order to undertake its task, the MC would provide a qualified team leader with strong project
finance, management and coordination experience and skilled, and about 6-7 qualified and experienced
specialists in the following areas:
a) prog ngbudgeting (1-2 no.);
b) data processing (1 no.);
c) accounting (1-2 no.);
d) project financial and economic evaluation (1 no.); and
e) civil engineering project management and supervision (1-2 no.).
fI The Accounting Detment of PECDAR would be responsible for all paymes, overal consolidation of
PECDAR's accounts and commissig PECDAR's audit. The MC would be responsible for paymt
cerdfication, project accounts and adits.

APPENDIX 8
PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS
1.    The project elements and their estimated costs, and the procurement arrangements for the
components to be financed by IDA (and jointly with other donors) are summarized in Schedule B of the
MOP. Recurrent and other local costs financed by the Palestinian Economic Council for Development
and Reconstruction (PECDAR) and by other donors are shown under the heading NIF (non-IDA
financed).
2.    The General Procurement Notice would be published in the UN Development Business. Because
of the emergency nature of the project, no further international advertising of the project procurement
would be required.
3.    All equipment and materials, works and services to be financed under the project jointly, or
solely, by IDA would be procured in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for Procurement (May 1992)
with the two exceptions of (a) one-half of the Danish grant would be reserved for procurement of Danish
goods and services, and (b) IDA would administer a Saudi Fund grant in all aspects save for decisions
with respect to procurement which will be made by the Saudi Fund according to its eligibility
requirements (refer para. 8). Occupied Territories (OT) manufacturers competing under International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent of the CIF price
or the prevailing customs duty applicable to non-exempt importers, whichever is less, provided they can
prove that the value added to the product in the Occupied Territories exceeds 20 percent of ex-factory
bid price. OT contractors competing under ICB for civil works contracts would receive a preference in
bid evaluation of 7.5 percent.
4.    Vehicles, equipment and materials required for the project will consist of computer systems and
peripherals, software systems, telecommunications, office and classroom equipment, several laboratory
equipment, books, training aids and related supplies, vehicles for project management and supervision
and tools equipment and spares for project sub-components. Contracts for equipment and materials
estimated to cost more than US$250,000 equivalent each will be procured through ICB, using IDA's
Standard Bidding Documents modified to suit the requirements of individual project packages. Contracts
for office and classroom equipment and supplies, and electrical fixtures are likely to be won by local
suppliers. International shopping (IS) with at least three quotations from three eligible countries will be
used for contracts estimated to cost less than US$250,000. Local shopping with at least three quotations
will be used for off-the-shelf items costing less than US$25,000 per package . Direct Contracting (DC)
will be allowed for items of a proprietary nature or items required to ensure compatibility with the
already installed equipment.
5.    Civil works contracts will be packaged taking into account such factors as the nature of the
works, state of preparation and implementation capacity of local contractors and implementing agencies.
Works contracts costing less than US$3 million, with the exception of those requiring special construction
and installation expertise, are not expected to be of interest to foreign contractors because they are many
Z/ Cofinancing from the Kuwait Fund is confirmed. Cofinancing from UAE is probable but has not yet been
confirmed. Similar procedures would be adopted with respect to the administration of these funds (see
para. 14 of MOP).



75
(250-300) relatively small and widely dispersed geographically, with a multitude of implementing
agencies, mainly the municipalities. Therefore, specialized contracts and works contracts costing more
than US$3 million per contract will be procured through ICB using IDA's Standard Bidding Documents
for Civil Works modified to suit the requirements of individual works. All other works contracts will
be awarded under LCB procedures following the implementing agencies' normal procurement procedures.
Very small works, such as street cleaning, trench rehabilitation, etc., will be done using the
municipalities' existing work force. The pre-1967 procurement laws of Egypt (with some elements of
the Palestine Mandate Law and Israeli Civil Administration regulations) and Jordan are in force in Gaza
and the West Bank, respectively. The procurement procedures described by these laws are being
followed by the municipalities and local administrative units. These are satisfactory to IDA with the
following provisos: (i) tenders will be advertised for at least two consecutive days in a local newspaper
of wide circulation; (ii) prospe_tive bidders will be allowed a minimum of 30 days between the first
appearance of notification and bid submission; (iii) bidding documents will follow the formats of IDA's
Standard Bidding Documents or those used by UNRWA or UNDP in OT; (iv) if interested, foreign
bidders will be allowed to submit bids, and will not be required to have local agents to be able to
participate in bidding; (v) bids will be submitted in sealed envelopes, and both mailed and handcarried
bids will be accepted; (vi) all bids will be'opened at the same time in public; (vii) contracts will be
awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder; (viii) bidders will not be asked, nor allowed, to change the
substance of their bids after the bid closing date, and price negotiations with the lowest evaluated bidder
will be confined to those cases listed in IDA's Procurement Guidelines; and (ix) in the absence of
prequalification, postqualification criteria will be explicitly stated in the bidding documents.
6.    Consultancy assignments will involve both individual consultants and consulting firms, mostly
those hired to support the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction Agency
(PECDAR) or municipalities. The selection of consultants will be in accordance with the Guidelines for
the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August
1981), using IDA's standardized Letter of Invitation (LOI) and Sample Form of Contract for Consultants'
Services [or the standard form of contract used when IDA is the Executing Agency]. There will be a
total of about 30-40 assignments. Major assignments will be for managing and procurement consultants,
inter-city roads implementation consultants, preparation of first year core projects in water and municipal
roads sectors, preparation of an immediate road rehabilitation program, and numerous consultancy
assigments directly with municipal governments (and other implementing agencies) to prepare second
and third year projects. Training services will be obtained mostly through consulting organizations
associated with the project or through specialized UN agencies, such as ILO. There are several local
consultants with the requisite experience and background. Therefore, their expected participation in the
project assignments is expected to be high.
7.    Due to PECDAR's recent establishment and the project implementing agencies' lack of
international procuremnent experience, the knowledge in international commercial practices and IDA's
piocurement procedures is almost non-existent. Therefore, all procurement activities under the project
will be coordinated by PECDAR, which will establish a Procurement Unit responsible for (i) coordinating
and monitoring all procurement activities of the implementing agencies; (ii) taking actions required by
the Grant Agreement's prior or post review provisions; (iii) conducting all ICB and Technical Assistance
related procurement; (iv) maintaining the records required for accountability in the use of grant funds.
In these endeavors PECDAR's Procurement Unit will be assisted by procurement consultants satisfactory
to IDA. To ensure compliance with IDA's procurement guidelines, all contracts awarded through ICB,
as well as all civil works contracts above US$250,000 and all consultant appointments above
US$100,000, and the first two contracts of each implementing agency will be subject to prior IDA
review. These limits would result in prior review of a sufficiently large number of contracts to ensure



76
that IDA's Procurement Guidelines are followed. All other contracts will be subject to selective ex-post
review by IDA.
8.    The procedure for procurement of goods and services financed by the Saudi Fund grant would
be essentially as follows: (i) the MC and PECDAR will define parallel procurement procedures in
accordance with the Saudi Fund requirements and inform IDA; (ii) IDA will review all engineering,
implementation and cost studies and agree contract packages with PECDAR/MC (excluding actual bid
packages); (iii) IDA and PECDARtMC consult with the Saudi Fund and agree packages for Saudi Fund
financing; (iv) PECDAR/MC undertakes all procurement steps in accordance with the defined procedures
and informs the Saudi Fund and IDA of bid evaluation results and reconmmendations for award of
contracts; (v) the Saudi Fund approves or otherwise and informs PECDAR and IDA; and (vi) PECDAR
submits withdrawal requests to IDA only with respect to contracts cleared by the Saudi Fund for tinancing
from its resources.

APPENDIX 9
OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
EMERGENCY REHABILITATION PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
I. APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEDURES AND REVIEW PROCESS
1.    Introduction. An IDA environmental team participated in the IDA mission to the Occupied
Territories from October 16 to November 5, 1993. The objectives of the mission, which were undertaken
in cooperation with Palestinian counterparts, were: (a) to prepare a proposed environmental element for
the Emergency Assistance Program; (b) to review environmental aspects of activities included in the
proposed Emergency Recovery Project; and (c) to develop a proposed environmental element for the
proposed Technical Assistance Program. During this period they conducted a series of site visits,
institutional visits, and conducted an extensive series of meetings with parties concerned with
environmental management issues in the Occupied Territories. The work of the environmental team was
complemented by a water team which reviewed water resources, water supply and wastewater
management, and a solid waste team which reviewed solid, hazardous and toxic waste management issues.
2.    Applicabilit of Environmental Procedures. The following envirornental procedures would
apply to the review and implementation of the proposed project, in addition to those of IDA as outlined
in its Operational Directives and Environmental Assessment Sourcebook: (a) for Gaza, the pre-1967
legislation of the Government of Egypt concerning water quality inspections by health authorities and
provisions for the protection of antiquities and historical monuments; and (b) for the West Bank, the pre-
1967 legislation of the Government of Jordan concerning water quality inspections by health authorities
and provisions for protection of antiquities and historical monuments.
3.    Development of New Procedures. The procedures of Egypt and Jordan would he phased out
of use as enviromnental procedures and guidelines are developed and issued for use by the Interim Self-
Government Authority. The complementary Technical Assistance Program would support development
of an environmental management capacity including development of a Palestinian Environmental
Protection Authority (PEPA) as agreed to in the Declaration of Principles. This process would include
assistance for establishment of environmental management units, environmental standards and
environmenWal assessment procedures. The Program would also support the development of procedures
for management of archaeological, historical and vemacular architectural values.
4.    Environmental Screening Category. The activities to be supported under the proposed project
have been reviewed with regard to the provisions of applicable Egyptian legislation, Jordanian legislation
and IDA, Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmnental Assessment." The activities to he includeA in the
proposed project have been placed in environmental screening category "B" due to their limited scope
and the restricted nature of their potential impacts. It should be noted that feasibility studies for
subprojects to be included in the ERP, will include the preparation of environmental reviews and
environmental assessments consistent with IDA guidelines.

9.    Wastewater Collection Interventions. Rehabilitation and expansion of the wastewater collection
networks would improve collection and conveyance of wastewater. Improved and regular collection of
sewage from vaults in larger buildings and homes in unsewered areas would improve the degree of
treatment of wastes presently leaching into the ground. Both these interventions would reduce the
periodic flooding of streets with untreated wastewater and reduce public health risks resulting from
contact with these materials. Actions to reduce water use would in most locations result in a reduced
volume of wastewater being discharged. However, on an interim basis in some locations, the discharges
of wastewater to surface drainage could increase as the result of expanded collection networks and more
frequent pumping of vaults. This would be offset by reductions in the present direct discharges to the
groundwater table from vaults, abandoned cesspits and leakage from poorly maintained collection
systems.  Establishment of facilities for wastewater testing would allow for the more accurate
characterization of wastewaters which would be especially important in the long-term given their potential
for reuse.                                                              I
10.   Wastewater Treatment and Reuse Studies. The proposed support program would also include
review of existing and proposed investments in new and/or expanded wastewater treatment facilities. For
this purpose specialized consultants would be retained to review existing and proposed wastewater
treatment facilities concerning their design standards, reliability of operation under local conditions and
possibilities for reuse of treated wastewater for groundwater recharge, irrigated agriculture and other
beneficial uses. They would be responsible for the preparation of modified or new process designs which
would include provisions for sludge treatment and monitoring of wastewater from the plants and within
reuse schemes. These interventions would be implemented as priority steps to address control of
pollution now resulting from the discharge of partially treated and/or untreated wastewaters to surface
discharge points such as seasonally wet river beds ("wadis"). The consultants would also develop, on
a collaborative basis, a coherent strategy for wastewater treatment which recognizes properly treated
wastewater as a potential resource rather than as a waste product for disposal.
11.   Environmental Review of Proposed Wastewater Treatment and Reuse Activities. Provisions
have been made in the terms of reference for the consultants to include the preparation of environmental
reviews, as required by IDA, Operational Directive, 4.01, "Environmental Assessment." The reviews
would address environmental concerns in an integrated manner as a key element of treatment technology
evaluation, site selection, plant design, system operation and monitoring. Environmental reviews would
be prepared with reference to the guidance provided in the IDA Environmental Assessment Sourcebook,
Volume II, "Wastewater Collection, Treatment, Reuse and Disposal Systems," pages 231-244.
Contractors would be briefed concerning measures to be taken should they have "chance fmds" of
archaeological or historical materials.
B.    Programs with Minor Environmental Issues
Educational Facilities Upgrading Programs
12.   The proposed programs would address environmental issues through the use of standard design
practices and guidelines which would include provisions for the supply of water, safe disposal of
wastewaters, and collection of solid waste. Educational facility wastewaters would be collected and
discharged to rehabilitated vaults and/or municipal wastewater collection systems. Provisions would be
made for the routine collection and disposal of solid wastes.



80
Power Sector Prom
13. The investment portion of the first phase of the power sector program is largely restricted to thc
rehabilitation and upgrading of the exsting power distribution system. This would be anticipated to have
minor environmental impact provided good design, safety and supervision praices are implemented and
routinely monitored. An environmental review would be prepared as part of the design process for the
proposed 20 km extension of 22-kV lines. Other concerns to be addressed include the proper disposal
of waste materials associated with rehabilitation activities and use of guidelines to avoid the installation
of high voltage power lines over settlements or individual houses. Future power sector projects, proposed
for support in later stages of the program, would be evaluated by pre-feasibility and feasibility studies
supported by the complementary Technical Assistance Program. These studies would include the
preparation of environmental reviews and environmental assessments consistent with the potential impacts
of the proposed project. General guidance for these studies would be provided from various chapters of
Volume m of the IDA Environmental Assessment Sourcebook.
Inter-Urban Roads and TraIsport
14.   Proposed activities would focus on rehabilitation of the existing road network which is in serious
disrepair. Potential direct environmental impacts would be limited to the proper disposal of construction
wastes from road repair and resurfacing operations. Measures would be required to ensure that the
proper disposal of these materials is monitored as an element of project supervision. Contractors would
be briefed concerning measures to be taken should they have "chance finds" of archaeological or
historical materials. Environmental issues and concerns with regard to archaeological and historical sites
would be addressed in a training program proposed under the Technical Assistance Program for local
road contractors and consultants.
15.   Future transportation sector projects proposed for potential support in later stages of the program
would be evaluated by pre-feasibility and feasibility studies supported by the complementary Technical
Assistance Program. These studies would include the preparation of environmental reviews and
environmental assessments consistent with the potential impacts of the proposed project. General
guidance for these studies would be provided from various chapters of Volume II of the IDA
Environmental Assessment Sourcebook.
Municipal Roads and Facllities
16.   The proposed program would support the rehabilitation of roads within municipalities. It would
also support rebabilitation of existing service facilities and a limited amount of construction of new
service facilities to include garages, workshops, service yards, fire houses, slaughterhouses, markets, etc.
The road rehabilitation program would be anticipated to have minor environmental impact provided good
design, safety and supervision practices are implemented. Provisions would be made in the design of
garages and workshops for the collection of oil and lubricants and of solid waste. Environmental review
would be required for slaughter houses and markets which would include evaluation of their locaton,
access routes, storage areas and liquid and solid waste management facilities. Contractors would be
briefed concerning measures to be taken should they have "chance finds' of archaeological or historical
materials.



81
C.    Special Issue - Construction Materials Industry
17.   Implementation of the proposed project would require the extensive use of locally prepared
construction materials. In particular, inadequately supervised sand and gravel operations could result in
locally significant air pollution from dust, water pollution from improper disposal of lubricants from
heavy equipment, and localized flooding during storms due to the transport of poorly controlled sediment
