1. Executive Summary
0.1   Introduction
Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID) one of the largest electrical
power transmission networks in India is working towards achieving its mission of
"Establishment and Operation of Regional and National Power Grids to facilitate transfer
of power within and across the regions with reliability, security and economy, on sound
commercial principles". As the acquisition of lands and structures for improvements in
power sector such as construction of sub- stations which some times cause economic
and cultural disruption to the affected people from areas where they live and work.
POWERGRID in recogrlition of this, for its projects has incorporated the preparation of
the Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP) and its implementation and made it an integral part
of the Social Assessment process described in its Environmental and Social Policy
Procedures (ESPP). The present report deals with the socio-economic
condition of people affected by land acquisition for the construction of
400/220 Kv Solapur Sub-station in Maharashtra State under its Western Region
System Strengthening -Il (WRSS-II) and plan for their Rehabilitation based on
the out come of social assessment carried out by an independent agency
M/s Centre for Management and Social Research (CMSR), Hyderabad.
0.2   Project Description: WRSS-11
As part of the strengthening of the Regional Grid and to support the generating capacity
of addition programme of about 1,00,000 MW during the 10th and 11th plan a perspective
plan has been evolved in the form of Western Region Systems Strengthening Scheme-lI
(WRSS-11). The proposed system strengthening scheme shall facilitate smooth delivery of
about 4000 MW of power imported from other Regions mainly from eastern Region to the
various load centers and absorption of this power within the region. In view of the above
the various schemes of WRSS-11 have been taken up in four sets. As part of the Set -B of
Regional Strengthening in Southern Maharashtra the construction of a new 400/220
Kv Substation at Limbi-Chincholi in Solapur district of Maharashtra State is proposed.
0.3   Project Area
The location for the construction of the Solapur sub-station is in Limbi-chincholi
Grampanchayat Village, under South Solapur Taluq which falls in the Solapur district of
Maharashtra. The proposed site is situated on the Solapur - Akkalkot State Highway No.
151 and is about 22 Kms. East of Solapur. In absence of government land a private land
measuring 16.11 ha was selected for acquisition for proposed sub-station. The land
acquired is totally owned by the private people. This site was preferred to others as it was
falling away from the eco-sensitive zone.
0.4   Status of Land Acquisition
POWERGRID strictly follows the procedures laid down under the National Law for
acquisition of private properties i.e the Land Acquisition Act (LA Act, 1894, when land is
acquired for sub-stations. The process of land acquisition for the proposed substation
was started by Section-4 notification in April, 2006 followed by Section -6 notification on
27-04-2006. After the joint measurement and marking of the land under section 7 and 8
the Section-9 notification along with individual notices to interested persons were issued.

Inspection/spot verification by Land Acquisition Officer was completed in was issued in
April/May, 2006 for fixing the rate of compensation. Final award through Section-1 I by
Land Acquisition Officer was issued in May, 2006.
0.5   Project Impacts and Social Assessment
As per the Government Notification, the cumulative adverse impacts associated with the
land acquisition of 16.11 ha in the village of Limbi-Chincholi will result in affecting about
22 titleholders/PAPs who are the owners of the land proposed for acquisition. These 22
Project Affected Persons (PAPs) is inclusive of about 13 of them who represent two joint
accounts (6 under one account and 7 under another). However from the 22 titleholders as
one of them is dead (from joint account) and one of them lives with her son (from joint
account) and one of them is unmarried and lives with his father the effective number of
households affected is 19 households. The Table 0.1 below gives the summary of the
impact on the affected persons.

The total affected population is 129 and the average size of the affected households is
around 6.7 persons per household. Among the affected population a majority (60%) of
them are found to be adults who are 18 years and above. Social Group wise a majority
(79%) represent the General castes. Of the total population above 5 years of age around
85 percent of them are literate.
Occupation wise a majority are into informal private services such as lorry/auto drivers,
workers in private business establishment etc. Agriculture as an occupation is for about
29 percent of people. A considerable number of them are into Shop keeping and
Government Services. The income levels suggest a majority coming under middle income
category of 40,000 to 60,000 rupees per annum.
With regard to the landholding among the affected households it was observed that out of
21 PAPs 2 of them are becoming land less after the acquisition and a majority of them
before and after acquisition represent marginal farmers holding up to 1 hectare.

0.6   POWERGRID's Resettlement Principles & Social Policy Framework
POWERGRID has articulated a "Social Entitlement Framework" based on National Policy
on R&R and other progressive trends in its corporate policy "Environment and Social
Policy Procedures" (ESPP) applicable for the affected families and agreed Entitlement
Matrix with funding agencies due to acquisition of land/assets for the substation. Since
the POWERGRID's Social Entitlement Framework is much more comprehensive and
provides better package, the Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP) has been developed
following POWERGRID's Entitlements.
0.7 Action Plan for Rehabilitation of PAPs
The overall objective of the Rehabilitation Action Plan is to ensure that the persons
affected by proposed construction of the Solapur 400/220 kV sub-station will be provided
with suitable entitlements and rehabilitation assistance to improve their living standards.
The prime concern is to rehabilitate and resettle to avoid/minimize hardship to PAPs and
their families through options like Land for Land as far as possible, Rehabilitation
Assistance (RA) and adoption of Income Generating Scheme and training.
Compensation
As the POWERGRID's policy provides compensation at prevailing market
price/replacement value, Special Land Acquisition Officer-l1, Solapur for the project has
finalized the land price with due consideration being given to the type of land, irrigated/un-
irrigated status, the sale statistics in the last five years and the tax collected from the
different categories of land by the revenue authorities. Besides the compensation as per
the finalized rates Solatium @ 30 percent and interest @ of 12% was paid for 33 days is
also paid to all land owners. Compensation for land, trees and construction was
calculated and the compensation was offered to the affected households. The total
compensation offered for the different assets and land for all the affected households is
Rs 8,82,505/- which includes Rs 6,72,725/- offered exclusively for the land lost. The total
land acquired for the sub-station is 16.11 ha therefore the compensation offered for land
is Rs 41,758 per hectare. Apart from this Rs 11463/- has also being paid towards 6
numbers of Neem trees that were coming under the acquired land.
Rehabilitation Assistance
In addition to the compensation measures for the loss of agriculture land and assets the
affected families are assisted with rehabilitation assistance based on the severity of
losses provided in the form of different categories under ESPP. These assistance
amounts are calculated for each affected family according to their eligible category for the
specified number of minimum agricultural wages under Entitlement matrix. However, in all
cases where land compensation is less than RA as per ESPP it has been restricted to
amount the PAPs have received as compensation.
The minimum agricultural wages in Maharashtra are fixed based upon the division of the
State into agro climatic zones. As per the Draft notification no KVR 12006/646/Labour-7
issued on 30t September, 2006 by the Industry, Energy & Labor Department
Government of Maharashtra the project-affected village comes under the Zone-4 for
which the minimum agricultural wage is 66 per day.
Out of the 21 PAPs for 17 of them as the RA amount was exceeding the compensation it
is adjusted to the compensation amount. For the rest 4 PAPs according to their category
*     Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  48



full RA is being proposed. In case of the RA amount is adjusted to the compensation paid
the amounts are distributed among the PAP and his/her eligible PAFs equally. Apart from
this additional assistance calculated for 100/200/375 days is provided to 6 PAPs coming
under vulnerable group like widow, women headed, SC etc. Based on the definition of a
family, as provided in the ESPP the total number of PAFs identified are 35. Of these
around 34 (97.14%) are eligible for assistance. The total rehabilitation assistance amount
is around Rs 6, 66,112 which is about 74.48 percent of the total compensation amount.
0.8   Disclosure and Public Consultations
The consultant Centre for Management and Social Research (CMSR), Hyderabad apart
from carrying out the socio economic survey, many small group meetings and public
meetings were organized time to time. for the affected people have also conducted group
and village level meetings with various stakeholders namely village panchayat members,
affected persons, development officers, and informed the affected people of area about
the project and its resultant benefit along with POWERGRID's R&R policy and other
community development programme which will be launched during the implementation of
the project. The POWERGRID has also undertaken information campaign on the project
details, resettlement policy.

Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID) is one of the largest
electrical power transmission networks in India and carries out real time
supervision and monitoring of power flow on round the clock basis, over the entire
High Voltage Lines network of the country. It is working towards achieving its
mission of "Establishment and Operation of Regional and National Power Grids to
facilitate transfer of power within and across the regions with reliability, security
and economy, on sound commercial principles". The studies show that
construction and improvements in infrastructure projects including power projects
is not purely a technical issue but has wider socio economic implications in the
over all development of the economy. However, acquisition of lands from people
necessitated by improvements in power sector such as construction of sub-
stations may result in the involuntary displacement of the people from areas
where they live and work. Such a change may lead to economic and cultural
disruption to the affected people. Thus to address these issues a Rehabilitation
Action Plan (RAP) is essential for the project affected persons to offset the trauma
and to develop and implement programmers which are meaningful and workable
such that the affected persons will not become worse off economically than
before.
POWERGRID in recognition of this, for its projects has incorporated the
preparation of the Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP) and its implementation and
made it an integral part of the Social Assessment process described in its
Environmental and Social Policy-Procedures (ESPP). The need for the RAP had
been identified by the initial assessment and the analysis of expected social
impacts which require appropriate mitigate measures for all PAPs who, on the
basis of an established cut-off-date, will be losing land or other assets or
livelihood, as a result of project implementation. In this context POWERGRID had
invited and awarded M/s Centre for Management and Social Research (CMSR),
Hyderabad for undertaking a verification and socio-economic survey to obtain
accurate information on the Socio-economic profile of PAPs/PAFs to prepare the
Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP) for the proposed 400/220 Kv Solapur Sub-station
under its Western Region System Strengthening -Il (WRSS-11). The present
report deals with the socio-economic condition of people who will be
affected by land acquisition for the construction of 400/220 Kv sub-station at
Solapur in the Solapur district of Maharashtra State.
1.1   Project Description
India's Transmission and Distribution system comprises a 400kV network as the
main and bulk transmission system in each region; 132kV and 110kV network as
the main and support transmission systems in each state; a 66kV, 33kV and 22kV
network as sub-transmission system; a 11kV network as primary distribution

system; and a 400 volts (three phase) and 230 volts network as local distribution
systems. Even though the Transmission and Distribution network expanded by
about 6.3 percent per annum during the 1980s its, growth has not kept pace with
the capacity to supply power. Frequent power cuts, unscheduled shut downs and
severe restrictions on industrial usage during summer months are a constraint on
industrial development and overall economic development of the country. In this
context, POWERGRD is involved in along term plan for the development of an
Indian National Transmission Network to make efficient usage of generating
capacity. As part of this strengthening of the national grid, POWERGRID had
developed series of High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) inter regional links
between North, East, South and Western Regions of India's power system.
1.1.1 Western Region System Strengthening - II
As part of the strengthening of the Regional Grid and to support the generating
capacity of addition programme of about 1,00,000 MW during the lot and 11t
plan a perspective plan has been evolved in the form of Western Region Systems
Strengthening Scheme-Il (WRSS-II). The proposed transmission strengthening
scheme shall facilitate smooth delivery of about 4000 MW of power imported from
other Regions mainly from eastern Region to the various load centers and
absorption of this power within the region. In addition this will also strengthen the
transmission corridor both in northern part of Western Region as well as to
transfer power from Seoni towards the load centers mostly located in southern
part of Maharashtra. Further it will also strengthen northern part of Gujarat for
absorption of import from Northern Region.
In view of the above the various schemes of WRSS-11 have been taken up in four
sets. The major components of the various sets of the scheme include
construction of new sub-stations, extension of already existing sub-stations and
laying of new transmission lines. The proposed physical activities under each set
under the scheme are presented in the Table 1.1.

The proposed substation is covered under Set-B details of which are as follows:
Set-B: For regional strengthening in Southern Maharashtra
For dispersal of power beyond Parli (POWERGRID) towards southern part of
Maharashtra, two separate 400kV transmission corridor beyond Parli
(POWERGRID) are proposed, viz., 400kV Parli (POWERGRID) - Pune and
Parli(POWERGRID) - Solapur. Pune, a major load centre in Maharashtra, is
presently being fed through 220kV system, which is inadequate to meet its
present as well as future requirement with reliability. Therefore, a 400kV touch
point at Pune is proposed to be established by LILO of Lonikhand - Kalwa 400kV
line. Further, interconnection of Pune with Aurangabad would complete a
transmission corridor from eastern part of the region to western part.
Solapur is a major load centre in southern part of Maharashtra. Therefore, to meet
the growing demand of southern Maharashtra, a 400kV touch point at Solapur is
proposed. 400kV Parli (POWERGRID) - Solapur line is further proposed to be
extended up to Kolhapur to meet the long-term requirement of this area. Further,
Solapur substation would be located almost near the boundary of Western and
Southern Regions and would, therefore, facilitate in termination of a large number
of transmission lines in future, including West-South inter-regional links.
In this way, a parallel transmission corridor right from central part of the region
towards southern part of Maharashtra would be developed to facilitate long-term
power transfer requirement. The transmission lines under the scheme are being
proposed through private participation. However, substations are covered under
the scope of POWERGRID under funding of World Bank.The WRSS-11 scheme is
scheduled to be commissioned within 48 months from the date of the approval
which has been accorded by the Government of India by 24-07-2006. The
manner of funding for the WRSS-11 is shown in the Table 1.2.

1.2.1 Project District-Solapur
The proposed substation shall be a new substation located at Solapur district in
Maharashtra to be constructed and owned by POWERGRID. Historically Solapur
is known as Textile Capital. It was also known as the Labour city in olden days.
Solapur is transport hub connecting Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra
Pradesh. The national highways 9, 13 and 211 pass through Solapur city.
Geographically Solapur is located between 17.10 to 18.32 degrees north latitude
and 74.42 to 76.15 degrees east longitude. The district is situated on the south
east fringe of Maharashtra State and lies entirely in the Bhima and Seena basins.
Whole of the district is drain either by Bhima river or its tributaries.
The district covers geographical area of 14844.6 sq.kms, which is 4.82% of the
total area of Maharashtra State. Out of the total area of the district 338.8 sq.kms
(2.28%) is Urban area whereas remaining 14505.8 sq.kms. (97.72%) is Rural
area. The administrative setup of Solapur district constitutes 11 Talukas, 11
Panchayat Samities, 1027 Gram Panchyats, 1150 Villages, 1 Municipal
corporation and 9 Municipals councils.
As per census 2001, the population of the district is 38.49 lakh. Of these 68.17
percent constitute rural population and 41.83 percent urban population. Observed
across the gender Males constitute 51.68 percent and female population is 48.32
percent. The sex ratio is about 935 females per 1000 males. The density is 305
persons per square kilometer (Refer Exhibit-2).
1.2.2 Project Village - Limbi-Chincholi
The location for the construction of the Solapur sub-station is in Limbi-chincholi
Grampanchayat Village, under South Solapur Taluq which falls in the Solapur
district of Maharashtra. The proposed site is situated on the Solapur - Akkalkot
State Highway No. 151 and is about 22 Kms. East of Solapur (Refer location
map).
1.2.2.1 Physiography and Socio-demographic profile of affected village
From the consultations at the village it is found that the village is predominantly
inhabited by General Caste (60%) community of Lingayat and also a considerable
number of Muslim population. The rest are represented by the SC (27%) and other
backward castes population. The total number of Households of the village are 487
with a population of 2278. Observed across gender the population evenly distributed
among males and females. The literacy rate for the village population is 74.7%.
The villagers are primarily dependent on agriculture (80%) followed by wage labor
(10%), and services (10%). The Table 1.3 below gives the details of Physiography

The facilities that are available in the village include Panchayat building,
Government primary school, Bus shelter, Health sub-center. The village has
access to a High School near by that is run by private establishment. Primary
Health Center is available at Narsang which is 5 Kms away from the village. For
all the other facilities such as Railway Station, College, Government Hospital,
Police Station, Banks, Patwari head Quarters, Development Block office and

1.3   Land Requirement
Land measuring about 17 to 18 ha. is required for setting of 400/220 kV sub-
station. Accordingly in absence of government land a private land measuring
16.11 ha was selected for acquisition for proposed sub-station. The land is un-
irrigated and plane in'terrain. (Plate-1) The land acquired is totally owned by the
private people. This site was preferred to others as it was falling away from the eco-
sensitive zone as more than 60% of Solapur area has been declared as sanctuary
for conservation of Great Indian Bustard an endangered bird.
1.4   Measures to Avoid or Minimize Social Impacts
It has always been the endeavor of the POWERGRID to minimize resettlement
and rehabilitation by using government land wherever possible for its
infrastructure development. In the absence / non-availability of government land
private land may be selected but to minimize the social impact associated with land
loss, POWERGRID has a well developed process of selection of site for new
substation apart from reducing the extent of land requirement through improvement
in design and other parameters. The site selection process is detailed below:
1.4.1 Site Selection and Analysis of Alternatives
The site for the construction of Solapur Sub-station has been selected by the
POWERGRID after studying the different alternatives keeping in view its principles
of avoidance and minimization of social impacts where the land acquisition has
been limited to bare minimum. On the basis of data collected for the various
parameters a comprehensive analysis for each alternative is carried out by a team
comprising representatives of S/s Engg, T/I Engg and ESMD. Weightage was
given to the various parameters is often site specific and due consideration is
given to infrastructure facility such as access to roads, railheads etc, availability of
corridor for incoming and outgoing lines; soil type; type of land viz Govt, revenue,
private land, agricultural land; social impacts such as number of families getting
affected and cost of compensation and extent of rehabilitation. The following are
the different alternatives considered before finalizing the site for the proposed sub-
station.
Site No. I
*     Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  58



The land is situated in village Chincholi, Taluq South Solapur, District Solapur on
Solapur - Akkalkot State Highway No. 151 and is about 22 Kms. East of Solapur.
The soil strata are expected to be predominantly black cotton and the complete
land is presently privately owned. One 33 KV, one 11KV line, on O/H Telephone
line and one underground BSNL/Reliance OFC passes through site and diversion
of the same will be required.
For construction purpose, power may be drawn from the 33 KV or 11 KV feeders
for immediate requirement. The level of site is generally at road level and land is
fairly leveled -having a slope of about 1-2 meters in the North/West direction.
There is no constraint of line corridors from any direction. Since the site is located
on Solapur - Akkalkot State Highway, no approach road is required to be
constructed for accessing the substation site.
Besides, having good public transportation facilities, a town ship of Bidi Workers is
coming up at about 5 Kms. Distance, which may facilitate daily community
requirements. The ground water availability on this site is better compared to
other site alternatives.
Site No. 2
The land is situated in Tandulwadi & Boramani Villages of Taluq South Solapur,
District Solapur.  This site is having slope in North-East direction and level
difference between two ends of site is of the order of 6-8 meters, for which sub-
station would be required to be constructed in multilevel to optimize site leveling
quantity. The soil strata is a mixed one having rocky/hard morrum/black cotton.
Approach to this site is via a village road connecting to National Highway-9. To
approach this site, a village road of about 500 to 600 meters length is to be
developed which may also involve acquisition of some private land.
The site is close to one spinning mill and one oil mill. Besides, M/s. Kirtimala
(industrialist in that area) has acquired large land for their future development and
pollution to that effect is expected in the vicinity. Due to its close vicinity of
National Highway, some of the builders have purchased surrounding lands for
development purpose, which may pose ROW for line corridors. The ground water
availability is very poor at this site and during summer, there is acute problem of
water availability.
Site No.3
This site is situated along the State Highway-151 in Walsang Village of Taluq
South Solapur, District Solapur, and 25 Kms. from Solapur. This site is having
slope in East/East North direction and level difference between two ends of site
may be of the order of 4-5 meters for which sub-station would be required to be
constructed in multilevel to optimize site leveling quantity. The soil strata is mixed
one having rocky/hard morrum/black cotton and may pose constraint of increased
cost and difficulties in earthen design. This site is close to village Walsang, which
is fast developing village and ROW problem are expected to be more for line
corridors. The ground water availability is also very poor at this site.

With analysis of all the relevant parameters the alternative Site number 1 was
considered and selected. Besides, having good public transportation facilities, a
town ship of Bidi Workers is coming up at about 5 Kms. Distance, which may
facilitate daily community requirements. The ground water availability on this site
is better compared to other site alternatives. This site was also preferred to others
as it was falling away from the eco-sensitive zone. The revenue map of the affected
village showing selected land location for the construction of the sub-station is
given as Map-1.

affected person is presented in the Annexure-3. Possession was handed over to
POWERGRID by the end of May 2006. A copy of the possession certificate is
presented as Annexure-4.
1.6   Social Assessment
In order to assess the basic socio-economic condition of the area and the
resultant impact of land acquisition for Solapur substation on the local population,
a socio-economic survey study was conducted by M/s Centre for Management
and Social Research (CMSR), Hyderabad. The objectives of these socio-
economic investigations are two folds. The first one is to identify, assess and
evaluate the broad socio-economic resource base and socio-economic profile of
the immediate region, ,(I.e village) with an implicit purpose of assessing the
absorption capacity of the immediate local region. This is mainly carried out
through published census data. The second objective is to know and understand
the socio-economic characteristics features if the affected households, as also
their aptitude and preferences for rehabilitation. The study tools of Household
Questionnaire and Focused Group Checklist used is presented in Annexure-5.
The above objective can be summarized as follows:
* To collect base line demographic and socio-economic characteristics of
affected household whose lands are being acquired
* To categorize the project affected persons under different categories for
various benefits and entitlements as per POWERGRID's Social Entitlement
Framework and agreed entitlement matrix with World Bank.
* To assess the peoples reaction towards the project and ascertain their
preference for resettlement and rehabilitation, and
* To suggest an appropriate rehabilitation action plan for improving/restoring
the living standards of affected families.

SECTION-2: SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROFILEOF PAPs
2.0  Introduction
Socio-economic survey and verification of the affected persons were undertaken
to address any such adverse impacts that may emerge during the course of the
project implementation. The socio-economic survey is carried and acts as
baseline information and provides a cut-off point for eligibility to compensation or
assistance for loss of assets.
As per the Government Notification, the cumulative adverse impacts associated
with the land acquisition of 16.11 ha in the village of Limbi-Chincholi will result in
affecting about 22 titleholders/PAPs who are the owners of the land proposed for
acquisition. These 22 PAPs is inclusive of about 13 of them who represent two
joint accounts (6 under one joint account and 7 under another joint account).
However from the 22 titleholders as one of them is dead (from joint account) and
one of them lives with her son (from joint account) and one of them is unmarried
and lives with his father the effective number of households for socio-economic
survey is 19 households. Out of the 19 households 11 of them reside in Limbi-
Chincholi village and 8 of them reside at Solapur town. The following analysis is
presented for these 19 affected households. However as per the definition of
family unit considering adult married sons as separate family under Environmental
and Social Policy Procedures (ESPP) of the POWERGRID the Project Affected
Families (PAFs) is 35. The detailed profile of the affected families is enclosed as
Appendix-I.
2.1   Extent of Impact on the village
It can be seen from the Table 2.1 that about 5.66 percent of the total population in
Limbi-chincholi are affected by the land acquisition. The total number of PAFs
affected is 35. On the whole 129 persons are affected out of the total population of
2278. As the affected number is relatively small, it would be possible to absorb
these people in income generating activities fairly within the village itself. The
percentage of the affected households in the village is about 4.07.

Table 4.6 below gives an in depth understanding of the income from the various
sources for the affected households. It is seen from the table that the most
important source of income is cultivation (41.65%) followed by Govt/private
services (30.35%).

2.9  Average Land Holding; Before and After Acquisition
With regard to the agricultural land holding, the details shown in Table 4.7 indicate
a comparative picture of the land owned by the households before and after the
acquisition of land for the sub-station. With regard to the landholding among the
affected households it was observed that 2 of them are becoming land less
(9.52%) and also a small reduction for the other households in terms of their
holding. However a majority of them before and after acquisition represent
marginal farmers holding up to 1 hectare. The total land owned by the affected
persons was 53.08 ha and after acquisition it is 37 ha with a 30 percent reduction
in the total holding.

2.11 Livestock ownership
The livestock ownership among the affected households are presented in the
Table 4.9 below. It is seen from the table that of the total 19 households only 26%
(5HH) of them have Buffalo, followed by 15.79 percent of them who have Cows
and Bullocks. Only one household is having poultry.

2.11 Indebtedness of the affected households
Another important indicator for the economic status is the indebtedness of the
affected family. Table 4.10 shows that out of the 19 households around 8 (42%)
are found to have outstanding debts. Most of these people have taken the Crop
loans from local Banks and Co-operative societies. Out of the total amount taken
by these households about 85 percent of it is still to be repaid.

The health problems include Type of Problems (TB-1, BP-1, Leprosy-1, Chikungunya-1)
Leprosy, Tuberculosis, Blood Pressure and Chikungunya.
2.13 Summary of the Socio-Economic Survey Findings
The major findings from the socio-economic survey are summarized below. These
factors are given due consideration in the preparation of the rehabilitation action
plan.
* The cumulative adverse impacts associated with the acquisition of 16.11 ha
proposed for Solapur sub-station will result in affecting about 19
households who are the owners of the land proposed for acquisition.
* The total affected population is 129 and the average size of the affected
households is around 6.7 persons per household. Among the affected
population a majority (60%) of them are found to be adults who are 18
years and above.
* Religion wise 17 HH represent Hindu community and 2 of them are
Muslims. Social Group wise a majority (79%) represent the General castes
and rest are other backward castes.
*     Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  70



* Of the total population above 5 years of age around 85 percent of them are
literate. The education levels are moderate for a majority 22.22 percent of
them is High School and an equal number of them have Primary school
education.
* Occupation wise a majority (36.14%) are into informal private services such
as lorry/auto drivers, workers in private business establishment etc.
Agriculture as an occupation is for about 29 percent of people. A
considerable number of them are into Shop keeping (10.53%) and
Government Services both continuing and retired (15.70%). This shows
that most of the population is also dependent on occupations other than
agriculture for their livelihood.
* The income levels of the affected households showed that majority (32%)
(6 HH) are coming under middle income category of 40,000 to 60,000
rupees per annum followed by 26 percent of them who are lower middle
income households earning between 25,000 to 40,000 rupees per annum.
* All of them have own houses mostly semi pucca houses (58%) and are
dependent on LPG (52.63%) for cooking purpose.
* With regard to the landholding among the affected households it was
observed that 2 of them are becoming land less (9.52%) after the
acquisition and a majority of them before and after acquisition represent
marginal farmers holding up to 1 hectare.
* Domestic asset ownership is seen with a majority own LPG Stove
(52.63%), Television (57.89%), electric fan (52.63%), Scooter/Motor bike
(47.37%), Telephone (52.63%), Bicycle (47.37%).
* Out of the 19 households around 8 (42%) are found to have outstanding
debts. Most of these people have taken the Crop loans from local Banks
and Co-operative societies.

SECTION-3: LEGAL REQUIREMENT AND REHABILITATION
AND RESETTLEMENT POLICY/ENTITLEMENTS
3.0  Introduction
Transmission projects generally do not require large area because land below
tower/line is not acquired as per law however; land may be acquired for sub-
stations where the land requirement is minimal. Even for this requirement of land
for the construction of sub-stations POWERGRID as a policy imperative tries to
locate the sub station on a government/waste land as far as possible and in the
absence of such land private land is selected. This section presents the legal
requirements for the land acquisition process and the Resettlement and
Rehabilitation Policy and entitlements for affected families.
3.1   Legal Process of Land Acquisition
POWERGRID strictly follows the procedures laid down under the National Law for
acquisition of private properties i.e the Land Acquisition Act (LA Act, 1894, when
land is acquired for sub-stations. Acquisition under this law is a comprehensive
process and involves issuance of various notification informing affected persons
as well as general public regarding impending acquisition of private land/assets
etc. for public purpose. The LA Act specifies that in all cases of land acquisition,
no award of land can be made by the government authorities unless all
compensation has been paid. POWERGRID follows an activity schedule for land
acquisition. The whole process can be divided in three different phases for better
understanding. The process is presented below.
LAND ACQUISITION PROCESS FOR SUB STATION
STAGE-I:
SECTION-4(1)
. Publication of a preliminary notification by the Govemment that land in a
particular locality is needed or may be needed for a public purpose or for a
*     Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  72



LAND ACQUISITION PROCESS FOR SUB STATION
company.
SECTION-5
* Filing of objections to the Acquisition by persons interested and enquiry by
collector
STAGE-Il:
SECTION-6 (1)
* Declaration of intended acquisition by Govemment
SECTION-7&8
* Collector to take order from the government for land acquisition and land to be
marked out, measured and planned.
STAGE-Ill:
SECTION-9
* Public Notice and individual notices to persons interested to file their claims for
compensation.
SECTION-1 1
* Enquiry into claims & Award by the Collector
SECTION-1 6
* Taking possession of the land by the Collector
SECTION-17: POSSESSION BEFORE AWARD IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
* Under S.17 the Government has been given special powers to acquire land
without making the award. This power can be used only in cases of urgency. If
the Government thinks that it is a case of urgency, it may direct the collector to
take possession of the and even though he has not given his award. The
collector can acquire the land fifteen days after the publication of the notice
under Sec-9(1), but not before.
3.2   Policy of Entitlement
In the absence of unified National Policy on R&R till Feb, 2004 many States and
Organizations have developed their own R&R policies for the benefit of affected
people. However, Ministry of Rural Development, GOI, notified the National
Policy in February2004. It is applicable to all developmental projects where 500
or more families enmass in plain areas or 250 or more families enmass in hilly
areas, are displaced due to a project activity.  It essentially addresses the
rehabilitation of PAFs and provides a broad canvas for an effective consultation
between PAFs and the project authorities. It has also listed R&R measures and
entitlements for different category of PAFs.
The National Policy on R&R is not attracted by the transmission projects, as these
do not involve displacement of such a large numbers of families. However,
POWERGRID has adopted entitlement benefits listed in the National R&R Policy
*     Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  73



in its "Social Entitlement Framework" that is being implemented wherever land
acquisition for substations is undertaken.
POWERGRID emphasizes that physical displacement is not an issue with
transmission projects because land below tower/line is not acquired and only a
small piece of land is required for substations.  However, all affected
persons/families shall be provided compensation and rehabilitation assistance
along with other measures as per POWERGRID's Social Entitlement Framework
which is based on these directives/manuals and National R&R Policy to restore
income/livelihood of all affected persons.
POWERGRID has articulated a "Social Entitlement Framework" based on
National Policy on R&R and other progressive trends in its corporate policy -
ESPP applicable for the affected families and agreed Entitlement Matrix with
funding agencies due to acquisition of land/assets for the substation. Since the
POWERGRID's Social Entitlement Framework is much more comprehensive and
provides better package, the present RAP has been developed following
POWERGRID's Entitlements.
3.3   POWERGRID's Social Entitlement Framework
POWERGRID's prime concern is to rehabilitate and resettle people affected by its
operations. Its endeavor is always to avoid/minimize hardship to PAPs and their
families through options like Land for Land as far as possible, Rehabilitation
Assistance (RA) and adoption of Income Generating Scheme and training instead
of cash because it has been experienced that extending cash compensation does
not fully achieve the objective of rehabilitation. POWERGRID while implementing
the social entitlement framework gives special attention to this fact and exhaust all
options before arriving at cash compensation. Basic categories of issues/impacts
under the entitlement framework of the POWERGRID are:
* Loss of Land
* Loss of Structure
* Loss of source of livelihood/Wage/Occupation
* Loss of access to Common Property Resources (CPR) and facilities
* Loss of standing crops and trees
* Losses during transition of displaced persons/establishments and
* Losses to Host Communities
3.3.1 Loss of Land
This impact primarily affects families' access to space for housing (homestead)
and, agricultural land.
a) Loss of homestead land may impact owners with valid titles, or customary
and usufruct rights. The entitlement options offered to owner will include
compensation finalized by revenue authorities on prevailing market rate. In
addition to that, all PAFs of this category shall be provided with equivalent
area of land subject to maximum 150 sq. m. in rural areas and 75 sq. m. in
*    Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  74



urban areas free of cost. The charges towards registration of such land
shall also be borne by POWERGRID.
b) Loss of agricultural land is the most prevalent impact and may affect
wide range of people ranging from big farmers to marginal farmers. It can
be classified into following two categories:
Persons with valid titles or customary or usufruct rights: The beneficiary will
be the title holder who will be entitled to choose between an alternative land of
equivalent productive potential subject to availability preferably within same
village/panchayat but not exceeding 1 hectare of irrigated or 2 hectare of un-
irrigated land. Registration charges for transfer of this land in the name of affected
family shall also be borne by POWERGRID and cash compensation for the extent
of land against which replacement land is not provided. Alternate land for
allotment to PAFs shall be taken from the State Government or from voluntary
sellers at existing land prices top avoid further impact. Since availability of
sufficient land in the same area may be a limiting factor therefore the land for land
option will be open only to agriculture based PAFs, rendered totally landless by
project activities. If the alternate land is wasteland/degraded land, all eligible PAFs
shall be provided one-time-assistance of Rs. 10,000/- per ha towards
development of land. In case PAFs opt for cash compensation for loss of land or
not eligible for land for land option, they will be provided cash compensation at
replacement cost which will include compensation as fixed by competent
authorities under LA act including solatium and applicable interest plus following
rehabilitation assistance based on the severity of losses:
* 750 days of minimum agricultural wages for families loosing entire land
thus rendered landless. Since these families are losing entire land, which
may adversely affect their livelihood if no other source, is available.
Keeping this in view, these PAFs shall be encouraged to opt for Income
Generating Scheme (IGS) of equivalent amount based on aptitude/skills of
PAFS for maintaining a regular income.
* 500 days of minimum agricultural wages for families loosing part land and
consequently becoming a marginal farmer (< 1 ha. of irrigated land).
* 375 days of minimum agricultural wages for families loosing part land and
consequently becoming a small farmer (> 1 ha. of irrigated land).
* 100-200 days of minimum agricultural wages for big farmers or families
loosing part /negligible amount of land but left with sufficient land to sustain
its family.
Tenants/sharecroppers/leaseholders or encroachers: In Indian conditions it
has been observed that such persons who do not have title or ownership right on
agricultural land do take up cultivation as tenants or sharecropper and even on
vacant government land to sustain their families. Acquisition of such land causes
only temporarily impact on their livelihood because they can shift to some other
such land in the area. However, to compensate the temporarily loss they will be
entitled to reimbursement of un-expired lease amount and assistance of 200 days
of minimum agricultural wages. Individual will be the beneficiary in this case.
Titleholder/owner of such land shall not be eligible for rehabilitation assistance in
case of leaseholder, sharecropper and tenants. However, encroachers will get
*     Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  75



these benefits if they are cultivating the acquired land continuously for last three
years from date of section-4 notification, which shall be established through Govt.
records (Voter list, Ration card etc.) or on the basis of socio-economic survey.
The above-mentioned value (amount) of rehabilitation assistance shall not
exceed the amount of compensation fixed by competent authorities.
Availability of Land for allotment to PAPs: Availability of land for persons
opting for "land for land" shall be decided as follows:
a) POWERGRID will take up the matter with concerned State Government for
release of Government land for allotment to the eligible PAPs.
b) If Government 'land is not available, POWERGRID will purchase private
land on a willing buyer and seller basis keeping in mind that the purchase
of land does not promote any indirect displacement. The land will be
purchased from voluntary sellers at existing rates finalized through
negotiations.
For purchase of private land a "Land Purchase Committee" shall be constituted by
RHQ comprising of representatives of POWERGRID, Local Authorities PAFs,
Gram Panchayat or any well-reputed person as mutually agreed with the local
authorities and PAFs.
3.3.2 Loss of Structure
This category of impact includes Individuals/families/households losing their
houses or shops and other institutional structures.
(a) Loss of houses will impact families with valid title, customary or usufruct
rights. The beneficiary unit is the individual having ownership right who will be
entitled for cash compensation as finalized by revenue authorities and Rs.
25,000/- as one time assistance (based on prevailing Government of India norms
for weaker section housing) for construction of house plus transition benefits like
provision of transport or equivalent cash for shifting of material.
In the case of tenants and leaseholders the beneficiary unit will be the individual
who will be entitled to a lump sum payment equivalent to 6 month rent based on
production of proof or Rs. 5,000/- which ever is higher as disturbance allowance to
re-establish residence.
In the case of squatters the beneficiary unit will be the Household/ family who will
be entitled to cost of structure and one time payment ranging between Rs. 5000/-
to Rs. 25000/- depending on type structure and family size because family size
has direct bearing on extent of impact plus transition benefits like provision of
transport or equivalent cash for shifting of material. However, to become eligible
for above benefits squatters have to establish that he/she is living there
continuously for last 3 years prior to section 4 notifications.
*    Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  76



Loss of shop/Dhaba or institutional structures will affect units with valid titles,
customary or usufruct rights. The beneficiary will be the individual/owner who
will be entitled to cash compensation for structure and Rs. 10,000/- for
construction of working shed/shop and rehabilitation assistance equivalent to 1-
year income towards disturbance plus transition benefits like provision of transport
or equivalent cash for shifting of material.
In case of tenants and leaseholders, the beneficiary will be the individual who
will be entitled to a transitional allowance equivalent to 1-year income plus
transition benefits like provision of transport or equivalent cash for shifting of
material.
In case of squatters, the beneficiary will be the individual who will be entitled to a
transitional allowance equivalent to 1-year income plus transition benefits like
provision of transport or equivalent cash for shifting of material. However,
squatters will get *these benefits if they are running the acquired
shop/establishment for last three years from date of section-4 notification, which
shall be established through Govt. records (voter list, Ration card etc.) or on the
basis of socio-economic survey.
Cattle shed: It has been noticed in past that some people have erected a
temporarily shed for keeping cattle in their fields which some times is not
considered by authorities for any compensation if it is not properly build. Therefore
to off set the loss owner of cattle shed shall be entitled to one time payment of Rs.
3000/- in addition to compensation fixed by revenue authorities.
3.3.3 Loss of Livelihood/Wage/Occupation
This impact affects individual access to wage/occupation. However, in case of
agricultural labour they can shift to other land since land acquired for substation is
quite small in comparison to total available land in the area. But if socio-economic
survey finding recognizes certain people who have lost its livelihood due to
acquisition of land for substation these individuals will be entitled to rehabilitation
assistance equivalent to 625 days of minimum agricultural wages preferably in
shape of a Income Generating Scheme of equivalent amount depending upon the
aptitude/skills posses by them or alternatively they may be offered units of
equivalent amount in joint name of his/her spouse under Monthly Income Scheme
for regular income. Apart from this short and need-based training on development
of entrepreneurship skills required for successful implementation of selected IGS
shall also be organized for such PAFs by POWERGRID.
Vulnerable group like women headed/SC/ST families etc. under above
mentioned categories would be considered for additional need based
benefits.
3.3.4 Loss of Access to Common Property Resources (CPR) and Facilities
In this category of impacts, the beneficiary is typically the community, and the
losses include loss of rural common property resources or urban civic
*     Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  77



communities. POWERGRID shall try all possible measures to avoid such CPRs
for setting up of substation and if it becomes completely unavoidable than it will
take following measures to negate its impact:
a) In the case of rural common property resources, the beneficiary units will
be the community entitled to replacement/augmentation of common
property resources/amenities or provisions of functional equivalence.
b) In the case of urban civic amenities, the beneficiary units will be the
community entitled to access to equivalent amenities or services.
3.3.5 Loss of Standing Crops and Trees
This category of impacts includes standing crops or trees for those with valid title
and tenants or lessees
In all cases, the family cultivating the land will be the entitlement beneficiary. In all
cases again, the beneficiary family will be entitled to cash compensation at market
rate for crops. For fruit bearing trees payment equivalent to 8 years' income and
for other trees, compensation as fixed by concerned authorities to the owner of
land. In case of tenant/leaseholder/sharecroppers payment for crop may be made
to the landowner only if there is a "no objection" certificate from the actual
cultivator.

Losses in this category include those during shifting/transport. In all categories,
the family or respective individual of commercial or institutional unit will be the
beneficiary and will be entitled to provision of transport or equivalent cash for
shifting of material/cattle from existing place to alternate place.
3.3.7 Losses to Host Communities
In this category of impact, the host community, particularly in the resettled area, its
access to amenities and services has reduced. The beneficiary host community
will be entitled to augmentation of resources to sustain pressure of project
affected persons moving from affected site.
Other rehabilitation measures
Income Generation: When alternate land is not available as per above
procedures or in cases where a PAF is not entitled to 'land for land' i.e.
eligible only for cash compensation as determined by Revenue Authorities,
the PAP may exercise one of the following options for his rehabilitation. A
variety of income generation enterprise will be offered on the basis of:
a) Consultation with PAPs and local government
b) The socio-economic survey establishing the need for such schemes

3.4   Public Consultation
Any development aotivity can be implemented successfully only by active
involvement of the beneficiaries from an early stage of project preparation. In the
projects where there are adverse impacts and loss of assets, the involvement of
affected persons assumes more significance. In order to inform public about the
project and the land acquisition, many small group meetings and public meetings
were organized time to time. The Centre for Management and Social Research
(CMSR), Hyderabad apart from carrying out the socio economic survey for the
affected people have also conducted group meetings and informed the affected
people of area (Plate-2- 4) about the project and its resultant benefit along with
POWERGRID's R&R policy and other community development programme which
will be launched during the implementation of the project.
3.4.1 Consultation on Finding of Socio-Economic Survey and Rehabilitation
Measures
As part of the Socio-economic survey a village level public consultation meeting
was organized on 19th December, 2006 at Grampanchayat office, Limbi-Chincholi.
The affected families, representatives of the Gram Panchyat, POWERGRID
officials, concerned revenue staff and the representatives of the study team,
attended the meeting (Plate-5). The issues raised and discussed as part of this
meeting include the following.
The meeting started with a brief introduction about the project by the Chief
Manager, Solapur where all the technical details of the project, the time schedule
of completion and others were explained. As part of this the Chief Manager also
cleared some of the apprehensions of the village people about some more land
acquisition and others. The participants were also told about the site selection
process and the alternatives considered in this regard.
After the brief introduction the senior consultant from the study team explained in
detail the rational of conducting the socio-economic survey and the POWERGRID
social safeguard policy. The participants were very enthusiastic to here the policy
provisions for affected families as well as provisions for the village development
activity.
A discussion on the preliminary findings of the socio-economic survey was done
where in it was noted that a majority of the affected households are small and
*     Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  85



marginal farmers primarily involved in agricultural and small time private services.
The participants opined that the affected families should be provided with
employment opportunities for the land loss. They were angst any business activity
as they do not feel a market in their village.
The various rehabilitation options such as income generation through any group
activity was discussed but most of them opined that they have to be individual
centric and not group. The some of the suggested income generation
programmes include dairy, petty shops etc. The various government programmes
and the support of the lending agencies for these programmes also discussed. On
the issue of compensation a majority of them opined that the land price
considered was very less.
On the question of their willingness to participate in the construction activity
interestingly a majority of them did not wish the village labor to work at the Sub-
Station. They requested the project authorities not to take the labor from their
village as it will badly damage their agricultural activity with non-availability of
labor in crucial times.
A detailed discussion on the availability and access to various infrastructure
facilities such as roads, drains, education, health, drinking water was undertaken
to assess the areas that need immediate attention. At the end the discussion on
this issue the areas that need immediate attention were prioritized and those are
presented as part of the community development works section in the following
paragraphs.
Most of the villagers are supportive towards the construction of the sub-station as
they are hoping that the village will be developed with the advent of the sub-
station and they are also expecting hike in the land prices and better electricity
services for their agricultural and irrigation activities.
The meeting ended on note that POWERGRID will organize some more public
consultation for the project where information regarding the overall project plan,
design and construction standards, potential impacts and mitigation measures
planned, resettlement and rehabilitation measures and assistances will be
discussed.
On the whole opinion of peoples about the project is very encouraging and
positive because it is the one of the major developmental project of Government
of India coming up in the area. The willingness shown by most of the PAPs in
parting their land for this developmental project shows that the opinion of the
people about the project is quite positive and they sincerely feel that project will
definitely improve the prevailing condition in and around the affected village.

SECTION-4: ACTION PLAN FOR REHABILITATION OF PAPs
4.0   Introduction
The overall objective of the Rehabilitation Action Plan is to ensure that the
persons affected by proposed construction of the Solapur 400/220 kV sub-station
will be provided with suitable entitlements and rehabilitation assistance to improve
their living standards. This RAP is based on the various procedures and principles
laid down by the POWERGRID in its Environmental and Social Policy Procedures
document. The RAP outlines the detailed Rehabilitation assistance to the affected
families as per the criteria, the implementation schedule and the cost and budget
for the RAP. Apart from this it also presents the public response towards proposed
project obtained through various mode of consultation for impact analysis and to
work out a meaningful, effective, workable and mutually beneficial package of
compensation measures for the affected families.
4.1   Impact of the Project: Assessment of People's Response
The construction of Solapur 400/220 kv sub-station will result in loss of 16.11 ha
of agriculture land. It is observed that the land acquired is un-irrigated agriculture
land. The verification exercise and socio-economic survey details show that, all
the 22 titleholders/persons affected are private landowners with valid titles. All
them as per the project definition provided in the ESPP can be categorized as
titleholders with valid title who are losing their agriculture land. It is only one of
them who is loosing her Semi Pucca house in the acquired land and comes under
loss of structure as well. The details are presented in the below Table 4.1.

Families as per ESPP                     framework all of them  are
been provided with suitable

6   Affected Hutment                 1       One small hutment is affected.
Apart from value of the
structure as compensation one
time housing assistance is
given as part of the RA. + She
has been provided all possible
assistance by POWERGRID in
relocation    of      her
house/belonging and has also
been provided basic amenities
like water connection and
electricity by POWERGRID.
7   Trees affected                   6       All of them are Neem trees
owned by 4 affected persons.
All of them are valued and
compensation paid.
As mentioned above the acquisition of land will have certain adverse impacts on
the local economy and the affected families initially. However the land acquired
being un-irrigated and the dependency of affected population on the agriculture is
quite less impact will be marginal. In addition this will be offset by the construction
and other activities and social benefits accruing out of the project will outweigh the
social cost associated with the local economy. The project will create much more
employment opportunities than what it is likely to affect. At the aggregate level,
there may be considerable net social gains. The project authorities have the social
responsibility of seeing the affected families not become worse-off due to loss of
land through adequate compensation and assistance.
4.2   Compensation
As the POWERGRID's policy provides compensation at prevailing market
price/replacement value, Special Land Acquisition Officer-Il, Solapur for the
project is approached by POWERGRID with a request to take all possible steps
for calculation of land cost at market price. It is to be noted that for the present
project almost all the PAPs have opted for compensation at market
price/replacement cost for losing their agricultural land. In order to assess the
market price many meetings/discussion were held in the presence of
SLO/Tehsildar/Dy Tehsildar, South Solapur for finalization of the land market
price. The entire exercise of calculation of land price was done by the concerned
revenue officials and the consultation with affected people. It was noted that due
consideration was given to the type of land, irrigated/un-irrigated status, the sale
statistics in the last five years and others. Based on the tax collected from the
different categories of land by the revenue authorities and all other relevant
*     Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  88



factors. The affected land and respective rates classified into three categories are
presented in the following Table 4.2.
Table 4.2: Land rates of valuation for the different categories

3     Agriculture-3    Rs 2.51 to 3.75           Rs 62370
Besides the compensation as per the above mentioned rates Solatium @ 30
percent and interest @ of 12% was paid for 33 days is also paid to all land
owners. Compensation for land, trees and construction was calculated and the
compensation was offered to the affected households.
The total compensation offered for the different assets and land for all the affected
households is Rs 8,82,505/- which includes Rs 6,72,725/- offered exclusively for
the land lost. The total land acquired for the sub-station is 16.11 ha therefore the
compensation offered for land is Rs 41,758 per hectare. POWERGRID has
deposited above money with the revenue department and for all land owners
through an interim award issued by the end of May, 2006 about 80% of the
compensation amount is being released and disbursed from July, 2006 onwards.
Balance 20 percent along with compensation towards trees and structure etc shall
be paid after final award is approved by competent authority. A copy of the
valuation for fixing rate and compensation amount particulars for all the affected
person is presented in the Annexure-3. Apart from this 6 numbers Neem trees
which are coming under the acquired land is also fixed as per detailed below.

4.3   Rehabilitation Assistance
4.3.1 Rehabilitation Assistance Criteria
In addition to the compensation measures for the loss of agriculture land the
affected families are assisted with rehabilitation assistance based on the severity
of losses.  Based on the severity of losses the ESPP details the following
categories for rehabilitation assistance.
*     Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  89



a) 750 days of minimum agricultural wages will be paid to families loosing
entire land thus rendered landless or option for Income Generating
Scheme (IGS) of equivalent amount for regular income;
b) 500 days of minimum agricultural wages for families loosing part land
and consequently becoming a marginal farmer;
c) 375 days of minimum agricultural wages for families loosing part land
and consequently becoming a small farmer;
d) 100-200 days of minimum agricultural wages for big farmers or families
loosing part /negligible amount of land but left with sufficient land to
sustain its family.
Based on the definition of the family the ESPP also provides for other measures
like need based assistance to widow daughter separated from her family and
unmarried sons above the age of 40 in the form of short and need-based training
in specific vocations that the PAPs may choose, coverage under Income
Generation Schemes (IGS) etc. the head of the family will become the beneficiary
in this case.
The acquisition of the land resulted in the loss of one temporary structure
(Hutment) of one of the affected household in addition to the compensation
measures the individual having ownership right is entitled to Rs 25,000/- as one
time assistance (based on prevailing Government of India norms for weaker
section housing) for construction of house plus transition benefits like provision of
transport or equivalent cash for shifting of material.
In addition to the ESPP criteria while exploring the possible options for
Rehabilitation Assistance (RA) for the affected persons the other characteristic
features that came out of the survey and considered in finalizing the RA include
the following:
* The dependency on agriculture which is very less
* The nature of the land and degree of land lost and the remaining land
holdings
* Their living standards in terms of other occupations such as service
* Their engagement in other income generating sources such as dairy,
business etc
* Their vulnerability status such the widows, women headed affected
households etc
* Their literacy levels and skills and expertise in managing entrepreneurial
activities
The above stated factors were taken into account and the underlying principle was
the utilization of the locally available resources and the skill-development of the
people involved.
4.3.2 Categorization of PAFs for Rehabilitation Assistance
During the verification exercise and the socio-economic survey the current field
situation was assessed and a total of 22 persons/titleholders were identified.
Amongst these 22 households as one of them Dhulva Ningappa Reddy w/o Late
*    Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  90



Nigappa Reddy, Survey No 92/AN2, who is part of the joint account held by 7
affected persons (Father, Mother and Sons) is dead for the purposes of RA in this
case the land acquired and the compensation given is distributed among the other
6 joint account holders who are her sons. Therefore the effective titleholders
considered are 21.
Table 4.3 presents the categorization of PAFs according to their entitlement
category, which is based on land holding after acquisition of the affected land.
Based on the definition of a family, as provided in the ESPP the total number of
PAFs identified are 35. Of these around 34 (97.14%) are eligible for assistance as
per the ESPP. Around 6 of the affected persons qualify for need based assistance
under vulnerable group such Women HH, SC etc. However none of them qualify
under dependents for need based assistance on the affected person/titleholder.
One affected person who lost her house qualifies for assistance under housing.

8    No of persons/titleholders eligible for housing assistance  1
* Vulnerable group include women headed/SC/ST physically handicapped/disabled
families
4.3.3 Minimum agricultural wage
As mentioned under the rehabilitation measures for the land-affected persons the
rehabilitation assistance for the loss of land across different categories is given as
per the minimum agricultural wages. The minimum agricultural wages in
Maharashtra are fixed based upon the division of the State into agro climatic
zones. As per the Draft notification no KVR 12006/646/Labour-7 issued on 30th
September, 2006 by the Industry, Energy & Labor Department Government of
Maharashtra the project-affected village comes under the Zone-4 for which the
minimum agricultural wage is 66 per day. A copy of the said notification is placed
as Annexure-6.
4.3.4 Economic Rehabilitation Measure
As established by the socio-economic survey a total of 19 households comprising
35 families are getting affected due to acquisition of land. As per the ESPP based
on the above given categorization of the affected families across different groups,
*     Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  91



and the minimum wages applicable for each category rehabilitation plan is
proposed. Based on the above mentioned wage rate the amount entitled by the
project affected families under different categories under the ESPP is presented in
the Table 4.4 below.

,_                                  375x66=24750
* Given the negligible amount of the land lost by the affected people under this category only 100 days is
considered
# Given the nature of loss and the compensation received 100/200/375 days is considered
From the above Table 4.4 it can be seen that in case of PAP looses the entire
land based on the minimum wage rate he is been provided with Rs 49,500 as RA.
Similarly for PAP who becomes marginal farmer Rs 33,000 is provided. In addition
to the RA an additional assistance for vulnerable PAPs is provided based upon
the extent of loss and impact on livelihood. However, in all cases where land
compensation is less than RA as per ESPP it has been restricted to amount the
PAPs have received as compensation.
As per the ESPP based on the above given categorization of the affected families
across different groups, and the minimum wages applicable for each category
rehabilitation plan is proposed. Out of the 21 PAPs for 17 of them as the RA
amount was exceeding the compensation it is adjusted to the compensation
amount. For the rest 4 PAPs according to their category full RA is being proposed.
In case of the RA amount is adjusted to the compensation paid the amounts are
distributed among the PAP and his/her eligible PAFs equally. Apart from this
additional assistance calculated for 100/200/375 days is provided to 6 PAPs
coming under vulnerable group like widow, women headed, SC etc. For the lone
PAP who lost her house is been provided with one time housing assistance of Rs
25,000. For a detailed rehabilitation plan refer Appendix-lI. The total rehabilitation
assistance amount is around Rs 6, 66,112 which is about 74.48 percent of the
total compensation amount.
4.3.5 Rehabilitation Assistance through Cash
Out of the 21 PAPs for 16 of them who are marginally impacted having left over
land and also gainfully engaged in other occupations such as services, business
the RA is given as cash assistance for augmenting their existing business and
agricultural activities. Here also cash assistance is distributed among the PAP and
eligible PAFs of respective affected persons. It needs to be noted that given the
small amounts of money most of them preferred cash assistance to improve upon
the existing resource base/activity and the scope for taking up of any IGS was
limited.
*     Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  2



4.3.6 Rehabilitation Assistance through other secured financial
Instruments
The remaining 5 PAPs who are highly impacted and also represent the vulnerable
group keeping in mind their age and other factors the RA has been offered in
shape of Bank Fixed Deposit or UTI Monthly Income Plan. It may be noticed that
the instruments suggested is both economically and financially viable. The skills
requirements are negligible and would ensure the sustainable rehabilitation.
4.3.7 Relocation of the Displaced Family
The relocation of the displaced family namely Makkamma Bai Khasim Jamadar
who happens to be the adversely affected person is being undertaken with the
help of POWERGRID officials. The affected person has shifted to her vacant left
out land where a temporary shed is being constructed with the help of concerned
POWERGRID officials. The relocated structure is being provided with power
supply and drinking water supply on temporary basis from the POWERGRID
sources. In consultation with her, she was offered a newly constructed house in
the Up coming Colony near Solapur for the Beedi workers. But she refused to
leave the present place as her family members live in the village near by.
4.3.8 Training
Further to make this plan more successful a short vocational training may also
be organised in the villages with the help of area's lead Bank/organisation for the
rural people interested in such projects. This will cover entrepreneurial skills,
financial and economic analysis, marketing, subsidies, information sources etc.
Such programs will improve the skills in the operations and maintenance of the
projects on commercial lines. These inputs will be extremely useful for the
success of the rehabilitation schemes proposed for implementation under RAP.
The financial assistance will be channelised through bank.
4.4   Labour Co-operative/Petty contracts
Wherever possible POWERGRID would try and provide for employment to the
local villagers, as manual labour and if any skilled persons from the village are
available POWERGRID would employ them for on temporary basis after
assessing their skills. As mentioned as part of the consultation findings the people
of the affected village are eagerly looking forward to this project with considerable
investment. Some of the identified positive impacts include from these investment
include the following:
* An increase in the secondary investments on infrastructure;
* Creating new infrastructure facilities resulting in attracting further
investments in the locality;
* A demand for the locally available resources;
* Secondary employment in the services sector;
* Demand for the services from the informal sector such a weeping and
cleaning, gardening, washing clothes, vegetable vending etc and
i    Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  93



* Economic transformation with sectoral shifts and lesser dependency on
agriculture for livelihood.
Some of above listed positive impact shall be there for general public as well as
for PAPs like there will be a lot of requirement of unskilled workers for the
construction work initially at the premises of POWERGRID. Contractors engaged
by POWERGRID are bound by the general condition of contract (General
Condition No.13) which stipulate local labours has to be given preference for
unskilled and semiskilled job and will be informed about the same by the project
authorities and would be asked to hire unskilled labour from the eligible PAPs. It
is to emphasize that most of the manpower required in unskilled category and in
some cases even in the skilled category shall be hired from local villages only. By
the time of completion of the project or even in between other business
opportunities like horticulture, sweeping, maintenance contracts etc. shall be there
and will be allotted to PAPs on preferential basis.
4.5   Community Developmental Work to be under-taken by POWERGRID
In  order  to  develop  surrounding  and  community  resources,  District
Administration/State Government has been approached by POWERGRID for
developmental work in the affected village of Limbi-chincholi listed under Table
4.5. The above listed works have been finalized based upon the consultations by
the consultant through village meetings and district administration. However,
minor alteration may take place during the actual implementation on the people
demand.

SECTION-5: IMPLIMENTATION AND MONITORING OF RAP
5.0  Introduction
Implementation and monitoring are critical activities in a Rehabilitation operation.
In recognition of this POWERGRID sets out procedures and lays down guidelines
for quality in implementing projects and provides a well laid down organizational
structure for the effective implementation of the ESPP.
5.1   Environment and Social Management Team (ESMT)
The implementation of RAP is to be carried out by POWERGRID for which an
Environment and Social Management Team as per ESPP has been constituted at
Solapur Sub-station with DGM (Solapur) as its in charge. Other members of the
Team are Chief Manager, Manager and one Engineer. The ESMT will take up the
implementation of RAP along with the project implementation. The key functions
of the ESMT as per policy are as follows:
* Conduct surveys on environmental and social aspects to finalize the route
for the power transmission projects
* Conduct surveys for the sites to being considered for land acquisition
* Interact with the Forest Departments to make the forest proposal and follow
it up for MoEF clearance
* Interact with the Revenue Authorities for Land Acquisition and follow it up
with Authorized Agencies of EAMP and SAMP/RAP
* Implementation of EAMP and SAMP/RAP
* Monitoring of EAMP and SAMP/RAP and producing periodic reports on the
same.
As the number of the PAPs is less POWERGRID with its in house capacity can
implement the RAP. However, if required reputed NGOs working in the affected
area may be recruited for the implementation of the RAP. A list of the NGOs
working in Solapur and specifically in South Solapur is given as Annexure-7.
5.2  Implementation Schedule
As the intensity of the Rehabilitation activity is relatively, less the proposed
activities related to the implementation of RAP would be completed in
approximately 18 months from the date of approval for implementation. A Bar
Chart for implementation of RAP having time period wise activity has been
prepared in consultation with PAPs, consultant M/s Centre for Management and
Social Research, Hyderabad and local administration. The implementation has
been divided into 5 main activities which include the following:
* Mobilization for RAP Implementation
* Implementation
* Distribution of Rehabilitation Assistance (Cash) through bank
*     Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  96



* Implementation of other Developmental works
* Review Process
The above mentioned 5 main activities have been further divided into many sub-
activities for in-depth understandings refer Bar Chart 5.1. The implementation of
RAP will start with a orientation and training camp for PAPs at a common place to
inform about the details of schemes as well as the documentation requirement for
disbursement of rehabilitation assistance. Subsequent activities will follows as per
the schedule given in Bar Chart. Implementation of the RAP by POWERGRID
shall be carried out with the active participation of PAPs, and local administration.
Public consultation would continue at every stage of implementation to assess the
effectiveness of implementation like details of inputs and services provided to the
PAPs etc.
5.3   Monitoring of RAP
POWERGRID has a well-developed organizational support structure for effective
monitoring of the Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP) The Monitoring of RAP will be
undertaken by the ESMT in place at project site under the supervision of project in
charge. In order to streamline the process it has been decided that one executive
(Social officer or Engineer) of this team shall be made responsible for all the
activities related to implementation/monitoring of proposed RAP. In addition to
this, the ESMD at the corporate office and the ESMC at the regional Headquarters
will continuously monitor the activities during the implementation of the RAP.
However, to ensure proper monitoring of implementation of RAP an independent
agency either an NGO or some institution may be engaged in consultation with
the funding agency i.e World Bank. Organizational support structure for Monitoring
of RAP is presented in Flowchart-5.2.
Internal monitoring will be taken up by the DGM (Solapur) and in charge of R&R
Cell. Details of the periodic review meetings shall be forwarded to ESMC at
Regional Head Quarters. Quarterly review meetings will be organized and
representative of RHQ and Corporate ESMD will also participate to assess the
implementation of RAP. In addition to this PAPs will have access to project
authorities through POWERGRID project office located project area. A Public
Information Centre shall also established in substation (project) premises for
dissemination of information to all stakeholders and other interested persons. An
annual review shall be done by the higher management at Corporate Office to
assess and gaze that RAP is being implemented in letter and spirit.
5.4  Evaluation of RAP Implementation
After the implementation of RAP and Evaluation and Assessment of RAP shall be
undertaken by some external agency to evaluate and assess the result of RAP
and other measures taken for betterment of PAPs.
5.5  Grievance Redressal Procedures
*    Rehabilitation Action Plan for 400/220 Kv Sub-station at Solapur  97



To address problems of PAPs during implementation of RAP the POWERGRID
has set up a Grievance Redress Committee (GRC) constituted through
nomination from different bodies and representatives such as local administration,
PAPs, Panchayat. Table 5.1 presents a GRC constituted for Solapur comprising
of following members.
