PROJECT COMPLETIO REPCRT
MAURITIUS
FIFTH AND SIXTH DEVELOPMENT BANK OF MAURITIUS PROJECTS
(LOANS 1789-MAS AND 2164-MAS)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report covers the Fifth and Sixth
Development Bank of Mauritius Projects, which are herein revieved together
given that DBM VI was in effect a follow-up phase of DBM ', thereby
constituting one project. This was evidenced by the fact that no staff
appraisal report was done for DBM VI, instead the appraisal report for DBM
V was used as the basis for both loans. DBM V, in the amount of US$6.0
million, was approved on December 27, 1979 and DBM VI, in the amount of
US$6.0 million, was approved on June 1, 1982. DBM V was closed four
years behind schedule and DBM VI was terminated and prepaid 6 months ahead
of schedule.   US$5.5 million was disbursed under DBM V, with last
disbursement date, May 6, 1987.   Under DBM VI, US$4.0 million was
disbursed with last disbursement date, May 29, 1987.
TPhe PCR for the two projects was prepared by the Industry and
Energy Operations Divisio%n, Eastern Africa Department, of the Africa
Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III).
Preparation of this PCR was started in December, 1990 and is
based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Reports; the Loan and Guarantee
Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda. The PCR was sent to the Borrower
for its comments, and are incorporated as Part II.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MAURITIUS
FIFTH AND SIXTH DEVELOPMENT BANK OF HALURITIUS PROJECTS
(LOANS 1789-MAS AND 2164-MAS)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obi ectives
1.        The macro-objective of the Fifth and Sixth DBM projects was to
support the Government of Mauritius development plans to diversify the economy,
reduce its dependence on sugar, achieve full employment through the creation
of new industries, mustly in the export product/service sectors, and the
development of the artisan/small-scale  enterprise  sector.   The  specific
objectives were twofold: 1) continue to provide foreign exchange financing to
support DBM's lending programs, and 2) continue technical support and
assistance in the development of DBM's internal operations (paras. 1-18).
Implementation
2.        Under DBM V, all phases of the project processing and implementation
were executed on schedule except the period for disbursement (Part III-2A).
The projected disbursement period was optimistic given the expected slowdown
in the Mauritian economy. Also, the allocations to various components of the
loan had to be modified given the failure of the Mauritian Commercial Bank
Refinancing Schemes (HCB-RS) and the initial slow pace of funding to the Small
Scale Enterprises (SSE) (paras. 19-21; Part !II-4A&B, 6A).
3.        Under DBM VI, all phases of project processing were executed on
schedule up to loan effectiveness.  Given the slow pace of draw-down under
DBM V, the need for DBM VI was not evident at the time it was approved. Loan
processing should have been postponed until DBM V was almost fully committed.
Prior to committing the totality of available funds, DBM VI was terminated and
prepaid because of the high foreign exchange risk cost associated with Bank
funds (para. 23; Part III-2B).
Results
4.        DBM's performance vis-a-vis the projects under review was satisfac-
tory. The on-lending operations resulted in 52 sub-projects with total funding
of US$5.5 million under DBM V and 50 sub-projects with total funding of US$4.0
million under DBM VI being sanctioned. The aggregate was 102 sub-projects with
total funding of US$9.5 million (paras. 24, 26, 27, 29).   In the area of
internal operations development, the projects achieved the following results:
1) the development of a strategic plan including a project promotion program;
2) a reorganization program; 3) improvements in DBM's follow-up procedures with
corresponding reductions in arrears; and 4) the creation of a foreign exchange
hedging scheme (para. 25).



- iv -
Sustainabilitv
5.        The project sustainability is reasonably assured for the following
reasons:  1) DBM is a long established government-sponsored institution with
relatively sound management and proven record; 2) DBM is the principal source
of foreign exchange term-financing to the industrial and tourism sectors; 3)
DBM has adequate access to financial resources from International Financing
Agencies (IFAs) and local sources; and 4) DBM's performance during the
project's period (1980-1986) showed total assets increased by 972, net profit
increased from Re. 7.8 million in 1980 to Rs. 16.3 million in 1986 and
provision to total portfolio r&tio was maintained at an average 4.3X
(paras. 30-32; Part 111-6B).
Lessons of Experience
6.        A few lessons may be drawn from the experience of these projects.
First, the implementation procedures for new programs like the MCB-RS should
be worked out with all relevant parties at the initial stages of the project
process to assure commitment by 4mplementing agencies.  Second, the foreign
exchange risk implicit in borrowing Bank funds should be mitigated through some
hedging mechanisms to the extent that the effective interest cost to the sub-
borrower is reasonable.   Third, the timetable for implementation of these
projects should have been more conservative. Lastly, focused lending programs
like the SSE scheme should be earmarked specific resources, and separated from
general operations (paras. 40-43).

Subsector                Industrial Finance
II. BACKGROUND
1.       Historically, the economy of Mauritius had been dependent on the
production of sugar and its ancillary industries. During the 1970s/1980s, the
Government of Mauritius targeted the diversification of the economy and full
employment through new jobs creation, particularly for skilled and semi-skilled
workers, as the primary objectives of its development plans.
2.       Emphasis was focused on the manufacturing sector by encouraging new
industries, mostly in export products/sez-Jices due to the saturation of
import-substitution industries and the limited growth potential of the domestic
market. The objectives were to be achieved by attracting private investments
through a genercus package of incentives to investors, sett.Lng up of industrial
estates and public investments in infrastructure for the benefit of the
manufacturing sector.   The GOM,  also provided subsidized funding to the
indigenous artisan/small-scale sector.
3.       Notwithstanding the movement towards diversification, the sugar estate
sector needed substantial investments for the improvement of crop yields,
modernization of processing facilities and mechanization of harvesting
iunctions.
4.       Government also sought to develop the tourism sector as a source of
foreign exchange and employment.
5.       To achieve the -tbove objectives, the financial sector was being
strengthened and expanded with the injection of new funds from international
and bilateral financing agencies (including the Bank, ADB, USAID, CCCE, IDBI,
etc.) and the creation of new institutions (e.g. Stat.e Finance Corporation) to
provide specialized financial services.

III. LINKAGES BETWEEN PROJECTS' SECTOR AND MACRO POLICY OBJECTIVES
6.       The Bank's lending program was designed to support the COM's objective
of diversification to reduce the economy's dependence on sugar by developing
new export-oriented industries as tha most appropriate means of achieving full
employment. The DBM was established by the Government in 1964 and reorganized
in 1970 with the Bank Group's assistance. It provides financing to medium and
large-scale enterprises and for tcourism development and was identified by the
Bank was the primary vehicle to channel direct financing to the targeted
sectors. Accordingly, beginning in 1972, the DBM received four loans from the
Bank totalling US$23.5 million equivalent for on-lending to industrial and
tourism projects and an IDA credit of US$4 million equivalent to support the
construction of an industrial estate.  The DBM managed a scheme to provide
financing to artisans/small-scale industrial enterprirss and a program of
assistance to small agriculturalist. In line with the Government development
strategy, DBM was also expected to provide some financial assistance for the
modernization and possibly mechanization of sugar estates.
7.       DBM V and VI complemented the Bank's strategy of supporting the
development of the country's infrastructure as an impetus to industrial growth.
Other projects funded by the Bank included credits for improvements to the port
and new facilities like the bulk sugar terminal and Structural Adjustment Loans
(SALs). The Bank also lent support to the GOM's investment 4ncentives program
which gave tax holidays and duty exemptions to import-substitution and
export-oriented enterprises, by providing financial assistance through DBM.
The GOM also implemented a promotion program in Europe to attract foreign
investors.
8.       The Bank's loans to DBM helped make it the principal source of
term-finance for the industrial and tourism sectors. DBN V introduced a scheme
for DPM to refinance commercial banks' foreign exchange advances. The support
to the artisan/small-scale enterprises (SSE) sector, was enhanced and the GOM
was persuaded to reduce interest subsidy for this sector.
9.       DES was also able to institute Export Credit Guarantee and Export
Credit Insurance Schemes to support Export Processing Zone (EPZ) factories and
other export oriented enterprises.
IV. PROJECTS' OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
10.      The DBM V's objectives were to assist DBM provide part of the term
foreign exchange financing needed by medium and large-scale industrial,
agro-industrial and tourism enterprise (via the commercial banks if appropri-
ate), expand its financial and technical assistance to the artisan and small-
scale sector, and continue financing the mechanization of the sugar estates to
alleviate their harvesting problems. These objectives were in line with the
GOM 5-year Development Plan to create new industrial and commercial employment
opportunities and diversity the economy away from sugar. Under DBM V, the Bank
was able to continue to provide technical support and assistance in the
development of DBN's internal operations.
11.      The general objective of DBM VI was to build on the six previous Bank
projects, which had strengthened DBM as a Development Bank. AT the same time,

it was to rein;rce the A-  Group efforts to assist development of industry
and tourism in Mauritius,     h was a major part of the Government's adjustment
program. It complemented ;he SAL approved in 1981. Specifically, the loan was
to provide DBM with untied _.reign exchange resources for 1982/83 and 1983/84,
necessary for it to continue to play a meaningful role in the development of
the Mauritian economy by financing in the above sectors. It also provided up
to $300,000 to finance studies of the industrial and financial sectors.
12.      DBM V, in the amount of US$6.0 million, was to assist DBM in financing
directly or through Mauritian-owned Co-uercial Banks  (MCBs),  the foreign
exchange component of loans and invastments in industry, agro-industry, and
tourism. The loan was also to help cover the foreign exchange component of
artisan and small-scale enterprises investment needs. The allocations were:
US$3.0 million for direct lending; US$2.0 million for lending through MCBs;
and US$1.0 million for lending to SSEs.
13.      DBM VI, also in the amount of US$6.0 million, had two main purposes:
1) to finance studies of the industrial and financial sectors, to be carried
out by Government with the aid of consultants, intended to develop policies and
institutional arrangements conducive to the growth of industrial production and
exports; and 2) to assist DBM in financing the foreign exchange comporent of
loans and investments in industry, agro-industry and tourism, including the
foreign exchange component of investment by small-scale enterprises.
14.      Both lines of credit were granted on the Bank's standard terms for
development finance institutions. Prior Bank approval was necessary for each
subproject requiring Bank funds in excess of US$600,000. The aggregate free
limit for DBM's approval of sub-projects %'nder US$600,000 was set at US$3.0
million under each project.
V. PROJECTS' PREPARATION. APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
15.      DBM V was first identified in the Bank,'s super7ision of DBM IV in
re, ruary 1978. Issues raised in the project brief concerned the slow pace of
cc Tr._tment under the ongoing DBM IV project. The timing and amount of the new
loan was subject to accelerating the commitment of DBM IV and DBM's need for
funds, taking into account the availability of funds from other IFAs.  The
appraisal mission proposed a multi-program approach and made the project
conditional on GOM commitment to provide adequate local currency funds for DBM
working capital needs and to continue the split-risk sharing scheme on DBM's
foreign exchange borrowings.l/ DBM V was approved by the Board in December,
1979, signed in January, 1980, and became effective three months later in April
1980.
16.      The issues raised in the DBM VI project brief centered on the need for
DBM to re-examine its strategy for meeting its general developmental objective.
Areas of concern included:   1) reorganization and staff improvements;  2)
1/ Foreign exchange risk sharing scheme:
a) Loans to SSE - Foreign exchange risk carried by GOM;
b) All other loans - Rupee to US$ risk carried by sub-borrower
and US$ to disbursed currencies risk carried by GOM.

replacement of expatriate Mar.aging Director with a Nauritiang 3) the need to
strengthen its promotional activities; 4) the elimination or veduction of
intereet subsidies to SSEs; and 5) reduction in high level of arrears in DBM
loan portfolio. The difficulties in implementing the MCB-RS unde,: DBN V was
discussed, and the problems identified included legal impediments regarding the
contractual arrangements between the DBM, the MCBs and the Central Bank. Also
raised were concerns about the foreign exchange risk guarantee scheme with the
participation of the Bank.
17.      In view of the fact that policy issues were being addressed under the
SAL lending and the absence of major institutional and project issues, the Loan
Committee decided to waive the yellow cover review. The amount of the loan was
to be based on the exp3cted funding to DBM from EIB and ADB taking into account
the effects of the 9/8'. devaluation. There were some concerns regarding the
continuation of the foreign exchange risk sharing scheme and the implications
of the GOM's proposal to establistn the State Finance Corporation (SFC) to
mobilize local resources to provide term loans to the industrial sector.  The
main issue here was whether this would be complementary to DBN or competitive.
18.      To address issues raised during negotiations:  DBM agreed to prepare
an operation strategy statement and action plan, and to review the status of
DBM's expatriate Managing Director vis-a-vis a Mauritian Managing Director.
The Bank agreed to increase the SSE qualifying ceiling from Rs. 25,000 to Rs.
50,000, and to include in the loan, the amount of US$300,000 to employ
consultants to carry out studies of the industrial and financial sectors. DBM
VI was approved by the Board and signed in June 1982 and became effective in
September 1982.
VI. PROJECTS' IMPLEMENTATION
19.      The most critical variance  between  planned  and  actual project
implementation was in regards to the period for disbursement. At the projected
closing date for DBM V only 38% of estimated disbursements had been made. For
DBM VI, 74% had been disbursed when DBM terminated the project and prepaid the
outstanding loan amount.
20.      The other area of significant variance involved the allocations to the
various components of the loans: Under DBM V, the entire allocation of US$2.0
million for MCB-Rs. and US$0.5 million of the US$1.0 million allocation for the
SSE component had to be reallocated to the Medium and Large-Scale Enterprises
(MLEs) component.
21.      The change in allocation is understandable given that both the MCB-Rs.
and SSE programs were new and innovative; effectively constituting test-cases.
However, the disbursement pattern could have been anticipated as both the Bank
and DBM expected an economic slowdown. The Bank may have over-estimated the
impact of its SAL and infrastructure lending programs and the GOM's investment
incentives and promotional efforts by assuming an early reversal of the
economic trend and a corresponding increase in sub-projects' commitments by
DBM.
22.      DBM was a long established and basically sound institution and the two
Bank financed projects we.e the fifth and sixth in a series of industrial



on-lending loans from the Bank. Therefore, the Bank was in the position to
anticipate and prepare for risks.   Given the concerns about DBM's h±gh
portfolio arrears and the slow pace of new sub-projects, DBM was required to
formulate a new strategic development plan including an investment promotion
program. Pressure was applied to recruit a new, preferably Mauritian CEO, and
the GOM was required to guarantee the availability of adequate local currency
resources for DBM's working capital needs.   The foreign exchange risk was
covered under a sharing scheme, whereby, foreign exchange risk on loans to SSEs
was carried by the GOM and on all other loans; the Rupee to US dollars risk was
carried by the sub-borrower and the US dollars to disbursed currencies was
carried by GOM.
23.      Subsequent to the analysis of the initial project and after negotia-
tions, the Mauritian Rupee underwent the first in a series of devaluations from
Rs. 6.14 to US$1.00 in 1979 to Rs. 15.95 in 1985.  While this should have
boosted the Mauritian export industries and tourism sector, the implications
for firms with foreign exchange obligations were disastrous. The sub-borrowers
under these projects were negatively affected.  The foreign exchange losses
incurred and uncertainty as to future losses rendered the Bank's loan
unattractive. The DBM responded by instituting a foreign exchange risk cover
scheme and the GOM assumed most of the foreign exchange risk. However, the
easy availability of moderately priced local currency loans and ready access
to foreign exchange through the Central Bank coupled with cheaper funds from
other funding agencies; (CCCE, EIB, ADB and IDBI) made it advantageous for DBM
to terminate and prepay DBM VI before completion date.
VII. PROJECTS' RESULTS
24.      The results of the projects' on-lending operations were as follows:
under DBM V, 52 sub-projects with total funding of US$5.5 million and under DBM
VI , 50 sub-projects at US$4.0 million; an aggregate of 102 sub-projects at
US$9.5 million. Under the two projects US$2.5 million was canceled; US$0.5
million under DBM V due to delays in commitment of funds and US$2.0 million
under DBM VI due to cost of high foreign exchange risk associated with Bank
funds. The Bank's supervision reports did not review the performance of the
sub-projects financed under the two lines of credit.  However, a review of
DBM's Provisions to Total Portfolio ratio over the project's period (1980-1986)
shows DBM maintaining a 4.0% (+/-) compared to the appraisal projects of 6.0%
(+/-).   DBM's actual net profits exceeded appraisal projections each year
during the project's period, and its total assets increased from Rs. 395.4
million in 1980 to Rs. 778.4 million in 1986 compared to projects of Rs. 569.3
for 1986.
25.      The  realization  of  internal  operations  objectives  achieved  the
following results:
1) development of new strategic plan for DBM;
2) re-organization program including staff strengthening;
3) development of promotion program;
4) substantial reduction in portfolio and rent arrears; and
5) the creation of a foreign exchange hedging scheme.



26.      The reallocation of funds under DBM V from the MCB-RS to DBM's normal
MLE program involved no change of final beneficiaries, only a change in the
levels of intermediation. The SSE program, though slow under DBM V, showed
exceptional results overall; DBM's disbursement to the sector over the projects
period totalled Rs. 119.1 million as compared to projections of Rs. 19.6
million.
27.      The ERR and IRR were not determined for the project, however, a review
of operational results shows the actual figures nominally equal to the
projections for the initial three years (1980-1983) but exceeding projections
under each category over the full project period (SI-6 A&B). Most significant,
DBM's resource base increased from Rs. 418.7 million at 6/79 to Rs. 567.0 at
6.81 to Rs. 945.9 million at 3/86 (last supervision). Job creation in the male
dominated SSE sector compensated for jobs creation in the EPZ sector, which
predominantly employed women thereby, achieving some balance in the
social/family structure.
28.      DBM VI provided for studies of the industrial and financial sectors.
A consultant was contracted to worK with the Mauritian Ministry of Econom4c
Planning and Development to undertake a study of trade and industry policy and
implementation, with the objective of formulating trade and industrialization
policies that would foster more rational use of resources, spur economic
growth, and generate higher levels of employment. The study was undertaken
ahead of schedule and at a lower cost than in the appraisal estimate.
Subsequent supervision reports did not comment on the study's findings nor on
the status of its implementation. Given the long-term implications of policy
implementation, a proper assessment of the impact of the study was not
realistic at the time the project closed. Accordingly, no evaluation was made
in the supervision reports.
29.      Overall, the project assisted in sustaining DBM as a strong, viable
local institution to serve as a catalyst for industrial development in
Mauritius.
VIII.  PROJECTS' SUSTAINABILITY
30.      DBM is a long established government-sponsored institution which has
become the principal source of term-finance to the industrial and tourism
sectors and is closely linked to the GOM's macro-developmental objectives. The
Bank and other international financing agencies (ADB, EIB, CCCE, IDBI, USAID,
etc.) have identified DBM as the primary conduit of industrial development
funds to Mauritius which helps to ensure its long-term viability.
31.      The principal factors affecting DBM's continued importance are:
1) availability of adequate financial resources;
2) good management with well-trained professional
support staff; and
3) an effective strategic plan with clear outlines of
specific programs.
The availability of resources seemed assured from the international financing
agencies and local sources; GOM and local bond market. With the assistance of



- 7 -
the Bank, DBM underwent a re-organization including staff strengthening and as
a condition of Loan DBM VI, DBM developed a revised strategic plan which met
the approval of the Bank.
32.      Risk factors of concern are the inherent tendency of DFCS to follow
the business cycles of their targeted industries and the political risk of
government interference with management. The first concern could be mitigated
by DBM diversifying its lending programs and spreading its commitments within
programs. The second concern is politically sensitive given that DBM is ownled
effectively by the Government.
IX. BANK PERFORMANCE
33.      The main strength of the Bank vis-a-vis the projects was its long
working relationship with DBM, in particular, and its experience with DFC lines
of credit in general. Concurrently, the Bank was implementing several other
lending programs in Mauritius, including a SAL program, thereby complementing
the Bank's involvement int he project. Most important, the Bank was in the
position to significantly influence the DBM with regards to improvement in its
internal operations through conditions in the loan agreement, recommendations
from the supervision missions, and interactions with DBM.
34.      On the downside, it appeared that the structuring of the projects was
unduly influenced by the Bank's other programs, resulting in optimistic
disbursement schedules. Also, there was not adequate collaboration with the
MCBs on the structuring of the refinancing scheme at the appraisal stage. A
strong negative was the foreign exchange risk inherent in borrowing Bank funds
which rendered the cost of funds uncertain and, at worse, very expensive given
the devaluating Mauritian Rupee. The foreign exchange losses to sub-borrowers
on repayment were substantial.   At the p int DBM VI was prepaid, the Bank
calculated the effective rate at 16 percent compared with the nominal fixed
rate of 11.6 percent.
35.      Project  identification  and  preparation  evolved  from  the Bank's
continuing involvement with DBM, but was innovative in advancing the MCB-RS and
SSE programs along with the traditional on-lending to MLEs. However, detailed
implementation programs should have been worked out at the initial stage.
36.      The appraisal process was carried out in a timely fashion and was
without major issues. The Bank, however, either underestimated the slowdown
in the Mauritian economy or overestimated the impact of its SAL and other
programs, and the impact of the GOM's investment promotion efforts, in
projecting the disbursement timetable.
37.      As regards Bank supervision of the projects, recommendation by a
supervision team for semi-annual missions was unheeded as this was considered
too frequent given the nature of the project and DBH's proven record.  The
supervision missions and attending reports were used effectively to stimulate
improvements in DBM's internal operations and to follow through on compliance
with loan covenants. They also facilitated the modification of the project by
justifying the reallocation of funds and extensions of closing date when
expedient.

X. BORROWER PERPORMANCE
38.      The main strengths of the borrower were its long experience and proven
track record in industrial on-lending, excellent governmental support and ready
access to multiple  sources of funds, both foreign and local.    initial
weaknesses included; the lack of defined promotion program, weak follow-up
functions, an expatriate senior management unwilling to tackle sensitive
issues, and policy dependence on the GOM even as regards staffing consider-
ations.
39.      The Borrower was active in the project preparation and cooperated
fully with the appraisal mission through project effectiveness. Implementation
was slow, mainly due to a general economic slow-down. The Borrower, however,
undertook serious efforts to improve project promotion and project supervision
functions. The MCB-RS failed due to problems with implementation modalities
and the foreign exchange risk implications. The SSE program was successfully
introduced under DBM V and enhanced under DBM VI, with actual commitments to
the sector over the projected period being 5.. times greater than the appraisal
projections.
XI. LESSONS LEARNED
40.      One of the lessons learned from the projects is that new programs like
the MCB-RS should be thoroughly vetted with parties who would be charged with
its implementation and should only by incorporated in the project with their
knowledge and agreement. Active participation and agreement of the concerned
institutions at the appraisal stage probably would have forestalled the failure
of the MCB-RS.
41.      Secondly, the foreign exchange risk implicit in borrowing Bank's funds
by projects in countries with rapid devaluing currencies, should only be
undertaken if an appropriate foreign exchange risk scheme is in place.
Alternately, the sub-borrowers should have the choice of assuming the exchange
risk or paying higher interest without the risk.   The Borrower should
rationalize its foreign borrowings in terms of both lending operations and
profitability, as evidenced by the early termination and prepayment of DBM VI.
42.      Thirdly, estimate of credit needs and timetable for commitment of sub-
projects and disbursement of funds under DBM V should have been more conserva-
tive, particularly so given the trend under DBM IV and the anticipated economic
slowdown. DBM VI was probably not needed at the time its was approved.
43.      The fourth lesson is that focussed lending programs like the SSE
scheme, are most effective when the necessary resources are specif.:ally
allocated to the particular programs and not included in general operations.
XII. COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNMENT'S PART II
44.      In general, there is broad concurrence between the Bank and GOM on
project performance.   The Government's Part II elaborates on the Bank's
discussion (providing context and highlighting DBM successes and areas where
the Bank's  role was  particularly  constructive).    There  are  some minor
discrepancies in the Bank's statistical tables (due to unavailability of data,



which has now been provided) and these have been corrected. Part I, para-
graph 7 - The sentence beginning "other projects" refers to Bank lending to GOM
(and not channeled through DBM). Part I, paragraph 9 - the word "industrial
estates" has been deleted to correct a factual error.
XIII. PROJECTS' DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
45.      Most of the data relevant to the preparation of the PCR is available
in the project files (though it is somewhat scantier in the last year), and the
Bank's resource input data is available in the MIS except for the costing
information, which was not done on an individual project basis at the point the
project closed.
46.      The supervision reports did not include information on the performance
of the sub-projects approved under DBM V and VI which is understandable given
the fact that performance results are normally spread over a long period. Also
in this particular case, a final supervision/project completion mission was not
undertaken, given that the DBM VI was abruptly terminated and prepaid by DBM.
47.      A useful practice would be for supervision reports to include a review
of the required statistics as formatted in Part III of the PCR Guidelines.
This would significantly reduce the time to prepare PCRs, and only nominally
increase the time for supervision reports, given that the information would be
part of the working data of the supervision mission.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Part II is the Development Bank of Mauritius' comments on Part I and III of the
Project Completion Report.
A. The Adeauacv and Accuracy of the Factual Information in Part III of the
Proiect Comnletion Report,
We consider that the factual information contained in P;c III of the
PCR as adequate. However, we have noted certain discrepancies on page 27, 28
and 29, which deal with the Project Results - Forecast Operations compared to
actuals -
(1) Approvals,
(2) Disbursements, and
(3) Financial Position and Indicators.
We have accordingly appended the revised pages 27, 28 and 29 as
Axnnexures I, II and III.
B. Comment on Analysis Contained in Part I.
We broadly concur with the contents and views expressed in the
background of the report.
However, in paragraph 7, under the heading "Linkages between Projects
Sector and Macro Policy Objectives", we must point out that projects funded by
the World Bank such as improvements to the port and new facilities like the
Bulk Sugar Terminal and Structural Adjustment Loans (SALs) were not channeled
through the DBM. They were direct lending to the Government of Mauritius.
Regarding setting up of Export Credit Guarantee and Export Credit
Insurance Schemes of DBM mentioned in paragraph 9, while not denying the
positive role of the World Bank all along, we would like to state that these
two schemes were introduced by DBM without the involvement of any outside
foreign agencies.  It must be also mentioned that the above schemes covered
exporters generally, but certainly not industrial estates whose need for
financial assistance is of a totally different nature.
We have noted certain discrepancies in the growth of assets and
movements of profits which we are reporting in Annex III and which consequently
slightly alter the results in paragraphs 24, 27, and 32.
Regarding paragraph 37, we would like to mention that DBM was headed
by a Mauritian as its Chief Executive between 1982 and 1984.
In paragraph 41, two approaches are broadly defined as regards
problems relating to foreign exchange risks namely, the operation of a hedging
scheme or a higher interest rate to neutralize the risks. A third alternative
will be a formula acceptable to the World Bank, the Government of Mauritius or
the Borrower and the sub-borrowers wherein the risks will be shared among
themselves in a predefined ratio. The logic behind this alternative is that
adverse foreign exchange fluctuations affecting sub-borrowers are caused by



- 11 -
external factors and it is but equitable that the World Bank takes a share in
the loss. It may be mentioned that DBM introduced in 1984, Foreign Exchange
Risk Scheme in terms of which sub-borrowers were required to pay higher
interest for borrowing without the foreign exchange risk.
C. The Bank's Performance during the Evolution and Imtplementation of the
Proiect, with Special EmDhasis on Lessons Learnt that may be Relevant to the
Future.
The World Bank remained the first and foremost source of foreign
exchange funds for DBM throughout the period under review.  At Rs. 108.2
million in ;980, this represented 72% of all DBM's overseas credits. In 1986,
the position was Rs. 216.2m which was 55% of all DBM's foreign credits.
Increasing commitments from other foreign sources underly confidence in DBM as
a stable and viable institution.
On a macro-level, the provision of long-term funds from the World Bank
enabled the DBM to meet its operational obligations, thus contributing to the
establishmerLt or expansion of industrial enterprises, creation of employment
and generation or saving of foreign exchange.
On internal operations, we agree that new programs like the MCB-RS
should be thoroughly vetted with parties who would be involved with its
implementation and should only be incorporated in the project with their
knowledge and agreement.
We also agree that foreign exchange risks implicit in borrowings from
World Bank for projects in countries with currency devaluating tendencies
should only be undertaken, if an appropriate foreign exchange risk hedging
scheme is in place.
D. The Borrower's own Performance durint the Evolution and Implementation with
Special Emphasis on Lessons Learnt that mav be Relevant to the Future.
Perhaps the most significant performance of DBM during the period
under review, is its ability to mobilize and provide funds for economic
development when many DFC's, especially in the Third World, have been unable
to do so. It has broad based its sources of funds and has been able to evolve
over the years as a self-reliant institution.   DBM has also been able to
sustain and update the skills of its staff in investment appraisal and
supervision fielda so as to ensure continuity and face expansion of operations.
The quality of its loans portfolio also showed improvement through a balanced
spread among various sectors, in consonance with economic policy and trends
during the period under review.
On the financial side, DBM's actual net profits grew from Rs. 8.4m in
1980 to Rs. 15.2m in 1986, an average annual growth rate of 13.9Z. Its total
assets at Rs. 384.6m in 1980 stood at 848.9m in 1986 at historical costs. It's
net worth improved from Rs. 72m in 1980 to Rs. 114m in 1986. On operations
side, the volume of sanctions which was Rs. 51m in 1980 increased to Rs. 240m
in 1986, an increase of 370%. Disbursements recorded proportionate growths,
from Rs. 34m in 1980 to Rs. 160m in 1986.

E. The Effectiveness of the Relationship Between the Bank and the Borrower
durina the Evolution and Imolementation of the Proiect.
The historical working relationship between the Bank and DBM has
helped the latter to adopt the appraisal standards and follow-up procedures
required by the invernational institutions. The positive attitude of the Bank
has contributed to a great deal in facilitating a smooth flow of communication
between the two.
It is thus that while the Bank reacted favourably to the Borrower's
requests for the two credits, the latter implemented the Bank's recommendations
for the:
(a) development of a new strategic plan,
(b) reorganization program including staff reinforcement,
(c) development of industrial promotion program through the
provision of risk capital credit,
(d) reduction in loan portfolio affected by arrears and rent
arrears, and
(e) the creation of a foreign exchange hedging scheme.
On the manpower development, the Borrower has continued to avail of
the training programs sponsored by the Economic Development Institute (EDI),
thereby contributing to the upgrading of the skills of the staff of the
institution.
On the macro level, the support of the Bank has helped the Borrower
to play its catalytical role for economic growth in Mauritius, being the most
important conduit of long term funds for the industrial and tourism sectors.
F. The Performance of Co-Financiers and the Effectiveness of their Relationship
with the Borrower during the Evolution and Implementation of the Proiect.
DBM has successfully mobilized and diversified the sources of its
foreign long-term funds over the years based on its record and performance.
Apart from the World Bank and its affiliated agencies, DBM has thus tapped
funds from the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique, the African
Development Bank and the European Investment Bank during the period under
review.
All the above-named financial agencies have organized supervision
missions regularly and are generally satisfied with our performance.

CAISSE CENTRALE
The Caisse Centrale's lending program was designed to support DBM in
meeting its commitments mainly to agricultural diversification and tourism
development. These objectives were in line with the Government of Mauritius'
plan to give a boost to agriculture while at the same time to sustain the
growth in the tourism sector.
The results of the projects on-lending operations were as follows:
Year              Amount of Credit        No. of Sub-Proiects

103.25                     81
During the period under review, the Caisse Centrale sanctioned 6 lines
of credit totalling 103.25m FF for 81 sub-projects. Of the above, the pilot
project for developing new energy resources in Mauritius out of Bagasse stands
out as a bold commitment of the agency in funding an innovative and explorative
project.   Out of the 47m FF financed for the project, 37.4m were finally
utilized.
At the beginning of the period under review, Caisse Centrale's long
term credits represented merely 22 of all DBM's foreign sources of funds. Over
time it made deep inroad in DBM's foreign resources composition through its
attractive terms and faith in the country and its institutions. By the end of
the review, its importance as a source of long term credit for DBM stood at 18%
and was second only to the World Bank.



- 14 -
EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK
European Investment Bank's lending program was designed to support DBM
in meeting its long term financial commitments to the industrial and tourism
sectors. A special feature of EIB's support during the period under review was
risk capital resources of ECUs 0.5m sanctioned to DBM for enabling the latter
to participate and suipport in the equity capital of the promoters and for
undertaking studies for identifying potential projects.
The results of the projects on-lending operations were as follows:
Line of Credit       Year       Amount of Credit       No. of Sub-proiects
EIB Pret 11-1        1982            4.0 ECUs                    17
EIB Pret 11-2        1982           0.5 ECUs                      2
EIB Pret III         1986           6.0 ECUs                     19
10.5 ECUs                    38
During the period under review, EIB sanctioned 3 lines of credit
aggregating 10.5m ECUs for 38 sub-projects.  Quite a number of projects both
in the industrial and tourism sectors was set up with the EIB lines of credit
on attractive terms. With the establishment of the State Investment Corpora-
tion Limited in 1986, the role played by the DBM in providing equity capital
support was taken over by the former and the major portion of DBM's investments
in share capital of company were also transferred to that institution.
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)
DBM signed a line of credit II for UA 3 million with ADB in February
1983. The purpose was to finance the foreign exchange component of medium and
large size sub-projects in the manufacturing, agro-industrial, mining and
quarrying sectors. The ADB funds were restricted to enterprises having local
majority shareholdings and predominantly African management.
Line of Credit       Year       Amount of Credit       No. of Sub-proiects

ADB Line of
Credit II            1983              3 UA                      36
Under the above credit, 36 sub-projects were assisted for an amount
aggregating 3 UA's.  The line of credit under ADB has proved to be of benefit
to the DBM in view of its flexib lity as regards extension of its credit and
its terms considered relatively soft.

Cozments on Prolect Timetable:
1)    Identification:  Project identified in the Bank's supervision
report on DBM dated February, 1978.
2)    Preparation:  Issues raised in project brief;  slow pace of
commitment under ongoing DBM IV project. Timing and amount of
loan subject to accelerating commitment of DBM IV and DBM need for
funds taking into account, availability from other sources,
respectively.
3)    Appraisal Mis-ion:  The appraisal mission proposed a multi-program
approach, compartmentalizing the credit into three parts: (i)
medium/large-scale industry, agro-industry and tourism; (ii)
artisan/small-scale enLerprises (subject to change in on-lending
rates); (iii) refinancing of Mauritian Commercial Banks. Project
also conditional on GOM commitment to provide adequate local



- 20 -
currency funds for DBM working capital needs and to continue the
split-risk scheme on DBM foreign-exchange borrowings.
4)    Loan Negotiations:  Issues for negotiation:
(a)   GOM and DBM policy regarding on-lending rate to SSE.
(b)   Foreign exchange risk sharing formula in respect of ML!,
sub-borrowers.
(c)   Provision of adequate local currency resources for DBM
operations.
(d)   Reporting requirements during project implementation.
(e)   DBM future investments in the sugar sector.
(f)   Mechanism for refinancing of MCBs and forecast of theiL
foreign exchange finance requirements.
(g)   DBM wanted percentage of Bank funds covering civil works
increased from 45Z to 60?.
5)    Board Approval:  Approved with standard conditions, deadline for
effectiveness of MCB-RS refinancing scheme set at 6/80.
6)    Loan Agreement Signature:  No substantive issues.
7)    Loan Effectiveness:  GOM requested extension of final
effectiveness date due to its delay of standard ratific'Lion and
legal opinion requirements.
8)    Loan Completion Date:  Terminal date for submission of sub-project
extended at the request of DBM due to failure of scheme for
refinancing of MCBs, and slow commitment of funds to SSE sector:
full amount of US$2.0 million allocated to MCB-RS scheme and US
$0.5 million of US$1.0 million for SSE re-allocated to MLE sector.
9)    Closing Date:  Date for final disbursement was extended several
times to synchronize with extensions of commitment dates.

Comments on Proiect Timetable:
1)    Identification/Preparation:  Issues raised in the project brief
were as follows:
(a)   DBM to re-examine its strategy for meeting its general
development objective.
(b)   Replacement of expatriate Managing Director with a
Mauritian.
(c)   DBMs need to strengthen its promotional activities.
(d)   The elimination or reduction of interest subsidies to SSE.
(e) Concern over high level of arrears in DBM's loan portfolio.
(f)   Difficulties in implementing the MCB-RS under DBM V due to
perceived legal impediments and the easy availability of
local currency loans at modestly higher interest rates



- 22 -
without the foreign exchange risk associated with the
scheme.
(g)   The Bank also wanted to participate in a review of DBM's
proposed foreign exchange risk guarantee scheme.
2)    Appraisal Mission:  In view of the fact that policy issues were
being addressed under the SAL lending and the absence of major
institutional and project issues, the committee decided to waive
the yellow cover review.
3)    Negotiations:  Issues agreed during negotiations were:
(a) DBM was to prepare an operation strategy statement and action
plan, which was completed in December, 1984.
(b) SSE qualifying ceiling to be increased from Rs. 25,000 to Rs.
50,000 and the inclusion in the loan of US$300,000 to employ
consultants to carry out studies of the industrial and financial
sectors (TOR to be discussed). The status of DBM expatriate
Kanaging Director vis-a-vis a Mauritian Managing Director was
discussed. The position is still held by an expatriate.
4)    Board Approval:  The loan was approved as negotiated.
5)    Loan Signature:  Referring to the negotiations, the loan documents
were amended in respect of the qualifying limit increasing from
Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 50,000 for sub-loans to SSE, subject to GOM
increased guarantee coverage.
6)    Loan Effectiveness:  Final date extended to allow time for receipt
of documents which subsequently arrived sooner than revised date.
7)    Loan Completion:  Extended due to slow commitment of funds by DBM.
8)    Loan Closing:  DBM requests to terminate drawdowns and prepay
outstanding loan balance which carried interest at 11.6Z p.a.
Given that DBM was able to raise lower costing domestic resources,

Comments:
The study component was implemented fully and with timing slightly
ahead of appraisal estimate. Commitments under the MLE sector was slow
due to the loan high financial cost compared to other lines of credit
from CCCE, EIB, IDBI and local resources without foreign exchange risk.
The DBM effective 6/89 terminated disbursement and prepaid outstanding
balance.
