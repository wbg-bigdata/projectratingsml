PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
Loan 2298 COB for the Ouesso Wood Processing Project for US$12.136
million was approved on May 31, 1983 but did not become effective until almost
a year later on May 22, 1984. The loan was closed on June 30, 1988, 18 months
later than originally scheduled. An undisbursed balance of US$807 thousand was
cancelled.
Parts I and III of the PCR were prepared by the Industry and Energy
Division of the EMENA Technical Department (on behalf of the Industry and Energy
Division of the Occidental and Central Africa Department). Part II was prepared
by the Borrower. Pqrts I and III were sent to the Borrower for comments, but
no comments have been received.
This PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the
Loan Agreement, the Projoct Agreement, supervision reports, and financial reports
of the company.

OUESSO WOOD PROCESSING PROJECT
Loan 2298 COB
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
ObJectives
The main objective of the project was the establishment of an
integrated logging and wood-processing operation near Ouesso in northern Congo.
Also, under the project, studies were to be carried out on the ways and means
of ensuring successful integration of the Pygmy population of the Ouesso area
into the activities of the area. Upon completion of such studies, an action plan
was to be implemented by December 31,  1985,  based on the recommendations
emanating from such studies. Finally, technical assistance was to be provided
to the borrower's ministry responsible for water and forestry to strengthen the
unit responsible for planning new enterprises, conducting contract negotiations
with foreign investors, liaising with joint venture partners and monitoring both
the on-going operations in the forestry sector and the world market. The project
was expected to be completed by June 30, 1986.
Implementation Experience
The project was a joint venture between the Government of Congo and
two private companies, La Societe Agro-Finance S.A.from Luxembourg and La Societe
les Sllna dii Sud-Oua;t  The connpany La Scite" Congolaisc dea sBois de Ouesso
(SCBO) was established for the project. The Government holds 51Z equity with
Agro-Finance having 145Z and Silos the remaining 42. The financial weakness of the
two private partners was of some concern and proved to be a major problem during
implementation as they were unable to provide additional equity funding to
compensate for increased costs.
The project was not successful and was stopped before completion due
to increased costs and the lack of financing to meet these costs. There are a
number of important contributing factors for this performance.
*     Inadequate provision for the high cost of transport.   It was
recognized during appraisal that the project is in a remote location
and highly susceptible to increases in transportation costs both on
the river and r$Alway.   In fact, costs of transport increased
markedly during the implementation period resulting first, in sharp
increases in plant and equipment costs, which almost doubled from



those used in the appraisal report, and second in lower log export
prices netted back to Ouesso.
*     Lac  of technical expLrience of the operating partners. At the time
of appraisal the lack of experience in the tropical timber business
by the partners of SCBO was noted. It was stated that this would be
obtained through recruitment and the retainment of a consulting
engineer. On hindsight the persons recruited and the chosen
consulting engineer did not have the necessary expertise to fill
this gap. Consequently the logging operations, which were to have
provided a source of project financing operated at a loss,
precipitating the financial collapse of SCBO. It is important to
note that since changing the operational management in January 1987,
the logging operations are now reported to be operating profitably.
*     Inappropriate  technology in project design.   From information
contained in the files there is some doubt whether the structural
designs adequately considered the utilization of local building
materials rather than materials which were imported and/or
transported from the coast. Reductions in construction costs and a
reduced implementation period could have been achieved with more
attention in this area.
*     Lack of a technical focus during Bank supervision.  Successive Bank
supervision missions focussed on the financial problems of SCBO and
devoted considerable attention to seeking financial solutions. In
fact the financial problems frequently were a result of technical
problems (unprofitable logging operations, escalating construction
costs, etc) and there appears to have been inadequate atLention paid
to seeking technical solutions to these problems.
*     Lack of Bank attention to critical aspects of procurement.  The loan
agreements gave the Bank the right to review all aspects of the
project, including procurement for goods and services not being
financed by the Bank.  However, there appears to have been very
litUle input by the Bank into the selection of the consultants, the
evaluation of equipment packages and the selection of the turnkey
contractor for the equipment or into the budgeting and cost control
aspects of the proiect.   This troiect clearlv illustrates the
importance  of  having  the  appropriate  experience  in  project
management and operating teams.   Even major industrial forest
c=_panies have had to learn new methods and techniques when moving
into projects in the tropical countries.
From the foregoing it appears that the potential for most of the
problems was foreseen at the time of appraisal, but that inadequate safeguards
were included in the project design to address them, or they were not properly
dealt with during implementation.
The project has obviously not achieved the desired objectives. The
partly-built industrial complex has been mothballed until conditions prove



- vii -
favorable and a private company can be found to take over the SCBO operations and
complete the construction. In the meantime, SCBO is completing the sawmill to
the extent where it will be able to saw some of the lower grade logs arising from
the logging operations.

Subsector                :  Forest Industries
2.    Background
2.01        The project, which was appraised in 1982, was a direct result of the
Government's derire to promote the economic development of northern Congo in
general, and the wood-processing industry in particular.   For several years
leading up to the project, the Bank had supported the Government in its efforts
to promote such development.   Specifically,  after a project identificaticn
mission in 1976, the Bank agreed, in 1978, to help finance feasibility studies
for a forestry and forest industries projeet in north-east Congo. These studies
led to the appraisal of the US$47.0 million project described below.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.01        Project Objectives:   The project was to support the Government's
efforts to expand logging and wood processing in northern Congo. The project was
also prompted by the need to seek alternative sources of logs to replace those
from the heavily exploited south. The Ouesso wood processing project provided:
(a)   the operation of a 1.1 million hectare forest concession, from which
100,000 cubic meters (in) of logs would be extracted annually, of
which 41,500 in would be exported and the rest processed to produce
sawnwood and veneer.
(b)   wood processing facilities designed to produce 23,000 le per year of
sawnwood and 4,200 ma per year of sliced veneer, most of which would
be exported;



(C)   industrial servicts facilities including shops, stores and a waste
wood fired power station to produce electricity (2.4 MW) and steam
(27 tons per hour) for the processing opevations;
(d)   a townsite accommodating over 500 people and equipped with a ctandby
diesel electric power station, kitche.   social facilities and a
clinic; and,
(e)   technical assistance components, including:  (i) commissioning and
training services; (ii) studies on the ways and means of ensuring
successful integration of the Pygmy population of the Ouesso area
into the activities of the area; and, (iii) asssstance to the
ministry responsible for water and forestry in order to strengthen
the unit responsible for planning new enterprises, conducting
contract negotiations with foreign investors, liaising with joint
ventare partners and monitoring both the on-going operations in the
forestry sector and the world market.
4.    Proiect Design and Organization
4.01        The Ouesso wood-processing project was designed mainly to expand
logging and wood processing in northern Congo.   The types of industrial
development examined included sawmills and plants to produce sliced veneer,
peeled veneer and plywood. Various plant capacities and design were explored and
the volume of logs was adjusted to match the extent of domestic processing and
annual output from the concession.   The project was based on a well proven
technology already in wide spread use in West A,.rica combining logging, log
export, sawmilling and veneer production.   Commercial timber companies were
successfully operating in the area and the same restrictions applied to them as
to the SCBO venture.
4.021    hz project implementatior. concopt of u "turn!hey equipment
supplier for the processing complex with an overall consulting engineer
responsible for the civil and structural design as well as overall project
management on behalf of SCBO was sound. However, the consulting engineer chosen
as project manager appears to have had little experience in tropical forestry
industry or indeed in the wood processing industry in general. The turnkey
eqaipment package supplier,  COFRAM, was comprised of a number of smaller
equipment companies from Europe and Canada. Surprisingly, some of the better
known equipment suppliers in the industry did not appear in the bidders' lists.
4.03        At the time of appraisal, SCBO's management team included:  (i) the
President who was alsi the Minister of Water and Forests of Congo; (ii) the
Director General, a French agricultural engineer with a doctorate in economics
and five years experience in project management for the State Planning Agency in
Algeria, followed by five years experience as a management consultant; and
(iii) the Deputy General Manager, a Congolese national who had held previous
posts as Director General of the State Cement Plant and Minister of Transport and
Housing.



- 3 -
4.04        In retrospect it is clear that organization weaknesses contributed
to the failure of project implementation, The pzrtnerb and the members of the
management team lacked the extensive experience Sn loggein and wood proress fnz
that would nonmally be considered necessary to assure the successful
imple'nentat.ion of such a project in such a difficult operating environment.
Also, the capital base of the foreign partners was very small relative to the
overall cost of the project, suggesting that they might have had difficulty
meeting any unforseen needs for increased equity contributions during the
implementation of the project.
4.05        The financing package included some 162 of the financing arising from
cast generated in the logging operations. The subsequent inefficient logging
operations due to management deficiencies resulted in the logging operating at
a loss and a subsequent drain on project funds. Although increased freight costs
played a substantial role in the failure of the project, thf lack of experience,
financial weakness of the SCBO private partners and poor management of the
operations and the project are seen as the main factors leading to the collapse
of the project.
5.    Project Implementation
5.01        Loan Effectiveness and Prolect Start-up:  Although Loan 2298-COB was
approved on May 31, 1983, it did not become effective until oue year later due
to delays in executing the Subsidiary Loan and Commercial Shareholders Agreements
and finalizing the financing plan.
5.02        Implementation Schedule:  The project was originally scheduled to be
complete by June 30, 1985. The implementation schedule included a number of key
milestones,  whose projected dates are shown below along with the actual dates.
Projected      Actual
Item                                          Date           Date
Completion of Financing Arrangements           9/83           9/84
Initial Payment to Turnkey Contractor          9/83           9/84
Placement of Equipment Orders                  9/83           9/84
Initial Payment to Civil Works Contractor   12/83            11/85
Start-up of Sawmill                            3/85       not realized
Start-up of Veneer Plant                       6/85       not realized
5.03        As indicated above, there were significant slippages in the schedule,
culminating with the bankruptcy of the turnkey contractor in August 1988 and the
demobilization of its subcontractors by the end of 1988, at which time only part
of the equipment had been installed and none of it was operational. The main
reasons for the delays were:



- 4 -
(a)   the isolated location of the project site and the underestimation of
the logistical difficulties associated with the delivery of
equipment from Brazzaville to Ouesso by river transport;
(b)   more than 20 months of delays in clearing imported equipment through
Customs as a result of a dispute arising from whether or not the
project was eligible for preferential import duty rates;
(C)   slow start-up in the procurement and award of the civil works
contract;
(d)   SCBO's  financial  difficulties  and  inability  to  implement  the
original financing plan; and,
(e)   a suspension of disbursements on all loans to Congo in September
1984 which severely impaired the ability of the turnkey contractor
which barely avoided bankruptcy when disbursements were resumed in
February 1985.
5.04        Capital Costs.  The estimated installed cost of the Ouesso wood-
processing project at appraisal, including working capital and interest during
construction was US$39.7 million equivalent and US$2.9 million for the technical
assistance component. The latest estimate available is about US$63.4 million as
shown in Annex 5 of Part III.  The increase in total cost cf about 57Z is mainly
made up of a 65Z increase in the cost of the plant equipment, a 47Z increase in
the cost of the forestry equipment and the doubling of working capital and IDC
costs. In reviewing the Bank's records there is little evidence available of
monitoring the factors which contributed to the increase in these costs. Little
is available on the actual design and operation of the logging activities or the
equipment packages.
5.05        Disbursements:  The estimated disbursements of the Loan 1228-COB are
shown in Table 3 of Part III. The disbursements were delayed due to delays in
project implementation and suspension of disbursements by the Bank during 1984.
The original closing date was extended from June 1986 to June 1988.
Disbursements against commitments were made through December 1988 and an
outstanding balance of US$0.8 million was cancelled on February 28, 1989.
5.06        Loan Allocation:  The original allocations and actual disbursements
for Loan 1228-COB are shown in Table 3 of Part III.
6.    Project Results
6.01        Project Obje-tives.   The project clearly has not yet met its
objectives. Though logging opeations continue, the main investment project,
construction of the wood processing complex, is incomplete and even if it was
completed it is nit clear whether it would ever be financially and economically
viable.



6.02        Physical Results.  Since the project has not been completed, the
physical targets of the industrial complex were not achieved.
6.03        Financial Performance. The financial reappraisal clearly showed that
it was more profitable to export logs than to precess them into lumber and
veneer. Had the processed logs been valued at their export price rather than at
their cost of production, it is likely that thie financial and economic analysis
would have shown the processing complex to be uneconomic.   The project as
appraised hid an implicit cross subsidy of the processing operations by the
logging operations.    However,  given that  the  rules  governing  the  forest
concession required the operator of the concession to establish processing
facilities and process 60? of the logs removed from the forest, such a base case
could not have been considered.
6.04        The inclusion of a sawmill in the project scope was justified since
in an operation of this nature there is a proportion of the logged volume which,
even under the closest scrutiny, will not yield logs of export quality a.nd would
either be wasted or have to be sawn locally. The regulated requirement for local
processing is both to realize greater economic benefit from the raw materials,
greater resource utilization and waste reduction. It was reasonable to assume
that 251 of the logged volume would not meet export log quality standards.
6.05        The major variances as shown in Section 6. of Part !II, expressed in
December 1987 FCFA, between the costs and prices used in the 1982 appraisal, and
those used in the December 1987 reappraisal include:
(a)   a 241 aecline in sales revenues due in part to the fact that the
FCFA appreciated from FCFA 340/US$ to 285/US$ while on a purchasing
power parity basis, it should have declined in value to FCFA
386/US$;
(b)   a 100? increase in the actual cost of producing logs;
(c)   a 262 increase in the estimated processing cost.
Similarly over the same period the capital investment costp have increased as
follows when expressed in US$:
(a)   plant and equipment increased by 64Z:
(b)   total financing requirements also increased by 64?.
6.06        At the original level of output, but using March 1990 selling prices,
expressed in December 1987 US$, the pr.ijected revenues from the complex would be
272 higher than estimated at the time of reappraisal. Tn other words they would
be Loughly equivalent, in real terms, to those estimated at the time of
appraisal.
6.07        Exchange rates have influenced the costs and revenues arising in the
project.   Revenue from the sale of logs is in Francs Communaute Financiere
Africaine (FCFA) which is pegged to the French Franc (FF) and has therefore



gained against other currencies along with the FF. Log prices are to a degree
dictated by the Dollar, Pound Sterling, Dutch Guilders, German Mark and the
French Franc along with other currencies. This influence arises not only from
the log trade but from the trade in tropical sawnwood, veneers and plywood.
7.    Project Sustainabilia
7.01        As discussed above the outlook  for the project  as originally
conceived was not good.  The logging operation, under the new management is
expected    be financially viable provided it does not have to service the debt
burder  c    lated by SCBO.  The longer term viability of the logging operation
will F.;      su3ceptible to increased transport costs and delays in transport
which '  Oen.  past has caused increased working capital requirements.   If
conditia  i. ,rove sufficiently to warrant completion of the processing complex,
then the pro-.:sion of experienced efficient management would be paramount to the
successful oreration of the project.
7.02        Increasing pressure by conservation and environmental groups is
having an impact on tropical hardwood markets. Attention needs to be given to
authenticating the forest management principles under which the logging is being
carried out in order to satisfy the contractual requirements under which
increasing volumes of tropical hardwood will be purchased.
8.    Bank Performance
8.01        The identification, preparation and appraisal of the project were
reasonably well handled. The project was based on technology well proven in West
Africa. However, considering that the industrial complex would be processing
logs rejected as export quality, sawn recovery rates used during the studies were
somewhat optimistic.
8.02        Although supervision missions visited the project after approval, it
seems that insufficient attention was paid to the technical aspects of the
project. In the f4les, there is little evidence that. the substantial increases
in plant and equipment costs were adequately evaluated. Also, there does not
appear to have been any attempt to focus on the losses incurred in logging and
loe exnort overations, which resulted in the rapid deterioration of SCBO's
financial position and contributed to their inability to implement the financing
plan.
8.03        Bank supervision reports indicate a preoccupation with the financial
aspects of the project with little attempt to look at the technical causes of the
deteriorating financial position. In future projects of this nature, the Bank
should monitor both the technical and financial aspects and provide assistance
in correcting any areas where the project deviates substantially from two
appraisal parameters.



-7-
8.04        The lack of experience with similar operations by SCBO and the
project  consulting  engineers, TEKHNE,  was another  factor which may  have
contributed to the escalation in costs.  The Bank reviewed proposals for the
selection of the consulting engineer but there is no evidence that the Bank
influenced the final selection. In future projects of this nature, the Bank
should have the right to participate in technical decisions and in the assessment
and selection of consulting engineers and equipment suppliers, which are critical
to the success of the project.
8.05        In sum, the main factors contributing to the failure of the project
are the following: (a) the financial weakness of the private partners in SCBO;
(b) deficiencies in the management structure of SCBO; and (c) project cost
control. As noted earlier, since logging profitability has improved with new
management, it is fair to assume that if this problem could have been detected
and corrected earlier, the project might have had fewer financial difficulties.
In future operations, if the company implementing the project is suspected of not
having the necessary expertise, the Bank should ensure that this experience is
provided through the appointment of a consulting engineer with strength in the
required fields.  This should cover not only design but training and initial
operations, as well.
9.    Borrower Performance
9.01        In this project the problems arose not with the Government of Congo
who was the primary borrower but with the sub-borrower, SCBO. SCBO is a joint
venture partnership between the Government and two private investment groups.
The financial strength of the private partners was limited and they were not able
to provide additional equity capital as required resulting in the virtual
bankruptcy of SCBO.   Furthermore,  the sub-borrower's lack of expertise in
tropical timber was a serious weakness which led to unsatisfactory results.
9.02        Prior to implementation, SCBO indicated that they were recruiting
management and operational staff as well as consulting engineers with more
appropriate experience than appears to have materialized during implementation.
In general, project management during the implementation of the project does not
appear to have been adequate especially in the assessment and control of the
plant and equipment packages.   The available documentation for the project
appears to be lean, especially considering the difficulties which arose.
10.   Bank/Borrower Relationship
10.01       Changes in the economic environment clearly affected the attitude of
the parties to this contract (on the investment side, the project almost doubled
in cost, due to extensive delays in obtaining approvals which were exacerbated
by the remoteness of the site and eventually by the fact that Bank disbursement
was cancelled). The investors neither had the management depth nor the financial
strength to adjust to these events. Moreover, as noted elsewhere in the report,
sales never attained projected levels, and the 16? cash required from operations
for investment never materialized. The Government argues in Part II that even



in the absence of cost overruns, the project was over-dimensioned.   It was
difficult to foresee this at the time of appraisal, but all parties agreed on the
project design at that time.  It is clear that with heavy overruns and sales
projections that failed to materialize, the project would not have had an
acceptable rate of return. In Part II, it is also suggested that if several
logging operations fed their production into the project facility, it could
conceivably become profitable. The feasibility of this was not tested, and the
partners and Government have not made any attempt to justify the assertion. The
Bank proposed mothballing, which implied that if economic conditions improved,
financing was available, and suitable ownership and management in place, the
plant might be completed eventually. GivexA the circumstances, the Bank's view
that the project was unlikely to be profitable appears justified. On the issue
of funding mothballing, the files indicate that the Bank would disburse against
the costs of mothballing, but it was never stated or written that it would
finance more than the disbursement percentage foreseen in the Loan Agreement,
which at 90X was already very high.
11.   Consulting, Contracting and Suppliers Services
11.01       The project was prepared primarily by competent consultants and the
level of the work was of a good standard.
11.02       Implementation involved the use of consulting engineers for the
design and construction management of the civil and structural aspects of the
project, as well as overall project management. The selected consultants had
little experience ia the wood processing industry and it showed.   From the
limited available information, structures appeared to be over designed for their
purpose and did not appear to take into account the utilization of local building
materials to the extent possible given the cost of getting other materials to the
remote location of the project.
11.03       The supplier/contractor of the turnkey equipment suffered from the
delayed payments by SCBO and eventually filed for bankruptcy prior to shipping
several major pieces of equipment from Europe. The limited information available
on the turnkey equipment at the time of preparing thiE PCR did not permit an
assessment of the processing design concept or the equipment supplied. The
turnkey supplier did not include any of the better known major international
suppliers. In 1985 a Bank supervision mission recognized that the contractor was
not fulfilling its role and that SCBO and TEKHNE were undertaking some of the
contractors duties. All these factors have been overshadowed by the Company's
financial problems and it is difficult to see who bears most of the blame.
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.01       The legal agreements for the project appear to cover adequately all
aspects of the project. How-aver, based on information obtained from the project
files, several requirements in the agreements do not appear to have been followed
up with respect to the evaluation of suppliers packages and other contracts.



12.02       The Staff Appraisal Report clearly defined the project and identified
areas of risk which actually contributed to the collapse of the project.  It
indicated the measures to be taken to guard against these potential problems.
From subsequent documentation, however, it appears that these measures were
either not fully implemented or not appropriately implemented.
12.03       Most of the data was readily available for the preparation of this
Project Completion Report.   However, no data could be found on the turnkey
equipment package design or on capital costs. Similarly, information could not
be found on the design and operation of logging. As would be expected given the
composition of the supervision missions, extensive aocumentation is available
relating to the financial situation.
13.   Lessons Learned
13.01       The main lesson to be learned from this operation is that the
complexities of implementing a project of this nature in a remote location make
it imperative that the parties involved have financial stretigth, technical
competence and management experience and skills.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART II: COMMENTS BY THE BORROWER ON PROJECT DESIGN AND EXECUTION
1.    Evaluation of Bank Performance Dur4ng Project Design; Lessons to be Drawn.
1.01        The basic error of donors and shareholders was to agree to the
construction of so large a complex on the basis of a feasibility study by the
Jaakko Poyry Company that turned out to be completely unrealistic.
Despite the optimism resulting from favorable economic circumstances
in 1983 (high oil prices and dollsr), it is unjustifiable to spend about US$36
million for an oversized industrial complex, when an adjacent company, the
Congolaise Industrielle des Bois, whose major shareholder is the H. Feldmeyer
Group, can build a plant of appropriate size, both as regards to the legislation
in force and in terms of technical requirements, for the sum of US$7 million.
The difference in cost between the two facilities cannot be explained
and the additional cost of the SCBO complex cannot be recovered.
2.    Assessment of Bank Performance During Project Execution.
2.01        With the project facilities started up substantially behind schedule,
it should have been clear that the closing date, June 30, 1986, was unreaLlstic.
The delay was attributable to the State partner, and was related to the time
taken to obtain the signatures for the agreement to establish the company,
guarantees, etc.
2.02        Once the project had started up, World Bank disbursements were
satisfactory. There are no criticisms to make regarding the administrative and
financial execution of the project.
2.03        The  logging  component  of  the project was  based  on  the  same
feasibility study, and was regarded as a financial operation by the partners, who
did not have forest operations experience.   The same mistakes of optimistic
planning quickly led to the virtual bankruptcy of the company once its capital
had been exhausted and its borrowing potential used to the maximum. This was the
background to the IBRD mission's aide-memoire of September 20, 1986, requesting
that the borrower take steps to correct the situation.
2.04        The administrative execution of the project and technical oversight
were both satisfactorily handled by the consulting engineer, Mr. Leclef (TEKHNE
Company), whose work was also financed by the Bank.



- 11 -
2.05        The lesson for the future is that this kind of project requires
greater participation by private shareholders right from the beginning.
3.    The Relationship between the Borrower and the Bank.
3.01        Although the Bank's administrative performance was satisfactory, it
is impossible to render as positive a verdict as regards "case management.'
3.02        It ts understandable that the major changes that occurred in the
Bank's internal organization at the beginning of 1987 may have disrupted the
supervision of ongoing projects, but the fact remains that this created
additional difficulties for borrowers. To find the newly responsible personnel
and their offices in the labyrinth of the Bank was a task of epic proportions,
and their knowledge of the project was as poor as that of the new SCBO
management.
3.03        Delays in replies caused by slow decisions, greatly handicapped the
project, to the point where in March 1987 our Legal Adviser, Mr. Schott, had to
warn the Bank of legal proceedings.  Given the consequences entailed by this
situation; the subcontractor continued to build the plant without any guarantee
of payment.
3.04        It is difficult to accept, as good management, a decision, (based on
a report by a reappraisal mission) to interrupt project which was 902 completed
by blocking the balance of the loan, without giving the Borrower the chance to
study the report and register its possible disagreement with its conclusions.
3.05        The excessively legalistic approach of the Bank also had negative
effects. After agreeing to finance, from the funds still available, "mothballing
expenses' not originally included in the Loan Agreement, these were reduced by
10 on the grounds that the Loan Agreement provided for 90Z financing. Since the
change was the result of a decision by the Bank, it should have financed the
total amount, rather than increasing the company's difficulties by only financing
90z.
3.06        Cancellation of a jointly reached decision to send a new mission to
study the profitability of the project is also unusual.   As far as SCBO is
pnnrprned. even the title of this document, i.e., "Project Completion Report",
is incorrect, since the project is not completed.  The decision to send this
mission was taken at the meeting in Washington in November 1988, but was canceled
by a message to the Minister of Forest Operations at the beginning of 1989.
Subsequently, an IBRD delegation accepted the principle of a mission at the end
of 1989 but nothing has happened.
3.07        There should be no doubt about the consequences of the World Bank's
decision to cancel the undisbursed balance and close the loan. It seems that the
World Bank has no interest whatever in the completion of the project, but is
interested in preparing a "final report" in order to close the file, on the
project.
3.08        However, there are still unresolved issues, including the resulting
debts of Congo and the commitments made by other financials BIAO and BDEAC.



- 12 -
SCBO, through this report, wishes to know the World Bank's position
regarding the real completion of the project. This decision can only be taken
after an on-site study to assess the present situation.
3.09        The futures It is now vital not to waste this huge investment, which
has produced a large complex of considerable technical value, though it exceeds
the needs of SCBO alone. The plant could become an efficient processor of logs
for the entire Northern Congo if the Government keeps open the option of inviting
neighboring companies (SFAC, SOCALIB and others) to help supply the plant with
raw material rather than build yet more plants.
3.10        Indisputably, the project will have a significant effect on the
Congo's economy and on the development of Northern Congo. Efforts must now be
made to ensure this outcome, since market projections indicate that the complex
should be profitable, after rehabilitation, in the near future.
4.    Performance of Cofinancing Organizations
4.01        The two other cofinancing organizations BIAO and BDEAC have settled
their commitments.

Comments
Financial constraints of the private partners gave rise to serious cash flow
problems which resulted in frequent supervision missions beginning late 1.984,
the suspension of loan disbursements for some 5 months and the subsequent
collapse of the prime contractors and the project before completion. The Re-
appraisal mission indicated that the viability of the project under the
changed financial conditions was highly dubious and recommended thaf the
project be mothballed until a private company wes found tn take over the

operations. The final part of the loan, as illustrated in the following
section was cancelled and the loan completed as indicated, some three years
later than the original estimated closing date.

6. Project Results
A. Direct Benefits
This project has not been successfully completed. SCBO encountered serious
financial difficulties early in the project. Reappraisal of the project in
November 1987 indicated that SCBO's prospects for achieving a reasonable
level of profitability were not promising due to increased log prices and
transportation costs as well as decreased product prices in real terms since
appraisal of the project in 1983. SCBO started logging in their concession in
the Ouesso area of Northern Congo in early 1983 under controlled forest
management criteria. Export logs are transported some 500 km by river to
Brazzaville and then transhipped by rail to Pointe Noire for loading on board
ship. At the time of appraisal freight was identified as a problem area
accounting for 20? of the projects capital cost and almost 50? of the cost of
the products FOB Pointe Noire. At reappraisal, it was estimated that 37? of
the selling price was accounted for by transport costs with a further 22? of
being absorbed by various taxes. After reappraisal it was recommended that
construction be halted and the plant be mothballed and a private firm be
sought to take over the company and operate it. As the IBRD loan was
initially aimed at covering the cost of structures and supervisory
engineering services the intended results of the project have not been
realized. Funds established for studies have been utilized to provide working
capital for SCBO. Hence a proposed study of the pygmy population has not
materialized and the betrefits to them from the existing operations not
determined.
With new management in place the production and export of logs is expected to
generate a positive cash flow. This provides income to the local population
in Ouesso, transport volumes and income to the river and rail companies as
well as foreign exchange earnings.

Comments:
Construction of the processing complex is about 80Z completed in terms of
expenditures. To complete construction, SCBO would require US$ 5.6 million in
funds plus an estimated US$ 12.2 million to cover the working capital
requirements and start-up costs during the initial three years operation.
It has been reported that the sawmill as currently designed and largely
installed would not be capable of processing the volume of sawlogs indicated
in the reappraisal report and in the above analysis. From the available
information obtained on the equipment package supply and reflecting the fact
that it would be processing lower quality logs with high rot and defect then
the above reappraisal estimates must be considered highly optimistic.
The IBRD 1can was intended primarily for funding the civil and structural
components and overall project management consulting engineers. As such the
Bank does not appear to have received drawings relating to the mechanical
lavout of the sawmill or any of the design capacity calculations.
The processing of logs into sawntimber and veneer does not appear to present
an economically attractive option. The high level of direct taxes imposed on
the operations severely reduces the financial viability.

Purpose as Defined at Appraisal:
The purpose of the study was to develop the first phase of a tribal
component designed to ensure that all inhabitants of the area affected by the
project, in particular those having the characteristics of tribal people as
defined by the Bank's 3MS 2.34 will be able to participate in the benefits
arising from the forestry development.
Status of Study:
The study has not been commissioned under the project.
Impact of Study:  None
Reports: Analysis of Offers for Civil Works by Tekhne S.C.
Progress Reports on Project by Tekhne S.C.
Financial Situation of the Project by Tekhne S.C.
Purpose:
Tekhne S.C. were consulting engineers appointed to act on behalf of
SCBO in preparing the specifications and supervising construction of the
civil and structural works. The analysis and progress reports were intended
as tools to monitor the project. The financial situation report in November
1987 highlighted the outstanding demands for payment.
Study: Financial Accounts for SCBO, December 1986
Purpose: To establish the financial position of SCBO. Provided financial
statements for the years 1985 and 1986.
Study: Complexe Industrial de la Sangha, Etude Previsionelle Sur 5 Ans
by HSD Helios, Membre D'Arthur Young International, Brazzaville
Purposes To evaluate the feasibility of establishing a new company to
purchase the industrial complex from SCBO. The new company,to be called
Complexe Industriel de la Sangha would include SCBO and two other companies
with large forest concessions in the same area. A letter of agreement was
signed between the parties indicating interest in the company. The proposal
was to find an experienced private sector group to rent and operate the plant
and purchase logs from all three partners.
Status of the Studys
The study was completed in November 1987.
Impact of the Study:
The study has been used to attract potential private sector operating
groups. To date no acceptable offers have been forthcoming.

7. Status of Covenants
Covenant                      Subject
1.    During the term of the loan SCBO will maintain a debt/equity
ratio not greater than 67:33.
Status
This covenant was not adhered to due to the deteriorating
financial situation of SCBO and increased equity from the
private sector partners not forthcoming. Part of the
financing was to arise from the profit on logging which did
not materialize and SCBO were forced to draw upon working
capital funds to pay outstanding debts.
Covenant                  Subject
2.    During the term of the loan SCBO would from project completion
onwards maintain a current of at least 1.3:1.
Status
As project has not achievee completion this covenant did not
arise.
Covenant                  Subject
3.    During the term  of the loan SCBO would not declare any
dividend nor pay any interest or principal on subordinated
debt before project completion.
Status
Principal and interest payments were made to commercial banks
and others during the course of the construction period. Bank
was fully aware of SCBO's financial status and these payments
throughout the lif- of the loan.

Comments
The demand on bank resources has been quite high due to the financial
problems arising with SCBO and the extensive formulation period for the
project and subsequent delays during implementation. On hindsight
possibly inadequate attention was paid to the design and operational
management of the logging operations. Similarly little attention appears
to have been devoted to the factors contributing to the substantial
increase in the capital costs related to the manufacturing complex.
There appears to have been little experience in SCBO relating to the
design and operation of tropical timber operations. TEKHNE, the overall
project management engineers, acting on SCBO's behalf, had very limited
experience in tropical forestry and forest industries. Technical
experience relating to tropical forest industries was very limited in
the Bank supervisory missions. As a covenant to the loan, the Bank
should have included the right to review the overall project concept,

the proposed design and selection of equipment for logging and timber
extraction as well as the proposed equipment packages for the processing
complex.
