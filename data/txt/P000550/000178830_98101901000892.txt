I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the People's Republic of the Congo (the Government),
has requested a Bank loan of US$12.0 million to help finance the development of
a new forest exploitation and wood-processing complex (the Project), at Ouesso
in northern Congo (Map IBRD 16576).  US$10.5 million of the proceeds of the
proposed loan would be onlent by the Government to the Company executing the
Project. The remainder would be used to finance technical assistance to the
Government, to ensure successful regional integration of the Project, and to
promote local capacity for efficient liaison with foreign joint venture partners
and for project supervision.
1.02      The Project will be owned and operated by a company created for this
purpose, La Societe Congolaise des Bois de Ouesso (SCBO). SCBO was established
in Brazzaville in November 1981, as a joint venture between the Government
(51%), La Societe Agro-Finance (Agro-Finance) of Luxembourg (45%), and La
Societe Les Silos du Sud-Ouest (Silos) of France (4%).
1.03      The proposed Bank loan to the Project would cover about 26% of its
financing requirement of US$40.0 million, and about 34% of its total direct and
indirect foreign exchange needs of US$31 million equivalent. Co-financing has
been secured from the Saudi European Bank (SEB) (US$4.4 million equivalent),
suppliers' credits (US$7.8 million), and the Banque Nationale de Developpement
Congolaise (BNDC) (US$3.2 million equivalent). The balance of the total
financing required (US$13.7 million), would be covered by a combination of
subscribed capital (US$7.4 million), and retained earnings (US$6.3 million)
generated by the export of logs through the exploitation of the forest
concession from February 1983 onwards.
1.04      The Project will operate a 1.1 million hectare (ha) forest concession
near Ouesso, from which it will extract 100,000 cubic meters (m3) of logs
annually. About 41,500 m3 will be exported directly, and the rest processed to
produce some 23,000 m3 of sawnwood and 4,200 m3 of sliced veneer, most of which
will also be exported. SCBO will provide direct employment for 540 people and
will indirectly support as many as 300 additional jobs in transport and
agriculture. Through the associated technical assistance components, Bank
participation in the Project will help to ensure rational social development in
the area as well as equitable distribution of the Project's benefits.
1.05      The Project is the direct result of the Government's desire to promote
the economic development of northern Congo in general, and the wood-processing
industry in particular. In pursuit of this objective, the country has received
the continuing support and interest of the Bank.  Specifically, after a project
identification mission in 1976, the Bank agreed in 1978 to help finance
feasibility studies for a forestry and forest industries project in Congo. The
proposed Project was identified as a result of these studies. To complement
them and to provide a framework for Government/Bank dialogue on the sector and
potential project participation, the Bank also undertook its own study of
Congo's Forestry Sector in July 1978. A reconnaissance mission visited Congo in
September 1981, and the Project was subsequently appraised, in April 1982. The
Bank mission consisted of Miss V.A. Bates of the Industry Department and
Messrs. A.J. Ewing and A. Hoben, Consultants. Further work on marketing
arrangements was later undertaken by Mr. R. Hyslop (Consultant).

II. THE WOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRY IN CONGO
A. The Industrial Sector
2.01      In 1982, about 54% of Congo's GDP is expected to come from the
industrial sector which also provides about 24% of employment. The oil industry
plays the dominant role, accounting for about 49% of GDP compared with 5% for
manufacturing and utilities. Oil is also expected to account for 84% of 1982
merchandise exports, with most of the remainder being other primary products
(agricultural and mineral). Manufactured goods such as sawnwood and veneer
represent less than 1% of the value of exports.
2.02      This economic structure represents a sharp change from that of the
mid-1960s when the local oil industry was insignificant, and industry,
agriculture (including forestry), and services each accounted for about 20% of
GDP. This change evolved as a result of a number of factors. Oil and potash
mining expanded rapidly from 1970-76, but declined in the next two years, due
primarily to extraction problems. At the same time, public sector industrial
intervention expanded significantly as the Government took over sugar and flour
milling, energy, ocean fishing, transport and petroleum distribution, and built
new facilities for cement, textiles, bottles (glass and plastic) and petroleum
refining. This change in ownership was accompanied by sharp declines in
production, as capacity utilization fell to 25-40%. TJnrealistic pricing and
employment policies compounded the companies' resultant financial difficulties,
to the detriment of both the national budget and the physical assets concerned.
GDP fell (by a total of about 7% in real terms from 1974-77) and the balance of
trade deteriorated to a deficit of CFAF 5.8 billion by the end of 1975.
2.03      From 1978-1980, the Government instituted a number of measures in an
attempt to remedy the country's grave economic situation: a stabilization
program was introduced; commercial and UNDP/ILO financing was obtained to
institute a public sector rehabilitation program, and to provide technical
assistance (managerial and financial) to such enterprises in general; an IMF
stand-by program was arranged; and the role of the public sector was reassessed
in favor of private sector (including foreign) management and investment
participation.
2.04      Meanwhile, as a result of rising oil prices and increased oil
production from new fields in Congo, in 1978 the economy picked up rapidly.
Between 1978 and 1980, GDP grew at a real annual rate of about 19%, although a
commensurate increase in external interest payments and repatriation of oil
sector profits reduced this to about 16% in terms of GNP. There was a parallel
improvement in the balance of trade, which from a CFAF 5.8 billion deficit in
1975, showed a CFAF 127 billion surplus in 1981. This is expected to increase
to CFAF 155 billion in 1982 (all in current terms).
2.05      The improvement in the nation's finances has had a dampening effect on
the Government's attempts to increase the efficiency of public sector
enterprises. However, in view of the uncertainties associated with the oil
sector, and the country's unhappy experience during 1975-78, the Government does
realise the need to diversify the economy, and this goal, as well as the need to
balance regional development, particularly in the north, is to some extent
reflected in the five-year development plan 1982-86. With a population of only



-3-
1.6 million, unevenly spread over an area of 340,000 km2, the scope for import
substitution is limited.  In the oil sector, a refinery which was constructed
(with major technical faults) in the mid-1970s and never operated, but which is
now being rebuilt, will start up in the mid-1980s. Apart from oil, Congo's main
natural resource is its forests. Construction of a US$700 million export market
pulp mill (with possible IFC participation) is under consideration for the late
1980s. In the nearer term, an expansion of logging and wood-processing,
particularly in the north, is a primary objective of the five-year plan, as well
as of the Government's general long-term development strategy, as detailed in
the following sections.
B. Forestry
2.06      Tropical hardwood forests cover about 21 million ha or 60% of Congo's
land area. Some 13 million ha, or 62%, are generally considered to be
commercially exploitable, with a potential annual sustainable yield (on a
20-year rotation cycle) of 2 million m3. Some 4.5 million ha with a potential
yield of 0.5 million mi, lie in the south where the commercial species are limba
on the coast, and okoume a few hundred miles inland.  These relatively
accessible forests have been exploited since the 1940s, and commercial species
in this region are rapidly becoming depleted. The northern region comprises
about 8.5 million ha, with a potential 1.5 million m3 annual sustainable yield.
This region is relatively inaccessible and thus has considerable unused
potential. Predominant commercial species are the redwoods, sapelli and sipo,
and ayous, a white wood. Two large (foreign) concession-holders have been
operating in the north since the mid-1970s; the only other significant
development is a former Romanian joint-venture, in the far northeast at Betou,
which because of equipment deficiencies never operated properly and was defunct
for several years until late 1982/83 when the Government contracted with
consultants to organize and manage its rehabilitation.
2.07      As a result of the decline in accessible resources, the sector's
contribution to the Congolese economy is less significant than it could be on
the basis of total available resources, and has been declining in recent years.
Between 1970 and 1975, forestry production declined by about 1% annually,
although since then, growth has been positive at an annual rate of about 8%.
Specifically, total Congolese log production fell from 751,000 m3 in 1972, to
310,000 m3 in 1975, but rose again to 527,000 m3 in 1981.
C. The Wood-Processing Industry
1. All Congo
2.08      The proportion of logs processed, however, has risen fairly
continuously, from 37% in 1972 to 57% in 1981. Local value added has thus been
increasing, and the nature of such processing has become more sophisticated.
The volume of logs and processed commodities involved are summarized in the
following table. Details are shown in Annex 2.

2.09      In 1982, thirteen sawmills, four peeled veneer plants, one sliced
veneer plant and one plywood plant were in operation in Congo. Many of these
operations are very small with only six processing more than 50,000 m3 of logs
annually. Four of these larger opetrations are foreign-owned, while two are
joint ventures between the Government and private foreign partners. The
proposed Project falls in the category of a joint state (51%) and private
foreign (49%) enterprise. Other existing public sector activity in the wood
processing sector is summarized below:

2.10      Although very little production data is available, the above public
and joint sector enterprises are characterized by unsatisfactory technical and
financial performance. As with almost all public sector enterprises in Congo
(para 2.02), they suffer to a greater or lesser extent from poor management and
maintenance, and capacity utilization is somewhat lower than the 60-65% national
average for the industry. In addition, performance is adversely affected
because: (a) all public sector activity to date is in the south or southwest of
the country where there are raw material shortages due to heavy past depletion
of existing concessions; (b) log deliveries are adversely affected by irregular
and unreliable rail services (now being upgraded in partially Bank-financed
projects);l and (c) those in the Pointe Noire region have been experiencing
regular power outages since 1977.
2. The North
2.11      These problems are less serious in the North, although only two of the
existing enterprises (Boissangha and Congolaise Industrielle des Bois--CIB, both
privately and foreign-owned) are located in that region. Both, like the
Project, are within the Sangha region. Boissangha at Kabo (about 50 km upstream
from Ouesso) is owned bD Lalande (France), operates a 280,000 ha concession, and
produced about 78,000 m of logs in 1981. Boissangha has had a sawmill in
operation since 1977, and produced 12,500 m3 of sawnwood in 1981. All
production is intended for Lalande's own consumption in France. As part of its
1/ Loan No. 1228-COB of 1976; and Loan No. 1047-COB of 1980.



expanded (1977-78) concession agreement, Boissangha has been building up its
production capacity in both logging and sawmilling. From 1986, annual
production will increase to approximately 37,500 m3 of logs and about 28,500 m3
of sawnwood, all for export.
2.12      CIB operations are centered in Pocola, about 45 km downstream from
Ouesso. The company also obtained an expanded concession agreement in the late
1970s and now controls 480,000 ha from which 65,000 m3 of logs were extracted in
1981. As part of its concession agreement CIB is required to establish a
sawmill with an eventual annual processing capacity of about 30,000 m3, on a
total log production of 100,000 m3. At present the company has a sawmill at
Brazzaville, with an annual capacity of 12,000 m3, of which 50% is for export
and 50% for local consumption. CIB is owned 100% by Feldmeyer of the Federal
Republic of Germany, and exports logs and sawnwood for Feldmeyer's internal
consumption. Construction of the new sawmill is scheduled to begin in 1984.
Boissangha and CIB are profitable as indicated by both companies' desire to
expand their concessions and to make additional investments.
D. Government Policies and Future Development
2.13      Forestry and the associated wood-processing industry has been a prime
vehicle in the Government's plans for Congo's economic development since the
early 1970s. A long-term Forestry Development Plan for 1973-84 was formulated,
and radically new forestry legislation (considered to be among the best in
tropical timber producing counties) was introduced in 1974. The basic
objectives outlined in this plan, namely: (a) developing Congolese human
resources; (b) increasing Congolese investment to control such entities, while
attracting sufficient foreign participation to ensure their technical and
economic success; and (c) increasing local participation in marketing, have been
reiterated in subsequent national plans and programs. Results however, have
been less than hoped for. The Office Congolais des Bois (OCB) established in
1975 to monopolize log export marketing has not substantially increased local
marketing capacity; foreign investment has been sluggish; and an OCB-managed
credit to state enterprises and small local producers to acquire logging
equipment has been unable to obtain repayment from many of the enterprises
concerned.  Technical assistance to OCB is ongoing (para 2.15); a price control
unit is being established in the Ministry of Water and Forests; and forest and
tax legislation is being revised.
2.14      The Government is also taking steps to promote further expansion of
the forest industry. Three Forest Management units have been demarcated in the
Sangha region around Ouesso, named the Unite Forestiere d'Amenagement (UFA) Est,
Centre and Ouest, respectively. A f'easibility study of the UFA Centre was
completed in early 1982, and a preliminary contract of intent to exploit this
concession was signed between the presidents of Algeria and Congo in April 1981
(the feasibility study is expected to provide a basis for negotiations). A
feasibility study of the UFA Ouest is now ongoing. Two industrial complexes fed
by two concessions in Likouala near Eneyele are also planned, for which
pre-feasibility studies are to be completed shortly. Finally, a new feasiblity
study of the now defunct Betou concession (para 2.06) is being implemented.
Having failed to identify a foreign partner to exploit this concession, the
Government is rehabilitating this operation on its own. If successful, all
these measures could double Congo's annual log production from 527,000 to over 1
million m3 within the next 8 to 10 years.

E. Bank Role and Involvement of Other Lending Agencies
2.15      To date, the Bank has not financed any projects in Congo's forestry or
wood-processing sectors. The IFC approved a US$3.5 million loan to Placongo
(para 2.09) in March 1981 to expand production capacity, but project
implementation was delayed as the company was unable to complete the financing
plan and incurred further losses as a result. In 1982, TFC approved a
US$200,000 equity participation in a promotional company aimed at establishing
an export pulp mill in Congo. The Bank has played an important role in the
development of the wood sector through PPF financing of the feasiblity study for
this Project (para 1.05) and is now providing technical assistance to OCB under
the River Transport Project approved in September 1981.2/ This Project as well
as the two Congo railway projects (para 2.10) will also play a crucial role in
relieving transport bottlenecks currently impending development of the wood
sector.
2.16      The Bank's role in the Ouesso Wood-Processing Project is a logical
outcome of the assistance provided through project identification and
preparation. More importantly, the Bank's influence through the technical
assistance components proposed will help to strengthen the capacity of the
Ministry of Water and Forests in all its forest industry activities, and will
help to ensure equitable social development in the Project area. Finally, by
helping to ensure the successful design and implementation of the first fully
integrated forest industries operation in Northern Congo, the Bank can
materially assist in setting an example which can be replicated by other
concession holders.
2.17      Other lending agencies have not to date played a significant role in
the development of Congo's wood-processing sector. However, as noted
previously, the Banque Arabe de Development des Etats Africains (BADEA) has
expressed an interest in financing the proposed Algerian joint venture in the
UFA Centre (para 2.14).
III. THE SPONSOR
A. La Societe Congolaise des Bois de Ouesso (SCBO)
3.01      SCBO, the project sponsor, was created as a joint sector company under
Congolese law on November 19, 1981, to exploit, transform and market wood and
wood products. The company is a legal entity, headquartered in Brazzaville,
with an authorized capital of CFAF 2.5 billion (US$7.3 million) in 100,000
shares. The Congolese Government holds 51% of the equity, La Societe
Agro-Finance (Agro-Finance, para 3.03) 45%, and La Societe les Silos du Sud
Ouest (Silos, para 3.04) 4%. CFAF 0.6 billion (25%) of this capital was paid in
by each shareholder proportionately, on November 19, 1981. Each partner
contributed a further 25%, bringing the total to CFAF 1.25 billion, during
July 1982, and a third quarter is now in the process of being called in.
Direction of the company is assured by a six-man board of directors, of which
three (including the President) are nominated by the Government, two by
2/ Loan No. 1179-COB.



-8-
Agro-Finance, and one by Silos.  This Board, endowed with powers as outlined in
the company's statutes, takes decisions based on a majority. In case of a tie,
the President holds the deciding vote. Day-to-day management is exercised by
the Director General and his Deputy.
3.02      The President of SCBO is S.E.M. Henri Djombo, Minister of Water and
Forests. The Director General is Mr., J.C. Castillo, a French agricultural
engineer with a doctorate in economics, and five years' experience in the
management of project implementation, from planning through start-up, for the
State Planning Agency in Algeria, followed by five years as a consultant in
management systems, company restructuring, etc. for Silos (including three
projects in Congo, para 3.05). The D)eputy Director General of SCBO is Mr.
Jean-Jacques Ontsa-Ontsa, a Congolese national who was previously Director
General of the state cement plant and, prior to that, Minister of Transport and
Housing. Further details on operational management of SCBO are provided in
paras 5.31-5.32. These appointments are appropriate for the level of experience
and expertise required, and with the technical assistance foreseen (paras
5.33-5.34), are expected to be adequate to ensure the successful implementation
and operation of the Project. In addition, and to ensure that management
integrity is preserved, the Government has provided assurances that, regardless
of majority shareholding, it (the Government) will take no action which would
prevent the Company from being run as an efficient, commercial enterprise.
B. La Societe Agro-Finance
3.03      Agro-Finance S.A. was established as a limited liability holding
company, under Luxembourg law, on September 2, 1981. The company has an initial
life of 30 years, and the objective of participation in local and foreign
enterprises including equity subscription, acquisition, the exploitation or
licenses and patents, and the provision of a variety of loans and guarantees.
With an authorised capital of US$1 million, 100% paid in on the date of
establishment, the company is 99.4% owned by the Societe Europeenne de Banque,
Luxembourg (SEDB, para 3.06). The company has a Board of Directors with at
least three members including the President, which may delegate day-to-day
operations to third parties.  The current President is Mr. Claude Deschenaux,
Managing Director of SEB. During a board meeting on November 17, 1981 the
members decided to subscribe to 45% of SCBO's share capital; as of December 31,
1981, this was Agro-Finance's only financing operation.
C. La Societe les Silos du Sud-Ouest (Silos)
3.04      Silos, the third and minority (4%) partner in SCBO is also the only
one with experience in establishing and operating agriculturally-based
processing activities in developing countries, albeit not in the timber
industry. The company was created as a partnership on August 27, 1956, to
assist medium-scale cereal producing cooperatives in the southwest of France to
maximize their marketing potential. It was transformed into a limited liability
company in 1957, and through a number of increases, now has an authorised and
fully paid in share capital of FF 10 million (US$1.5 million equivalent), of
which 70% is held by la Societe d'Equipements Agricoles et de Ventes Interagra
(SEAV INTERAGRA), 19% by la Societe IPI Trade International, and the remainder
by 10 individuals and companies, no one of whom owns more than 1%. The



- 9-
President and Managing Director of the company is Jean-Louis Doumeng, son of
Jean-Baptiste Doumeng, President and Director General of SEAV INTERAGRA. As a
subsidiary of SEAV INTERAGRA (an international trading group in agricultural
products, with close ties with the cooperative movement and a 1979 turnover of
US$1.5 billion), Silos has been delegated the role of developing and following
up group relationships in Africa. In 1979, Silos contributed US$50 million
(about 3%) to the group's revenues; 85% of this was generated outside France.
Indicators of Silos' financial performance in 1977-79 are shown below.
Silos - Summary of Financial Indicators
1977           1978           1979
Total Assets (FF million)   40.4            113.6           163.1
Revenues (FF million)         84.2          164.1           292.8
Net Earnings (FF million)    0.2              1.2             0.3

Debt:Equity Ratio            47:53           2:98           27:73
3.05      Silos is a successful and expanding organization with a satisfactory
financial position and a good credit rating. It is part of a group with an
equally substantial and generally favorable reputation. Silos' main objectives
are currently to assist developing nations (particularly in Africa) to produce,
stock, transport, and transform their agricultural resources from the
pre-feasiblity stage through to product "in hand", including financing and
long-term technical assistance, based on the transfer of well-established
technologies. In Congo, Silos has already assisted the Government to
rehabilitate a grain shipping facility, to establish a poultry complex at Pointe
Noire (with an annual capacity of 2,600 tons), and to install an electric power
line from Loudima to Pointe Noire. These projects are proceeding
satisfactorily. Silos is also involved in SILCO SA, a trading company for heavy
engineering equipment.
D. La Societe Europeenne de Banque (SEDB)
3.06      Although SEDB is not itself a shareholder in SCBO, it is the main
shareholder of the recently created Agro-Finance (para 3.03). SEDB was
established in Luxembourg, on June 2, 1976, with a capital of LF 250 million.
On December 13, 1979, this was increased to LF 400 million (about UTS$10 million
equivalent), fully paid in since October 14, 1980. Based on audited accounts
for 1980, as of December 31, SEDB had total assets of LF 15.4 billion (US$385
million), compared with LF 13.2 billion in 1979, and an average maturity of
outstanding credits of less than four years. SEDB has a staff of 31 and in
1980, managed or co-managed US$480 million equivalent of syndicated loans,
promoted a private placement of US$15 million, and increased short-term and
secondary euro-bond market operations as well as expanded services to private
and corporate clients. 1980 pre-tax profits were LF 83.9 million (US$2 million)
compared to LF 50.7 million in 1979.
3.07      With the backing of SEDB and SEAV INTERAGRA and the direct
involvement of Agro-Finance and Silos (led by the latter), the foreign
partnership in this Project would appear to offer the financial and business
standing and acumen, as well as the Congolese (and African) experience required
to bring the Project to a successful conclusion; although technical assistance



- 10 -
from third parties will be required in some areas (para 5.31). A Shareholders'
Agreement confirming that Silos and Agro-Finance will provide all of the
necessary resources and other assistance to SCBO required for it to fulfill its
undertakings with respect to the Project has been obtained.
IV. MARKETS AND MARKETING
A. The International Context
4.01       In 1980, world production of logs for processing into sawnwood and
veneer logs totalled about 842 million m3, of which 29% was hardwood, and half
of that tropical hardwood. Since 1961, tropical hardwood log production has
been increasing at about 3.6% a year, while production of temperate hardwood
logs has virtually stagnated, due to supply shortages in industrial nations.
Hardwoods are used primarily for making furniture and in construction
(joinery). Although fashion is a significant factor in some end-uses, tropical
and temperate hardwoods are often close substitutes, and in some cases softwood,
or even non-wood materials such as aluminum, cement, plastics or steel may
compete. According to the nature of the product, and the level of per capita
income, the income elasticity of demand for hardwood logs ranges from 0.5 (basic
products) to greater than one (high value, decorative products). Given the
slowdown in temperate hardwood production, the nature of its end use, and the
fact that almost all tropical hardwood production occurs in the developing
world, international trade in hardwood logs and associated products (veneer,
sawnwood) has increased rapidly over the past two decades, roughly doubling
since 1965, as shown in the following table.

4.02      As noted earlier, tropical hardwood accounts for about one half of all
industrial hardwood log production, and is playing an increasingly important
role in such production and trade. Although at present, about 80% of all
tropical hardwood log exports come from Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines,
all of these countries have recently taken steps to reduce such exports in order



- 11 -
to conserve resources, to augment economic benefits from their exploitation and
to increase local value added through the transfer of processing from the
industrialized world to their nations.  It will be some time before sufficient
processing facilities can be brought into operation to replace these logs with
sawnwood or veneer equivalents. The main existing producers in Africa (Ivory
Coast, Ghana and Nigeria) have virtually reached the limit of their potential;
and since untapped forests in areas such as the Amazon, Papua-New Guinea and
Central Africa are considerably less accessible and so more costly (by about
50-100%) to exploit, tropical hardwood is likely to be in short supply for at
least the next 15 years. Ilowever, in the short term, the world economic
recession (and particularly that of the construction sector of the
industrialized world) has resulted in a decline in consumption and concomitant
downward pressure on prices. Total tropical hardwood production and consumption
by region for selected years 1961-1980, and projected to 1995, are detailed in
Annex 4-1 and summarized below:

4.03      The above projections are based on estimated potential cut, and known
and anticipated capacity expansions in producing areas, assuming the type of
increase in real prices required to stimulate such production. On the demand
side, anticipated income growth and income and price elasticities have been
used, as well as potential changes in temperate hardwood supply. These
projections indicate that through 1995 tropical hardwood supply will be the
constraining factor in equilibrium international consumption.
4.04      The projections also show that as a result of the restrictions on log
exports, tropical hardwood production in Asia-Oceania will decline through to



- 12 -
1990, and increase only moderately thereafter. Meanwhile, world consumption
will continue to increase.  Under these circumstances, tropical Africa and Latin
America will play increasingly important roles in international tropical
hardwood trade. Given the high cost of transport in relation to product value,
particularly for logs, past trading patterns have tended to be governed by the
distance from producer to end-user. Thus Asian logs have largely been traded
within Asia, and African logs with Europe. For sawnwood and veneers, the
African products also go primarily to Western Europe; and those of Latin America
to North America. Asian tropical sawnwood and plywood/veneer, are more widely
distributed; they have long been shipped to Japan, Australia and North America,
but exports to Western Europe have been increasing because the supply of
preferred African woods has been unable to expand to meet growing demand. As
processed production of Asian tropical sawnwood expands after the mid-1980s,
such competition with African converted products in Europe may be expected to
increase. On the other hand the Japanese log market, partially vacated by its
former Asian suppliers, should provid,e increased opportunities for African
woods, at least in the short to medium term. In addition, although there is a
fair degree of substitutability between hardwoods in general, and tropical
hardwoods in particular, this is not normally the case for high-value decorative
species, each of which has very different characteristics that vary with the
region of origin, and even the country or area within each region.
B. The Role of West Africa
4.05       In a broad sense, Congo's forest species are similar to those of other
west and central African nations, particularly Cameroon, CAR, Zaire and Gabon.
Production, exports and apparent consumption (imports are negligible) for this
region in recent years are summarized below:

4.06      The above table indicates that for the region as a whole, while
production has been increasing steadily since 1965, domestic consumption has
also been increasing so that the exportable surplus has remained more or less
constant. Further increases in production have been constrained as accessible
areas have become depleted, and prices have not risen sufficiently, nor internal
infrastructure developed rapidly enough, to stimulate production from less
accessible regions. Among the individual countries in the region, Ivory Coast



- 13 -
accounts for about 40% of all exports, Gabon for a further 15%, and Cameroon for
9%.  Other countries including Liberia, Congo and Ghana account for between 3%
and 5% of regional exports. Nigeria, which was a significant exporter in the
past, is now a net importer.  Detailed statistics for those countries are
presented in Annex 4-2. Further expansion in most of these countries is
unlikely except, as in the case of Congo, where there are remote virgin forest
areas. The development of such areas will be necessary if supply projections
are to be met but this will involve significantly higher investment and
operating costs.
C. The European Market
4.07       The main market for West Africa is Europe.  For Congo, the most
important traditional purchasers have been: France, the Federal Republic of
Germany, Portugal, Italy, Spain, USSR, Netherlands and Romania (although Japan,
Argentina and Algeria are now beginning to play a role). Production, exports,
imports and apparent consumption of industrial hardwood by the EEC from
1965-1980 are shown in Annex 4-3 and, for indicative years, below:

4.08       Thirty to forty percent of the EEC's apparent consumption of
industrial hardwood logs, sawnwood and veneer is derived from outside the
region. Further, of total hardwood log imports in 1973 (8.8 million m3) 92%
were tropical hardwood. In 1979 and 1980, 71% of such imports were tropical.
For sawnwood, of 1973 hardwood imports of 4.8 million m3, 50% were tropical,
and in 1978 and 1980, 96%. This relative and absolute decline in tropical log
imports, and increase in imports of tropical sawnwood, reflects a progressive
increase in processing in the countries of origin; the total tropical roundwood



- 14 -
equivalent in 1973 of roughly 12.8 million m3 imported is comparable to that in
1979-80 of about 11.5 million m3.
4.09      As noted below (para. 4.20), the Government has asked the French
foreign partner (Silos) to assume responsibility for all export marketing for
the Project. In 1981, France imported 1.3 million m3 of tropical logs and 0.3
million m3 of tropical sawnwood; tropical veneer imports totalled 26,000 m3 out
of a total of 124,000 m3.  At full production, the Project's annual export
output, of 41,500 m3 of logs, 20,000 m3 of sawnwood and 4,200 m3 of sliced
veneer, will represent barely 1% of current EEC tropical log and sawnwood
imports, and a similar proportion of total veneer imports. For France alone,
the Project output is equivalent to atbout 3% of total tropical log imports, 6%
of tropical sawnwood imports, and 16% of tropical veneer imports. Clearly, in
terms of the Western European and even the French tropical hardwood market,
anticipated output from the Project will be of minor significance in relation to
the total, particularly when anticipated demand growth of about 1.4% a year
through 1995 is taken into account (total Project output would only account for
about 20% of one year's EEC growth).
4.10       Further, although ready markets can be found in Western Europe, Silos
(and the Congo) has rather close trading ties with Eastern Europe and the IJSSR,
and Silos has indicated that its marketing effort would primarily be directed to
that region. Total equivalent roundwood consumption in the region is currently
about 1.4 million m3 annually (including consumption for all centrally planned
economies), so that in this market also, the ou-tput from the Project would be a
relatively minor factor. Given the projected world-wide supply constraints, the
links between Silos and the countries of Eastern Europe, and the relatively
small volumes involved, it would appear that Silos could market all of the
output, if it wished, in this region.
D. The Domestic Market
4.11       The domestic market for sawnwood (the sole product that would be sold
locally) has averaged about 25-30,000 m3 annually since 1965, as indicated by
the following table:

4.12       Although these figures do not show a clear gap in the local market
which SCBO could hope to fill, the Project would have an advantage over many
existing producers by virtue of its location. There is only one sawmill in
Brazzaville (CIB - 12,000 m3 annual output), which sells about half its output
to the local market, and another in the north (Boissangha) that exports
virtually 100% of its output. All other mills are in the south. The plant
would therefore have an advantage selling to local consumers in Brazzaville, who
would otherwise have to transport timber by rail from Pointe 1Toire. In
addition, the oil-based expansion in economic activity since the late 1970s is
beginning to have a major stimulating effect on the construction sector: two
international grade hotels are now under construction in Brazzaville and CIB has
reported that there is sufficient demand to sell all its output from its
Brazzaville sawmill locally if it wished. From 1980-85, Congo's GDP is
projected to grow at about 11% a year, which, assuming a typical income
elasticity of demand for sawnwood of 1.0, would generate a similar rate of
growth in sawnwood consumption. One year of 10% growth in the sawnwood market
would be sufficient to absorb the anticipated local sales of the Project of
3,000 m3 annually.
E. Prices
1. Logs
4.13      The main species to be produced by the Project is sapelli (77.6% of
output). The Bank's Commodity Unit's May 1982 forecasts of the price for high
quality logs of this species, FOB Cameroon (a reference shipping point for log
prices), are shown in Annex 4-4 and summarized below:

Thus, after an average annual real price increase of about 4% from 1965 to 1980,
1982 prices were in real terms 23% lower than in 1981, and than was in fact
projected for 1982.  The Commodity Unit has not yet revised its forecast in the
light of this. However, given the circumstances outlined in the previous
paragraphs--basically declining avai;Lability and rising demand for tropical
hardwoods at trend prices--the Unit contends that the price increases remain
valid. For the purposes of the financial analysis contained in this report, the
long-term price forecasts have therefore been maintained. In the light of 1982
actual prices, the short-term price forecasts have, however, been changed as
described in the following paragraphs., Further, since the correlation between
movements in log prices and in those of the main products (sawnwood, veneers,
plywood) is close, it has been assumed that future changes in export sawnwood
and veneer prices will follow the trernds determined for logs.
4.14        For Congo, all log exports are handled by the Office Congolaise des
Bois (OCB). Every three months, OCB establishes FOB prices for the forty
different grades and species of logs it handles, based on information from its
own office in Brussels, from L'Institut de Conjoncture Europeen in Hamburg, and
from L'Institut des Statistiques Economiques in Paris. From this FOB price, OCB
then deducts handling and loading charges at Pointe Noire, taxes, and its own
profit margin (6%), to yield a list price per quality and species which is about
80% of the FOB price. This list price is paid to all producers of logs on
delivery to Pointe Noire.
4.15      The present GCB FOB price (published in January 1983) for the best
quality sapelli logs is US$167/m3 equivalent, which is similar to the reference
Cameroon price for the same quality logs for February 22, 1983 of
US$162-176/m3. The OCB list price for the actual species and average log
qualities to be exported has therefore been used to develop a base weighted
average sales price of logs for the financial analysis as shown below:

a/  For average quality logs expected from the Project.
Projections from this base price have been prepared using the percentages
derived from the Commodity Unit's forecasts mentioned above and modified as
described hereafter.  Since log prices appear to have bottomed-out in November
1982, and since generally some recovery in the international economy is
anticipated for 1983, by the end of the year it is assumed that African hardwood
logs will have regained their 1981 prices, in nominal terms, implying a nominal



- 17 -
price rise of about 20% (between December 1981 and December 1982 nominal prices
fell by 20%). It is further assumed that by 1986 real prices will have reached
the real price level originally projected by the Commodity Unit for 1985, (para
4.13) and that by 1990 (and thereafter) prices will have returned to this Unit's
real trend projections. In reality, as now, there will be fluctuations above
and below the trend, but it is beyond the scope of this report to project them.
The net result as shown in Annex 4-5 is a real price increase of 35% over the
entire period, 1983-1995, starting from the January 1983 price level.
2. Export Sawnwood
4.16       As with logs, sawnwood prices, are extremely depressed at present,
although real long-term price increases are forecast. No price series is
available for African woods, but the following series for Malaysian woods is
indicative. As can be seen, the increase projected from current price levels to
those anticipated for 1995, implys a real price increase of at least 35%. This
is the order of magnitude assumed for African log prices above, and which, as
explained in para 4.13, will be used for sawnwood and veneer prices for analysis
of this Project.

4.17       There is no common export marketing agency for sawnwood in Congo, nor
does the Bank keep track of African sawnwood prices. In November 1981, prices
FOB Pointe Noire were about CFAF 150,000/m3 for sipo, and CFAF 120,000/mr for
sapelli.  For February 1983, private sources indicate prevailing FOB prices,
Cameroon, were of the order of CFAF 98,000/m3 for Sapelli. For the mix of
species from the Project, this would normally imply a weighted average price of
roughly CFAF 89,000/m3 in February 1983. Assuming the same trend relationships
described above for logs, the price by end-1983 should have risen to about CFAF
107,000/m3 , implying an average of CFAF 98,000/m3 for the year.  Thereafter,
the price is projected to rise as explained in para 4.15 and shown in Annex 4-5,
again implying a total real price increase of 35% from 1983-1945.



- 18 -
3. Domestic Sawnwood
4.18      For domestic sawnwood, no long-term price information is available.
The grades to be sold domestically (about 13% of the total sawnwood production)
represent the poorer qualities and the species not readily marketable
internationally. The current price in Brazzaville is approximately CFAF
70,000/m3, or about 78% of the equivalent price for export sawnwood. This price
is significantly higher than that which prevailed in 1981 (about CFAF
40,000/m3) and reflects the current construction boom, particularly in
Brazzaville, combined with a lack of local sawmilling facilities. Since this
cannot be expected to last indefinitely, a more conservative 1983 price of CFAF
60,000/m3 has been assumed for the analysis contained in this report, and no
real price increase has been assumed thereafter.
4. Veneer
4.19      Veneer is a highly specialized commodity, sold on a limited scale in
limited markets. Sliced veneer of the type to be produced by the Project is
about twice as valuable as the more common peeled variety.  In September 1982,
peeled veneer prices in Pointe Noire were of the order of US$600-800/m3. In
view of the risks associated with sliced veneer production and for the purposes
of this analysis, it has nonetheless been assumed that the Project's veneer
output would sell at an average 1983 price of US$770/m3, or CFAF 261,8000/m3.
Production, however, does not in fact start until 1985. From 1983 onwards, in
line with the assumptions developed for logs and described in para 4.15, real
veneer prices are projected to rise as shown in Annex 4-5, recording an overall
real gain of 35% by 1995. This is an extremely conservative approach; however,
since the volume of veneer involved is small, the sensitivity of the Project's
financial performance to even rather substantial changes in this figure is
minimal (para 7.07).
F. Marketing
4.20      As yet, SCBO has no formal marketing agreement.  However, at the
Government's request and after having decided to invest in SCBO's equity, Silos
has agreed to undertake SCBO's export marketing for a margin not to exceed 4% of
the FOB price and on other terms and conditions to be established. SCBO has
prepared a Protocole d'Accord to this effect. The premises upon which this
Protocole is based and the implications thereof for the Project are outlined
further in the following paragraphs. For clarity, throughout this report we
will use the word  agreement" to refer to marketing arrangements established
between SCBO and Silos, and "contract" to refer to those established between
Silos and third parties.
1. Logs
4.21      By law (Article 3, Decree 75/191), since April 18, 1975, all
export-quality unprocessed logs produced in the Congo must be sold to OCB. To
date, OCB has acquired all such logs at prices established as described above
(para 4.14). In addition, and in order to encourage their investments, the two
northern log producers (CIB and Boissangha, paras 2.11 and 2.12) have



- 19 -
individual contracts with OCB under which they are obliged to repurchase 75% of
their production at the established FOB price less 4%, and have the right of
first refusal over the remaining 25% at the established FOB price.  As currently
envisaged, a similar arrangement would be made for SCBO, for an initial
three-year period, with the exception that Silos would have the obligation to
repurchase, at FOB less 4%, 75% of SCBO's annual export log production (normally
41,500 m3), with an option over the remaining 25% at FOB (undiscounted).
Payment would be by confirmed and irrevocable letter of credit; Silos would have
the right to substitute third parties of its choice, and product inspection
would be at the buyer's expense.
2. Sawnwood and Veneer
4.22      There is no established public sector marketing agency in Congo for
sawnwood and veneer. OCB has some limited experience in selling small amounts
of veneer for SONATRAB (para 2.09), and is expected to market all the Betou
sawnwood (para 2.14) when rehabilitation of this entity is completed. While
the on-going technical assistance program to OCB (para 2.15) will improve its
capacity to market wood products in addition to logs, the Government wisely
prefers to ensure the smooth and successful start-up of the SCBO Project by
acquiring, at least initially, marketing assistance from a foreign party. As a
result, as currently envisaged, SCBO would sell 100% of its sawnwood and veneer
exports to Silos at an established FOB price less 4%.  For sawnwood, which is
widely traded, an appropriate FOB price can be readily determined, but this is
not the case for veneer. Thus, the Protocole d'Accord stipulates that in the
event of divergencies of opinion on veneer prices an independent expert would be
retained to define objective indices whereby a price may be established. An
initial three-year agreement is envisaged (renewable annually thereafter), with
penalties for late payment and provisions for arbitration, and French law would
apply. Further, to promote the development of Congolese expertise in all areas
of forest industry, and in addition to the proposed agreement with Silos, the
Government has decided to establish a marketing organization within SCBO and, as
further detailed in para 5.31, has requested technical assistance within the
scope of the Ouesso Project, to this effect. The objective here is that with
successive renewals of the agreement, and in the light of the competitiveness of
Silos' proposals in a world market context, SCBO would undertake an increasing
proportion of its own marketing. This objective is desirable, and one that may
reasonably be obtained.
3. Marketing Risk
4.23      As outlined earlier, the prospects for the world tropical hardwood
market are in the seller's favor for at least the next 5-10 years, the proposed
terms of the agreement outlined above are normal for the industry, and were they
with an established tropical hardwood trader, would provide reasonable
assurances. Neither Silos nor any other of the 40 to 50 companies in the SEAV
INTERAGRA Group has any significant experience in trading tropical wood.
However, the bulk of the group's revenues (approximately US$1.5 billion in
1981), are obtained from trading in general and from trade with the Eastern
Block in particular, where cash revenues and payments are made in the West but
trade with the Block is primarily barter. Thus, in keeping with the group's
philosophy and market advantage, much of SCBO's output is likely, ultimately, to



- 20 -
be marketed as part of a complicated trading pattern between VWestern and Eastern
Europe.  With a value of about US$15 million annually at full production, the
total output from SCBO would represent less than 1% of the turnover of the SEAV
INTERAGRA group and the capacity of the group to market this volume cannot be
doubted. Further, to ensure market acceptability and to expand potential
outlets, SCBO intends to acquire engineering and management assistance (para
5.33) from a company with strong marketing experience and established access to
markets. Nonetheless, some risks remains and differs to some extent from
product to product as detailed below.
4.24      For logs, SCBO would not be exposed to any significant risk.  The
species concerned are well known, of 'high value, and even in today's depressed
market, could normally be sold at a remunerative price. The market is
relatively open and in the event that Silos experiences difficulties, it would
be OCB's, not SCBO's, responsibility to secure an alternative trader or
end-user. For the past two years, OCB has marketed about 300,000 m3 of
Congolese logs annually and the Project's anticipated output would only increase
this annual throughput by about 14%. For sawnwood, the market is also quite
open and quality requirements are reliatively easy to satisfy. Thus if Silos
experiences any difficulty marketing sawnwood, SCBO's marketing organization
(para 4.22) or OCB could reasonably be expected to secure alternative markets.
4.25      For veneer, however, the risk of not being able to market all of the
output is significantly greater. Quality is of major importance and relatively
more difficult to attain; there is a limited open market in veneer trade and
that between West Africa and Western Europe appears dominated by technical
partner relationships, where the European consumer or trader has an equity stake
in the African venture (and/or a technical contract) whereby it is responsible
for ensuring that mill design, construction, and ultimate production all satisfy
rigid quality specifications. The Government has been unsuccessful in its
attempts to attract such a partner for the Ouesso Project.  However, the
possibility that technical, and particularly advisory assistance for all plants
will be obtained from companies with eventual marketing potential is currently
under investigation. In any event, SCBO intends to acquire a comprehensive
package (which would be partially Bank-financed) of equipment, construction and
operating assistance from experienced suppliers, and these suppliers would be
required to guarantee veneer plant output of adequate quality to ensure
marketability. Thus, should Silos be unable to market the full output of
veneer, it is possible that SCBO's own marketing organization would be able to
find a purchaser for this particular product at a reasonable price. Even in the
unlikely event that it proves impossi'ble to market veneer at all, although both
the financial and economic rates of return would fall (paras 7.08 and 8.03),
they would still be at acceptable levels. On a cash-flow basis, were Silos to
experience veneer marketing problems initially, such that veneer sales in 1985
were only 25% of the level projected (rising thereafter as either Silos finds a
market or is replaced by SCBO's own marketing organization or a third party),
SCBO would still be able to service all of its debt. Thereafter, as the
company's financial situation improves, other things being equal, the impact of
reduced or non-existent veneer sales could be absorbed without major difficulty.
4.26      To conclude, although the proposed marketing arrangements do present a
risk to the Project, it is a risk that even on the downside would not prevent
the Project from earning a reasonable return. Nonetheless, to further ensure



- 21 -
successful marketing of anticipated Project output as well as an equitable
distribution of benefits, SCBO have agreed: (i) to submit all marketing
agreements to the Bank for approval prior to signing; (ii) to agree with the
Bank on the terms of reference and means of implementation of the proposed SCBO
marketing organization prior to June 1984; and (iii) to consult with the Bank
periodically, as the respective marketing agreements come up for renewal.
V. THE PROJECT
5.01      The Project consists of the establishment of an integrated logging and
wood-processing operation near Ouesso in northern Congo. As noted in Chapter I,
when steady-state operations are reached, production will be 100,000 m3 of
high-value hardwood logs annually, of which 41,500 m3 will be exported
directly. The balance of 58,500 m3 of logs will be converted to produce 23,000
m3 of sawnwood and 4,200 m3 of veneer. Facilities to be provided under the
Project include: logging and road-building equipment necessary to operate the
1.1 million ha concession and produce the required volume of logs; a sawmill; a
veneer-slicing plant; service facilities to produce electric power, water and
steam; housing and related social facilities for forestry and mill workers; and
some additional infrastructure, including a dock at the mill-site. The Project
also includes provision of technical assistance to the Sponsor for the
supervision, design and initial operation of the proposed plants, including
marketing. In addition, a technical assistance component to the Government for
related studies is proposed to ensure the successful regional integration of
tribal people into the Project, and to promote local capacity for the
development and supervision of the wood-processing sector. Details are provided
in the following paragraphs.
A. Project Selection and Concept
5.02      The Project is a direct outgrowth of the Government's efforts,
assisted by the Bank, to expand logging and wood processing in northern Congo.
This initiative, prompted both by a regional development goal and by the need to
seek alternative sources of logs to replace those from the heavily exploited
areas in the south, has already led to the establishment of two logging
operations in the region, Boissangha and CIB (paras 2.11 and 2.12). The forest
concession on which the proposed Ouesso Project will be based (UFA Est) is
bordered by the Sangha river to the east and the N'Goko river to the north.  It
was first inventoried by the Centre Technique Forestier Tropical (CTFT) as part
of a broader inventory of the region (covering three UFAs in total) which was
concluded in 1978. These inventory studies established that the UFA Est
concession contained a sufficient volume of commercial species (primarily red
woods) to support a logging operation of about 100,000 cubic meters annually,
for 20-25 years. Subsequently, in 1979, CTFT together with the Finnish
consulting company Jaakko Poyry Oy, (Poyry) carried out pre-feasibility studies
for each of the three UFAs, with the objective of defining and assessing
appropriate industrial development strategies.
5.03      The types of industrial development examined included sawmills, and
plants to produce sliced veneer, peeled veneer and plywood. Various plant
capacities and configurations were explored and the volume of logs exported



- 22 -
adjusted to match the extent of domestic processing and the annual log output
from the concession.  Domestic and export market potential for all of the
products was also analyzed. The pre-feasibility study concluded that although
domestic market possibilities for both sawnwood and panels were limited, there
would be little difficulty in exporting logs, sawnwood or veneer, of the species
found in the region, to established international markets. From the preliminary
cost and revenue estimates included in that study, the most profitable products
were found to be sawnwood and sliced veneer. Finally, the study concluded that
of the three UFAs examined, the UFA Est near Ouesso offered the best potential
for immediate development, and that a detailed feasibility study for a project
based on this resource should be undertaken.
5.04      Poyry and CTFT were assigned to undertake the full feasibility study,
which was financed in part by an IDA Project Preparation Facility.3/ By
evaluating markets in conjunction with an analysis of log quality in the
concession, this study determined the appropriate plant capacity.  The study was
reviewed by Canadian Consultants (Forestal International) who confirmed the
Poyry/CTFT findings. With Bank assistance, the Government began to look for
potential private foreign investors to help it to implement the Project, and in
November 1981, SCBO was established for this purpose (Chapter III).
5.05      The technology proposed for both logging and wood processing is
well-known in West Africa, and the species to be utilized by the Project are
processed extensively in other parts of Africa and in Europe. Boissangha is
already successfully operating a sawmill in the north while CIB is sawing
similar species in its mill in Brazzaville, and will start building its northern
sawmill shortly. The only veneer slicing plant currently operating in the
country is located in the south at Loubomo, and although special attention will
have to be given to training staff for log preparation and veneer handling, no
major difficulties are anticipated in establishing this relatively
straight-forward technology near Ouesso.
B. Forestry Operations
5.06      SCBO started forestry operations in the first half of 1982.  Logging
started in mid-February 1983. The principal species to be logged, representing
about 78% of the projected annual volume, is sapelli (Entandrophragma
cyclindricum). The other main species are sipo (Entandrophragma utile) and
douka (Tieghemella africana), each about 7%, kosipo (Entandrophragma candollei)
4%, and wenge (Millettia laurentii) 2%. On the basis of present cutting plans,
the proportion of sapelli will declines somewhat during the life of the Project,
while those of sipo and kosipo will increase. These commercial species will be
extracted in a selection-felling system, with a minimum log diameter of 80 cm.
Smaller trees will be left for possible subsequent extraction in a second pass
through the area which could take place after 20-25 years.  Trees to be
extracted will be identified by forestry crews who will also select road
alignments and prepare detailed management plans one year in advance of logging
operations. The total volume extracted during the first pass (about 8-10
m /ha), represents less than 10% of the total standing volume. The concession
area is relatively flat, with only a few short slopes (of 20% to 30%) alongside
3/ Approved in May 1978.



- 23 -
rivers. Establishing road alignments is thus relatively straight-forward,
although in view of the abundant year-round rainfall, special provision has to
be made to construct and maintain roads to high standards to allow the
transportation of logs throughout most of the year. The techniques for this are
well established in the region: roads are constructed at a somewhat higher
level than the surrounding land using fill from adjacent drainage ditches, and
then surfaced with laterite. Laterite has been located in several deposits in
the concession, but will normally have to be transported distances up to about
20 km to the road construction sites. The proposed road construction density is
about 8 to 10 km per 1,000 ha, so that approximately 100 km will have to be
constructed each year. In 1982, 138 km were constructed.
5.07       Logs will be felled and cut to length by chain saw and then skidded to
roadside landings using either tracked or wheeled skidders, from whence they
will be loaded on to trucks with a capacity of about 35 tons (or m3) for
transport to the mill site or, in the case of logs for export, to the nearest
river loading point. The transport distance will range from about 10 to 50 km,
with an average of 30 km during the first 15 years of exploitation.
C. Mill Operations
1. Log Handling
5.08      Logs delivered to Ouesso will be graded according to species, quality
and volume, and then unloaded by mobile crane.   Separate storage piles will be
maintained in the log yard for sawmill logs and those destined for the veneer
slicing plant. In total, such storage will be provided for about 15,000 m3 of
logs, or three months' supply at normal operating rates. The sawmill will saw
lower grade logs of all species, approximately in the same proportions as they
are found in the concession. The veneer plant will operate on top grade logs of
only three species: sapelli (about 82%), wenge (12%), and douka (6%). An
overhead crane will be used to recover logs from the log storage yard for
delivery to the two processing plants.
2. Sawmill
5.09      The sawmill will process 50,000 m3 of logs annually to produce 23,000
m3 of sawnwood at an average recovery factor (logs to sawnwood) of 46%. The
mill will operate on two shifts, five days per week, and to reach the planned
output, will have to process about four logs (of 5 m length and 1.2 m diameter)
per hour. This represents about 50% of the design capacity of the plant and is
readily attainable. Primary sawing will be accomplished with a single bandsaw,
through which the carriage-mounted log will be driven in several passes to
produce rough planks. These planks will be further cut down into usable sizes
(varying in thickness from about 16 mm up to 100 mm, and in widths from 100 mm
to 350 mm) in a circular resaw. A recovery line is included to handle slabs
from the edge of the logs and other large irregular-shaped pieces from which
useful sawnwood can be recovered. The rough-sawn wood will be trimmed to
length, sorted, and strapped in packages. Handling of these packages to outside
storage, and subsequently onto barges for shipment to Brazzaville and Pointe
Noire, will be carried out by fork-lift trucks. TWaste will be collected from
all operations by a series of conveyors, and delivered to a central storage area
prior to incineration in a boiler (para 5.12).



- 24 -
3. Veneer Plant
5.10       Logs selected for veneer production (8,500 m3 annually) will first be
sawn to length (up to 4 m) and then scquared in a special squaring saw. The
squared billets will be treated with steam (in the case of douka and sapelli) or
hot water (for wenge), for periods ranging from 50 to 100 hours, to soften them
prior to slicing. Approximately 9 miLlion sheets of veneer will be produced
annually, averaging 2.5 m in length, 0.3 m in width and 0.6 mm in thickness.
Veneer sheets will be dried to about 8% moisture content in a steam heated drier
and stacked manually onto pallets prior to trimming, sorting and packaging into
bales. Bales of veneer sheets will be stored under cover, and loaded into
containers for shipment to Pointe Noire.
4. Common Facilities
5.11       The sawmill and veneer plant each require special tool-sharpening
facilities which will be located in their respective buildings.  The sawmill
saw-sharpening facility will also handle the blades from the veneer plant
squaring saw. In addition to these s:pecialized workshops, a general maintenance
workshop will be provided, equipped to handle a full range of maintenance
tasks. In the design of this facility, and in the selection of maintenance
equipment, consideration has been given to the isolated location of Ouesso, and
the need for self-sufficiency in repair and overhaul work.
5.12       The plant will also be self-sufficient in energy production.  A boiler
fired with waste wood from the processing plants will generate up to 27
tons/hour of steam for softening veneer billets and drying veneer, and also for
generating electric power in two turbo-generator sets. Total capacity of these
generators will be 2.4 MW. In addition, for start-ups and emergencies, a diesel
generator with a capacity of 380 KW will be installed. The power-generation
system has been sized to meet the needs of the mill community as well as of the
plant.
5.13       Other facilities common to *both the sawmill and veneer plant include a
pumping station for process and potable water, and a quay on the river bank for
loading barges with heavy logs, sawnwood, and veneer for shipment to
Brazzaville.
D. Housing and Social Infrastructure
5.14       At full operation, the Project will provide direct employment for 536
people. SCBO plans to provide accommodation in two locations for all of these
employees and their families. This proposal would lead to the establishment of
a forest township, which will eventually house 180 employees, and a mill
township for 356 employees. The forest housing would be prefabricated units,
imported from Europe, with central toilet blocks, a kitchen, social facilities
and a clinic. This has already been purchased and is en route to Ouesso.
5.15       Although the original planning and cost estimates for all employee
housing were based on this concept, SCBO has developed plans for the mill
township which are more appropriate to the needs of the locally-recruited
employees. Construction of management housing and central social facilities
will be included in the mill site. Worker-housing will be situated nearby, in



- 25 -
light of prevailing topographical and wind conditions. The housing is being
designed by a local group of architects to maximize use of traditional resources
and styles, in line with modern artistic, sanitary and hygenic norms.
E. Transport
5.16      In view of the location of the Project, transportation is of critical
importance. Freight will represent some 20% of the plant's capital cost, and
almost 50% of the cost of the products at the point of sale in Pointe Noire. In
addition to the high significance of freight costs in the economics of the
Project, problems with transport, and particularly the railway, have been
serious in recent years, and planned improvements to both river and rail
transport will have to be realized if the benefits anticipated from the Project
are to be obtained.
5.17      The bulk of Congo's transport sector is operated by the Agence
Transcongolaise des Communications (ATC), comprising: the Chemin de fer Congo
Ocean (CFCO) railway, which links Brazzaville to Pointe Noire; ATC's river
transport operations, which provide the main upstream complement to the CFCO
railway; and the ports of Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. This transport system
serves not only the Congo, but also the Central African Republic (CAR), eastern
Cameroon, Gabon and, to a limited extent, southern Chad. In recent years, more
than three quarters of the rail freight carried between Brazzaville and Pointe
Noire has been transit traffic: mainly manganese from Gabon, timber from
Cameroon and the CAR, and upstream imports to the CAR. As a result, the CFCO is
currently operating close to capacity, which is limited by shortages of rolling
stock, exacerbated by an inadequate maintenance organization (now being
improved), and by a 90 km mountainous section of line. Sixty new wagons are
under delivery, and about one hundred and fifty additional commercial wagons
will be purchased shortly. Construction of a realigned section to improve rail
operations through the mountains is also underway with World Bank Group and
co-donor financing (para 2.10), and completion is expected by end-1984. These
developments, together with associated technical assistance being provided to
CFCO, should ease the capacity constraint in time to meet the production needs
of the SCBO Project.
5.18      Present river transport operations suffer from a lack of systematic
organization, problems with silting at the entrance to the log port in
Brazzaville, and a shortage of floating craft and service facilities. In 1981,
total freight handled through the port of Brazzaville amounted to 562,000 tons,
of which 399,000 tons was timber, mostly logs. The SCBO project alone would
increase timber through the port of Brazzaville by about 60,000 tons annually.
The other two proposed timber operations in the Sangha (para 2.14) would also
each add approximately 60,000 tons annually to this throughput. Without
significant improvements to existing operations, it is apparent that neither
ATC's timber fleet nor the port of Brazzaville would be able to handle this
additional volume without serious disruption and delay. However, by providing
management assistance and training, and certain critical equipment such as
tugboats and barges, the recently approved IDA-supported River Transport Project
(para 2.15), which was planned specifically to meet the demands of additional
timber traffic from the north, is addressing the most serious of these problems.
5.19      The existing ATC fleet of 38 small tugboats (micro-pushers) handled
approximately 146,000 tons of floating timber in 1981. With projected increases
in efficiency through improved maintenance and scheduling envisaged under the



- 26 -
aforementioned project, annual capacity should increase to 220,000 tons which
would be sufficient to handle the additional 90,000 tons of floating logs
expected when the three planned UFA operations are at full capacity.  Although
expansions to the fleet may be necessary after 1985, and particularly if further
expansion in the North takes place, river transport of floating logs is not
expected to be a major transportation bottleneck.
5.20      For barged timber (non-floatable logs, sawnwood, and veneer), the
situation is less satisfactory. The 17 timber barges which are functioning
today can handle only 30 - 35.000 tons of timnber annually (compared with a
present demand of about 40,000 tons), and ATC has been forced to utilize
general-cargo barges for timber transport, nost of which are old and
inadequately designed for this service. Private transport operators currently
have the capacity to handle about 10,000 tons of barged timber annually but this
figure is not expected to increase significantly. With the expansions now
envisaged in the north, the requirement for timber barge capacity will increase
to about 100,000 tons annually, necessitating new barges as well as productivity
improvements to the existing fleet.
5.21      The Federal Republic of Germany, through the KfW, is financing the
purchase of two mixed (oil/timber) barges to be delivered by mid-1984. The
recent IDA project is also financing two mixed barges, four 300-ton timber
barges and one line pusher which have been delivered.  Five barges and a line
pusher have been ordered for 1983, and a further 5 barges are being ordered for
delivery late-1983/early-1984. However, even with all of these additions, more
barges may be required in the mid/late 1980s, to meet projected traffic. With
the rapid fleet expansion envisaged over the next 1-2 years, and the relatively
short delivery time for barges (about 12 months from the date of ordering), it
would be inappropriate to seek additional investments in fleet capacity to meet
possible shortfalls in capacity projected four years hence.  Nevertheless,
the Government has agreed to continuously monitor the railway system and river
fleet capacity and demand, and that the necessary further investments will be
made as required to meet projected needs. Ongoing supervision of the railway
and river transport projects as well as the SCBO Project will give the Bank
every opportunity to assist the Government to monitor capacity requirements.
5.22       The above, notwithstanding, SCBO have experienced and is still
experiencing great difficulty in transporting equipment upstream. Project
implementation has already been delayed by this, and cost increased. Further
delays and further cost increases are allowed for in the financial projections
contained in this report. The projections also incorporate substantial
allowances for all product inventoriEs at mill site, at Brazzaville and at
Pointe Noire, totalling an average of 17 weeks for logs and 24 weeks for
sawnwood and veneer. SCBO is also actively investigating alternative routes and
means of transport.
F. Environmental Considerations
5.23       The Project imposes no particular stresses on the physical
environment. The proposed logging operations are similar to those undertaken in
other parts of West Africa.  The selection-felling system proposed (para 5.06)
removes only a small proportion of the tree-cover, and current legislation



- 27 -
requires loggers to ensure that minimum damage is inflicted on existing
regeneration and that there is adequate protection of the watershed from
erosion.  Sawmilling and veneer operations are relatively pollution-free.  Solid
wastes from both operations will be collected and incinerated in a boiler with
cyclonic separators to control fly-ash emissions. Effluent discharges will be
limited to drainage from log soaking and steaming operations. While it will be
high in BOD, this very small volume can safely be discharged into the flow of
the Sangha River where it will be rapidly dispersed.
C. The Impact on Tribal People
5.24      A much more significant environmental consideration relates to the
effect of forestry operations on the indigenous minority pygmy population, and
the employment of pygmies in the Project work force. The pygmy people of
Congo's north are already affected by forestry development in the Sangha
region. Further development of the region is inevitable and one of the most
important roles for the Bank in supporting the proposed Project would be to
ensure that the proper steps are taken to consider the problems of the pygmy
population while implementing the Ouesso Project in particular, and developing
the northern economy in general. In line with the Bank operations directive
concerning tribal people, the Bank's appraisal mission included an experienced
anthropologist specifically to examine this issue. His report is contained in
the Project file (Ref. B4). The following paragraphs summarize the principal
points raised.
5.25      Government statistics, which because of enumeration problems probably
understate the pygmy population, indicate that there are approximately 4,000
pygmies among the 45,000 people living in the Sangha region, an area of 55,800
kmw. The pygmies have all the characteristics of tribal people in that they are
geographically isolated; unacculturated to the surrounding Bantu-speaking,
farming majority; largely non-monetized; ethnically distinct; non-literate; and
do not participate in the political processes of the district, region or the
country.  Since the area is sparsely populated (about 0.5 people per kM2,
excluding Ouesso), pygmy bands have experienced little opposition to their
traditional exercise of loose collective tenure over the forest resources, but
these rights have been given no formal recognition in national forest or land
law. Pygmies have no designated forest reserves, and there are no legal
provisions or procedures for compensating them should forestry development
encroach on their resource base. On the other hand since pygmies rarely move
out of a "home" area of about 80 km2, it is not clear that the creation of
reserves is appropriate.
5.26      Further, the two existing northern concession townships already have a
total pygmy population approaching 1,400, or 35% of the total pygmy population.
Yet their concession areas cover only about 7,600 km2 and only 10% of this area
has so far been touched. It is therefore clear that there has been a shift in
income strategies toward intermittent forest-wage rather than village-goods
labor that is significantly more than in proportion to the extent to which such
forestry development has reduced the opportunity for these pygmies to continue
their traditional hunting and gathering activities. The case that compensation
is required is then also unclear. However, it is true that although the
productivity of pygmy workers in forestry work is reportedly double that of
other ethnic groups, presumably because of an intimate life-long association



- 28 -
with the forest, they are unable to progress beyond the lowest paid jobs
because: (a) they are neither literate nor numerate; (b) they must supplement
their wage income with more traditional activities (hunting, fishing, land
clearing for others), and are thus often absent from their wage-paying
employment; (c) they lack access to official sanctions necessary for formal and
legal acceptance into the regular work-force; and (d) above all, they are
regarded as inferiors by other ethnic groups who will not accept them as
supervisors. Thus, although pygmies have resettled in large numbers around the
forestry operations of Boissangha and CIB, there are none in company housing and
no pygmy children in the schools. As a result, pygmies in these settlements
suffer predictably from malnutrition, poor sanitation, and a loss among the
younger generation of the forest skills of their parents.
5.27      This brief analysis of the problems of pygmy integration (which is
considerably elaborated in the referenced paper), points to some of the
solutions which may be appropriate for, and which to some extent have already
been tested by, SCBO. SCBO's present activities are limited to forest inventory
work (and road construction) but because of their demonstrable skills in this
work, the company has favored the employment of pygmies. These workers are paid
basic forest-workers' wages which are higher than can be obtained from the
alternative wage-paying activities (plantation work and land-clearing) in the
Ouesso region. In addition, the workers receive bonuses for overtime and two
meals of meat or canned fish and manioc each work day. Under these conditions,
absenteeism is comparatively low, although resentment from other workers
persists, and there is little possibility under present circumstances that pygmy
workers could be promoted into skilled positions.
5.28      Bank involvement with the Project provides an excellent opportunity to
support and expand SCBO's initiatives in improving the lot of pygmy workers in
the Ouesso region. Positive factors which support such an initiative in this
particular case are: (a) SCBO's demonstrated interest in the welfare of its
workers in general, and pygmy workers in particular; (b) the special skills of
these workers in forest activities; and (c) the Government's official commitment
to supporting the attraction and retention of labor in the north (although there
is little specific commitment, as yet, to addressing the pygmies).
5.29      To address this issue the technical assistance to the Government would
include a specific multi-faceted component. This component would both study the
conditions of pygmies in the area and support and monitor the efforts of SCBO to
recruit, train and upgrade all workers, but pygmy workers in particular. In
view of the sensitivities involved, expert training and anthropological support
would be provided. The proposed terms of reference, including preparation of an
action plan, are shown in Annex 5-1. The scope and cost of implementing the
action plan cannot be determined until the study is completed. However, an
allowance of US$1.1 million to cover the foreign exchange cost of both the study
and implementation of the action plan has been included in the proposed project
cost.
5.30      The study including preparation of the action plan, is expected to
take about 18 months to complete.  It would be financed and carried out by the



- 29 -
Government using an organization of international standing, hired according to
terms of reference and on other terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
Local social scientists to the greatest possible extent would be used.  For the
study, about 40 man-months of expatriate consultant time are anticipated at a
base average cost per man-month of US$2,000, plus a further US$500/month for
travel and subsistence. The Government have agreed to submit a financing plan
by March 31, 1984 and to hire such consultants on such terms and conditions by
no later than June 30, 1984. Further, they have provided assurances that the
agreed action plan will be implemented by December 31, 1985, and financing
secured as required.
H. Project Implementation, Staffing and Training
5.31      As noted in Chapter III, the foreign project partners, while
experienced in international business in general and operations in the Congo in
particular, have no experience in wood processing. To overcome this deficiency,
certain specific measures are being implemented.
(i)   Principal SCBO operational staff are being recruited through
international advertisement, and only individuals with West African
forestry and wood-processing experience are being employed. Sound
core management satisfying these requirements is already in place;
(ii)   The plant itself will be procured as a single turnkey package,
including basic and detailed engineering with appropriate performance
guarantees, supply, installation, training, start-up and assistance
for initial operation (civil works will be internationally bid and
undertaken as a nominated subcontract to the turnkey); and
(iii)   Consultant engineers are being hired through the use of a second PPF
to assist SCBO in procurement of this package as well as in its
subsequent implementation, through start-up and initial (2 years)
operation.
Primary responsibility for Project implementation will rest with the turnkey
contractor and his performance will be monitored by the consultant engineers.
5.32      The Technical Director, who has already been recruited, has over 25
years' experience in forestry and timber processing operations in Cameroon and
the Ivory Coast and is well-qualified for this assignment with SCBO. The Forest
Manager has also been appointed, and has 10 years' experience in forest
operations in Congo and Cameroon. Three additional expatriates had been
recruited by February 1983, and SCBO has agreed to submit the Curricula Vitae of
these individuals for the Bank to review.
5.33      As noted earlier, arrangements have already begun for the appointment
of an experienced firm as consultant engineers to assist SCBO in procurement of
the turnkey package as well as subsequent supervision of construction,
installation and start-up. Terms of Reference and a short-list of qualified
firms have been prepared; the selection of this firm will be according to Bank
guidelines, and its appointment would be financed under the second PPF, as
mentioned above (para 5.31).



- 30 -
5.34      As also noted, the turnkey package put out for tender includes the
provision of initial start-up and management assistance from an experienced
operating entity (which would form part of the turnkey consortium).  Since
financing of the foreign exchange cost of this component would be included in
the proposed Bank loan, both the scope! of work and the consultants concerned
would be acceptable to the Bank.
5.35      Training incorporated in the Project will aim at upgrading the skills
of locally hired workers, in order to create a stable and permanent work force.
Of the 536 persons to be employed, about 100 will have to have specialized
skills, and will be recruited from among the employees of the approximately 150
logging and timber processing operations already operating in Congo, or from
among forestry school graduates, or from operations in neighboring countries
(Cameroon and CAR).  A further 200 staff will require some skill (such as
drivers, mechanics and typists) and will be recruited from schools in the Ouesso
region and from other operations. The balance of 186 staff will be unskilled
workers, all of whom could be recruited locally. Training for all employees
will be conducted on the job by their line-foremen and managers. This type of
training is usual and appropriate for operations of this type, and conforms to
the Government's wishes for training in the sector as set out in the Forestry
Development Plan, 1973-84.
5.36      Forestry mill operations are already underway and have been since
mid-1982. Road-building and logging equipment is now on site and the imported
forest township is en route to Ouesso; 138 km of roads were built in 1982 and
11,000 m3 were logged between mid-February and mid-March 1983. Selection of the
consultant engineer is expected to take place in May 1983, and negotiations with
the selected turnkey contractor will begin in July. The implementation schedule
for the Project is shown below. Key dates are: (a) the effectiveness of the
financing plan between June and Septemaber 1983; (b) the placement of equipment
orders in September 1983; and (c) the appointment of the Civil Works Contractor
in December 1983. The turnkey contract would be based on a twelve-month period
of Project implementation which is normal for projects of this type. However,
to account for possible delays in imp:lementation, and particularly those
associated with transportation to the remote Project location, an additional six
months has been allowed. Under this schedule, which is realistic, the sawmill
will start up in March 1985, and the veneer plant three months later.

I. Government Technical Assistance Component
5.37       The proposed technical assistance component to the Government
comprises two parts. The first concerns the impact on, and employment of tribal
people in the Project as discussed above (paras 5.25-5.30).  The second is the
supply of consultant services to the Government for a new Project Administration
Unit to be established in the Ministry of Water and Forests.
5.38       The need for this latter assistance is evidenced by the growing number
of joint-venture and public sector forestry related projects being established
in Congo, and the increasing burden which this activity places on the
Government's resources. The objective would be to strengthen and rationalize
the Ministry's activities in a two-prong program. The first would include
approximately three years of assistance from a forest economist, lawyer and
financial analyst, respectively, aimed at upgrading: (i) sector analysis and
planning; (ii) the intent and actual impact of all forest legislation; and (iii)
analysis and monitoring of the finances of existing and proposed enterprises
under the Ministry's responsibility.  The second component would cover training
abroad for about four staff in marketing. An allowance has also been made for
the financing of studies of various subsectors that may be required based on the



- 32 -
findings of the experts referred to above. Draft terms of references are being
prepared by the Ministry of Water and Forests and will be submitted to the Bank
by July 1983.  The Government has further agreed that the consultants required
to implement this component will be hiLred on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank, by no later than June 30, 19'84.
VI. CAPITAL COSTS, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A. Capital Costs
6.01      Total financing required for the SCBO Project, including operating
assistance, that portion of the working capital not financed by local short-term
debt, interest during construction and the Bank's front-end fee, is estimated at
US$40 million equivalent, of which US'i30 million (77%) is direct and indirect
foreign exchange. In addition, US$2.9 million will be required for technical
assistance to the Government including US$2.5 million in foreign exchange.
Provision has been made for all necessary support services and infrastructure.
The cost estimate is presented in detail in Annex 6-1 and summarized in the
table on the following page.
6.02      The base Project cost estimate was prepared in April 1983 prices by
SCBO using offer prices by potential turnkey suppliers and actual prices for
some of the goods which have already been procured.  For imported goods, the
estimate includes ocean freight to Pointe Noire, customs duty amounting to 5% of
the CIF cost, and transport to Ouesso.. The cost of the civil works (included in
the main package--paras 6.07 and 6.8) was estimated by Poyry in 1980, and has
been updated to estimated current prices at commitment. The estimate includes
provision for technical assistance to SCBO including supervisory engineering,
project management and start-up assistance. A total of 178 man-months of
technical assistance has been providedl for, at an average cost of US$10,000
equivalent per man-month, excluding travel and subsistence expenses estimated at
US$3,000 equivalent per man-month. These quantities and rates are realistic.
Physical contingencies have been estimated at 15% of the Base Cost Estimate
(BCE) for civil works, and 10% for other items. However, because some items
have already been procured, physical contingencies represent only 8% of the
BCE. Provision for price escalation has been incorporated assuming an
international inflation rate of 8% for 1983, and 7.5% for 1984; and a domestic
rate of 14% in 1983, 12% in 1984 and 10% in 1985. However, as the BCE was
prepared in April 1983 prices, and the contract for all equipment purchases is
expected to be concluded by the last quarter of 1983, the total provision for
price escalation represents a relatively low 13% of the BCE. Total working
capital through 1986, of US$4.6 million in current prices, is based on the
inventories of raw materials and finished products shown in Annex 6-2.
Capitalized interest, commitment fees and the Bank's front-end fee, amounting in
total to US$5.5 million, have been estimated assuming the disbursement schedules
and financing plan described in the following paragraphs.

6.04      SCBO's initial equity investment of US$7.35 million represents 19% of
the total financing required. Additional equity financing of US$6.3 million
would be generated from the sale of logs in 1983 and 1984, bringing the equity
investment to 35% of total financing required. The financial projections
contained in Chapter VII of this report show that the Project will generate
sufficient earnings to finance this investment, while maintaining a satisfactory
financial position. SCBO has obtained a Shareholders' Agreement from its
investors (para 3.07) confirming that they will provide all of the necessary
resources and other assistance to SCBO required for it to fulfill its
undertakings with respect to the Project, and in particular, confirming their
equity contribution, confirming that retained earnings will be reinvested until
Project completion, and confirming that, in the event that earnings do not
materialize as envisaged, they will agree to provide additional financing to
complete the Project. Finally, SCBO has agreed to secure financing for any cost
overruns that may be incurred up to the time of Project completion, on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank, and in particular including sufficient equity
to maintain a ratio of debt to equity no greater than the 67:33 ratio envisaged
in the original financing plan and a current ratio at Project completion of
1.3. Under the Shareholders' Agreement the Project partners would also be
required to support this. (As discussed with SCBO, any additional financing
required could be provided in the fonn of subordinated loans if the terms and
conditions were acceptable to the Bank. If this approach were to be used, the
subordinated debt would not be included in calculation of the financial ratios
mentioned in para 7.13.) For the purpose of these undertakings, the Project
will be considered complete when the equipment and facilities have been tested



- 35 -
and proven satisfactory in accordance with established engineering procedures,
and have operated at, on average, at least 80% of normal output for at least six
months. This is expected to happen by mid-1986. At this level of capacity
utilization, Project operations show slightly better than break-even financial
performance.
6.05      The proposed Bank loan of US$12.0 million would be made to the
Government, which would retain US$1.5 million to finance the estimated foreign
exchange cost of the technical support to the Government described in para
5.38. The balance of the proceeds of the loan (US$10.5 million) would be onlent
to SCBO under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement. The signing of a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement acceptable to the Bank would be a condition of Bank loan
effectiveness. The Government would receive these funds at the standard annual
variable interest rate for Bank loans (currently 10.97%) for a period of 15
years including four years' grace. The portion of the loan passed on to SCBO
would be on the same repayment terms, but at 1.1 times the variable interest
rate to the Government. SCBO would bear the foreign exchange risk. The Bank's
front-end fee of 0.25% of the loan amount would be financed from the proceeds of
the loan. For the financial projections contained in this report, it has been
assumed that the proceeds of the Bank loan would be passed on to the Project at
a fixed annual average interest rate of 12.06%, and with a commitment fee of
0.75%.  The terms and conditions under which the proceeds of the Bank loan would
be passed on to the Project would be embodied in a Subsidiary Loan Agreement
acceptable to the Bank.
6.06      Other sources of debt financing for the Project include suppliers'
credits, and local banks. SCBO are requiring potential suppliers of the
turnkey package to secure financing as part of their offer. For the financial
projections shown here, the terms offered by the Compagnie Francaise d'Assurance
au Commerce Exterieur (COFACE) have been used as indicative. These would
correspond to a loan amount of US$7.8 million equivalent, with a front-end fee
of 0.5% , a commitment fee also of 0.5% and annual interest at 10.0% for nine
years, including 18 months of grace from initial disbursement. The
effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan would be conditional upon the
cross-effectiveness of this loan. Another suppliers' credit (US$4.4 million
equivalent) from the Saudi European Bank has already been arranged and is being
used to finance a portion of the forestry equipment and housing which has
already been procured. This credit bears a variable interest rate currently of
11.6% and is to be repaid over two years after one year of grace from delivery.
An additional credit of US$3.0 million from the Banque Nationale de
Developpement Congolaise is being arranged to complete the purchase of these
items. It would be repaid over five years after two years' grace; the interest
rate would be 13% and the commitment fee would be 0.9%. Effectiveness of this
credit would also be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan.
Current terms on such loans are a 0.5% commitment fee, an annual interest rate
of 12% and repayment over seven years, including two years' grace.
C. Procurement and Disbursement
6.07      A preliminary allocation of items to be financed by the co-financiers
has been made.  Under this proposal Bank funds would be used to finance:  (a)
part of the turnkey package for the sawmill and veneer plant, specifically

engineers to SCBO; (d) technical assistance to the Government; (e) refinancing
PPF funds already extended; and (f) some interest during construction on the
Bank's loan and the front-end fee. The basis for the allocation, and the
specific items proposed for Bank financing are discussed in the following
paragraphs.
6.08      The total cost of the turnkey package for the sawmill and veneer plant
is estimated to be US$16.6 million equivalent of which US$12.7 million is
foreign exchange. This package is being procured using limited international
tender from qualified suppliers, and offers from three groups have been
received. Final selection will be subject to Bank approval. Bank funds would,
however, be used only to finance technical assistance under this contract. They
would also be used to finance civil works bid internationally according to Bank
procedures and executed as a nominated subcontract to the turnkey itself.
6.09      The proceeds of the proposed loan would, in addition, finance the
foreign exchange costs of all other technical assistance to SCBO including
refinancing of project preparation funds already expended for the feasibility
studies (para 5.04), and future expenditures proposed for the consultant
engineers, (paras 5.31-5.34). Bank funds would also be used to finance the
Government technical assistance (para 5.38). Procurement for all of these
services will be according to the Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants.
Further, since the appointment of the consultant engineers as well as of those
providing the engineering and project management components for the turn-key
package is expected in May and July 1983, respectively, a second PPF advance to
finance these items has been approved. This PPF advance would also be
refinanced by the proposed loan (para 6.11).
6.10      The procurement of forestry equipment and some prefabricated housing
has already been initiated. Forestry equipment was procured through a limited
international tender. Forestry housing requirements have been purchased
directly as prefabricated units from a French supplier. No Bank funds will be
utilized for these packages, or for extensions to procurement from these
suppliers. Mill housing, however, constructed on traditional and locally
approved lines, will be included in the civil works contract.
6.11      The proposed allocation of the Bank Loan is shown below.  The
projected schedule of disbursement is given in Annex 6-3. All Bank funds are
expected to have been disbursed by December 1986. This is relatively rapid but
as most of the Bank's funds would be used to finance urgently needed consultant
services and civil works, and in view of the relatively good disbursement
experience in Congo, this is realistic:

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Assumptions
7.01      The assumptions used for the financial analysis of the Project are
detailed in Annex 7-1. The analysis assumes that log production in 1983 will
total 50,000 m , increasing to planned full production of 100,000 m3 in 1986 and
thereafter. The sawmill will begin operation in November 1984, and produce 43%
of planned output in 1985, rising to 100% in 1986 and thereafter.   The veneer
plant will start up five months later, producing 40% of planned output in 1985
and 100% thereafter. Planned output from each of these plants is about 50% of
theoretical capacity. Based on the start-up and operational experience of CIB
and Boissangha, this production build-up and level of capacity utilization are
realistic. According to the detailed forest inventory figures which have been
prepared, the UFA Est concession should be able to provide adequate quantities
of logs to support the operation for 100 years. However, on the basis of
expected plant life without major reconstruction, the financial analysis assumes
a Project life after start-up of 15 years, and a residual plant value at the end
of that period (in 1998) of 10% of the original cost.
7.02      The financial projections are in current prices through 1985, the
first year of sawnwood and veneer production, and constant 1985 prices
thereafter. Base prices in the estimate are at April 1982 and April
1983 levels. Projected rates of inflation for international prices are 8% for
1982 and 1983, 7.5% for 1984, and 7.0% for 1985. For domestic prices, the
assumed rates are 14% in 1982 and 1983, 12% in 1984 and 10% in 1985.



- 38 -
B. Sales Volume and Revenues
7.03       Sales volumes will lag production in the early years of operation as
inventories of logs and manufactured products are built up at Ouesso,
Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. Details of production, sales and inventory
volumes are presented in Annex 7-2. Average prices for exported products, at
April 1983 price levels, per cubic meter FAS Pointe Noire, are CFAF 37,700 for
logs, CFAF 98,200 for sawnwood, and CFAF 261,800 for veneer. Thereafter, prices
are projected to rise in real terms as shown in Annex 4-5. For domestic sales
of sawnwood, a delivered price at Brazzaville of CFAF 60,000/m3 has been used.
Revenue projections are shown in the income statement (para 7.05).
C. Production Costs
7.04      Production costs have been projected on the basis of the feasibility
study estimates, updated by SCBO, reviewed during appraisal, and revised as
appropriate in the light of subsequent events. The principal cost items
are transport (representing 49% of annual costs at full production) and labor
(19%). Details are presented in Annex 7-3. Average unit cost data are
summarized in the following table:

a/ Current prices through 1985; constant 1985 prices thereafter.
7.06       The above forecasts show that debt-service coverage and the ratio of
long-term debt to equity are satisfactory after anticipated project completion
in 1986.  Prior to that date, both net current assets and interest will be
financed with long-term funds. Substantial cash will be generated from 1983,
the first year of log exports. However, because 16% of the total project cost
is to be financed from retained earnings, there is no significant cash
accumulation until 1986, the year after the sawmill and veneer plant come into
production.



- 40 -
And, as noted in para 6.04, the shareholders of SCBO have agreed to undertake to
secure additional financing and, if necessary, to increase their direct equity
investment if cash generation from operations falls below projected levels or
cost overruns occur, to ensure that the Project is nonetheless completed and,
further, that debt:equity ratio upon completion and thereafter does not exceed
67:33 or the current ratio fall below 1.3.
7.07      The Project will pay a tax on exported logs of CFAF 500/m3 from the
first year of operation.  In addition, after a tax holiday of five years from
the start-up of the sawmill and veneer plant, forestry taxes totalling CFAF
720/m3 on all logs produced, and a variety of other taxes will be paid including
license tax, company tax, personnel taxes, turnover tax and vehicle tax. From
1987, annual dividends have been projected to equal 20% of the share capital,
without the current ratio declining below 1.5 in any year.
E. Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
7.08      The base-case financial return for the Project, calculated in constant
1982 prices and ignoring interest on potential cash balances, is about 21%
before taxes and 18% after taxes (Annex 7-7). The discounted cash flow return
on equity is 22%. These returns are most sensitive to selling price and, to a
lesser extent, to freight charges and rates of production build-up and capacity
utilization. Results of a sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following
table:

Other Changes
- capital cost up by 10%                                       19.3            16.6
- log tax increased by 100%                                    21.6            18.0
- no tax holiday                                               21.8            17.0
7.09      As the prices of logs, sawnwood and veneer are highly susceptible to
both world-wide construction activity and the supply of logs from other sources,
the sensitivity of Project returns to prices is particularly important. The
analysis shows that while a 10% price change would have a marked effect on
Project returns, they would nonetheless remain satisfactory. Further, as noted
in Chapter IV, current prices are exceptionally low, and that the real price
increases projected through 1986 should fail to materialize is most unlikely.
Thereafter, even should no further price increases occur, the Project's return
would be more than adequate.
7.10      River transport tariffs have recently been increased by about 12%, and
these new rates, plus an average of 15% taxes which are currently applied, have
been used in the analysis. However, according to the Bank's Western Africa
Regional Projects Department, current freight rates are still below their
economic costs and further increases will be effected in line with procedures
agreed in the financial covenants for the Bank financed railway and river
transport projects. The sensitivity analysis shows that Project returns with a
further 15% increase in tariffs, which would represent full cost recovery, could
still be satisfactory although financial performance in the early years would be
adversely affected.



- 42 -
7.11      Although the base-case assumptions concerning start-up, production
build-up and capacity utilization are reasonable, it is conceivable that delays
in implementation and start-up may cause an unanticipated short-fall in
performance. The sensitivity analysis shows that the Project can withstand
reasonable delays in these areas.
7.12      The final sensitivity tests tabulated above show the effect of no
veneer production (as discussed in para 4.25), capital cost increases, and
possible changes in Government policy concerning taxation. The results show
that with no veneer production, the projected return would remain satisfactory
and also that the projected returns would not be unduly affected by reasonable
changes in the taxation regime.
F. Financial Covenants
7.13      SCBO have agreed that during the term of the proposed Bank loan to the
Project, except as the Bank may otherwise agree, it will: (i) maintain a
debt:equity ratio not greater than 67:33; (ii) maintain a current ratio from
Project completion onwards of at least 1.3:1; (iii) not declare any dividend
nor pay any interest or principal on subordinated debt before Project completion
as defined in para 6.04 and thereafter only if the current ratio is maintained
at 1.3; and (iv) not incur any additional debt unless a reasonable projection of
revenues for each year during the term of the debt to be incurred shows that
debt service coverage will not fall below 1.5.
G. Auditing and Reporting Requirements
7.14      SCBO have agreed to furnish, if and when requested, any plans,
specifications, reports, contract documents, construction and procurement
schedules or any other Project documentation as the Bank may reasonably
require. SCBO have also agreed to: (i) maintain records and procedures
adequate to record and monitor the progress of the Project including its costs
and the benefits to be derived from it, to identify the goods and services
financed out of the proceeds of the loan, and to disclose their use in the
Project; (ii) to enable the Bank's accredited representatives to visit the
facilities and construction sites included in the Project and to examine the
goods financed out of the proceeds of the loan and any relevant records and
documents; (iii) to furnish to the Bank at regular intervals all such
information as the Bank shall reasonably request concerning the Project, its
cost and, where appropriate, the benefits to be derived from it; and (iv) to
have its accounts audited, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and
to submit certified copies of its financial statements (together with the
auditor's report) as soon as available, but in any case not later than six
months after the end of each financial year. Finally, upon completion of the
Project, the Company have agreed to prepare and furnish to the Bank a
comprehensive report on the Project, its implementation, initial operation and
the costs and benefits derived and expected to the derived therefrom.

VIII.  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND RISKS
A. Adjusted Costs and Benefits for Economic Analysis
8.01      To obtain economic costs and benefits, financial data have been
adjusted to economic values. The assumptions and adjustments which have been
made are detailed in Annex 8-1. For capital costs, the only adjustment has been
the removal of customs duties. Production costs have been adjusted by
eliminating taxes, by using economic rather than financial freight costs, and by
shadow-pricing unskilled labor (representing some 40% of total labor), at two
thirds of its financial cost. To determine an economic value for standing
timber, the normal procedure is to take economic prices for logs or connected
timber products, deduct economic transport, conversion and logging costs, artd
make a further deduction for a reasonable profit margin to the investor who
provides the necessary production facilities. The residual benefit (if any) is
the economic value of the standing timber. This procedure has been used in this
analysis. An after-tax profit of 15% on equity has been allowed, which yields a
surplus of CFAF 1,800 (equivalent to US$5.30 per m3 of standing timber).
Product selling prices have not been adjusted: apart from the small amount of
sawnwood sold domestically, the products are sold at international prices.
Economic cost and benefit streams, brought to a constant 1982 basis, are shown
in Annex 8-2.
B. Economic Rate of Return
8.02      The economic rate of return for the Project is 19.6%, compared with
the before-tax financial rate of return of 20.9% (para 7.08). The difference in
the two rates of return is due to downward adjustments in capital costs by the
removal of duties, which increases the return by 0.3%, a net upward adjustment
in production costs after removing taxes, shadow-pricing unskilled labor, and
adding an economic value for standing timber, which decreases it by 1.0%; and an
upward adjustment in freight costs which further decreases the rate of return by
0.5%. The net present value of the Project (assuming a 12% discount rate) is
US$14.2 million equivalent of which US$2.4 million is attributable to logging
and log exports, US$3.3 million to veneer production and US$8.5 million to
sawmilling.
8.03      The sensitivity of this result to possible changes in basic
assumptions, as detailed in the financial analysis (para 7.08), is tabulated
below. As shown, the economic rate of return remains satisfactory even under
rather adverse assumptions.

C. Other Benefits
8.04      There are a number of other important Project benefits which could not
be quantified in the above analysis. Most importantly, the Project will
contribute significantly to the development of Northern Congo. Direct
employment will be provided for 540 people, mostly in the Ouesso region, and
indirect employment (primarily in transportation) for an estimated additional
300 people. The investment per direct job created is US$73,300 equivalent. For
total employment, the investment per job is US$47,100. Although certain skilled
persons will have to be brought from Brazzaville, Pointe Noire and neighboring
countries to Ouesso, more than one half of the work-force will be recruited
locally. Local recruitment will include tribal people (pygmies), some of whom
are already working for SCBO in preparatory work for forestry operations.
8.05      At the national level, over its 17-year life, the Project will lead to
direct foreign exchange earnings (net of foreign debt service and production
costs) of about US$319 million in 1983 dollars. The rate of return on equity is
about 22%. The Government's direct share would be 51% of any dividends paid,
based on its current share capital holdings. In addition, the Government will
receive taxes throughout the life of the Project with a total present value of
US$4.08 million, while the OCB will obtain a mark-up on log sales revenue of
about 20% (para 4.14).
8.06      Finally, the Technical Assistance component to the Government includes
the provision of consulting and other services which will: (i) enable the
Ministry of Water and Forests to participate more actively in the various
forestry-related joint venture companies which come under the Ministry's
control, as well as to better supervise its public sector ventures; and



- 45 -
(ii) assist SCB0 to recruit and train local tribal people and provide valuable
base-line and social impact information concerning the integration of such
people into the SCBO Project and the northern economy in general. Neither the
costs nor the benefits associated with this component have been included in the
financial or economic analyses.  If the costs were included, and no benefits
claimed, the economic rate of return would decline by about 1%. However, this
component should generate significant returns to the economy.
D. Risks
8.07      There are certain risks associated with the project, specifically in
the fields of management, marketing and transport. The management of the
Project will be assured by an experienced, internationally recruited team, the
core members of which are already in place. To further compensate for the
partners' lack of previous experience: (i) a qualified engineering firm will be
responsible for advising SCBO on the selection of a turnkey contractor, as well
as the supervision of said contractor's construction and start-up of the plant;
(ii) the plant will be procured on a turnkey basis; including detailed design
engineering and with appropriate guarantees; and (iii) technical assistance will
be provided for the first two years of operation (para 5.31). In marketing
tropical wood, although Silos have no previous experience, the international
outlook for tropical hardwoods is good, and the volumes concerned are relatively
small. Veneer does, nonetheless, pose a potential problem, as noted in para
4.25. This is a risk which even on the downside, the project can reasonably be
expected to absorb without excessive financial or economic damage. Finally,
river and rail transport does pose a problem for existing wood producers;
however, two Bank financed projects aimed specifically at relieving these
bottlenecks are already underway, and the problem is expected to be resolved
before the proposed Project comes fully on-stream (paras 5.17, 5.19 and 5.21).
E. Policy Considerations and Conclusions
8.08      The proposed Project evolved from a forestry sector study, which
indicated that Congo's existing forest legislation was satisfactory (paras 1.05
and 2.13), and that further development of the sector merited Bank support. The
Government's capacity to supervise related industries and associated marketing
requires strengthening and would be addressed by the technical assistance
component to the Ministry of Water and Forests (para 5.38). Pygmies are
attracted to wage opportunities offered by forest and palm oil exploitations in
the North and are currently living in ghettos on the outskirts of these
encampments with no access to housing, education, health or other social
facilities offered by these enterprises, and with no hope of obtaining any but
the lowest paid jobs. Very little attention has been addressed to this problem
to date, and while the proposed Project could not hope to resolve it entirely,
the technical assistance component to SCBO and the Government to promote the
integration of tribal people (para 5.29) would constitute an essential first
step. Effective and equitable marketing will be ensured by the Project's
foreign partners under an agreement to be reviewed by the Bank prior to
signature as detailed in Chapter IV. Prices will be determined by world supply
and demand, and therefore subject to fluctuations, but sensitivity analyses of
both financial and economic returns (paras 7.08 and 8.03) show that the Project
can withstand the anticipated range of fluctuations. Although the possibility



- 46 -
of continuing transport problems cannot be ignored, attention is being focussed
on the major outstanding problems through the ongoing Bank-assisted railway and
river transport projects, whilst SCBO is analysing alternative routes and
systems. To ensure that the Project is implemented and operated effectively,
SCBO has agreed to engage the services of a qualified engineering firm to assist
them in evaluating, engaging and supervising the turnkey contract, whilst this
contract itself will include substantial engineering training plus initial
management and operating assistance. With this assistance, the base-case
projections concerning project costs and production should be met. In the event
of some short-fall in performance in these areas, the sensitivity analysis shows
that the returns from the Project should remain at acceptable levels.
IX. AGREEMENTS
9.01      Agreements have been reached with the Government of the Peoples'
Republic of the Congo that:
(i)   It shall take no action which would prevent SCB0 from being run as an
efficient commercial enterprise (para 3.02);
(ii)   It shall closely monitor the capacity of the transport facilities, and
shall take appropriate steps in a timely manner to secure additional
capacity as required (para 5.21);
(iii)   It shall implement the technical assistance components related to: (a)
ensuring the proper arrangements for the integration of tribal people
into the Project (para 5.30); and (b) strengthening the Government's
capacity in planning, implementing and supervising forest-related
joint-venture and public sector enterprises, including marketing (para
5.38); and
(iv)   It shall onlend to SCBO US$,10.5 million of the proceeds of the
proposed Bank loan of US$12.0 million under a subsidiary loan
agreement acceptable to the Bank (para 6.05).
9.02      Agreements have been reached with SCBO:
(i)   That it will provide for the Bank a Commercial Shareholders'
Agreement, confirming the individual undertakings of Silos and
Agro-Finance to fulfill their obligations to SCBO (para 3.07), and in
particular that any additional financing, including direct equity
investments of the shareholders will be provided if necessary to
complete the Project on satisfactory financing terms (para 6.04).
(ii)   That it will seek approval from the Bank on marketing agreements (para
4.26);
(iii)   That it will adhere to the financial covenants detailed in para 7.13;
and
(iv)    That it will adhere to the auditing and reporting provisions detailed
in para 7.14.



- 47 -
9.03      Based upon the above agreements, the Project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$12 million equivalent.
9.04      The conditions of loan effectiveness would be the execution of a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement and of a commercial Shareholders' Agreement (paras
6.04 and 6.05); and the effectiveness of the proposed suppliers credits, as well
as of the proposed loan from BNDC (para 6.06).

PROPOSED SCOPE OF WORK AND TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE FIRST PHASE
OF A TRIBAL COMPONENT OF THE CONGO OUESSO WOOD-PROCESSING PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       The Government of the People's Republic of Congo (the Government) has
requested World Bank assistance in financing a wood-processing project to be
implemented in the Sangha region of Northern Congo near the town of Ouesso. In
evaluating the scope of such assistance, the Government and the Bank have
determined the need for a "tribal component". The purpose of the work to be
performed under this contract is to develop the first phase of such a "tribal
component" designed to ensure that all inhabitants of the area to be affected by
the Ouesso Wood-Processing Project, and in particular those having the
characteristics of "tribal people," as defined by the Bank's OMS 2.34 will be
able to participate in the benefits of forestry development.
1.2       The Project is an integrated logging and wood-processing operation
with a 1.1 million hectare (ha) forest concession. The total volume extracted
will average 8-10 m3/ha, or less than 10 percent of the standing volume.
Approximately 100 km of all-weather roads will be constructed each year.
1.3       The Project will be owned and operated by a company created for this
purpose, La Societe Congolaise des Bois de Ouesso (SCBO). In the short term,
SCBO will provide direct employment for 540 people and will indirectly support
as many as 300 additional jobs in transport and agriculture. In the long term,
the Project is likely to affect the lives of a majority of the area's
inhabitants. It is to protect the interests of the least vocal of these that
the tribal component is envisaged.
1.4       The tribal component will have two phases.  The first phase is
expected to last about 18 months and the second phase, to continue to the end of
Project funding. Local social scientists will be used to the maximum possible
extent. The specific objectives of the first phase are to:
(a) Assess the social and economic costs and the potential benefits of
forestry development on the tribal population;
(b) Identify and implement pilot activities designed to improve the
access of all residents in the area to health, training, and
education services;
(c) Assist SCBO management in establishing open employment procedures,
ensuring wide access to employee benefits, and establishing
records.for monitoring progress in these areas; and



- 55 -                             ANNEX 5-1
Page 2 of 6
(d) Develop an action plan for the second phase of the tribal
component to be submitted to the Congolese Government and to the
Bank for review.
1.5       The content, magnitude, and mode of implementation of second phase
activities will be based on the findings of the first phase but are likely to
include: health services; basic education; job skills training; a site and
services component for company towns; and activities designed to improve tribal
peoples' access to employment and promotion.
II. TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE FIRST PHASE
A. Studies
2.1       The contractor, using local social scientists to the greatest possible
extent, will conduct studies to determine:
(a) The approximate total population of pygmies or other tribal
people resident in the area affected by the Project, and their
seasonal distribution between villages along the roads and
rivers, the forest, and company towns;
(b) The significance of ethnic or linguistic divisions within the
pygmy and other tribal populations and the extent to which they
know and can use common languages (Lingala and French);
(c) The size and composition by age and sex of households, bands, and
other groups that manage natural resources, share income, or pool
risks in the different types of tribal settlements;
(d) The sources of tribal household income and the ecological,
social, economic or other constraints on each;
(e) The relative significant of subsistence and commercial hunting,
gathering, agricultural employment with shifting
horticulturalists, wage labor, and other activities in the
seasonal income strategies of differing types of tribal
household/group;
(f) Dietary, nutritional, and health status of pygmies and other
tribal people in the area, by age, sex, residence, income
strategy, and income level, in comparison with the non-tribal
population.
(g) The relative impact of recent ecological and economic change and
settlement due to forestry development on the income strategies,
diet, and health of tribal, as against non-tribal, people in the
area;



- 56 -                            ANNEX 5-1
Page 3 of 6
(h)  The problems faced by tribal people who seek to obtain and retain
employment in forestry work or other forms of wage labor as
compared with the non--tribal population;
(i)  Constraints affecting the access of tribal, as against
non-tribal, people to health and education services in the area;
2.2       The contractor will submit to the Congolese Government and to the Bank
the following reports:
(a)  A progress report and summary of preliminary findings, six months
after the commencemeni: of study;
(b)  An interim report of findings, 12 months after the commencement
of study;
(c)  A final report of findings including an "Action Plan" at the end
of 18 months.
B. Pilot Activities
2.3       Approximately six months af-ter the inception of studies the contractor
will submit a report to the Congolese Government and to the Bank that will
identify:
(a)  One or more small-scale, low budget pilot activities designed to
improve the access of tribal people to health services, food,
consumer goods, training, education, or other desired goods or
services;
(b)  An existing Government: agency, commercial enterprise, or private
voluntary organization through which the pilot activity can be
implemented.
2.4       Following Government and Bank approval, the pilot activities will be
implemented. They will be funded, monitored, and evaluated by the contractor.
2.5       Progress reports on the activities will be submitted to the Congolese
Government and to the Bank every four months and a final evaluation report will
be submitted at the end of the first phase.
C. Advisory Services to SCBO and Government
2.6       The contractor will work with the management of SCBO to:
(a)  Establish policies and objectives for recruiting, training, and
upgrading the skills of workers from all segments of the local
population (with special attention to pygmies);
(b)  Determine whether alternative contractual arrangements or methods
of compensation would be more consistent with employees'
mixed-income strategies and would hence reduce absenteeism and
turnover;



ANNEX 5-1
Page 4 of 6
(c) Ensure that SCBO employee benefits are accessible to all
employees and their dependents, on an equitable basis;
(d) Establish training in literacy, numeracy, and other skills
required by SCBO for promotion to semi-skilled and skilled
positions;
(e) Establish record-keeping and reporting procedures within SCBO to
provide data on employment, training, and use of employee
benefits for purposes of monitoring and evaluation by the
Government and the Bank.
2.7       A report on advisory services to SCBO will be submitted to the
Government and the Bank every four months and at the end of the first phase, in
association with the reports on pilot activities and the final report on the
first phase.
D. Action Plan and Policy Guidelines
2.8       Eighteen months after the commencement of work, the contractor will
submit a detailed action plan for the second phase of the tribal component to
the Congolese Government and to the Bank for consideration. The plan will be
based on information from the studies, the evaluation of pilot activities, and
experience with SCBO management. The plan will:
(a) Assess qualitatively and quantitatively the immediate and
long-term costs and potential benefits of forestry development
for tribal peoples as against other groups of population in the
areas of income, nutrition, health, housing and sanitation,
education, employment, and self-respect;
(b) Determine the types of activity and level of effort necessary to
mitigate negative impacts and realize potential benefits, and
evaluate their appropriateness in the economic and social context
of the region and the nation, and reach appropriate
recommendations;
(c) Establish the logistics and cost, the approach, objectives,
targets, and timetable for each recommended activity;
(d) Identify agencies with the capacity to implement these activities
in the Ouesso project area (including governmental agencies,
NGOs, or other development entities); and

CONGO - OUESSO WOOD-PROCESSING PROJECT
Assumptions Used in Financial Projections
1.        The financial projections have been prepared in current terms through
1985, the first full year of operation for all facilities, and at constant
mid-1985 prices thereafter. Prices and production costs have been escalated
from the April 1982 base at the following annual rates:
Year                      Annual Escalation Rate
Foreign    Local
1982                           8.0%        14%
1983                           8.0%        14%
1984                           7.5%        12%
1985                           7.0%        10%
2.        It has been assumed that log exports will begin in 1983, commercial
operation of the sawmill in March 1985, and commercial operation of the veneer
plant in mid-1985.
3.        After making adequate allowances for operating efficiencies and
maintenance downtime, the sustainable annual output from the sawmill is 23,000
m3 and from the veneer plant, 4,200 m3 . Full production at these levels will
be achieved in 1986.  Production in the intermediate start-up years would be as
follows:
Production
(m3)
Year            Logs          Sawnwood         Veneer
1983           50,000
1984          100,000             -               -
1985          100,000           9,900           1,300
1986          100,000          23,000           4,200
1987          100,000          23,000           4,200
Further detail on sales volumes and the build-up of inventories is shown in
Annex 7-2.
4.        The project has been assumed to operate for a total of 15 years after
the start-up of the sawmill and veneer plant, up to and including the year 1998.
5.        Average product prices for the anticipated grade mix, at 1983 levels,
are as follows:
Product                     Average Price (CFAF/m3)
Logs (at Pointe Noire)                       37,700
Sawnwood
- Domestic (at Brazzaville)                  60,000
- Export (at Pointe Noire)                   98,200
Veneer (at Pointe Noire)                    261,800
Revenue projections for subsequent years are shown in Annex 4-5.



ANNEX 7-1
- 64 -                            Page 2 of 2
6.        Production cost estimates at full production, based on 1982 price
levels, are shown in Annex 7-3. Projections of annual production costs at
current price levels through 1985 and at constant 1985 price levels thereafter,
taking into account the rate of build-up of production, are shown in the Income
Statement (Annex 7-4).
7.        Plant capital has been depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
15-year life of the Project.  Logging equipment has been depreciated assuming an
average 5-year life. Tax concessions are still being negotiated between the
Government and SCBO, but for this analysis, it has been assumed that the Project
would qualify for a five-year tax holiday. However, from the start of
operations, an export tax amounting to CFAF 500 has also been incorporated in
the projections.
8.        Terms of the loans to SCBO have been assumed to be as follows:
World
Bank        SEB       COFACE       BNDC
Amount (CFAF million)          3,570       1,500       2,646       1,100
Interest Rate (%)              12.06       11.64       10.00       13.00
Front-end Fee (%)               0.25        1.75        0.50           -
Commitment Fee (%)              0.75        0.50        0.50        0.90
Grace Period (years)               4           1           2           2
Repayment Period (years)           11           2           7          5
9.        Average freight costs have been developed from published tariffs as
follows:
Freight Charges in CFAF/m3
Rafted      Barged     Local    Export
Logs       Logs    Sawnwood  Sawnwood    Veneer
Ouesso to Brazzaville       6,450      10,920      4,080      8,840      12,260

Rail to Pointe Noire        6,320       6,320        -        6,120       5,100
Taxes                       1,870       3,160      2,970     3,490       5,280

It has been assumed that 10% of the logs would be barged, the balance rafted.
10.       For financial rate of return calculations, all cost and benefit
streams have been brought to a constant 1982 basis using the projected rates of
inflation shown in paragraph 1.

overall effect is a reduction of 2.7% in the overall project cost.
2.        Production costs have been adjusted as follows:
(i)   Taxes have been eliminated from freight costs which have then been
increased by 15% to more closely approximate actual economic transport
costs. This adjustment is based on information contained in the Staff
Appraisal Report of the recent Bank supported River Transport Project
(Report No. 3196-COB);
(ii)   Unskilled labor, representing some 40% of the total labor, has been
shadow-priced at two thiuds of its financial cost; and
(iii)   An economic value of CFAF 1800 (equivalent to about US$5.30 per m3)
has been assigned to standing timber, calculated from economic product
values after deducting economic extraction, conversion and
transportation costs, and a 15% pre-tax return on equity investment in
Project facilities.
The net effect of all of these adjustments is an increase of 4.4% in annual
production costs.
3.        Selling prices have not been adjusted.  Apart from the small amount of
sawnwood sold domestically, the products are sold at international prices.
4.        Individual adjustments and the resultant net economic benefit stream
are shown in Annex 8-2.
