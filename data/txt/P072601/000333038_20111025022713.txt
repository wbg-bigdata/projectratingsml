                     Implementation Completion and Results Report


1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country Background. At the time of appraisal, about three quarters of the
population and 85% of the poor lived in rural areas, where agriculture remained the main
source of income. The Government was committed to improving rural conditions, and
had launched a series of measures, including market liberalization and provision of
infrastructure. Because of the small farm sizes, sustained agricultural growth needed to
be combined with increased non-farm employment in order to reduce rural poverty. This
required a substantial investment by the private sector, supported by adequate financial
services. At the same time, the financial sector was still dominated by the State-Owned
Commercial Banks (SOCBs) and characterized by minimal competition, low levels of
equity, large volumes of non-performing loans, inadequate provisions for loan losses, low
profitability and insufficient banking knowledge and experience of the staff. Because the
liberalization of the banking sector was relatively recent, private banks were small, urban
based and focused on short term trade loans. One consequence was that rural areas did
not receive adequate term financing.

2.       Rationale for Bank Assistance. The project supported the Bank’s Country
Assistance Strategy (FY02) by (i) contributing directly to poverty alleviation and
equitable growth; (ii) accelerating rural development through financing of rural small and
medium private investments, and (iii) strengthening the financial sector. It built on the
achievements of the First Rural Finance Project (FRFP) and provided the resources and
institutional framework for accelerating lending to rural areas so as to diversify rural
investments and create off-farm employment. It was also the most market-driven donor-
funded project in the country, and provided a platform for deepening the country dialog
on financial-sector issues, especially with the central bank, the State Bank of Vietnam
(SBV) and the participating financial institutions. It was consistent with the
Government’s conviction that to accelerate rural poverty reduction required (i) an
increased flow of loans for rural investments, and (ii) improved capacity and stability of
the financial institutions operating in rural areas.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators

3.    The Project was to assist the Government in its efforts to develop the rural
economy and improve the living conditions in the rural areas through:

   (a) encouraging investments of farm households and private rural entrepreneurs;



                                            1
    (b) strengthening the banking system’s capacity to better service the rural economy;
    (c) increasing access of the rural poor to financial services.

4.      The development objectives were to be measured through a series of Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs). The KPIs focused on achieving the three specific
development objectives indicated above. They dealt with: (i) financing of rural
investments; (ii) strengthening of the capacity of the Bank for Investment and
Development of Vietnam (BIDV) to manage wholesale banking operations as an apex
bank; (iii) upgrading of the operational capacity of participating financial institutions
(PFIs) in rural areas; and (iv) accomplishment of their Institutional Development Plans
(IDPs) by the PFIs, including financial ratios which reflect progress with regard to
solvency, liquidity, resource mobilization, profitability and management. Annex 11 of
the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) defined all KPIs for both the credit component
and the institutional strengthening component, and also provided a detailed matrix and
calculation method for the determination of project classification at completion, as a
weighted average of these KPIs – a rather mechanical approach.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

5.      While no revision was made to the PDOs, some minor adjustments were made to
the KPIs. In 2005, the SBV issued two decisions1 on prudential regulations, which
required that the PFI performance indicators be changed to reflect these. This minor
revision did not require a formal amendment of the project, since the revised KPIs
measure the same areas of financial performance and still adhere to international
standards.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

6.      The main targeted beneficiaries of the project were individual farm households
and private micro-, small- and medium-scale entrepreneurs (MSMEs) in Viet Nam’s rural
areas. It was estimated that about 175,000 economic entities would benefit from the
credit component, including 90,000 from the Rural Development Fund (RDF) II and
85,000 from the Micro-finance Loan Fund (MLF), and that 50,000 new jobs would be
created. In addition, a vast number of remote and rural clients were expected to be served
through new mobile banking units of VBARD (172 units) and BIDV (71 units).

7.      The second group of beneficiaries comprised the financial institutions involved,
consisting of BIDV as the apex bank and the PFIs, including the Government owned
Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD), which has been by far
the largest provider of credit in rural areas. All PFIs were expected to improve their loan
collections and the quality of their services. BIDV and VBARD were to also improve
their capital adequacy, profitability and the term structure of their deposits (by increasing

the share of deposits with longer maturities), and to reduce their exposure to state-owned
enterprises as clients.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

8.     The project, to be implemented over five years, comprised two components, each
with two sub-components.

Component 1: Line of Credit

9.      The credit component consisted of RDF II and the MLF. The two funds were
wholesale operations managed by the apex bank, BIDV, following a Policy Manual
satisfactory to IDA. The Policy Manual covered (a) management of the funds; (b)
eligible sub-projects; (c) accreditation criteria for PFIs; (d) terms and conditions of
subsidiary and sub-loans; and (e) environmental protection, audit, supervision and
reporting. The proceeds from the repayments of principal to both RDF II and the MLF
were to be revolved as fresh loans to PFIs, under the same terms and conditions as the
first loans, to be used for addition sub-loans; no estimations on the expected amounts
from this were included in the PAD, as this would continue well beyond the project
closing.

10.     Rural Development Fund II (US$257.2 million). This facility provided lines of
credit (mainly medium term) for rural investments. The funds were to be made available
by BIDV to PFIs, for on-lending to households and MSMEs for investments in
agriculture and other viable rural businesses. The operation was to obey market forces,
including a market-determined interest rate. PFIs had discretion to select projects and
clients, with no predetermined sectoral or other allocation. All regions and provinces
were eligible except the four main cities of Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hai Phong and Da
Nang. (While an agricultural area is included within the Hanoi municipality, it already
had better access to credit than other rural areas.)

11.      Micro-finance Loan Fund (US$ 36.2 million). In most operational regards, the
MLF followed similar principles as the RDF. Accredited Micro-Finance Institutions
(MFIs) that met a set of eligibility criteria could obtain financing from the fund for on-
lending to their clients. In theory, not only banks but also other types of institutions such
as rural cooperatives and NGOs could become MFIs; in practice, all of the MFIs and PFIs
turned out to be banks,, because adequate regulations were not in place for other lending
institutions. In terms of loan conditions, the main difference from the RDF was that sub-
loan ceilings of US$400 for individuals and of US$1,000 for micro-enterprises
(employing at least two non-family persons) were introduced for the MLF so as to better
target the rural poor.




Component 2: Institutional Strengthening



                                             3
12.     BIDV (US$2.2 million). BIDV was to be restructured as an apex bank, with its
IDP supported by technical assistance (TA) and training under the project. Its IDP
covered: (i) parallel application of the Vietnamese Accounting Standards (VAS) and the
International Accounting Standards (IAS); (ii) portfolio cleaning and bad debt write offs;
(iii) compliance with international standards on equity capital; (iv) lending, internal
control and audit systems; (v) profitability; (vi) governance; (vii) mobilizing more
longer-term deposits to better match its loan maturities; and (viii) reducing exposure to
state-directed loans. In short, it was to be transformed into a modern wholesale bank.

13.      PFIs (US$ 2.6 million) IDPs for all PFIs (including MFIs) were developed that
addressed their main weaknesses in meeting the accreditation criteria, including:
(i) building up their capital and deposit base; (ii) improving solvency, liquidity,
profitability and portfolio quality; (iii) expanding outreach; and (iv) improving staff
capacity through training. For VBARD, because of its importance especially as an MFI,
a more comprehensive IDP was prepared including: (i) improvements in lending systems,
in particular a reduction of lending to state-owned enterprises; (ii) introduction of the IAS
(to be used in parallel with the VAS); (iii) increasing equity to international levels;
(iv) greater profitability; (v) better governance and internal control systems; and
(vi) mobilizing more longer-term deposits to better match its loan maturities. To support
these IDPs, the project financed training programs and provided technical assistance
(TA), based on demand from PFIs. In addition, the project financed mobile banking
vehicles to enable VBARD and BIDV to provide financial services to remote areas.

1.6 Revised Components

None

1.7 Other significant changes

14.      The main change was that as a result of the depreciation of the USD against the
SDR, the credit of SDR 160.2 million, which was equivalent to USD 200.0 million at
Board approval, became worth USD 236.4 million (+17%). Because of the high demand
for institutional strengthening, from BIDV and otherPFIs the funding for this component
was more than doubled. The closing date was extended from Sept. 2008 to Sept 2009 to
enable the increased funds for institutional strengthening to be spent. One other change
is that the original requirement that BIDV finance 10% of RDF II was dropped, because
the Bank agreed that BIDV should focus on managing the overall project, and there was
adequate cofinancing from the PFIs.

1.8 Original Project Costs and Financing

15.    Project cost was estimated at appraisal at USD 298.2 million, with 67% to be
funded by IDA, 15% by the sub-borrowers, 10% by the PFIs and 10% by BIDV (Table
1).

16.     The actual financing shares turned out rather differently. For RDF II, the 10%
BIDV share was dropped, and the IDA share of investment costs turned out to be 54%
rather than 65%. The PFIs’ put up 12% instead of the projected 10%, but the main
difference was in the share of the sub-borrowers, which turned out to be 34% instead of
the projected 15%. This presumably was the result of caution on both the part of the sub-
borrowers (not wanting to assume too much debt) and of the PFIs (requiring a greater
financial commitment from their clients). There was a relatively similar change in the
financing of MLF investments, with the IDA share being 54% instead of the projected
77%, while both sub-borrowers and the MFIs put up much more than expected
(respectively 24% rather than 13%, and 22% instead of10%).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of Background Analysis

17.      The background analysis for the project was sound and adequately addressed the
rural conditions and financial sector status of Vietnam, including the weaknesses of the
financial institutions and the importance of additional rural term finance. The design also
took into consideration the lessons derived from the FRFP: (i) RDF II designed to support
capital investment with associated working capital, (ii) BIDV replaced SBV as the apex
bank, (iii) capacity building of PFIs was emphasized and (iv) increasing competition in
rural financial services became an important objective.

18.      Assessment of project design. Project design, with only one responsible
institution (BIDV), two components and a total of four sub-components, was easy to
implement and adequate to address the issues, especially as the project provided a
platform for continuing the broader financial sector dialog with the Government. Clearly
defined KPIs helped all parties to understand the expectations, and BIDV to monitor
outcomes, and the project was within the management capacity of BIDV. The approach
of stimulating competition for rural term finance was sound, and it attracted a good
number of banks, with both regional and national scope, that had previously focused only
on urban areas. The exclusion of the four major metropolitan areas was fully justified to


                                            5
preserve a focus on rural areas. The mobile banking units were an appropriate instrument
to improve outreach to hitherto un-served areas that would not warrant the establishment
of a full branch or service centre. The concept of the IDPs to encourage banks to reflect
on their weaknesses and future challenges, develop plans to overcome these and
undertake concrete steps to realize these plans was solid and based on good international
practice.

19.      Borrower commitment and stakeholder involvement. The project was
requested and actively supported by the central bank, SBV, which had agreed to transfer
implementation of lending activities to commercial banks and withdraw from these
activities so as to concentrate on core central bank activities. BIDV, the implementing
agency, emerged as a bank with high potential to transform itself into an apex bank
capable of providing wholesale banking services to other commercial banks. VBARD,
which had already benefited under the FRFP, was equally committed to the project and
its objectives, and to continuing its transformation into a true commercial bank, whereas
formerly it had functioned largely as a Government cashier.

20.      Risks assessment. The main risks identified were: (i) failing investments;
(ii) fewer new jobs created than projected; (iii) low demand for funds; (iv) BIDV not
implementing its own IDP; and (v) failure to improve the enabling environment. The
first risk was rated as negligible, and the others as modest. The overall risk rating in the
PAD was therefore modest. The risk of failing investments was under-rated, given both
the weather hazards in Vietnam (a potentially serious problem chiefly for crops and their
processing) and the transformation taking place from a command to a market economy.
This was a more serious risk, in terms of both probability and impact, than the creation of
fewer jobs, for example. Except for this, the identification and assessment of risks was
appropriate, as were the proposed risk mitigation measures.

Adequacy of Participatory Processes

21.    The participatory process during the design process was adequate, with all
important stakeholders involved, especially the SBV, BIDV and VBARD, plus the PFIs
involved in the FRFP. Consultation was also made with the Vietnam Women’s Union
(VWU) and non-governmental organizations which are active in micro-finance in
Vietnam.

Quality Assurance Group (QAG) and Quality at Entry.

22.    No Quality at Entry review was conducted for this project.

2.2 Implementation

23.     Project implementation was generally satisfactory, due to the: (i) high-level
commitment of BIDV to manage the project, as evidenced especially by their providing
sufficient qualified staff and financial resources to the Project Management Unit (PMU);
and to BIDV’s execution of internal restructuring measures as specified in the IDP; (ii)


                                             6
willingness of private banks to become PFIs and to adopt the instrument of IDPs as their
own vision and implement the recommendations; (iii) high demand for sub-loans; and
(iv) solid supervision and technical support from both the Bank and BIDV.

24.     On the negative side, the global financial crisis hurt the project’s ability to fully
achieve its KPIs: (i) it made many depositors shift their term investments to short-term
liquid instruments, so as to retain control over their funds in a situation where the
Government pursued a credit rationing policy; this affected the ability of all PFIs,
including BIDV, to mobilize deposits with a duration above one year; (ii) the increase of
interest rates of deposits coupled with a temporary cap on interest rates on loans, as a
result of efforts by the National Assembly to reduce the impacts of the global financial
crisis on Vietnam, lowered the profitability of the banks in Vietnam; and (iii) the increase
in Government spending, as a stimulus mechanism, limited its ability to allocate funds for
capital increases of the SOCBs. Fortunately, while the global financial crisis affected the
PFIs’ ability to meet their financial goals, it had little effect on the growth of Vietnam’s
rural economy or on the demand for sub-loans.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

25.     The project had a generally sound and comprehensive set of KPIs to measure both
the outputs and outcomes for the PFIs. As regards the PFIs, while it is a good practice to
encourage their financial performance to match international standards, some of the KPIs
were too ambitious, such as the capital adequacy ratio requirement for both BIDV and
VBARD, which were beyond the project’s influence and the banks’ own control. There
were also two minor errors in the PAD. The PDO statement and the associated outcome
indicators were not identical between the main text and Annex 1, although they were
roughly similar. And one of the outcome indicators, “BIDV, PFIs and MFIs including
VBARD to submit their IDP and related training program,? actually measured output
instead.

26.     M&E implementation and utilization were satisfactory. BIDV engaged sufficient
qualified staff with adequate computers and appropriate software to handle project
monitoring and reporting. The quarterly progress reports on lending and training, the
semiannual reports on institutional performance and the mid-term review report, as
stipulated in the covenants, were always submitted by BIDV on time and with an
acceptable quality. After project completion, BIDV carried out a sample survey of 212
sub-borrowers that provided useful information on project impact.

27.    The M&E reports were the basis for all assessments and recommendations of the
supervision missions. The monitoring reports were instrumental in identifying critical and
unresolved issues, and to the decisions ultimately made by the Bank and BIDV. The
methodological soundness and quality of the data were satisfactory, in particular as
regards loan transactions and financial flows between the PFIs and their clients.

28.   Due to the nature of this Operation which supports thousands of scattered rural
households and enterprises, its not feasible to measure overall rural income impact



                                             7
through the Project. Nevertheless, this constraint has been addressed by       a pair of
impact assessments based on sample surveys, that were not built into the original project
design, but instead added by the Bank during implementation. The first one was done in
2005 by Arthur D. Little (ADL), and the second in 2010 by the PMU in BIDV with
cooperation from the PFIs. These provide much of the confidence that the project was
indeed successful at its primary objectives of increasing rural incomes and employment.
The survey by BIDV, while apparently objective, would have benefited (at least in terms
of credibility) from the involvement of an independent outside party.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

29.     The main safeguard and fiduciary arrangements under the project were:
(i) environmental safeguards; (ii) social safeguards; (iii) procurement rules; and (iv)
financial management regulations. All of these were regularly reviewed by Bank staff
and found to be generally in compliance.

Environmental Safeguards

30.     The project provided a breakthrough in treatment of environmental issues in rural
credit projects. Although the PAD did not anticipate high environmental risks from the
small investments to be funded, the sub-project included environmental guidelines for the
PFIs, and all borrowers were required to pledge that their investments would not have a
negative environmental impact. This was the first time in Vietnam that commercial banks
incorporated an environment commitment as part of their sub-loan appraisal process.
Project management then went beyond this and added environmental training of PFI
managers and credit officers involved in loan appraisal. While initially there was
reluctance by some PFIs and borrowers to require and sign the environmental safeguard
pledges, respectively, over time this has become a routine procedure for most PFIs. The
Bank’s supervision missions and BIDV’s Project Management Unit (PMU) increased the
appreciation of the need for environmental protection. At completion, some PFIs even
stated that clients had begun to view this competence in environmental matters and norms
as an added-value provided by the PFI, which would give it an edge over competitors.
The PMU commissioned environmental audits by two independent environment
consulting firms, in 2006 and 2007. The results confirmed the positive findings
mentioned above, and found no major non-compliance. The second and more detailed
audit visited 521 sub-projects, and found that of the 327 sub-projects for which it would
be best practice to have pollution control facilities, such as household-level livestock
waste treatment, 268 had installed acceptable waste treatment facilities. This is a
remarkably high compliance rate for small farmers.

Social Safeguards

31.     Here too, although there was no social safeguard policy triggered under this
project, special efforts were made, in this case to increase women’s participation. PFIs
were required to monitor and collect gender-disaggregated information. The project also
encouraged establishment of a partnership between VBARD and the Vietnam Women’s



                                           8
Union (VWU), which focused on outreach to women borrowers to increase their credit
access and payment management, including through the creation and strengthening of
credit groups that can obtain loans through social collateral. Some 37% of all sub-loans
were made to women, with the proportion by PFI ranging from 10% to 50% in the case of
RDF II and 13% to 67% in the case of the MLF. Some 42% of VBARD’s RDF clients
and 39% of its MLF clients were women.

Procurement

32.     Both BIDV and VBARD had considerable experience in procurement, as
evidenced in the Procurement Capacity Assessment done before project effectiveness.
The IDA credit was on-lent to private entities, and procurement followed commercial
practices. Only limited TA and goods had to be procured, for the institutional
strengthening component. No violation of procurement regulation or any major issues
related to procurement emerged during project implementation.

Financial Management

33.     The project financial management was rated satisfactory throughout. The audit
reports and audited financial statements were submitted to the Bank on time and with
unqualified opinions.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

34.     Key government agencies and financial institutions decided to build on the
successful outcome of the SRFP with a follow-on Third Rural Finance Project (TRFP),
which became effective in 2009. The TRFP offers an opportunity to sustain the dialog
on key institutional issues, which require long-term engagement. It adds strengthening of
People’s Credit Fund Association (financial co-operatives) and the Small and Medium
Enterprise Association, and develops new financial products for rural Vietnam. A US$7
million TA component is being on-lent to VBARD to address recommendations made
under the SRFP on overall risk management and branch office efficiency. Profitability,
capital adequacy and compliance with IAS are also further pursued by the TRFP. As
evidence that the country dialog is paying dividends, the Government has recently agreed
on fresh capital injections into BIDV and VBARD, and has removed interest rate caps on
lending by commercial banks.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

35.     The objectives, design and implementation of the SRFP were and remain relevant
to the policies and priorities of the Government as well as to those of the Bank. Vietnam
has made a hugely successful effort at poverty alleviation (the incidence of poverty
declined from 58% in 1993 to 16% in 2006), and the SRFP contributed to this. At the
same time, it was reforming its financial sector by narrowing the role of the SBV to its



                                           9
core central banking function, improving the financial status of the SOCBs, and opening
up the sector to increased competition. The SRFP was part of these important efforts.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

36.     The central PDO was “to develop the rural economy and improve the living
conditions in the rural areas.? The key measure of this would be the increase in incomes
of the sub-borrowers. The two studies carried out, by ADL in 2005 and by BIDV in 2010,
based on interviews with samples of sub-borrowers, gave very similar results – income
increases that averaged 60% in the first study and 65% in the second. These results were
largely independent of the size of the sub-loans. The larger sub-loans were chiefly for
services, the smaller RDF II ones for services and livestock/aquaculture, the MLF ones
for livestock/aquaculture and crops. Given that by the closing date, the project, including
roll-over of funds, had financed some 170,000 families through RDF II and 275,000
families through MLF, with a geographic balance throughout rural Vietnam, the project
clearly fulfilled this objective well.

37.     The first subsidiary PDO was “encouraging investments of farm households and
private rural entrepreneurs? as indicated by an increase of term lending by PFIs to the
private sector in rural areas. At the time of accreditation, the term loans in rural areas
outstanding from 20 PFIs (the only ones we have data on) was VND 11.5 trillion,
accounting for 12.0 % of their total rural portfolio. By project closing, rural term loans of
these 20 banks had increased to VND 159.2 trillion (US$8.7 billion), and accounted for
38.3% of all rural loans outstanding. The SRFP itself financed only about 3% of this
(although it equaled over one-third of the rural term lending outstanding at the time of
appraisal), but its influence through strengthening and re-orienting the PFIs was much
greater. These changes represent a significant improvement in the quality and range of
rural services offered by the banks. In the interviews by ADL, 77% of borrowers said that
they would not have been able to carry out their business plans without loans from the
SRFP; the ex-post survey by BIDV in had an almost identical statistic for this – 75%.

38.      The second subsidiary PDO was “increasing access of the rural poor to financial
services? as indicated by increased MFI lending and financial services to individual
working poor and micro-enterprises. For 5 MFIs (including the largest, VBARD), the
loans outstanding (including short-term) to this target group increased from VND 50.3
trillion at accreditation to VND 177.8 trillion (US$9.7 billion) at project closing, an
increase of 254%. It is highly positive that during a period of rapid expansion of lending
in the entire economy, the expansion of lending to the rural poor and micro-entrepreneurs
almost kept pace with the overall expansion rate of rural lending. Furthermore, there was
a dramatic increase in competition in rural areas among commercial banks; whereas
VBARD accounted for 73% of the on-lending in RDF I, its share of RDF II ended up
down to 34%.

39.     The third subsidiary PDO was “strengthening the banking system’s capacity to
better service the rural economy,? as indicated by the submission and implementation by
BIDV and PFIs of their IDP and the related training programs. (This indicator actually



                                             10
measured a project output and not an outcome, which would be the impact of the IDP and
training program.) BIDV and all 25 PFIs at early stages of project implementation
prepared IDPs, which were closely monitored during project implementation. The senior
managers of PFIs visited all indicated that the IDP has helped them focus on the specific
areas to be improved, towards achieving international standards. As such, all PFIs have
significantly improved their risk and credit management systems, and widened their
range of services. In some cases, the improved MIS helped the banks to attract strategic
investors as shareholders. Due to the global financial crisis, compliance with the six
project accreditation indicators was lower in September 2009 than in the two previous
years (although still much higher than at accreditation); however, the PFIs have more
recently reportedly been able to again improve gradually. Taking into consideration the
increasing competition among financial institutions and the interest caps under which the
banks operated temporarily after the global financial crisis, the total incremental profits
of the PFIs of USD 10.9 million (and the USD 2.6 million incremental tax revenues for
the Government) also indicate a financial strengthening of the banking system.

40.     In summary, the extent to which the PDOs have been achieved was “highly
satisfactory." Details on the achievement of outputs are in Annex 2.




                                            11
3.3 Efficiency

41.     The best measure of efficiency for a credit project is the rates of return on the sub-
projects. For the 20 sub-loans larger than $100,000 completed by project closing, the
projected weighted average (weighted by loan size) Financial Rate of Return (FRR) was
22.4%. All sub-loans larger than $50,000 had at least a 15% projected FRR. For 26 sub-
projects with sub-loans exceeding $50,000, BIDV calculated ex-post a weighted average
FRR of 21%, with 23 of the projects in the 15-30% range. Thus the ex-post calculations
were very much in line with the ex-ante ones. For 84 RDF II sub-loans of below
$50,000, the weighted average ex-post FRR was also 21%, although the dispersal was
somewhat wider. For 82 MLF sub-loans, the weighted average ex-post FRR was
calculated at 63% (although the median sub-project had a return of about half that).
These small sub-loans were of 10-15 month duration, and mostly for livestock and crops.

42.     Another indicator of the projects’ financial success is the repayment rate on sub-
loans, which has been outstanding. The year end average proportions of past due loans
have remained below 1% for both RDF II and the MLF, and did not even increase
significantly during the global financial crisis. Such repayment results suggest both
excellent appraisals by the PFIs and high subsequent profit rates by the investors. The
one possible caveat is that roll-over loans might have been used by PFIs to obscure
repayment problems; however, there is no indication of this.

43.     In terms of impact on job creation, the ex-ante calculations showed an average of
1.6 jobs to be created per RDF II sub-loan, or an average sub-project cost of $2,500 per
job created. (No similar calculations were done for MLF.) The results of BIDV’s ex-post
sample survey were not quite as good for RDF II, but still very satisfactory: for sub-loans
above US$50,000, the average investment per job created was US$15,000; for smaller
RDF II projects, the average was US$4,100, and for MLF projects, it was a mere
US$520. Some two-thirds of the MLF job creation was outside of the family; one can,
however, question whether the respondents were really referring to full-time, permanent
jobs. Adjusting for sub-loan size, BIDV’s ex-post results imply total job creation,
including from roll-over loans, of some 150-250,000 jobs from RDF II projects, and a
comparable number from the much smaller MLF. In any case, job creation was far above
the 50,000 estimated in the PAD.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

44.     The overall rating of the project outcomes is “highly satisfactory.? By applying
the scoring system for the KPIs and the relative weight allocated for each of these2 for the
assessment at completion, as laid down in the PAD, the numeric score is 3.52 (out of a
possible 4), as shown in the table below. This is midway between “satisfactory? and
“highly satisfactory.? In this case, the high benefits accruing to the sub-borrowers, which
was the underlying PDO, are sufficient to tip the rating to “highly satisfactory.?

45.     The results under the credit component are “highly satisfactory,? as are many
other elements. The institutional strengthening component as a whole, however, is rated
only as “satisfactory? given delays in its implementation and the fact that several of the
financial ratios, especially the ones related to the capital adequacy and the nature of the
deposits in BIDV and VBARD, were unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

46.     The poverty impact was not measured directly under the M&E framework.
However, the ADL and BIDV sample studies indicated 60-65% increases in the income
of beneficiaries, under both RDF II and the MLF. There were some 275,000 MLF sub-
loans with an average amount below US$ 350, with most of these presumably going to
the poor. Of these, 32% of the funding to the poorest region, the Northern Midlands and
Mountains, while 43% went to the relatively poor Red River Delta, which, while having a
relatively lower poverty rate, includes a large absolute number of poor households.

47.     The involvement of women as direct borrowers has been satisfactory, with 37%
of all sub-loans disbursed going to female borrowers, and with this share differing only
marginally between the RDF II and the MLF. One reason for this success is that VBARD
has actively worked with the Women’s Union.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

48.     On financial sector issues, the project has been an important complement to the
broader TA provided by the financial sector team and the IMF. It has helped the Bank to
build a strong partnership with the financial institutions in Vietnam and to implement on
the ground the agreed policy initiatives. It has been instrumental in achieving significant
improvements at individual banks. The PFIs, which constitute the majority of banks in
the country, have benefited from the institution-building component that has enabled
them to get (i) training in areas where they experienced significant skills gaps; (ii) TA to
develop know-how in important banking areas and (iii) IDPs that have helped them
improve operational and financial performance. The TA program has also had a major
impact on the strategy framework, governance, operational structure and human
resources strategy of VBARD, Vietnam’s biggest bank. The project’s emphasis on
improving the institutional capacity of banks came at the right time, i.e. shortly before
capital adequacy became an issue in banking regulation, and before capital injections
were made nearly compulsory for private banks. The commercial banks that discovered
the benefits of rural lending are likely to remain engaged there, unless profitability
parameters change drastically.

49.      But the greatest institutional change was undoubtedly in BIDV. The training, TA
support, and the continuous policy dialogue and advice from the Bank have transformed
it into one of the strongest and most transparent financial institutions in Vietnam, and the
first one to get a Moody’s credit rating. BIDV has used the PMU strategically, as a
training ground for managers and junior staff with high potential.

50.   The capacity to handle term loans has substantially improved among all PFIs. The
emphasis on mobilizing longer term deposits and the business opportunities deriving
from offering longer term loans are likely to remain important among PFIs. Other



                                            14
positive changes are the reduction of loans to SOEs and the reduced dependency on
deposits from the public sector in BIDV and VBARD.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

51.     This is the very first operation in Vietnam requiring commercial banks to apply
environmental standards for sub-loans. Several workshops took place on this topic, and
key stakeholders including the central bank and the Ministry of Natural Resources
Management (MORNE) welcomed the project initiative. SBV has encouraged all other
financial institutions to follow these practices, and MORNE has incorporated the
project’s environment compliance modalities into the revised environment regulations.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

52.    There were beneficiary surveys by ADL before the mid-term review, involving
500 sub-borrowers, and by BIDV after project completion, of 212 sub-borrowers. the
main findings are remarkably similar and positive, and have been covered above. Other
points worth noting are:

       • 30% of the sub-borrowers were first-time borrowers;
       • The vast majority of sub-borrowers (86%) were happy with the services
         received from the bank; the processing time was usually just 7-10 days;
       • Few sub-borrowers had difficulties in repaying their loans; the few problems
         were caused by a deteriorating business environment or natural disasters;
       • About 60% of the sub-borrowers stated that they started using deposit facilities
         of their bank after having received the loan.
       • The average term of the larger sub-loans (above US$50,000) was 4-5 years, of
         the smaller RDF II sub-loans 2-3 years, and of the MLF sub-loans 1 year.




                                           15
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low

53.     The Government and BIDV have committed to continue managing the revolving
fund in line with the development objective. The TRFP gives the Bank an opportunity to
monitor this. The long term sustainability of the project depends on the profitability of
investments made by the sub-borrowers. Unless economic conditions deteriorate
drastically, there is no reason to expect the positive results so far to be reversed. Both
PFIs and BIDV bear a credit risk, and therefore have incentive to continue to carefully
evaluate the sub-loans. All PFIs have improved their financial position, while BIDV has
become a much stronger financial institution.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

54.     Rating: The Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry was “satisfactory.?
The main elements of project design, its procedures, PFI accreditation criteria, the
lending policies and manuals, and the IDPs were carefully prepared and reviewed by peer
reviewers and management. Lessons derived from the predecessor project (FRFP) were
taken into consideration. The main shortcoming was that no beneficiary surveys had been
built into the original project design.

(b) Quality of Supervision

55.     Rating: The Bank’s supervision, including of fiduciary and safeguard policies,
was “satisfactory? – this is the rating that was given by the Bank’s Quality Assurance
Group (QAG) during its 7th Quality of Supervision Assessment focusing on Development
Effectiveness, Supervision of Fiduciary/Safeguard Aspects, Adequacy of Supervision
Inputs and Processes, and Candor and Quality of ISR. The QAG found some aspects
highly satisfactory, notably the quality of advice and workable solutions offered by the
Bank’s task team, the effective time spent in the field to support implementation of the
recommendations made, and the effectiveness of relationships with the borrower and the
many financial institutions involved. Supervision missions were carried out regularly,
mostly twice per year. Mission composition was adequate, with qualifications responding
to current issues. Missions worked closely with BIDV on all relevant issues and
concerns, and facilitated finding appropriate solutions. Supervision missions traveled to
different regions and provinces and looked closely at PFIs and their clients. There was
close collaboration between the Bank’s rural development and financial sector teams
during supervision.




                                           16
56.     The Bank’s team identified issues of importance at early stages, such as lack of
full implementation of the environmental safeguards policies. Some of the later
achievements related to compliance with environmental safeguards can certainly be
attributed to the initiatives of the supervision missions. All missions assessed the
achievements related to the institutional strengthening component, with a focus on long
term sustainability and achieving development objectives. The Bank’s team consistently
drew the attention of all concerned parties to the lack of full compliance with capital
adequacy norms by BIDV and VBARD. Proposals made by missions to remedy the
constraints observed were appropriate and practical. The Bank’s team also initiated
beneficiary surveys during mid-term review and after the Project closing.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

57.     Rating: Overall, the Bank’s performance is rated “satisfactory,?, for the following
reasons: (i) the appraisal was completed in a reasonable period of time, and was of
satisfactory quality; (ii) the initial design of the project was solid, worked well during
implementation and did not require any major changes; (iii) supervision missions were
scheduled appropriately and contributed to identifying problems and solutions; and
(iv) based on the QAG report, excellent advice and workable solution were provided by
the Bank for each of the problem areas indicated, and the resultant actions were very
effective.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

58.     Rating: The Government’s performance has been “satisfactory? on the whole. It
provided the complementary services and policies that supported rapid growth and
poverty reduction in rural areas. It improved the regulatory and supervisory framework
under which financial institutions operate, such as through new regulations pertaining to
minimum equity capital for private banks. Where it fell short, through interest rate
controls and not providing sufficient equity to BIDV and VBARD, this was due largely
to the world financial crisis. In the former case, this was a decision of the legislature,
while in the latter it was due to the shortage of public funds in 2008 and 2009.


(b) Implementing Agencies’ Performance

59.     Rating: BIDV performance as the apex bank was “satisfactory?. Throughout, it
handled project implementation in a responsible manner, acting promptly on pending
issues, requests and proposals. It adequately endowed the PMU with human resources
and equipment and an independent leadership to be able to handle project management.
Continuity of staff in the PMU was high, and staff had access to sufficient funds for all
implementation-related issues. BIDV also ensured adequate endowment of all units with
qualified staff, and created a separate unit to handle environmental matters, staffed with a
director and two qualified staff, an engineer and an environmental economist. It prepared



                                            17
well for supervision and impact assessment missions. Audits were commissioned on
time, and there were unqualified audit opinions throughout the project period. BIDV
helped ensure solid loan appraisal, monitoring and collection systems among the PFIs.
PMU staff undertook numerous field visits, and acted upon issues in a timely and
appropriate manner. Finally, they did a professional job in their ex-post survey of sub-
borrowers.

60.     The M&E system introduced by BIDV has performed well and captured financial
flows, transactions and results mostly in a comprehensive, timely and accurate manner.
Reports were submitted in good quality and in time.

61.     As beneficiary of institutional strengthening activities, BIDV performance has
also been “highly satisfactory.? It has strengthened its strategic planning and revised its
overall organization structure in accordance with best international practices. There was a
fundamental improvement in BIDV’s corporate governance and risk management
structure, and substantial gains in its financial and operational performance. BIDV also
complied with all the project legal covenants except the one regarding the capital
adequacy ratio (CAR), but this was largely outside of its control.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

62.    Rating: The overall performance of the borrower is rated as “satisfactory? for
reasons explained above.

6. Lessons Learned

63.     When a government is taking a series of measures to improve conditions in rural
areas, and rural term credit is in short supply, easing this constraint can have a major
positive impact on rural incomes. It also leads to increases in access to other financial
services such as use of savings deposits.

64.     Credit projects are likely to succeed when they are relatively straightforward in
structure, provided that the broad financial sector reform issues have been or are being
addressed at the same time.

65.     A local commercial bank, if suitably strengthened, may be in the best position to
serve as an apex lending institution, provided that there is strong commitment from its
senior management including willingness to provide the necessary resources to a PMU
and to set up an effective M&E system.

66.     A strong PMU can be used as a training ground for its larger institution, provided
the institution’s senior management is committed to this rather than isolating the PMU.

67.       Private banks can be attracted to significantly expand term credit in rural areas,
provided they have access to longer-term funds and receive appropriate training and TA.
It is feasible to have vigorous competition among banks, even in poor rural areas.



                                            18
68.    Environmental standards can be introduced even for small sub-borrowers,
provided that emphasis is given to education and not just regulation. This is especially
important in activities like livestock and aquaculture.

69.     It is important to maintain a focus on institutional strengthening, especially in
financial management, of PFIs throughout project implementation, even after their
accreditation to access a credit line. The institutional strengthening component should be
started early in the project, as it takes time for it to reach full speed, lest it lag behind the
credit component.

70.     Job creation, in relation to investment amounts, is much greater for small sub-
projects than for larger ones.

71.     Beneficiary surveys should be built into credit projects, and should preferably be
carried out by or at least with the participation of independent entities.

72.    Within the Bank, close collaboration between the agriculture and finance teams is
important for the success of rural credit projects. On the government side, an inter-
ministerial steering committee can play a similar role in resolving issues.

2.    The component consisted of two sub-components, i.e. the Rural Development
Fund II (RDF II) and the Microfinance Loan Fund (MLF). The outputs from this
component are highly satisfactory exceeding the expectation of the originally set KPIs.

3.      The lending to viable rural economic entities has improved their economy,
increased employment opportunities, and thus indirectly contribute to poverty reduction.
Micro-finance has directly contributed to poverty reduction by financing micro-
enterprises and individual poor people to finance their viable economic activities. The
largest share of the RDF II disbursements took place in the Mekong Delta (39%), a
region with active rural development, while 32% of the MLF was used in the Northern
Mountain area and the Midland region, where the density of the poor is the highest. The
mobile banking vehicles purchased by the project funds also helped bring financial
services to rural and remote areas, which are still underserved.

4.      IDA credit together with the revolving fund leveraged total investments in rural
Vietnam of USD 870 million. Based on the information provided during sub-loan
appraisals by the PFIs, the number of incremental jobs created is 275,000. The field
survey by ADL in 2005 indicated that most term loans have financed production growth
investments that have created considerable incremental income (every dollar invested
generated extra $0.8 revenue) and employment (on average every subproject created 3
new jobs). The survey also showed that the MLF and the mobile banking units have



                                          21
allowed the rural poor to access to finance for their very first time (30% of the end-
borrowers are first-time borrowers) and increase their income. In addition, 30% of end-
borrowers opened a saving account with the PFIs and 60% of those borrowers were first
time savers with the financial institution.

5.     The number of loans of 444,644 made under the project is quite impressive,
representing 254% of the appraisal projections (175,000). Of these, 170,597 loans were
made under the RDF II and 274,047 under the MLF. The average sub-loan amount under
the project is about US$2,000, and the average sub-loan disbursement under the MLF
was below the maximum value for household loans (US$400). These values show the
constant efforts of the PFIs and project management to reach out to lower income groups.
This result is even more encouraging as the majority of the PFIs are private joint-stock
banks, and all banks were under constant pressure to improve their profitability by
lowering their transaction costs through making larger loans.

6.      No sectoral allocations had been imposed on the financial institutions. Out of the
total PFI and MFI disbursements, 30.1% were for services and commerce, 28.9% for
livestock, 18.1% for agricultural cultivation, 6.4% for aquaculture, 4.1% for processing,
2.2% for handicrafts and 9.8% for other purposes, as shown in the table below.

7.     The repayment situation achieved throughout the project implementation was
highly satisfactory. None of the 25 PFIs ever defaulted on a loan from BIDV. Between
PFIs and their sub-borrowers, the average end-of-year past due loans was between 0.1%
and 0.7% in the case of the RDF II loans, and between 0.0% and 0.6% in the case of
MLF loans. None of the PFIs that recorded a peak default in one year ever accounted for


                                           22
a peak a second time. This shows that PFIs improved their credit risk management. The
net past due loans were thus constantly below 2% as required by the appraisal document.
At the end of the project, a proportion of 0.67% of total loans outstanding at that time
was in arrears, as shown in the table below.

Component 2: Institutional Strengthening

Overview
8.       There were only 7 PFIs under the FRFP, while under this project 25 PFIs were
accredited by BIDV, representing 57% of all the commercial banks in the country in
2009. This has created a level playing field for all interested financial institutions.
Accreditation of PFIs and MFIs was made on the basis of the eligibility criteria related to
solvency, liquidity, profitability and quality of management. Where a PFI or MFI did not
meet all the criteria, it could join the project on condition that its IDP (i) showed
compliance in the future and (ii) was accepted by BIDV and the Bank. With the changes
of prudential regulations by the SBV, banks were no longer expected to report on some
criteria, which necessitated some changes. The table below shows the original
accreditation criteria and the revisions in July 2007.

9.       The PFIs benefited from the institutional capacity building component that has
enabled them to (i) carry out training programs in areas where they experienced
significant skills gaps (risk management, appraisal skills); (ii) receive TA to develop
know-how in important banking areas (i.e. risk management) and (iii) implement IDPs
that have helped them improve operational and financial indicators. This has had a
noticeable impact. There were 954 training courses conducted for some 22,000 PFI
management and credit officers on project appraisal, assets and liability management,
risk management, and training of trainers. The TA helped BIDV implement its risk
management strategy among others, and also assisted the PMU to prepare the financial
institution accreditation manual, subproject appraisal manual and user’s requirement
report as input for the project MIS. TA was also used to carry out independent
environment audits.

Implementation of IDPs, and their impact on PFIs
10.     Any PFI that did not fully meet the accreditation criteria was requested to develop
an IDP in which it would state specific steps to improve its financial and operational
performances. The IDPs were carefully reviewed and assessed by BIDV, and monitored
through project implementation. The senior managers of PFIs visited have indicated that
the IDP helped them focus on the specific areas to be improved, and they they were
requested to achieve international standards. As such, all 25 PFIs have significantly
improved their risk and credit management systems, approaches, and range of services.
In some cases, the improved MIS that resulted helped the banks to generate the interest of
potential strategic investors and convince some of them to actually become shareholders.
11.      The financial sector of Vietnam was not immune to the global financial crisis that
started in 2008; comparison of the results for September 2009 with the two previous
years shows that the extent of compliance with the six indicators was lower during the
height of the global financial crisis. However, as the above table indicates, the PFIs were
able to regain strengths gradually due to various factors including the project’s


                                            24
contribution of IDP implementation, TA and training program. While not all PFIs had
their accounts audited before project start, this regulation has been fully complied with
since. PFIs borrowing more than US$1 million from the project credit must produce
audit report based on International Accounting Standard, which is not compulsory under
normal Vietnamese financial regulations.
12.     The output and impact of this component is further shown in the table below by
the achievements of BIDV in meeting the KPIs.         With the changes of prudential
regulations by the SBV, banks were no longer expected to report on some criteria, which
necessitated some minor adjustment of the KPI to make it consistent with the overall
financial sector reporting requirement in Vietnam. This adjustment was discussed and
agreed between the Bank’s mid-term review mission and BIDV in later 2006.

Institutional Strengthening of BIDV
13.     BIDV’s Board of Directors showed strong commitment in preparing and
implementing its IDP, with the support of the Bank. The IDP aims to achieve
international standards. Together with the project TA and continuous advice from the
Bank’s task team, it has helped BIDV become a much stronger bank. BIDV’s credit
growth has been kept at a reasonable level (about 22% in recent 3 years) while the
prudential ratios, credit quality and profitability have improved significantly.
14.     In most dimensions, BIDV has shown substantial progress, and it has fully
complied with six out the nine KPIs. In term of credit quality, BIDV has achieved great
progress in reducing its Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio. BIDV is the first bank in
Vietnam's banking system to set up and apply an internal credit rating system and loan
classification under Article 7 of Decision 493 issued by SBV, which is based on
international practice. Together with other effective measures, the ratio of NPL/total


                                           25
outstanding loans of BIDV has decreased rapidly, from 31% in 2005 to 4% in 2007,
which is below the required 5% of the project. This rate continued to decrease, to 2.7% in
September 2009. In addition, the percentage of NPL coverage (provision for loan
loss/NPL) of BIDV reaches 165% in September 2009; this is a significant achievement.
15.     The profitability indicators of BIDV have also been improving. In 2005, BIDV’s
RoE and RoA were still only 3.7% and 0.1% respectively. At the end of 2007, BIDV’s
RoE and RoA reached 25.1% and 0.89% respectively, meeting the project targets. In
2008, serious domestic challenges and the global financial crisis led to their RoE and
RoA dropping to to 19.4% and 0.8%, respectively. In 2009, however, thanks to the
recovery of the economy and to drastic measures relating to growth and credit quality
made by BIDV, its profitability ratios began improving again. According to the latest
data, as of September 2009, BIDV’s net profit had nearly doubled in a year (largely
because of a dramatic decrease in provisioning for bad loans), and its RoE and RoA
increased to 37.0% and 1.85% respectively.
16.     With regard its loans, BIDV has diversified sectorally, and reduced lending to
those sectors with high potential risks such as construction.. In September 2009, the
proportion of private sector lending of BIDV had reached 63.6%, and loans pursuant to
the state plan had dropped from 13% in 2003 to 0.45%, which was much lower than the
commitment made under the project.
17.     In terms of management, BIDV has completed an organizational restructuring
linked to fundamental changes in its overall management and policy making process. In
its effort to develop human resources, BIDV also borrowed nearly $1 million from RDF
II fund to implement the TA recommendations.
18.     Despite still being below the international standard of 8%, the Capital Adequacy
Ratio (CAR) of BIDV improved significantly during the project, from 3.1% in 2002, to
4.4% in 2004, 5.6% in 2006, 6.7% in 2008 and 6.8% in September, 2009. BIDV has
prepared a plan to improve its CAR further, by controlling credit growth and asset quality
and improving operational performance, so as to proactively create additional sources of
supplementing chartered capital. In addition, the Government plans to grant additional
capital for SOCBs including BIDV. Finally, BIDV will also increase its charter capital
through an initial public offering (IPO) based on its capitalization plan which would help
BIDV to fully meet its SRFP commitment for its CAR by next year.
19.    The second set of only partially met KPIs is linked to deposit mobilization.
Against the target set on the proportion of private deposits in total deposits, the BIDV
missed the target by almost 16 percentage points, and by almost 13 percentage points as
regards the proportion of longer term deposits in total deposits. During a period of crisis
when depositors massively withdrew their deposits from the banking sector, and shifted
term deposits back into more liquid and freely accessible investments, the importance of
the two indicators may have to be interpreted in a slightly different light.

Institutional Strengthening of VBARD
20.      VBARD is the only commercial bank in Vietnam with branches in every rural
district and commune. It has made enormous progress in a number of dimensions with
the support of the IDP prepared under this project. VBARD has completed restructuring
of its branch network and implemented successfully phase 2 of its Bank Modernization
and Payment System Project supported by the World Bank’s financial sector team. It has
borrowed TA credit under this project to review and improve its strategic planning,
corporative governance, organization restructuring and human resources development.
VBARD’s has agreed to borrow US$ 7 million under the TRFP for TA and training to
improve its overall risk management and its branch network efficiency. Its assets and
loans have grown rapidly over the past three years. Assets increased from US$15 billion
in 2006 to US$25 billion in 2009, and outstanding loans from US$12 billion in 2006 to
US$20 billion in 2009, making it the biggest commercial bank in the country.
21.     Given the prominence of VBARD under the FRFP and its overall importance for
rural development in the country, three KPIs were established to monitor its performance
under the SRFP: for adequacy of equity, credit quality and profitability. All three
improved significantly during the project, although two met the agreed standards.
22.     Like BIDV, VBARD was unable to meet the international standards on capital
adequacy. By the end of the project, its CAR was just 4.5%, well below the required 8%.
VBARD’s CAR had been improving, and reached 6.7% in 2007 due to some capital
injections by the state, retained earnings and long term bonds recognized as tier-2 equity.
However, with the rapid growth of risk assets during a period of rapid expansion of
lending, capital adequacy could not keep pace and declined towards the end of the
project. VBARD submitted a request for a capital increase, during 2009-2011, consisting
of VND 2.2 trillion of retained earnings and VND 11.4 trillion of and fresh capital
injections. These would bring its equity up to VND 33.0 trillion, or USD 1.8 billion.
Government has already agreed to inject some new equity into VBARD.


                                             27
23.     Non-performing loans (NPL) as a share of its portfolio decreased from 22.4% in
2006 to 3.4% in 2009. VBARD has started to apply an Internal Credit Rating System and
loan classification under Article 7 of Decision 493 that makes credit quality assessment
closed to international practice.
24.     Profitability has also improved, in particular since 2006, when VBARD’s RoE
and RoA were only 6.3% and 0.4%, respectively. By the end of the project, these ratios
had gone up to 18.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Much of the profitability derived from
improved credit management, appraisal and recovery of past due loans, increased
efficiency derived from the restructuring of the branch network, and a new MIS
introduced along with new IT software.
25.     Other PFIs KPI. The proportion of deposits with a maturity over one year in
total deposits mobilized by PFIs/MFIs was to exceed 35%. At project completion date,
the rate was 30%. While this represents a shortfall, it was still double the consolidated
baseline value of 15%. In addition, as a result of the global financial crisis and the high
inflation rates, the banking sector has suffered from a massive withdrawal of funds by
clients who preferred short-term over longer-term deposits. Households and enterprises
also used their own resources to invest due to Government’s policy of tightening credit
growth to address inflation concerns. Without the global economic crisis, the results
would almost certainly have been better, and could therefore be rated as satisfactory
under the circumstances. The second KPI for other PFIs was the proportion of PFI loans
to non-SOE clients over total loans outstanding. At project completion, this value was
95.7%, against a target of 85%, which is more than ten percent points above the target
value. This can be rated as highly satisfactory.

26.     Total assets of all 26 FIs have grown as well, following similar patterns as the
equity funds. The two SOCBs recorded an increase of 240%, the 23 joint-stock banks of
1,426%. With this asset growth rates, the private commercial banks closed the gap to the
SOCBs; whereas in 2003, an average SOCBs was more than 30 times bigger than a
private joint stock bank, the ratio six years later was down to eight to one.

27.     The level of absolute profits (before taxation) had been a concern for the SRFP
design. But the growth patterns related to profits have been similar to the trends shown
above for the joint-stock banks, where profits increased by 1,252%. However, profit
levels have increased faster in the group of the two SOCBs, by 1,329%. This shows that
the main driver for their equity increases came from profits, not equity injections.

28.    As a result of these profits, the annual RoA has grown in the case of SOCBs, from
0.2% in 2003 to 1.0% at project completion. In the case of the private banks, the rates
have not changed much, but fluctuated around 1.5% ± 0.3% points per year.

29.      The patterns related to the evolution of the RoE differ somewhat, mainly because
of the relative low levels of capitalization of the SOCBs. With the increasing absolute
profits, the return on equity funds increased dramatically in the case of the SOCBs, from
5% in 2003 to almost 22% at project completion. In the case of the joint stock banks, the
ratio fell from about 22% to 15% over the same time, but this is mainly attributable to the
rapid recapitalization exercise that was prompted by the new SBV regulations.

Mobile banking units
30.     Per the requests of the BIDV and VBARD, the Project financed mobile banking
units for these two banks to improve their outreach to rural areas, in particular where
there were no branches or structures from where the banks could serve clients. In total,
243 vehicles were procured, of which 172 were for VBARD and 71 for BIDV. This was


                                                    29
based on the positive experience of VBARD under the FRFP project, during which it had
acquired 159 units. Mobile units are staffed with four persons, i.e. a credit officer, an
accounting officer, a cashier and a driver doubling as guard. Mobile units are used for a
range of tasks, including the transport of credit officers to remote places, collection of
deposits, disbursement of loans, collection of repayments and transfer of physical cash
between remote branches and between provincial main branches and remote branches.
All trips to a village follow a fixed calendar, which is communicated in advance. Based
on the successful experience of mobile banking, VBARD has with its own resources
purchased another 700 units.

31.     Based on a survey done in 2005, VBARD calculated that 630,000 people had
been received by the mobile units. On average, each unit disbursed 2,015 loans, collected
deposits involving 2,111 accounts and conducted 75 cash transportations on a monthly
basis. ADL’s sample survey in 2005 of some units indicated monthly averages of 1,915
deposits worth VND 19.1 billion, 1,980 loan disbursements worth VND 15.4 billion and
1,395 loan collections worth VND 11.0 billion.

                       Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.     As this was a financial intermediary credit project, no ex-ante estimate was made,
at appraisal, of the entire project’s likely Economic Rate of Return (ERR), Net Present
Value (NPV) or Financial Rate of Return (FRR). This is because the onlending was
demand based and it was not clear, at that time, what types of demand-led investments
would be made and how successful they would be. Instead a minimum threshold ex-ante
FRR was set screening for certain loan categories.

2.      The project design called for the division of sub-loans into 3 categories by size,
with each category being treated differently for the purpose of financial and economic
evaluation. Sub-loans over $200,000 were expected to have an ex-ante ERR of 15 %
prior to approval. Sub-loans greater than $50,000 were to have an estimated FRR greater
than 15%. For sub-loans below $50,000, no FRR (or ERR) needed to be estimated ex
ante. Ex-post calculations of FRRs were made on a sample basis, with the sample
weighted more towards the larger sub-loans.


3.      There were no sub-loans greater than $200,000. There were 20 sub-loans larger
than $100,000 completed by project closing. The weighted average (weighted by loan
size) ex-ante FRR was 24.8%, and the ex-post FRR 22.4%, with all of the projects having
an ex-post FRR of at least 15%. The range of return is shown in the table below.

4.     In its ex-post survey, BIDV also found weighted average FRRs of 21% for both
25 sub-projects with sub-loans of at least US$50,000, and for 94 sub-projects with sub-
loans of less than US$50,000 (averaging around US$10,000). Of these sub-projects, only
11 (1 above US$50,000 and 10 below that) had FRRs of below 15%. For a sample of 82
MLF sub-projects, the weighted average FRR was 63%, with the median FRR around
33% (the large difference being due to some sub-projects with very high FRRs).

5.      Indirect evidence of the sub-projects’ financial success is the repayment rate on
loans. The excellent repayment rate throughout the project, as shown in Annex 2, is a
clear indicator that the underlying business activities have been profitable. The year end
average proportions of past due loans have remained below 1% for both RDF II and the
MLF, and have even not significantly increased as a result of the global financial crisis..

6.     Another way to measure economic benefits is via increases in income. ADL’s
impact assessment in 2005, on the basis of a sample of 500 household interviews in
several provinces, had the following results. Their sample of projects cost on average
US$9,745, with 56% of this funded from SRFP resources. The average monthly income
per sub-borrower increased, as a result of the investment funded under the project, from
US$650 to US$1,040, an increase of US$390/month or per year US$4,680/year. This
would imply a net profit of 48% per year on the investment costs. Even assuming that the
actual benefits were 25% less, which would not be unreasonable for such project-
commissioned surveys, the profit margin after servicing the loan would still be an
impressive 36%.

7.      Another important indicator for the project was the number of new jobs created.
Job creation was projected at the time of loan appraisal, based on the business plans of
the sub-borrowers. The ex-ante calculations showed an average of 1.6 jobs to be created
per RDF II sub-loan, or an average sub-project cost of $2,500 per job created. (No similar
calculations were done for MLF.) The results of BIDV’s ex-post sample survey were not
quite as good for RDF II, but still very satisfactory: for sub-loans above US$50,000, the
average investment per job created was US$15,000; for smaller RDF II projects, the
average was US$4,100, and for MLF projects, it was a mere US$520. Some two-thirds


                                            32
of the MLF job creation was outside of the family; one can, however, question whether
the respondents were really referring to full-time, permanent jobs. Adjusting for sub-loan
size, BIDV’s ex-post results imply total job creation, including from roll-over loans, of
some 150-250,000 jobs from RDF II projects, and a comparable number from the much
smaller MLF. In any case, job creation was far above the 50,000 estimated in the PAD.

Impact on PFI profits and government tax revenues

8.       It is not possible to calculate the exact impact of the SRFP on incremental PFI
profits and tax revenues collected by the Government, without expensive and
complicated transaction cost studies, which were outside the mandate of the project. A
rough assessment may however shed some light at the contribution of PFIs to tax
revenues. For the period January 2007 to September 2009, monitoring data on both the
net PFI profits realized and the amount of business tax payments by all PFIs are
available. For the same time period, the average loan portfolios of these banks are
available, and all values have been measured at the end of each quarter. Over this period,
the total net profits of the PFIs were 1.43% of the average loans outstanding. As the
return on lending is often slightly below the average returns from other fee-based banking
activities, this rate would have to be adjusted somewhat downward. On the other hand,
this period probably had lower returns on lending than earlier years; as a result of the
global financial crisis, many clients withdrew deposits, which drove up the demand for
liquidity in the banking sector and the interest rates paid on deposits and inter-bank
lending. Balancing these two factors, a return on lending of 1.07%, which represents
three quarters of the above rate, seems like a good estimate. On the basis of this, and total
sub-lending (including roll-overs) from RDF II and the MLF of US$468 million, the
incremental profits realized by the PFIs directly attributable to the SRFP would be US$5
million for the 33 months covered or USD 11 million for the entire project period.

9.      Using the same approach as above, the tax payments made by the PFIs accounted
for 0.34% of loans outstanding. Using the same discount rate of 25%, the incremental tax
revenue by the Government over the 33 months for which data are available would be
US$1.2 million, equivalent to some US$ 2.6 million for the entire six year period.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

BIDV Beneficiary Survey – done April, 2010

1. Objectives and Implementation Method

The criteria for the sample selection (allocated by sub-loan size, province, business sector
and PFI) were agreed with the World Bank before starting. The survey was carried out
by the PMU. The 212 sub-projects (26 above US$50,000, 104 smaller RDF II, 82 MLF)
were chosen randomly among those completed during 2008 and 2009. There were 3
different questionnaires: crop cultivation; livestock and aquaculture; and services,
processing and small crafts.

Six provinces representing 3 economic regions were selected – Quang Ninh and Bac
Ninh for the Northern Highlands and Mountains region, Ha Tay and Hai Duong for the
Red River Delta, and Kien Giang and An Giang for the Meking River Delta. The
projects were divided fairly evenly among them.

Eight PFIs/MFIs were selected: VBARD, VIB, MHB, Techcombank, Habubank, Kien
Long Bank, Mekong Development (formerly My Xuyen) Bank and MB.

The survey team consisted of 18 managers and experienced officers of the PMU, who
were all given special training as well as up-to-date information on the sub-projects. The
questionnaire was pre-tested in Habubank, Bac Ninh branch. The PFIs were kept fully
informed and were supportive, especially in arranging meetings with clients.

2. General Interview Results

VBARD accounted for 42% of the loans and women borrowers for 41% (both slightly
higher than in the entire sub-project population). Loans for cultivation accounted for
13%, livestock and aquaculture 43%, and services etc. 44%. Some 82% of the loans
were to households. Of the 37 loans to enterprises, almost 2/3 were over US$50,000.

For 39% of the interviewees, this was the first time they had borrowed from a bank.

For the large loans (above US$50,000), the average term was 51 months and the average
amount US$97,000. For the smaller RDF II loans, the average term was 27 months and
the average amount US$10,000. For the MLF, the term averaged 12 months and the
amount US$580.

Almost 90% of the loans were for the main economic activity of the borrower. About 1/3
were to start new businesses, the rest for expansion.

Some 84% of the clients were required to sign an agreement for environmental
protection, and to carry out specific such measures. The other 16% were small borrowers




                                            36
in activities exempt from the need for such measures. Of those required to take
environmental steps, 90% found the requirement easy to carry out.

Almost all borrowers were satisfied with the loan procedures, which took only 7-10 days
generally from application to disbursement.

3. Project Impact Assessment

Some 80% of clients said they achieved their business targets. About 75% of the
interviewees said they would not have had lower investments without the loan.
A full 98.5% of the clients reported higher incomes due to the loans. The average
increase was 65%, from US$1,100/month to US$1,800/month.

The investments created more jobs or family working time for 91% of the clients. The
larger loans were less cost-effective in this – for large loans, US$15,000 created one job;
smaller RDF II loans needed US$4,100, and for MLF loans only US$520.

The following table compares large, smaller RDF II, and MLF loans:

                      Annex 7. Summary of Borrower’s ICR

I.   Assessment of Project Participating Parties

Project Design and Implementing Agency

1.       The decision of selecting Wholesale banking operation model for the Second
Rural Finance Project has proved a good choice. That model helps promote experience
gained and lessons learnt as well as achievements obtained under the First Rural Finance
Project. As for management aspect, wholesale banking operation helps distinguish clearly
between fund management unit (the wholesale bank) and fund utilization units (retail
banks) facilitating the enforcement of management and supervision and ensure safe fund
utilization.

2.     The decision made by the Government and the Bank to place the Project at BIDV
- a commercial bank, and assigned the BIDV to carry out the role of wholesale bank has
been proved as an appropriate choice. BIDV is one of the national leading commercial
banks with more than 50 years in operation, wide-spreading networks, its being audited
under international standard for years, transparent and unsparing in providing
information. BIDV’s Senior Management has strongly committed to the project
implementation to ensure the project to achieve its development objectives. BIDV has
gained experiences in project management and implementation. BIDV has been
successful in setting up and maintaining an independent Project Management Unit
(PMU) with professional staff possessing high level of international project management
and creating a good relationship with partners and being well organized and equipped to
complete tasks entrusted. The decision to select BIDV as a wholesale bank has also
ensured the Project to operate on commercial basis. This was totally in compliance with
the Bank’s requirement which had not been achieved under the First RFP.

The World Bank’s Performance

3.      The project has received positive and efficient assistance from the Bank and
Bank’s staff during its preparation and implementation. WB supervision missions,
conducted at least twice per year, helped discover outstanding issues and deliver
recommendations to resolve shortcomings (Project financing, medium and long terms
loans ratio, environment issues, etc.) and to ensure the achievement of project’s
development objectives. Even though there have been changes in the position of Task
Team Leader (TTL) during early stage of project implementation, newly-appointed TTL
has kept the continuation and consistency in the task management to assist the PMU to
complete its jobs. Borrower's proposal on adjusting Credit Agreement, Project Manual,
Project operation ratios or enquiries on clarifications and no-objections concerning the
project activities have reasonably been reviewed and timely been provided by the TTL.
The TTL has consistently emphasized the importance of achieving the Project
development objectives of ensuring sustainability with all stakeholders through the
project implementation by having high-level discussions with central bank of Vietnam,
the senior management of BIDV and all the PFIs, and by having working-level


                                          39
consultation with PMU and PFI credit officers. According to the senior management of
wholesale bank BIDV: “ The World Bank financing is not significant which takes only
about 1,5% of our total outstanding loan, but its valuable advices and continuous support
during the past several years have opened the door for us and helped us achieve
international standard and become a sustainable commercial bank. The implication goes
much beyond the Project itself?.

4.     The Bank's environmental protection requirement under RFPII has made an
advance in combination of the credit activities and the environmental protection in
Vietnam. WB's requirements as well as its attention and regular supervision missions on
environment have helped upgrading credit officers and local people's awareness of
environment protection in lending activities as well as implementing production and
business activities that has been still a quite new concept at rural areas. Application of
Bank’s Guidelines on procurement has contributed to increasing the transparency in
bidding activities and raised the competitiveness among the goods suppliers and services
providers that help economize the cost for the Borrower.

5.     However, some of the Bank's initial requirements did not seem appropriate with
Vietnam’s conditions such as accreditation criterion of ROA that initially set at 3% was
considered too high for banks in a developing country like Vietnam.

The Government’s Performance

6.       During project implementation, the Government has enforced numbers of policies
aiming at developing a system of credit organization in the direction of modern, safe,
effective and sustainable operation. Legal environment for banking operation has been
continued to be improved in compliance with international practices. SBV has
promulgated Decision 457/2005/QD-NHNN dated on 19th April/2005 regulated on ratios
for ensuring safety of credit institution's operation; Decision 493/2005/QD-NHNN dated
on 22nd April, 2005 regulated on loan classification and provision draw advancing a
further step toward the best international practices on banking operation thereby
facilitating a more precise assessment of credit institutions' real status. Newly
promulgated and undertaken policies have contributed to the improvement of
transparency of financial information and played as a basis for credit institutions plan
their institutional development plan.

7.     The Government has decided to equitize state own commercial banks to improve
more thoroughly the operation capability of those banks. In 2007 and 2008, there were 2
banks of Vietcombank and Vietinbank equitized. According to the Government's plan,
BIDV would be equitized in 2010.

The BIDV and PMU’s Performance

8.     BIDV has achieved institutional strengthening targets committed with WB at its
entrustment of Project management and implementation. Having recognized its role of an
Apex bank with the Government and WB, BIDV has focused on enhancing project fund



                                           40
utilization effect and safe management through plans of supervising and monitoring fund
utilization and management at fund utilization unit, thereby wholesale effectively project
fund.

9.     Regarding project management and implementation: The transfer of some officers
from International Credit Projects Management Unit (ICPMU) under SBV- the FRFP
implementation agency to BIDV was considered as an important decision to ensure the
continuation and consistency during the project preparation and implementation in the
next period. The PMU/BIDV has promoted and applied effectively the experience gained
and lessons learnt from the FRFP in the performance of the SRFP, and helped the project
run smoothly as well as achieve development goals.

10.      The Apex Bank’s (BIDV) efforts and the participation of the PMU since the
designing period of the project have helped reduce the preparation process and accelerate
the operation period, including: (i) early carried out the dissemination of project concepts
to potential PFIs to study their credit demands and encourage them to participate in the
project; (ii) prepared and issued project guidelines and legal framework including Policy
Manuals, Financial Management and Disbursement Manual, and the signing of On-
lending Agreement with the MOF have been conducted synchronously and early, before
the effectiveness of the project; (iii) carried out training courses for officers of wholesale
banks as well as other PFIs who directly involve in the project before disbursement so
that they are fully aware of project details, terms and conditions of Policy Manuals and
regulations on credit fund management and utilization; and (iv) selected and entered into
subsidiary loan agreements with eligible banks, delivered instruction to open account for
management and disbursement of the project fund. Such activities have ensured the fast
and safe disbursement of the project fund.

11.     The project achievements are due to the dedication and great efforts made by
management and staff of BIDV and PMU during the project implementation, especially
in following aspects: (i) building a thorough re-appraisal process with highly
standardized samples and requirements; (ii) through the accreditation and supervision of
PFIs’ quarterly IDPs implementation, the PMU has conducted in depth analysis on PFIs'
financial performance under quantitative and qualitative standards including managerial
skills and the management of bookkeeping account; and (iii) building and making efforts
in performing supervision field trips at least once per month to monitor the eligibility of
sub-projects financed and check the accuracy of key performance indicators reported by
PFIs; (iv) Studying to improve the project management and applying measures to
strengthen risk management in wholesale banking operations; and (v) carrying out
measures to supervise and assess the project performance, discover remaining issues and
set out actions to resolve timely.

12.    Regarding environmental issues: BIDV/the PMU has prepared and issued
Guidelines on Environmental Impact Assessment to resolve environmental issues that
may arise when conducting the disbursement of the project fund. Due to the large amount
of funded sub-projects, of which some are large scaled, the environmental impact




                                             41
assessment (EIA) of sub-projects should be enhanced. Experience gained and lessons
learnt should be taken into consideration in the implementation of the RFPIII.

13.    The organizational stability and due supplementing of officers and equipment for
the PMU to meet the demand of the project activities are one of vital factors to ensure the
success in the project implementation.

II. Socio-economic Impacts

14.     The Second Rural Finance Project has successfully implemented the target of
providing credit for expansion of rural investments. As of 30/09/2009, the Credit
Component under the Project has created an investment portfolio of US$ 870 million
(VND 13,785 billion) in rural areas three times higher than initial estimation (US$ 287
million). Each Project dollar would create US$ 3.9 of investment at rural areas, which is
an increase as compared to initial estimation at appraisal of US$ 1.5.

15. By RDF II and MLF, the Project financed 444,644 feasible business plans by
individuals, rural households and enterprises in 60 out of 64 provinces nationwide. With
the proportion of 99.2% of medium and long term lending, the project has succeeded in
providing medium and long terms financing, which is still scarce in Vietnam’s banking
system, 64% of which is for financing new investment projects or expansion of
production. Female borrowers accounted for 37% of total number of the Project
borrowers. Sub-projects funded have positive impacts on diversification, intensive
development of non-farm activities and contributes to jobs creation and improvement of
the living standards in rural areas. According to statistic data, there were 274,896
incremental jobs created by the Project in rural areas. Each sub-project (VND 64 million
or US$ 4,050 equivalent) created 1.6 jobs in average. This number reveals that the project
funds have been invested in a market segment that has high rate of job creation. Besides,
very high rate of debt collection from end-borrowers by PFIs (above 99%) demonstrates
the efficiency and improvement of incomes by rural investment projects.

16.     The project has achieved the target of enhancing competiveness among banks in
providing financial services to rural areas. The number of financial institutions
participating in disbursement of SRFP funds has increased to 25 compared with 7 in
FRFP. The dependence on VBARD in disbursement of the project funds has been
reduced significantly. In particular, while VBARD accounted for 73% of total
outstanding loans in FRFP by the completion date of 31/12/2001, for SRFP by the
completion date of 30/09/2009, this share decreased to 34%.

17.     The project target of enhancing access to financial services by the rural poor has
been achieved in a high satisfactory manner. In FRFP, all small loans under the Fund for
the Rural Poor (FRP) are disbursed through VBARD. In SRFP, there are up to 8 MFIs
participating in MLF disbursement with 274,047 small and short term loans granted in
rural areas. 38% of the borrowers are female. Due to small scale, about VND 5.5 million
or US$ 350 in average, the targeted borrowers under MLF are the rural poor. One third of
MLF sub-loans have been made in Midland and Northern Mountainous Region, where



                                            42
the density of poor population is the highest among regions in the country. 243 mobile
banking vehicles purchased by the project funds also contributed to bring financial
services to rural and remote areas, where are still underserved.

18.      Regulations on environmental protection in Project lending policy were complied.
Field trips results and 2 courses of environmental audit by independent consultants
showed that there were no big environment issue arose under the Project. In RFP II, this
is the first time commercial banks in Vietnam have combined environment protection
regulation to lending conditions. This practice has contributed to enhance rural
individuals and entrepreneurs’ awareness on environment protection while undertake their
business operation that has not been popular practice in rural areas until recently. RFP II
did not create any social problems in rural areas since there were no re-settlement
activities and as regulated, no finance to land trading activities.

19.     The survey’s results and the Report on SRFP Impacts Assessment conducted in
2005 by Arthur D Little (a Spanish Consulting Firm) indicated that the project has had
positive impact in term of enhancing access to finance in rural areas. More than 30% of
the sub-borrowers have accessed to formal financial services for the first time; 60%
opened a saving account after being granted the SRFP sub-loan; 77% revealed that they
had not been able to carry out their business plans without loans from the SRFP.


III.   Impact to Project Participating Institutions

20.      As of 30/09/2009, there were 25 financial institutions accredited to participate in
the Project, of which 2 were State Owned Commercial Banks, 23 were Joint Stock
Commercial Banks and a Central People’s Credit Fund. Though the amount borrowed
under the Project was insignificant compared to total fund resource of PFIs, but all
institutions have highly appreciated this fund due to its stable availability, long term
nature and reasonable interest rate. Taking part in the Project, beside having additional
resource to finance investments in rural development, requirement for building up and
implementing IDPs for each stage has helped banks set out specific objectives for each
development stage and grow in line with their strategic and controlled orientation.
Regulations on international audit applied for PFIs receiving credit lines of more than
US$ 1 million helped participating banks pursue the best international practices.
Technical assistance and training contracts financed by the Project have assisted BIDV
and PFIs in implementing development strategy, renovating organization structure and
developing human resources that contributed to transformation and formation of
organizational structure and operation toward the best international standards and
common practices on modern banking. Impact from requirement of implementation of
targets under Institutional Development Plans has helped banks considerably improve
their financial performance and corporate governance.

21.    Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV) - As an Apex
Bank, BIDV’s Board of Management has highly appreciated the impacts that the Project
brought to development of the BIDV system. The pursuing of targets set out in its



                                            43
Institutional Development Plan in accordance with the international standards and
practices together with technical assistance under the Project has helped BIDV achieve
great progress in improving financial capacity and in the innovation of management, and
helped BIDV achieve main KPIs agreed with the Bank, specifically:

In terms of Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR): Although the benchmark of 8% has not yet
achieved at the project completion of September 2009, BIDV has made remarkable
progress on improvement of CAR since the beginning of the Project. In accordance with
IFRS, BIDV’ CAR only achieved 3.1% at the end of 2002 - the year of project receipt,
increased to 5.5% at the end of 2006 and attained 6.76% in September 2009. BIDV’s
Board of management has built plan to improve CAR, where it continues to strictly
control credit growth, asset quality and to enhance operation efficiency to actively create
supplement source of equity. In accordance with the plan for strengthening SOCBs’
financial capacity, on February 12, 2010, the Government, by official letter No. 268/QD-
TTg, decided to supplement the BIDV’s chartered capital with additional VND 5,335.5
billion, as such the CAR of BIDV has been improved and reached 9.11% (VAS). The
plan to equitize BIDV in 2010 will also assist the bank to further strengthen its capital
base.

With regard to credit quality: BIDV has made significant progress in reducing NPLs.
BIDV is the first bank in commercial bank system of Vietnam which has built and
applied the internal credit rating system and loan classification under Article 7 of
Decision 493 issued by SBV which is in accordance with international practice. Together
with drastic and effective measures, the ratio of NPLs/total outstanding loan of BIDV has
decreased rapidly over the years from the 9.59% in 2006 to 2.66% in September 2009 or
lower than the benchmark of 5% of the project. In addition, the percentage of NPLs
coverage (Provision for loan loss/NPLs) of BIDV is at very safe level which reaches
165.1% in September 2009. This is a significant achievement of BIDV.

With respect to profitability: The profitability indicators of BIDV have also been
improved very positively. In 2005, BIDV’s indicator of ROE and ROA under IFRS were
still at low level of 3.7% and 0.1% respectively. At the end of 2007, BIDV’s indicator of
ROE and ROA reached to 25.1% and 0.89% respectively or already attained the
committed level to the Bank. Although there was a slight decrease in 2008 due to
domestic difficulty, in 2009, together with the recovery of the economy and results from
drastic measures relating to credit growth and quality made by BIDV’s Board of
Management, its profitability ratios kept being improved. At closing date of September
2009, BIDV’s net profit increased nearly twice compared to that in 2008, ROE and ROA
increased to 36,97% and 1,85% respectively.

Regarding the credit structure, BIDV has continued to undertake strategy of
diversification lending to sectors and reducing loans to highly potential risk sectors. In
September, 2009, BIDV’s lending ratio to non-state-own areas increased to 63.6%, state-
planned loans drastically declined over the years, from 13% in 2003 to 0.45% at the
moment which is much lower than committed level.

In terms of corporate governance, Since September 2008, BIDV has completed the
restructuring and conversion operational organization under the recommendations of the
TA2 project, managed by WB. New organizational model has created the fundamental
changes in management and operation and policy planning of BIDV. In its efforts to
develop human resources, BIDV also used nearly $1 million from RDF II fund to
organize training and re-training for staff to meet demand before and after transferring to
TA2 organization model

22.      Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD) - The key
retail institution in RFPII. Committed ratios required by WB on operation safety, credit
quality and profitability have been significantly improved by the bank.

In terms of Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR): VBARD’s CAR has been improved and
reached 6.70% in 2007. Negative effect of difficulties in 2008 has prevented VBARD

 At Decision No. 268/Q -TTg dated 12/02/2010, the Government decided to supply
chartered capital for some SOCB, among which BIDV and VBARD was supplied with
amount of VND 5,335 billion and VND 10,202 billion respectively.




                                             45
from continuing to achieve progress on CAR. As results, this ratio declined to 4.52% on
30th September, 2009. However, VBARD has a plan to increase its equity from its profit
and reserved funds of about VND 2,000 billion and VBARD will issue long term bonds
amounted to VND 3,000 billion in 2010. Besides, the Government, by decision No.
268/QD-TTg dated February 12, 2010 has also increased chartered capital to VBARD
VND by 10,202 billion. At the end of February 2010, VBARD’s CAR increased to
7.34% that is close to 8% as regulated by the SBV.

With regard to the credit quality, VBARD has remarkably reduced NPLs ratio, especially
since 2006 up to now. NPLs ratio of VBARD has decreased sharply over the years, from
22.43 % in 2006 to 3.36% as of September, 2009. VBARD has started to apply Internal
Credit Rating System and loan classification under Article 7 of Decision 493 that makes
credit quality assessment closed to international practice.

With respect to profitability, which was a weakness of VBARD at the beginning of the
Project but now has been improved considerably. VBARD's ROE in 2008 amounted to
12.89% higher than committed with WB and continued to reach 18.71% at the end of the
Project.

Regarding the corporate governance, from 2008, VBARD has completed restructuring
branches network and implemented successfully the phase 2 of Bank Modernization and
Payment System Project. It also has completed consultant contract with Rabo
International Advisory Service (Holland) and started to implement consultants'
recommendations on strategic planning, organization re-structuring and human resource
developing. VBARD's Board of management also has committed to borrow US$ 7
million under RFPIII to implement overall technical assistant program to strengthen its
operation and financial capacity.

23.      Other PFIs: Other 24 PFIs have made great progress on implementation of IDP
especially on strengthening capital base, enlarging network, applying modern banking
technology and developing new products. In general, PFIs have been successful in
maintaining healthy financial status with 16 out of 24 PFIs achieved all accreditation
criteria at the end of 2007. Almost all PFIs have maintained CAR over 8%. PFIs' asset
quality has been maintained with average NPLs below 2%. PFIs' profitability was also
improved.

IV. Lessons Learnt

24.  From RFPII success factors, it is possible to draw lessons for implementing other
ODA projects in Vietnam or in other countries with similar conditions:

(a) The model of wholesale banking for credit projects such as RFPs or other projects
    with credit components is an appropriate choice for developing countries like
    Vietnam. This model allows a large number of banks to participate and therefore a
    large amount of funds can be quickly transferred to beneficiaries especially when the
    scope of the project is large and targeted beneficiaries are people in rural and remote
    areas.
(b) The selection of a commercial bank with financial and managerial competence as an
    Apex Bank and high commitments from its Board of Management is a vital factor for
    project success.
(c) Early establishment and maintenance of a PMU with a proper organization and
    professional staffs to be a hub for coordination among Governmental Agencies and
    Donor right from project preparation phase is an essential factor.
(d) Legal documents for guiding project implementation should be established at early
    stage and disseminated to parties participating in Project implementation.
(e) The control and supervision of project fund management and usage are extremely
    important and should be core elements of Apex Bank and PMU’s operations. The
    regular control and supervision at project participating institutions will ensure the
    project funds to be safely managed, used efficiently and for intended purposes.
(f) Active communications with and take advantage of ideas and supports of
    Governmental Agencies and Donors during the project implementation is also a
    decisive factor. For large projects falling in the Government’s priority list like the
    RFPs, it is necessary to establish a Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee to direct and
    supervise the project owner in implementation of the project objectives.
