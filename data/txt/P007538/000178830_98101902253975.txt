A PhDPOSED LDAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.A. WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE
UNITED MEXICAN STATES FOR A FIFTH AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Nacional Financiera, S. A. with the guarantee of the United Mexican
States for the equivalerLt of US$125 million to help finance a fifth
agricultural and livestc'ck development project. The loan would have a term
of 20 years, including four years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent
per annum. The proceeds of the loan would be on-lent on the same terms, plus
a service charge of 1/8 of 1 percentyto Fondo de Garantia y Fomento para la
Agricultura, Ganaderia y Avicultura (FONDO), the executing agency of the
project.
PART I - THE EOONOMY
2.        Some of the major structural features of the Mexican economy -
past, present and future - were analyzed in "The Economy of Mexico: A
Basic Report" (192-ME), distributed to the Executive Directors on June 26,
1973; short-run trends in 1973-74 were covered in "tMexico: Current Economic
Position and Prospects"t, distributed on September 27, 1974. Another updating
mission visited Mexico in July 1975. Its draft findings were discussed
with the authorities at the highest level in Mexico in early December.
Subsequently, the Mexican budget for 1976 has been presented to the Congress.
A further Bank mission visited Mexico in late January to review the govern-
ment's fiscal and monetary program for this year. The findings of this
mission will be incorporated in an economic report to be distributed to
the Executive Directors by March 1976. Country data sheets are contained
in Annex I.
3.        For the three most recent decades, the Mexican economic system,
measured in terms of GD]' growth, has been outstandingly successful. Since
1940, the annual average- growth rate has exceeded 6 percent. And from the
mid-1950s to 1972, Mexico was among the few countries in the developing
world to combine sustained and rapid growth with monetary and balance of
payments stability. Inflation averaged less than 5 percent a year and the
dollar value of the peso was maintained at the level fixed in 1954.
4.        Rapid and sustained growth was the product of successful policies
affecting the mobilization and use of both private and public sector
resources. The role of government in promoting economic growth was expressed
on the one hand in the dlevelopment of strategic infrastructure and major
utility industries and, on the other, in policies which featured price support,
import control and agrarian reform measures in the agricultural sector and
external protection and the provision of fiscal incentives in the industrial
sector.

5.        The relative emphasis of public and private investment was,
however, reflected in changes in the structure of output and employment and
the expansion of manufacturing industry. Agriculture, nevertheless,
continued to be the chief source of employment end in 1970 accounted for
39 percent of the economically active population.
6.        In spite of rapid and sustained economic growth over this long
period, the combination of a high demographic growth rate - about 3.4
percent per year - and, until fairly recently, primarily import substituting
industrial policies, have prevented an adequate absorption of the labor
force in productive employment. Industrial growth has been quite substantial -
about 8 percent annually since the mid-fifties - but could have been even
faster if industrial and trade policies had been primarily focused on
exploiting Mexico's unique export opportunities based on its contiguity
to a large industrial market in which labor costs are much higher than those
in Mexico. It was only in the early seventies that some important steps
were taken to develop manufacturing exports on a large scale - the system
of drawbacks on domestic taxes paid on exports and the "border industries"
regime were introduced at that time, and these have been so highly
successful as to suggest that a lot more could still be done. As it is, 40
percent of the labor force is estimated to be still engaged in marginal
occupations relatively unproductive and hence poorly paid - or to be openly
unemployed.
7.        The Mexican strategy for development hass in the past, relied
on a combination of public action and private profit. The government has
played a highly important role in this process, both in promoting key
industries, such as power and petroleum, and in creating a regulatory and
institutional framework within which private and social groups could
compete and contend, but which was both finm enough and flexible enough to
ensure overall continuity and stability. As a formula for growth, this
system has served Mexico well; it has however also led to a sharpening of
contrasts in income and wealth between people and among regions. This was
not entirely an incidental by-product of the process of growth; the share
of the government in the economy was kept down quite deliberately for many
years, and the scope of redistributive policies was necessarily limited as
long as the tax ratios remained under ten percent - among the lowest in the
world. The government played a crucial role in the development of private
commercial agriculture through irrigation and credit policies and of
industry through the provision of infrastructure, education, social
legislation and financial policies, but it did not concern itself primarily
with the problems of the poorest sections of the population. While the land
reform of 1915 was sustained, the absence of abundant fiscal resources
made it impossible to develop major programs to improve the economic
status of its beneficiaries. The present government, however, came to
power on a program of combining past growth policies with much greater
efforts in favor of the rural poor, and has launched a number of ambitious
initiatives in this direction.



- 3 -
8.        The attempts which have been made by the present administration
(1970-76) to alleviate the poverty of the countryside and to redress some
of the imbalances between rural and urban Mexico have several dimensions.
They include a revised Agrarian Reform Law (1971) and a new Federal Water
Law (1972), both of which are intended to promote a more equitable
distribution of basic agricultural resources. These measures have been
complemented by changes in the sectoral allocation of agricultural credit
in order to increase the share of low-income farmers and ejidatarios
(members of ejidos. which are a form of collective land tenure based on
usufruct), and the introduction of higher support prices for basic
foodcrops. The Government has also increased outlays for agricultural
research, training and extension services, with-particular regard to
the needs of peasant farmers0 Perhaps the most significant innovation
has been a new program for integrated rural devielopment with which the
World Bank has been associated from an early stage0
9.        The social arid economic needs of the rural sector have not
monopolized government attention; those of urban-industrial development
have also been stressed in the form of heavy public investment in basic
industries - delayed dulring the 1960's - and an innovative low-income
housing program which has been financed with a five percent payroll tax.
Productive investment lhas thus been complemented, in the urban as well
as the rural economy, by institutional changes and public expenditures
designed to improve the living conditions of the poor. This parallel
effort has, however, generated several problems of short-run economic
management.
10.       In 1971, after monetary and balance of payments pressures had
emerged during the previous year, the (then new) Government took stringent
action to control demand with the effect that the GDP growth rate fell to
3.7 percent by comparison with a decade average of 7.1 percent in the
1960's. In 1972, renewed expansion was stimulated by public expenditure
and the GDP growth rate rose to 7.4 percent.  There was another year of
rapid growth (7.6 percent) in 1973 - but this time-associated with an
increase of 21 percent in the GDP deflator which was strongly associated
with the impact of exte!rnal inflation. Inflation was not the only novelty;
private domestic financial savings, which in the past had helped finance
sustained growth increased by only 11 percent, compared with an average
annual rate of increasE: of 18 percent in 1965-71; the inflow of private
capital was replaced by a net outflow; and private investment - particularly
in the industrial sector - slackened, reflecting some uncertainty on the
part of the business ccmmunity and a declining interest rate differential
vis-a-vis those prevailing on financial savinga instruments in the United
States. In the public sector, the fiscal deficit amounted to 5.6 percent
of GDP by comparison with an average of 2.7 percent in 1965-71. A major
share of the limited expansion of real credit was used to finance part of
this deficit while net external borrowing of US$1.2 billion (2.1 percent
of GDP) was deployed to finance the rest. These trends were inevitably
reflected in the balance of payments, where the current account deficit
rose to 3 percent of GDP (by comparison with an average of 2.0 percent
in 1965-71).



- 4 -
11.        Noting these trends, the authorities had, by mid-1973, put a
restrictive monetary and credit policy into effect and complemented this
with what was originally intended to be an austere public finance program
for FY74. Taken together, these measures were expected to restrict demand
and to reduce both inflation and the size of the current account deficit.
The results for 1974 indicate that whereas the former objective was
achieved, the latter was not. Monetary and credit policies were, on the
whole, carried out as planned. The rate of increase of prices thus decelerated
from April onwards, and a positive differential between Mexican and foreign
interest rates was reestablished by the end of the year, although credit
was not allocated as originally intended because the public sector again
pre-empted a large part of what was available. Higher than planned public
expenditures and lower than expected revenues meant, moreover, that the
fiscal deficit was larger than foreseen as were the growth rates of aggregate
demand and real imports. The deficit in the balance of payments on current
account thus amounted to 4.2 percent of GDP rather than the intended 2.8 percent.
Net public external borrowing of more than one year rose to US$2.4 billion.
12.        During 1975, the Government's original objective was to achieve
sustained economic growth under what were expected to be adverse conditions
associated with the world recession. The public finance program called for
an increase in public expenditures, which was to be partly financed with a
substantial increase in public revenues based on tax reforms, and it was
expected that the public sector deficit could be reduiced to 4.3 percent of
GDP by comparison with 5.6 percent in 1974. Given this, and assuming only
a moderate growth of imports in real terms, a decline in the resource gap
and in the current account deficit in the balance of payments were anticipated.
With a modest level of public internal borrowing and an expected recovery in
quasi-money deposits the intention was to maintain a restrictive monetary
policy while allowing a modest increase in real private credit and on this
basis to achieve a substantial reduction in inflation.
13.        In the light of provisional results for 1975, it is clear that the
objectives of this program were not fully realized. The real GDP growth rate
is estimated to have been of the order of 4.0 percent, the current account
deficit in the balance of payments is estimated at the equivalent of 4.9
percent of GDP and the public sector deficit was equivalent to 9.1 percent
of GDP. On a more positive note however, quasi-money growth is estimated at
25 percent over the year, and the annual rate of inflation is estimated at
11.2 percent. It is clear that the world recession had a much greater than
expected impact on the economy and was moreover one of the factors that led
to the growth of the public deficit because the Government attempted to counter-
act the slowdown in economic growth with increased public expenditures. The
increase in public sector revenues was somewhat smaller than expected but
nevertheless amounted to an increase of about 1.8 percentage points of GDP,
which represents an important achievement in resource mobilization. The



- 5 -
discrepancy between the original targets of the 1975 economic program and its
estimated outcome will have a constraining influence on economic management
in 1976 and it is expected that the authorities will make a major effort to
control public expenditures and to limit the size of this year's public
deficit. It is also expected that money, credit and balance of payments
policies will be designed to reduce the resource gap. In recent discussions
with Bank staff, the authLorities have stressed their determination to take
whatever action may be necessary to reduce inflation, and to restore financial
and balance of payments equilibrium, even though they recognize that some
of the required measures may have to await the inauguration of a new
administration in December 1976. In support of this claim the public finance
program for 1976 features greater a priori realism than the budgets of the
last two-years. It makes only mode-st assumptions about the growth of revenues
and puts more emphasis on. controlling expenditures. The money and credit
programs for the year ares, in principle, consistent with these objectives.
14.       On December 31, 1974, Mexico's outstanding and disbursed public
debt of more than one year was US$7.5 billionl. Net medium- and long-term
public borrowing in 1974 of US$2.4 billion reflected heavy reliance on external
as well as internal capital to finance the fiscal deficit and some borrowing -
as in 1973 - to offset private capital movements.
15.       During 1975, net public external borrowing of more than one year will
be of the order of US$3.4 billion, which amounted to 4.4 percent of estimated
GDP compared with 2.7 percent in 1974. Both in 1974 and 1975 a very large
proportion of new borrowing has been in the form of credits from banking institu-
tions. Mexico's ability to service a rising level of debt is closely associated
with its export growth performance. The behavior of petroleum exports is an
important element in export performance. After allowing for the growth of
domestic consumption, the rate of growth of crude output and the export surplus
will continue to rise through 1980 by which time net exports of crude and
petroleum products are conservatively projected at US$1,000 million. Mexico's
debt service ratio was 20.5 percent in 1974; the estimate for 1975 is
25.6 percent. The debt service ratio will probably be higher than this
in the remainder of the 1970's and early 80's but can be expected to decline
to about the present leveL by the mid-80's. The actual level of debt service
payments will, of course, depend on the management of the balance of payments.
The Bank's share of the public debt outstanding and disbursed at the end of
1974 was approximately 12.9 percent and its share in debt service payments was
about 8.5 percent. These shares are expected to fall during the remainder of
this decade.
16.       Mexico is creditworthy for borrowing on conventional terms
provided the Government exercises due restraint in monetary, balance of
payments, credit and fiscaI policies and, above all, maintains a favorable
climate for export expansion; its recent statements concerning economic



- 6 -
payments, credit and fiscal policies and, above all, maintain a favorable
climate for export expansion; its recent statements concerning economic
policies for 1976 suggest it intends to do so and it is our intention to
continue to monitor developments in close contact with the authorities.
17.       In order to meet its financing needs to assure continued growth
with equity in the future, Mexico will have to strengthen its fiscal
effort while supplementing that effort with substantial externa; borrowing
on acceptable terms. Given that the country's diversified industrial
structure is capable of supplying a good part of its capital goods require-
ments, some local cost financing by external agencies is necessary. Bank
loans in such sectors as power, transport and industry are traditionally
tied to the foreign exchange cost of projects. Some local currency financing
is justified in other sectors with characteristically low foreign exchange
requirements, especially for high priority and institutionally complex
projects like agricultural development in which there are substantial economic
and social benefits and which call for strong institutional support by the
Bank.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPE'ATIONS IN MlEDCaGO
Bank and IFC Loans
18.       As of December 31, 1975, the Bank has made 41 loans to Mexico
for a total of US$2,197.7 million net of cancellations of which 25 loans,
amounting to Us$1,239.9 million, were fully disbursed. In addition, the
Executive Directors approved two loans of US$4O million for a medium cities
water supply projec-t and of US$50 million for a second industrial equipment
fund (FDNEI) project in December,1975 and January, 1976 respectively.
Disbursements averaged some US$70 million per year during FY66-70 and about
US$123 million per year during FY71-75. Some 35 percent of Bank lending to
Mexico has been for agriculture and rural development (13 loans for
US$781 million), 32 percent for power (11 loans for US$715 million), and
20 percent for transportation projects (11 loans for US$448 million); the
remaining 13 percent of Bank lending have been for industry and water supply.
The execution of Bank financecl projects has, on the whole, been satisfactory.
A number of problems related to the financial management of the power,
railways and port sectors, on which I reported to you in earlier 'resident's
Reports, have now been resolved or are in the process of resolution.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as of December 31, 1975,
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
19.       As of December 31, 1975, IFC has made 13 investment commitments
in Mexico, for a total of US$69.9 million, of which US$36.6 million had
been sold, repaid or cancelled. The balance held by the Corporation,
US$33.3 million, consists of US$27.6 million in loans and US$5.7 million
in equity. A summary statemen-t of IFC investments as of December 31, 1975
is presented in Annex II.



-7-
Bank Lending Strategy
20.       The main objectives of Bank lending in Mexico have been to:
(i) support policies and programs leading to a wider distribution of the
benefits of economic growth; (ii) strengthen policies and programs leading
to continued economic growth and to more effective management of key sectors
of the economy; (iii) help resolve critical adjustment problems that
evolve from Mexico's ccontinued economic growth; and (iv) complement
Mexico's domestic savings in a framework of internal and external financial
stability. In addition, in the light of Mexico's short- and medium-term
prospects, we intend, chiring this and the next fiscal years, to pay special
attention to projects that wouldi (i) make relatively limited demands on
the Government's budget; (ii) help generate public enterprise revenues and
savings; (iii) have relatively short gestation periods and strong productive
impact; and (iv) have Etrong balance of payments implications, either in
the form of additional exports or efficient import substitutions, where
Bank participation can play a catalytic fu-nction.
21.       Over the last few years, Bank lending to Mexico has evolved to
the goals outlined above, as is evident from its sectoral mix and policy
emphasis. Thus, a Bank loan of US$70 million for the Las Truchas steel mill
(FY74) attempts to further,the country's industrial growth as well as to
support the Government's policy of industrial decentralization. Likewise,
a fertilizer project, for which the Bank made a loan of US$50 million (FY75),
is expected to help promote new poles of development in the resource-rich
southeast region and the north central area and to make Mexico independent of
imported urea fertilizer in the medium term. Further projects with similar
aims are being prepared and will be presented in due course.
22.       As regards infrastructure, the Bank has focused on investments
in key areas of the country as well as on institutional reforms and sector
policies aiming, inter alia, at suitable pricing mechanisms to help generate
additional resources for investment financing. While the airport development
project (FY74) of US$25 million has been designed in support of the
Government's policy of regional integration, the Mexico City water supply
project (FY73) of US$90 million has been instrumental in the establishment
of a specialized institution for efficient management of water resources in
the Mexico Valley, and in the pricing of water at levels more closely related
to costs. Likewise, the recently approved Medium Cities Water Supply
Project of US$40 milliona seeks to mobilize additional resources for financing
the large investment re,quired to meet the increasing demand in that sector,
especially among low income groups whose standards of health are thus
expected to improve. DI addition, new institutional arrangements have been
made to allow a more systematic and economic approach to investment
planning for water supply. We are planning to present projects with a similar
institutional focus in the railways, ports, roads and the power sector for
your consideration in the near future.



- 8 -
23.       In view of the difficult structural problems of Mexico's
agriculture and the sector's crucial importance to the country's further
development, the Bank has made agriculture the leading sector for its
lending. Consistent with the overall framework of country and sector
objectives, a three-tier approach is being followed. First, Bank
support is aimed at expanding and strengthening irrigation and agricultural
credit programs so as to meet the demands of a rapidly growing population
more adequately and to generate the foreign exchange needed for rising
import requirements. Second, to assist the government in its efforts
to raise the incomes of the rural poor and improve their standards of
living through a combination of directly productive, productive support
and social infrastructure investment. Third, to strengthen Mexico's
institutional capability to use scarce agricultural resources more
efficiently.
24.       The Rio Bravo/Rio  San Juan Irrigation rehabilitation project
(FY75) of US$150 million will thus significantly increase agricultural
and livestock production on more than a quarter of a million hectares and
benefit more than 100,000 people. The Papaloapan and PIDER integrated rural
development projects (FY75) of US$50 and US$110 million, respectively, have
their primary focus on improving the living standards and productivity of
close to 1.5 million people through integrated, multisectoral development.
Another rural development and two irrigation projects are now being prepared
for possible Bank financing.  In addition, we are exploring the possibilities
for a lagoon fisheries project and for tropical agricultural development
and research in the Gulf coast; both of these projects are on the frontiers
of our involvement in agriculture which would lead to community development
in addition to laying the foundation for large-scale exploitation of
Mexico's tropical agriculture in the future.
25.       The present project is an essential element in the government's
attempt to reconcile growth and social equity in its development policies.
The project would complement and make more effective the various other
measures the government has already taken in agricultural development by
improving credit services throughout the country with a special component
for small producers at concessional rates.
PART III - THE AGRICUITURAL SECTOR
Production and Trade
26.       Agriculture has long been a critical element of Mexico's economic
development. The sector's growth record of more than 5 percent per annum
over nearly three decades (1940-1965) is unique among Latin American



-9-
countries. In that period, it managed to satisfy the demand of a rapidly
growing population and to transform the country from a net importer to a
net exporter of agricultural products. Since the late 1960s, however,
growth rates have fallen below the growth of domestic demand. Although
prolonged adverse climatic conditions played an important role, limited
possibilities for expansion in the traditional agricultural areas, a
relative reduction in public investment for agriculture during the sixties,
and a decapitalization of the sector because of declining profitability
seem to be the main causes of sluggish production.
27.       Although agriculture contributed only 10 percent to GDP in 1974,
the sector is still the largest employer with nearly 40 percent of the
labor force. It is also an important foreign exchange earner. Agricultural
exports totalled US1.E$1 billion in 1974, nearly 40 percent of total commodity
exports. The net surplus of agricultural trade in 1974, however, reached
only slightly more than half the 1972 level. The export structure has
broadened over recent years and hence become less dependent on a few
individual crops than in the past. The most important export products
are cotton and sugar, with 22 percent and 16 percent of total agricultural
exports, followed by ccffee, tomatoes and livestock. Grains and oilseeds
accounted for more tharL two-thirds of total agricultural imports in 1974,
a more than fivefold increase over 1972. Imports of milk powder and skins,
traditionally the most important import products, increased only moderate-
ly.
Land Use and ?opulation
28.       In relation to its size, Mexico has limited agricultural resources.
Mostly because of inadequate rainfall or poor drainage, only 35 million ha
are considered potential crop land out of a total area of nearly 200 million
ha. However, on the avrerage only 14.5 million ha are actually being
harvested of which somewhat more than 4 million ha are in irrigated areas.
Although agricultural production has become more diversified, maize and beans
remain the subsistence crops for the majority of the peasants and the basic
components of the Mexican diet. Maize still accounts for about half the
harvested land, beans for 11 percent, sorghum for 7 percent, and wheat
sugar cane, and cotton for about 4 percent each. Contrary to the cropping
pattern in rainfed agriculture, the irrigated areas - which account for
nearly 40 percent of total agricultural production - show a great variety
of prodacts, comprising fruits, vegetables and perennial crops besides the
basic grains. Half of Mexico's agriculture and forest area is classified
as ranges and pastures but they support only a relatively small portion of
the rural population.



- 10 -
29.       More than 20 million people live in Mexico's rural areas.
Agriculture is by far their most important employment and income source.
About 4 million families, representing close to 40 percent of Mexican
labor force, depend on agriculture for their livelihood. They comprise
three distinct groups: 1.5 million ejidatarios, 1.2 million private
farmers, and about 1.3 million landless families. The number of landless
agricultural workers has been increasing rapidly as a consequence of
limited farm land in relation to an annual rural population growth of
2 percent. Income survey figures indicate that nearly half the rural
families had incomes of less than US$135 per capita in 1970. The rural
production and income distribution is skewed because of excessive land
fragnentation in some parts of the country and because of sharp regional
contrasts in agro-ecological suitability. It is estimated that about
5 percent of all farms supply approximately half the agricultural market
sales, while 80 percent contribute only one-sixth. Similarly, the upper
10 percent of the rural population account for about half the rural income,
while half the population has to accommodate to less than a fifth.
30.       While until recently agricultural policies were successful in
raising production, they did not attend to the pressing problems of rural
unemployment, high degrees of income concentration and accelerated rates
of rural-urban migration. The far-reaching Agrarian Reform Legislation of
1917, under which more than half of Mexico's total land area was
redistributed, was not supported by parallel programs to upgrade supplemen-
tary services and to provide the inputs necessary to bring the distributed
land to full productive use. The relatively small class of modern agricultural
entrepreneurs, on which the country still depends for the foreign exchange
needed to indastrialize, and on which the urban population depends for its
basic consumption needs, contrasts with a large number of peasants in
subsistence agriculture who typically work by traditional methods and barely
participate in the market economy.
Government Strategy
31.       The present government has responded strongly to the need for
increasing agricultural production and improving the situation of the
rural poor.  Increased budget allocations indicate that the government is
giving highest priority to the agricultural sector. Whereas agricultural
investment accounted for 11 percent of total public investment in 1970,
the last year of the previous administration, the authorized agricultural
investment budget in 1975 reached 19 percent of total public investment.
Irrigation investment has doubled since 1970, although its share in total
agricultural investment has declined from 70 to below 65 percent, a
reflection of the limited number of irrigation projects which are economically
justifiable and of the relative neglect of other government services in



- 11 -
the past. Budget allocations for supporting services, intended primarily
to help organize low income farmers and utilize their scarce resources
more productively, have lately increased dramatically.  Compared to 1970,
the Ministry of Agrarian Reform received a sixfold, the Ministry of
Agriculture a fivefold and the state marketing board (CONASUPO) a tenfold
budget increase. Similarly, the PIDER rural development program now
accounts for 16 percent of agricultural investment compared to virtually
none in 1970.
32.       The goverment has also promulgated new legislation aimed at a
more rational and equitable resource utilization. The new Federal Agrarian
Reform Law, enacted a few weeks after the administration took office,
focuses on the transforaation of the ejido into an efficient production
unit, and on rapid legal consolidation of the agrarian reform. The Federal
Water Law, which was prozmulgated in 1972, provides for an organizational
framework to rationalize water management and a ceiling on land holdings
in new irrigation districts which will help achieve a more balanced
distribution of the benefits from public irrigation programs. The new
General Rural Credit Law of 1975 is intended to put the public agricultural
banking system on a sound financial basis while orienting it towards the
low income farmers.
33.       Most important among the institutional measures to implement
the government's agricultural policy more effectively are (i) the creation
of the National Coordinating Commission for Agriculture to close a critical
planning gap and to ensu!re complementarity of government services; (ii) the
establishment of a National Water Plan, under 'a tripartite agreement between
the Mexican Government, the UNDP and the Bank,to formulate comprehensive
long range development plans and adopt key policy decisions for better water
management and rationalization, and (iii) creation of a single public
banking system for agriculture, National Bank for Rural Credit, to make
public credit more respcnsive to the needs of the farmers, particularly low
income farmers, reduce ackdnistrative overlap and increase the lending
volume to the agricultural sector.
34.       Among the many special activities undertaken by the government
are the integrated, multisectoral rural development programs in the Papaloapan
Basin and in selected micro-regions throughout the country (PIDER), both
of which are supported by the Bank. The programs emphasize directly
productive investment; the support infrastructure and technical and
organizational assistance are designed to make them fully effective. The
provision of social infrastructure is intended to transform the rising
incomes from the project into improvements in the quality of life of the
beneficiaries; an essential condition to make the farmers receptive to
technological and social change. Similarly, the government is attempting to



- 12 -
redress the trend of adverse terms of trade between agriculture and the
other sectors of the economy, in order to stimulate private interest and
to enhance farmer participation in its programs. It has increased agri-
cultural support prices considerably after a prolonged period of stagna-
tion relative to other prices and, to make the price policy effective, it
is expanding a system of rural warehouses and building up a network of
rural stores with low priced consumer goods and inputs for agricultural
production.
35.       While the government's financial support has resulted in
impressive improvements in the production and service infrastructure of
agriculture, it has so far had little apparent impact on agricultural
production. The index of crop production for 1973 is, according to
statistics of the Bank of Mexico, lower than the average for 1967/69.
The results of the winter cycle 1974/75, however, provide a first sign
that the efforts of the government may be finally becoming effective.
Average production of the major crops increased by about 9 percent over the
preceding year, and an increase of nearly 5 percent is expected for the
summer crop. In assessing the performance of agricultural production,
however, it has to be noted that government programs were only implemented
on a large scale from 1973 on. In view of gestation periods of between
three and eight years for irrigation investment in Mexico and the gradual
rise of production thereafter, as well as a three to four year lag in the
supporting services to become effective, the production impact of public
investment and service programs will materialize fully only over the next
years.
PART IV - THE P3DJECT
Background
36.       The proposed project would be the fourteenth Bank operation for
agriculture in Mexico. Previous lending in the sector consisted of seven
loans for irrigation, four for agricultural credit and two for integrated
rural development. The project was appraised in May 1975, followed by an
updating mission in August 1975. A report entitled t'Appraisal of the Fifth
Agricultural and Livestock Credit Project"i (Report No. 961-ME dated
January 29, 1976) is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
A loan and project summary is presented in Annex III. Negotiations took
place in Washington from January 15 to January 21. The negotiation team was
represented by Lic. F. Torres on behalf of the Borrower and by Lic.
J. Rodriguez on behalf of the Guarantor.
37.       Beginning with a loan of US$25 million in 1965, the Bank has
made four loans for livestock and agricultural credit, totalling US$275 mil-
lion. The first three loans were disbursed ahead of schedule and the



- 13 -
fourth loan was fully disbursed by October 21, 1975, well ahead of the
closing date of June 30, 1978. Small farmers participated on a modest
scale for the first time under the Fourth Project. The Inter-American
Development Bank has approved total financing of US$71 million for
agricultural credit in Mexico in parallel with the Bank.
Project Objectives and Concept
38.       The proposed project would increase the flow of institutional
investment credit along with technical services to achieve the twin
objectives of: first, expanding Mexico's livestock and agricultural
production so as to meet domestic food requirements and improve the
balance of-payments and, second, raising the productivity of hitherto
neglected ejidatarios and small farmers so as to increase their incomes
and integrate them into the market economy.
39.       Consistent with these objectives, the proposed project would
provide (i) US$165.5 million for a low income producers' subproject (LIFS)
tailored to the needs of the traditional small farmers; (ii) US$149.8
million for a medium irLcome-producers' subproject (MSPS); (iii) US$76.5
million for an agroindcbstries subproject; and (iv) US$21.5 million for
a program of applied research, training and monitoring. The on-farm
investment under the low and medium income producers' subprojects is
expected to be as follows: US$126.2 million for annual crops, US$67.9
million for dairy farming, US$46.8 million for dual purpose cattle and
US$74.4 million for perennial crops, sugar cane and other livestock.
40.       Following the successful though limited experience with the low
income-producers' subproject under the Fourth Project, and subsequent
government efforts to upgrade the complementary services, LIPS would now
account for the major share of on-farm investment under this project.
The threshold to qualifr for LIPS has been defined as net family income
below 1,000 times the regional daily minimum rural wage, ranging
from US$2.00 to US$5.40 at present, which would place the large majority
of project beneficiaries below the 40th percentile family income level,
estimated at about US$1,750 for 1975.  Under LIFS, small farmers would
receive a special package of credit at concessional rates of interest
combined with technical and organizational assistance. The government has
set up a trust fund to reimburse the cost of assistance which participating
banks would provide, either directly or on contract from government agencies,
and to guarantee, up to specified limits, the recovery of loans made by
private credit institutiDns.
41.       Under the medium income-producers' subproject, credit would be
extended to commercial farmers who want to intro-duce more advanced
technology to intensify and increase agricultural production. Borrowing



- 14 -
of any farmer under IaPS of this project, however, would be limited to
US$200,000, including the outstanding balance on earlier sub-loans to
him, so as to exclude large borrowers who have access to alternative
sources of financing. (Project Agreement, Schedule 2, Section 5).
Credit under the agroindustries subproject would be extended to groups
of agricultural producers, including ejida-tarios and small farmers, for
the establishment of slaughterhouses, milk plants, feed mills, grain
storage, fruit processing, saw mills and the like.
42.       The project would also support demonstrations and studies
oriented to practical problems connected with project-financed investment
and help adapt research findings to region-specific technological
packages for ready use by the farmers as well as promote their widespread
application, e.g. low cost calf rearing in the semi-arid and temperate
dry regions, low cost milk production under artificial pasture in the wet
and dry tropics, orchard establishments in the central highlands. The
Fondo would also expand its monitoring activities unler the project and
arrange for periodic evaluation of specific issues e-nerging from the
monitoring process. Further, a limited.number of piLot schemes would be
designed and carried out under the project in selected parts of the
country to test different types of low cost arrangements for coordinated
supply of credit and other services, provision of technical assistance,
management of group activities and farmers' participation in the invest-
ment operations.
Organization and Implementation
43.       As in previous projects, the Fondo would be responsible for
project implementation. The Fondo was established in 1955 by the Govern-
ment as a trust fundwithin the Bank of Mexico to provide the combination
of rediscount facilities to the banking system and technical services
necessary to make a significant impact on agriculture and livestock
development in the country. Lending was to follow commercial criteria
and Fondo was directed to operate on a break-even basis. Through the years,
Fondo's technical assistance has played a major role in the formulation,
appraisal, and supervision of investment plans and its continuance will be
crucial for LIPS under the Fifth Project. Fondo now operates 35 state
and 80 branch offices with more than 1,000 employees, 604 of whom are
technicians.
44.       The Fondo has established a reputation for operational soundness,
efficient organization and technical competence in providing credit as
well as technical assistance. It is expected that Fondo's financing and
proraotional functions will now increasingly extend to the ejido sector and
help tackle issues likely to arise in the development of farmers'
organizations, coordination of credit with input supplies, marketing and



- 15 -
other services. While initially only private banks were supported by the
Fondo, access to Bank fi.nanced rediscounting facilities was extended
successively to all major government-owned agricultural banks. Following
the recent reorganization of the public agricultural banking system, the
Fondo would deal, under the Fifth Project, besides the private ban1s and
the Financiera Nacional Azucarera, mainly with the new Banco Nacional de
Credito Rural (BNCR) and its twelve affiliated regional banks. The BNCR,
or any other public credit institution which has not participated under
the previous projects, would be eligible for disbursement under the
project only after Bank approval (Project Agreement, Section 2.05). For
the purpose of determining the eligibility of BNCR, the Guarantor would
prepare a detailed repor.~t on, inter alia, (i) BNCR's financial accounts,
(ii) its operational po:Licies and procedures, (iii) progress made in the
establishment of the regional BNCR system and steps taken to rationalize
staff and branch networlc, (iv) progress made in the transfer of assets and
liabilities of other public credit institutions to BtICR, (v) improvements
in collecting loans, including overdue loans, and (vi.) BNCR's organizational
structure. Furthermore, the Guarantor would furnish to the Bank, not later
than nine months after signing of the loan, an audited financial statement
of BNCR. (Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.03).
45.       As in the previous projects, all sub-loans would be based on
Fondo supervised appraisal of the technical and financial viability of
on-farm investments. The participating banks, who generally assume the
lending risk, would determine the creditworthiness of the borrower.
Sub-loan terms and Fondo rediscount rates would vary according to the
income of the beneficiaries and the size of the loan. The interest rate
to the borrower under LIPS would be 7.6 percent if he is obtaining
institutional credit for the first time and his net annual income does not
exceed 250 times the daily regional minimum rural wage. Other low-income
borrowers would be charged 9 percent. Private banks would receive a
higher discount margin compared to public banks - 3 aLs against 2 percent -
in view of government financial support for the latter. In all cases,
Fondo would rediscount up to 90 percent of the LIFS sub-loans. Under MIPS,
the interest rate to the borrower would be 11.5 percent for sub-loans under
US$12,000 each and would increase thereafter, by steps, to 14.5 percent
for sub-loans exceeding US$800,000. The sub-loan rediscount would vary
from 90 to 70 percent, depending on the size of the sub-loan, and the
rediscount rates from 8.75 to 12.75 percent, providing the participating
banks with a spread of between 2.75 and 1.75 percent. The proposed interest
rates are already in effect, having been raised only in September 1975 by
between 1.5 and 2.5 percent. The current rates are reasonable in the context
of the interest rate structure in Mexico in general.
Markets and Marketing
46.       The increased production of basic foodstuffs from the project
would find an easy outlet on the domestic market to offset the current



- 16 -
imports and an estimated 4.5 percent annual increase in food requirements.
Most of the marketing for grains and oilseeds will be handled by CONASUF0,
the state marketing board, which has expanded rapidly its storage and
distribution network and which has a proven record of administrative
efficiency. Sugar will be marketed through UNPASA, the national organization
of sugar mills. Increased production will ease recent shortfalls in the
domestic sugar supply and help Mexico take advantage of its comparative
marketing edge in the United States.. Expanded milk production will
substitute for some of the present import requirements; domestic output will,
however, remain short of demand until 1982. Fruits, fresh and processed,
continue to have excellent market prospects both domestically and in the
United States. The outlook for feeder cattle exports is also good in view
of the many American farmers along the border depending on imports from
Mexico for their fattening operations, and substantially lower costs of
cattle raising in Mexico compared to the southern United States.
Project Costs and Financing
47.       The project costs, including contingencies, are estimated at
US$413.3 million of which US$165.5 million would be for low-income producers,
US$149.8 million for medium-income producers, US$76.5 million for agro-
industries, and US$21.5 million for training, demonstration and monitoring.
The proposed loan of US$125 million would finance the entire foreign
exchange costs of the project (US$125 million, or 30 percent of total project
cost).  The balance would be contributed by the Fondo, the participating
banks, and the producers in percentage terms as indicated below:

The poorer farmers under LIPS (para. 45) would contribute at least 3 percent
and the others at least 5 percent of the project cost. The contribution could



- 17 -
be provided in labor and material for which usually cash wages are paid under
existing cooperative arrangements. The farmer contributions under MIPS are
specified as an average;  the minimum for individual sub-loans could be
15 percent. (Project Agreement, Schedule 2, Section 5).
Procurement and Disbursement
48.        As under the previous loans for agricultural credit in Mexico,
procurement under the project would be through normal commercial channels.
It would not be practicable to arrange for bulk procurement and international
competitive bidding procedures, since the items to be purchased by the many
sub-borrowers are relatively small and ordinarily do not lend themselves
to standardization. However, at least three quotations would have to be
obtained for the procurement of machinery and equipment for agro-industrial
units wherever the cost of a single item of equipment, or an assembly
delivered by a single manufacturer, exceeds US$150,000. Further, the Fondo
would make available to sub-borrowers a list of suppliers of agro-
industrial machinery fn)m the Bank member countries and Switzerland
(Project Agreement, Schedule 2, Section 3).
49.        The Bank wouLd disburse against 42 percent of Fondo rediscounts
of project subloans and Fondo's expenditures for training, demonstration
and monitoring.  The Baik loan would be disbursed over a four-year period
with an estimated US$43 million in the first, US$60 miLlion in the second,
US$17 million in the thiLrd, and Us$5 million in the fourth year.
Economic Justification
50.        The proposed project would partly meet the demand for agricultural
investment credit which will emerge from the expanded public investment
and service programs in agriculture, the incentives provided by the govern-
ment's price support poLicies, and the expected improvement in the absorptive
capacity of the reorganized public agricultural system. The economic rate
of return of -on-farm invrestment (low and medium income producers subprojects
accounting for 77.4 percent of the loan) is estimated at about 27 percent,
depending on distribution of funds among different investment activities
which are calculated to yield between 20 and 36 percent according to
representative farm models. The agroindustries subproject (15.4 percent of
the loan) has an estimated economic rate of return of about 30 percent with
a range of 16 percent to 42 percent. The rates of return would remain
satisfactory even if costs would increase and sales receipts decrease by
10 percent each. While the outlays for applied research, training and
monitoring will also have a highly beneficial impact, a quantification has
not been attempted.
51.        The thrust of the project is on increased production. The
additional production of' basic foodgrains and milk would help meet the
rising demand of Mexico's growing population and save foreign exchange
through import substitution while increased production of live cattle, fruits,



- 18 -
etc. should help add to foreign exchange receipts. Consistent with the
general production objective, the project would focus on raising productivity
and hence incomes of small famrers. Family income after full development
is expected to more than double in all-cases, except for dual purpose cattle
in the wet tropics. Of the more than 46,000 families (about 250,000 people)
who would directly benefit from the project, some 37,000 families (about
200,000 people) would belong to low income strata and, furthermore, many
would receive institutional investment credit for the first time. The project
would also help reduce unemployment and underemployment throueh the creation
of 5,000 man-days equivalent per year in addition to the labor requireim-nts
during the investment period of the subloans.
52.       Apart from the increase in tax revenues from increased production
on the farms and in the processing units, the project would also result in
important benefits in terms of institutional development. The Fondo, which
was supported by earlier projects to help build up a system of providing
commercial producers with a combination of credit and technical assistance,
will be enabled through this project not only to maintain and expand these
services to the medium-income farmers but also to extend them to the low-
income farmers in many parts of the country. Apart from demonstrating the
bankability of small farmer-oriented investment operations and helping
private and public banking institutions evolve the right techniques of
financing such enterprises, the project would help in the complex task of
organizing sniall farmers into viable units of joint economic activity.
PART V - LEGAL INSThMIENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Nacional Financie-
ra, S. A., the draft Guarantee Agreement between United M4exican States
and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and Banco de
Mexico, S. A., the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed loans are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
54.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
55.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PJIJECTS IN EXECEJTION 2!
Ln. No. 527   Fourth Irrigation Project:   $25 Million Loan of January 26,
1968; Effec;tive Date: March 1, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
Civil works to be executed under the project were
completed by the end of 1975. The loan is expected
to be fully disbursed by the present closing date of
June 30, 1976. Annual net agricultural production
values, valued in terms of 1967 prices (appraisal
date) are already at a level equal to 87% of those
projected at appraisal for full development.
Ln. No. 695   Fourth Road Project:   $21.8 Million Loan of June 26, 1970;
Effective Date:  October 1, 1970; Closing Date:   December 31, 1976
Seven project roads have been completed and opened to
traffic. The remaining four roads are expected to be completed
at various dates up to the end of 1976, or about two years
behind schedule. This delay was caused by the lag in bud-
getary appropriations for project works and by increased
quantities of works. There have been cost increases on five
of the project roads for these same reasons, and also because
of design revisions and sharp price increases since late 1973.
Ln. No. 793   Zihuatanejo Tourism Project:   $22 Million Loan of January 22, 1972;
Effective Drite: March 30, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Most project-related construction in the Ixtapa tourism
zone was completed by end 1975. A Trust Fund was recently
organized for the provision of urban infrastructure in the
town of Zihuatanejo and the necessary works have been under-
taken since December 1974. It is now estimated that all works
related to this project will be completed early in 1976.
By that time over 500 hotel rooms will be available in the
tourism area and another 400 hotel rooms are expected to be
in service by the end of 1976.
Ln. No. 820   Ports Project:   $20 Million Loan of May 17, 1972; Effective
Date:    August 17, 1972; Closing Date:  June 30, 1976
Progress in execution of the project continues to be
satisfactory. Appraisal of a second ports project, based
largely on studies carried out as a part of this project, is
under way. Port tariffs have recently been increased but
further increases will be needed within a year to put the
port system on a sound financial basis and provide a contribu-
tion to the financing of the port investments proposed in
the next few years including those in the project being appraised.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in that sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weak-
nesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 824   Industrial Equipment Fund (FONEI) Project: $35 Million Loan of
June    1972; Effective Date: October 12, 1972; -Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
After a slow start due to organizational problems, all funds
under the project were committed by June 1975.
Ln. No. 825   Second Railway Project:  $75 Million Loan of June 2, 1972;
Effective Date: August 17, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Progress in implementation of the Investment Plan, procure-
ment and disbursements is satisfactory. Freight traffic carried
in 1974 is considerably higher than in 1973, and early 1975
statistics indicate a continuation of this trend. Locomotive
utilization has significantly improved but freight car utiliza-
tion has deteriorated due to higher turn-around time. Tariffs
have been increased by an average of 44% for freight from
January 1975 and by an average of 22%6 for passenger services
from February 1975. While the financial position of the freight
service will improve substantially with this tariff increase,
the situation remains unsatisfactory for passenger services.
Therefore, further passenger fare increases and rationalization
of passenger trains would be necessary to comply with the
agreements under Loan 825-ME. This is under active discussion
with the government.
Ln. No. 834   Fourth Power Sector Program:  $125 Million Loan of June 23,
1972; Effective Date: April 13, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1975
The construction program has been delayed by over a year
except for frequency unification, which is ahead of schedule.
Recently, the borrower has tried to improve its overall con-
struction performance by strengthening its construction
management and the results of the last six months have been
encouraging. The sector's financial performance is unsatisfactory
and the government is considering remedial measures to improve
it.
Ln. No. 909   Mexico City Water Supply Project:  $90 Million Loan of June 18
1973; Effective Date: Aipril 30, 1974; Closing Date December 31,
1977
Physical execution of the project is progressing satisfac-
torily. However, disbursements from the loan account have been
delayed due to delays in the resolution of administrative
arrangements between the Mexico Valley Water Commission
(the executing agency) and the Federal Government. It is
expected that disbursements from the loan account will soon
increase substantially, reflecting the progress of the project.
A sales contract between the Water Commission and the State

aggregating over $40 million, has receltlv been signed.
In. No. 934   Las Truchas Steel Project:   $70 Million Loan of September 12,
1972; EYfective Date: October 29, 1973; Closing Date:
Decemb-r 31, 1977
D ecution of the project and procurement of the equipment
financed by the loan are progressing as scheduled.
Ln. No. 968   Seventh Highway Project:   $90 Million Loan of Mlarch 1, 1974;
Effective Date:  May 29, 1974; Closing Date:  December ,31, 9h7
Detailed engineering for the six roads incliliderd in
the project, wh:eh was not available at the time of Boaird
pres-ntation, has now beeni compleLad.  The econo.,L z
justifi.caLion of the roads concerned has beenr confirmed
on the basis of final cost, est4mates.  Construction woiks
on twor road sections nave recently started.  The projecL,
as a whole is blweveL suffering cost over-run and is
behind scheduie for lack of sufficient budgetary allocations.
The rmatter has been taken up with the government.
Ln. No. 969   2io Panuco Irrigation Project: $77 Million Loarl of March 1,
197h;  ffective Date:  May 29, 197l; Closing Date:   Decemb_r 31,
1980
Very good progress is being made on construction of this
project and it is anticipated that irrigation service can he
initiated on a 10,000 ha unit of the Las Animas unit by early-
1976. Owners of private land in the project area are largely
electing to he paid for their land in cash rather than by
accepting a 20 ha irrigated holding. This wrill make more
land available for forming ejidos than anticipated at appraisal.
Ln. No. 970   Rio Sinaloa Irrigation Project:   $47 Million Loan of March 1,
1974; Effective Date: May 29, 197h; Closing Date: December 31,
Construction of the Sinaloa de Le,yva Diversion Dam and
the first 17 km of the Bamoa Canal is virtually complete.
Construction will start on the Bacurato dam and storage reser-
voir, the major feature of the project. Negotiations are still
undernay between SRH and the private land owners having water
rights {as part of existing Irrigation District 63) concerning
the size of' holding which may be retained by the owner under
the pro,ject. These will take time but no major problems are
foreseen at this time in project implementation.

Ln. No. 1022  Airport Development Project:  $25 Million Loan of May 20, 1974;
Rffective Date: September 16, 1974; Closing Date: Jlne 30, 197t
The first group of contracts for this Regional airports
Development Project was awarded in Novemher and December 197lt,
for amcunts averaging 15% above appraisal estimates including
contingencies.  Because of budget constraints the execu'-Lng
ageacy,  SOP, has proposed a re-scheduling of the future
con.bract awards to extend the construction periid by two
years. Such an extension would add additional escalation
costs. The government was requested to reestablish the original
project schedule. SOP has given assurances that this will he
accomplished by substantially accelerating the woik dU-ing the
next fiscal.year.

Procurement Arrangements:     Procurement under the project would be through
normal commercial channels. However, at least
three quotations would have to be obtained in
the procurement of machinery and equipment for

agro-industrial units wherever the cost of a
single item of equipment or an assembly
delivered by a single manuf,acturer exceeds
US$150,00O.  Further, the Fondo would made
available to sub-borrowers a catalog of
suppliers of agro-industrial machinery from
the Bank mnmber countries and Switzerland.
Rate of Return:               The economic rate of return of the project is
estimated to range between 20 percent and
42 percent according to the underlying
representative farm models. The rates of return
would rem,ain satisfactory even if costs would
increase and sales receipts decrease by 10
percent each.
