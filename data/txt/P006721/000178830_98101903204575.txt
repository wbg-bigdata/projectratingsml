APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Tnis report appraises the second phase of a major secondzry
education reform program which includes the construction and equipment
of 19 large comprehensive secondary schools. The first phase, compri-
sing ten such schools, is being implemented with the help of a Bank
loan of US$7.6 million. The loan was approved in July 1968 (Loan No.
552-CO). The first phase is being executed efficiently by a competent
project unit, and should be completed before the closing date, Decem-
ber 31, 1971.
ii.       The proposed project constitutes the second phase of the above-
mentioned program and consists of:
- constructing and equipping the remaining nine
comprehensive secondary schools;
- related technical assistance for a total of six
man-years; and
- administrative and operational costs of the project
unit which is to supervise the implementation of the
project.
iii.      This project would reinforce the introduction of the compre-
hensive school concept into secondary education in Colombia and would
be instrumental in furthering the government's policy to prepare stu-
dents both for the labor market and for further studies. The project
schools would have a curriculum that would integrate practical and ac-
ademic subjects into a properly balanced general education which would
increase the range of possibilities for future training and employment.
Furthermore, the proposed project would accelerate the much needed
shift in enrollment in secondary education from the academic branch to-
wards industrial and agricultural branches to meet Colombia's manpower
targets.
iv.       The nine project schools would provide 15,500 student places
which would be used on a shift system to accommodate an enrollment of
31,000. The large enrollment at each school would allow efficient use
of facilities and staff.
v.        Ongoing and planned training programs for administrative,
counselling and teaching staff would meet the needs of the project.



- ii -
vi.       The administrative unit within the Instituto Colombiano de
Construcciones Escolares (ICCE) which is handling the first project
would be responsible for the over-all supervision of this project
also. Consultant architects would be employed to design the schools
and to supervise construction. Contracts for civil works and procure-
ment of furniture and equipment would be awarded on the basis of in-
ternational competitive bidding. Except for the equipment component,
the project, however, is unlikely to attract foreign bidders.
vii.      The proposed loan of US$6.5 million equivalent, corresponding
to 50% of the estimated total project cost, would finance the total foreign
exchange costs of about US$5.9 million (91% of the loan) and about us$o.6
million of local costs (9% of the loan).
viii.     The remainder of the capital funds required fo, the project and
recurrent costs of operating the facilities would be provided by the gov-
ernment and are within its financial capabilities.
ix.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of uS$6.5 million equiva-
lent, 50% of the estimated tota1 project cost, for a period of 30 years
including a grace period of 10 years. The funds would be disbursed over a
three -year period; construction should be completed in about 2-1/4 years.



I. INTRODUCTION
First Education Project
1.01      In the period 1963-66, Unesco and USAID had identified the need
to modernize and change secondary education into a comprehensive system,
and subsequently assisted the government in the elaboration of a major
secondary  education reform program and a related project consisting of the
construction and equipment of 19 large comprehensive secondary schools.
in July 1968, the Bank approved a loan of US$7.6 million (representing 50%
of the estimated total project cost) to help finance the first phase of
this program which comprised ten of these schools (Loan No. 552-C0).  The
remaining nine schools were deferred for a second phase in order to have
sufficient numbers of teachers trained in time to teach the new curriculum,
and to reduce the project to a more manageable size.
1.02      The execution of the first project is proceeding efficiently.
Construction of the ten schools has started, and the project should be
completed before the closing date, December 31, 1971. Initial shortcomings
in project implementation have been overcome; training programs for staff
for the project schools are underway and development of the new curriculum
is expected to be completed on schedule. The second phase, consisting of
the remaining nine schools, is now timely, and would provide continuity
and efficient utilization of project unit staff and of experts provided
by USAID.
The Request
1.03      In March, 1969, the government submitted a request for Bank fi-
nancing for the second phase of the above-mentioned program comprising:
(i) constructing and equipping the remaining nine
comprehensive schools;
(ii) establishment of a computerized data processing
system for the administration of the 19 compre-
hensive schools (including the ten schools in
the first project); and
(iii) use of a closed circuit instructional television
system for the same 19 comprehensive schools.
An appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. K. M. Thint (architect),
0. Markgren (general educator), A. Apodaca (FAO agriculture education),
S. Futagami (educational television, consultant), R. G. Ritchie (tech-
nical education, consultant), and D. K. Zschock (economist, consultant)
visited Colombia in May/June 1966. During appraisal the government re-
quested revision of items (ii) and (iii) above as follows:



- 2 -
(a) As the Ministry of Education plans to introduce a com-
puterized data processing system for the internal ad-
ministration of the Ministry and later for administra-
tion of schools, item (ii) was withdrawn from this
project. After necessary studies, financial assistance
may be requested from the Bank at a later date.
(b) The government now plans to introduce instructional tele-
vision into the entire secondary school system by incor-
porating and augmenting the existing open circuit trans-
mission system being used for primary education. The
wider use of instructional television requires further
studies which could not be completed in sufficient time
to permit consideration of the program within this pro-
ject. Item (iii) was therefore withdrawn but may be
prepared for later submission to the Bank.
1.o4      In consequence, the project as appraised and now recommended for
Bank financing comprises: (a) construction and equipping nine comprehen-
sive schools; (b) related technical assistance; and (c) administrative and
operational costs of the project unit to supervise implementation of the
project. The total estimated cost is US$13.0 million and the foreign ex-
change component, US$5.9 million.
Socio-Economic Background
1.05      The present Colombian government which has no;. entered its fourth
and final year, has carried forward the developmental objectives of the two
preceding governments. In addition it has introduced new programs (e.g.,
in community action, health care, and rural primary education) which are
designed to control the widening gap in standards of living between the mod-
ern and traditional segments of Colombian society.
1.06      Colombia's population, estimated at 20.3 million in 1968, is
growing at nbcut 3.3% annually; it has doubled in less thar. 30 years and
could double again in less than 20 years, if the family planning programs
currently under way by a number of Colombian institutions should prove in-
effective. Any reduction in fertility level would not, however, affect
the secondary school-age population before 1980, nor the size of the labor
force before the mid-eighties.
1.OT      Between 1951 and 1964, the urban population in cities with po-
pulation over 20,000 increased at an average rate of 7.2% annually, four
times the rate of population growth (1.8%) in smaller towns and rural
areas. If this rate of urbanization continues, by 1980, 50% of Colom-
bia's population will be living in cities with over 20,000 inhabitants.
The planned 19 comprehensive secondary schools will be located in 18 de-
partmental capitals which together accounted for 89% of the urban popu-
lation in 1964.



- 3 -
1.08      The labor force, which numbered 5.1 million in the 1964 census,
was estimated at 5.8 million in 1968 with the modern sector accounting
for only 2.1 million. Agriculture represents about 44%, while modern ma-
nufacturing industries employ only 5.4% of the labor force; almost twice
as many workers are engaged in traditional artisan manufacturing whose
zroductivity has remained stagnant at a low level.  Employment expansion
in modern economic activities is less than labor rorce growth, and urban
>aemployennt ratez are between 9 to 15; and rising.  Qualifications of
even the modern l&bor force segment are quite low; in 1963 only about one-
third of all high-level manpower had post-secondary education and only one
out of four workers in the modern economny had any education or vocational
training beyond primary school.
iducation and TrainipE (See also Appendix A)
Administration
1.09      Colomoia has a system of national, departmental, municipal and
private education. The Ministry of Education formulates educational po-
licy and coordinates all educational activities within the country. Re-
organized with assistance from Unesco, the Ministry is implementing ad-
ministrative reforms to increase its effectiveness and efficiency, such
as the creation of semi-autonomous agencies to facilitate funding ar-
rangements and assure continuity of development projects. An example
of such an agency is the Instituto Colombiano de Construcciones Escolares
(ICCE) which is responsible for planning and execution of school buildings
(Caart 1).
1.10      Because salaries of key officials are not competitive with high-
level positions in leading universities or private business, administrative
continuity in the Ministry of Education is a problem. The government in-
tends to improve the conditions of service for public officials, which
should reduce the turnover. In order to assure administrative continuity
in implementing the proposed project, salaries of principal officers and
operational expenditures of the project unit are included within the total
project cost.
Structure
1.11      Primary education lasts five years.  Secondary education, for
which an entrance examination is required, generally consists of a four-
year junior cycle (Plan basico), followed by a two-year senior cycle
(Bachillerato). Primary and Junior secondary school leavers are offered
vocational education of several types. Higher education is available at
universities and specialized post-secondary institutions (Chart 2).

-5-
Primary Education
1.13      Enrollment in primary education has increased by one-third since
1960; 81% of the students were enrolled in public schools in 1968. The
high drop-out rates between grades 1 and 5, about 95% in rural areas and
50% in urbar, areas, are caused chiefly by most rural schools still offering
only two years of education, and only 66% of urban primary schools actually
offering the required five years of education. Double shifts and automatic
promotion are being introduced and a recent study 1/ shows that instruction-
al television has been successfully applied.
Secondary Education
1.14      Secondary-level education has traditionally been divided into
academic, primary teacher training and vocational options in separate
schools spread over the country in small uneconomical units. Enrollment
in secondary education has doubled since 1960 and represented 21% of the
age group in 1968, which is still low for a country in Colombia's stage
of development. Public secondary education has been unable to keep pace
with the increased demand for admission, with the result that private
schools now comprise about two-thirds of the entire secondary school sys-
tem, in spite of their relatively high fees. At present, a high percent-
age (85%) of primary school leavers is admitted into secondary schools.
As primary education is expanded, the percentage will decrease especially
among the lower income groups unless more public secondary education is
made available.
Higher Education
1.15      For 1968, 63,800 students in higher education were enrolled in
65 universities and post-secondary institutes. The uncontrolled rapid
expansion of higher education has resulted in low quality education in
many institutions and high drop-out rates. The government is aware of
this, and a semi-autonomous agency, Instituto Colombiano para el Fomento
de la Educacion Superior (ICFES), has been created for planning, coordi-
nation, supervision and financing of Higher Education. The enrollment
forecast of 199,000 in 1975 would aggravate the existing situation and
also result in an overproduction of university graduates in a number of
fields. If secondary school expansion should continue to emphasize aca-
demic programs, the unfulfilled ambitions of academic secondary school
leavers would inevitably generate pressures leading to still further ex-
pansion of universities. Consequently, a restructuring of the secondary
school system which would offer job-oriented courses and not solely uni-
versity preparatory courses is urgently required. The type of comprehen-
sive school financed under the first IBRD education project in Colombia

pp. 51-75.



-6-
was a first step in this direction and should be expanded further. This
necessitates additional new and modern facilities since existing secon-
dary schools in Colombia are not suitable for remodeling into large com-
prehensive schools.
Strategy for Educational Development
1.16      The Government of Colombia attaches high priority to developing
its educational system, although it is uncertain whether this priority
will find expression in a growing proportion of the national budget allo-
cated to the Ministry of Education. Current prlorities are: to attain
universal primary education by 1975, including a full five years of
schooling for all rural children; to restructure secondary-level educa-
tion by expanding comprehensive education facilities and thereby offering
students academic and pre-vocational or vocational streams; to consolidate
schools into large economic units within reach of population; and to empha-
size quality improvement and growth of graduate-level training and research
in universities. A five-year plan for the period 1970-74 is in preparation
and will presumably include fiscal projections that were not available for
this report.
1.17      The government plans to work toward its objectives in education
by encouraging larger fiscal efforts at departmental and local levels of
government, and by increasing the efficiency of the educational system.
The government intends to decentralize financial and program management
for primary and secondary education, and introduce regional integration
at the university level. It also wants to improve conditions of service
of teachers, rationalize and expand primary and secondary teacher train-
ing, provide free textbooks and teachers' guides in primary and secondary
schools, improve and expand instructional television at primary level and
introduce this medium at secondary level, and provide adult education for
the country's five million illiterates. While these objectives are com-
mendable, their realization will be difficult within the near future.

II. MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS AND THE EDUCATION SYSTEM
Returns to Investment in Education
2.01      There exist recent studies 1/ which have attempted to quantify
the economic benefits from investment in education in Colombia. In gen-
eral, these studies, together with the following assessment of manpower
requirements, support assigning high economic priority to an expansion
of secondary education.
Manpower Requirements (See also Appendix B)
2.02      Employment in the modern component of the economy of the Colom-
bian labor force, estimated at 1.8 million in 1963 2/, probably rose to
2.1 million in 1968 and may reach 2.9 million in 1980. The occupational
composition and educational profile of manpower in the modern component
of the economy demonstrate one of the country's major obstacles to more
rapid economic development. In 1963, 13% were professional and manage-
rial personnel, 23% were clerical and sales workers, and 64% were manual
workers in agriculture and industry. Among high-level manpower (profes-
sionals, managers, executives and technicians), 64% had attended only
secondary schools, 19% had a partial higher education, and only 17% had
university degrees. Of the total vocational manpower (white collar and
blue collar workers), no more than 20% had even a secondary education.
Although enrollment rates in secondary and higher education have been
accelerating in recent years, the educational profile of manpower in
the modern component of the economy probably had not been significantly
improved by 1968.
2.03      Assuming about two-thirds retention of 1963 employment in the
modern sector by 1980, manpower requirements for replacement and expan-
sion during 1963-1980 include 308,000 professional and managerial per-
sonnel, 266,000 clerical and sales workers and 970,000 manual workers
(Annex 3). Assuming further that a pro-rated proportion of these re-
quirements were supplied from among available manpower resources between

2/   Establishment surveys by ICETEX and SENA in 1963 are the only sources
of recent data on characteristics of manpower employed in the modern
component of the Colombian economy. For 1963 estimate and projection
to 1980 of modern employment, see Tables B-2 and B-3 of Appendix B.

1963 and 1968, the manpower requirements for 1968-1980 by educational
level are compared below with the projected output from the existing sec-
ondary schools and the 19 comprehensive secondary schools. Discussions
with Colombian employers, educators and government officials suggest that
manpower targets shown below (and explained in Appendix B) are minimal
and should ideally show higher levels of educational attainment by new
entrants into modern employment.

2.04      As shown in the preceding statement, there is a clear lack of
balance between the needs and projected supply for most categories. The
restructuring of secondary level education with a sharp shift in enroll-
ment distribution away from the academic branch and toward the industrial
and agricultural branches, in both the first and second cycle, and reten-
tion of a much larger proportion of students choosing vocational options
into the fifth and sixth grades will be required to meet the manpower
composition targets. The INEM schools would contribute significantly to
the redistribution of students away from academic and toward industrial
and agricultural education. They should also help in keeping a much high-
er proportion of students enrolled toward their graduation, both at the
first and second cycle in industrial and agricultural options. Further-
more, the curriculum and physical facilities of the INEM schools are flex-
ible and can be adjusted to meet specific manpower requirements.
2.05      The existing secondary education system, together with the 19
INEM schools, may be able to meet the qualitative improvements set as
target for new entrants into modern employment during 1968-80, although
not attaining the desired redistribution. The combined output of the
secondary school system would still leave a deficit of almost 185,000
of the projected total requirements of vocational manpower with a four-
year secondary education. This deficit will have to be made up through
training programs by SENA (Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje) and through
on-the-job training of primary school graduates entering employment di-
rectly. Nevertheless, with the government 's plan to introduce compre-
hensive education into existing general secondary schools, a considerable
improvement in the educational profile of manpowex can oe expected during
this period, and with ongoing rationalization of primary teacher train-
ing, the likely over-production of primary teachers would be curbed.
Education Expenditure Projection
2.06      Total public expenditures on education, which have risen by
more than 8% per year in constant prices since 1960, comprise budgets of
the Ministi.- .i Education, other ministries (Health, Interior, Agriculture,
Defense), state and local governments, as well as SENA and other semi-
autonomous agencies, and are estimated at close to three billion pesos
for 1968, of which the Ministry of Education Budget constitutes roughly
45%. Private expenditures on education are estimated at close to one
billion pesos, so that total expenditures on education in Colombia re-
present about 4% of GDP; while expenditures on education have been ris-
ing more rapidly than GDP, this percentage is still below 5% of their
GDPs that Mexico, Venezuela and Chile, for example, expend on education.
If Colombia can maintain an 8% growth rate of total educational expend-
itures, their proportion of GDP should reach 5% by 1975.
2.07      The Ministry of Education was unable to provide projections of
recurrent expenditures because the Five-Year Plan (1970-74) has not yet
been completed. By- projecting recurrent expenditures at an annual in-
crease of 8% in real terms to 1975, and assuming that investment expend-
itures are maintained at a higher level (i.e., 15% of the Ministry's



- .1 -
budget) than in recent years) the Ministry's total budget woUld have to
expand from 12.1% of the National Budget in 1968 to 13.5'% by 1972 (Annex
I).  This projection includes the recurrent costs of the 19 IM  schools
which would increase from 20 million pesos in 1970 to 120 nillion pesos
in 1975 (in constant pesos) corresponding to 1.5% of total recurrent ex-
penditures by the Ministry in 1970 and 6.0% in 1975. Since the Ministry1s
recurrent resources are expected to rise by 8.0% a year in real terms
(see Annex Qj, it should have the capacity to meet the recurrent costs of
the 19 INEM schools¢
2.08     The XtU'4stryls projections for investment expenditures cover the
period through 12972 odLy3 but include estimates of total project cost of
building the 19 INEYF schools. These wL represent approximately 34% of
total investment expenditures by the Ministry of Education during 1970-
72. The rinistry does not intend to construct additional secondary schools
until after 1974; instead, it expects to accommodate enrollment increases
by gradually initiating two shifts at all schools under its Jurisdiction
(in 1968, 32% of all school rooms under the Ministry's jurisdiction, and
22% of all students enrolled in national schools were on double shifts).
Foreign Assistance to Education
2.09     Prior to 1964, foreign assistance for education in Colombia
had been mainly concentrated on higher education with particular empha-
sis on science facilities, admdnistrative and financial organizations
teacher training and agricultural training and research. The principal
agencies have been UNDP, Inter-American Development Bank, USAID and Ford
and Rockefeller Foundations.
2.10     Since 1964., USAID has provided substantial support to the
instructional television program in primary education and to various pro-
grams in secondary education. The agency financed a two-year secondary
education planning study, and advanced training for Colombian school ad-
ministrators$ guidance counsellors and teachers in preparation for the
INEM program. Since 1968, USAID has financed technical assistance for
implementation of the INEM4 program; further support for technical as-
sistance has been earmarked through 1972.
2..11    In addition to grant funds, UJSAID has recently made a $10 mil-
lion sector loan for education to Colombia. About 25% of direct dollar
expenditures are intended for additional technical assistance for the
INEM schools and Faculties of Education.

III. THE PROJECT
General
3.01      The proposed project provides for the construction, furnishing
and equipping of nine comprehensive secondary schools (INEM), related
technical assistance and administrative and operational costs of a pro-
ject implementation unit. The project schools would provide 15,500 stu-
dent places which would be used on a shift system to accommodate an en-
rollment of 31,000. Estimated annual output would be 3,970 bachilleres,
2,990 of whom would be in pre-vocational streams (Annex 5). All schools
would be day schools, but they would be designed for possible use for
other educational activities after school hours. The project would be
implemented during 1970-73. The physical facilities would be fully uti-
lized upon completion on single shift with students transferred from
schools which are now in rented or unsuitable buildings, and by 1978 on
double shift when adequate number of students and teachers are available
for the new curriculum.
3.02      All project schools are suitably located in departmental capi-
tals (Appendix C, Annex 6 and Map) and enrollments vary, depending on
population of the catchment areas for each school, from 3,000 to 6,000
students per school. These large enrollment figures would permit si}gll-
ficant economies, not only in physical construction, but also it admin-
istration and staffing; an intensive utilization of teaching facilities
and consequently a low cost per student would be possible. In addition
the educational program would be more diversified and staff with more spe-
cialized skills would be efficiently employed than is possible in smaller
schools.
Obiectives and Content
3.03      The curriculum of the INEM schools will offer a comprehensive
secondary education differing markedly from the existing school programs
in Colombia. It will integrate practical and academic subjects into a
balanced general education program and prepare students for a broad range
of possible future training or for employment. The six-year course pro-
gresses in three stages of two years each, from general exploratory studies
in pre-vocational subjects (agriculture, commercial, industrial, and social
service), followed by a greater degree of specialization (Chart 8). There
would be output from two points, at the end of the fourth and sixth years.
Guidance counsellors will assist the students in choosing suitable options
and remedial teachers will be available for special tuition.
3.o4      The graduates should not be regarded as fully trained except for
commercial graduates. All would, however, have a good induction into skills
as a basis for on-the-job training, or in in-service industrial apprentice-
ship courses organized by SENA or in agricultural training programs. Stu-
dents completing the full six years will receive a "Bachiller" diploma
regardless of option, and could obtain further education in institutions



- 13 -
of higher education. The universities in Colombia have formally agreed
to recognize the diplomas awarded by these schools. Such courses would
also enable students to complete university studies or to be trained as
sub-professionals in new three-year courses being developed at many of
the post-secondary institutes.
3.05      Inltially, the schools would offer an economical combination of
options consistent with the types of manpower needed in the area in which
they would be located, with due cognizance of the fact that almost half
of the students would be girls. Later, to adjust to the economic development
of regions and ehe effects of continuing internal migration (para. 1.07),
additional options would be added.  For this reason, the buildings would be
planned for flexibility and for future expansion.
3.06      Suitable opportunities now exist for graduates from the tech-
nical and agricu.tural courses of the project schools. Nevertheless, to
realize the full potential of a comprehensive type of school organization,
it will be necessary to closely coordinate with the training undertaken
by other teaching and training institutions. To this end, the government
should formulate a plan for the long-term development of a comprehensive
secondary education system giving emphasis to industrial and agricultural
education and its articulation with the education offered in such fields
at higher levels, and with institutions providing in-service training and
apprenticeship courses. The government has agreed during negotiations that
it would initiate the formulation of such a plan within six months from the
signing of the loan agreement.
3.07      Close cooperation with agriculture, commerce and industry will
be required to keep the practical courses up-to-date and suited to em-
ployment needs by establishing local advisory committees comprising re-
presentatives of public and private agencies and enterprises. These com-
mittees would advise the schools on curriculum development and assist with
vacation employment and with placement after graduation. Such committees
have already been appointed for most of the first project schools and assur-
ances were obtained from the government during negotiations that similar
committees would be appointed for the nine schools in this project before
the opening of each school.
3.08      The schools should also cooperate with SENA, the agricultural
institutes and institutes of higher education to keep their subject mat-
ter up-to-date, and where practicable, complementary. These organiza-
tions are already working closely together in the teacher training pro-
grams. Confirmation was obtained from the government during negotiations
that it would continue this cooperation and further explore establishment
of complementary courses.
Curriculum Development and Textbook Production
3.09      Colombian teachers with technical assistance provided by USAID
are carrying out INEM curriculum development work which is expected to be
completed on schiedule. More assistance, however, will be required for
continuing development of programs and methods for teaching practical



- 14 -
subjects. Students in the ongoing secondary teacher training programs
are also being introduced to the INEM philosophy. The Government plans
to gradually introduce the curriculum into the rest of the secondary
school system by remodelling some existing schools into feeder schools
for the project schools, and staffing these satellite schools appropri-
ately (para. 2.11).
3.10      Technical assistance is urgently required for the continuing
development of programs and methods for teaching practical subjects.
The provision of six man-years of technical assistance (four man-years
in industrial education and tvo man-years in agricultural education),
therefore, forms part of this project.
3.11      A review of textbooks available in the Spanish language and
adaptable to the new curriculum has been completed. A textbook commit-
tee, composed of teachers, authors and producers, formed early in 1969,
is ensuring timely availability of the textbooks needed in the project
schools.
Administrative and Counselling Staff
3.12      The INEM schools would be large enough to provide administra-
tive services appropriate to a modern comprehensive school. The largest
of the 19 INEM schools will ultimately have 6,000 students using a shift
system; the student body will be divided into administrative sub-units
of 1,000 students (500 in each shift). This school, for example, will
have 228 teachers, and a non-teaching staff of 134, including 6 vice-
principals and 6 counsellors who will each have some teaching responsi-
bilities. The student-teacher ratio will be 25:1 and the student-non-
teaching staff ratio 45:1 (Annexes 7 and 8), as against 13:1 and 30:1
respectively, in existing public secondary schools. The government has
given assurances that these economic student-teacher and student-non-
teaching staff ratios would be maintained for the project schools.
3.13      Some of the highly qualified trainees in school administra-
tion are expected to be appointed principals in the project schools.
Assurances have been obtained from the government that suitably quali-
fied principals would be appointed not later than six months before
the opening of project schools. To assure the smooth operation of these
schools, USAID is providing a specialist in school scheduling and expe-
rienced US secondary school principals to work with Colombian counter-
parts.
3.14      The Ministry of Education has started in-service training
courses for counsellors in seven universities. With the output from
these courses plus those already trained and being trained abroad with
USAID assistance, no shortage of guidance counsellors is foreseen.



- 15 -
Teachers
3.15      The Ministry of Education is studying a new salary structure and
other possible means of improving the conditions of service of teachers in
order to attract full-time, qualified teachers into the public school system.
The government has given assurances that it would appoint a majority of full-
time, qualified teachers to all project schools before the opening of each
school.
3.16      The government has expanded the training of secondary school
teachers at universities, and with the help of a proposed UNDP project
has further plans for further quantitative and qualitative expansion.
To meet the teacher needs for the INEM schools (Annex 9), special acce-
lerated in-service training programs have been started at the universi-
ties for teachers in academic, industrial, commercial, social service,
and agricultural subjects, and are satisfactory. Since the retraining
of teachers without such qualification is not a satisfactory method of
supplying teachers for agricultural subjects for INEM schools, assurances
were obtained from the government during negotiations that it would give
priority to "ingenieros agronomos" and "licencidos en ensenanza agricola"
in the recruitment of agricultural teachers for the INEM schools.
3.17      If the Ministry continues these in-service programs during
the next five years as planned, the staffing requirements of INEM schools
would be satisfied and the entire secondary school system would be provid-
ed with administrators, counsellors and teachers trained in comprehensive
school methods and philosophy. Assurances were obtained from the govern-
ment during negotiations that it would continue these in-service programs
as planned, and that it would keep the Bank informed of the progress of
these courses.
Cost of Project
3.18      The total cost of the project is Pesos 225 million, or US$13.0
million equivalent; the Bank loan of US$6.5 million would represent 50% of
total estimated project cost. The estimated capital costs of the various
components of the project are shown in the table below (Annexes 10 and 11
give further details).

3.19     The project's foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$5.9
million equivalent, slightly more than 45% of the estimated total project
cost. About 9% of the proposed Bank loan of US$6.5 million, abQut us$o.6
million, would be provided for local cost financing.



- 17 -
3.20      The government is providing the school sites without cost to
the project. Suitable sites have been selected for all project schools;
six sites have been acquired and no difficulty is foreseen in acquiring
the three remaining sites. The government has given assurances that it
would acquire the remaining sites on or before June 1, 1970.
3.21      The construction cost estimates for the proposed project have
been derived from school building costs in the first education project,
with data on square meter costs adjusted for each type of space and for
regional differences in costs. During 1960-67, increase in real wage
for labor was about 3.6% per annum, materials about 2.1% per annum and
construction costs in real terms about 3.4% per annum; this trend can be
expected to continue. A price increase allowance of 7% (taking into ac-
count the construction timing) to cover anticipated real rise in building
costs during the period 1969-72, is, therefore, included in the project
costs. A further 10% has been allowed for unforeseen construction and
site development costs to make a total contingency allowance of 17%. A
similar percentage has been allowed for furniture.
3.22      Equipment lists have been reviewed and the revised lists are
reasonable in scale and estimated costs. An allowance of 10% has been
included to cover handling charges and local transportation; 7% to meet
the possibility of rising costs and up-dating of the lists.
3.23      Estimated unit costs on a single shift basis excluding pro-
fessional fees and contingencies are as follows:
Unit Cost (in US dollars)
Site
Cost Category    Unit    Development Building Furniture Equipment Total
(i) Academic &   Student        88        312        80       176       656

(ii) Staff        Staff         780       4500      1220         -      6500
Housing      house
These unit costs are comparable to the unit costs of Bank financed comprehen-
sive secondary schools in Trinidad and Tobago ($652) and Guyana ($995); they
are slightly higher than the first Colombia education project ($522) because
of price escalations and some additional instructional equipment included
within the proposed project. On a double shift basis, the above unit costs
under (i) will be approximately halved. Schedules of accommodation and space
allocations allow for intensive use of school facilities on a shift system.
Confirmation was obtained from the government during negotiations that a
shift system accommodating twice the designed school capacity would be in-
troduced by 1978.
3.24      The foreign exchange component has been calculated on the basis
of the following percentages of expenditures requiring foreign exchange:
(i) construction 33%; (ii) site development 25%; (iii) furniture 25%; (iv)



- 18 -
equipment 90% (v) technical assistance 65%; (vi) professional fees 15%;
and (vii) interest and other charges on the Bank Loan during the construc-
tion period up to September 1972, 100%.
3.25      The government should be able to meet the recurrent expendi-
tures and also its share of the capital costs of the project (para. 2.07).

IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENT
4.01      Administration:  The project unit which is responsible for the
implementation of the first education project, and already established
within ICCE, would continue to be responsible for the implementation of
this project. The government has given assurances that the posts
of: (a) Project Administrator, Project Architect and Project Educator,
and (b) an accountant, and necessary supporting staff, will be filled by
suitable staff during the execution. All appointments to the positions
under (a) would be subject to Bank approval. Salaries of the principal
officers under (a) above and operational expenditures of the project unit
are included in the total project cost.
4.02      Professional Services:  Consultants from the list approved by the
Bank for the first project have been engaged for the design and supervision
of the project. The present ICCE staff designed one school in the first
project, and would be permitted to design a maximum of four project schools
if its other duties allow. The ICCE organization and the project admin-
istrative unit would oversee construction and equipping of the schools.
4.03      Procurement:  All contracts for the supply of equipment and
furniture and for the construction of schools would be awarded under
international competitive bidding. As in the first project: (a)
items would be grouped to the extent practicable to form sizable bid
packages and to permit bulk procurement; and (b) similar procedures
would be used for pre-qualification of civil work contractors and selec-
tion of consultants. It is unlikely that many foreign bidders, except
for equipment, would be interested since Colombia has a well-developed
furniture manufacturing industry and a large, highly competitive construc-
tion industry. Domestic manufacturers of furniture and equipment would
be accorded a margin of preference which will be the existing rate of
customs duty applicable to imported goods or 15% of the c.i.f. landed
cost, whichever is the lower.
Disbursements
4.04      The Bank would finance:  (i) 100% of foreign exchange costs,
for equipment and furniture procured abroad; (ii) cost of technical
assistance and interest and other charges during construction, and (iii)
a percentage (30%) of the cost of civil works, professional services,
equipment and furniture procured locally, and project administration.
In case of a change in the total cost of the project, the percentage
under (iii) would be adjusted at the Bank's option, so that disbursements
would be spread throughout the implementation period, and to the extent
practicable to maintain an average contribution of 50% by the Bank towards
the total cost of the project up to the amount of the Loan. The funds
would be disbursed over a three-year period (Chart 9); construction should
be completed in about 2-1/4 years. Undisbursed funds would be available
for cancellation.

V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained from
the government that it would:
(a) initiate within six months of the signing of the
Loan Agreement the formulation of a plan for the
long-term development of a comprehensive secondary
education system giving emphasis to industrial and
agricultural eeucation and its articulation with
the education offered in such fields at higher levels,
and with institutions providing in-service training
and apprenticeship courses (para. 3.06);
(b)  form advisory committees comprising representatives
of public and private agencies and enterprises for
each of the project schools before the opening of
each school, to keep the principal and guidance
counsellors informed about local employment oppor-
tunities, to advise in the continuing development of
the school program, and to assist in vacation em-
ployment and placement after graduation (para. 3.07);
(c) appoint suitably qualified principals for the project
schools not later than six months before the opening
of each school (para. 3.13);
(d) appoint a majority of full-time qualified .teachers
to all the project schtools before the opening of
each school (para. 3.15);
(e) continue in-service training programs for administra-
tors, counsellors and teachers as planned to meet the
staffing requirements of the INEM schools, and that
it would keep the Bank informed of the progress of
the training courses (para. 3.17); and
(f) continue the project unit established within ICCE for
Loan No. 552-CO until completion of this project, and
that appointments to the posts of Project Administra-
tor, Project Architect and Project Educator would be
subject to Bank approval (para. 4.01);
5.02      The project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$6.5 mil-
lion equivalent for 30 years, including a grace period of 10 years.



APPENDIX A
Education and Training
General Secondary Education
1.        The 1968 enrollment was 405,000 or 68% of total secondary en-
ro'lment.  The output from grade 4 (Plan Basico) was 48,300 and from
grade 6 (Bachillerato) 26,300. The number of repeaters is high and
only about 30% of the entrants finish secondary education. Of the to-
tal output in 1968, 76% of the graduates proceeded to further education
and about 78% of grade 4 output continued to higher grades in secondary
education. Existing school facilities are over-utilized and poorly
equipped; many of the schools have no laboratories and workshops, and
are in buildings not originally built for educational use.
2.        General secondary education has been almost entirely prepa-
ration for university studies with the curriculum based on humanities.
Syllabuses give very little emphasis to modern society and its needs
in agriculture, industry, commerce and social welfare. The methods of
teaching are traditional and examinations encourage rote learning; new
methods are however, being introduced in sciences and mathematics.
Industrial Education
3.        The 1968 enrollment in secondary industrial schools was
27,800; about 82% were enrolled in public schools. Enrollments have
nearly doubled in 5 years; during the same period, however, secondary
students had increased by 2-1/2 times. Often there are more students
applying for first-year enrollment than can be accommodated, but the re-
tention rate to second year is only a little over one-half. For further
progression in the system, retention rates have been improving over re-
cent years.
4.        Courses commence after primary education and have two main
steps. The first five years of study leads to the title of "Experto"
and to positions as skilled craftsmen in industry; a further two years
of study leads to the title of "Bachiller Tecnico" and positions initial-
ly as skilled craftsmen with advancement of higher positions after ex-
perience. It is still possible to obtain the title of "Perito" after
the first four years of study, but this level is dying out. In all cases,
title-holders enter industry without requiring further training, and
suitable students with "Bachiller Tecnico" can and do enter courses of
superior education.
5.        The normal specialties of study at both levels are, industrial
metal mechanics, electrical mechanics, metalwork, foundry and auto-mecha-
nics. In addition, carpentry is available to the "Experto" level only,
and drafting is a specialty in some schools.
6.        The standard of training in the secondary industrial schools
varies from very good to poor, but there seems to be no difficulty in



APPENDIX A
Page 2
absorbing available graduates into both local service industries and
large manufacturing enterprises. It is also likely that courses suf-
fer from the absence of any industrial element during the main stages
of the school program.
7.        Of the 1,500 students studying for the title of "Experto,"
530 entered industry and 940 continued with their studies in 1968.
Some 75% were in the mechanical, auto and electrical trades and only
5% were carpenters or in the construction trade. The number of gradu-
ates as "tecnicos" were 580 with a current growth rate of 30% per year.
8.        It is considered that, at the present time, these schools
fulfill an important function in the supply of trained personnel for
industry at various levels. Since INEM schools will provide an improved,
diversified form of secondary education and will only cope with increas-
ed demand for secondary education, the industrial schools now in exis-
tence will be required for some time to come. They require up-dating
in methodology and improving in physical facilities.
Commercial Education
9.        The 1968 enrollment in secondary commercial schools was 69,200;
about 25% were enrolled in public commercial schools. Enrollments have
grown over recent years, but at an uneven rate.
10.       Courses commence after primary education.  The recently reor-
ganised system consists of a four-year course leading to the title of
"Auxiliar" and, a further two year course leading to "Bachiller Comercial."
Students completing the six-year course may proceed to university.
Courses available are a four year course in administration or a five
year course in public accounting. This is now the only method of obtain-
Lng the title "Contador Publico."
11.       The n-umber of students completing studies as an "Auxiliar" in
1968 were 6,900; these students normally find employment as secretaries,
typists and book-keepers. The number of students completing the "Bachil-
ler Comercial" was 674; these graduates are usually employed as assistant
accountants, statisticians and secretaries. Since some 80% of graduates
are girls, the average length of time in employment is low.
Agricultural Education
12.       The total 1968 enrollment of 7,930 represents 2.3% of all se-
condary school students. Agricultural education was offered in 69 secon-
dary level schools, of these, 46 are official schools.
13.       The typical agricultural school operates in a rented building
without laboratories and other special facilities. A 25-hectare farm
with some equipment and livestock is usually available. Where they are
properly equipped they are costly and inefficient, and all schools pro-
vide specialized education at too early an age. The quality of the grad-



APPENDIX A
Page 3
uates is low. The schools do not meet the demand, which is for skilled
farmers or middle-level agricultural technicians.
14.       Seven agricultural institutes at senior-secondary and post-
secondary level offer specialized training of a terminal character.
Enrollment in 1968 was 4,109 and the number of graduates in 1967 was
355. The graduates are in demand and find well-paid employment. Three
of the institutes are being developed under a UiDP Special Fund project,
and the universities are planning to create new institutes to produce
intermediate-level technicians.
15.       Integration of agricultural education at the secondary and in-
termediate levels should be planned. In principle, the agricultural edu-
cation that is given in the first cycle of secondary should be considered
as merely orientative or introductory; that given in the second cycle of
secondary, such as the INEM's, should be pre-vocational. Only in the
post-secondary stage should the vocational or truly technical agricul-
tural education begin, and it needs to be at least of two years duration
in order to have more mature persons as graduates who have received ade-
quate training.
apprenticeship Training
16.       An autonomous government agency (Servicio Nacional de Apren-
dizaje, SENA), funded by industry tax, operates training centers through-
out the country, giving specialized courses in agriculture, industrial
skills and commercial subjects. In 1968, more than 3,800 apprentices
and 92,500 adults were enrolled, and enrollments have not been expanded
significantly for 1969.
17.       Courses for apprenticeship are three years in duration, alter-
nating semi-annually between the schools and industry. Commercial courses
are generally three years of full-time attendance at a training center.
In addition, many in-service training programs are conducted, generally
of six months duration, but where required, as short as one month. The
entrance requirement for these courses are usually prior employment, and
the actual educational level of the bulk of students in the program is
substantial completion of primary education.
18.       The schools have good sites and fine buildings, and they are
very well maintained. There is always sufficient and good equipment,
and class sizes are low and suitable for the type of training. The
training given is of a high standard and enjoys an excellent reputation
among employers.
Primary Teacher Training
19.       Primary teacher training is conducted in a six-year course
following primary education and comprises four-year secondary education
(Plan Basico) and two-year professional training. In 1968, the enroll-
ment was 54,200 and the output 7,200; girls formed 78% of the enrollment;



APPENDIX A
Page 4
one-third of the colleges were private; and the total number of primary
school teachers was 100,630 including part-time teachers or equivalent
to about 70,000 full-time teachers. The need for teachers in 1975 will
be about 97,500 full-time teachers with a student-teacher ratio of 40:1
(Table A-1).
Secondary Teacher Training
20.       Secondary teacher training is conducted in the faculties of
education at the universities in four-year courses following secondary
education and one-year courses for degree holders. In 1968 the total
enrollment was 6,803 and the number of graduates 872; only 54% of the
students enrolled in the first year completed the four-year course. The
high drop-out rate is, among other things, due to unattractive teachers'
salaries. The government is aware of this, and steps are being taken
to improve the salary structure for teachers. Assistance for improving
teacher training has been requested from UNDP (para. 22).
21.       The total number of teachers in secondary education was 58,090
including part-time teachers, or equivalent to 44,400 full-time teachers,
and the pupil:teacher ratio 13:1 in 1968. About 13,500 teachers are
needed to fill additional needs and replacements during the period 1968-
75, provided the pupil-teacher ratio rises gradually to 25:1 (Table A-2).
With regular courses and special programs (for training professionals
from other careers and for upgrading teachers already in the system) the
government plans to train about 13,000 teachers during this period. If
the entire output from these courses is absorbed into the teaching force
and all worked full-time, then the percentage of qualified teachers would
be 44% in 1975, compared to 25% in 1968.
22.       In 1967 the government requested assistance from UNDP to improve
the training of secondary teachers. The project is aimed at: educational
research, in-service training of 6,500 administrators and supervisors,
training of secondary teachers, and teachers of pedagogical subjects;
and specialists in educational and vocational guidance. The proposed
courses are likely to commence soon at the University of Antioquia and
the National Pedagogical University.
23.       In addition, special accelerated in-service training courses
have been planned at the universities to meet the teacher needs for the
INEM schools:
(a) Industrial: Courses are planned between the faculty
of education in seven universities and the faculty of
engineering or the local SENA institute where there is
no engineering faculty. The maximum number of places
available for the current phase is 330 (requirement for
1970 is 85 teachers). The first course commenced in
April 1969 at the University of Antioquia in collabora-
tion with SENA and is proceeding very satisfactorily.



APPENDIX A
Page 5
(b) Commercial: Courses are planned in seven universities
and are operated in collaboration with SENA. The first
course comuenced in March 1969 for teachers of book-keep-
ing and enrolled 40 students. The total number of places
available in this first phase is 270 (requirement for 1970
is 56 teachers).
(c) Social Services: Courses planned in this area are operated
between the universities and a local secondary school with
home economics facilities where practical work is under-
taken. In the first phase, 185 places are available at
six universities (requirement for 1970 is 27 teachers).
(d) Agriculture: Courses have been planned in four universi-
ties or institutes. Places are available for 137 students
in these courses to cover a requirement of 28 teachers in
1970. Although the minimum qualifications for the course
will be the secondary agricultural diploma together with
a minimum of two years' practical experience, some appli-
cants will be "Ingenieros Agronomos". A strong effort is
necessary to recruit more "ingenieros agronomos" and
"licenciados en ensenanga agricola", since the retraining
of existing teachers without such qualification is not a
satisfactory method of supplying agricultural teachers for
INEM schools.
(e) Academic Subjects: Courses have been planned to start
in August 1969 at 15 universities and 1,450 teachers will
be trained in part-time courses of 4-6 months during one
year.  (Requirement for 1970 is 225 teachers).

APPENDIX B
Manpower Requirements Analysis
1.        Employment expansion and manpower requirements posited in the
quantitative model used in this report represent a reference framework
for educational planning at the level of secondary education in Colombia;
the framework involves estimates of the dimensions and rate of employ-
ment expansion in the modern component of the economy, as well as judg-
ients about the desirable (if not necessary) shifts in its manpower com-
position, and of desirable (if not necessary) improvements in educational
attainment of this manpower.
2.        Rate of return studies suggest that investment to expand se-
condary education seems economically justified and should thus support
the projection of manpower requirements as equally justified. Due to
labor market distortion, however, not all qualified labor may be imme-
diately absorbed. 'lhe manpower requirements projection nevertheless
posits a shift in manpower composition of the modern component of the
economy for 1980, including an increase from 13.0% to 15.7% for mana-
gerial, professional and technical manpower and an off-setting relative
reduction in white collar workers from 22.7% to 20%, to conform more
closely to reasonably appropriate international comparisons (Table B-1).
3.        The analytical framework consists of projections of economic
growth, employment expansion and manpower requirements in the modern com-
ponent of the Colombian economy over the period 1968-80.  With an overall
GDP growth rate of 5% annually, the modern component of the econony will
probably increase its output by 5.6% annually if the traditional component
grows at 2.5% annually (see Table B-2). Given the typical emphasis on
modern component development, this appears as a reasonable assumption.
With the conservative assumption of a 2.8% annual growth rate of produc-
tivity, modern employment, estimated at 2.1 million for 1968, would rise
to 2.5 million by 1975 and to 2.9 million by 1980 (see Table B-3). Man-
power requirements are projected to cover replacements and additions in
this segment of the labor force.
4.        According to the projection framework, there should be no drop-
outs in either the first (four-year) cycle or the second (two-year) cycle,
although about 44% of all first cycle students would be expected to ter-
minate their formal education upon completion of fourth grade. About
one-fourth of those who enter employment upon completion of the first
cycle would be in white collar (clerical and sales) occupations, while
three-fourths would be blue-collar workers (in many different occupations).
5.        The projection of actual output of the existing school system
(para. 2.03) indicates that neither quantitative targets nor qualitative
improvement objectives of the projection would be met without considerable
enrollment expansion and strenous educational reform. The 19 INEM, how-
ever, will help nearly to attain the target for secondary school gradu-
ates, particularly as they will implement the planned redistribution of
graduates away from the academic and toward the vocational branches.



APPENDIX B
Page 2
Quantitative shortages, according to the comparative projections of re-
quirements for and output of four-year secondary school leavers - in-
cluding the 19 INEM schools will total almost 185,000 by 1980 (three-
fourths of them in blue-collar occupations). This deficit will have to
be made up through training programs by SENA and through on-the-job
training of primary school graduates entering employment directly.  The
experience and capacity for expansion of SENA promises to go a long way
toward providing training for workers who have not been able to attain
at least a four-year secondary education.

APPENDIX C
Characteristics of Project Schools Location
(See also Annex 6 and Map)
1.        Economic demand for middle-level manpower with secondary educa-
tion is evident primarily in enterprises that are either being newly es-
tablished or significantly expanded. Economic expansion is strongest and
most diversified in the largest urban centers -Bogota, Medellin, Cali,
and Barranquilla - and considerably less vigorous and diversified in other
cities. Nonetheless, the eight cities - other than Bogota - in which the
second group of INEM schools are to be built, have good prospects for eco-
nomic expansion. The building of a second INEM school at Bogota is timely
and it would help in providing some of the additional student places need-
ed. Even with both the INEM schools operating on a double shift basis,
the 12,000 additional places would represent only 7% of the total secondary
enrollment in Bogota in 1975, or 13% of the additional places required dur-
ing the period 1968-75.
2.        The three cities of Armenia, Pereira and Manizales in the Cauca
valley together constitute a belt of industrial and agricultural devel-
opment that may eventually rival Cali in importance. Manizales, the larg-
est of the three cities, is the commercial center of the region; Pereira
is at the hub of a regional transportation network; and Armenia is the
region's coffee export center.
3.        Ibague and Neiva are two small urban islands in backward but
developing regions of the country. Ibague is a growing commercial and
transportation center. Neiva serves a role similar to Armenia as an
agricultural export center, but in this case for the cattle industry of
the southeastern plains of Colombia (llanos). The city is also the
closest urban center to new oil explorations in Putumaya and to an im-
portant tourist area in nearby San Agustin.
4.        Tunja is important as a commercial center for the region's agri-
cultural production and as a university town; it also anchors a newly de-
veloping industrial belt that may connect it to smaller but more industrial-
ly developed towns to the north. Popayan has considerable attraction as a
tourist center, but limited industrial development prospects. Villavicencio,
located at the western fringe of the llanos, is potentially important as
a commercial center. Each of these three cities is important as a supplier
of migrants to larger urban centers. If more of this manpower can be train-
ed before migrating, it could help both migration to and unemployment in
the larger cities. Moreoever, if these cities expect to attract industry
and tourism (in the case of Popayan and Tunja), they must have the capa-
city to prepare their own manpower resources.

* Ministry of Education projection.
Explanation:  GDP growth rate assumption is 5% annually, and the national budget is
assumed to remain a constant proportion of GDP (11.5% in 1968).  Growth rate projection
of current expenditures for 1969-75 is at 8% annually in real terms.  The average annual
growth rate of recurrent expenditures for 1964-68 was 20%, or 8% annual increases in
real terms with a 12% rate of inflation. The Mission's projection of investment expendi-
tures at 15% of the Ministry's total budget for 1973-75 is strictly arbitrary.
