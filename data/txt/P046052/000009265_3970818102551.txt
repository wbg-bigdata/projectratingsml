Block 1: Project Description
1.   Project Development Objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
The Pilot Project will provide the funding for the preparation of the proposed Ceari Water Resource Management Project
(PROGERIRH).
Project objectives are to:
(a)  Achieve a high level of quality at entry for the proposed PROGERIRH project, including the evaluation and
refinement of the rationale and composition of the PROGERIRH project.
(b)  Develop and refine methodologies, institutional framework and strategies to be used in the implementation and
sustainable operation and maintenance of the PROGERIRH project.
(c)  Evaluate a new small trans-basin diversion project to be built as part of the ongoing Ceari Urban Development and
Water Resources Management (PROURB) project (Ln.  -BR) to test and refine participatory conflict resolution,
and political, social, legal and water allocation mechanisms for integrated basin management.
(d)  Evaluate an appropriate institutional framework for the development and operation of a hydro-meteorological
network and technical support system for integrated water resource management in the State of Ceara
Key outcome and impact indicators will be:
(a)  A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed PROGERIRH project with designs, environmental evaluations and
economic analyses for the components, including a detailed analysis of conservation mechanisms for the Littoral
Coastal Groundwater in the Metropolitan Basin.
(b)  In-depth evaluation and refinement of methodologies and strategies to be used in the integrated management of the
river basins of the State, including evaluation and refinement of operational and decision support models being
developed by the ongoing PROURB project.
(c)  The participatory development of the institutional system, cost recovery system and inter-basin water rights
allocation system for the Jaguaribe/lcapui Transbasin Diversion scheme to be constructed as a part of the ongoing
PROURB Project.
(d)  The design and pilot implementation of a real-time hydro-meteorological information system and sustainable
technological support institution to support the integrated management of the river basins in Ceara.
(e)  The development of an experienced and well-trained implementation team to pursue the major project along with
the development and training in procurement procedures compatible with Bank Procurement Guidelines.
2.   Project Components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
Component                           CategQry                 Cost Including      % of Total

Total          12.0             100.0
3.   Benefits and Target Population:
The proposed pilot project would develop, test and evaluate methodologies to implement integrated water resource
management of the river basins within the semi-arid State of Ceara. This will provide the benefit of a well-prepared
major project implemented by a strong and well-trained team. It will also provide the benefit of sound environmental
and economic analysis of project alternatives for the major project (PROGERIRH).
The proposed major project for the integrated basin management of the water supplies of the state will be targeted at
improving the accessibility of the poor rural and urban populations to reliable quality supplies of water. The State has
suffered from cyclical droughts which have severely stressed poor rural and municipal populations of the State. This



Project Appraisal Document                                                                         Page 3
CountPy: Brazil                                                                     Project Title: Ceara Water Pilot
poorer segment of the population represents one of the largest enclaves of poverty in Brazil. The health problems and
economic dislocation caused by insufficient and low quality water supplies during both annual and cyclical drought has
also caused heavy costs to the State in the form of emergency water supply, health support and social support to
unemployed transients caused by the drought. The rural population of the target areas will benefit directly through
reliable access to a quality water supply and through employment opportunities created by a stable water supply. The
urban population in the target areas will benefit from the provision of a more stable source of bulk water supplies of good
quality. The integrated management of water resources in the State through the PROGERIRH Project as prepared by this
Pilot would develop the flexibility to manage water supplies on an inter-basin level to alleviate these shortages and to
stabilize the supply to all areas of the state. The eventual stabilization of the water supply will also promote private
investment, create employment opportunities for the rural poor and stabilize the reliability of this employment.
This Pilot Project would also strengthen the capacity of the State to provide technical support and hydro-
meteorological information to regulate water resources, to administer water rights and concessions and to manage water
resources on a sustainable basis. The Pilot would provide significant environmental benefits through the careful study
and evaluation of methodologies for the preservation and protection of Littoral Zone Groundwater, as the multi-purpose
use of this sensitive area in the metropolitan basin increases. The pilot studies and tests should result in methodologies
which will be transferable and should greatly improve the quality of the proposed PROGERIRH Project. These benefits
should be shared by the population in the both the rural and urban areas of the State.
4.   Institutional and Implementation Arrangements:
Implementation period:                  2 1/2 years
Executing agencies:                     State Secretariat of Water Resources, Ceara
Project coordination:                   The project will be managed and coordinated by a qualified
implementation team within the Secretariat of Water Resources (SRH) of
Ceara.
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.):  Policy guidance will be provided by the Bank and by qualified
consultants.
Accounting, financial reporting and     The project will use the accounting and financial reporting systems
auditing arrangements:               established for the ongoing PROURB project within the State of Ceara.
Auditing will be carried out by independent qualified auditors.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements:    Monitoring and evaluation will be done by the Bank, and by qualified
consultants. The Borrower will prepare and submit to the Bank semi-
annual reports on the progress of project implementation. The Bank will
carry out at least two regular supervision missions per year.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5.   CAS Objectives Supported by the Project:
Document number and date of latest CAS discussion:    14569-BR, June 6, 1995. Discussion on June 29, 1995,
with a Progress Report discussed on June 20, 1996.
The pilot project would support the Bank's assistance strategy for environmental management and rural poverty
alleviation through the development of a system of integrated management of water resources at the State and local
levels to meet the demands of competing uses. The targeted objective would be the alleviation of the impact of annual
and cyclical drought and water shortages on the rural and urban poor through the enhancement of water supply stability,
associated economic stability and job creation, and through the enhancement of participatory mechanisms for the
efficient and decentralized management of the resource.
6.   Main Sector Issues and Government Strategy:
Recent Bank economic and sector work (e.g., Water Resources Management: A World Bank Policy Paper, 1993, and
Brazil - Management of Water Resources, LA I Economic Notes #4, World Bank, September 1995) have identified three



Project Appraisal Document                                                                          Page 4
Country: Brazil                                                                     Project Title: Cear6 Water Pilot
fundamental deficiencies in water resources management which apply to the Brazilian Northeast, including Ceara:
(a) Institutional capacity for the management of water resources is limited. Public agencies generally have weak
management capacity, and inter-sectoral collaboration has been minimal. Water management has traditionally been
highly centralized and with limited participation of users. Appropriate policies are just beginning to be introduced by
PROURB to finance sustainable O&M of the water supply system or to assist in the allocation of scarce water supplies
between competing uses. The development of adequate water use rights systems has been impeded due to the continued
perception of water as a public good rather than an economic good with the potential to be allocated by the private sector.
(b) Infrastructure development, maintenance and management is uncoordinated and inefficient. Storage capacity
and infrastructure necessary for integrated management are insufficient to stabilize supplies during frequent drought
cycles, and have deteriorated due to the lack of funding for adequate maintenance and because of poor coordination
between responsible entities. The large urban center with poorly regulated waste water and effluent discharges has
created major water quality and sanitation problems.
(c) A lack of integrated basin management. This lack of adequate management plans and information systems has
created conditions which compound water quantity and quality problems and exacerbate the problem of inequitable
supplies between basins during annual and cyclical droughts.
The State's strategy is to concurrently address both demand and supply issues to promote effective water resources
management. The Government intends to: (i) coordinate institutional cooperation and strengthen state-level agencies;
(ii) develop cost recovery mechanisms to support the implementation of sustainable operation and maintenance of
hydraulic infrastructure, and decentralize operation and maintenance of water resources infrastructure; (iii) promote the
integrated management of the water resources between and within the watersheds of the state; (iv) promote incentives for
private sector participation; and (v) support the development of the necessary infrastructure, operational plans and
information systems to ensure reliable supplies of water to the various areas of the State.
7.   Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The Pilot Project will evaluate and refine methodologies for integrated management of water within the State. This will
involve several key sectoral issues including public participation, full sustainable recovery of O&M costs, integrated
management at the basin and inter-basin level and sustainable maintenance of infrastructure. It will evaluate the present
implementation of the Ceara Urban Development and Water Resources Management Project - PROURB (Loan 3789-
BR) within the Metropolitan Basin, support the development of water resources management capacity and institutional
framework necessary to provide water for multi-purpose use within the lcapui Basin, including cost recovery
mechanisms, and design and evaluate the impact of a proposed trans-basin diversion from the Ibiapaba Basin to the
Acarau Basin. This would include the analysis of public participation methodologies, alternative allocation and water
rights mechanisms to distribute the scarce resource between basins during periods of shortages and environmental
impacts of such transfers. As recommended in the World Bank Water Resources Management Policy Paper, the project
would use an inter-sectoral approach to water resources management, integrate the water resources ecosystem into the
management plan and incorporate the management of multi-sectoral water demands. In addition, the project would
emphasize decentralization and stakeholder participation in the management of the resource. The project would evaluate
and refine the present institutional and regulatory framework to more fully reflect the economic and social value of water
through education and cost recovery mechanisms. Finally, water supply management issues would be addressed through
the planning and design of a system of institutions and infrastructure to manage the State's river basins in a manner that
would stabilize the supply during droughts, allow the prioritization of supply allocation and alleviate the impacts of
water shortages on the rural poor and the economy of the State in general. Strict criteria would be utilized to prioritize
those works which would have the greatest impact on the stabilization of the bulk water supply. Comprehensive
environmental assessment and adoption of sound and sustainable watershed management practices would ensure
compatibility with environmental objectives, and the implementation of an educational program would help improve
public consciousness for water conservation and water quality protection. The pilot would improve the State's capacity
for water quantity and quality monitoring and strengthen the State's technical capacity to deal effectively with future
developmental problems as they occur.

The main alternative to this pilot project would be the preparation and implementation of the full Ceari Water Resources
Management Project without the benefit of the evaluation and refinement proposed in the Pilot. This would, in all
probability, result in a project that could lag in initial start-up and would move to full implementation of concepts
without fully testing the effectiveness of new ideas and without refinement of the methodologies to be used. This Pilot
effort will significantly lower the risks in undertaking the major project by providing an opportunity to test and perfect
methodologies in the State environment and allowing the customizing of these concepts to fit the economic, social and
political environment existing in Ceara. The primary trade-off of this sequencing will be a delay in the implementation
of the major project until a later point in time. The major benefit of the improved quality at entry should more than make
up for this delay through increased implementation effectiveness and economic savings.
9.   Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies
(completed, ongoing and planned).
Ceara Urban Development and Water Resources Management Project -    Ongoing
This project is the first step in the implementation of the State's
sustainable development plan. This project is developing the legal and
institutional framework that will be evaluated for use on a larger scale
with the Ceara Integrated Water Resource Management Strategy
(PROGERIRH).
Mexico Water Resources Management Project, This project provides a    Ongoing
model of the development of a management strategy in similar
circumstances but with a different political character.
Northeast Irrigation I Project: This project provide examples of   Ongoing
implementation problems that have developed because of inadequate
preparation.
Northeast Irrigation Project - Jaiba: This project provides an example of    Ongoing
the advantages of involving a users' association or district in the
management of a water resource project or projects.
Irrigation Subsector I Project: This project also provides an example of the  Ongoing
potential problems of inadequately prepared umbrella projects
Federal Water Resources Management Project (PROAGUA): This Project Planned and under preparation
will provide significant infrastructure additions to the bulk water delivery
system and will require careful coordination with the proposed Pilot.
Bahia Water Resources Management Project: This project is a companion  Planned and under preparation
project and will test the basin -wide approach to water resource
management.
10.  Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The design of the Pilot project greatly benefits from the lessons learned by the Bank experience with rural development
and water projects in Northeast Brazil.
The semi-arid conditions of the region encounter recurring severe annual and cyclical droughts and persistent poverty, in
which per capita incomes are less than half of the Brazilian average. Throughout this century expensive emergency
relief programs have been needed to make water available for human and animal survival during the dry periods of the
year and during cyclical droughts. Beginning in the late 1 950s, development efforts came under the coordination of the
Superintendent of the Development of the Northeast (SUDENE). The World Bank began systematically supporting
Northeast development in the early 1970s by financing a series of rural development projects and sector operations.
Along with the experience from water and irrigation projects, lessons from the extensive rural development experience in
the Northeast and specifically in Ceara should be taken into consideration, in particular, those from community-based

Country: Brazil                                                                       Project Title: Ceara Water Pilot
development now applied in the Northeast Rural Development Program (NRDP). Lessons learned that are relevant to
PROGERIRH and the Pilot and form the foundation of the design of these projects include:
*  Preparation: The performance of water and irrigation projects in the Northeast has been only marginally
satisfactory because of poor design, preparation and poor commitment of necessary counterpart funding. This Pilot
project will address the first two of these causes through adequate preparation funding. The third will be addressed
through a careful evaluation of the financial capacity of the State to accommodate the additional costs of the
proposed PROGERIRH Project.
*  Participation: Projects should be client-driven and implemented at the lowest practical level with strong
participation by stakeholders throughout the decision-making process.
*  Decentralization: Decentralization of fiscal and investment decisions to the State and local level should ensure
more flexible and efficient project administration.
*  Cost sharing: Sustainability of project investments has greater potential when the users are involved in the
development and management decisions and participate in the formulation of cost-sharing arrangements. Cost
recovery and demand management through appropriate user fee measures that support reliable water delivery, proper
system maintenance and user participation are of critical importance.
*  Accessibility: Technical assistance should be accessible to user-level organizations and should be targeted to enable
them to implement, operate and maintain their own subprojects in a sustainable manner.
*  Environmental: Evaluation of social and environmental implications and impacts are essential to the sustainability
of water projects, and must be coupled with sound and well-managed mitigation programs as a priority component of
projects.
*  Project Management and Procurement: A strong and well-prepared project management team must be organized
as a part of project preparation so that it is ready to begin project implementation at the time of effectiveness.
Standardization of project documents and training during the project preparation and evaluation process facilitates
the procurement of goods and services, and adequate financing of project preparation improves the quality of
projects at the time of effectiveness.
*  Quality at entry: Project performance can be greatly improved through adequate funding of project preparation and
design and through adequate testing and refinement of concepts and methodologies to be used in the implementation
of the project. Final design is desirable for components to be implemented during the first two years of project
implementation.
*  Monitoring: User-friendly monitoring and evaluation systems are essential management and planning tools. This
system should be designed as a part of the preparation of the project and should be in place at the outset of the
project.
*  Institutional: Emphasis must be placed on the development of institutional, legal and technical capacity for
sustainable water resource management. Coordination and collaboration among agencies, along with assistance for
institutional capacity building, including training to foster understanding of the integrated approach to water
management and related issues, is a critical component.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Ceara's commitment to political and economic modernization and to socially and environmentally sustainable
development is articulated in the current Sustainable Development Plan of Ceara, Brazil, 1995-1998. Rational use of
water is a key determinant of the success of the Plan's development strategy. Since 1986, the State public administration
has undergone drastic reform, attaining fiscal austerity, increasing the accountability of public service and modernizing
management. The State has assembled a strong preparation team that is pursuing the PROGERIRH Project and that has
quickly adapted to the concept of a Pilot effort. The preparation team and a recent Bank mission concentrated on efforts
to ensure that the Pilot will be compatible with all other work in this sector within Ceara, as well as being compatible

Country: Brazil                                                                    Project Title: Ceara Water Pilot
with the Bank's Water Resource Management Strategy. As a result of this mission, the preparation team prepared a
detailed concept document and pilot project implementation plan within two weeks. The team leader visited Washington
in September 1996 to review progress and to refine the preparation activities. During meetings with the Governor of
CearA in August 1996, he expressed strong support for the pilot effort as representing a logical step in the pursuit of the
PROGERIRH Project and in the implementation of the State's Water Resource Management Master Plan. More
recently, he took steps to accelerate counterpart funding for the PROURB Project and to correct delays in the
implementation of resettlement with regard to that project. The implementation team has been actively supporting the
preparation of the final Project Appraisal Document by developing project implementation plans and updating cost
estimates for the project components. CearA has also taken steps to add qualified experts in environmental and social
impact evaluation to the preparation team to assure quality project design in these areas.
12. Value added of Bank support:
The primary value added through Bank participation has been the introduction of strategies based upon the Bank's Water
Resource Management Paper. This has provided an enhancement of the quality of the proposed major integrated water
resource management project and the continued institutional development within the State's Water Resources Sector.
The Bank is providing technical guidance in the implementation of these new water resource management concepts.
Through participation in this project, the Bank will also develop transferable models for refined methodologies in the
water resource management sector.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 7)
13.  Economic Assessment (See Annex 4): The Pilot Project will provide significant savings by minimizing waste,
mismanagement and slow implementation start-up for the major project. The values to be derived through quality at
entry should significantly exceed the cost of the Pilot Project.
This Pilot Project will undertake the economic analysis of all components of the proposed PROGERIRH Integrated Basin
Management Project, and will provide a detailed and cumulative analysis of the economic viability of the overall project
as well as its individual components. This evaluation will be a key component in the appraisal of the PROGERIRH
project for consideration for financing. The relevant costs incurred with regard to this Pilot will be included in the
economic analysis of the PROGERIRH project as a cost of project preparation.
14. Financial Assessment:
Cost recovery programs have been initiated within Ceara to provide funding for sustainable operation and maintenance of
bulk water storage and delivery systems. Similar cost recovery programs have been instituted for treated water supplies
on a limited scale. The Pilot will evaluate this experience and attempt to refine the methodologies used to improve both
existing programs and prospective programs under PROGERIRH. In addition, the Pilot will evaluate potential
opportunities for public education to create an appreciation of the value of clean reliable water and to enhance the
acceptance of appropriate water charges.
15. Technical Assessment:
The ongoing PROURB project has funded the development of water use cadastres, a water law and water use rights
allocation system, a dam safety program and the development and training of a State Bulk Water Supply Company
(COGERH) with responsibilities for the operation and maintenance of bulk water storage and delivery systems within the
State. This includes the responsibility for the coordination of operations between State and Federal Facilities as well as
the setting of rates and tariffs sufficient to support a sustainable level of operation and maintenance and payment to the
Federal Government (DNOCS) of a Federal Bulk Water Tariff that will support the sustainable operation and
maintenance of the Federal Facilities. The PROURB project is advancing reasonably well, but as these new concepts are
new to the region, they have taken time to gain acceptance and sufficient technical experience for optimum
implementation. The Pilot will evaluate the PROURB efforts, methodologies and progress to date in order to develop
lessons learned that will enhance the implementation of the proposed PROGERIRH Project and build upon the

experiences of PROURB.
The Pilot Project is well designed by staff and consultants that are knowledgeable in the relevant areas of technological
expertise. The development of this project will implement concepts and strategies that are new to this region, and the
Pilot will provide an excellent opportunity to develop, test and refine these technologies. The project design takes this
into account and provides a strong evaluation component which will be supported by qualified staff, consultants and
institutions to ensure quality implementation as well as mid-course corrections where necessary. This project should
provide an increase in technical knowledge and methodology that will be transferable to other projects within Brazil and
within other countries and regions of the world.
16.  Institutional Assessment:
(a)  Executing Agencies: The State of CearA has recently streamlined its project implementation procedures. The SRH
will continue this process. The agency has strong management, good facilities and equipment and well-qualified
personnel to implement the project. It is strongly supported by the present administration and Governor and has
sufficient financial support to provide strong guidance to the project.
(b)  Project Management: Project management will be done by a qualified project implementation team within the
SRH. This team, supplemented with consultants, is in place and is now functioning as the preparation team. It will
be trained and further supplemented in the area of Bank procurement and project management as well as in legal
aspects. The team will use recognized project management software as well as a newly developed loan
management software to maintain continual project control and coordination. A Project Advisory Panel which will
include representation of involved agencies and stakeholders will provide ongoing project coordination as well as
implementation advice throughout the project.
(c)  The Pilot Implementation Team is separate and in addition to the implementation team for the PROURB Project.
This highly qualified team should facilitate the successful implementation of the Pilot concurrently with the
PROURB Project.
17.  Social Assessment:
(a)  One of the principal problems facing the vulnerable rural poor is the lack of a stable water supply. The economic
dislocation and health problems caused by cyclical drought in the region is one of the major causes of transient
populations due to lack of employment and inadequate living conditions. The impact of trans-basin diversion of
water and the stabilization of the supply would be evaluated as a part of the Pilot to refine methodologies for the
mitigation of social impacts and the enhancement of the well-being of these poor segments of the population.
(b)  As the Pilot Project activities will include the evaluation of social impact (including resettlement) and the
development of mitigation plans for such impacts, the social impact of the implementation of the proposed
PROGERIRH Project should be greatly facilitated. The Bank's LATEN specialists in social impact evaluation will
be asked to assist in the review of terms of reference for this work and may also be involved as participants in
supervision teams for the Pilot.
18.    Environmental Assessment:                      Environmental Category:   []A    [Xj B    []C
The Pilot project will provide detailed evaluation and mitigation planning for the PROGERIRH project. One significant
environmental issue that will be examined as a part of the Pilot Project will be the existing Littoral Groundwater Zone
north of the Fortaleza Metropolitan area, including the development of a coastal zone planning process to protect this
resource which is being impacted by multi-purpose development. The Pilot project will involve institutional components.
The small trans-basin project to be developed under PROURB to test trans-basin management methodology is not
anticipated to have significant environmental or resettlement impacts. This is being evaluated at present in conjunction
with the reformulation and implementation of the PROURB project. LATEN will participate in the review of terms of
reference for environmental work and may participate in supervision teams for the Pilot.

20. Sustainability:
The methodologies and preparation involved in the Pilot will contribute to the sustainablility of the PROGERIRH Project
and the management of the resource. Cost recovery and tariff procedures developed by PROURB and refined and
extended by the project will be targeted at financing sustainable O&M of the management system. Critical factors for the
sustainability of both the Pilot and PROGERIRH will be the adoption and enforcement of sustainable cost recovery
practices compatible with the minimization of adverse impacts on the poor and the implementation of sustainable
operation and management practices to assure stable water resource supplies during cyclical hydrologic conditions.
Project design will focus on environmentally sustainable alternatives.

exempt certain groups from the
concepts.
22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Since the process of trans-basin diversion of water has historically created controversy between river basins in other
countries, it can be expected that some opposition could be encountered. Since one of the objectives of the Pilot is to
evaluate such situations and design methodologies to mitigate or ameliorate these problems, the Pilot provides an
opportunity to deal with this situation at the pilot level and to develop methodologies and policies to minimize this
problem during the PROGERIRH Project.
To the degree that the Pilot will evaluate current practices for water resource management and attempt to refine and
improve these practices as well as devise adequate cost recovery mechanisms and water allocation procedures, the Pilot
may well encounter resistance from the variety of vested governmental, institutional and private interests. This could
prove to be somewhat controversial. However, one of the objectives of this pilot is to evaluate and refine methodologies
including the methods of arbitration or resolution of institutional turf controversies.

Annex 4
Cost Effectiveness Analysis Summary
Main Assumptions:
The primary cost effectiveness of this techinical pilot is to assure quality at entry of the prospective
PROGERIRH integrated river basin management Project. It can be assumed that this pilot will prevent
some of the historic cost overruns and waste encoulitered in similar types of projects which have
historically been experienced at average levels of 30% (Loan 2719-BR). Assuming that this occurrence
could be reduced by one-third, the 7.5% savings with regard to the PROGERIRH, whichi is estimated at
US$300 million, the savings of US$22.5 millioll could result in a cost-benefit ratio of in excess of 1.88: 1.

Procurement Methods
All project components financed under the proposed Bank loan would be procured in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement (January 1995, revised January and August 1996). Contracts for
goods estimated to cost more than US$350,000 equivalent would be procured through International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with Bank Guidelines and using relevant standard
bidding documents issued by the Bank. Any modifications to such documents which may be necessary
would have to be agreed with the Bank. National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures would be used
for contracts for goods below US$350,000 and above US$100,000, and shopping procedures would be
used for contracts below US$100,000, in the event that such contracts are required. Consultant services
to provide technical assistance, which are expected to total to about US$10.2 million, would be selected
and engaged following the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (January 1997) and using the
Bank's standard contract form for complex assignments. Procurement arrangements are summarized in
Table A. The procurement schedule for major contracts is shown in Table B.

Bank's prior review of the procurement documentation (advertising, bidding documents, bid evaluation
and contract award). The total value of these contracts would be about US$1.7 million, or about 18% of
all Bank-financed goods and services. All contracts with consulting firms estimated at US$100,000
equivalent or more, and all contracts with individual consultants estimated at US$50,000 equivalent or
more, would be subject to the Bank's prior review of contracts, short lists and selection procedures. In
addition, all consultant terms of reference would be subject to the Bank's prior review. The procurement
thresholds are summarized in Table C.
