Z-E4ORANDUM AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DVWELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA
FOR AN
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Venezuela for US$300.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan, which would be repayable in 15 years, including
five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, would help
support the Government' s agricultural policy reform program and finance an
agricultural sector investment program in Venezuela. The Inter-American
Development Bank is considering a loan of US$200.0 million equivalent as
parallel cofinancing for the project.
2.        Background.  Agriculture and agroindustry account for about 15-20%
of non-petroleum GDP and about 15% of non-petroleum and basic metals exports.
About 13% of the total population is rural. With abundant land resources, the
country has considerable potential for efficiently expanding and diversifying
agricultural production and exports and increasing rural incomes. Over the
past 20 years, however, inconsistent policies, the adverse effects of the
macroeconomic framework, and negative protection vis-a-vis the manufacturing
sector have hampered agricultural development. From 1984 to 1988, the
Governme-t attempted to stimulate agricultural growth by raising producer
prices a,. profits while maintaining low and stable consumer prices through
trade restrictions, a preferential exchange rate and large subsidies to
agricultural inputs and outputs (fertilizers, animal feed, water for
irrigation, credit, cornmeal, milk). The cost of these subsidies reached
about US$1 billion in 1987. This policy was accompanied by increased
budgetary allocations for productive infrastructure and support services. In
general, these policies proved costly and unsustainable and resulted in an
expansion of agricultural production that was built on subsidies and
administrative discretion rather than on underlying economic fundamentals.
With an inward looking food self-sufficiency policy and an overvalued
currency, resources were misallocated within the sector, and the result of
these policies was not a strong agricultural sector, but a weak one.
3.        The ambitious economic reform measures adopted by the Venezuelan
administration which took office in February 1989 (redressing macroeconomic
and debt imbalances, unification and floating of the exchange rate, trade
liberalization in the manufacturing and agroindustrial sectors, financial
sector and public enterprise reform) also included some measures directly
affecting the agricultural/food sector. Some agricultural subsidies were
reduced (fertilizer) or eliminated (animal feed); quantitative trade
restrictions were reduced and tariffs on all imports were reduced and
simplified; credit subsidies through preferential interest rates were
substantially reduced, and preferential interest rates were linked to the
market by basing them on the average non-preferential lending rate of the six
largest commercial banks; and commercitl bank portfolio allocation
requirements to agriculture were reduced. However, the sector is still highly
regulated; quantitative trade restrictions and controls still exist on imports



- 2 -
of many primary agricultural commodities and on exports of some agricultural
commodities; agricultural inputs and credit are still subsidized and portfolio
requirements on commercial banks have been retained. Furthermore, the
expansion of agricultural production and productivity, even for import-
competing commodities, has been retarded by the inefficient use of public
investment expenditures and slow implementation. This has been due to the
institutional weakness of some sector institutions, which are now being
reorganized and strengthened, and the almost total absence in the past of
appropriate systems for project selection and expenditure control in what was
perceived as an unconstrained resource environment.
4.        gationale for 8ank Involvement.  Since 1989, the Bank haa been
assisting the Government in a broad-ranging program of policy and
institutional reform aimed at creating a policy environment conducive to
sustainable growth. In the context of this ambitious reform program,
agricultural policy reforms have been partial in nature and relatively slow in
implementation primarily because of the political sensitivity of the sector
and the importance of the commodities that would be affected by the reform
program. Through its support for the proposed project, the Bank would assist
the Government in deepening and broadening agricultural policy reforms,
particularly with respect to trade, pricing and credit. The Dank would also
be supporting the Government in its efforts to strengthen sectoral investment
and institutional capacity for project selection, planning, implementation,
supervision, and expenditure control.
5.        Proiect Obiectives.  The project would support the Government's
objectives of increasing sectoral efficiency and achieving sustainable
agricultural growth and exports. This would be accomplished by carrying out a
reform program to restructure the incentive system; expanding public sector
expenditure on agricultural infrastructure and services to improve
productivity; increasing the availability of credit to assist the private
sector adjust to the new incentive structure and increase exports; and,
strengthening the sector's institutional framework and project planning
capabilities to facilitate implementation of the reform program and enhance
efficiency in the use of public resources.
6.        Proiect Descgrition.  The proposed operation would have three major
componentss (a) sector policy reform to deepen and complement the policy
measures already introduced through a program of reform In the areas of:
(i) agricultural trade; (ii) agricultural pricing, including producer, input
and retail food pricing; (iii) agricultural marketing, especially in relation
to the divestiture of storage facilities, and the role of public agencies
involved in the agricultural marketing of basic commodities and coffee and
cocoa; (iv) the agricultural credit system; and (v) the legal and regulatory
framework with regard to land titling and tenancy; (b) a four-vear (1992-95)
sector investment proaram including: (i) construction and equipment for rural
roads, drainage, irrigation, rural electrification and some fisheries
infrastructure (about 35% of project costs); ($i) construction and equipment
for plant and animal health and quarantine facilities (about 2% of project
costs); (iii) aerial photography, cartography, land delineation and other
services for the completion of the land cadastre (about 9% of project costs);
(iv) medium- and long-term credit for on-farm private sector investment (about



- 3 -
47% of project costs); (v) the financial restructuring of the Agricultural
Credit Fund (FCA) and other public sector credit institutions (about 6% of
project costs, to be financed exclusively by the Government); and
(vi) technical assistance and training for the institutional strengthening
program (about 1% of project costs); and (c) institutional gtjrnathening to
improve the efficiency of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock <MAC) and
other ector institutions by improving their capacity to select, design,
evaluate and supervise projects, and to improve the organization of the sector
and the quality of its human resources through training.
7.         overall responsibility for managing and implementing the project
would rest with the MAC. The Planning and Coordination Ministry (CORDIPLAN)
and the Ministry of Development would be closely involved with MAC in the
implementation of the agricultural policy reforms, particularly in trade.
Xmplementation of road, cadastre, electrification and training activities
would be carried out by sectoral agencies. Selection of investment projects
for inclusion in the annual investment program would be based on satisfactory
technical, financial, economic and environmental criteria and methodology'.
Bank funds under the credit subcomponent would be transferred by the
Government to FCA in dollar-equivalent bolivares at cost plus a fee to cover
the Bank commitment fee and the multi-currency rink; FCQ would onlend to
eligible financial intermediaries (FIs) at no lese than the average
remunerated deposit rate of commercial banks. Yor subloans financed by the
initial US$20 million of the credit portion of the Bank loan, the FPI would
charge the administered interest rate on agricultural lending, which, in the
case of ICA-financed credit, is equal to 84% of the variable non-preferential
lending rate of commercial banks. For the remaining US$106.8 million of loan
proceeds for credit, the interest rate on subloans would be freely negotiated
between the FIs and subborrowers.
8.         The total cost of the project is estimated at US$900 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$222.8 million (25%). The
Bank loan of US$300 million would finance 60% (or US$133.7 million) of the
foreign exchange costs and 25% (or US$166.3 million) of the local costs. The
Inter-American Development Bank would provide parallel cofinancing in the
amount of US$200 million equivalent and the Government, the remaining US$400
million equivalent (including over US$80 million equivalent from subborrowers
and participating Flo under the credit component). The Bank loan includes
retroactive financing of up to US$10 million for eligible expenditures made
before signing but after approval by the Venezuelan Congress of the public
credit law authorizing the loan. An initial deposit of US$15.0 million would
be made to the project Special Account after loan effectiveness. The Closing
Date would be June 30, 1996.  A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Venezuela
are given in schedules C and D, respectively. A map and the Staff Appraisal.
Report, No. 9250-VE, dated November 6, 1991 are also attached.
9.        Actions Agreeds As conditions cf loan effetiveness, the
Government woulds (a) hire key consultants for institutional strengthening;
(b) prepare satisfactory ICB and LCB model bidding documents; (c) establish a



- 4 -
satisfactory Project Unit in MAC; (d) eliminate the import license requirement
and minimum producer prices for all agricultural imports, except for sugar and
milk plus 2% of the value of agricultural production, and by October 31, 1992,
retain these only for sugar and milk; (e) implement an action plan for sugar
and milk that would bring domestic prices for these products in line with
international prices, and subsequently eliminate the minimum producer prices
for these productst (f) implement a commodity price stabilization mechanism
for six key agricultural commodities until a market-based system for price
stabilization has been put into effect; (g) reduce fertilizer subsidies in
accordance with agreed targets; (h) eliminate the domestic marketing controls
and export monopoly of the National Coffee Fund (FONC F3) and the National
Cocoa Fund (FONCACAO), and present to the Bank and subsequently implement a
satisfactory restructuring plan for these institutions; (i) present to the
Bank the proposed plan of operation and budget for 1992 of the Supply and
Agricultural Service Corporation (CASA); and, (j) prepare a training and
promotion program for FCA, and a training progeam for MAC, for 1992. As
conditions of disbursement, the Government would, for: (a) the initial USS2o.o
million of the credit subcomponent, (i) submit legislation creating a second-
tier agricultural credit institution; (ii) take appropriate action for  he
financial and operational restructuring of FCA; (iii) adopt a satisfactory
timetable and action plan for liquidating the National Agricultural Bank
(BANDAGRO); (iv) issue satisfactory operating regulations for FCA; and (v)
hire consultants for FCA to assist in its restructuring; (b) the second
tranche (USS50.0 million) of the credit subcomponent, (i) create a second-tier
agricultural credit institution; (ii) deregulate interest rates on
agricultural lending and adjust FCA's operating regulations accordingly;
(iii) issue a decree phasing out portfolio requirements for agricultural
lending over a six-month period; (c) the third and last tranche (USS56.8
million) of the credit subcomponent, phase-out completely the agricultural
portfolio requirements; (d) any infrastructure project, include the project in
an economically sound annual investment plan, and if its cost exceeds US$20.0
million, obtain prior approval from the Bank; (e) the credit. cadastre. rugal
electrification and trainina subcomponents, sign contractual arrangements with
the executing agencies; (f) institutional strenathenina component, agree with
the Bank on a detailed plan for training activities; and (g) infrastructure
and credit subcomponents, prepare and initiate implementation of a
satisfactory action plan to strengthen environmental evaluation and
monitoring.
10.       During necotiations. the Government grovided assurances that it
would: (a) implement a system for administering health permits for imports;
(b) implement an action plan for the divestiture of agricultural storage
facilities; (c) carry out a study and implement, by October 31, 1992, the
agreed recommendations to provide agrarian reform beneficiaries with access to
credit; (d) by October 31, 1992, finalize bidding and/or tender documents for
sale of a number of storage facilities equal to no less than 25% of the
aggregate value of such facilities; (e) limit retail price controls and export
licensing to only a small group of basic food items, ensuring that remaining
price ceilings are adjusted to prevailing market conditions to prevent
domestic shortages; (f) limit the role and agreed functions of CASA;
(g) subject proposed investments to be included in the annual investment
program to be financed by the Bank loan to a feasibility study, in accordance



with satisfactory methodology a.nd criteria, present for prior Bank approval
proposed investments costing more than US$20.0 million each, and not later
than October 31 each year, exchange views with the Bank on individual
investments and the annual investment program for the succeeding year;
(h) prior to including irrigation and large drainage works in the annual
investment program, agree with the Bank on an irrigation sector policy,
including cost recovery policy, and demonstrate the feasibility, including
environmental feasibility, of the projects to be financed; (i) hire the
remaining consultants for institutional strengthening by the agreed dates;
(j) jointly undertake with the 8ank an annual implementation review; and
(k) raise the interest rate ceiling of 60%, if necessary, to provide a
reasonable spread to the FIs.
11.       Environmental Asoects.  The credit, fertilizer and irrigation cost
recovery policy reforms proposed under the project would help reduce or
eliminate the negative effects of the previous incentive system on the
environment. As the proposed investment program would consist mostly of
individually small infrastructure works, and there would be no expansion of
the agricultural frontier, the project is not expected to affect the
environment negatively. Nevertheless, in order to ensure that possible
environmental issues are identified at an early stage and addressed promptly
in accordance with the new environmental law in Venezuela, the environmental
ministry would review proposed investments and the project would assist in
strengthening its environmental assessment unit.
12.       Benefits.  The project's economic rate of return is estimated at
not less than 12% based on criteria for the selection of individual
subprojects. In addition, the agricultural sector reform program will:
(a) improve efficiency in the use of private and public resources and in the
intersectoral allocation of resources including credit; (b) improve
competitiveness in agricultural production through increased reliance on
market signals and reduced public sector regulation and intervention; and (c)
strengthen public finances through the conversion of private sector rents into
public sector revenues by substituting tariffs for quantitative restrictions
and eliminating input and credit subsidies. The institutional strengthening
component for MAC and other sector institutions under the loan would lay the
groundwork for a more effective utilization of public sector resources. With
an appropriate policy framework in place, the proposed public sector
investment program would effectively reduce agricultural production costs, and
improve productivity and profitability.
13.       Risks.  The major risks to the success of the project relate to the
overall macroeconomic adjustment program, as well as to specific aspects of
the agricultural reform program. The risk that the project could be
sidetracked by political pressures is mitigated by three factors: the
Government's continued commitment to pursue difficult macroeconomic reforms;
the debt accord last year with the commercial banks (which will provide
increased financial flexibility and resources to the economy); and the strong
support of the international financial community. The transitional adjustment
costs to particular groups of producers who carry considerable political
weight constitute the major interna' risk to the proposed reform program. To
mitigate these transitional costs, the project would provide credit and



improved public infrastructure and services while reducing the level of
subsidies and protection, and would introJuce a les distortionary and costly
price stabilization scheme to reduace the impact of lnternational price
volatility. The measures under the projoct to strergthon MAC and other sector
institutions would also help to conaolidate the process of change.
14.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
