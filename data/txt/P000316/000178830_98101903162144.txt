INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed cre-
dit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$ 10.5 million to the
Federal Republic of Cameroon to assist in financing an education project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Government of Cameroon has requested the Association's assistance
for a project to expand and improve teacher training schools and industrial,
agricultural and general secondary education facilities, and for related
technical assistance. The project was identified by a Bank/UNESCO/FAO mission
in May 1968 and UNESCO assisted the Government in preparing the project in
November, 1968. It was appraised by a mission which visited Cameroon from
January 26 to February 21, 1969. Negotiations with a delegation from the
Government of the Federal Republic of Cameroon led by Mr. Joseph N. Owono,
Ambassador of Cameroon in Washington, were completed in Washington on June
30, 1969.
3.        The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
to Cameroon as of July 31, 1969:
Amount ($ million)
Loan or Credit                                                     Undis-

- 2 --
4.        The slow disbursement of the IDA credit and the Bank loan for the
CAMDEV project in 1967 is due mainly to the fact that this project is to be
carried out over an eight-year period, and that the IDA credit is to be dis-
bursed before the Bank loan. The detailed engineering of the Ngaoundere -
Garoua and Tiko - Victoria roads financed under the US$ 0.55 million engineer-
ing credit approved in 1968 is now being completed. The project was appraised
in March 1969 and is expected to be presented to the Executive Directors later
in 1969/70. The cost of the project is presently estimated to be about US$ 20
million. The Bank and IDA also have under consideration a tea project and a
rice project which should both be ready for appraisal during 1969/70.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
5.   Borrower:           Federal Republic of Cameroon
Amount:             US$ 10.5 million equivalent in various currencies
Purpose:            To assist in financing the development and improve-
ment; of facilities for teacher training, and indus-
trial, agricultural, and general secondary education
facilities, and related technical assistance
Amortization:        In 50 years including a 1LO-year period of grace,
through semi-annual installments of one half of
one percent from December 15, 1979 through June 15,
1989 and one and one half percent from December 15,
1989 through June 15, 2019
Service Charge:      3/4 of one percent
PART III - THE PROJECT
6.        A report on the proposed project entitled "Appraisal of an Education
Project in Cameroon' (PE-5a) is attached.   The educational system in Cameroon
is well developed compared with those of many other African countries, par-
ticularly for primary education, which is the financial and administrative
responsibility of the two State Governments. Effective enrollment ratios of
about 75 percent of the primary school age population have been achieved in
both East and West Cameroon.
7.        Enrollment in secondary education amounts to under 7 percent of the
school age population. Failure rates are high and output is so low that the
University of Cameroon does not obtain the required intake and the economy of
Cameroon does not receive an adequate supply of educated and trained middle-
and high-level workers.



8.        Secondary education is to receive greater emphasis: the proposed
project represents most of the expansion and improvement programs to be car-
ried out during the next three to four years which will:
- increase the output of the secondary system as a whole to correspond
more closely to the manpower requirements of the economy;
- place greater emphasis on technical and agricultural education in
secondary schools; and
- substantially reduce the dependence of general secondary education on
expatriates by increasing the output of trained Cameroonian teachers.
9.        The project would consist of the construction or expansion, and
equipment of three primary school teacher training colleges, a secondary
school teacher training college, fifteen general secondary schools, four
technical schools, and a post-secondary agricultural college. The project
would also include technical assistance to provide experts to reinforce the
Ministry of Education's planning services and specialist teachers in such
subjects as engineering and farm management. The project would be carried
out by a Project Unit within the Ministry of Education. The Chief of the
Unit and the Project Architect have already been appointed by the Government
and are acceptable to the Association. The Government has undertaken to make
available promptly all lands required for the project.
10.       The cost of the project was estimated by the Appraisal Mission to
be US$ 14 million including contingencies. In view of the recent devaluation
of the French and CFA francs, the cost of the project may be slightly less,
but it is not possible to estimate the effects of the devaluation with any
accuracy until its effect on the price level can be seen. A proposed credit
of US$ 10.5 million was agreed during negotiations on the basis of the exist-
ing cost estimate. This amount would finance the then estimated foreign cost
of US$ 9.3 million and about US$ 1.2 million of the local costs. Initially
the result of the devaluation will be for the percentage foreign exchange
component to rise slightly and for the total cost expressed in dollars to be
reduced, but in view of the uncer-tain and relatively minor nature of the
changes that would be involved, I propose that the project should be financed
on the basis of the pre-devaluation cost estimate.
11.       Local cost financing is, in general, justified in view of Cameroon's
need for external capital as described in paragraph 19 below. This assistance
is particularly necessary at a time when a large part of Cameroon's budgetary
savings will be absorbed by the Government's existing commitments to a few
large high priority projects, notably for railways, roads and telecommuni-
cations.
12.       Careful consideration has been given to the size of the Government's
contribution, which would be US$ 3.5 million, without taking into account the
cost of land acquisition. Some local cost financing is justified for this



- 4 -
particular project because, while budgetary savings are expected to continue
to rise, it is unwise for Government to pre-empt funds for this project to
such an extent that the Government is unable to make an adequate contribution
to future high priority projects such as the road project which is expected
to come forward later this year. The proposed level of financing for this
education project is consistent with this objective.
13.       All construction contracts and procurement would be subject to
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Guidelines; however,
a 15 percent preference would be allowed for local manufacturers, who are
likely to bid to supply furniture. Any savings made on the credit, when the
project is completed, would be cancelled or used to finance minor extensions
to the project, subject to the agreement of the Association. There is to be
no retroactive financing.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
i4.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Association and the Federal
Republic of Cameroon, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and a draft Resolution
approving this credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors se-
parately.
15.       The provisions of the Credit Agreement generally conform to the
pattern of Association education projects. It should be noted that Section
6.01 requires fulfillment of a condition of effectiveness in connection with
the acquisition of land and property rights required for the construction of
schools and colleges included in the Project. Schedule IV (Procurement Pro-
cedures) provides for a 15 percent preference margin for local manufacturers
of instructional equipment and this margin of preference may be extended to
manufacturers located in other member states of the UDEAC customs union.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
16.       An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of the Federal Republic of Cameroon" (AF-79a) dated August 8, 1968, was circu-
lated to the Executive Directors on September 4, 1968 (R 68-171). The con-
clusions of this report remain valid. Basic data on the economy are attached.
17.       Since 1959, real GDP has increased by about 5 percent per year.
Agriculture, which still employs three-quarters of the working population,
accounts for 37 percent of GDP, providing most of the country's foodstuff
and 70 percent of exports. Manufacturing has progressed rapidly during the



-5-
past few years, as has the service sector. The main bottlenecks to growth
are the transportation system and the scarcity of trained manpower.
18.       Government expenditures are divided between the Federal Government
and the two State Government budgets. The Government's management of fiscal
and economic affairs has been generally good, taking into account the diffi-
culties arising from independence, the establishment of the federation be-
tween two different regions, and the progressive elimination of preferences
for Cameroon products in the French market. The financial situation has been
fairly stable in recent years except for 1967 when credit to the private sec-
tor expanded rapidly, resulting in a sudden increase in imports. The conse-
quent decline in foreign exchange reserves was, however, reversed in early
1968. Good fiscal performance is reflected in consolidated Government savings
amounting to about US$ 16 million in 1967/68, or 10 percent of current receipts.
The Federal Government development budget for 1969/70 provides for expenditures
amounting to about US$ 14 million compared with about US$ 9 million in 1968/69.
19.       The second five-year development plan (1966/67 to 1970/71) des-
cribes the government's long-term development strategy: gross domestic pro-
duct is expected to double by 1980 as a result of increasing the rate of
investment from 10 percent to 16 percent of GDP distributed equally between
the private and public sectors. The sectoral allocation of investment is
sound. The plan includes a substantial allocation for investment in transport,
particularly for the completion of the Trans-Cameroon Railway. During the
Plan period, Cameroon should be able to finance almost two-thirds of its
gross domestic investment from its own resources. Public savings, however,
which have increased greatly since the early sixties, are unlikely to contri-
bute more than 25 to 30 percent over the next three years to the public invest-
ments warranted by the country's increasing absorptive capacity. As a result,
total external capital requirements will exceed the foreign exchange compo-
nent of projects suitable for external financing; thus some degree of local
cost financing is justified.
20.       Cameroon's debt service burden is moderate, amounting to about 3½
percent of export earnings. We have been lending to Cameroon on Bank terms
in the past, and intend to continue to do so. Some IDA lending is justified,
however, in view of the country's low income and limited savings capacity,
despite the efforts which are being made to mobilize domestic resources for
economic development.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
21.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Arti-
cles of Agreement of the Association.
