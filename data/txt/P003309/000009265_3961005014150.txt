POWER III PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                     Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA)
Guarantor:                    Government of the Republic of Zimbabwe
Amount:                       US$90 million
Terms:                        20 years, including a 5-year grace period
Project Objectives:           The short-term objectives of the proposed project are to: (a)
minimize the severity of the power shortage in Zimbabwe caused
by the recent drought and facilitate economic recovery by
increasing the performance and reliability of the Hwange coal-
fired power station, Zimbabwe's largest generating station; (b)
reduce losses on the power distribution system; and (c) reduce the
incidence and severity of power blackouts during the power
shortage to minimize the economic and social disruption they
cause. Over the longer term, the project will: (d) selectively
increase the capacity and reliability of the distribution system so
as to serve more consumers when the power shortage is
alleviated; and (e) reduce the unit cost of power and power system
investment by commercializing the power utility, improving the
condition of existing power facilities, economic power pricing and
by short-term technical assistance and training.
Project Description:          The project consists of: (a) operations support, maintenance,
spares, and major overhaul services and selective equipment
upgrades for Hwange Power Station (79.3%); (b) distribution
system reinforcement through the installation of additional
transformer capacity, line uprating, and installation of capacitors
and load shedding devices (9.2%); (c) training and technical
assistance (5%); (d) provision of workshop equipment and
maintenance vehicles (3.6%); and (e) completion of ZESA's
management information system (2.9%).
Benefits:                     The project's major short-term benefit will be to alleviate the
severe shortage of electricity that Zimbabwe faces from now until
the first of the planned high voltage interconnectors with
Mozambique or South Africa is in service in late 1995 or 1996.
The economic cost of the current power shortage to the industrial,
agricultural and commercial sectors has been estimated to average



- jj -
Z$1.36/kWh (USc26/kWh) not supplied in 1992 prices. The
increased availability and reliability of power supply will facilitate
economic recovery from the drought and the expansion of
domestic industry and agriculture, which is essential for the
success of the Economic Structural Adjustment Program (ESAP),
which is now at a critical intermediate stage. By promoting the
commercialization of ZESA and appropriate power pricing, the
project will both reduce the cost and improve the efficiency of
power supply and utilization. Selective technical upgrading of
Hwange Power Station and improved maintenance and provision
of spares will allow Zimbabwe to make more cost-effective use of
this major investment.   Using current tariffs as a very
conservative measure of benefit, the economic rate of return
(ERR) of the short-term power development program, of which
the project is an integral part, is estimated to be 27%.
Risks:                        The risk of not achieving the project's economic benefits is slight.
Without the project, there is likely to be significant unserved
demand for power over the next 2-3 years. Over the longer term,
it will increase the output and reliability of Zimbabwe's largest
and most critical power station and give Lake Kariba time to
recover from excessive water use for power generation over the
past ten years. There is a risk that demand growth will be slower
than forecast, following the introduction of appropriate tariffs.
However, demand would need to be more than 50% below
forecast for the ERR to fall to 10%. There is little technical risk
because the project involves the use of relatively standard
engineering techniques, extensive use will be made of suppliers'
and expert services for implementing the Hwange Power Station
component, and ZESA is a capable implementing agency with a
proven track record.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
L THE ENERGY SECTOR
Economic Background
1.1          With per capita GDP of about US$500 in 1992, Zimbabwe is one of the highest-
income countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  Its economy is relatively well developed, with
manufacturing contributing about 28% of GDP, agriculture 15%, mining 6%, private services 28%
and public services 23%. In consequence, energy use is also high by regional standards. Between
1980 and 1990, real GDP increased at an average rate of 3.4% p.a., slightly faster than population
growth. While potentially more dynamic, the economy was hamstrung by excessive regulation, price
and wage controls, foreign exchange scarcity (due to export growth of under 1 % p.a.) and large
public sector deficits averaging 10% of GDP.
1.2          In 1991, a comprehensive Economic Structural Adjustment Program (ESAP) was
launched to revise these growth-constraining policies. The main components of the Program are: (i)
reduction of the fiscal deficit and tight monetary policy; (ii) liberalization of the exchange rate and
trade regime; (iii) deregulation of business and investment; and (iv) alleviation of the impact of
reforms on vulnerable groups. The Bank supported the first phase of the ESAP with a combined loan
(US$125 million) and credit (SDR 35.9 million) approved December 1991 (Ln. 3434-ZIM). Most
elements of the program are being implemented effectively, including reduction of the fiscal deficit,
exchange rate adjustment, improved export incentives, establishment of an Open General Import
Licensing (OGIL) system and an Export Retention Scheme (ERS). Progress has also been made in
reducing the losses of state enterprises and de-regulating public and private enterprises.
1.3          Sadly, a severe drought in 1991/92 devastated agriculture and seriously curtailed
electric power supply, 50% of which is from hydro-electric sources. Millions of rural inhabitants
suffered shortages of food and water, GDP fell by 8 % and the supply of power was reduced by about
20%, forcing extensive load shedding and the imposition of power consumption quotas. The Bank
contributed drought relief assistance through an IDA Emergency Drought Recovery and Mitigation
Project (EDRMP) of SDR 109.5 million. This credit financed transportation of food and agricultural
inputs, water supply projects and short-term measures to maximize thermal power generation and to
finance power imports. Fortunately, the 1992/93 rains have been close to normal and a much-
improved harvest has resulted. The power supply situation has marginally improved, with more
reliable thermal generation and the resumption of modest imports from Zambia and Zaire. Although
economic activity and power demand remain somewhat depressed, GDP is forecast to rise in 1993
by about 2 %. The Bank is supporting the recovery and deepening of the economic reform program
with a second Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC II) for SDR 90.9 million, which was approved in
June 1993. Economic growth of at least 5% per year is the objective. This will require both more
efficient production and use and more adequate and reliable supply of electricity, which this project
is designed to achieve.

Zimbabwe's Energy Resources
1.4          Biomass. The total area of surviving and accessible woodland with fuel potential
is around 7.5 million hectares, equivalent to about 20% of the national land area, according to a
survey of forest resources completed in mid-1987 as part of the World Bank-funded Rural
Afforestation Project (Cr. 1368-ZIM). The total accessible growing stock of fuelwood is estimated
to be 320 million air-dried tons, with an annual sustainable yield of about 13 million air-dried tons.
1.5          Zimbabwe also produces agricultural residues with fuel potential. The most important
are sugar cane molasses and juices, from which about 30 million liters of ethanol is produced
annually. The ethanol is blended with petrol and used as a fuel for motor vehicles. Bagasse is used
to power the sugar mills and generate surplus electricity for sale to the grid.
1.6          Coal. Zimbabwe has large coal resources located in 21 known coal fields, with
probable reserves totalling about 10.6 billion tons. Over 2 billion tons can be mined by cheap open-
cast methods, and the remainder has underground mining potential. Recoverable reserves are
equivalent to more than 500 years of consumption at current rates. The most important coal mine
is Wankie Colliery, which has total reserves of 642 million tons, of which about 300 million tons are
recoverable. Annual productive capacity is around 6 million tons from surface and underground
operations. High quality, low sulphur coal at the bottom of the seams, with a calorific value of 31
MJ/kg and ash content of less than 18%, is used in process heating and coke production. Low
quality (25 MJ/kg) coal at the top of the seams is used for power generation at the 920 megawatt
(MW) Hwange Power Station adjoining the colliery. The Sengwa coalfield, with economic reserves
exceeding 450 million tons, started small-scale production in 1990 to replace about 200,000 tons of
imported low-phosphorus, low sulphur coal for ferrochrome production. Methane gas with fuel
potential is also present in some of the seams.
1.7          Hydropower.  The hydropower potential of Zimbabwe is concentrated on the
Zambezi River, which forms Zimbabwe's northern border with Zambia. The potential of this stretch
totals, on average, about 37 Terawatt hour (TWh) annually, of which 10.6 TWh has been developed
at the Kariba Dam and Victoria Falls. The Kariba hydroelectric complex has a total installed capacity
of 1,266 MW, with 666 MW at Kariba South in Zimbabwe and 600 MW at Kariba North in Zambia.
Additional hydropower potential within Zimbabwe is not large (about 2 TWh p.a.), since most of the
other rivers have low, seasonally variable flows and small storage sites. The Sabi River in southeast
Zimbabwe has some hydropower possibilities, as does the Limpopo River, which forms the border
with the Republic of South Africa (RSA). About fifty major dams have been built in Zimbabwe for
irrigation and water supply purposes, some of which could be equipped with small generating units
to produce a total of about 2 Gigawatt hours (GWh) annually.
1.8          Neighboring Zambia, with which Zimbabwe is interconnected at high voltage, has
1608 MW of existing hydro capacity and the potential to develop more, including another 4-500 MW
at a low-cost site on the Kafue river. The 2125 MW Cahora Bassa Power Station on the Zambezi
in neighboring Mozambique is severely underutilized, due to destruction of the transmission line to
the RSA. This complex could be expanded at low-cost by the addition of a 500 MW North Bank
Power Station. Zaire also has substantial surplus hydro capacity, which Zimbabwe is currently
tapping via Zambia, and enormous further potential.

1.9          Solar Energy. On average, Zimbabwe receives about 3,000 hours of sunshine
annually and the daily radiation is estimated to be around 2 kJ/cm2, which is relatively high. Solar
water heaters are manufactured locally and installed in some hotels and hospitals. Solar energy is
also used for curing tobacco, the country's main export commodity, and for lighting and radio by a
few hundred households in areas unserved by the grid. The potential of solar systems is limited by
their cost, but use is currently being expanded under a photovoltaic dissemination project funded by
the Global Environment Facility.
1.10         Wind Energy. Meteorological records show seasonally good wind regimes in the
central and southern parts of Zimbabwe. In these areas, windmills are used on remote farms for
small-scale water pumping. However, wind energy is not likely to be a major contributor to the
market for energy in Zimbabwe other than to supplement diesel generated power in remote areas.
Energy Consumpdon
1.11         In 1991, Zimbabwe's final energy consumption totalled 262,000 Terajoules (TJ),
about 6,250 million tons of oil equivalent. Energy forms other than woodfuels ("commercial
energy") accounted for 52% of the total, comprising domestically produced coal and coke (25%),
electricity (both domestically-generated and imported) (12%), and imported petroleum products
(15%). Imported energy (all petroleum products and some power) accounted for 18% of final
consumption, which is summarized in Table 1.1.
1.12         Annual per capita consumption of energy is about 26 Gigajoules, (0.6 toe). This is
high for southern Africa, and reflects Zimbabwe's relatively well-developed and energy intensive
industrial and agricultural sectors. The largest sectoral consumer of energy in 1991 was the
residential sector (48%), followed by industry (26%), agriculture (10%), transport (10%),
commercial and government services (3%) and mining (3%). An energy balance for Zimbabwe in
1991 is presented in Annex 1.1.

1.13         Fuelwood is the major source of energy in rural areas and for poor people, who
usually collect rather than purchase wood. Consumption data are poor, but demand is probably
growing at about the same rate as population growth, around 3% per annum. In some of the more
densely populated and arid communal areas, woodland resources have been severely depleted by
agricultural land clearing and wood cutting for fuel and poles. In response, the Government is
implementing measures to encourage more efficient use of wood in households and rural industry,
to accelerate tree planting (particularly by farmers), improve management of natural forests and
woodlands and, to a very limited extent because of cost, facilitate the substitution of coal, electricity
and kerosene. The forestry institutions are being strengthened to improve the management of public
wood resources, encourage and facilitate private planting through forestry extension, and to ensure
that due regard is paid to the environmental consequences of agriculture and woodfuel issues in land
use planning. The Bank is providing considerable assistance to this effort, initially under the Rural
Afforestation Project and now under the Forest Resources Management and Development Project (Ln.
31790-ZIM). A major Forestry Policy Review that assesses progress and outlines future strategy has
just been completed.
1.14         Coal is used in industry, power generation, agriculture (particularly tobacco curing),
for coke production, and by a few households. In 1991, coal consumption comprised 3.3 million tons
of high-quality steam and coking coal and about 2.3 million tons of low-quality coal for electricity
generation at Hwange Power Station. About 146,000 tons of coal were exported to neighboring
countries. The bulk of the coal was mined from the Wankie Coal Field by the Wankie Colliery
Company (WCC), a mixed public/private sector corporation. A few thousand tons were produced
by the small Sengwa mine, which is operated by a subsidiary of Rio Tinto. Rail transport constraints
periodically limited coal supply and exports during the 1980s, but are being addressed by the
Railways II project (Ln. 3273-ZIM). Consumption is growing by an average of about 1 % per year.

1.15         Petroleum products are procured competitively on the international market. They
are mostly imported through Mozambique via the Beira-Feruka pipeline and then transshipped
internally by rail and road. The country's only petroleum refinery at Mutare has been mothballed
since 1966. The economics of reopening it are unattractive, because it is small and its configuration
does not match Zimbabwe's product demand pattern. About 1.15 million cubic meters (950,000 toe)
of petroleum products were consumed in 1991, 55 % of which was diesel fuel, 30% petroleum/ethanol
blend, 8% jet fuel, 5% illuminating paraffin, and 2% other products. The National Oil Company
of Zimbabwe (NOCZIM) is responsible for procurement and primary distribution of petroleum
products. Retailing is handled by four private marketing companies and, in the case of bulk supplies
to some public organizations, by NOCZIM. Demand for refined petroleum products is increasing
by about 5 % annually and exerts continuing pressure on the balance of payments.
1.16         Electricity is supplied from a mix of hydroelectric and coal-fired thermal power
stations in Zimbabwe and neighboring countries. The 1266 MW Kariba hydroelectric complex on
the Zambia/Zimbabwe border supplies the bulk of the hydropower and the 920 MW Hwange Power
Station the bulk of the thermal power. Three small, old thermal generating stations at Harare,
Bulawayo and Munyati are used mainly for peaking and reserve duty.
1.17         Summary data on recent power generation and sales are presented in Annex 1.2. In
FY91, sales of electricity totalled 8,992 GWh and system maximum demand was 1,578 MW. Over
the previous five years, sales growth averaged just under 3 % per year and maximum demand just
under 4%. In FY92, energy sales and maximum demand were constrained by the impact of the
severe drought on economic activity and on available hydro-electric supply. Sales rose only 2.8%
to 9,248 GWh and maximum demand fell to 1,458 MW.
Energy Sector Organizations
1.18         The Ministry of Transport and Energy (MTE) has overall responsibility for most
aspects of energy supply, efficiency and demand management policy. The major energy organizations
under the Ministry's oversight are the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA), the national
power utility, and NOCZIM, over both of which the Government has traditionally exercised close
oversight. The Ministry of Mines (MM) has responsibility for the coal sector and oversees the major
company involved in coal operations, the Wankie Colliery Company, which is owned jointly by the
Government and the Anglo-American Corporation and operates with considerable autonomy.
Measures to improve woodfuel supply are implemented by the Forestry Commission and the
agricultural extension service.
1.19         Government's energy policy skills are limited, so many energy policy issues are not
subject to adequate technical analysis. ESMAP has offered technical assistance to train sector staff
and help them to: (a) establish a simple, effective energy planning system in the MTE; (b) estimate
key parameters of the planning system, beginning with the economic cost of major fuels; and (c)
evaluate options for reducing the consumption of major energy users and switching to cheaper fuels.

Zimbabwe's Energy Sttegy
1.20         The objectives of the Government's energy strategy are to: (a) improve woodfuel
supply and utilization efficiency, and promote the substitution of modern fuels, where this is viable;
(b) ensure that commercial fuels are supplied reliably, in adequate quantities and at least-cost; and
(c) encourage efficient use of energy by economic pricing and technical assistance in energy efficiency
improvement. Scarcity of foreign exchange for new investment, Government restraint on energy
prices and interference in the operation of the public energy companies have prevented full realization
of these objectives in the past. Recently, however, the Government has implemented a major change
in energy policy as part of its economic reform program. It has committed to: (a) commercialize the
public sector energy companies; (b) allow energy prices to fully cover the financial and economic cost
of supply; (c) launch a national energy conservation program; and (d) facilitate private sector
involvement in meeting energy needs. While it plans to keep ZESA in the public sector, it is
committed to full commercialization of the utility's operations, to more pro-active demand
management, including appropriate power pricing, and to facilitating future private investment in the
power system. Given Zimbabwe's level of development, its legal and institutional framework and the
relatively good technical performance of the energy parastatals, this sector strategy is judged to be
consistent with the Bank's current power sector policy and to provide an adequate basis for providing
financial and technical support to the sector. The priority components of the new power sector
strategy are:
1.21         Power Sector Reform. The objectives of policy reform in the power sector and the
major steps that are being and will be taken to achieve them are outlined in paragraphs 39, 40 and
43 of the Letter of Development Policy (LDP) signed by the Government prior to approval of the
second Structural Adjustment Credit. These sections of the LDP are reproduced in Annex 1.3. In
essence, the measures comprise: (a) granting full autonomy to the ZESA Board on budget-setting,
staffing policies and procurement below a certain threshold; (b) negotiating performance targets for
the utility and encouraging all senior managers to be remunerated on a performance-linked basis; (c)
allowing tariffs to fully reflect the economic cost of power supply; and (d) encouraging the
participation of private investors in power generation and transmission.
1.22         As a first step in the power policy reform program, ZESA and the Government have
adopted a FY94 Operations Plan for the utility. The Plan contains a performance improvement
prograrn and targets for ZESA and action by the Government to reduce its involvement in the utility's
operations.
1.23         Alleviation of the Electricity Shortage. The most urgent technical issue in the
power sector is the current shortage of electricity supply. As noted above, the problem is due largely
to the impact on the hydro-based power system of the exceptional 1991/92 drought, which was the
worst on record, and followed ten years that were also the driest on record. This dry period
exceeded the worst water supply scenarios used in ZESA's power system operation and development
planning. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that Zambia and Zimbabwe overused Lake
Kariba's water resources over the past ten years and failed to secure adequate alternative power
supplies. When coupled with the catastrophic 1991/92 drought, this forced the two countries to
reduce generation at Kariba by 30% in the second half of 1992. In FY92/93, Zimbabwe's total



supply of electricity, including imports, was about 9,000 GWh, over 1,000 GWh less than the energy
sent out in FY91/92. The average rains that have fallen in 1992/93 will not significantly ease the
supply constraint in 1993/94 because the level of Lake Kariba is critically close to the generator
intakes and must be allowed to recover by reduced generation over the next several years. With
power demand increasing as economic recovery takes off, there is a serious risk of supply
interruptions and further power shortages in 1994, 1995 and perhaps 1996, until a new source of bulk
supply can be added to the system. That new supply will be obtained from Mozambique and South
Africa by the construction of two high-voltage interconnectors (para 2.48). In the interim, ZESA's
strategy, which the project will support, is to: (a) restrain demand by raising tariffs; (b) expand its
load management capability; (c) reduce distribution system losses; and (d) improve the efficiency and
availability of Hwange and the three Old Thermal power stations.
1.24         Energy Demand Management. Stimulated by foreign exchange scarcity and the
drought, the Government is simultaneously intensifying its efforts to promote more efficient use of
energy through a combination of appropriate pricing and the provision of technical assistance in
energy management to energy suppliers and users. Power tariffs were raised by 76% in 1992. A
recently-completed SADCC Industrial Energy Conservation Project, supported by CIDA, has
performed energy audits on 20 of medium-size commercial energy users and trained their staff in
energy management techniques. This has reduced energy use at the audited plants by an average of
8%. A national Electrical Energy Efficiency Program of the type implemented in North America is
being developed jointly by ZESA and the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries, with assistance from
Intemational Energy Initiative. The Program includes industrial energy efficiency demonstration
projects in a sample of large power consumers, design of a ZESA power conservation prograrn,
development of efficiency standards for power equipment such as motors, lights, fridges and water
heaters, and identification of opportunities for cogeneration and private power supply. The project
is being actively followed by the Bank with a view to possible co-financing of some of the more
capital-investment proposals through the next IBRD energy project, perhaps with GEF assistance.
Energ Pricing
1.25         Petroleum product prices are fixed by the Government at three levels; wholesale
(NOCZIM to distribution companies), retail, and ex-pump (retailers to consumers). Prices are
reviewed every six months by NOCZIM and changes recommended to the Minister of Transport and
Energy for approval. With the exception of illuminating paraffin (kerosene), the consumption of
which is modestly subsidized to assist the poor, the prices of all products are adjusted cover economic
cost, albeit sometimes with some delay during the recent period of rapid devaluation.
1.26         Electricity. The basic structure of the national electricity tariff is sound, with a
capacity-related fixed demand charge that provides an incentive for consumers to maximize their
power factor and an energy charge that decreases with consumption. However, for the past several
years, the average tariff has been set below the financial cost of supply and prices to residential and
large consumers subsidized by other users. In consequence, ZESA's financial condition was very
weak from 1989 through 1991. In 1992, following launch of the structural adjustment program, the
Government approved an average tariff increase of 76 % over the previous fiscal year. Subsidization
of residential and large consumers was also significantly reduced by higher-than-average increases
for these two groups. For FY93, and despite 10% less sales due to the drought, the average tariff



- 8 -
of Zc. 17.5/kWh (USc.3/kWh) allowed ZESA to achieve a debt service coverage ratio of 1.3 and to
finance a small portion of its investment program from internal funds. A further 28 % tariff increase
was implemented in September 1993. Residential tariffs now cover the estimated financial cost of
service and tariffs to large consumers cover 80% of financial cost, up from 65% in FY92. Given
the critical stage of the ESAP and justified concern about exacerbating inflation and maintaining the
competitiveness of energy-intensive exporters, this rate of progress towards appropriate power tariffs
is considered to be satisfactory.
1.27         While reasonably adequate financially, the average tariff is still below the long-run
economic cost of supply, which is increasing due to recent rapid devaluation of the Zimbabwe dollar
and the heavy future power investment program. The continued divergence between the tariff and
cost of service to different consumer groups also confirms that the tariff structure does not yet fully
reflect the cost of supply to the different consumer categories. An indicator of the future economic
cost of power is its long-run average incremental cost. Based on the firm components of the
investment program, this is estimated to be about Zc.29/kWh (USc.5/kWh) in 1992 prices (Annex
1.4). To bring tariffs in line with the economic cost of supply, ZESA has agreed to estimate either
the long-run average incremental cost or the long-run marginal cost of power for each consumer
group by January 30, 1995, and ZESA and the Government have agreed that tariffs will be adjusted
to reach one or other of these costs by July 1, 1995. This timetable will provide a transition period
before full economic pricing and give consumers time to adjust to the higher tariffs that will result.
1.28         Coal prices are adjusted annually by a cost-plus formula that ensures WCC a 12.5%
return on unrevalued capital assets for domestic sales and an additional 5% for export sales. In late
1992, pit head coal prices ranged from an average of about Z$30/MT for HPS coal sold to ZESA,
through Z$80/MT for higher-quality steam coal, to Z$105/MT for washed coking coal. The pricing
of HPS coal is reflective of the fact that, at the current quantities required by ZESA, its marginal
economic cost of production is very low as it must be removed to reach the high-value coking coal.
The first part of the pricing formula is a monthly fixed charge, Z$4.5 million in late 1992, in addition
to which ZESA pays a relatively low price of Z$8 per ton for its actual off-take.
Past Role of the ak and Lessons from Expenence
1.29         The Bank has been very active in supporting development of the power system in
Zimbabwe and in attempting to deal with the principal subsectoral issues since Independence. The
Power I Project (Ln. 2212-ZIM, US$105 million) helped to finance construction of Stage II of the
Hwange Power Station (2x220 MW), associated transmission works, technical assistance for training
and manpower development and an energy pricing study. The project was completed in 1990 close
to schedule and below its foreign exchange budget. However, the mixture of equipment from
different sources installed at Hwange and cost-cutting economies in the design have caused some
performance problems which this project will help to alleviate. Overall, both the PCR and PAR
concluded that the project achieved its objectives and its benefits are likely to be sustained. In
parallel, the IFC financed expansion of the Wankie open-cast coal mining operations to increase the
supply of coal to the power station in the mid-1980s.
1.30         The Power II Project (Ln. 2900-ZIM, US$44 million), which is currently being
implemented by ZESA, is financing distribution system rehabilitation and reinforcement, operations



- 9 -
support, design and installation of a management information system, workshop equipment, vehicles
and further training. The project is nearing completion and will close in June 1994 after an 18-month
extension. Implementation and disbursements have been managed efficiently and are close to the
original schedules. The major problems have been with achievement of the loan's financial covenants
and retention of experienced local staff. The substantial tariff increases implemented in late 1992
have significantly improved ZESA's financial performance, and the Government has agreed under
the ESAP to implement full economic pricing of power. ZESA's management is being put on
incentive-based pay and more junior staff salaries reviewed. These past problems should therefore
not be repeated under the new project.
1.31         Earlier, the Bank made several loans for regional power development, including a
loan of US$28 million in 1952 to the Government of Southern Rhodesia for urban electrification (Ln.
145-RN); a loan to the Federal Power Board (Ln. 392-RN) in 1956 for the Kariba dam and the South
Bank Power Station and associated high voltage transmission works in Zambia and (then) Southern
Rhodesia; a loan of US$7.7 million in 1964 to CAPC for extension of the high voltage transmission
system in Zambia; and a loan of US$40 million (Ln. 701-ZAM) in 1970 and supplemental loan of
US$42 million (Ln. 701-ZAM) in 1974 to assist Zambia to finance construction of the Kariba North
Bank Power Station, for which CAPC acted as implementing agency. The Project Completion
Reports concluded that these projects were completed in a timely fashion and within cost estimates.
The plants have operated very reliably and are the backbone of the interconnected power system.
1.32         The Bank, in collaboration with other donors, has provided substantial technical
assistance in the energy sector and the power subsector. An Energy Sector Assessment was carried
out in 1981 under the Joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Sector Assessment Program, and was updated
in 1983 under ESMAP. An ESMAP Power System Loss Reduction Study was prepared in early
1983, which identified economically-justified investments in the power distribution system to reduce
technical losses. A Power Sector Management Assistance project under ESMAP assisted Government
with the formation of ZESA and to develop its energy planning capability. In 1990/91, ESMAP
helped the Government prepare an Integrated Energy Strategy to identify the least-cost means of
meeting Zimbabwe's future commercial energy requirements. In 1992, the Bank and ESMAP helped
ZESA revise its System Development Plan in light of the power shortage and to design a consumption
quota system. Throughout this period, the Bank has helped ZESA and the Government develop and
implement a least-cost power expansion program by analyzing alternative investment strategies and
assisting with the mobilization of donor funding.
Bank Group Strtegy and Ratonale for Involvement
1.33         The Bank's proposed role in the power sector both continues and deepens the past
program of assistance and supports and complements the Bank's overall strategy in Zimbabwe. The
major objectives of this overall strategy are to assist the Government to effect the economic
liberalization and restructuring needed to achieve sustained growth. To achieve these objectives, the
strategic power sector must: (a) improve its technical and financial performance so as to provide
adequate quantities and a reliable supply of electricity at minimum cost to facilitate economic
expansion; (b) implement sound pricing policies to ensure efficient use of power; (c) further promote
efficient use of electricity through active demand management and by reducing losses; (d) strengthen
its institutional, manpower and planning capabilities; and (e) continue to follow a least-cost



- 10 -
development path, attract private investment into the sector and make full use of low-cost regional
power supply options.
1.34         The proposed project will contribute to the achievement of these power sector and
overall economic objectives in several ways. First, it will facilitate commercialization of the power
utility. This will increase ZESA's efficiency and facilitate private sector participation in the power
sector. Second, it will sustain past efforts to efficiently operate, maintain and upgrade the strategic
Hwange Power Station, thus making maximum use of its capacity, minimizing the current shortage
of power and facilitating economic recovery. Third, it will reduce losses in the distribution system
to ensure that maximum use is made of available power supply. Fourth, it will encourage economic
power pricing, which in turn will strengthen demand management, and it will allow the Bank to
continue to advise on power policy, on least-cost power system expansion and to assist in the co-
ordination of investment financing.
Consistency of the Project with Bank Power Sector Policy
1.35         Bank policy in the power sector calls for: (a) movement toward the establishment of
a satisfactory legal and regulatory framework; (b) importation of services to improve efficiency; and
(c) commercialization and/or corporatization of public power utilities and participation of the private
sector in power supply. The project is consistent with all three of these guiding principles. On the
first principle, the Government has given an explicit commitment in its Letter of Development Policy
to reform the legal and regulatory framework for the power sector to grant ZESA greater autonomy.
It has initiated a study of the required legal and regulatory reforms and agreed that they will be
included in the FY95 ZESA Operations Plan, which the Bank will review and agree during the
Interim Project Review. On the second, use will be made in the project of a variety of imported
services to improve ZESA's performance. At Hwange Power Station, the project will finance expert
services from the original generating equipment suppliers to undertake all major overhauls and to
trouble-shoot the equipment. Experienced advisers to each of the senior station managers will be
responsible for improving production, maintenance and stores management systems and
documentation. A private Vehicle Fleet Management consultant has been appointed to design and
implement a modern vehicle fleet management system for the utility. On the third principle,
commercialization of ZESA is a basic objective of the Government's power sector policy and the
driving force behind the planned legal reforms and provision of operational autonomy. While the
Electricity Act already explicitly provides for private sector participation in the supply of electricity,
the Government has pledged in its LDP to seek ways to facilitate this.  With regard to
commercialization of ZESA's operations, the Government has approved tariffs consistent with
commercially-sound financial performance, an automatic tariff adjustment formula to compensate for
unanticipated and unavoidable cost increases and incentive-based contracts for senior management.
It has pledged, in the LDP, to remove subsidies, such as tax and customs duty exemptions, to grant
the Board autonomy on personnel policy and to raise the threshold above which ZESA's procurement
is subject to Government review. These and additional regulatory and legal reforms to complete the
process of commnercialization will be included in the FY95 ZESA Operations Plan, which the
Government, ZESA and the Bank will agree in the first half of 1995.

H. THE PROPOSED BORROWER AND IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
ZESA's Legal Status and Opeating Envimnrnent
2.1          ZESA, the proposed borrower and implementing agency, is a national power utility
established under the Electricity Act of 1985. Previously, responsibility for the power system was
divided between the Electricity Supply Commission (ESC), a thermal power generation,
subtransmission and distribution company; four municipal electricity distribution departments (Harare,
Bulawayo, Gweru and Mutare); and the CAPC, which operated the Kariba hydro-electric complex
and the associated bulk transmission system.  The amalgamation of the municipal electricity
departments into ZESA and ZESA's take-over of operational responsibility for CAPC's generation
and transmission facilities in Zimbabwe were completed in 1987. Legal transfer of the CAPC assets
in Zimbabwe to ZESA has been delayed by a disagreement between Zimbabwe and Zambia over
compensation for the split of the CAPC assets and liabilities. The two countries have now agreed
to independent arbitration to resolve the issue. The Bank will be monitoring this process to ensure
that it is completed in a manner which does not adversely affect ZESA's financial viability.
2.2          The Electricity Act stipulates that the functions of ZESA  are to: (i) generate,
transmit and distribute electricity throughout Zimbabwe; and (ii) investigate options for new or
additional facilities for the generation or supply of electricity. The Act allows for the private
generation, transmission and distribution of power, with the consent of ZESA and the Minister, and
on terms acceptable to both parties.
2.3          ZESA's operations are controlled by a Board of Directors. The Minister responsible
for Energy appoints and dismisses members of the Board, which in turn appoints the General
Manager, who is an ex-officio member of the Board. The Board consists of six to nine members,
of which at least one represents the interests of the local authorities.
2.4          The Electricity Act provides that ZESA shall conduct its business on sound
commercial lines. However, the Minister must approve any changes in tariff levels and charges, the
Ministries of Energy and Finance must approve annual capital expenditure budgets and borrowings,
and the Ministry of Labor must approve staff dismissals. Furthermore, ZESA's foreign borrowing
must be arranged through and approved by the Government. A number of other Government
regulations and practices, such as those regulating procurement and customs clearance, have also
limited ZESA's autonomy, and that of other parastatals.
Commemialion of ZESA
2.5          In the past, these Governrment regulations, together with close oversight of operational
decisions, have adversely affected ZESA's performance, which nevertheless is one of the best among
African power utilities. As outlined above (para 1.21), Government has now begun to fundamentally
reform the public enterprize sector. It has decided that ZESA will remain a public corporation, but
that its management will be granted greater autonomy and allowed to conduct its business on fully
commercial lines. Private companies will be able to compete on equal terms with ZESA or to joint
venture with ZESA in future generation and transmission projects.



- 12 -
2.6          With the help of consultants, the Government is reviewing the legislative and
regulatory framework under which ZESA and other major parastatals operate. Their report, to be
completed in the second half of 1993, will propose legal and regulatory reforms to increase the
autonomy and efficiency of the parastatals. With the help of consultants funded under Power II,
ZESA prepared an Operations Plan for FY94, which has been agreed with the Government. This sets
efficiency and technical performance targets for the utility and specifies the steps that the Government
will take immediately to ease restrictions and increase the autonomy of ZESA's management so that
the targets can be achieved. After completing the FY94 Plan, ZESA and the consultants are
conducting a detailed efficiency audit of the utility and developing a long-term efficiency
improvement program. The program will set year-by-year efficiency targets which will be included
in future annual Operations Plans, together with the legal and regulatory reforms that Government
will implement to fully commercialize ZESA's operations. To ensure that the program of
commercialization and efficiency improvement stays on track, it has been agreed that an Operations
Plan for FY95 satisfactory to the Bank that contains appropriate operational and financial targets for
ZESA, a formula for adjusting tariffs for unavoidable cost increases and Government commitments
to the legal and regulatory reforms necessary to complete the commercialization of ZESA, will be
agreed and adopted by both parties by June 30, 1994. An Interim Project Review Mission in May
or June 1994 will review a draft of the plan prior to its finalization.
Thc Zambezi River Authoriy
2.7          Management of the shared Zambian and Zimbabwean stretch of the Zambezi River
on which the main hydro-electric power stations are located is the responsibility of the Zambezi River
Authority (ZRA). The ZRA was established in August 1987 through an Inter-Governmental
Agreement between Zambia and Zimbabwe to take over the river and dam management functions of
the former CAPC. As defined in its enabling legislation, the main functions of ZRA are to:
(a)    operate, monitor and maintain the Kariba dam, reservoir and telemetry stations and
regulate the water level in the reservoir;
(b)   investigate the desirability and make recommendations on constructing new dams on
the Zambezi river (defined as the part that forms the border between the two states);
(c)   construct, operate, monitor and maintain any other dams on the Zambezi river.
2.8          ZRA's performance has been hampered by limited management and technical skills.
Consultants have recently prepared an Institutional Strengthening Program for which financial
assistance is being sought. ZRA's efforts to manage the use of Lake Kariba's waters have been
further handicapped by periodically poor cooperation between the two governments and national
power utilities that must agree on and put ZRA's policy into practice. Intergovernmental and utility
relations now show evidence of improvement which, if sustained, will lead to more efficient water
use planning and operation of the hydro-power stations.
Power Generation Faciiies
2.9          ZESA's total installed power generating capacity is 1961 MW, comprising 666 MW
(34%) of hydro capacity at Kariba South and 1295 MW (66%) of coal-fired steam power plants
(Table 2.1 and Annex 2.1). Some 110 MW of privately-owned thermal plants are run by two sugar



- 13 -
estates (Triangle, 45 MW; Hippo Valley Estates, 23 MW), by the Wankie Colliery Company (27
MW), and several industries (ZISCO, Express Nickel, Lomagundi Smelting, total 15 MW). Triangle
sells small quantities of surplus power to the grid during the cane processing season.
2.10         The Kariba hydroelectric complex on the Zambezi river consists of two power
stations, one on the south bank, (Kariba South in Zimbabwe), with 6x1 11 MW sets commissioned
between 1959 and 1962, and the other on the north bank, (Kariba North in Zambia), with 4x150 MW
sets commissioned between 1976 and 1977. The combined energy output from both stations is shared
equally between the two countries.

I/ ZESA's Kariba entitlement, which is 50% of the power generated by the Kariba complex.
2.11         The largest thermal generating station in Zimbabwe is the coal-fired mine-mouth plant
at Hwange, comprising 4x120 MW and 2x220 MW units for a total nameplate capacity of 920 MW.
The sent-out capability of each unit is approximately 95% of nameplate, at 114 MW and 209 MW
respectively, giving a maximum total capacity of 874 MW sent out. The three other coal-fired
thermal plants, known as the "Old Thermals," are at Munyati (120 MW), Harare (135 MW) and
Bulawayo (120 MW). The major sources of electricity for Zimbabwe in FY92 were: Hwange
Thermal Power Station (4,310 GWh/42 %), the Kariba Complex (3,161 GWh/31 %), the Old Thermal
Stations (766 GWh/7%) and imports from Zambia (2,038 GWh/20%).
2.12         Neighboring Zambia has major hydro-generation plants at Kafue Gorge (900 MW),
Kariba North (600 MW) and Victoria Falls (108 MW). These three plants constitute 90% of the
installed capacity on the Zambian power system, which is connected to the Zimbabwe network at
Kariba through a strong synchronous tie at 330 kV and to the Zairian power system at 220 kV. In
most years, Zimbabwe has imported significant quantities of power from Zambia and relied on



- 14 -
Zambia for peaking capacity and system reserve. However, the imports were interrupted in 1990, due
to a serious fire at Kafue Gorge Power Station, and again in 1992 due to the drought. Over the past
year, they have been supplemented by up to 100 MW of imports from Zaire, wheeled through
Zambia.
Condton and Techninal Perfornance of the Generatng Facilites
2.13         The Ka,iba South hydropower station is in very good operating condition and
consistently achieves an availability factor of over 95%. An ongoing refurbishment will ensure that
this performance is sustained. The three 'Old Thenmal' power stations at Bulawayo, Harare and
Munyati have been in service for over 40 years and are approaching the end of their useful lives.
Most of the units have not been overhauled for more than 20 years, largely due to the shortage of
foreign exchange. In 1991/92, their availability averaged only 46%. Over the next two to three years,
achieving a higher level of availability is essential to minimize the power shortage. Based on an
ESMAP technical assistance report that was reviewed and agreed with the Bank, ZESA has contracted
for a fast-track and modestly-sized rehabilitation program costing US$32 million to be completed in
early 1994. This will refurbish 90 MW of capacity, one unit at a time, and ensure that these units
achieve 65% availability over the final few years of their life, and particularly during the critical
period 1994-96.
Hwange Power Station
2.14         The 920 MW Hwange Power Staton, the main focus of this project, is the largest
generating station on the system. It is a pulverized coal-fueled steam plant, Stage I of which (4x120
MW) was commissioned in the early 1980s and Stage II (2x220 MW) in 1986/87. Construction of
Stage I commenced in 1973, was suspended in 1975 following the Unilateral Declaration of
Independence, and resumed in 1980. Consequently, it is based on late-1960s technology. Some of
the equipment, such as the boiler controls, is now technically obsolete and difficult or impossible to
repair, because spares cannot be obtained. Stage II, which was financed under the Power I Project,
is of more modern design, but the machines and equipment were supplied by a large number of
different manufacturers and to a variety of specifications, not all compatible or appropriate to the
relatively harsh coal and climatic conditions and to operation in Zimbabwe. Cost-saving economies,
particularly in the undersized cooling water system have reduced the station's effective capacity to
only 750 MW, 85% of nameplate, in the hot season. Its availability has been reduced by rapid wear
of the coal mills, due to the high and variable ash content of the coal; by persistent boiler tube leaks;
by inadequate feed water systems; and by malfunctioning boiler drum level and fuel oil burner
controls on the Stage I units. These technical problems have been compounded by limited engineering
skills and operator experience in Zimbabwe, relative to those required to operate a large, coal-fired
power station; by a persistent shortage of foreign exchange for maintenance, equipment upgrades and
spares; and by bureaucratic delays in the issue of work permits and in customs clearance. Despite
these problems, the station has never failed to achieve at least 75% of its maximum design output and
in three of the past five years has achieved over 85%, in part due to assistance from the Bank.
2.15         Funding was provided from the Power I loan to rehabilitate some of the problem
equipment. The Stage I coal mills were retrofitted with more wear-resistant materials, and foreign
exchange provided for major overhauls of the Stage I boilers and turbines and the provision of some



- 15 -
critical spares. Power II has financed operations advisers to assist and train station staff, upgrade of
the auxiliary water treatment system, major overhaul services and technical assistance from equipment
suppliers on an as-needed basis. Currently, the EDRMP is funding overhaul parts and spares through
the end of 1993. Spares availability has been improved through the supply of foreign exchange, but
inadequate stores facilities and systems have hampered efficient spares procurement and utilization.
New stores facilities have recently been established to improve physical storage of spares and ZESA
has employed a stores specialist to help computerize stock records and institute a fully satisfactory
stores management system. This system will be in operation before any parts to be financed by the
proposed loan are delivered.
2.16          Hwange's year-to-year plant availability factors in recent years are shown in Chart
1 below. In Zimbabwean conditions, a realistic average availability target for Hwange is 80%. For
comparison, the average availability target for a coal-fired power station of similar size in Europe or
the United States would be around 83%. As the chart shows, Hwange achieved first-World
availability in three of the last five years, but fell short of the 80% target in the other two years.
Diagnosis of the shortfalls shows that they were due to a combination of continuing design
weaknesses and to one major equipment failure in each of those two years, partially caused by
operator errors. In 1988/89, a generator transformer was badly damaged, due to an operator error,
and the associated generating unit was out of service for most of the year. In 1991/92, one

of two boilers serving the large Stage II generators exploded and required substantial repair, putting
one of the 220 MW generating units out of service for six months. Overall, Hwange's performance
has been acceptable and the program of IBRD assistance has been producing results. But to sustain
and further improve that performance, the program of expert operations support and training, and
the provision of overhaul and maintenance services needs to be continued and strengthened, spares
provision, storage and use further improved, and investments made to upgrade the remaining problem
equipment that it is economic to replace. These are the steps that the project will support.
2.17         Funding to help sustain and improve Hwange's performance is currently in place
through end-1993, when the Power II and EDRMP loans will close. Within three to four years,
assuming the ESAP reforms stimulate exports and ZESA has been able to fully commercialize its
operations, ZESA should have the human and financial resources and adequate access to the foreign
exchange it routinely requires for the operation of Hwange and other parts of the power system. In
the interim, this loan will supplement ZESA's and Zimbabwe's currently limited sources of foreign
exchange and ensure adequate finance is available for and directed to the comprehensive maintenance,
overhaul and upgrade program required for Hwange Power Station. In so doing, it will: (a) increase
Hwange's output and reliability over the next two to three critical years when Zimbabwe will be short
of power due to the drought; and (b) improve the station's long-term operating characteristics and
performance so that efficient use can be made of this costly and valuable asset.
2.18         The Hwange performance program to be supported by the project was developed by
ZESA, with the help of experts and consulting engineers familiar with the power station whose
services were funded from the Power II project. It was reviewed by the Bank to ensure that the
various components are technically and economically justified, constitute an integrated and
comprehensive program that reflects the lessons of experience, and are sufficient to achieve the
station's output and reliability targets.
2.19         The program, which is summarized in Chapter 3 and described fully in Annex 3.1,
consists of: (a) a small team of senior expatriate power station engineers with extensive thermal
power station experience and familiarity with Zimbabwean conditions who will advise the senior
ZESA plant engineers on critical aspects of plant operation and maintenance, train their technically-
competent but still relatively inexperienced Zimbabwean counterparts and help improve and better
document station operating procedures; (b) equipment suppliers' expert services to assist the ZESA
engineers with major maintenance, statutory overhauls and emergency repairs on an as-needed basis;
(c) essential consumable materials and spares; and (d) a selective upgrade program that is designed
to eliminate the most serious remaining technical problems in the station's design that are economic
to rectify over the next three years. An experienced expatriate adviser to the Station Manager was
appointed in mid-1992, and is partially responsible for the significant improvement in Hwange's
performance that has occurred in the last 12 months. Three other key expatriate advisers - the
Maintenance Adviser, Production Adviser and Stores Adviser - funded initially from the Power II
loan, were appointed in August, 1993.
2.20         The minimum availability targets for Hwange that the project is designed to achieve,
and against which its results will be assessed, are outlined in Table 2.2.

Availability (%)    80       81        83         83
2.21         At the conclusion of the project, the staff of Hwange Power Station should be
sufficiently experienced and well-trained to manage it without full-time expatriate assistance. Also,
the loss of trained engineering staff will have been arrested by the improved conditions of
employment that ZESA will be able to offer to skilled workers following its commercialization.
Assuming the Economic Reform Program has liberalized and increased the supply of foreign
exchange as intended, ZESA should be able to purchase the foreign exchange it requires for regular
maintenance of and material inputs for the power system and should need to borrow internationally
only for major capital investments in system upgrades and/or expansion. The Hwange Power Station
component of the project should therefore result in a sustainable improvement in the performance of
this costly and strategic power facility.
Thsmission Faciies
2.22         The backbone of the country's power transmission system comprises 3444 km of 330
kV lines connecting the major generating stations at Kariba and Hwange to the major load centers
through step-down substations at Alaska, Norton, Warren (near Harare), Sherwood, Bulawayo and
Orange Grove (Annex 2.2). Feeders, nearly all radial, operating at 132 kV, 88 kV and 66 kV,
constitute the remainder of the interconnected grid.
2.23         Much of the 330 kV transmission system has been in service since the 1950s and
1960s. Although technical losses are within acceptable limits, (about 3 % of generation) outages are
relatively frequent and sometimes sustained for long periods. Failure and mal-operation of the
switching and protection equipment, mainly due to age or lack of maintenance, has become a
concern. To alleviate these problems, the Power II Systems Studies recommended construction of
some new 330/132 kV substations and the upgrading of many 88 kV and 132 kV substations. The
African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank and FINNIDA are financing a co-
ordinated program of transmission and primary distribution reinforcement and extension projects
based on the study findings to improve the system's capacity and reliability. ZESA has also recently
signed a contract to upgrade its inadequate National Control Center.
Interconnections with Other Counties
2.24         Apart from the 330 kV Zimbabwe-Zambia link at Kariba, which also allows
Zimbabwe to tap into the Zaire system through Zambia at 220 kV, an 11 kV link with Zambia exists
at Chirundu, north of the Kariba complex. There is also a stand-by facility for a 20 MW import at
Victoria Falls through 33 kV lines for emergency purposes. In eastern Zimbabwe, a 110 kV link at



- 18 -
Mutare can supply up to 40 MW of emergency power from the Mozambique central region system.
The possibility of upgrading this link to cater for a larger transfer (up to 100 MW) is being studied.
2.25         A 33 kV interconnection with South Africa, formerly used to supply the border area
near Beitbridge, has recently been uprated to 132 kV to permit increased imports from the South
African grid. A 220 kV line interconnects Zimbabwe and Botswana, and exports up to 100 MW
from Zambia through Zimbabwe to Botswana when surplus power is available on the Zambian
system. Unfortunately, due to system stability problems, this line cannot be used to reverse the flow
of power to relieve the current shortage situation in Zimbabwe.
DistWbution Facilies
2.26         ZESA's primary distribution voltage is 33 kV, with a route length of 7000 km and
total transformer capacity of 1250 MVA. This is stepped down mainly to 11 kV for local distribution
and to 0.4 kV for supply to consumers' premises. The 11 kV network totals 27,750 km and the 400
volt network 11,868 km. (Annex 2.2). The installed capacity of the 11 kV/0.4 kV transformers is
not available. ZESA has agreed to compile this important indicator and update the mapping of and
carry out a technical audit on the condition of the distribution network. ZESA will also complete a
distribution system expansion study by December 1995, complementing the master plans for
generation and transmission systems.
Losses and Outages
2.27         Total losses on the transmission and distribution systems have averaged just under
10% of energy sent out during the last five years (Annex 1.2). This is low for Africa and an
acceptable level, considering the extent of the two systems. It confirms that the distribution system,
accounting for almost two thirds of the total length of the transmission and distribution network, is
well designed, following British standards and practices. It also demonstrates the benefits of the live-
line training programs that ZESA has instituted for its transmission and distribution engineers.
Planned outages on the transmission system are nevertheless on the high side (Annex 2.2).
Corresponding information for planned and unplanned outages on the distribution network is not
available, but ZESA has reported a rising trend in the number of outages. These are bound to grow
with the expansion of the system, but are exacerbated by shortages of foreign exchange for
maintenance and reinforcement. Analysis of loss reduction and reinforcement options shows that
installing additional capacity at key points in the distribution system is economic. The proposed
project therefore provides materials and equipment for selective distribution network reinforcement.
2.28         ZESA is constructing mechanical and electrical workshop facilities to improve its
distribution system repair capacity. To ensure that effective use is made of these facilities, the project
will finance the procurement of key items of workshop equipment. ZESA also operates a vehicle fleet
of over 1700 units, the bulk of which are devoted to distribution system maintenance and repair. A
Transport Management Study has recently been completed by expert consultants funded under Power
II. It recommended the installation of a modern computerized fleet management system,
standardization of vehicle types and the procurement of a substantial number of vehicles to replace
those units that are well beyond their economic life. ZESA has accepted these recommendations and
retained the planning consultants to design and install the new fleet management system. The project



- 19 -
will finance the procurement of some of the specialist vehicles recommended by the consultants to
improve distribution maintenance.
Demand MAnagement Capabity
2.29         ZESA's principal tool for demand management is its tariff, which is appropriately
structured with demand and energy charge. For peak demand management, ZESA has negotiated
interruptible tariffs with several of its large consumers and can disconnect about 30 MW of domestic
water heating load in Harare at peak through use of a ripple control system. The latter is a highly
economic demand management tool, which the project will extend to the other major towns and
expand to cover about 60 MW of water heating load. In addition, technical auditing of the existing
ripple control system will be carried out and needed refurbishment and upgrading will be undertaken
under the project.
2.30         ZESA currently lacks an automatic mechanism to shed large segments of load from
the power system in the event of a major supply shortfall. Such a mechanism can prevent a supply
failure shutting down the entire power system, as occurred on two occasions in late 1992. The
project will eliminate this system control weakness by installing automatic below-frequency load
shedding equipment that will progressively shed load at a time of supply shortfall and balance the
system at the reduced level of supply with a minimum of disconnections (Annex 3.1, para. 13).
Access to Serice and Rur4l Ekctnfladon
2.31         The public power system supplies electricity to about 320,000 customers in
Zimbabwe. Approximately 20% of households are connected to the system. High-density housing
areas are given priority for new connections, followed by schools, commercial business and rural
growth points. Given the shortage of supply, very few new consumers will be connected to the
system over the next three years. Thereafter, the pace of electrification will be groomed by the need
for cost-recovery.
2.32         The dispersion and low incomes of the rural population renders rural electrification
an expensive, often non-viable and hence a slow process. The Government launched a Rural
Electrification Program in 1985 which envisaged the provision of electricity to 24 'growth points'.
A budget of Z$3 million was allocated from ZESA's own financial resources for Phase I of this
work. By the end of 1986, a further 48 growth centers had been identified and Z$8 million set aside
(from ZESA's own resources) for their electrification in Phase II.
2.33         All the 24 growth centers in Phase I now have supply, but only 13 of the 48 Phase
II centers are connected. Progress has been slowed by rising costs of imported materials and
additional scope of work in some centers, created by the build-up of demand during construction.
Shortages of foreign exchange have also contributed to the slow down of the Phase II works. An
updated Rural Electrification Plan has been prepared, with technical assistance from GTZ, to identify
the most economic sites for further grid extensions. Consistent with its policy of commercializing
ZESA and to avoid the risk that future rural electrification projects will weaken ZESA's financial
performance, the Government has agreed to subsidize any financially non-viable grid extensions that,
for social reasons, it instructs ZESA to construct and operate.

ZESA's Staing and Overail fficiency
2.34         The integration of six separate power entities into ZESA was achieved without any
major delay or decline in the reliability of the power system. ZESA now has a total of 7,500
employees, roughly one for every 42 consumers. This ratio is much higher than developed country
standards, but about half that of the utilities in neighboring Malawi and Zambia.
2.35         ZESA's management recognizes that there is considerable scope for further efficiency
improvement. Consequently, it has arranged for an independent performance diagnostic study, based
on Terms of Reference developed jointly with the Bank (Annex 2.3) to be conducted in 1993 and
1994. The study will outline a comprehensive and integrated program of actions needed for ZESA
to operate efficiently and on commercial lines. It is being done in two phases, a first, overview phase
was completed in September 1993, and a second, in-depth phase, to be completed by mid-1994. The
first phase outlined a program of immediate measures to improve efficiency and set related
performance targets for FY93/94, to which ZESA has committed in its FY93/94 Operations Plan.
The second phase will identify the longer-term steps needed to improve efficiency, and note any legal
and regulatory changes required by Government in parallel, and will recommend appropriate
performance targets for FY94/95, to be incorporated into an updated Operations Plan for that year.
Staff Development wad Trnaing
2.36         ZESA has an active and comprehensive staff development and training prograrn which
is implemented by its Area Offices and power stations and coordinated by a Training Section at Head
Office. Training is organized into four categories: (1) routine basic training (apprentice and post-
graduate); (2) advancement and reinforcement training (advanced technical and supervisory skills);
(3) new technologies (advanced engineering, total quality management); and (4) targeted training
(live-line working, AIDS awareness, etc.). Routine training programs are derived from the annual
Manpower Plan and standards approved by the Ministry of Higher Education or the relevant
professional bodies. Advancement training is planned on an individual basis from performance
appraisals or skills analysis. New technologies training is initiated by the managers responsible for
the technology and often integrated with equipment installation. Targeted training is generally initiated
by the Training Section in consultation with senior management.
2.37         ZESA has adequate and well-equipped training facilities. It has a large training center
in Harare, and smaller training centers in Bulawayo and Hwange. The Harare Training Center
provides pre-apprenticeship courses for a duration of 12 weeks for up to 300 staff each year, and
apprenticeship courses for 6 months in distribution engineering, power generation and transmission.
The Center is equipped with electrical and mechanical workshops, a welding shop, a laboratory and
a training simulator for steam power plant operators funded under the Power I Project. The Harare
Training Center is capable of catering for the training needs of neighboring countries as well as
Zimbabwe. The Hwange Training Center provides a comprehensive program of courses in power
station operations and maintenance and the Bulawayo Center specializes in transmission and
distribution system training. A total of 410 staff were in full-time technical training in June 1992.



- 21 -
2.38         ZESA also provides overseas post-graduate training opportunities for its staff.
Priority in this form of training is given to technical areas, due to the present shortage of engineering
skills and the past dependency on expatriates. Trainees are bonded to ZESA for a period equivalent
to the period of training. Seventy-one staff were in full-time post-graduate training in mid-1992.
ZESA also sponsors staff to attend the University of Zimbabwe and several local colleges for training
in mechanical and electrical engineering disciplines. In addition, ZESA sends staff regularly on
various courses, seminars and workshops, both locally and overseas. A series of courses at middle
management, junior management and supervisor levels are arranged from time to time, run by the
Zimbabwe Institute of Management. Overall, ZESA's training activities are comprehensive, well
organized and effectively conducted. The major constraint has been the availability of foreign
exchange, particularly to finance specialist training overseas and foreign instructor visits to
Zimbabwe. The Bank has helped to finance both these needs under the Power I and Power II
Projects and this project will continue Bank support to those parts of the training program requiring
foreign exchange.
Management Information System
2.39          ZESA's operating efficiency will be enhanced by the completion, under this project,
of a comprehensive, computerized Management Information System (MIS), the installation of which
is well underway with funding from Power II. Most of the computer hardware has been installed,
the software selected and tailored to ZESA's needs, and installation of the financial systems is nearly
complete. This project will finance design of information systems for each of the thermal power
stations and their integration into the overall MIS and modernize cash receipting from load limited
consumers in Harare, Bulawayo and Chitungwiza.
Accounting and Aumt
2.40         The responsibility for accounting and financial functions, which will soon be fully
computerized as part of the MIS project, is vested in the Finance Department, which is headed by
a Finance Director. The department is adequately manned for its present level of operations, but
suffers from excessive staff turnover. This should be alleviated with the recent granting of greater
salary autonomy to ZESA by the Government.
2.41          ZESA has an internal audit unit which reports directly to the General Manager. The
functions of the unit are carried out effectively. An independent private audit firm appointed by the
Board verifies ZESA's financial statements, as agreed under the Power 11 Project. ZESA also agreed
under that project to have certified financial statements sent to the Bank within six months of the close
of each fiscal year. The audited accounts for FY92 have been received. During negotiations, it was
agreed that ZESA will continue to have its accounts audited by an external auditor acceptable to the
Bank and send its audited financial statements to the Bank within six months of the close of each
fiscal year.

Bilig and Col1ection
2.42         Prior to the formation of ZESA, billing and collection were the responsibility of the
respective separate electricity undertakings, i.e., ESC and the four municipal electricity departments.
Following amalgamation in 1987, billing and collection in the municipalities of Bulawayo, Mutare
and Gweru have been taken over by ZESA. Billing and collection in Harare are still handled by the
municipality, because it has well-developed computer facilities which ZESA is still to acquire through
its new MIS. There is an agreement between ZESA and the municipality for it to act as agent to
ZESA until ZESA has its own billing and collection system fully in operation and is able to efficiently
absorb these functions.
2.43         As a condition of the Power II loan, ZESA reports quarterly to the Bank on the status
of its billing and collection efforts. Until FY91/92, collection performance was satisfactory, total
outstanding receivables being equivalent to about two months of sales. This was close to the target
of 60 days agreed with the Bank as a condition of the Power II loan. However, due to the difficult
economic situation and ZESA's late settlement of some of its own accounts, accounts receivable rose
to 85 days of sales in 1991/92. ZESA has since implemented a more aggressive collection program,
and the backlog is falling. Under this project, ZESA has agreed to report to the Bank the status of
its billings and collections as of December 31 and June 30 each year and not allow its outstanding
customer accounts to exceed 75 days of revenues in FY94 and FY95, 65 days in FY96 and 60 days
of revenues in FY97.
Insurances wad Taxes
2.44         ZESA maintains insurance coverage on all assets, stores and inventories and on
vehicles, as well as for liability to third parties. The insurance coverage is in accordance with normal
power utility practice and includes insurance for boiler explosion at the generating stations. The
insurance cover is reviewed periodically by the Bank to assure its continuing adequacy and is
currently satisfactory. ZESA does not pay income or corporation tax, but is liable for customs duties
on imported vehicles and some materials and equipment. These exemptions are not consistent with
commercial practice, and are being reassessed in the Government's parastatal reform study with a
view to their elimination.
Demd Forecas
2.45         Consumption of electric power rose by an average of 3 % per year over the five years
prior to the 1992 drought, about the same rate as GDP and close to the 3.3% growth forecast in
ZESA's 1988 System Development Plan. Using the econometric forecasting model developed for
the plan, and taking account of the current supply constraint, ZESA and the Bank have prepared an
updated demand forecast that is summarized in Table 2.3 for the period up to FY98 (with FY92
actuals for reference) and presented in full in Annex 2.4.

ZESA Electricity Demand Forecast. FY1993-98
FISCAL              SALES         DEMAND
YEAR               (GWH)             (MW)
1991/92(a)           9,248            1,458
1992/93              8,118            1,416
1993/94              8,629            1,634
1994/95              9,173            1,770
1995/96              9,906            1,821
1996/97             10,402            1,878
1997/98             10,818            1,942
2.46         For the first three years of the forecast period, FY93-95, sales will be constrained
by a combination of reduced demand and shortage of supply due to the drought. In early 1996, it
is assumed that at least one of the high voltage interconnectors that Zimbabwe plans to install with
neighboring Mozambique and South Africa will be commissioned and the supply constraint fully
alleviated. Until this year, consumption is not forecast to exceed the FY92 actual level. Meanwhile,
economic growth is projected to resume in 1993, as the economy recovers from the drought, and to
average over 5% in real terms during the mid-1990s as the benefits of the Structural Adjustment
Program feed through. Historically, the elasticity of electricity demand to GDP is 1.08, which would
suggest that power demand growth will also be in the 5% range. There is also considerable
suppressed demand due to past under-investment in the distribution system that is progressively being
eliminated by distribution investments financed under this and other projects. However, tariffs were
increased substantially in real terms in 1992 and are projected to rise further as ZESA introduces full
commercial and economic prices during 1993, 1994 and 1995. These real tariff increases are expected
to shake out some uneconomic consumption and to restrain demand growth. Electricity demand is
therefore forecast to rise more slowly than GDP at an average rate of 4% per year after 1996.
Power System Development
2.47         ZESA and the Government's reliability target for power system development planning
is a Loss of Load Probability of 20 hours per year, which is considered appropriate. The recently-
revised power development program that was developed with the help of ESMAP and the Bank
following the drought is based on this target and consists of the following major committed projects:
(i) rehabiliation of the three Old Ihermal power stations, costing about US$32
million, to be completed in early 1994. The rehabilitation program is designed to increase
the output of those stations over the next three years until a major new source of power
supply is available and allow them to provide reserve and limited peaking capacity for
another ten years, before their retirement in about 2003; and



- 24 -
(ii) construction of two high voltage (400 kV) intenatonal tranm ioan ines,
one to link the Zimbabwe power system to the Cahora Bassa Power Station in
Mozambique, which currently has 2000 MW of surplus hydro-generating capacity, the
other to interconnect through Botswana with the South African power system, which has
substantial excess thermal capacity, at the Matimba Power Station in Northern Transvaal.
2.48      Before finalizing the Old Thermals Rehabilitation Project, ZESA and the Government
sought the advice of the Bank and technical assistance from ESMAP to ensure that the final project
scope and implementation schedule were tailored to the current power supply and demand situation.
This analysis concluded that a substantial reduction should be made in the original scope of the
Rehabilitation Project and its implementation schedule revised to increase firm supply from the Old
Thermal stations during the power shortage. These conclusions were accepted by the ZESA and the
Government and the revised project is now being implemented.
2.49      The decision to construct the two high voltage transmission lines to Mozambique and
South Africa was taken after a review of alternative options for both alleviating the current shortage
of electric energy and meeting future power demand. Given the existence of excess generating
capacity in the region and the short lead time and lower capital cost of transmission facilities,
interconnection rather than the construction of new generating capacity was clearly the optimal
strategy. The choice was between two technically-equivalent solutions: Option 1, a double circuit line
to the Cahora Bassa Power Station in Mozambique; and Option 2, two single circuit lines, one to
Cahora Bassa, the other to the South African power system at the Matimba Power Station in Northern
Transvaal. To compare the economic cost of these two options, an estimate of the economic cost of
meeting power demand over the period up to 2005 was made for each alternative. The same
subsequent supply project was assumed to be implemented in both cases - extension of Hwange Power
Station by a further two units (the Hwange III Project), which is the project that ZESA's planners
have provisionally concluded to be the next least-cost. The analysis, which is summarized in Annex
2.5, confirmed that Option 2, the twin single line alternative selected by ZESA, is the lower cost of
the two options by Z$427 million in 1992 prices. Annex 2.6 show3 the projected system capacity
and energy balances with the selected option, rehabilitation of the Old Thermals and this project.
2.50      In addition to being the most economic option for alleviating the power shortage, the two
new international transmission lines will significantly expand the interconnected southern Africa
power grid. Following their completion, the power systems of Zimbabwe, Zambia, Zaire,
Mozambique, Botswana and South Africa will be connected at a voltage of 220kV or higher. This
development offers tremendous long-term prospects for the sharing of reserve capacity, trade in
surplus energy and ultimately for the joint development of power generation projects. The regional
benefits of such coordinated power system operation and development over the next 18 years alone
are conservatively estimated by the recent ESMAP-managed SADC Power Interconnection Study to
exceed US$1.5 billion in 1992 prices, a saving of about 15% of incremental power supply costs.
2.51      In addition to completing the above two new investment projects, the third priority
element of ZESA's power supply strategy is to maximize the availability and, in the short-term, the
output of Hwange Power Station. This is particularly critical over the next two to three years until
the first of the high voltage interconnectors is in place. As outlined earlier, Hwange's performance,
while better than that of many coal-fired power stations in other developing countries, has not been



- 25 -
as good as a station of its design and vintage is capable of. Achieving maximum performance will
require more professional station management, an adequate supply of spare parts, timely maintenance
and the elimination of design weaknesses that can be rectified relatively quickly and economically.
The major objective of this project is achieve this improvement in Hwange's performance in order
to maximize its output over the 1994-96 period and raise its reliability in the longer term by
providing these critical inputs. The project will raise Hwange's effective capacity from a low of 736
MW in the hot season to 836 MW and ensure that it is capable of producing at least 5,000
GWh/year.
2.52      A transmission network analysis study completed under the Power 11 project is the basis
for the domestic components of ZESA's planned transmission investment program. The study
confirmed the economic and technical justification for the Tokwe-Triangle 330 kV line, which is now
nearly complete. The other major weakness identified in the transmission system is in the area to the
north and east of Harare. A new 330 kV line from Alaska to Mutorashanga and a 132 kV line from
Mutorashanga to Bindura is the recommended solution, and has been incorporated into ZESA's
investment program. This line will form part of an eventual 330 kV ring around the city, and will
provide an alternative routing for the proposed supply from Cahora Bassa, which will feed into the
Bindura substation.
2.53      The 132 kV, 88 kV and 66 kV transmission systems require selective reinforcement over
the next five years, particularly in the Midlands and Bulawayo areas. Projects funded by the AfDB,
EIB, FINNIDA and Switzerland will cover the highest priority needs. Investment is also required
in the low voltage distribution system to reduce losses and serve new and growing loads in the longer
term. This and an AfDB project will meet the most urgent and economically-justified of these needs.
ZESA Tve-year Investment Progrwn
2.54       The resources required to implement ZESA's FY93-98 investment program, which
includes all the above projects, total Z$8,191 million (US$1,054 million) in current prices, excluding
interest during construction, of which Z$4,085 million (50%) is in foreign exchange. The program
is large and a considerable technical, managerial and financial challenge to the Authority. However,
it is needed both to compensate for past under-investment and to ensure that adequate power is
available in future to support economic growth and development. A summary of the investment
program is presented in Annex 2.7.
2.55      To allow the Bank to continue to assist in the process of power system investment
planning and help identify least-cost solutions, ZESA has agreed that it will continue to consult
annually with Government and the Bank on its power investment program for the next three
successive fiscal years. Following these consultations, ZESA has agreed to adopt an investment
program satisfactory to the Government and the Bank and not to implement any power investment
project costing in excess of US$50 million not in the agreed investment program without prior
consultation with the Bank.

HI. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
3.1          The short term objectives of the proposed project are to assist ZESA to: (i) minimize
the shortage of power by improving the reliability and the performance of the Hwange power plant;
(ii) increase the efficiency of the distribution system through loss reduction measures, thereby
satisfying unmet demand; and (iii) better manage the power shortage through discriminative load
shedding measures. Over the longer term, the project will facilitate the commercialization of ZESA
and help ZESA build sustainable technical capability, which will lead to more efficient operation and
planning of the power system.
Project Preparaqon
3.2          A Bank preparation mission visited Zimbabwe in November 1992 and agreed with
the Government on the main components of the proposed project, after detailed discussions with
ZESA. These emphasized the operation and upkeep of Hwange power plant, economic loss reduction
measures for the distribution network and priority maintenance equipment and special duty vehicles.
The detailed project description, the timing of its implementation and the project costs and financing
plan were discussed with ZESA and the Government at appraisal in March 1993, and reviewed and
agreed upon at negotiations.
Project Description
3.3          A detailed description of the proposed project is given in Annex 3.1 and is
summarized below. The project consists of:
A.    Distribution Rejaforcement
(i)    The distribution network subcomponent has the main objective of loss reduction
(estimated at 7MW peak) and the subsidiary objective of providing for unmet demand
when supply becomes available. It includes the following: installation of about 53
MVA of 33/11 kV distribution and 30MVA of 132/llkV substation transformer
capacity, complete with switchgear and control equipment; construction of 50km of
132kV line, reinforcement of about 100km of 33kV and 75km of 1 lkV distribution
lines; and installation of 7.5MVAr capacitors.
(ii)   Installation of ripple control devices and under frequency relays for peak demand
management and load shedding, including provision for needed upgrading of existing
ripple control equipment.



- 27 -
B.    Hwange Operatons and Upgrade
Improving the reliability and sustaining the performance of Hwange power plant will
be achieved through:
(i)   institutional technical assistance of 310 man-months to help in power plant
management and operations, including technical auditing, to further
strengthen indigenous capability initiated under Power I & II loans and
ensure sustainability in managing the operation and maintenance of Hwange
power plant by ZESA through transfer of know-how and job-oriented
training;
(ii)   the acquisition of materials and spares needed to operate the power plant;
(iii)  the provision of about 200 man-months for proprietary maintenance service
contracts;
(iv)   the provision of services and equipment for major overhaul of 5 of the 6
Stage I & Stage II units; and
(v)    upgrading the capacity of the cooling water system, a major constraint in
Hwange's operations, including the construction of an additional cooling
tower and improving cooling water quality through the provision of
additional circulating water pumps, prevention of ingress of debris,
minimizing silting presently infiltrating the cooling towers and the cooling
system; installing a closed auxiliary cooling system for bearings and other
equipment through the provision of separate pumping and cooling systems;
replacing the outdated pneumatic process control system of the Stage I units
by an electronic system and improving the level of instrumentation to ensure
effective control of the generating units and reliable monitoring of their
performance; refurnishing the air conditioning system of the power station;
and providing additional station transformer, switchgear equipment and
transformers for standby diesel generating sets.
C.    Design of Hwange Stage IH
Consultancy services (substitution technical assistance) to: (i) review and update the design
and the cost estimate and prepare bid and contract documents for the Hwange III extension; and (ii)
prepare a project document incorporating the feasibility of the extension in a manner satisfactory to
the Bank.



- 28 -
D.    Mecanical and Elctricl Workshops
Acquisition of tools, machinery, equipment handling cranes and electrical testing plant and
equipment for the mechanical and electrical workshops.
E   Vdki
Acquisition of heavy duty vehicles and specialized equipment for distribution works, including
pick-ups, 4-wheel drive trucks etc.
F.    Managaent I4fonnaton System (WIS)
(i)    Acquisition of additional computer hardware and software to complete the on-going
MIS project under the Power II loan;
(ii)   Provision for computer-aided cash-receipting facilities for load limited consumers in
Bulawayo (82,000), Harare (18,000) and Chitungwiza (13,800); and
(iii)   Technical assistance to strengthen MIS operations.
G.    Insidional Suppoyt
(i)    Provision for training for ZESA staff and technical personnel; and
(ii)   Provision for studies on issues critical for the operation of ZESA.
Prjedc Cost EUMae
3.4          Project costs are detailed in Annex 3.2 and summarized in Table 3.1 below. The
total cost of the project, including physical and price contingencies but excluding duties and taxes and
interest during construction, is estimated to be US$174.19 million, of which the foreign exchange cost
would be US$134.22 million or 77.1% of the total project cost. The total cost of the project
including interest during construction is estimated to be US$200.27. Base costs are at June 1992
price levels, with physical contingencies of 10% for all project components. Price contingencies are
based on local inflation estimated at 40% in 1992, 30% in 1993, 20% in 1994, 18% in 1995, 15%
in 1996 and 1997. International inflation is estimated at 5% in 1992 through 1997.

3.5            The total financing required, including interest during construction, is US$199.14
million, of which US$134.22 million is in foreign exchange. IBRD will finance 67% (US$90
million) of the foreign exchange costs. It was agreed at appraisal with the Government and ZESA
that the remaining foreign exchange amount of US$44.22 million will be borne by ZESA and sourced
through a combination of Government allocations (code 54), purchases of ERS funds and procurement
through OGIL or other facilities. ZESA will finance the local cost of US$39.13 million in equivalent
local currency and interest during construction, estimated at US$25.79 million. The proposed loan
of US$90 million will be directly to ZESA for a term of 20 years, including 5 years grace, at the
prevailing IBRD interest rate. ZESA would bear the foreign exchange risk on loan repayments.
Table 3.2 summarizes the financing plan for the project.

3.6            ZESA will be responsible for the implementation of all components of the project.
Execution of the project is expected to start in the last quarter of 1993 and to be completed in June
1997. All distribution works, substation expansion and reinforcement, including capacitor bank
installation, will be carried out by ZESA's own work force. Transmission lines, upgrade works and
major overhauling and repair of Hwange generating station will be undertaken by contractors under
the direct supervision of ZESA. Annex 3.3 summarizes the Implementation Schedule of the proposed
project. In order to facilitate timely implementation, agreement was reached at negotiations that
ZESA and the Government Tender Board will complete the bid adjudication and approval process
for all equipment and material procurement in a maximum of three months.
3.7           In order to ensure efficient and timely implementation of the project, agreement was
reached at negotiations that ZESA will appoint an experienced Project Coordinator, with terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank, prior to signature of the loan documents. It was also agreed at
negotiations that the Project Coordinator's role will be to plan and coordinate the activities of the
project managers for each component, to arrange for tendering and equipment deliveries at the
appropriate time, to monitor installation of the equipment, to prepare quarterly progress reports in



- 31 -
accordance with the reporting requirements of the Bank, to update cost estimates, to liaise with the
Bank on Project related activities and to prepare the Project Completion Report. In view of the
volume of procurement (Table 3.3) and the need to ensure quality control of the overhauling and
repair of the Hwange units, ZESA will employ an experienced mechanical engineer (production
adviser), a maintenance adviser and a stores adviser to assist the Power Plant Superintendent in the
detailed implementation of the Hwange component, including the procurement aspects of Hwange
operations. Project managers will also be assigned to follow up the implementation of each major
component (A, B & C, D & E, F & G of para 3.3 above) of the Project.
Disburzsement
3.8          The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed over a period of about 34 months from
March 1994 through June 1997. Disbursement from the loan account will be made for 100% of
foreign expenditures for equipment, materials and consultant services.  In order to expedite
disbursement of funds, a special account in foreign currency, with an initial deposit of US$4 million,
will be opened in a bank acceptable to IBRD. Disbursements will be made on the basis of Statement
of Expenditures (SOE) for contracts below $100,000. Supporting documents thereof will not be
submitted to the Bank for reimbursement of such expenditures, but will be properly filed and kept
by ZESA for verification annually by auditors acceptable to the Bank (para 2.32) and review by Bank
supervision missions. The anticipated schedule of disbursements from the proposed loan, based on
the annual estimated project costs, is given in Annex 3.4 and is consistent with standard profiles for
Bank loans and IDA credits for power projects in the Africa region. Both the Power I and Power
II loans disbursed close to their planned schedule, and a similar good performance is expected for
this project. The closing date for the proposed loan would be December 31, 1997, six months after
project completion.
Procurement
3.9          ZESA's procurement of major items, as with that of all parastatals, is subject to
review by the Government Tender Board (GTB). Tenders are invited through the GTB, and review
and approval procedures must conform to Government instructions. ZESA is familiar with the
Bank's procurement guidelines and standard bidding documents and experience with procurement on
the Power I and Power II projects has been generally good, although the review and approval process
by the GTB can sometimes take time. Government and ZESA's agreement to follow the Bank's
procurement guidelines and to use the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for components financed
by the Bank was obtained during negotiations. During negotiations, the Bank and ZESA also agreed
on the project's Implementation Schedule (Annex 3.3), including a target of three months or less for
the adjudication and bid evaluation approval process. The Implementation Schedule outlines essential
target dates that must be achieved to complete the project on schedule. An Implementation Plan was
discussed at negotiations and agreement was reached to detail at project launch (Annex 3.6) the
various stages of the procurement cycle for each contract package of the individual components of
the Project. It will be noted from the Implementation Schedule that the bid opening for most of the
components of the project is planned for January 1994, soon after the estimated date of declaration
of effectiveness of December 1993 for the proposed loan. To facilitate achievement of this target,
ZESA has prepared the bid documents for the distribution component and is in the process of
preparing the documents for operations support, as well as for procurement of spares and equipment



- 32 -
of Hwange power plant, in line with similar packages under Power II. The tender documents for the
Hwange Upgrade Program are under preparation with the help of consultants. These advance
procurement actions will expedite contract award after the declaration of effectiveness of Power III.
3.10         Procurement of distribution materials, workshop equipment, vehicles and computer
hardware and software (MIS component) will be made through international competitive bidding
(ICB), in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for procurement and in compliance with the relevant
Bank Standard Bidding Documents.  Preference to domestic manufacturers will be given in
accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines. Expert services for Operations Support (para.
18 of Annex 3.1) will be by direct contracting of individual experts with relevant specialized
experience on coal fired power plant operation and maintenance, which experience with Power II has
shown to result in higher quality and more cost-effective services than contracting through a
consulting firm. Consultancy for Hwange Stage III and for studies under the Institutional Support
component (paras. 39 and 45 of Annex 3.1 respectively) will be procured on a competitive basis in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines for the selection of consultants.
3.11  In order to ensure compatibility with existing equipment, the spare parts, materials and
services required for the repair, major overhauling and maintenance of Hwange Power Station (paras.
19 through 21 of Annex 3.1) will be obtained from the original manufacturers through direct
negotiations by ZESA. The aggregate amount of contracts (estimated at a minimum of 11 contract
packages) for the supply and installation of proprietary spares and equipment shall not exceed $29
million equivalent. It will be noted from Table 3.3 that this total is made up of Maintenance Spares
($4.50 million); Maintenance Contracts ($3.57 million); Overhaul Spares ($5.74 million); Overhaul
Services ($13.75 million) and Upgrade Services ($1.45 million). ZESA has successfully negotiated
numerous similar arrangements in the past and keeps good records of prices for essential materials
and services for Hwange. The draft contracts for these proprietary spares and services will be
reviewed by the Bank. The Hwange Upgrade (Annex 3.1, paras 22 through 28) will be procured
through ICB, based on specifications and bid documents under preparation by ZESA's consultants.
The design and the construction of the additional cooling tower (para. 30 of Annex 3.1) will be
funded by ZESA and procured under local competitive bidding in accordance with Standard Bidding
Documents. The training component (about 80% of the amount under institutional, Table 3.3), other
than graduate studies, will be done through direct contracting with power utilities and consultants on
the basis of proposals obtained by ZESA for appropriate courses with which it is familiar. Selection
of universities for graduate studies will be through short listing of institutions agreed with the Bank.
Workshop equipment will be packaged (electrical separate from mechanical, machinery and equipment
separate from tools, etc.) as far as possible to attract appropriate potential suppliers. These packages
as well as procurements of other components will, to the extent possible, be bulked into orders of
not less than US$500,000 and subjected to ICB. For procurements of packages under US$500,000
(up to an aggrega!e amount of US$1 million), no less than three suppliers would be invited to submit
quotations. All contracts for goods estimated to cost over US$500,000 equivalent would be subject
to prior review of bidding and contract documents by the Bank. All contracts exceeding US$100,000
and all terms of references for consultancy services shall be subject to prior review by the Bank.
Procurement advice will also be secured from the consultants and experts involved in the operation
of the Hwange power plant. In addition, ZESA will employ an experienced mechanical engineer to
assist in the preparation of the detailed specification for the Hwange component of the project (para.
3.7). A summary of the procurement methods to be used in the project is given in Table 3.3.

Envirunmental Aspects
3.12         The main component of the project is the refurbishment and upgrading of the existing
generating plant and equipment of the 920MW coal fired power plant at Hwange. With the exception
of the local mine township, Hwange Power Station is in a sparsely populated region of Zimbabwe.
It is equipped with precipitators for dust particle removal from the flue gases, but does not have flue
gas desulpherization. Ash disposal practices were reviewed by the Bank and found to be fully
satisfactory. This review also found no evidence of significant local pollution from the plant. The
project will not increase in the installed capacity of the power plant. However, plant reliability and
performance is expected to improve, which should result in slightly lower specific coal consumption.
The project's distribution component is also mainly reinforcement of the existing system. New
facilities, where they are provided (as in the case of a 50km 132kV line, para 3.3A-i) are
replacements of existing facilities. The project is therefore not expected to have adverse impacts on
the environment during its execution and following its completion. In the medium term, when
additional power becomes available and the unmet demand is catered for, the project will marginally
reduce domestic woodfuel consumption through the provision of access to electricity for domestic
consumers presently awaiting connection to ZESA's distribution network.
P,ject Risk
3.13         Delayed delivery of spare parts and materials for Hwange could result in
postponement of the major overhaul program for some of the units, particularly units 5 and 6 (Annex
3. 1, para. 20). Such a delay could result in more frequent unplanned outages and in unavoidable load
shedding of some industrial and commercial consumers. This risk will be minimized through bid
document preparation and tendering proceeding simultaneously with loan processing, with the aim
of concluding contracts as soon as the loan is declared effective (para. 3.9). There is little physical
risk associated with the distribution component since the distribution works involve increasing the
capacities of existing systems, with a minimum of civil works associated with the activity. Most of
the work is routine in nature, and similar tasks are being carried out successfully by ZESA and its
contractors. The volume of similar activities being undertaken simultaneously by ZESA, and ZESA's
past inability to retain sufficient qualified and experienced technical staff may, however, impede
timely implementation of the project. There is also the possibility of a financial risk, should project
costs exceed the estimates. ZESA and the Government are taking steps to improve ZESA's financial
performance. This will reduce the risk of a possible financial shortfall. In addition, should cost
increases occur, some of the less critical project components are such that the scope of the work or
the volume of deliveries may be marginally decreased to accommodate the funds available with little
detrimental effect upon the achievement of the project's major objectives. There is risk that demand
will grow slower than forecast, particularly if the Government fails to sustain an effective program
of structural adjustment. There is also a risk of interruption to power supply, due to breakdown of
generation or transmission facilities. The risk of generation failure is reduced by the provision of
technical assistance for the maintenance and upgrading of Hwange Power Station. The risk of
transmission failure is reduced by the extension and reinforcement works being financed by AfDB,
EIB and FINNIDA projects. These risks are therefore considered slight.

Project Monitorng and Peifonnance Indcor,
3.14         Records and reports necessary to monitor the progress of the project and the
achievement of its objectives were discussed during project preparation and will be agreed upon
during negotiations. Performance in reinforcement and expansion of the distribution system for each
ZESA region will be monitored separately in accordance with the format given in Annex 2.2.
Supervision missions will monitor relevant information and the performance indicators contained in
Annexes 2.1, 2.2 and 3.5. The number and duration of planned and unplanned interruptions on
ZESA's transmission and distribution systems will also be monitored. The detailed reporting
requirements will be explained during a Project Launch Workshop (Annex 3.6) to be held soon after
the declaration of effectiveness of the project. Preparation of a Project Completion Report not later
than six months after project completion was agreed upon during negotiations.
3.15     A mechanism for beneficiary assessment during project design and implementation has
been established. This involves regular consultative meetings between the Bank, ZESA and the
Power Committee of the Zimbabwe Association of Business Organizations (ZABO). ZABO members
account for about 80% of power consumption in Zimbabwe. The Power Committee has been briefed
on the project objectives and content and consulted on the power policy reforms being supported by
the project. Bank supervision missions will, when necessary, liaise with the Committee to obtain
their feedback on project progress and sector reform.
Superuon
3.16         The project will require relatively intensive supervision in the first year for the project
launch and to review tender documents and adjudication reports for the major equipment and
materials purchases (see para. 3.10). Supervision in the second and third years will be less intensive,
but will require visits to Zimbabwe about twice a year to assess physical progress and determine
whether the project is on track with regard to its development objectives and compliance with legal
covenants. An interim review will be held in mid 1994 to assess progress with the power policy
reform program and agree the content of the FY95 ZESA Operations Plan. A midterm review late
in mid 1995 will be carried out to assess progress and the need for redesign of some of the
components of the project. A Supervision Plan is outlined in Annex 3.6.

4.2            The operating performance of ZESA has improved in Zimbabwe dollar terms over
the past three years, during which inflation has doubled to about 30% in the last fiscal year and the
Zimbabwe dollar depreciated by nearly 60%. However, the performance measured in terms of return
on partly revalued assets has been inadequate throughout this period, registering only 15.2% in
1991/92. The real rate of return would be considerably less on a fully revalued basis due to the
significant local inflation and devaluations in the recent past.
4.3            Electricity sales increased by a modest 2.6%  in 1991/92, 6% below the forecast for
the year. The anticipated levels of sales were not realized due to 64 days of load shedding, as a
result of: (a) the severe drought affecting hydro generation; and (b) the interruption caused in
switching electricity imports from Zambia to Zaire in April 1992. In order to meet the shortfall in
revenue as a result of lower volumes, and to meet increased operating costs and debt service
requirements due to high local inflation and devaluation of the Zimbabwe dollar, electricity tariffs
were increased by an average of 15.5% in July 1991, December 1991 and May 1992. This average
tariff in 1991/92 increased by 38.1 % over the previous year. Heavier reliance on electricity imports
and higher payroll and plant maintenance costs contributed to the bulk of the increase in total
operating costs in the last year.

4.4             After providing for interest, and based on a new  foreign exchange accounting
procedure that ZESA plans to introduce for FY93, ZESA made a profit of Z$30.2 million in
FY1991/92, compared to net losses of Z$15.9 million in 1990/91 and Z$1.6 million in 1989/90.
Interest costs have accelerated at a fast pace due to a mushrooming debt, following large currency
devaluations, and negative internal cash generation for capital expenditure, which had to be met by
borrowing.
4.5             The following table summarizes the cash flow of ZESA and shows aggregate capital
expenditure and the manner in which it was financed during the last three years.

4.6             The above figures clearly show the financial inadequacy of electricity tariffs during
the period under review. ZESA was financially not viable as it was unable to meet its debt service
requirements during this period. Internal cash generation provided only 80% of debt service needs.
The negative internal financing of Z$556 million, together with a slightly larger capital expenditure,
was financed entirely by borrowing. External borrowing represented almost 200% of capital
expenditure during the last three years.
4.7             The table below provides a summary of the financial position of ZESA over the past
three balance sheet dates.

4.8           The Zimbabwe dollar depreciated by about 58% against the US dollar over three
years to June 1992, declining by 35%  in the last twelve months.  The devaluation has had
considerable negative impact on the financial position of ZESA. Since July 1989, ZESA has incurred
exchange losses of Z$852 million on its foreign currency debt; Z$285 million of which was realized
in debt repayments during the three years. The cumulative loss represents 138% of equity at June
30, 1992. The effect of devaluation, together with external financing of 100% of additional working
capital requirements and capital expenditure, is witnessed in the deterioration of the debt/equity ratio
from a healthy 55% at June 30, 1989 to a high 76 % at June 30, 1992. The financial squeeze is
evident from specific current net debt obligations of Z$378 million. The ratio of accounts receivable
from subscribers to annual sales deteriorated from 72 days at June 30, 1990 to 85 days at June 30,
1992.
Accoxtg forfordm  exchange ,nevenn
4.9           Due to the continuing and significant devaluation of the Zimbabwe dollar during the
past few years, ZESA's historic accounting policy with respect to foreign exchange obligations
became increasingly inappropriate. Consequently, the Bank and ZESA agreed upon a new policy to
be adopted in its audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 1993. The new policy,
which is in compliance with the International Accounting Standard 21 (IAS 21 - Accounting for the
effects of changes in foreign exchange rates), has been agreed upon by ZESA's Board, and its
external auditors, Deloitte & Touche.



39
4.10          The revised accounting policy provides for the following:
Exchange losses arsing on long-term loans relating to the acqui&iion of fixed
assets.
(a)           Unrealized exchange losses to June 30, 1990 plus losses arising
during 1990/91 and 1991/92 to be capitalised to fixed assets,
provided the resulting asset values do not exceed replacement cost or
recoverable amount of assets in their present condition and use.
(b)           Capitalised exchange losses to be depreciated from July 1, 1990 over
the remaining asset lives as at that date. These were determined at
18 years for Hwange I and 22 years for Hwange II. Exchange losses
relating to on- going projects such as Power II are taken to work in
progress and are to be depreciated from date of commissioning.
(c)           Exchange losses arising from  significant future devaluations,
including gradual devaluation which adds up to a sizable decline in
any year, will be capitalised, provided: (i) such devaluations are
permanent in nature and are not likely to be reversed by subsequent
appreciations; and (ii) the conditions in (a) above are met. Such
additional capitalised losses will be depreciated as described above.
AU other exchange differences
(a)    All other exchange gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, are to be
taken to income in the year in which they arise.
4.11          It is considered that the new accounting policy will better reflect the underlying
financial performance and position of ZESA. Assets will be regularly revalued (in Zim$ terms) for
the effects of all significant devaluations and the additional charge for depreciation will give a more
accurate measure of the costs of electricity supply. Exchange losses will no longer be charged to
income as incurred, but will instead be spread over the productive lives of assets which give rise to
those loans. In other words, costs will be better matched against income. In summary, the equity
base will not be eroded, and the rate of return and debt/equity ratios will provide a more meaningful
measure of financial performance.
4.12          The historical financial performance for 1990/91 and 1991/92 and the financial
projections to 1997/98 are presented on the basis of the new foreign exchange policy described above.
However, the 1989/90 figures have been stated under ZESA's old accounting policy, except that the
realized exchange losses charged to income have been added to operating expenses (instead of finance
charges) and thus deducted in arriving at operating income, and the return on assets is based on the
historical book value of assets in service, plus deferred (unrealized) exchange losses.

ZESA 's Plnndal Projections.
4.13            The financial projections of ZESA for the next six years 1992/93 through to 1997/98
are set out in detail in Annexes 4.1 to 4.4. Notes and assumptions made in the preparation of these
forecasts are given in Annex 4.5. Certain important assumptions with regard to currency exchange
rates, load growth, plant availability, electricity imports and inflation are subject to considerable
uncertainty. Adjustments may therefore be required to the projected figures if these assumptions are
not met in any significant respect. It is also assumed that ZESA's credit worthiness in the capital
markets will be maintained throughout to enable it to raise the necessary financing for its heavy
capital expenditure program during the next six years.
4.14            The major projected financial indicators for three selected years are set out in the
following table. Despite a 12 % fall in sales due to the drought, financial performance in FY1992/93
will be much improved over 1991/92 due to cumulative tariff increases of 76%. Debt service
coverage is forecast to be a satisfactory 1.33. However, funds from internal sources are projected to
contribute only 1 % to the three-year average of capital expenditure.

4.15            For ZESA to operate commercially, retain its credit worthiness and meet its future
financial needs, its financial performance must improve further and be sustained at a higher level.
This will be achieved by the attainment of appropriate financial targets for debt service coverage and
revenue contribution to capital investment throughout the life of the project.  In this regard,
agreement was reached at negotiations that ZESA will achieve a minimum debt service cover of at
least 1.25 times and will finance an average of at least 25% of its capital investment program from
internal sources. These are considered to be appropriate and mutually consistent minimum financial
targets for the utility.



41
4.16         ZESA has implemented a tariff increase of 23.8%, effective September 1, 1993, for
1993/94 sufficient to achieve the proposed financial covenants. A provision of the FY94 ZESA
Operations Plan allows ZESA to adjust tariffs during the year without the need for further
Government approval should the devaluation of the Zimbabwe dollar and the cost of fuel and/or
power imports diverge significantly from the forecasts on which the tariff adjustment was based. A
method for adjusting FY95 tariffs for similar unavoidable cost increases will be included in the
ZESA FY95 Operations Plan.
4.17         After 1993/94, the scale of tariff adjustments that will be required to achieve the
financial performance targets will depend largely on the rate of local inflation and the consequent
slide in the value of the Zimbabwe dollar, which will result in higher operating costs and debt
service, and on the size of the capital expenditure program, which will require external financing and
add to debt servicing obligations. Based on the Bank's current inflation assumptions and ZESA's
planned investment program, the following increases in the average tariff are forecast to be required
over the next four fiscal years in order to achieve the financial covenants:
July 1, 1994               22.5%
July 1, 1996               26.5%
July 1, 1997               2.0%
4.18          With these increases, it is projected that the Authority will generate adequate funds
from its operations to achieve a satisfactory debt service coverage ranging between 1.25 and 1.63,
and to finance approximately 24% of capital expenditure during the period. The rate of return on
partly revalued assets would vary between 20% and 31%, but would be much lower on a fully
revalued basis. As part of its FY94 Operations Plan, ZESA has agreed to complete a revaluation of
its assets and to estimate the rate of return on net revalued assets so that this important indicator of
financial performance is available. ZESA's debt/equity ratio is projected to decline from 76 % in June
1992 to 67% in June 1998, which is still high compared to the 60% gearing normally expected of
power companies by the capital market. The status of accounts receivable deteriorated during the past
fiscal year from 85 days of sales at June 30, 1992 to 92 days at the end of 1992, compared to 60 days
target agreed under Power II loan. The projections assume a gradual improvement in ZESA's
collection efforts, consistent with the annual targets formally agreed with ZESA, so as to reach the
desired 60 days of sales by 1996/97.
4.19         The financial projections will require constant updating to take account of changes
in macro-economic variables and the availability of external financing for the significant capital
investment program. The levels of electricity tariffs will be regularly reviewed by Bank supervision
missions in the light of evolving circumstances.

V. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
Economic Objectives and Benefits of dIe Project
5.1           The project's major short-term objective is to minimize the risk of power
shortages in Zimbabwe over the next two to three years. In FY92, the last fiscal year before the
drought in southern Africa, 10,226 GWh of power was supplied to the Zimbabwe system and
final electricity sales totalled 9,248 GWh. In FY93, Zimbabwe's available power supply was
reduced to only 9,000 GWh, equivalent to sales of 8,100 GWh - a 12.5% decline. The drought
also reduced power demand in FY93, but only by about half the fall in sales. The remaining
shortfall forced the imposition of consumption quotas for four months and load shedding on 64
days during the year.
5.2          In FY94, an additional 500 GWh of supply will be available from Zaire, but
Zimbabwe's entitlement from the Kariba hydro complex will be cut by 450 GWh, so that the
lake level can begin to recover. With average rains in 1993, generation at the Kafue Gorge
Power Station in Zambia has resumed, which allows Zambia to provide some energy and short-
term emergency support to Zimbabwe. Assuming there are no significant technical problems
with any of the major generating stations and transmission links, and that Zimbabwean demand
remains below the FY92 level, power supply may be just sufficient to meet demand in FY94.
Conversely, any major supply interruption or more rapid demand growth would cause a power
shortage to re-emerge. The supply outlook for 1994/95 depends heavily on next season's rains,
but with Lake Kariba so low, the probability is that supply will continue to be inadequate,
particularly as economic recovery should be well underway. Certain relief from the supply
constraint will only come with the commissioning of the first of the planned high-voltage
interconnectors with either South Africa or Mozambique in late 1995 or 1996.
5.3          If not contained, the shortage of electric energy and system reserve that
Zimbabwe faces for the next two to three years could impose a very significant economic cost
on the country. In a thorough impact assessment of the power shortage in 1992/93, the
Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries estimated that each kWh of unmet power demand from
its members resulted in the loss of over Z$1.35 in gross output, not counting any secondary
impacts. With 70% of electricity being consumed by the industrial, mining and agricultural
sectors, any serious shortfall in power supply results in a significant economic penalty. With
incomes and employment having been severely cut by the drought and the ESAP at a pivotal
stage when the perceived pain outweighs the gain, Zimbabwe cannot afford the economic
disruption that further significant power shortages would cause.
5.4          In addition to the steps taken to secure maximum imports from Zaire, the keys
to minimizing the severity and duration of the power shortage, and hence its economic cost, are
to: (a) maximize output from the four thermal generating stations, particularly Hwange, by far
the largest and most modern; (b) raise tariffs to a full cost-recovery level to squeeze out
uneconomic consumption; and (c) commission the planned high-voltage interconnectors with
Mozambique and South Africa as quickly as possible. Reducing technical losses on the
transmission and distribution system would also help. This project will help achieve the first two



- 44 -
of these objectives, and will also marginally reduce losses. It will therefore produce considerable
economic benefits over the 1994-96 period alone. Over the longer term, the improved
performance of Hwange Power Station and reinforcement of the distribution system will mean
more adequate and reliable power supply and better use of existing power assets. The process
of commercializing ZESA, which the project will facilitate, will also produce considerable
economic benefits for Zimbabwe, mainly through the efficiency improvements it will stimulate
in ZESA, resulting in lower electricity costs.
Economic Jusl ation  of the Hwange Power Sation Upgrade Component
5.5          While the planned Mozambique and South African interconnectors will satisfy
much of the incremental power demand after 1996, improving the performance of Hwange Power
Station will be critical to meeting demand in the interim and to reducing the cost of power and
sustaining reliability when adequate import supplies are available. This improved performance
will be partially achieved by the comprehensive maintenance, overhaul and technical assistance
program and by the improved spares provision facilitated by the project. The project also includes
a substantial Upgrade Program for the Hwange station, which is intended to correct some of the
most serious technical flaws in the station's design and equipment specifications that have
significantly affected its reliability and efficiency. Due to its considerable capital cost (40% of
total project costs), the economic justification of this project component was analyzed separately
and confirmed. First, some of the potential upgrade investments, such as the costly installation
of a third coal mill on each of the Stage II generating units, were reviewed and ruled out by a
preliminary cost/benefit analysis. The remaining candidate upgrade investments were then
subjected to a detailed technical assessment by specialist consultants and the final scope of the
component based on their recommendations.
5.6          The Upgrade Program's composition and scheduling are designed to minimize
outages of the affected parts of the power station. None of the work will require a total station
shut-down.  Most of the individual upgrades can be implemented with minimal effect on
operation, other than short-term outages of parts of the station for commissioning of the new
equipment. In the cases of the Stage I Process Control and Auxiliary Cooling Water System
upgrades, work will be coordinated with the planned and statutory unit outages.
5.7          The economic justification of the Hwange Upgrade Program was confirmed by
estimating its economic rate of return (ERR). The period of analysis used for the estimate is a
very conservative 12 years. The economic costs used in the analysis are the capital costs of the
investments, escalated by a shadow foreign exchange factor of 25%, plus the variable costs of
the incremental output that the upgraded station will be required to supply and be capable of
following the upgrade program up to the year 2005. The benefits are the incremental delivered
supply that ZESA's system production costing model shows will be required of the station to
meet demand at least cost up to 2005 and which can be achieved only if its average availability
is improved to 80% and sustained at this level, which it is judged the upgrade investments will
render feasible. The incremental supplies, net of transmission and distribution losses, are valued
at the most conservative indicator of consumer willingness-to-pay, the FY93 average tariff of
Zcl7.5/kWh. The variable cost of generation includes a full program of maintenance, overhaul
and spares, which the project will ensure through 1996 and are essential for the benefits of the



- 45 -
upgrade program to be fully realized. From this analysis, the ERR the Hwange Upgrade
component is estimated to be at least 14% (Annex 5.1).
Economic Justfation of the Dishibution Component
5.8           The project's distribution component consists of eleven sub-projects selected from
a slate of candidate distribution investments on the basis of their economic viability. Although
all of the candidate distribution investments will permit additional demands for power to be
served in the longer term, this is not feasible for 2-3 years, due to the shortage of supply. In the
economic evaluation, it has therefore been assumed that the additional demands are realized from
1996 onwards. These benefits are valued at Zc7/kWh, the estimated margin between the cost of
bulk supply and the current tariff. The distribution investments will also reduce technical losses
on the distribution system, which will provide immediate economic benefits by increasing the
supply available to consumers. The estimated loss savings of each potential investment, valued
at the current tariff, are used as the measure of these benefits. The resulting total benefit stream
is evaluated against each sub-project's capital, operating and maintenance costs, with the foreign
exchange components shadow priced at a premium of 25 % to reflect the scarcity value of foreign
exchange. An economic rate of return of 10% was set as the minimum to qualify a candidate
distribution sub-project for acceptance. The estimated costs and benefits of the eleven sub-
projects that met this qualification standard, their benefit/cost ratios and economic rates of return
are summarized in Annex 5.2.
Economic Rate of Rturn
5.9          The major short-term economic benefit of the proposed project will be to reduce
unserved energy and the risk of supply interruptions over the critical two to three years when
hydro-electric generation will be constrained and until the first of the interconnectors with either
Mozambique or South Africa is in service. Later, in addition to reliably meeting power demand,
it will minimize the cost of supply by making more effective use of existing generation facilities
and giving ZESA greater flexibility in power purchase and system dispatch decisions.
5.10         The project is an integral part of ZESA's Power Plan III investment program,
which is designed to meet the demand for power through the balance of the 1990s and into the
early years of the next century reliably and at minimum cost. Given that the project is an integral
part of Power Plan III, it is impossible to forecast precisely the contribution to power supply of
any one component of the Power Plan III Program in isolation. Hence the Economic Rate of
Return has been estimated for the Power Plan III Program as a whole. The period 1994-2005 was
conservatively used as the reference period for the analysis on the grounds that, while there will
be significant benefits after this date, their size is hard to predict.
5.11         The capital costs of Power Plan III, expressed in economic terms, are summarized
in Annex 5.3. These capital costs are combined with the operating and maintenance costs of the
kilowatthours to be supplied from the facilities to be constructed under Power Plan III to estimate
its total cost. ZESA's System Production Costing model estimated the incremental power supply
that will contributed by those investments each year and the operating and maintenance costs of
that output. This model uses actual costs of all generating plants and interconnections to



- 46 -
optimally despatch the supplies available to meet the system load at least-cost. Both the capital
and operating costs are converted from financial to economic costs by use of a shadow price
factor of 1.25 for the imported components to reflect the scarcity value of foreign exchange.
5.12         The incremental energy to be supplied by the Power Plan III investments over
the period 1995-2005, valued at consumers' willingness to pay for electricity, is used as the
measure of benefits. The very short time-frame used for benefit estimation relative to the asset
lives means that the selected methodology certainly understates the Program's actual benefit
stream. The most conservative measure of willingness to pay for the incremental power to be
supplied by Power Plan III is the current average power tariff of Zc17.5/kWh (USc3/kWh).
Based on this measure, the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of the program is 27%, well above
the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Zimbabwe of about 10% (Annex 5.4).
Economic Risks
5.13         Power Plan III involves no major technical risks and there is little risk of a
significant cost overrun as most of the items to be procured are standard power station and
transmission equipment. The major potential risk with respect to the economic viability of Power
Plan III is that future demand growth will be slower than forecast. Although the forecast average
growth in demand of just under 3% over the 1992-2010 period is marginally below historical
experience and is considered relatively conservative, given the economic reform program and
existing suppressed demand, it is likely that recent substantial tariff increases and further
projected increases will cause consumers to reassess and in some cases reduce their use of
electricity. This could moderate future demand growth. The sensitivity of the ERR to a slower
rate of demand growth was therefore tested by estimating the switching value for this variable.
From this analysis, it is estimated that the demand forecast would need to overstate actual demand
by 53% for the ERR to fall to 10%, the estimated opportunity cost of capital. Over-estimation
of demand to this extent is considered highly unlikely. It is therefore considered that the
program's economic viability is robust over the likely range of demand forecasting error.
5.14         There is a serious economic risk to Zimbabwe from delay in implementation of
the project proposed and other components of the Power Plan III investment program, due to the
shortage of power that would probably result. Hwange Power Station will need to produce around
5,000 GWh of electricity in FY94 and nearly 5,500 GWh in FY95 to meet projected demand.
In order to achieve these high levels of output, all the Hwange components of this project must
be completed on or close to schedule. By FY96, power demand is very likely to exceed supply
from existing sources. It is therefore imperative that at least one of the interconnectors to be
constructed under Power Plan III be commissioned early in this fiscal year at the latest.

SECTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
RELATING TO REFORM OF THE POWER SECTOR
1.    Government will implement reforms in the legal and institutional framework to enable PSEs
to increase efficiency and to increase their autonomy and responsibility. Under the UNDP-supported
assistance to the Public Enterprise Reform program, consultants will help Government prepare reform
programs no later than June 1993. The measures involved will include:
(i)    Revisions to legislation, including statutory corporation acts, to streamline ministerial
oversight of PSEs and confer greater authority to Boards for decisions regarding
budget approval, salary levels, hiring and dismissal of employees, procurement,
product lines, and pricing policies;
(ii)   Legislative reforms, including revision to statutory corporation acts, to facilitate
private sector participation in areas currently subject to public sector monopoly, and,
in particular, to remove any legal impediments to joint ventures between PSEs and
private sector companies;
(iii)   Review of the regulatory framework under which PSEs operate in relation to
Government.
(iv)   Reforms to create a more transparent environment for the operation of PSEs through
the phased reduction of indirect subsidies such as government loan guarantees,
exemptions from customs duty, indirect and direct tax exemptions.
2.    For PSEs that remain in the public sector, phased enterprise-specific reform programs are
being developed to increase their efficiency and improved financial performance. The broad strategy
of commercialization is to be pursued through granting greater autonomy, creating incentives for
management to improve efficiency, and establishing performance targets. Generic actions being taken
include:
(i)    The general introduction of performance targets and performance-related pay for the
top management of NRZ, ZESA, PTC, AFC and the four major agricultural
marketing boards with extension to all PSEs by December 1993.
(ii)   The development of a corporate plan to be the basic tool for monitoring PSE
performance.
3.    Consistent with Government's plan for commercializing PSEs, the restructuring program for
Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) has been launched. The Government will reach
agreement by July 1993 on an operational framework to be introduced in FY93/94 under which: (a)

Annex 1.3
Page 2 of 2
ZESA will undertake to complete its program of internal reorganization and streamlining its
managerial structure to increase efficiency and reduce costs and to meet specified operational and
financial targets; and (b) Government will undertake to ensure ZESA autonomy in its operations,
notably in the determination of its personnel policies and procurement goods and services below a
threshold value, which is under review. The framework will also provide for tariffs to be reviewed
regularly, and adjusted if necessary, to reflect the economic costs of power generated and distributed,
and for performance related pay for senior managers. Government has made provision in the new
power system development plan for the private sector to generate and supply power to the national
grid.

order to allow for line gang to travel along the line to do the maintenance. The lack of radio
communications necessitate prolonged planned outages. Line maintenance is coordinated with
the maintenance of the terminal equipment. However, situations may arise where the line
may be out of service because of planned outages for the terminal equipment.

ZIMBABWE: PUBLIC ENTERPRISE REFORM - ZESA PROGRAM OF ACTION
Consultant Terms of Reference
1) Overall Objective
To define a two-phase Program of Action for implementation by the
Government and ZESA that will raise the operational performance of ZESA to that of a well-
managed power utility within a period of two to three years and sustain that performance
thereafter. The first phase of the Program, to consist of immediate measures and first year
perfornance targets, is to be in place by July 1, 1993 and the design of the second phase is to
be completed by December 31, 1993 for implementation on or before July 1, 1994.
2) Description of Work
PHASE I
Task 1: Design a ZESA Performance Improvement Program for FY93/94
Objective: Identify priority actions to improve the performance of ZESA that can be taken in
the short-term (prior to or early in FY93/94) by the Government and ZESA and prepare and
negotiate with the two parties an Operations Agreement defining the steps to be taken by both
parties and the related target performance to be achieved by ZESA in FY93/94.
Scooe of Work: Working to a timetable consistent with implementing the first phase of a
ZESA efficiency improvement program in FY93/94, the consultant will:
(1)          Undertake a preliminary assessment of ZESA's operational and financial
performance over the past three years, taking account of the drought situation,
and identify the major areas and approximate degree of inadequate
performance.
(2)          Identify the major causes of the poor performances in these areas, such as: (a)
weaknesses in ZESA's organization, management, staffing, financial and
operational practices; and (b) Government policies and practices, including
investment and procurement oversight, foreign exchange allocation, tariff and
financial policies, influence on operational and personnel decisions, etc.
(3)          Identify the actions that can be taken immediately or in the short term to
remove or reduce the major impediments to ZESA's improved performance
and recommend a first-phase Program of Action by ZESA and the
Government that will remove or reduce these critical impediments. The
Program should comprise a series of specific steps to be taken by ZESA and
the Government and be based on a realistic timetable for their implementation.
(4)          Propose a set of simple, achievable and monitorable performance targets for
ZESA for FY93/94, covering finance, operations and technical areas, based
on the recommended Program of Action.
(5)          Prepare, negotiate and agree with ZESA and the Government an Operations
Agreement, to be signed by both parties prior to July 1, 1993, that sets
ZESA's performance targets for FY93/94 and outlines the agreed Program of
Action by both parties that will permit the achievement of those targets.

account of the legal and regulatory framework of the power sector and Government plans for
changes therein, propose a specific Plan of Action to achieve and sustain an appropriate
standard of performance for ZESA. Define a set of specific performance indicators and
appropriate targets against which ZESA's future performance can be assessed over the period
beginning FY94/95. Draft, negotiate and agree with ZESA and the Government an Operations
Agreement for FY94/95 that defines ZESA's agreed performance targets and the actions that
ZESA and the Government will take to permit their achievement.

ZIMBABWE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AUTHORITY
POWER III PROJECT
Detailed Project Description
A. DISTRIBUTION
ZESA has carried out a series of technical audits of its generation and transmission facilities
in connection with developments of its master plans for the power sector. ZESA is planning to carry
out a master plan for its distribution systems in major consumption centers with the assistance
provided by the AfDB. Technical auditing of ZESA's existing distribution system, has, however,
not been carried out extensively and is expected to be done by ZESA during the implementation
period of this project. Any major rehabilitation which may thus be identified will either form part
of a next project or, depending on the availability of funds, added to this project. The requirements
described below will solve urgent known problems in the existing system.
Northern Region
1.    Guruve Substation (Nl) Installation of a 5 MVA 33/11 kV OLTC (on-load tap changes)
transformer, complete with protection and measuring year for four feeder bays, and construction of
22 km 33kV line, with the objective of loss reduction (300 kW peak) in the 11 kV distribution
system, presently fed via 1.5 MVA transformer and 11 kV lines.
2.    Centenary North (N2) Installation of a lx5 MVA 33/11 kV substation, complete with
protection and measuring gear for four feeder bays, with the objective of saving 400 kW peak on the
existing overloaded 11 kV network. (18 km of 33 kV line will be constructed under a separate
funding).
3.    Battlefields - Venice - Brompton (N3) Network reinforcement through the installation of a
1 x 15 MVA 88/33 kV transformer and the construction of 30 km 33 kV lines. Voltage conditions
will be substantially improved and an estimated loss reduction of 300 kW peak will be achieved.
4.    Golden Valley - Chakari (N10) A total of 470 kW peak losses will be saved by installing a
total of 4 MVAr 11 kV capacitors at Golden Valley and Chakari. (35 km 33 kV line will be uprated
to 175 mm2 ACSR under ADB funding).
5.    Kadoma - CheLutu - Norton (N15) Reinforcement of 20 km 33 kV line in Kadoma, Chegutu
and Norton, through reconducturing by 175 mm2 ACSR. A loss saving of 400 kW peak will be
achieved.

ANNEX 3.1
Page 2 of 15
Southern Region
6.    Gweru Network Rehabilitation (S4) Overload and voltage problems exist on the Gweru 11
kV network strung with 16 mm2 copper conductor. Reliability of supply is also poor due to theft of
copper conductor which has a high scrap value. The estimated peak loss is excessively high at 1500
kW peak. The project provides for the reconducturing of the line using 100 mm2 ACSR. The
benefits that accrue are substantial improvement in reliability of supply and voltage conditions, and
reduction of peak losses by about 1200 kW.
7.    Gwenoru Dam (S 10) Installation of a 2 MVAr capacitor bank to reduce losses by about 220
kW peak and improve the voltage profile.
Western Region
8.    Shaneani Substation (WI) Loading and voltage problems exist on the Marvel/Shangani 66
kV network. Present maximum demand is 17 MW, and unmet demand is estimated at 4.5 MW.
Network losses exceed 2.5 MW and the voltage drop is estimated at 16%. The project provides for
the construction of a 50 km 132 kV line, a 132 kV feeder bay and a 1 x 30 MVA 132/11 kV
substation at Shangani.
9.    Figtree - Plumtree Reinforcement (W2) Installation of a total of 1 MVAr Capacitors at
Figtree and Plumtree.
10.   Beitbridge - Mazunga - Nottingham M) Construction of 28 km 33 kV line to reinforce the
network in the area. Voltage conditions will be normalized and loss reduction is estimated at 200
kW peak.
11.   Gwanda - Colleen Bawn Reinforcement (W4) Constructing 25 km of 175 mm2 33 kV line
to reinforce an existing overloaded line thereby reducing losses by an estimated 500 kW peak. The
reinforcement will also help provide the additional requested demand by Gwanda - Colleen Bawn
when capacity becomes available.
12.   Load Shedding. The need for load shedding when there is a major plant shutdown has been
aggravated by the recent regional drought and the consequent shortage of imported and indigenous
hydro power. ZESA has therefore introduced improved management of power shortage through load
shedding as one of the objectives of the proposed project.
13.   Load shedding can be effected automatically by applying automation equipment in progressive
steps, using either the simpler devices which apply ripple control signals to switch off water heaters
and similar loads or more sophisticated devices which trip feeder circuits at substations upon major
system disturbance. ZESA has a ripple control device which could switch off about 40MW of load
(water heaters) by sending signals from the load control center at Harare. Switching on upon
restoration of supply is also done manually, and in view of this ripple control devices are semi-
automatic (not actuated automatically by system behavior). ZESA intends to install additional ripple
control equipment in Harare and other major towns to be able to switch off selectively additional



- 67 -
ANNEX 3.1
Page 3 of 15
loads until major plant outages are restored. Technical auditing of the existing ripple control system
will also be carried out and needed refurbishment and upgrading, will be undertaken under the
proposed project. Automatic load shedding is best performed by making substation equipment
respond to pre-set frequency thresholds and instigate load shedding action in pre-arranged steps and
programs. ZESA has carried out a study to assess the needs for under frequency actuated load
shedding of up to 400MW under severe system disturbances. The following load shedding schemes
are planned: (i) instantaneous under frequency 50MW load shedding for each of the following
frequencies: 48.5 Hz, 48.25 Hz and 48 Hz; (ii) instantaneous rate of change of frequency at 0.8 Hz
per second for load shedding of 100MW; and (iii) time delayed under frequency 25MW load
shedding for each of the following: 48 Hz, 1 second duration; 48.75 Hz, 30 seconds; and 49.5 Hz,
60 seconds. A single under frequency relay will manage the load shedding over the frequency ranges
outlined above. Some 30 relays will be purchased for installation at the following substations:
Northern area (substations Bindura, Muzowe, Mutorashage, Chinhoyi, Kudoma, Chegatu, Norton
and Morondera); Southern area (Gweru, Kwekwe, Zvishavane, Zimasco): Western area (Forrestvale,
Valleyfields, Hyde Park, Mpopoma, London Road, Donnington); and Harare area (at thermal station
and at substations to be determined).
B. HWANGE POWER PLANT
14.   Hwange power plant, accounting for 47% of ZESA's total installed capacity, will continue
to be the major source of electric power supply to Zimbabwe. Improving and maintaining Hwange's
reliability at a high level, particularly over the period up to the commissioning of the next source of
power supply, is a major objective of ZESA's generation planning. Staffing the power plant with
qualified and experienced personnel, providing resources to maintain the power plant are essential
strategies of the generation planning
15.   ZESA's mine-mouth coal fired power station at Hwange was constructed in two stages. The
first stage (Stage I) with 4 x 120MW installed capacity was commissioned in 1984, and the second
stage (Stage II) with 2 x 220MW installed capacity in 1987. Hwange's performance has been erratic
in the past. In 1989/90, the plant load factor was as low as 54.6%, but after carrying out
modifications of the Stage I coal mills under the Bank's Power I loan, the performance of Stage I
units has improved substantially, with plant load factor for the last three years averaging 75.4%. On
the other hand, the number of trips has been increasing from 227 in 1989/90 to 336 in 1991/92. This
makes the reliability of Stage I unsatisfactory. The trippings also result in increased diesel fuel
consumption. These are attributed to poor process control and unsatisfactory instrumentation,
inadequate and, designwise less than satisfactory, cooling water system, dusty environment, and high
ambient temperature particularly in the control and relay rooms. The undersized cooling water
system has been a cause for vacuum loss accounting, almost without exception, for complete
shutdown of Hwange occasionally experienced in the ZESA system. (On August 25, 1992, there was
a complete shutdown of the power plant, attributed to this cause. Resumption of supply took 17.5
hours.) The proposed project aims at addressing major constraints in the smooth and efficient
operation of Hwange power station.
16.   The Power I Loan (Ln 2212-ZIM) has, among others, provided assistance to operate and
maintain the power plant and spare parts. The Power II Loan (Ln. 2900-ZIM) is also providing



- 68 -
ANNEX 3.1
Page 4 of 15
support for Hwange operations. The proposed Power III Project will provide support to Hwange as
follows: (i) Operations Support; (ii) Maintenance Materials and Spares; (iii) Maintenance Services;
(iv) Generating Plant Major Overhauls; and (v) Upgrading and Refurbishment.
17.   Operations Support.  The main objective of the Hwange operations subcomponent is to
strengthen indigenous capability initiated under Power I Loan and to ensure, through transfer of
know-how and job-oriented training, sustainability in managing the operations and maintenance of
the Hwange power plant. Accordingly provision is made for a total of about 310 man-months of
expert services as follows: in the areas of power plant management and performance (72 m/m);
computer-aided stores administration and system (36 m/m); computer-aided power plant maintenance
planning (36 W/m); protection systems (36 m/m); generation services engineering (48 m/m); training
of ZESA power plant and generation staff through short term employment of training specialists and
the use of ZESA's training facilities, as well as through exposure to functional overseas experience
(48 m/m); technical auditing on as needed basis and expert services in specialized fields (36 m/m).
18.   Maintenance materials and spares Government's foreign exchange yearly allocations of US$
1.5 million for generation and transmission is not adequate to meet ZESA's needs for spare parts and
materials. Recent experience indicate annual expenditure of US$ 3.1 million for consumables and
spares alone. These total US$ 9.2 million for a 3-year program. An overall total of US$ 11.9
million, in 1992 prices, is provided for materials and spares.
19.   Maintenance Services Proprietary highly skilled maintenance service contracts, estimated at
a total of 200 m/m, are needed for the main plant components such as coal milling, boilers, turbo-
alternators, water treatment plant.
20.   Generation Plant Major Overhauls Major overhauling every 50,000 equivalent running hours,
is programmed for Hwange units as follows:
Unit 5        October 1993
Unit 6       February 1994
Unit 3       February 1995
Unit 4       October 1995
Unit 1       February 1996
Unit 2 will be overhauled in February 1993 under Power II for spares and services. Based on the
historical costs for major overhauling of units 4, 3 and 1, and the quotations in hand for units 5 and
6, a provision of US$ 27.4 million is made for spares and services over the period 1993-1996.
21.   Hwan,e Upgrade Program. ZESA employed a consultant (Technical Audit Consulting
Services Ltd of UK) to review major causes for plant breakdown, suggest remedies, prepare a Design
Report and specifications and bid documents for the purchase of the required plant. The main



- 69 -
ANNEX 3.1
Page 5 of 15
findings of the Consultants are given in the Draft Design Report (February 1993)1/, and is
summarized hereunder.
22.    Major problem areas affecting plant availability, output and efficiency are the Process Control
System for Stage I and the Cooling Water Systems.
23.    The Process Control System refers to boiler sequence control and its interface with the burner
management system. The existing boiler control system is based on pneumatic technology for the
closed loop system, and relay technology for the open loop burners management system. Pneumatic
controllers require clean environment and pure dry air supply. The high humidity of Hwange and
stem/water leaks within the power station are causing ingress of moisture into the pipework
generating internal oxidation which results in ingress of iron oxide into sensitive components of
pneumatic controllers and associated equipment. Rate of replacement of spares and costs thereof have
been increasing substantially. On the other hand, manufacturing of pneumatic control equipment is
being phased out gradually due to changes in technology. In addition, the response of a pneumatic
control system to rapid turbine load changes following system disturbances in the relatively small
power system of ZESA is not fast enough. The system is satisfactory for base load operation, but
does not cope fast enough to keep the unit within drum level or furnace pressure tripping limits
during system disturbances. The 300m long pipelines also limit its speed of response. In view of
these constraints, false indications and spurious alarms and trips were common, resulting in the
abolition of the use of the system in favor of manual control. The hardwired relay sequence control
system referred to above being susceptible to pulverized fuel fouling is becoming progressively
unreliable for boiler protection. Maloperation is becoming frequent and coal mills have to be tripped
manually. Sourcing and replacement of parts is also becoming difficult because of the outdated
design of relay control system.
24.    The boiler control panel instrumentation is either out of service or missing. the generally
accepted safety standards requiring redundancy in instrumentation are not complied with in the boiler
field instrumentation (for furnace supervision and protection) and for boiler drum level measurement.
25.    The burner management system has one set of four oil burners between two coal mills A and
D and another set between the remaining two mills C and D. Each oil burner supplies 750 kg/hour
of oil to the furnace. The oil burners are used for start up (up to 20% load), and also for flame
stability when an adjacent mill is operated at less than 60 % of rating. There is no sidewall lighting
up of burners, resulting in excessive consumption of imported oil in the existing oil burners. A
project to provide coke oven gas to Hwange power plant is under discussion. the gas can be install
as sidewall lighting up burners for the 16 coal burners. In the event of introduction of sidewall
lighting, it is suggested to replace the existing burner management system for the oil burners by an
extension of a digital microprocessor control system. The control system would provide for
automatic starting and stopping of light oil and coke oven gas support as a function of mill loading
requirements.

26.   The entire Stage I pneumatic control and relay control system would be replaced by either
a solid state electronic system as is provided for Stage II or by a proven technology microprocessor
based distributed digital control system. The pros and cons of the two systems, including the
durability of the type of system selected, as well as the long term availability of spares and probable
redundancy of Stage II solid state design, will be discussed and agreed upon during the detail
engineering phase. In addition, the level of automation and instrumentation for the boiler and turbine
would be improved to ensure coordinated unit control, and the existing boiler control panels would
be replaced. Deficiencies in all areas of instrumentation and control would be rectified under the
project.
27.   The Cooling Water Systems refer to the circulating cooling Water System and to the
Auxiliary Cooling Water Systems of Stages I and II. The Circulating Cooling Water (CCW) system
condenses the low pressure steam exhausted by each unit's turbine through the use of individual
surface type condensers in conjunction with two common cooling towers. The Auxiliary Cooling
Water System (ACW) taps water from the main cooling water system for cooling the auxiliary
equipments in the station (like oil coolers, bearing coolers, hydrogen coolers etc.). The essential
components of the circulating cooling water system of Hwange are five motor driven pumps, two
natural draught cooling towers with storage basins and a forebay area linked by cooling water
channels, chlorine dosing equipment, and a pipe network connecting the pumps to the unit condensers
and other users. The make up water is supplied from the Zambezi river through pumps and storage
tanks to a forebay area and into the cooling tower basins.
28.   The cooling towers are designed for a cooling load for all of Stage I units (4 x 120MW) and
for only one (not two) of the Stage II units (1 x 220MW). The assumption of 26.1C ambient
temperature specified in the design of the cooling towers lowers appreciably the performance of the
towers during the hot season at Hwange when temperatures range between 35C - 45C. The design
capacity of the circulating cooling water pumps is also insufficient to meet the requirements of all six
units let alone the additional cooling water loads of the station's auxiliary cooling water requirements.
Prudence dictates that for a station of such relative importance and for critical components like
pumps, at least one standby pump should be provided in order to maintain total station output in the
event of failure of a pump. Installation of two pumps would thus be necessary. Site conditions do
not permit installation of one additional pump.
29.   ZESA has considered a number of options to resolve the capacity constraints of the cooling
tower and the water pumps. Possible options for the cooling tower are: (i) replacing the existing
cooling fills with a more efficient design; (ii) install a compact induced draught cooling tower to
service all the station auxiliary cooling water, thereby reducing the cooling load on the cooling
towers; and (iii) advance the building of the natural draught cooling tower required as part of Hwange
Stage III development, thereby maintaining the existing towers at their design cooling load duty. For
the first option, the down time of about two to three months to effect the replacement of a new fill
will be too costly to ZESA {(estimate at say 200MW x 1440 x .72 x (.13, sales price less cost of coal
and diesel oil of .03) =Z$20.7 million)) and damaging to the economy. The second option is
estimated to produce a 3.9% reduction in cooling load, still leaving a deficiency in cooling tower
performance of at least 5%. Thus this option offers only a partial solution. The third option
presupposes that Hwange Stage III, which will be an extension of Stage II providing additional 2 x



- 71 -
ANNEX 3.1
Page 7 of 15
220MW capacity, will be implemented. Stage III provides for two new natural draught cooling
towers, and envisages installation of three additional cooling pumps to cater for the needs of unit 6
of Stage II and for the two additional units of Stage III. The cooling tower with 2 pumps is estimated
to cost US$4,804,000 in foreign exchange and Zim$25,1 10,000 in local costs. A construction period
of one year is considered sufficient. This is considered to be the cheapest option to ZESA is Stage
III is to be implemented, with a payback period for this investment of less than three months from
the above figures.
30.   The Auxiliary cooling water system utilizes water from the circulating cooling water system
for the cooling of the power plant equipment, primarily for the bearings, but also for other
equipment. The poor quality water in the CCW system has resulted in extensive scaling, silting and
general buildup of solids in the ACW circuits. The upgrade project proposes to replace the existing
system by a closed ACW system. Water is taken from the CCW main through a shell and tube,
water to water type of heat exchanger and circulates within a closed loop pipework system to ACW
users for cooling purposes. A header tank makes up for any water loss during the circulating
process. Chemical dosing at the header tank introduces a regulated flow of corrosion inhibitor
chemicals. A blowdown system, operated intermittently as required, limits the concentration of
impurities.
31.   The conceptual design considered for the ACW systems are three separate bearing cooling
water systems, one each for units 1 and 2, units 3 and 4, and units 5 and 6; and four separate
identical and interchangeable ACW systems are proposed as follows: one each for units 1 and 2, units
3 and 4, and for unit 5 and unit 6.
32.   The quality of the cooling water circulating in the system will be improved through the
introduction of a sidestream filter, prevention devices of debris ingress, and dosing of anti-scale and
corrosion inhibitor chemicals. Extra chlorine dosing devices will also be introduced in the circulating
cooling water system, and monitoring, recording and analysis equipment will be installed.
33.   In addition to the support to be provided for the implementation of the recommendation of
the T & A Consultants, the appraisal mission has agreed with ZESA to include the Stage I LP turbine
retrofitting in the Upgrade Program (Annex 3.2, page 5 of 9). The first unit has been retrofitted
under Power I loan. The major damage was found to be in the diaphragms and the inner casing of
the LP turbine. The causes for the damage to the diaphragms are: the erosion in the area of the
welded joints between the guide vanes and the inner and outer rings; the erosion between the axial
and radial guides of the diaphragms and the inner casings; and erosion of the cover rings resulting
in some separation of the caulked-in sealing strips. The erosion of the guide grooves and guide pins
which locate the diaphragms are the main causes for the damage to the inner casing. The retrofitting
of the remaining three units of Stage I, working under conditions of steam temperature identical to
that of LP turbine unit 1, is provided for under the Hwange Upgrade component of the proposed
project. One new complete set of diaphragms, upgraded by a more erosion-resistant material, and
one new inner casing will be purchased. The first of the three LP turbine units will be replaced by
the purchased set and the replaced set will be sent to the manufacturer's works for repairs. The
repaired set will then replace the diaphragms and the inner casing of the next set, and so on until all
the three units are retrofitted. The last repaired set of the diaphragms and inner casing will be kept

Page 8 of 15
in the power station as spare. This approach is evaluated to be the least cost, shortening the outage
time of a turbine during repair by 27 weeks (from 32 if repair is done on site to 3 weeks).
34.   The availability of units 5 and 6 is seriously hampered by different voltages of the two station
transformers (3.3 kV for station transformers 1 and 2 and 11 kV for station 3, the latter serving units
5 and 6). In the event of failure of station transformer 3, units 5 and 6 will be switched off by
consequential loss of auxiliary supplies. Both units will remain off the supply system until the station
transformer 3 is returned to service. The project provides an additional 30MVA 33/11 kV station
transformer to supplement transformer 3 for units 5 and 6.
35.   The two 554 kW emergency diesel generators were installed to serve Stage I. No additional
capacity was provided for Stage II, although the essential services load increased substantially.
ZESA will be transferring from one of its stations 3x1500 kW spare packaged units to provide the
additional capacity. The project will provide new transformers, switchboard and cables to directly
supply the essential services switchboard.
36.   The air conditioning equipment was undersized for Stage I due to higher ambient temperatures
than was provided for in the design. The project will refurbish the various systems presently out of
commission using replacement equipment of higher rating and with 100% standby plant.
37.   In addition, measures to reduce dust generation in the coal handling plant including

D. MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL WORKSHOPS
39.   ZESA has procured a large site near Harare for the construction of a main warehouse,
mechanical and electrical workshops including a garage, a transport and heavy items storage yard.
Construction by ZESA is in progress for the garage and a small part of the mechanical workshop.
The design of the remaining parts of the workshops has been completed, and bids received for some
of the priority workshops. ZESA's financial position rendered it difficult to proceed with the award
of contract. With the recent tariff adjustments and anticipated improvement in ZESA's financial
performance, construction is expected to start in some order of priority for the remaining parts of the
mechanical and electrical workshops.  Construction is expected to require about two years.
Workshop equipment to be procured under the proposed project include: gantry cranes of 5-100 ton
capacity, eccentric presses of about 20 ton capacity, hydraulic presses of 20 and 150 ton capacities,
milling and lathe machines, and a variety of tools and equipment which would enable ZESA fabricate
accessories for the distribution system and carry out repair and maintenance of mechanical parts
which are no longer supplied by the original manufacturers. A testing generator and testing
transformers, a high frequency furnace , a drying oven, and ancillary testing sets and equipment will
be procured for the electrical workshop. The workshop equipment and tools are listed in Annex 3.2,
page 7.
. VEIICLES
40.   There a total of 100 different type vehicles and 216 models from 27 different makers in
ZESA. The average age is excessive at 11.3 years, with 812 vehicles beyond their economic life.
The availability factor is 47% compared to a required normal average of about 80%. Based on the
recommendations of a consultant, ZESA has the objective of standardizing, to the extent possible,
vehicle types and has prepared a plan for the gradual replacement of old vehicles. This project will
replace about 25% of the vehicles beyond the economic life. The procurement list includes pick-ups
of various sizes, 4 wheel drives and standard passenger sedans mainly for distribution supervisory
and operating personnel at and between ZESA's operating sites. Augher vehicles are also needed for
the distribution system. Three 20-ton mobile cranes are needed to handle heavy equipment and cable
drums in the regions. In addition one DZ bulldozer will be purchased for ash disposal at the
Bulawayo power plant. The detail list of the vehicles and their quantity is given in Annex 3.2, page

F. MIS OPERATIONS
41.   Shortfall of Power II Loan One of the main objectives of the on-going MIS activities farming
part of Power II Loan is to develop a computerized MIS in the critical areas of Consumer
Information; Financial, Materials and Fleet Management; Human resources and application to
maintenance of the generation facilities. There is a shortfall in the Power II Loan to meet fully the
above objective. The proposed project aims at filling the shortfall by providing funds for the
following:
(i)    computer hardware facilities for Harare power station, Munyati power station,
Bulawayo power station and for transmission;



- 74 -
ANNEX 3.1
Page 10 of 15
(ii)   computer software for the above with the application in the fields of maintenance,
material management, human resources and budgetary management;
(iii)   computer hardware and software for the self-billing and self-accounting offices at
Marondera, Kadoma, Bindura, Masvingo, Chitungwize and KweKwe;
(iv)   purchase of a 4GL development platform; and
(v)    expert services of about 5 man-months for the above including the preparation of bid
and contract documents and provision for training.
42.   Computer-aided Cash ReceiDting. ZESA is taking over the collection activities of load
limited consumers, presently undertaken by respective Municipal Councils, in Bulawayo (81,800),
Harare (12,838) and Chitungwiza (13,881). There are 8 collection points in Bulawayo, 9 in Harare
and 3 in Chitungwiza. A computer hardware configuration coupled with application of software
would be required to replace the existing manual operations with computer-aided management of the
load limited consumers. It is estimated that 9 hardware configurations (consisting of 3 PCs acting
as 3 cash receipting stations, including a slip printer; one 24 pin 132 character wide matrix printer,
all with associated networking accessories) and 7 hardware configurations (consisting of 2 PCs acting
as 2 cash receipting stations, including printers and accessories as above).  The hardware
configuration would in addition have: the capability to operate with a minimum of two and a
maximum of 5 PCs at each collection point; provision for balancing and audit trail activities; and
transfer data for additional data security. The software application would, as a minimum, support
cash receipting (involving identification of consumers' point of supply, validating data entering the
computerized systems, recognizing mode of payment, issuance receipts to consumers, generating
reports on transactions daily and cumulatively), and record keeping (involving tariff classification and
rates including charges, fixed data on each consumer, disconnection and reconnection penalties, new
connection reporting, end of month reporting).
G. INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT
43.   Manpower Training. ZESA has established a Training Institute with teaching aids for
electricians and mechanics. Training experts would be brought to ZESA to increase the number of
staff to be trained in the areas of power plant and distribution system operation and maintenance.
The project provides funding for about 20 man-months for services by training experts. Provision
of about 540 man-months is also made for specialized training abroad of senior staff (including
postgraduate studies where warranted by the specific needs of ZESA) in the areas of power system
planning and operation of power utilities. The indicative training needs are given in Annex 3.2, page
9.
44.   Studies. The project provides 100 man-months for studies and expert services, on as-needed
basis, for ZESA's operations. The terms of reference for the studies or for the expert services will
be agreed upon with the Bank.

Supervision Plan
IBRD Supervision Input
1.    The timing for supervision and the staffweeks indicated in this Annex are tentative
and assume the loan will be declared effective in December 1993. They are therefore subject
to adjustment depending on the actual date of effectiveness. Normal headquarter activities on
procurement are also assumed to be carried out in parallel with the loan processing cycle
following the appraisal of the proposed project. The Annex does not include these
staffweeks, which are estimated to total at least eight staffweeks during the first year, and
seven staffweeks per year during subsequent years up to project completion.
Borrower's Supvision lnDt
2.    Quarterly reports, prepared in line with the Bank's requirements, are to be submitted
by ZESA following the project launch until project completion. Updated project costs,
including cost estimates to completion, financial statements and progress and performance data
will be prepared by ZESA prior to the arrival of supervision missions, in addition to any
specific requests that may be needed by visiting supervision missions. ZESA will, in
consultation with the visiting missions, prepare the Project Completion Report within six
months of project completion.

1992/93 - 1997/98
1.           Inflation and Exchange Rates. The following forecast inflation and exchange rates have
been used wherever stated in this annex.

2.           Sales and Revenues. Sales projections are based on load forecasts as per ZESA's System
Development Plan. Sales are forecast to decline in 1992/93 by 12.3% over the previous year; and
thereafter the annual growth is estimated at 6.3% in 1993/94 and 1994/95, 8.0% in 1995/96, 5.0% in
1996/97, and 4.0% in 1997/98. Sales revenue for 1992/93 is projected on the basis of existing tariffs.
Sales revenues for future years are based on increases in average tariff of 33% on September 1, 1993,
22.5% on July 1, 1994, 26.5% on July 1, 1996, and 2% on July 1, 1997. "Other" operating revenue
is assumed to increase in line with domestic inflation.
3.           Operating Expenses. Energy requirements, purchased and generated, are based on
ZESA's Generation Production Model within the overall System Development Plan. Cost of purchased
energy is provided on present agreed terms. Coal and diesel consumption for thermal generation is
estimated for each plant on the basis of forecast electricity output and the present average consumption
rate per unit of output. For Hwange, the consumption rate is scaled downwards from 1996/97 to take
account of anticipated efficiency gains resulting from planned upgrading and overhauls. Coal price is
assumed to increase in line with local inflation. The revised pricing structure, as notified by the Wankie
Colliery Company, for coal deliveries to Hwange has been applied from March 1, 1993. Diesel price
is assumed to increase in line with local and international inflation differential. Cost of chemicals and
maintenance and spares for power plants is forecast in total on the basis of 1991/92 actual cost per unit
of output, increased in line with local inflation, and future output. Provision for bad debts is maintained
throughout at 2.5% of closing trade debtors, in conformity with the policy adopted in 1991/92 financial
statements. All other operating costs, excluding depreciation and exchange losses, are assumed to
increase in line with local inflation.

ANNEX 4.5

4.            Deprecfiatin  Depreciation is provided in two parts: (a) historical cost is depreciated at
4.48% of the opening historical cost of fixed assets in service, in line with past historical average, and
(b) capitalised exchange losses arising on long term loans are depreciated over the remaining useful lives
of existing plants in service and over 25 years for new assets.
5.            Exchange Losses/Gains. Exchange losses arising on long term loans relating to the
acquisition of fixed assets are added/capitalised to work in progress or fixed assets on the basis that the
continuing depreciation,as forecast, of the Zimbabwe dollar is significant and considered to be permanent
and unlikely to be reversed. Such capitalised losses are depreciated as described above. Exchange losses
on trading transactions are projected to increase by Z$5 million each year. These losses, less exchange
gains arising on foreign currency deposits, are charged to income.
6.            Fixed Assets and Work in Progress. Capital investment is provided as per ZESA's
investment program. Provision is made for inflation and 10%  physical contingency. The foreign cost
component is converted to Z$ at the appropriate mid year exchange rates for the US$. Capital costs,
together with related interest during construction (DC) and capitalised exchange losses, are transferred
from work in progress to fixed assets in the year of commissioning of specific projects; and in the case
of on-going general distribution and transmission, capital costs are transferred in the year in which
incurred.
7.            Investments. Quoted investments and other investments, as discounted, are maintained
at the June 30, 1992 level throughout.
8.            Current Assets, Operating cash and bank balance is assumed to increase in line with
local inflation. Funds on deposit (all in foreign currency) are maintained at the June 30, 1992 level, and
adjusted for movements in year end exchange rates. Trade debtors are estimated at the present levels of
92 days' sales for 1992/93, 75 days' sales for 1993/94 and 1994/95, 65 days' sales for 1995/96, and 60
days' sales thereafter. Other debtors are assumed to increase in line with local inflation. Stores and
materials are assumed at 15% for 1992/93 and 14% thereafter of closing net book value of fixed assets.
9.            Current Liabilities. Bank overdraft and notes payable represent the financing gap which
is maintained at a reasonable level and set not to exceed Z$90 million (the balance at June 30, 1992).
Trade creditors are taken at two months' operating expenses, excluding depreciation and exchange losses.
Accrued interest is provided at three months' total interest. Provisions and other creditors are assumed
to increase in line with local inflation.
10.           Consumer Deposits. Consumer deposits are assumed to increase by 25% each year.
11.           Long Term Debt and Interest. Borrowing, repayments and interest on foreign currency
loans are translated at mid year exchange rates, and closing balances are stated at year end rates. The
following borrowing policy
has been adopted for new capital investment for which financing is not in place:
(a) Foreign currency requirements will be financed entirely by borrowing on normal
IBRD terms of repayments over 15 years, including 5 years' grace, with interest at 8 % per annum. The
grace period is reduced to the construction period of a project if it is of less than five years' duration.



- 103 -
ANNEX 4.5
Page 3 of 3
(b) Borrowing for local currency requirements for each project is restricted each year to
70% to 80% of total (foreign and local) capital cost less the Z$ value of borrowing secured for foreign
currency costs. The level of local currency borrowing each year is determined by the overall financing
gap. Local borrowing is assumed to be secured over medium term of 7 years, including 5 years' grace,
with variable interest rates, as forecast by ZESA, of 32.5% for 1992/93, 28% for 1993/94, 24.5% for
1994/95, 20.5% for 1995/96, and 18% thereafter.
Funding for capital projects with financing in place has been provided in accordance with
agreed terms.
Interest during construction (IDC) is capitalised and added to work in progress, from
which it is transferred to fixed assets on project commissioning. IDC is only calculated on specific
project related loans. Interest is not capitalised on borrowing for on-going work, such as general
distribution and transmission, and provision for support services such as motor vehicles.
Interest on bank overdraft, notes payable and discounted investments is provided at
ZESA's forecast rates for commercial bank rates of 27% for 1992/93 and 1993/94, 22.5% for 1994/95,
17.5% for 1995/96, and 15% thereafter.
Interest income on foreign currency deposits is provided at the present rate of 4.375%
throughout. Local interest income is assumed to increase in line with local inflation. Fixed interest
income on investments is maintained at the 1991/92 level throughout. Interest income is deducted from
interest charges in the income statement.

POWER III PROJECT
Economic Justification for the Hwange Power Station Upgrade Program
1.    MethQox
The output and reliability of Hwange Power Station have both be'en reduced by
design weaknesses that the Upgrade Program is designed to correct. To assess the comim
benefits of the Program, alternative availability rates for the power station (availability being the
percentage of the year the station's capacity is either generating or available, but in reserve) were
estimated for "with" and "without' program cases, based on a technical judgement of the station's
capability in the two situations. In the "with program' case, it was hypothesized that the station's
availability would be 73% in 1994 (the same as 1992) and would rise by 3% in 1995 and 4% in
1996 to a level of 80% and stabilize at this level through 2005, when the analysis was terminated.
In the "without program" case, it was hypothesized that availability would be the same as in the
*with programn case in 1994, then deteriorate by 2% per year over the remainder of the period.
Assuming the least-cost system development program is implemented, ZESA's System Production
Costing Model, which optimally despatches available supply to meet forecast demand, was run
over the period 1994-2005 for each of the two hypothetical availability rates to estimate the actual
output of Hwarge Power Station under the two availability scenarios. The resulting 'without
program" output of the station is shown in the first column of the table, the "with program"
output in the- second column and the net or differential output between the two scenarios in the
third column. The incremental output that the system requires from Hwange and can be achieved
with the improved availability is'771 GWh in 1995, when power supply is still constrained, then
falls marginally in 1996 and sharply in 1997, by when both of the interconnector projects are
scheduled to be in service. It then fluctuates at around 500 GWh/year until 2003, when it rises
sharply again as the supply situation becomes increasingly constrained. The incremental power
supply that will reach the consumer, and which constitutes the program benefits, is the
incremental output minus projected transmission and distribution losses. These are shown in
column four of the table. The analysis is conservatively terminated in 2005, although the benefits
will continue to be felt for many years beyond this.
2.           The benefits are valued at the most conservative measure of consumer willingness-
to-pay, the 1992/93 average tariff, which is Zcl7.5/kWh. At certain times, particularly in the
early years when supply is constrained and incremental output from Hwange will reduce unserved
energy demand, the value of the benefits will be a multiple of several times the tariff.
3.           The economic costs of the Upgrade Program are its estimated capital costs, with
the foreign costs adjusted for the scarcity value of foreign exchange by use of a 25% premium,
plus the incremental variable costs of producing the increased output, which include all scheduled
maintenance and overhauls and full provision of consumable inputs and spares.
4.            Based on these assumptions, the estimated economic rate of return of the Hwange
Upgrade Program is 13.5%. Given that the benefit valuation methodology certainly understates
the average value of the program benefits, the ex-post rate of return is likely to be substantially
higher.

POWER III PROJECT
Economic Justification of the Distribution Investments
Methodology
1.           The eleven distribution reinforcement/extension schemes included in the
project were selected from over forty candidate schemes designed and proposed by ZESA's
Area Offices, which are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the distribution
system and for proposing major investments in its rehabilitation, re-enforcement and extension
in their respective service areas. The candidate schemes were subjected to an economic
screening test by ZESA and Bank staff to identify those to be included in the project. The
economic benefit/cost ratio of each of the candidate schemes was estimated, using a discount
rate of 10%, over an assumed 15 year economic life of the new assets. Only schemes with an
estimated benefit/cost ratio greater than unity were selected. The economic rate of return of
each of the selected schemes was also estimated using the same cost and benefit assumptions
as in the benefit/cost ratio analysis. In the following paragraphs, the methodology and
assumptions used in the economic analysis are outlined and the results summarized in the
attached tables. Year-by-year estimates of the economic costs and benefits of each individual
distribution scheme are available on the project file.
Economic Costs
2.           The economic costs of each distribution scheme evaluated consist of the initial
capital costs of the investments and the yearly operations and maintenance costs. The design
of each candidate scheme was first optimized technically and the equipment to be installed
was specified. The equipment was then costed, either from recent tenders for the same
equipment or manufacturers' quotations. The financial cost of the foreign portion of the
equipment was then inflated by a standard conversion factor (scf) of 1.25, the estimated
shadow value of foreign exchange. The scf was derived from the current average premium for
foreign exchange on the secondary market that has been established as part of the Export
Retention Scheme. Operations and maintenance costs were estimated at 2% of capital costs.
Economic Benefits
3.           The economic benefits of each scheme consist of: (a) reduced distribution
losses due to the elimination of capacity constraints on the existing system; and (b)
incremental load growth projected for the relevant section of the distribution system which
could not be satisfied without the proposed investment. The kilowatthours currently being lost
due to inadequate capacity on the existing distribution system were calculated, based on the
technical characteristics of the system and existing demand data. The losses were then valued
at the existing tariff, on the basis that the costs of generating and transmitting the lost power
are sunk and its value to the consumer is at least equal to the tariff. The incremental load on
each of the distribution feeders in which investment was proposed was forecast based on the
average projected system load growth and any firm major new loads for which applications
had been received. These incremental sales were assumed to begin no sooner than 1996, when
the supply constraint will be alleviated, and were valued at Zc7/kWh, the difference between

the current average tariff and average bulk supply cost. These benefits were projected over 15
years, the average economic life of the assets.
Results of the Analysis
4.           The summary inputs and results of the analysis for the schemes that qualified
for inclusion in the project are shown in the following table. The individual schemes are
grouped into the ZESA Distribution Areas in which they are located. All the selected schemes
have estimated benefit/cost ratios of 1.1 or greater at a 10% discount rate and economic rates
of return in excess of 12%.

POWER HII PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return to the Power Plan III Investment Program
Methodogy
1.           The Power HI Project forms part of ZESA's larger Power Plan III, a package
of integrated investments to be made over the period 1994-98 that will expand the power
system to meet future demand for electricity at minimum economic cost. The Project, like
the Power Plan III Program, comprises a number of mutually-supportive components, which
when combined together and with the other elements of the Program, will allow the future
demand for power to be met reliably and at least cost. Although it is possible to identify
accurately the costs of the IBRD project that will contribute to Power Plan Im, it is not
possible to accurately disaggregate the benefits attributable to the IBRD project from those of
the overall system development program. The economic rate of return (ERR) analysis has
therefore been performed for the Power Plan III Program in its entirety.
Period of Analysis
2.           The economic rate of return is thus computed for a specific time slice of the
power investment program. The period begins with 1994, the year in which the first Power
Plan III investments will be made. Most of the capital costs of Power Plan III are projected
to be made in 1994, 1995 and 1996, but a few minor investments will spill over into 1997
and 1998. In order to capture both the short and medium-term benefits of the Program, the
benefit flows are estimated up to 2005. This is a conservative period, relative to the life of
the assets, but the benefits stream gets increasingly hard to estimate accurately in the longer
term. The year 2005 was selected as an appropriate cut-off point largely because it is the
approximate commissioning date of the next large-scale hydro-electric facility likely to be
added to the Zimbabwean system, which will have major impact on use of the facilities to be
constructed under Power Plan III.
Economic Costs
3.           The economic costs used for computing the economic rate of return are the
sum of the capital costs of the Power Plan III investments, measured in economic terms, and
the operating and maintenance costs of the incremental supply of power that those investments
will contribute to the system over the period of analysis. The capital costs are those
summarized in Annex 5.3. They are based on the estimated financial costs of the Power Plan
Im investments, converted into economic costs by use of a standard conversion factor of 1.25,
the average premium for foreign exchange on the secondary foreign exchange market at the
time of appraisal. The operations and maintenance costs were derived from ZESA's System
Production Costing Model, which is a model that was developed by ZESA's system planning
consultants to compare the economic cost of alternative development programs. The model
does this by simulating the despatch of the existing generating stations and import supplies
and alternative new sources of supply to meet the forecast demand for power at minumum
economic cost. Having first established that Power Plan III is the least cost option for the
next phase of system expansion, as described in Annex 2.5, the model identifies the output
required from each power station or interconnection, including those to be financed by Power

Plan Ill, and estimates the operations and maintenance cost of the supply from each individual
source. The operations and maintenance costs used in the ERR analysis are those of the two
interconnectors and the incremental output of Hwange Power Station that the project will
permit to be achieved. All costs are expressed in 1992 prices.
Economic Benefits
4.            The economic benefits are the incremental demands for power that will be met
by the investments included in the Power Plan III development program valued at the
economic worth of that incremental demand. In 1994 and 1995, and perhaps for part of
1996, until the first of the planned interconnectors with South Africa and Mozainbique is in
service, that incremental demand will be supplied from Hwange Power Station. Without the
higher Hwange availability and capacity benefits of the project, much of this incremental
demand would be unserved, at high economic cost to Zimbabwe. From 1996, and until
Hwange Stage III or an alternative new source of supply is available, which is projected to be
the early years of next century, the incremental demand will be met largely by the two
interconnectors. Hwange III will then share that role until the planned Batoka hydro-electric
scheme is in service, which is projected to be 2004. Should Hwange III and/or Batoka or be
delayed, which is very probable, the roles of Hwange I and II and the two interconnectors in
meeting demand will be correspondingly greater than projected and the benefits stream
consequently larger.
5.            The value of the economic benefits is based on the most conservative method
of estimating consumers willingness-to-pay for electricity, which is the atual tariff. The
FY92193 average tariff of Zcl7/kWh (about USc3/kWh) is used in the computation. The true
willingness to pay is certainly higher than the tariff, for large commercial consumers,
considerably higher. This valuation methodology therefore certainly understates the actual
economic benefits of the Power Plan III Investment Program. Using this valuation method,
the estimated economic rate of return of the power investment program is 26.7%. A
summary of the data used in reaching this estimate is given in the attached table.
Risk Analysis
6.            There is a risk that this rate of return will not be realized. However, given
that most of the capital equipment to be installed under the program is of a standard type and
the installation engineering required is relatively simple, the risk that the capital costs of the
program have been significantly understated is considered to be negligible. Similarly, given
that that the incremental operating and maintenance costs are derived from ZESA's production
costing model, the risk that they are seriously over or under-estimated is also considered to be
slight. There is a risk that the growth in demand, and hence the incremental demand that the
program will satisfy, have been over-estimated, as has occurred with a significant proportion
of power projects in the past. This risk is reduced by the relatively conservative demand
growth rate projection used, which is marginally below the historical average; by the fact that
there is considerable suppressed demand for power, which a major transmission and
distribution expansion program is presently helping to alleviate; and by the fact that the ESAP
is well advanced and its benefits should be felt strongly over the reference period. Potentially
counterbalancing these positive factors, at least to some degree, power tariffs have recently
been increased in real terms and will increase further as full economic pricing is introduced.
Consumers have also been forced to re-assess their consumption of power over the past year

due to the drought-induced shortage of supply. Given the uncertainty over the demand
forecast, the switching value for projected demand at which the ERR would fall to 10%, the
estimated opportunity cost of capital, was calculated. This analysis showed that the demand
projection would need to over-estimate demand growth by 53% for the ERR to fall to 10%.
This outcome would requiring a major and sustained economic collapse and average economic
growth in the 1990s well below the modest rate of 3% achieved in the 1980s. It is considered
that the probability of this outcome is extremely low, and that the project is therefore
economically justified under all probable conditions.
