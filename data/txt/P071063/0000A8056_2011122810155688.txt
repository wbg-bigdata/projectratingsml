                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has taken a number of actions to move forward with the implementation of Treasury Management Information System and Human Resource
                         Management Information System (TMIS/HRMIS) contract, as well as completed stage two of implementation of the contract with ALSI on installation of field hardware and network
                         equipment, and building of infrastructure system. To facilitate the finalization of the system requirements for TMIS/HRMIS, the MOF has hired an international consultant and two
                         national consultants to finalize the Unified Chart of Accounts. The company “International Business Systems? (in the Russian Federation) has developed detailed functional

                         major improvement in the management of budget execution and will enable the efficient cash management, and enhance a greater degree of transparency, etc. The MOF has revised
                         the project management arrangements, which was approved by the Government order. The MOF management initiated a financial and IT audit of the state entity InfoSystem, which
                         was created to support MOF system automation needs. While the financial audit has not revealed any substantial issues, the audit of information systems revealed a number of

                         weaknesses relate to information security. The MoF has developed an action plan to address those issues/weaknesses and has started to implement them already. The Treasury
                         published monthly budget execution reports on its website in a transparent manner. Successful and timely project implementation requires a more coordinated and rigorous effort of
                         all key MOF managers. In order to strengthen the Bank’s continuous support to project implementation, the Task Team Leader (TTL) moved from the Bank’s Head Quarters
                         (Washington, DC) to the Bishkek Country Office.
