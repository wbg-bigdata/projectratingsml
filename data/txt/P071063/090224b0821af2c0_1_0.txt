                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the last ISR for the GTAC project, now in its 11th year and closing on December 31, 2013. Originally designed to provide support for reforms under a Development Policy
                         Operation (DPO), the Governance Structural Adjustment Credit (GSAC), the project had two substantive components and a project management component. Activities under the
                         first component, Technical Assistance to Support Reforms Under GSAC, largely ended by the fifth year of the project. The second component, Treasury Modernization, was
                         intended to finance increased automation of key elements of financial management, treasury operations and payroll and personnel management. Automation of budget preparation

                         also became a third element of automation. These three automation elements collectively were to be part of the implementation of a Financial Management Information System
                         (FMIS).
                         The first component of the program supported a variety of human resource management, and administrative reforms as well as reforms to increase transparency in the use of public
                         funds. A significant emphasis was on professionalizing management of the civil service and increasing the meritocratic elements of the public sector workforce. Accomplishments

                         include support to the establishment of a civil service agency, the State Personnel Service (SPS), an increase in the placement of senior officials based on competitive merit-based
                         processes, and financial disclosure of senior public officials. This component has yielded outcomes that have proved to be sustainable since project support ended.
                         The core of the second component was the acquisition and implementation of the FMIS referenced above. This component proved to be problematic from its origins as evidenced
                         by the fact that a tender for acquisition of the system did not occur until four years into the project. The first tender was canceled due to the fact that prices offered by acceptable
                         bidders exceeded the budget, a re-tender occurred and a contract was not signed until almost six years after the project started, well after the originally scheduled closing date.
                         Post contract implementation of the system proved to be equally troubled. Significant disagreements between the Government and its FMIS vendor about required functionality of
                         the three components resulted in lengthy delays and changes in leadership on both sides occurred since contract signing. On the Government side, there were multiple changes in
                         the position of Project Director, the key position of Director of the Treasury, and changes in the position of Minister. On the vendor side, there were multiple changes in project
                         management staff with frequent turnover in local staff and key project management, developer, and senior management positions.
                         In the beginning of 2013, a detailed action plan was developed and agreed by both the Government and its vendor outlining necessary steps for full implementation. Despite an
                         improved focus by all parties on making progress on the plan, slippage occurred and key events did not take place as the project closing date approached. The Government notified
                         the Bank on December 16 that it had elected to cancel the credit amount of the project that has not been disbursed, approximately $2.5 million and the Bank agreed to this request.
                         Accordingly, the amount of funding allocated to the treasury modernization component was reduced by more than 50%.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government notified the Bank on December 16 that it had elected to cancel the credit amount of the project that has not been disbursed, approximately $2.5 million and the Bank
                         agreed to this request. Accordingly, the amount of funding allocated to the treasury modernization component was reduced by more than 50%.
