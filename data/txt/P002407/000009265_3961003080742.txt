MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEDATION O'P THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE              DIECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE FOR A
ROAD REHUARAJO  AND MAITEANCEPROJECr
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Rqeublic of Siefra Leone for SDR 32.0 million, the equivalent of
US$45 million, on standard IDA terms with a atryof 40 years to help f ce a road
rehabilitation and maintnce project. The project is expected to be cofivanced by UNDP
(US$5.69 million), lICA (UJS$5.00 million), EC (US$11.85 million) and Afl)B (US$14.35
million).
2.    Backgiound. Sierra Leone is a small country with a relatively simple transport system
which prinuaily consists of the road network. Its railway was closed in 1973; there is little
inland air or water transport; and it has an intenational airport and a port at Freetown. The
country has about 1,300 kms of paved roads, and 10,000 kms of unpaved roads including
about 4,200 kms of rural feeder roads. The road network is in a state of near collapse due to
prolonged lack of maintean; a good part of the network needs heavy rehablitation or
recnruction while the remaining part needs immdiate preventive mainteance. Farming
activies, marketing, and exports, all suffer due to the bottlenecks in the road system.
3.    Most of the past failures in the road system occurred due to inadequate Government
fwding (meeting only about 5% of maienance needs), and due to weak instions; road
mnanagement was the responsibility of the large Ministry of Works (recently renamed as
Department of Works (DOW)) which had multiple functions, with inadequate atontion and
resoures for road maintenace. Since 1989, GOSL has launched, with interational support,
a structura adjustment and economic recovery program, with changes from past policies,
focussing on crticat reforms in policies, institutions, financia management and budgetig,
icludIng reforms in the road sector. Governm  has realized that removing the physical
how lime", particuarly through road rehabilitation, is the key to producing the supply
response expected from macro-econoz-Uc policies. GOSL has therefre requested fnancial
assistance from IDA and other intational agencies to support its program for road and
oter t port rehabiitation and for strengthening related instituions.
4.    Government has aleady taken, during 1989-92, up-front actions in: (a) setting up a
semi-autonomous Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA) to take charge of the road sub-sector
for which an Act was passed by Parliament on February 27, 1992, with its Board and
Director General appointed in August 1992, and for which other actions to make it fully
operational by March 1993 are in progress; (b) establishing a Road Fund dedicated to reguiar
road maintenance and fiuded from road user levies, collected in addition to the fuel tax; and
(c) ral  road useharges sufficiently (thrugh a 100% increase in fud price to about
US$1.80 per imperial gallon) to recover finds adequate to maintain the total networl.  hese
meaures will Improve sector mangement and help prevent a recurrence of the falure of past
investments in the road sector. However, the Government requires (a) urgent financa
suwort for capital works in road rehabilitation and deferred m tenance for which a swven-
year program is envisaged; and (6) technical assistance and other support for planning,
supervision, and institutional strengtening and capacity building of the SLRA to improve
road sector and maintenance management.



2
S.    Pric Objec . The main objectives of the project are: (a) to remove physical
bottlenecks in the country's tsport network, in order to promote supply response from the
economic recovery program, hough a sustainable road rehabilitatlon and maintenance
program; (b) to bufld institutional capacity to better plan and manage the repair and
maintenance of roads, and promoting a sustainable system for fimding road maineance;
(c) to strengthen taport sector institutions to improve sector management, planning and to
foster market-oriented policies; (d) to encourage new methods of infrastructure rehabilitation
and maintennce, using appropriate labor-intensive technology and local resources, in order to
nrease emplo)ment generation and to provide sustainable maintenance systems; (e) to
increase the share of private sector participation in road maintenance, and develop capacity of
small-sized contractors to maintain the road network; and (f) to promote the use of non-
motorized transport (NMT) to reduce headloading by women and to increase rural mobility,
improving transport services available for the rural poor. During implementation the
achievement of project objectives and physical targPets will be monitored using appropriate
performance indicators already agreed with the Borrower during negotions.
6.    Pro  Desc       . The main project components are: (a) road rehabilitation and
maintenance, covering the first four-year time slice of a seven-year program to catch up with
past maintenance and rehabilitation backlogs, covering rehabilition of about 490 kms of
runk roads and 20 kms of city toads in the Freetown Central Business District, and
maintenaince/repaw of 2800 knms of trunk roads (77.2% of total project costs); (b) strengthen-
Ing road maintenance institutions by supporting the new SLRA through technical assistance,
rain, essental minte  equipment and logistical support (15%); (c) office equipment,
and ficilities to support DOW (.3%); (d) supporting the Deparnt of Transport,
Communications and Tourism to improve tansport planning and policies through technical
a;ssistance, trang and key sector studies (.6%); (e) assisting communities, through NGOs, to
increase the use of low-cost non-motrized transport (NMI) (mainly bicycles and bicycle-
trailers) to improvwe tansport services for the poor (.9%); and (t) technical assistance for
project design and supervision (6%). Schedule A gives the summary of estimated costs and
financn plan. The amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as the
estimated disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map of Sierra Leone is also attached. The staff Appraisal Report No. 11175-
SL, dated November 25, 1992 is being distributed separately.
7.    P. The project cost is esdmated at US$92.74 million equivalent, of
which US$74.68 million is in foreign costs. The following financing p'an is expected: IDA
US$45.0 million; African Development Bank US$14.35 million; European Community
US$11.85 million; Japan (JICA) US$5.0 million; UNDP US$5.69 million; and Government
of Sierra Leone US$10.85 million equivalent Cofinancing arrangements are in progress, and
are expected to be finalized by June 1993. The road componen  are discrete items and any
delay in their cofinancing arrangements will not adversely affect the IDA-funded cmponents.
The main Jointy-fuded component is instittional and logistical support to SLRA which is
expected to be financed by IDA, EC and UNDP. EC and UNDP have already provided some
intial inputs, and their formal commitment to finance the remaining inputs to these
ponents is to be obtined by Government by January 1993.
8. Project Implemeno. MmThe project will be managed and coordinated by the SIRA,
assisted by a team of experts, including a project coordinator. Training of local contracors
will be achieved in collaboration with ILO. The Freetown roads component will be



3
implemented by the SLRA In consultation with Freetown City Council whose capacity will be
built up under the project. Selected NGOs, mainly Plan Internatonal, an internationa NGO
In Sierra Leone, wi Implement the component on support to loca communities for NMT,
under SLRIA coordination. lhe Depatment of TranspoRt, Commnications and Tourism will
implement the transport sector planning and studies component In coordination with SLRA.
Project preparation is well advanced with detailed engineering for road works recendy
completed under a Japanese Grant and PPF Advance. Bids for major wotks are planned to be
invited in January 1993, and award of main contracts expected in June 1993.
9.    Pjt Sustainabir. Improved orgizational structure, assured funding and greater
involvement of the private sector for road maintenance are the three key factors that are being
addressed by the project to enhance sustainaility. The SLRA has been set-up and a Road
Fund has been established, funded from road user levies. The project will further strengthen
the Roads Authority and help ensure regular flow of funds for maintenance. The development
and taining of domestic contractors and promotion of labor-intensive technology wiUl enhance
efficiency, sustainabiity and the cost-effectiveness of road maintenance operations in the
future.
10.   Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. Bank has finamced only two operations in
the roads sector in the past. The First Highway Project (1971) involved mainly the
construction of new roads, while the Second Highway Prtoject (1981) focused on rehabilitation
and maintenance of 800 km of trunk roads. Two types of problems affected performance and
caused partial failure of these projects: weak institutions and inadequate funding for
Govermnent counerpart expenditure and for follow-up maintenance. The proposed project
and its funding and imple tion aements (establishing and strengthening of the semi-
autonomous roads authority, Road Fund, and maintenance by contract) are designed to
prevent a recurrence of these problems (paras 9 and 12).
11.   Ri    fgr IDA             . The project will strengthen the country's economic
recovery progam, which IDA is supporting through a Reconstuction Import Credit (RIC),
Credit No. 2352-SL, which became effective on April 15, 1992. The country strategy
recognized that imprement in the condition of the road network is crucial to economic
recovery and development. The transport sector needs support from many external donors,
and the proposed project would provide a basis for agreement on investment priorities. It
would also play a catalytic role In attracting cofinancing. The proposed project is, therefore,
flly consiste  with the Country Asistance Strategy discussed by the Board in April 1992.
12.    Aed Actions As noted, Government has already taken actions during the
preparation of the project in reorganizing road sector institutions, making appropriate
management and finding arrangements, through the establishment of the SLRA, setting up a
Road Fund with assured flow of funds and raising road user charges to adequate levels.
Major macroeconomic policy changes and public enterprise reforms have been agreed under
the RIC. D       e g    _ further agreemens were obtaied from Government and SLRA
on the folowing key items: (a) to ensure a smooth flow of a core level of funds to the
project and to the maitenan  program, the share of the collected road user charges would be
automatically assigned on a weekly basis to the Road Fund in the form of a Road Fund fee,
and its value would be maintained in real tems (n December 1992 prices), at the level of at
leat 20 US cents equivalent per imperial gallon of gasoline and diesel up to December 1998;
(b) agreed amounts would be provided to SLRA every quarter, (amounts were agreed during
negotations and would be reviewed annually in April/May), as topping up from budget, to



4
spplement the Road Fund to adequately cover al road mintenance, rehabiitatlio and SL;RA
recurrent expediture; (c) an adequate level of recovery of road user charges to meet ftis
maintenCOe needs (estfmated at US$20 million in 1992 costs) would be maintine; (d) six
monthly fcial and work verification audits of Road Fund and other SLRA funds would be
conducted by Independent auditors acceptable to IMA; (e) guidelines for use of Road Fund
prceeds will be agreed before January 31, 1993; (t) the share of road maintenance through
pdve contracting would be progressively increased to at least 50% by 1996; (g) studies to
review functionslreorganization of the Road Transport Corporation (RTC) would be
conducted by June 30, 1994, and reviewed with IDA before September 30, 1994, and agreed
actions would be implemented according to an agreed schedule; (h) annual transport sector
investment would be agreed with IDA, and IDA would be consulted on any Pew transport
projects cosdng individually more than US$3 million outside the agreed plan; (i) SLRA wil
appoint by March 31, 1993, on its staff, an engineer in charge of assessing and monitoring
environmenal lmpac f road projects; d) Government will obta by January 31, 1993,
letters of commitmentitent from EC and UNDP to finance technical assisteace to SLIA; and
(k) a mid-term review of the project would be conducted before June 30, 1995. Conditions
for credit effectvns include: (a) completion of key appointments (Department Heads and
250 staf, including appointment of chief financial adviser and accountant; (b) appointmen of
exteral auditors to audit the accou  and works under the Road Fund and other SLRA fumds
from July 1992 to June 1993; (c) appointment of a project coordinator, and of engineering
consultants for supervision of works; and (d) payment of an initial amount of Leones 200
million into the ProjAc Account
174 .   EwfiuPnme nw AMM. Since the project consists mainly of rehabiliat  exisng
romIs, there are no major concerns for environmental impacts. Potential concerns Involve
temporary disruPti  during constuction, improper revegetaton of embakments and borrow
pits, and soil erosion and gdly formaions resulting from poor design of drainage. These
aspects are being taken into consideration during the design and construction phase of the
rehabilitation works, and a midgation plan has been agreed. Positve environmental effects
are epected to result from improveme in city street drainage and traffic flows. An
evionmental          has been completed recendy (Category B). To enhance institonal
capacity for dealing with roads related environmental issues, the project will support training
of an SLJRA engineer in environmental impact studies and help establish an enironmental unit
within SLRA.
14.   Progm OWective Ceg s The whole project would help reduce poverty by
Imrving tanort services for people and goods, and components (c) and (e) (para 6), in
particlar wil help improve employment and incom3 of the poore sections of society and
women. In addition, the project would contibute to development of the private sector in road
construction and mainenance through training of domestic conactors and through incresing
the share of road works undern by contrc.
15.      jet Bofits and Risks. The main benefit from ihe project would be a more
efficient and ost-effective hihway sector that permits a higher level of economic activity.
Economic returns for individual road improvements are esmated to range between 18-98%,
and the composite weighted average ERR for all project components is 30%. A 10% incase
in project cos or a 10% decrease in benefits would reduce the ERR to about 27% i each
ce. Ihe main rik is a repettion of the Govemets past faure In prov g regular
couxQn    funding and adequat project management. These risks have been mimized by
(a) settig up a semi-autonomous SLRA to manage the road sector in gene  and such



S
projecs in partialar, and (b) legislation seting up a Road Fund and the increase In fuel taxes
which should provide reguiar fAdig from the point of collection to the Road Fund account.
The propose provision of tehnical assistance and training to SLRA will help build up a
strong proiect management capacity. However, a thorough supervision and monitoring of
ptoject progress iS called for, and will be provided.
16.   Recoendao. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

Between 1964 and 1987, there were 19 projects (5 Bank and 14 IDA) amounting to US$128
millon. Four parially disbursed Credits (amounting to a total of about US$46 million) were
suspended in 1987 when Sierra Leone went into non accrual status. After the Government cleared its
arrears to the Bank in April this year and the Reconstruction Import Credit (Cr. No. 2352-SL)
became effective, suspension for all four projects was lifted and disburements under the projects have
resumed. The Agricuualn Sector Support Project is being modified in consultation with the
government to address the changing priorities in the sector, in acoordance with the Bank's policies.
Disbursements under a Power Sector Engieaing Credit are being made to support the emergency
rehabilitation program assisted by EC and Geman aid as a presor to the IDA Power Sector
Rehabilitation Project approved at the end of April 1992 (Cr. No. 2356-SL). Disburs and
implementatio under the Reconstruction Import Credit (Cr. 2352-SL) have been sasactoy. There
have been no significant problems in stating procurement and disbursement under the ongoing
projects since the trumption of disbrsements.
