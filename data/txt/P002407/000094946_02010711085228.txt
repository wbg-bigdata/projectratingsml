3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The objectives of the Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (RRMP), as stated in the SAR, were to
assist the Borrower: (a) to remove physical bottlenecks in the country's transport network, in order to
promote a supply response from the economic recovery program through a sustainable road rehabilitation
program; (b) to build institutional capacity to better plan and manage the repair and maintenance of roads
and promote a sustainable system for funding and road maintenance; (c) to strengthen transport sector
institutions to improve sector management and planning and to foster market-oriented policies; (d) to
encourage new methods of infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance, using labor intensive technology
and local resources, in order to increase employment generation and to provide sustainable maintenance
systems; (e) to increase the share of private sector participation in road maintenance and develop capacity
of small contractors to maintain the road network; and (f) to promote the use of non-motorized transport
(NMT) to reduce head-loading by women and to increase rural mobility, improving transport services
available for the rural poor.
These objectives were consistent with the Govemment of Sierra Leone's strategy for economic recovery and
the structural adjustment program that was being supported by IDA and other donors at the time. In
December 1989 the government had embarked on a comprehensive package of economic reform which it
was successfully implementing. IDA supported the government's structural adjustment and economic
recovery program through a Reconstruction Import Credit (RIC) which was approved in early 1992. This
was intended to restore the government's capacity to provide essential services and to manage economic
reforms. The Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (RRMP) and an energy project were also
approved in 1992 to help produce a supply response.
The proposed project was also consistent with the governnent's sector strategy, supported by IDA and
other donors, to improve the road network condition through well-focussed efforts under a seven-year road
reconstruction and rehabilitation program. This strategy involved clearing the backlog of maintenance to
restore the road network to its original capacity with limited upgrading where essential and the concurrent
initiation of an efficient maintenance system with an improved organization and assured funding.
Objectives (b) through (e) were related to organizational, financial and procedural reforms in the
roads sector. This reform program was already underway during project preparation and at
appraisal. Further progress in achieving it was made before project effectiveness. These
objectives involving improved institutional capacity, maintenance efficiency and private sector
participation were being pursued through conditions of effectiveness and technical assistance. In
early 1992 the semi-independent Sierra Leone Road Authority (SLRA) had been established and
the government agreed to retrench excess staff who had been transferred from the Department of
Works (DOW). It was agreed that SLRA would gradually assign maintenance to private
contractors instead of using direct force account. A Road Fund, which had been established in
1990, was incorporated into SLRA. It was financed mainly from a levy on fuel and vehicle
licensing and registration fees. Its levies and budget allocations were increased before the project
to pay for road maintenance. The commencement of SLRA with essential staff and resources was
a condition effectiveness. The government also aimed to expand and restructure the domestic
construction industry. The intention was to encourage small, labor-intensive micro firms capable
of managing small road maintenance contracts. These were important objectives, which drew on
experience from many other countries in Africa where road rehabilitation and maintenance had not
been successful without fundamental changes in organization, financing and contracting
- 2 -



procedures.
Objective (f), to promote the use of non-motorized transport (NMT) to reduce head loading by women and
to increase rural mobility for the rural poor, was targeted at the low income rural population and based on
successful experience elsewhere in West Africa.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives of the Project did not change during implementation. The project was not
reconstituted with revised objectives after the suspension of country operations in 1998 and 1999.
This was because the institutional development objectives were largely being met (see section 4.5)
and most of the funds for road rehabilitation and maintenance had been spent, some of which was
to reimburse contractors for canceled contracts. It was also not considered necessary because
further institutional support and funding for road rehabilitation and maintenance were being
provided under the Transport Sector Project (Credit 2895-SL - See section 3.4).
3.3 Original Components:
The credit supported a four-year time slice of the government's seven-year program to reduce the backlog
of reconstruction, rehabilitation and maintenance on the trunk roads, major city streets and feeder roads in
the country. Specifically, the components were:
Trunk Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance: (i) rehabilitation and strengthening of about 357 km of
paved and 136 km of gravel roads in the trunk road network; (ii) improvement of the Central Business
District (CBD) of Freetown, through rehabilitation and main roads (20 km); and (iii) maintenance of trunk
roads by contract including support for developing small-sized local contractors, and for the use of
labor-intensive technology.
Strengthening of Road Management Institutions: (i) technical assistance to help organize, manage and train
SLRA and its staff, and train domestic contractors; (ii) training of SLRA staff at local institutions and
overseas; (iii) maintenance equipment, spares and vehicles for a limited amount of force account capability
in SLRA for road maintenance; and (iv) provision of office facilities and other logistical support for SLRA.
Support to Department of Works (DOW): Office equipment and facilities.
Support to Transport Sector Institutions: Technical assistance, training and office equipment for the
Department of Transport, Conmmunications and Tourism (DTC) to improve sector planning and policies,
and for key studies.
Pilot Program for Promotion of Non-Motorized Transport (NMT): Support for the development of NMT in
the rural areas including assistance to NGOs.
The components were appropriate for meeting the objectives. The trunk road rehabilitation and
maintenance program was intended to have the inimediate effect of relieving major physical bottlenecks in
the country's transportation network and thus contributing to the desired supply response of the economy.
The technical support for the reformed sector institutional structure was important to ensure that the
substantial institutional and road financing reforms begun during project preparation would be continued
and consolidated during the project period.
The total cost of the project was estimated at US$ 92.74 million, of which IDA was to provide US$ 45
- 3 -



million, GOSL to provide US$10.85 million and five other donors were to provide the balance in parallel
financing.
3.4 Revised Components:
Trunk road rehabilitation and maintenance had to be modified during the project period because of the
security situation in the country. In 1995 the quarry of the contractor engaged with the rehabilitation of the
Taiama-Bo-Kenema road was attacked, and the contract was suspended. Rehabilitation of the
Kissy-Wellington Road and the Freetown CBD streets continued.
Non-Motorized Transport (NMT) got off to a slow start with difficulties regarding the delivery of bicycle
towed trailers. In 1995, because of security issues the focus of this component was shifted to the Westem
and Lungi areas and Freetown.
Although not a revision to this project, IDA provided further support to this sector during the project
period. In 1996, IDA approved a Transport Sector Project (Credit 2895-SL) which focused, in
coordination with other donors, more broadly on all modes of transportation, but which included further
road rehabilitation, reconstruction and maintenance. It also provided further funding for the development
of small and medium contractors, for technical assistance to SLRA, and to expand the SLRA training
school and training program.
3.5 Quality at Enny:
The main physical components were designed during project preparation. Detailed engineering and bid
documentation for the selected roads had been substantially prepared by appraisal, funded under a previous
highway project. In addition, TORs for studies under the DTC and a list of equipment to be procured for
DOW and DTC had been prepared. Implementation details for the NMT component had also been
prepared.
Important institutional reforms were taken before and at the beginning of the project. These included
passing the Sierra Leone Road Authority (SLRA) Act and launching the SLRA as a semi-independent
organization. The Road Fund, dedicated to road maintenance and funded from road user charges collected
as part of the fuel tax, was set up in 1990 by a cabinet decision and was incorporated into the SLRA Act.
The Road Fuel levy and the petroleum price were raised. As a result, the road user charge collection was
US$22 million equivalent, as against an estimated US$20 million needed for both periodic and routine
maintenance of the total network. Covenants in the Credit Agreement ensured that the Road Fund and
Govenmment budgetary releases would be adequate and would flow regularly. Quality and entry is rated
satisfactory.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The objective of removing physical bottlenecks in the country's transport network was only partially met
due to the deteriorating security situation during the project period (see section 4.2). During 1998 and
1999 there was very little progress on any part of the project due to the security situation in Sierra Leone.
During this period the project was rated Unsatisfactory for Development Objectives (see section 5.1).
The second set of objectives related to organizational, financial and procedural reforms in the roads sector
were achieved to a large extent in spite of the security situation. The transfer of responsibility from the
Department of Works to the Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA) has improved the management of the
road network. The assistance provided for training, engineering design, and contract supervision has
helped the contract management capability of the SLRA staff. A computerized Road Maintenance
- 4 -



Management System has been established by SLRA to enhance its ability to prioritize road maintenance
works. SLRA staff has also received domestic and overseas training under this project and is now capable
of administering major contracts independently. The Road Fund, which was established before the project
period and was intended to provide financing for road maintenance, met its objective during the early
project period. However, at the end of the project its allocations were only 47 per cent of its projected
target at appraisal due to economic and logistical problems related to the security situation. Important
steps were taken during the project period to improve maintenance by contractors (see Section 4.2)
Very little progress was made in establishing non-motorized transport systems due to the security situation.
Although the project could not meet all its objectives because of the security situation, physical
improvements were achieved on some road sections. More importantly, there have been substantial
institutional improvements, which can contribute to future efforts to finance and maintain the road network
in Sierra Leone. On balance, therefore, outcome under the project is rated satisfactory.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Trunk Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance. This involved the rehabilitation and strengthening of
about 357 km. of paved and 136 km.of gravel roads in the trunk road network. Work on the
rehabilitation of the Taiama-Bo-Kenema trunk road could not be finished (only 72 km of the planned 121
km were completed at the end of the project). Due to security reasons it was decided to terminate that
contract. Work continued on the Clinetown-Wellington Road and on periodic and routine maintenance.
Equipment was provided under the project for periodic and routine maintenance of national roads.
Although the work on rehabilitation was disrupted to varying degrees by the security problems it did meet
with limited success. Improved maintenance practices brought the share of the road network in good
condition from 10% to over 30% and the share of the network in fair condition has risen from 20% to over
30%.
The rehabilitation of the main roads (15.8 km) in Freetown was completed. The completion of
street rehabilitation in the Central Business District and rehabilitation of the Clinetown-Wellington
Highway has helped solve the major problem of conflict between traffic flow and pedestrian activity. All
rehabilitated streets have been provided with sidewalks and curbs, which separates carriageways and
pedestrian walkways. This has improved the safety of pedestrians and reduced accidents in the city.
Efforts to improve maintenance by small local contractors have progressed. There has been an appreciable
increase in labor based and machine based maintenance and pothole patching by private contractors.
Strengthening of Road Management Institutions. Technical assistance was provided to help organize,
manage and train SLRA staff and to train domestic contractors. The project began with 10 staff at SLRA
and ended with 507. Training programs were carried out for SLRA staff at local institutions and overseas.
SLRA staff received 266 man-months of domestic and 38 man-months of overseas training. This training
helped SLRA to be able to administer all of its major contracts. At the mid-term review in 1996 SLRA
was considered to be able to administer 100% of its contracts independently. However, there is continued
scope for improvement in financial record keeping at SLRA.
Maintenance equipment, spare parts and vehicles were provided to SLRA to give it a limited capacity to
carry out road maintenance through force account. This included the purchase of road maintenance and
workshop equipment, tools and spare parts. Office facilities and other logistical support were provided for
SLRA. IDA financed the second phase of the SLRA building (wiring, air conditioning and furnishing
costs).
-5 -



The project provided training and institutional strengthening to the private contracting industry in Sierra
Leone. At the beginning of the project there were only 20 small contractors and no single-man contractors.
By the conclusion of the project there were 57 labor/light equipment based contractors trained and
undertaking 30% of the periodic maintenance, 50% of the mechanized routine maintenance and 100% of
pothole patching by contract. The number of single-man contractors grew to 540.
Support to Transport Sector Institutions. During the project period in 1996 a Transport Sector Project was
approved. A Transport Sector Study was undertaken and the new project has followed up on broader
institutional development matters in the transport sector, including the roads sector.
Promoting Non-Motorized Transport in Rural Areas. This component could not be implemented due to the
security situation in the country.
4.3 Net Presenit Value/Economic rate of return:
At appraisal an ERR was computed separately for each road section in the SAR using the HDM III model.
These varied from 18% to over 90% on the selected road sections, including the Freetown roads. The
weighted average ERR for the roads component was 34%. The overall ERR for the project was 30%. Due
to security risks, it was not possible to collect comprehensive traffic data to measure the ex-post economic
impact of the roads components. On Freetown streets, where traffic might have been measured, there were
security risks and the streets were too congested with refugees from the civil war. The initial estimate of
the ERR for Freetown roads had been 98%, so it is likely that this component of the Project has yielded an
acceptable economic retum, even with the 31% increase in construction costs caused by additional drainage
and traffic management measures. For the Cline Town - Wellington Highway the ERR is 43.4%. A large
expenditure was made for the rehabilitation of the Taiama-Bo-Kenema trunk road to settle the payments to
the contractor when the contract was canceled. Only 72 kilometers of the planned 121 kilometers had been
completed. It is likely, therefore that this component had a negative rate of return that would also have
reduced the overall average rate of return for the project to a negative value. (For details see Annex 3).
4.4 minancial rate of return:
The financial rate of return could not be calculated as no data was available.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project's institutional development impact was high. The transfer of responsibility for road investment
and maintenance from the Department of Works to the SLRA has brought significant improvements in road
management. The performance of the borrower has improved, irregularities have been eliminated,
equipment is being properly used, and the SLRA has improved its capability to supervise and administer
contracts for major and minor works and maintenance.
The ability of SLRA to maintain almost all its managerial staff and the quality of its performance during
the difficult security situation of the past years has been an exception among public sector agencies in
Sierra Leone, most of which were unable to retain key staff. This has enabled SLRA to continue working
efficiently in the areas not affected by insecurity and to expand its operations effectively as and when the
situation improved.
An important benefit of the project is that an institutional framework for the sector has been established,
which ensures effective, transparent and accountable roads management and administration. However,
there is a need to increase efficiency by separating financing and allocation functions (under the road fund)
-6-



from the management of contracts and supervision of construction and maintenance. The creation of an
independent Road Board responsible for overseeing and monitoring performance in the sector would also be
beneficial.
Especially because of the improvements in maintenance financing and road maintenance by SLRA,
institutional development is rated highly satisfactory.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control ofgovernmnent or implenmenting agency.
Implementation problems were encountered throughout the project period largely as the result of factors
external to the project and the implementation agency, the Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA). The key
factor was the civil war. More than 33 percent of the credit was disbursed to civil works contractors for
damages and loss of timne as a result of this problem. Apart from direct financial losses, more than half the
benefits of the trunk road rehabilitation component were lost when a large part was suspended. Further
losses resulted from the delay in completing the Freetown CBD streets when the project was in abeyance
(1998-1999) and was rated Unsatisfactory for Development Objectives. Other financial losses caused by
civil unrest resulted from the relocation of training camps for small contractors, the complete abandonment
of efforts to promote non-motorized transport in rural areas and the loss of equipment at SLRA
headquarters. During the most severe periods of the civil war in 1998 and 1999 the country program in
Sierra Leone was in suspension and the project was rated Unsatisfactory. When the suspension was lifted
the project rating was changed to satisfactory as soon as contracts were reactivated because the agency had
continued to function effectively and the project could be completed except in the case of a large contract
that had been canceled.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The Government did not provide all the projected counterpart funds and road fund allocations required to
support the project, although it did provide tax and duty free concessions to contractors and SLRA. It also
supported SLRA's operations with funding and the replacement of vehicles and equipment that were
vandalized due to lack of security. The government did not increase the road user fee to US$0.20 per liter
of petrol and diesel, as agreed during negotiations.
5.3 Factors generallv subject to implementing agency control.
The implementing agency generally performed well on factors subject to its control, although financial
management lagged behind the agency's improvements in technical capacity.
5.4 Costs and financing:
At appraisal, total project cost was estimated at $92.74 million. To the total, GOSL was to contribute
$10.85 million equivalent, and IDA $45.00 million, the rest were to be financed by other donors. Due to
civil unrest and severe security issues, the other donors pulled out of the project. IDA credit also had to be
reallocated between categories to implement the "implementable" components. The credit was not fully
disbursed when it closed on June 30, 2001. An amount of approximately SDR 1.9 million
(US$2.4 million equivalent) will be cancelled.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
Maintenance of the road assets created under the project is likely because the SLRA has demonstrated its
ability to supervise and administer maintenance contracts during their 20-year life. The project's
sustainability will depend on the borrower's ability to sustain the SLRA, which is linked to collection of
- 7 -



taxes and fees through the Road Fund. In regards to road financing, much needs to be done to assure that
funds are available to carry out routine and periodic maintenance and complete additional rehabilitation
works. Despite initial success in the collection of road user fees and fuel taxes, this source is contributing
only about 50 percent of the required amount to the Road Fund. The security situation has reduced fuel
consumption and collections to the Road Fund. The Road Fund is key to providing adequate funding to
continue routine and periodic maintenance of all roads throughout the country. In the past the governnent
has been willing, and more so than many other African countries, to sanction levies by the Road Fund and
make them available for road maintenance. As the security, political and economic situation of the country
is improving, there has been a steady increase in Road Fund collections. Further development of the Road
Fund is being monitored under the ongoing Transport Sector Project.
It is encouraging that Sierra Leone's private sector participation in road maintenance was close to the
target levels set at appraisal and should continue to contribute to the sustainability of the program as long
as the required funding is provided.
Sustainability is rated as likely. The effort being made under the follow-up operation, the Transport Sector
Project, to continue to improve the institutional framework, management and resource allocation in the
sector should contribute to the preservation of gains made under the project (see section 6.2). A continuing
return to political stability would clearly contribute to this end.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regutlar operations.
A follow-up Transport Sector Project was approved in June 26, 1996. It seeks to build upon the
achievements of the past operation, address remaining problems and continue to improve the
maintenance and operations of facilities and institutions created under the project. The project
supports a four-year time slice of Government's ten-year sector investment program.
Reconstructionlrehabilitation and periodic maintenance of the road network is included in this
program. A semi-autonomous entity has been established to replace the Directorate of Public
Works to manage road maintenance. An autonomous Road Transport Authority (RTA) has been
created to consolidate the functions of road transport regulation and collection of vehicle
registration and license fees for the Road Fund. Its operating budget is being met from a portion
of the fees that it collects for the Road Fund. RTA is presently collecting road user fees and
remitting them directly to the Road Fund on a bi-weekly basis.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
There were eight identification/preparation missions during identification/preparations, some of which were
combined with the supervision of ongoing projects. Most included a highway engineer and an economist.
This provided important lessons from the previous projects in the highway sector which were integrated
into the project design. Sector management improvements and investment designs were substantially ready
for implementation by appraisal. The rebellion and security problems ensuing during the project
implementation period could not be foreseen. Performance of the Bank in the preparation and appraisal of
the project is rated satisfactory.
7.2 Supervision:
There were 19 supervision missions between January 1993 and November 2000. Supervision was
especially intense during the beginning of the project (7 missions in 1993-94) during project launch and
when important institutional reforms were being consolidated. Six mission members attended the mid-term
- 8 -



review in April 1996. Supervision continued on a limited basis during 1998 and 1999 (one staff member
per mission) when the project was in abeyance and rated Unsatisfactory. Supervision increased at the end
of the project when implementation could be resumed. Supervision by the Bank is rated satisfactory.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Given the frequency of supervision and the persistence of Bank missions in achieving meaningful reform in
the face of a difficult country situation, overall performance by the Bank is rated satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation.
The government recognized the need for fundamental reforms and enabled them to be implemented during
project preparation. The implementing agency was enabled to become an effective agency during
preparation. The government and the agency undertook the necessary financial and institutional reforms
and project design to enable the project to take off. Preparation is rated satisfactory.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The government supported the early implementation of the project, but security problems hampered the
project for most of the implementation period. Since the problems were largely outside its control,
govemment implementation performance is rated marginally satisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
SLRA undertook the agreed reforms and launched the investment components (see Section 4.5). Although
the physical accomplishments were curtailed by the security situation, many of the reforms and institutional
strengthening measures remain in place for future development in the sector. SLRA is making a
contribution to the on-going Transport Sector Project and it is working with other donors to rebuild the
road network and develop the sector. Performance is rated highly satisfactory.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Many of the developments, especially the physical investments, planned under the project could not be
implemented. However, those physical investments that could be implemented were finished. Planned
institutional improvements were achieved to the extent they could be reasonably expected. On balance,
therefore, borrower performance is rated marginally satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
The following main lessons can be drawn from the implementation of this project:
*   A very difficult conflict situation is not necessarily a reason for poor performance. Under this project a
small, strong, well-staffed and motivated institution had been created which was able to keep the
project's objectives in sight and its structure in tact. SLRA illustrates the benefit of "green field"
approach in post conflict situation where new institutions are set rather than adjusting slowly non
functioning oversized institutions.
*   Especially given the context of Sierra Leone at that time it was important to implement a follow-up
project (Transport Sector Project) in order to consolidate the progress in institutional development and
to follow up with additional funding for road rehabilitation and maintenance at the opportune time.
*   The SLRA Act separated the Road Fund from the Ministry of Works and the Road Fund was placed
under the SLRA Board. While this was an improvement over the previous arrangement, it would have
been better to separate the Road Fund (resource mobilization) from SLRA operations
(implementation). This would improve transparency and accountability in the system.
*   Bank management ought to ensure continuity of the task team leader and avoid frequent changes as this
-9-



can result in a break in continuity to the detriment of the project.
*   The Bank needs to be proactive in recommending contract termination soonest in a situation of force
majeur in order to avoid having to pay unnecessary stand-by costs.
*   In a country with recurrent civil strife, it is advisable to have contracts as small as possible to avoid
long implementation time between bid and works completion. This has to be balanced however with
the necessity to have large enough packages to attract bidders.

IMPACT OF PROJECT ON THE COUNTRY
The Project proposed to remove physical bottlenecks in the country's network, by financing Trunk Road
Rehabilitation, City Roads Works Programs and by providing equipment for Periodic and Routine
Maintenance of National Roads.
The completion of the rehabilitation projects of the Central Business District streets, and
Clinetown-Wellington Highway, has helped in some measure solved the major problem of conflict between
traffic flow and pedestrian activity. This has been achieved in the following ways:
1. All rehabilitated streets have been provided with sidewalks.
2. Unsurmountable kerb have been installed on all roads which has ensured separation of the carriageway
and pedestrian walkways.
1.
It could therefore be concluded that the safety of pedestrians have been enhanced and therefore created a
reduction in the level of accidents in the city.
In terms of improving the movement of people and goods, the share of the road network in good condition
has risen from 10% to over 30% and the share of the network in fair condition has risen from 20% to over
30%. These improvements has led to the encouragement of road users to use the road network in the
pursuit of their business activities. This has enhanced the economy of the country as a whole. By
removing some of the physical transport constrains, the project has improved the mobility of passengers
and goods.
A large number of one man contractors have been utilized and the potential pool for developing the Small
and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have been created.
Work was provided on a regular basis for the growing contracting industry as a result of the works
financed under the project, therefore the objective of building institutional capacity in maintaining the roads
was also achieved.
Institutional Impact
The project's institutional development impact was high. The transfer of responsibility from the
Department of Works to the SLRA has improved the management of the road network.
The project component included the purchase of road maintenance and workshops equipment, tools, and
spare parts. It also provided consultant services for engineering design and contract supervision which has
- 10 -



helped the contract management capacity of the professional staff of SLRA.
In order to optimise the return on investment in the road maintenance program, the SLRA established a
computerized Road Maintenance Management System. This has enhanced the Authority's and country's
ability to prioritize road maintenance works.
Project Objective for NMT
The overall goal on NMT was to ease the problem of mobility through the provision of low cost and
appropriate means of transportation to selected rural population. The specific objectives were as follows:
I . To identify pilot areas, using ranking criteria, for participation in the NMT project.
2. Make available on a pilot basis a total of 120 bicycles and trailers to selected project sites with a view
to relieve mothers and children from the burden of head loading and provide transportation for farm
inputs, produce, sick people, etc.
3. To animate and train project beneficiaries in the use, repair and maintenance of NMT units.
4. To conduct base line studies in all pilot villages to assess the socio-economic profiles of these
respective areas. Identify suitable facilities in towns and villages for the maintenance, repairs and
replication of NMT units.
5. Undertake relevant field studies in the areas of rural credit programs on the non-formal sector, the
supply, demand and use of bicycles, and promoting inland water transportation in inter-modal "split" in
Sierra Leone.
6. Procure, distribute and monitor the use of over 3,000 NMT units in all project operational areas over
the expected three years duration of the project implementation.
7. Dissiminate of findings and lessons learned during the implementation.
These objectives were revised and scaled down in line with the projected absorptive capacity. It was
envisaged that the Project would commission in use of 900 bicycles and 1,500 trailer units by 1995. It was
likewise projected that ab out 67% of the bicycles and 80% of the trailers would be locally built and the
Sierra Leone Opportunities Industrialization Centre (SLOIC) was identified as the principal NGO for the
replication of the NMT units. The SLOIC was intimated and a collaborative venture was proposed linking
this establishment and the Technology Consultancy Centre (TCC) of Ghana to provide training of local
manufacturers and repair technicians.
All of the obove objectives were not met principally due to the security situation in the country, however,
the pilot project has created an awareness of the need for the use of non-motorised transport. The project
also identified areas with weaknesses that are to be strengthened in a follow-up project. These include:
1. Traditional Authorities must be involved in future project planning and implementation.
2. Agricultural productivity and output should be arnong the foremost ranking criteria for the selection of
beneficiaries.
3. A nation wide approach should be adopted once the selection criteria has been identified.
4. Local resources and utilization of locally available designs of bicycles, and other equipment should
form the core of any future project.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
The contract award prices for the civil works projects were on an average 15% higher than the
estimated cost at the time of Appraisal. However, the actual construction cost was even much
higher than the contract award price which was due to delays, suspension and destruction of
contractor's camp and equipment resulting  from  the civil unrest.  In the case of
Taiama-Bo-Kenema road only 15 km were completed before the contract was suspended and
ultimately terminated. Approximately 60% of the compensation paid to the contractor was for
works completed. The balance was paid for losses. Although the Freetown CBD Streets are
mostly completed an ERR analysis cannot be done as the traffic does not flow freely and the
streets are congested. However, as the CBD streets conditions have improved as a result of the
project and as the initial ERR was estimated to be 98% it is safe to assume that this component of
the Project has yielded a more than acceptable economic return even with a 31% increase in
construction costs for additional drainage and traffic management measures. For the Cline Town
- Wellington highway an attempt has been made to do an HDM analysis using the actual
construction costs, a 12% discount rate and an assumption that the economic cost is 80% of the
Financial Cost. The analysis is based on a limited June 2000 traffic survey taken during a time
when security measures, such as curfew, restricted the movement of people and goods. Traffic
growth rates are estimated to be 5% per year for all vehicle types in the absence of recent studies.
Assumptions about road conditions including road roughness have been made in the absence of
pre-construction data. Finally all the vehicle ownership and operating cost data was taken from
another recent study in Africa. The ERR for a projected 15 year life; using limited existing data;
and other broad assumptions is estimated to be 43% which is approximately half the CBD
estimate made at the time of Appraisal.
In spite of the positive values which appear to have been achieved for the Freetown Roads CBD
and the Cline-Town - Wellington Highway, the probable negative rate of return of the large road
rehabilitation segment that was not completed but was paid for is likely to have caused an overall
negative rate of return for works under the project.
