TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE CORPORATION ON
A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT BY THE ASSOCIATION TO TE
REPUBLIC OF I2NEIA AND AN DWESTMET BY THE CORPORATION FOR
A PRIVATE DEVEJOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY (PDFCI)
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$10 million on standard
IDA teras and an IFC investment of US$482,000 to help finance a Development Bank
(PDFCI) project, The proceeds of the credit would be relent to PDFCI for about 18
years, including 3 years of grace, with a minimum interest rate at 9 percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECO10MY
2.        The last Bank report on Indonesia (Development Issues for Indonesia,
December 1, 1972; R 73-6/4), contained a discussion of recent economic developments,
but addressed itself principally to longer-term policy issues relevant to the
Second Plan (1974-78) now in preparation. A Bank updating economic mission visited
Indonesia in August this year, and an economic-report is under preparation. Country
data are presented in Annex I.
3.        Indonesia's gross domestic product increased at an average annual rate of 5-6
percent over the last five years. During 1969-71, the steady growth of the economy
was accompanied by relatively stable prices. However, this trend was interrupted
in late 1972, when the prices of food products, particularly rice, began to escalate
primarily as a result of an unexpectedly poor dry season harvest. The Jakarta cost
of living index was 26 percent higher in December 1972 than a year earlier. After
relative price stability in the first quarter of 1973, the general price level has
risen sharply in recent months. This second round of price increases was caused
by a number of factors, the principal ones being the continuing internal as well
as worldwide rice shortage, devaluation of the rupiah along with the US dollar,
increases in the international prices of Indonesia's nmjor imports and inflow of
short-term capital.
4.        Agricultural output is estimated to have increased by about 3 percent
per annum over the last five years, but the growth was considerably less in 1972
due to the drought which affected the entire Asian region.  Rice imports to meet
the shortages in 1972/73 are estimated at 1.2 million tons, up from 530,000 tons
in the preceding year. This year's rice crop is believed to have been much better,
but the Governsent still plans to import, if it is possible, about the same volume
as last year in order to replenish the depleted stocks.
5,        laI the industrial sector, there has been substantial growth in the
production of textiles as well as of other consumer and industrial goods. The



- 2 -
rehabilitation and expansion of domestic enterprises, backed by a continuling in-
flow of private investment and commitments of official aid for several major
indiustrial projects, suggests that the prospects are good for further industrial
growth from the present small base0 Infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion
is underway, financed im large measure by project aid, including IDA credits.
Deficiencies in the transport, power and telecommunications sectors could, however,
becotLa a constrint on agricultural and indusbrial growth urless special efforts
are made to accelerate the iplementation of ongoing and future projects.
6.        In the public sector, Govermnernt revenues in 1971/72 were 20 percent
higher than in the previous year. A much larger increase, il the order of 40
percent, was realized in 1972/73. The largest item in this increase has been
taxes on the rapidly rising earnings of foreign oil companies. other revenues
are estimated to have increased by nearly 30 percent4  The estimated increase
in revenues of !t 172 billioni (US$415 million) not only financed inrcreases in
salaries and mat.erial er-coenditures in the routine Ibudget, but also allowed for
more than doubling (to Rp -i4 billion or TS$353 million) of the surplus available
for development expenditure. Together with counterpart fuands generated by
program aid (estimated at Rp 87 billion or US$210 million) thi.s provided for a
nrpiah development expenditure in 1972/73 of Rp 23E billion (us$565 million)
which was 60 percent more than in 1971/72, in addition, project aid disbursements
in 1972/73 are estimated at Rp 62 billion (us$a50 million).
7,         ith regard to balance of payments, exports (amounting to $L,940
million in 1972/73) have been particularly buoyanto in the last three years,
increasing at an annual rate of 3C-40 percer&t. However, imports have rise-n even
more rapidy and the current account deficit has incr-eased,  Tne rise in exports
was primarily due to art inlrease in the voluLme and price of cil and Aimber expor-tIs,
though in recent months prices of some other major exports (notably rubber) bave
also risen. The increase in irports resulted from the continued high level of
economnic act ivity and the need for essential investment and consurption goods.
B.        Foreign exchange reserves increased rapidly mi 1972, from formerly very
low levels, and reached a net level of US$285 million at the end of 1972. Gross
reserves then amounted to US$459 million, equaivalent to about, thiree months of total
imports at 1972/73 rates and an increase of U$345 m.illion in the year. The changed
situation, however, resulted mainly frome an inflow of shor-t-term capital attracted
by high Ildonesian interest rates. In addition, substantial foreign loans were
contracted in 1972 by state enterprises, notably Pertamina, the national oil cornpany.
The Government has since taken steps to ensure effective cornrol over the amou:nts
and purposes of short and medium-term foreign borrowingo hich, under the new RKF
standby arrangEa-ents agreed on May h, 1973, wi'i be substantially less in the current
year than last year.
9.        The Government is now in the process of assessing Indonesia1s past
performance and future economic potential as part of its preparations for the
Second Plan. This Plan will address itself more directly than was possible in



the rehabilitation phase to the issues of employment, income distribution, and
regional development. Although the ability of the Indonesian Government to
formllate and implement plans, programs and projects has improved, limited
managerial capacity presents a serious obstacle to more rapid growth. This
problem, as wenl as the continued need to iuprove the mobilization of domestic
savings, will also have to be considered in the formulation of the Plan.
10.       Bank Group assistance to Indonesia is a part of the international
support being given in increasing amounts through the IGGI. Aid commitments
have risen from less than US$200 million equivalent in 1967 to over US$600
million for 1971/72, The proportion of project aid has steadily increased over
this period, but substantial program aid remains essential as support for the
balance of payments and - in spite of strcng domestic revenue efforts - as a
source of additional funds for the development budget. For 1972/73, express
or implied commitments made by IGGI members amounted to some US$724 million
equivalent, of which US$320 million was for program aid, including US$110
million in food supplies. In December 1972 the IGGI accepted as reasonable and
realistic, in terms of Indonesia's needs, a request for US$760 million in new
aid commitments in 1973/74. Of the total, US$160 million was requested in food
aid, with US$390 million in project aid and US$210 milliorn in program aid. On
May 7, the IGG7 member countries and agencies announced intentions to provide
non-food aid anounting to US$720 million in 1973/74. Even after allowance for recent
currency realignments, this substantially exceeds the Indonesian request.
11D       The soft average terms of foreigrn assistance in the IGGI framework, and
the rescheduling of pre-1966 exterral debt obligations (under the 1970 Paris Club
agreement with the T,stern countries and Japan, and parallel arrangements with
several Eastern European countries) have kept Indonesia's public debt service ratio
relatively low - estimated at 9 percent of exports for 1972. The capacity to
service external debt will, however, continue to be limited by the size of investment
income transfers arising from foreign investment in oil, hard minerals, forestry
and manufacturing, which amounted to 14 percent of exports in 1972. The maintenance
of low official debt service ratios during the decade will depend on the continued
availability of concessional aid, restraints on short and medium-term foreign
borrowing not directly related to export growth, and further substantial increases
in exports.



PAFOT Dl - BANE GROUP OPERTION3 IN2;YOEMA
12.       Irn or6er to accelerate the pace of economi-c development, Indonesia will
require substantial external sup3port for rehabilitation and improvement of infra-
strnac;`.e and expansion of production capabilities in agriculture, minerals,
forestry and manufacturing.  it will also require continued strengthening of the
institutions for development planning and the management of the econonr, Welfare
and income distri.bution., including family planning, as well as regional development
and related patterns of erploynent and population movements, also need to be given
an ixiportant place in Idonesia's development strate_y.
130       The work of both the Resident Staff iri Indonesia and at headquarters
and the lending activities of the Bank G-roup have bD.en oriented towards these
development objecti-ves. The focus of the  aink` s economic worè in providing
assistance to tha Government in tLe current preparation of Indonesia's next Five-
Year Plan is also along these lines.
Consistent with Indonesiaks low pe r capita incone, large external
resource requirements, and limited debt servicing capacity, the Bea^k Group s
lending to Indonesia (aside from IFC investments) has thus far bee-n in the form
of MA credits. The terms of Bank Groip ass-iJstance to Lndonesla are being kept
under continuing review. In recognition of the urgent need for institutional
reforms, most DA-financed projects have been assoc.ated with 'major reorganizations
of existing institutions or the esta'blishmen-t of ne-w ones, and most credits have
included appropriate provision for consultant services.
15.       As of September 30, 1972, Indonesia .has received 32 DA credits amount:-ng
to US$L4043 million. '1"le Association accounts for l.ess than two percent of
Indonesia Is total outstanding puiblic debt. By _978 it is expected t-o acco;unt for
less than ten percernt of total outstanding debt and Less thvn one percent of
IndonesiaIs annual debt service ob-ligations  Amnex I: contains a suumar statement
of DA credits and IFC investments as of August 31, 1973 and notes on the execution
of on-going projects.
16.       The composition of FDj1 lending relects tthe priorities for rehabilitation
and development est&blished by the Government. Indonesiats fi;rst ?ive-Year Plan
(1969-74) gives highest priority to agicult-ure3  The Association has already
extended four credits to help rehabilitate and develop plantations in the GovenLment
estates sector. Other credits for agriculture inclwde four to assist rehabilitat-on
of irrigation systems and one each for a fisheries ProJect, a seeds multiplication
program, beef cattle development, snallholder rubber develmpment, sugar industry
rehabilitation, and smallholder t-ea developmet. I,.dustury is of growing iportance
to the Indonesian economy and the Association has assisted in three projects in this
sector. It organized a consortiLu of lernders to fainance a Major expansion of the
PUSRI Fertilizer plant, assisted in the reorganization and fiulancing of the major
state development bank (BAPINDO) and provided financial assistance for indonesia's
first industrial estate project. Other priority sectors to which credits have been
extended are power, transportation, te1ecommunications, education and population.
In addition, three technical assistance credits have been made to finance pre-
investment studies undertaken by the Government, whib:ch have helped to establish
investment priorities over a wide range of activities0

17.       The, first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in September 1968, and
about half o£ all credits have been made since July 1971. The Program is
thus new, and the undisbursed portion of the credits is relatively large.
Virtually every credit has been associated with extensive institutional reforms
involving, inter alia, the creation of new project authorities, drafting of new
charters, and enactment of new legislation, all of which have, in most cases,
taken much time. Several credits - including the first two for agricultural
estates project - have experienced delays in disbursement because of
management problems.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND
INDUSTRIAL FIN ANCE
Industrial Development
18.       indonesia is still largely an agricultural society.   Manufacturing
generates only about ten percent of GDP and is concentrated in a relatively
few industries, with food processing, textiles and rubber processing accounting
for most industrial employment. Only about ten percent of the 18,000 industrial
establishments in Indonesia employ more than 300 persons; the rest are small to
medium companies which on average emaploy about 16 persons. Geographically,
manufacturing is heavily concentrated in Java, particularly in the Jakarta area.
19.       Although relatively small, the manufacturing sector has been growing
faster than the rest of the economy during the last five years. A major
contributing factor has been the Governrient's policy, introduced in 1967, of
liberalizing a highly protectionist and heavily state controlled industrial
system by removing import restrictions and relying more on incentives based on
tax and tariff relief.  The Government has launched a program to restore the
productive capacity of public enterprises in cement, paper, fertilizer, textiles
and rubber. It has also been rehabilitating and improving roads, power and
other vital infrastructure necessary for an industrializing economy.
20.       These measures, together with the overall success of the financial
stabilization program (1966-69), have brought about a substantial increase in
industrial investment.  Reliable data are few, but the flow of applications
under the Foreign and Domestic Investment Laws, which regulate new investments,
give an indication of the size and growth of private sector investment.   During
the period 1l67-72, private foreign investments in the manufacturing sector
approved under the Foreign Investment Law amounted to US$697 million, and
investment approvals under the Domestic Investment Law to US$921 million.   Projects
accounting for over 45 percent of prLvate foreign investinents and 56 percent of
domestic investments approvedvunder the above Laws were under construction or in
operation at the end of 1972, In addition, a substantial part of the US$855
million in official project aid from the IGGGI has been coxnanitted to industrial
projects in the public sector.  On the average, industrial investment amounted
to over US$4o0 million a year over the period. On the basis of the pipeline
of projects approved under the two Investment Laws, and the project aid
cormnitted within the framework of the IGGI, the Bank Group estimates that
investment in the industrial sector may grow at the annual rate of 13-15 percent in



-6-
the next decade, a rate that is compatible with an estimated increase in GDP
of 7-8 percent a year. lijor constraints on future industrial growth will be
scarcity of managerial expertise and the lack of capital resources on suitable
terms.
The Financial Sector
21,      Greater economic activity and increased monetization of the economy
during recent years have not been accomnanied by corresponding development in
financial instituations. Tne existing banking network consists of Bank Indonesia
(the Central Bank), five state conmercial banks, a state development bank
(BAPINDO), a joint-venture development bank (Indonesian Development Finance
Company - IDFC), a number of regional development banks, 128 small domestic
private banks and the branches. of eleven foreign banks, and nearly 9,000 small
savings and village banks. Bank Indonesia and th.e state banl:is are predominant,
accounting for almost 90 percent of total outstandLing bar'k credit; domrestic
and foreign private banks account for most of the remainder. Bank Indnesia
is currently engaged, with the help of a team of foreign teclhnical advisers
including an IFO staff member, in a review of the operations of the state banks,
with the objective of inproving their operating efficiency.
22.      In 1968, the Governmenti introduced a medJui-a-term irvestment credit
program (ThVESTASI) to provide investment loans for up to five years through
the state banks. About two-thirds of the assistance provided by state financial
institutions under this scheme has been directed to fairly large industrial
enterprises. The Government has recently begun to reorient its policies and
in April 1973 azLnownced that 65 percent of future loans made available through
the state banks under the INVESTASI program would. be allocated to smaller
industries.  The Government has also esta'blished a new agency, P.T. BaAana, to
make equity investments in and to provide manageme-fnt assistance to small businesses.
23.      The interest rates of state banks are determined by Bank Indonesia,
while private baSks are free to set their own interest rates. The relatively high
interest rates introduced during the l960's for stabilization purposes have been
gradually reduced over the last few years, as overall economic stability has been
restored.  The interest rates are now 12-15 percert for short-term priority loans
and 18-24 perce`t for non-priority short-term loans.  in order to foster long-term
investment, the interest rate on medium and long-term loans has been fixed at a
relatively low 12 percent.  The deposit rates are 6-15 percent per annum, depending
on the duration of the deposit.
24.      The interest rate structure has contributed to a substantial increase in
total deposits but has obvious defects. The rates paid on one-year term deposits
(15 percent per year) are still higher than the interest rate for long-term loans
and, as a result, the state banks have relied on Central Bank refinancing at low
rates of interest to finance up to 80 percent of their long-term investment loans.
Moreover, the short-term lendiAg rate is still higher than the long-term rate, which
reinforces the tendency of financial institutions to lend primarily orn short term.
The Government is aware of the problems inherent in the structure and has begun to
rationalize it.



-7-
25.      Longer term industrial credit is scarce and is presently provided by
only two domestic financial institutions, BAPINDO and IDFC. With assets of
Rp 42.3 billion as of December 31, 1972, BAPINDO is by far the largest
development bank in Indonesia, but its capacity to undertake new lending has
been limited by serious organizational and financial weaknesses. The Bank
Group assisted in the reorganization of BAPINDO and, in June 1972, provided an
IDA credit of $10 million (Credit No.310-IND) to support its lending program.
Now that the reorganization is well underway and many of the problems of the
existing loan portfolio have been attended to, the volume of BAPINDO's new
lending has begun to expand. IDFC, the successor to the Development Bank of
Indonesia, is a sma3ler company with an initial paid-in-share capital of
Rp 560 million, jointly subscribed by Bank Indonesia and the Netherlands
Overseas Finance Corporation (an agency controlled by the Government of the
Netherlands), and initial total resources of the equivalent of Rp 2.6
billion.  Although a w-ell managed institution, IDFC is limited by the size
of its financial resources. The Asian Development Bank is presently
considering a loan to IDFC.
26.      Money and capital markets are in a very early stage of development.
In January 1972 the Government created the Agency for Money and Capital Market
Development, which is working on proposals for an inter-bank call market and
a securities and exchange administra-tion. At the request of the Ministry of
Finance, IFC prepared a long-term policy plar, for the development of the
securities market, which includes changes in the legal framework and
strengthening of financial expertise in the banking and investment community.
An important part of this program is a new institute of higher accounting and
the establishment of more stringent accounting standards.  The Government has
also approved in principle the establishment of several investment bank type
institutions t-o deal in short-term debt instruments, underwriting and hire-
purchase financing.  These will be joint ventures between the state commercial
banks, Indonesian private partners and foreign financial institutions. Four
have been licensed but none has yet begun operations and their potential impact
is uncertain.
27.      It is in the context of the above industrial and financial environmen-t
that the Governrrent decided to encourage the setting up of a private development
finance company in Indonesia. Because of a rapid growth in industrial investment
opportunities, demand for investment capital is strong and is expected to
increase.  The INVESTASI program of the Government banks, the most important
existing source of industrial finance, is limited to loans having a maximum term
of five years which is insufficient for many projects.   Both BAPINDO and IDFC
will take time to reach their full potential.  It is also likely to be some time
before the proposed investment banks will be able to make an important contribu-
tion. The creation of PDFCI will not only provide a needed additional source of
long term capital, but will also offer a broad range of important financial
services not presently available in Indonesia.

28.      An "Outline of Proposal for Establishument of the Private Devel'opmeenb

Credit and Project Summary is contqained in Annex III. A full appraisal report
mas r.t-c Drepared for this project because at the time of appraisal PD?CI had
not yet been established.
29.      The World Bank has been working with the Goverr:Mnt since 1967 to
help inprove the institutions providing ikedium and Iong-term industrial f,inance
in :indonesia.  The Govermen-er  decided in 197Q thact .such finanice should be provided
through three development banking instsitutions: BAI":00  MFD-C) and tne proposed
PDFCI. Subsequent2y, the Bank Group prov-ded substicraatial tectLaical and financial
assistance to BO MD 0, and also assisted in rthe establishmEnt of PDY:PrCI. A Bank
Group mission visited Indonesia in I December 1.972 ard reached agreement with the
Governmnt and the sponsors of PDCTI or the Tlans for its cap:tal structure,
crganizatiorn and operatiorul policies.  IFC assitsed nL organizing a foreigl
shareholders growp, ar.d a second Bank C-roup missionr  whi,h visited Indonesia in
May 1973, assisted in corpleting the arrangeme,s f'or the icoroorat Ion of PLYCI.
Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in 10shington in August 19S 73n  The
delegation was led 'oy Mr. Irzan 1'andjung from the Minist-ry of Finance and PDF.Cl
was represented b-y Sf. A.Y. Mokoginta, Chainnrai of PD    3-CI's Board of Directors.
30,      PDFC was s-oonsored by a group of leading private Indonesian i.restors
and Bank Indonesta, with the active sulpport of tihe 'Wiorld Bank Gnroo  Pi:FICIgts
Charter defines its scope of operatins in broad and .stexible terms; a S3atement

merits of other dsve,opment finarice comanies assoc-ited with t,he World Bankt Group

broad operational fiexibLity, it wil be required u-nder the -Gers o. its policy
statement to give due regard to the Government's overail econbmic r.olicies and
priorities.
31.      PDFCI will be diff ereznt in two respects ftrom many deve,Lopment finance
conpanies associated with the Ban]k Group,: first, it wi-l1 have the capability to
promote projects, and second, it will be able to provide re_fiacirg within
limits. In the present stage of iindustrial, development in TI.donesia, when
opportunities for investmernt are considerable and ezitrepreneurial capability not
yet adequately developed, the promotional role of 1TFC1 will be especially
significant. In addition to developing the ideas of sponsors into bnnkable projects,
PDFCI will develop and investigate its own project ideas and organize enterprises
based on them, i-lveLving indonesian and foreigr firms in ownership and management.
Refinancing is needed in rany cases to restructure t1he capi-tai of worthwhile
enterprises whic. are burdened with excessive mediim-term debt. However, the
resources that F3-FC can use for refinancing will oe limited to 20 percent. of
its total portfolio; and the proceeds of the IDA credit would not be used for this
purpose,



- 9 -
32.      PDFCI's initial capital resources will be as follows:
Equity and Subordinated Government Loan          Equivalent in US$Million
Authorized Share Capital                          6.o
Indonesian Government Subordinated Loan           5.0             11.0

IDA                                              10.0             10.0
Total                         21.0
Of the authorized share capital of Rp 2.5 billion (about US$6.0 million), an
amount of Rp 1.5 billion (about US$3.6 million), or 60 percent of the total, will
be subscribed and paid in by Indonesian shareholders, including Rp 885 million
from private investors and Rp 615 million from Bank Indonesia. Among the important
private Indonesian investors are P.T. Gading Mas, one of the largest private import-
export firms in Indonesia; P.T. Tri Usaha Bhakti, a large diversified industrial
trading concern owned by the Army Welfare Foundation; and P.T. Pan Indonesian Bank,
the largest private commercial bank in Indonesia. Bank Indonesia is expected
gradually to sell Rp 415 million of its holdings to Indonesian private investors.
The remaining 40 percent of the share capital, amounting to Rp 1.0 billion (about
US$2.4 million), will be held by foreign banks and financial institutions, including
IFC. IFC's subscription would be Rp 200 million (US$482,000), or about 8 percent
of the total share capital. A group of eight foreign banks from Australia, Canada,
France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the
United States would take up the remaining Rp 800 million (about US$1.9 million),
or 32 percent of the total share capital.
33.      The Government subordinated loan of Rp 2,075 million (US$5.0 million)
would be made available in three annual installments, the first two of about
US$2.0 million each and the third of about US$1.0 million.  The fi-st installment
would be made available before the IDA credit became effective. The loan would
have an interest rate of four percent per annum and repayment would be over 30 years,
including 15 years of grace. The loan would be subordinated to other debt obligations
of PDFCI in that it would rank pari-passu with the share capital in the event of the
liquidation of the Company. This loan,,wbich was negotiated by the Indonesian
sponsoring group,was critical to their decision to invest in PDFCI. In addition to
augmenting PDFCI's initial resources, it was taken by the group as evidence of the
Government's commitment to and support of a private development bank in Indonesia.
34.      The proposed IDA credit of US$10.0 million would provide for most of
PDFCI's estimated foreign exchange requirements during its first three years of
operation. The credit would be made to the Government, which would bear the foreign
exchange risk and relend the proceeds to PDFCI under a subsidiary loan agreement.
Under the terms of this agreement, PDFCI would pay a minimum interest rate of 9
percent and would be permitted a maximum interest rate spread of 4 percent. PDFCI's



- 10 -
actual lending rate on IDA-financed sub-loans is expected to be slightly higher
than that charged by the state banks under the INVESTASI scheme, but this should
not adversely affect PDFCI's business prospects because of the strong demand for
long-term capital in Indonesia. PDFCI would also pay to the Government a commit-
ment fee of 3/4 of one percent, which would apply only after a sub-project had
been approved for financing by the Association. This conforms to normal Bank
Group policy in respect of a first Bank loan granted to a new development finance
company. The amortization schedule of the subsidiary loan would be amended from
time to time to conform substantially to the aggregate of amortization schedules
of sub-loans made by PDFCI. Sub-loans would have a maximum term of 15 years.
The free limit for sub-loans from the IDA credit for individual sub-projects would
be US$200,000 with an aggregate free limit of US$2.5 million. The ratio of
PDFCI's long-term debt to the sum of its net worth plus subordinated loans would
be limited to a maximum of 3:1.
35.       PDFCI's Board of Directors will consist of 13 members: seven directors
representing the Indonesian shareholders, five directors representing the foreign
shareholders, and PDFCI's Chief Executive Officer who would be 2 member ex-officio.
Mr. A. T. Mokoginta, the President of Tri Usaha Bhakti$has been elected Chairman
of the Board.  The Board will appoint from among its members an Executive Committee
consisting of five members: three Indonesians and two foreign, with authority to
approve individual loans or investments up to Rp 200 million (about US$480,000
equivalent). Loans exceeding this amount would be submitted to PDFCI's full Board
for approval.
36.      Mr. Sulaksana Suparto will be PDFCI's chief executive, with the title
of Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. He has had broad experience both in
Bank Indonesia and subsequently in the private sector0 PDFCI will employ four
experts to assist in management during the first three years of operation. One will
serve as Advisor to the Chief Executive Officer, and the other three will hold
executive positions as Manager of the Project Appraisal Department, Manager of the
Business Development and Promotion Department, and Chief Engineer respectively.
These experts will probably be expatriates,because of the shortage of experienced
personnel in Indonesia, but they will have responsibility for trainirng their
Indonesian counterparts. The three experts holding executive positions will become
advisors to their counterparts once the latter have gained sufficient experience.
The UNDP has agreed to finance most of the cost of these experts and of training
their Indonesian counterparts, under a technical assistance agreement for which
the Bank will serve as executing agency. The nominees for the expert positions
and their terms of reference will be acceptable to the Association. Qualified
Indonesians are expected to fill the senior positions in the other departments
of PDFCI.
37.     Although private domestic investment in manufacturing has expanded rapidly
in recent years, the lack of available financial resources on reasonable terms
remains a principal constraint on the growth of private investment. BAPINDO and



- Il -
IDFC together will be able to finance only a modest proportion of manufacturing
investments during the next few years, so that PDFCI should have ample investment
opportunities. The bulk of PDFCI's clients will cane from the growing ranks of
Indonesian businessmen, some of whom are participating in joint ventures with
foreign sources of capital and know-how. While definite forecasts are difficult
to make, it is expected that PDFCI could reasonably expect to commit US$20-25
million over the first three years of operation, which would be about six percent
of estimated gross capital investment during the period. Given the volume of
expected business, the size and nature of its resources and the interest rate
charged on sub-loons, PDFCI is expected to earn a moderate profit during the
first five years, with prospects for improved profitability thereafter.
PART V - THE IFC INVESTMENT
38.      It is proposed that IFC subscribe for cash 2,000 shares of common stock
of PDFCI at a par value of Rp 100,000 each (about an aggregate US$482,000 equivalent),
pursuant to a Subscription Agreement to be entered into with PDFCI.
39.      Both the Indonesian and the foreign investors attach great inportance to
IFC's proposed investment. The shareholders of PDFCI wish IFC to be represented on
PDFCIts Board and Executive Committee.  This w.ould ccaitribute in substantial measure
to PDFCI's pursuing sound investment policies and generally assure close relations
between PDFCI and the Bank Group. I intend, therefore, to nominate a suitable
person to represent IFC on the Board of PDFCI and on its Executive Committee.
Lo.      fliCs promotional role in organizing the group of foreign shareholders
has been an important factor in the establishment of PDFCI. Its investment has been
one of the key factors in the decision of the foreign and Indonesian investors to
participate. The association of IFC and the other foreign shareholders with PDFCI
will be of considerable assistance in raising foreign exchange resources on market
terms, when PDFCI is ready to tap this scurce, and in maintaining access to inter-
national sources of investment capital and technical know-how for the investment
projects.
h1.      The main conditions of IFC's subscription will be:
(i) that the Association and the Government have entered
into a development credit agreement providing for
US$10.0 million to be channelled to PDFCI, and that
all conditions of credit effectiveness had been met
except the payment of capital subscriptions by Indo-
nesian and foreign shareholders;



- 12 -
(ii) that PDFCI shall have entered into a loan agreement
with the Government of the Republic of Indonesia
providing for a subordinated loan of Rp 2,075 million
and such loan agreement shall have become fully
effective and Rp 830 million shall have been paid in;
(iii) that Indonesian investors have subscribed and paid in
60 percent of the Rp 2,500 million authorized share
capital of PDFCI, and private foreign investors have
agreed to subscribe and pay the remaining 40 percent
of PDFCI's equity capital; and
(iv) an agreement among shareholders has been signed
providing inter alia, for the election of members
of PDFCI's Board of Directors and of the Executive
Committee.
PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and the
Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and the P.T.
Private Development Finance Company of Indcnesia, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association, and the texts of resolutions approving the proposed credit and
IFC investment are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for development finance
cormpany projects.
43.       The special conditions of effectiveness of the IDA credit are that
the Project Agreement between the PDFCI and the Association shall have been
ratified by PDFCI; Subsidiary Loan Agreement shall have been entered into by
the Government and PDFCI for relending the proceeds of the IDA credit; hp 2,500
million of PDFCI's authorized share capital shall have been paid by foreign and
Indonesian shareholders; a subordinated loan agreement shall have been entered into
between the Goverunent and PDFCI and shall have become fully effective; Rp 830
million of the subordinated loan shall have been paid to PDFCI; the Statement
of Policy of PDFCI shall have been approved by PDFCI's Board of Directors; and
the advisor to the Chief Executive Officer and the Managers of the Project
Appraisal and Business Promotion Departments have been appointed.
4L.       In accordance with Section 3(ii) of Article III of the Articles of
Agreement of the Corporation, notice of the proposed investment has been given
to the Government of Indonesia, which has signified that it has no objection thereto.



-13 -
45.       Indonesia has signed and ratified the ICSID Convention.  As is customary
in IFC investments in Indonegia, provision will be made whereby any disputes
between the foreign investors and the Govermient of Indonesia will be submitted to
ICSID for arbitration; the Government of Indonesia has confirmed its agreement to
this.
46.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and that the proposed investment
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Corporation.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
47.       I recormaend that (a) the Executive Directors of the Association approve
the proposed development credit by the Association, and that (b) the Board of
Directors of the Corporation approve the proposed investment by the Corporation.

During the last eighteen months, Government has taken two steps
to improve the situation. It agreed on an action timetable for specific
management improvements. It also commissioned a study by management consultants
to determine a system for effective supervision and control of all Government-
owned estates. Some of the studyts recommendations are being implemented.
Moderate improvenents have since been made in reporting and accounting procedures,
but there is still a need to make more effective use of this information in
exercising management control.
Cr. No. 165    mTectricity Distribution: US$15 Million Credit of October 229
l   ; Closing Date: December 31    =
This project is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 193    PUtRI Fertilizer Expansion: US$35 Million Credit of June 15, 1970
n                   =                =
Implementation of this project began nearly a year later than
anticipated in the appraisal report because of the time required to meet all the
conditions of effectiveness, to select contractors on bid specifications
acceptable to all co-lenders, and to negotiate contracts satisfactory to all
parties. Since the conclusion of the contract, Part I (construction of an
ammonia-urea fertilizer complex with an annual capacity of 380,000 metric tons
of urea) has progressed well and the contractors, spurred on by a penalty-bonus
arrangement, are now on schedule. Part II (construction and installation of a
natural gas gathering system and a 65 mile transmission line to the fertilizer
complex for use as feedstock and fuel and to serve other industrial users) has
also suffered delays, but the construction contract has been awarded and the
system is now expected to supply gas to the fertilizer plant when it will be
required in February 1974 for plant testing.
Current estimates of capital cost show an increase of about 25
percent over the appraisal report figures. Part I shows arn increase of 17 percent,
due to currency revaluations and changes made necessary as detailed design
progressed and the true composition of the gas supply became known. Part II has
been enlarged to increase transmission of gas, in part to meet the increased needs
of the fertilizer complex but also to supply a greatly increased usage by Pertamina
for its refineries and by power plants. This has increased the cost of Part II by
about 78 percent, but has lowered the cost of gas to the fertilizer complex since
the system throughput has been increased by 104 percent.
Current estLmates indicate that these factors will result in
increased foreign exchange costs of US$20.2 million equivalent. AID, OECF and IDA
have agreed to contribute US$4.O million, us$4.5 million and US$5.0 million
respectively to help finance the foreign exchange cost overrun. The Government
will cover the balance required to complete both parts of the project.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 10 Pages
Despite the capital cost increase, the project has become more
remunerative. The economic rate of return has increased from 14 to 21 percent.
because of a faster build-up of sales. Considerably higher world market prices
can now be expected than asswuned in the appraisal report.
Cr. No. 194    Aricultural Estates; US$17 Million Gredit of June 15, 1970;

The DroJect includes rehabilit-ation 3nd drainage wlorks over
186,000 ha. After a slow start, due to problems with preparation of tender
documwnts and difficulties in obtaining acceptable bids, work is now proceeding
somewhat better. Problems of quality and progress still exist and, although
the consultants are tackliLg these vigorously, the lack of a President-Director
to lead the Authority is a serious problem. GOI has been advised strongly to
appoint a suitable replacemer-t shortly. Estimated costs remain within the overall
appraisal estimate, but the project will be one yea:. behind a;praisal schedule.
Disbursements are still slow and w-ere about 4" percent of appraisal estimtes at
the end of MBy 31, 1973.

After a slow start due to procurement difficu]lties, orders for
all equipment except the tropospheric scatter systeci have note been placed. The
management consultants have copleted their Lwork, bat have beeri retained to
inplement the recommendzatLons. TLhere is a cost overr2n of aboet US$1.0 million
due mainly to currency rea ;  m.ents. These matters are De2-1Lg discussed between

Cr. No. 219    Education  US$4h6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970,
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project is about 12 months behind schedule because of the
delay in the appointment of the architect, but is now progressing satisfactorily.
Prequalification of contractors for civil works has been completed and award of
contracts is likely to be made by-early October. Eauipment lists have been
approved by the Association and suppliers h.ave been invited to register their
interest. The leader of the team of overseas specialists has arrived and is
assisting the training of the first group of technical teachers for the centers.
While disbursements were initially slower than expected, it is likely that
construction of the five centers will be completed in less time than originally
estimated and the final implementation would thus be on schedule.
Cr. No. 220    Irrigation Rehabilitation III; US$14.5 Million Credit of
Novem  Decem   er  be
This project covers 202,000 ha and includes rehabilitation and
reintroduction of an 0 & M organization in three irrigation systems, two in
Java and one in South Sulawesi. Construction remains about two years behind
schedule. The problems with preparation of contract documents, which have
caused this delay, have been overcome and while no further delays are expected,
it is unlikely that the time lost could be regained. There has been some
increase in overall project costs, and a review is being carried out to determine
the effect of the dollar devaluation on civil works and equipment contracts
yet to be awarded. Disbursements are improving to about 52% of the level
estimated at appraisal. Sensitivity tests run at the time of appraisal showed
that a two year delay and 15 percent cost overrun would reduce the economic
rate of return from 25 percent to 21 percent.
Cr. No. 246    Seeds; US$7.5 Million Credit of May 1, 1971; Closin Date:
Se   sE   3 0,7
Project implementation is behind schedule due to initial delays in
organization, management and effective procurement. These problems are being
overcome, but because of procurement delays, inflation, currency revaluation and
design changes of the seed processing plant, a 20 percent cost increase for the
ornginal project proposal became likely.   However, recent studies indicate that
the market size for rice seedmay be only about half the original production target.
Therefore the latest Supervision Mission has recoimnended reduction of the seed
production target from 22,000 tons to 12,00CO tons per Praiuni in 1?77, by which time
the need for further development of the seed industry would have been reviewed.
The possi-nility of such n reduction in project output was forseen at the time of
appraisal and provided for in the Credit Agreement. Therefore, two subsidiary
seed proce s:ing centers will not be constructed and the funds now remaining in
the Credi-t will be adequate to complete the project.   The expected economic bene-
fits of the project remain substantial with a rate of return of 59 percent, not
including the research and seed certification components whose benefits are not
easily quantifiable.

This credit is for the rehabilitation for two groups of
Government owned tea estates in TWest Java. Despite management weaknesses
in cost control and efficiency, progress to date is satisfactory and relationships
between management and consultants are good. Recently revised cost estimates
for factory rehabilitation and expansion are substantially above appraisal
estimates and project consultants have been asked to review them.
Cr. No. 260    Highways II; US$34.0 Mill-ion Credit of June _24, 1971; Closing
Date: September .30, 197 _5_-_
This project is in Sumatra and consists of construction with
supervision of about 200 km. of highway, detailed engineering of further highway
sections and a regional development study. The project is about six months behind
schedule, but the construction contracts have all been awarded and no further
delays are expected.

Cr. No. 288    Second Education: US$12_5 Million Credit of March 9, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 197    
Project inplementation has been sLow due to delays in concluding
a contract with consultant architects and in recrui ting technical assistance.
However, the consultant contract has now been signeXd and the project unit has
decided to recruit technical assistance through a FA0 Fund-in-Trust arrangement.
The educational aspects of project implementation, including teachers training
and curricula development, are progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 289    Irrigation Rehabilitation IV; US$12.5 Million Credit of March 9,
1972_ ClosingDate: June 30, 1977
The project is located in East Java and consists of rehabilitation
of the irrigation system and the reestablishment of' 0 & M in five non-contiguous
areas totalling 229,000 ha, known as Pekalen-Sanpean. It also provides for the
eploynent of consuiltants to assist in the execution of Pekalen-Saxpean and for
feasibility studies of further irrigation rehabilitation projects. Civil works
and equipment purchase for the main project, Pekalen-Sanpean, are just beginning
and are on schedule. Consultants for the various studies are at work with their
cotunterparts. Groundwater investigations will be delayed due to procurement
difficulties.  The rehabilitation and storage feasibility studies are on schedule.
Disbursements are on schedule.

Progress under the project is currently being hampered by
organizational weakness and delays in obtaining necessary local currency

Cr. No. 310    De    1  nt Finance: US$10.0 Million Credit of June 7 1972;
This credit was declared effective on August 10, 1972. Commit-
ments and disbursements have been slower than anticipated. The reorganization
took longer to be completed and the institution is burdened with a bad portfolio
inherited from the past. The management and foreign advisors are working on
measures to improve disbursements.

D. IFC PROJECTS IN EXECUTION I/
P.T. Primatexco Indonesia - 194 IND - Textiles
The project was completed on time and within budget. The plant is
operating satisfactorily. IFC is now considering a further investment of $2.3
million to help finance expansion. (IFC/R73-h9)
P.T. Unitex - 195 IND - Textiles
The weaving and finishing departments were completed on schedule
and are in satisfactory commercial operations. The spinning department is expected
to be completed in March 1974, about eight months behind schedule. The total
overrun on the project is expected to be about $1.5 million (13.6% of total project
cost), due maini to the changes in the exchange rate between Japanese yen and
US dollar. (IFC/R73-41)
POT. Seman Cibinong - 199 Io and 255    DM - Cement
The execution of the project financed in part by the first IFC conmitment
was held up because of the delay in finalizing plans to build a new highway linking
Bogor and Jakarta. This was an original condition for the implementation of the
project. Because of increased equipment prices and certain changes in the scope
of the project, trhe estimated project cost increased by $9.0 million (34.6% of total
project cost). EFC made the second investment (255 IND) to cover part of this
cost. Tne plant is scheduled to be completed by December 1974. (IFC/R73-14)
P.T. Kabel Indonesia - Kabelindo - 204 IND - Cable manufacturing
The project was completed in December 1972, with an overrun of about
$1.3 million (22.0% of total project cost) due mainly to price escalation and change
in the scope of the project. Final disbursement of equity will be made in October
1973 in accordance with the terms of the Investment Agreement. The plant is
operating satisfactorily.   (IFC/R73-41 )
P.T. Daralon Textile Manufecturing Corporation - 223 IND - Textiles
There has been a delay of about one year in the start of construotion
of the project. This has been due to the delays in obtaining the necessary permits,
and in working out satisfactory terms for the Convertible Debentures, which is a
new form of investment in Indonesia. These have now been satisfactorily resolved
and the Company has started construction. The first disbursement of the IFC
investment was made in July 1973. The plant is now scheduled to be completed in
March 1974, about one year behind schedule. (IFC/R72-38)

The Investment Agreements were executed in May 1973. Certain management

OUTLINE OP ?ROPOSAL FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF
P.T. PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPAIY OF INDONESIA
1. INTRODUCTION
1.        Since 1967 the possibility of establishing a predominantly
privately-owned and sponsored development finance company in Indonesia,
to provide long-term finance and related assistance to soundly based
private sector enterprises, has been periodically explored by the
Government of Indonesia (GOI), Indonesian private investors, and the World
Bank Group (WBG).
2.        In 1970, the GOI decided that major development banking
institutions would be limited to three in number. These were to be (a)
the Government-owned Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (BAPIN]DO), (b) the
Indonesian Development Finance Company (IDFC) 1/ and (c) a new privately-
owned development finance company to be called P.T. Private Development
Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI).  Following this policy decision the
W3G provided substantial technical assistance to help reorganize BAPINDO,
and also extended two International Development Association (IDA) credits
to BAPINDO to finance projects in the industrial and shipping sectors.
3.        A WBG mission visited Indonesia in December 1972, and reached
broad agreement with the Government and the sponsors of PDFCI, represented
by a Steering Committee, on plans for the latter's capital structure,
organization, and operational policies. A second WBG mlission visited
Indonesia in May 1973, and reached more. detailed agreement on PDGCI's
articles of association, interest rate policy, appointment of foreign experts,
financial forecasts and the identity of the foreign shareholders, among
other matters.
4.        At the request of the Indonesian sponsors, the International
Finance Corporation (IFC),on behalf of the WBG, put together a group of
eight foreign financial institutions, in addition to itself, who agreed to
consider subscribing to 40 percent of the proposed share capital of P:FOI,
if IDA decided to proceed with a proposed US$ 10 million credit. The
subscriptions of the Indonesian shareholders, who will hold 60 percent
of PDFCIts snare capital, had already been arranged by the Steering
Committee.  PDFCI was incorporated on July 26, 1973, with Indonesian shareholders
paying in 25 percent of their part of the share capital in cash.
1/   IDFC is a 50-50 joint venture between the Government of Indonesia and
Dutch financial interests. The Dutch investment is held by Firancierings-
MaatschappijTvoor-Ontwikkelingslanden (FMO), in which the majority equity is
controlled by the Government, and the minority interest is held by Dutch
commercial banks.



5.        Developments nr the structure of financial institutions in
t- onesia have not kept pace w-ith the greate-r economic activity and
increased monetization of the economy during recenit years. The only exceptions
have been the entry of the foreign banks on the Indonesian scene, the
establishment of IDFC, the reorganization of BAPINDO, and the proposed
establishment of investment companies. The GO1 recently announced the
establishment of a new agency called P.T. Biahana, which wll make equity
investments in small and nediun private limited companies, to help small
businessmen reach the 25 percent minimum venture capital outlay necessary
to qualify for state bank loans. It will al.so prov-.de .managerial advice
and assistance to the small 'businessman. Mlajor stwructural changes were
also recently made in the I'NVESTASI medium-tern investment credit scheime
(see Annex 1) that will have the effect of making this schE:.e potentially
more beneficial to the small business sector.. Financial zrnernediaticn
is still dominated by com-mercial banks which are, for all practical purposes,
the sole mobilisers of savings, and also acco-ant for a substantial part of
outstanding credit in the organized sector. The ecornomy is growing rapidly,
and the shortage of medtun and long-term credit for industry and agricalture
is becoming a serious constraint on development. Tne broadening of the
development process during the next Plan will create new demands not only
for additional resources but also for improved  financial intermediation.
6.        Private enterprise gernerally remai-ned suppressed during the previous
regime. The present Government has reoognized that a vigorous private sector
is vital to maintain the present economic mo7ientwu, and filly suprorts trhe
establishment of a private development finance company, which will do mucn
to improve fiianc-al resource allocation, and will function on a more business-
like basis.  PDFKCI is also eepected tvo play a pioneering role irn promoting
promising industrial ventures.
7.        The establis'hl-ent of' PDFCHi, which will- provide a aroad range or
financial and managerial services to t;he p-rivate sector in Indonesia, will
help expand substantially the role of deve±cpoment banks, carrently limited
largely to BAPI1DO and IDRS, in raeeting the fast-growing long-term financial
requirements of a vital sector of the Indonesian economy.
ét. THE PROPOSAL
Two-stage Foriration
8.        The establishment of PDECI is to be achieved in two steps to
facilitate the entering into agreements with the WBG and f'oreign shareholders
Wy an establi3hed legal entity. The first stage, acco.nolished in July 1973,
included the incorporation of the company; the paying-in of 25 percent of
their part of the share capital by the Indonesian investors; appointment
of the first Board of Directors, a Chairman, and a Chief Executive Officer.
9.        The sec-ond stage,whioh, should be accomplished by October/November
1973, would include the paying-in of their part of the share capital by



foreign investors; the paying-in of the balarce of their part of the share
capital by the Indonesian shareholders; the expansion of the Board to
include the foreign Directors; the signing and effectiveness of the IDA credit;
the paying-in of the first instalment of the special Government loan; the
assumption of duty by senior staff members and most of the foreign experts
under a proposed UNDP technical assistance project; and the opening of its
doors for business.
Sponsors
10.       PDFI is sponsored by a group of leading private Indonesian
investors, representing commercial banks and industrial and trading concerns,
Bank Indonesia and the W3G. Among the important private Indonesian investors
are P.T. Gading Mas, one of the largest import-export firms in Indonesia,
P.T. Tr- Usaha Bhakti, a large diversified industrial and trading concern,
which is owned by the Army Welfare Foundation,(whose shareholders are present
and retired personnel from the armed forces), and P.T. Pan Indonesia Bank,
the largest private commercial bank in Indonesia. A Steering Committee
consisting of eight persons, representing the proposed Indonesian sharehoiders,
was set up to carry out the preliminary work relating to the formation of
PDFCI and to negotiate with groups such as TDA and the foreign shareholders.
A list of its members is given in Annex 2.
Legal Basis
11.       PDFCI is to be set up under the provisions of the Indonesian
Commercial Code, and decrees of the Minister of Finance relating to
financial institutions.  It will be a limited liability company or "Perseroan
Terbatas" (P.T.), formed for a period of seventy-five years.
12.       The proposed corporate style for this company will be the western
type with a single Board of Directors, and a Chief Executive who will be
vested with the authority to make day-to-day operating decisions.   Each
share vll have one vote.
13.       PDGI's functions will be determined bty its Articles of Association,
which were prepared by the Steering Committee in consultation with the WG,
and adopted at the first meeting of the shareholders after PDFCI's
incorporation. Chatnges in the Articles will be subject to prior WBG
approval.
Position of Foreign Investors
14.       Dividend remittances and repatriation of the sale proceeds of.
investments made in Indonesia by foreign investors, are freely permitted
under current regulations, after payment of current taxes, including
withholding taxes of 20 percent on dividends.



15.      PDFCI is a joLnt-ventuare but since it i.s also a financial instit-
ution it will not be eligible for the special tax exemptions available under
Act No. 1 of 1967 governirg -Foreign Capital Investment, and Act No. 6 of.
1968 governing Domestic Capital Investment, as amended and supplemented.
It ^ _ pay taxes at the normal corporate rate, currently 20 percent of
total profits up to Pp. 5 million, and 45 percent of the balance exceeding
Rp. 5 million.
16.       Indonesia has signed and ratified the International Center for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICS1D) Convention. The GOT has agreed
that any disputes between the foreign investors in PDFI and itself will
be submitted to ICSID for arbitration.
Government Consents
17.       The Governmernt of indonesia has agreed to make avrailable the
following concess-Lons to ?DFCI:
(i)    paynent of stamp duty on the paid-up share cajital
of PDKCI to be made in eight auarterlTy instalments,
ins-vead of in one lump sum;
(ii)   PDFKI may set up an amount not exceedin,e 2 percent of its loan
portfolio as a reservre for bad debts, which will be an allowabie
deductlon for tax purposes; 1/ and
(iii)  a special Government rupiah loar. to P?KIT in The amount
of Rp. 2,075 million, to be repaid over thirty years (paragraph
26).
Objectives/Scope of Operations
18.       The objectives ofP PDCI are to assis'c in!, the creatI'on, expansion
and modernization of private industriaal enterprises; to assist in the
development and expansion of the capital market; and to nelp improve the
technical, finiancial, managerial and administrative practices of private
enterprises in Indonesia.
19.       PDFCT wil1 p-ovide financing in a variety of ways.  It will
be empowered to make medium and long-termp loans (including those for permanent
working capital), -to invest in euities, to provide guarantees,
to underwrite corporate equity and debt securities, and to provide
technical, financial aLd managerial consultancy services. One of'
its most impor-tant activities will be the identification of new projects and
promotion of new enterprises.  It also intends to extend refinancing facilities
in selected cases, within stated aggregate limits, to enterprises which are
burdened with unrealistic repayaent schedules on existing medium-term
loans, and are in need of capital reconstruction.
1J/  Norma2ly only bad debt write-offs are considered arn allowable deduction
for tax purposes in Indonesia.



20.       PDFKI will provide assistance to private sector companies in
Indonesia. Government-owned and Government-operated enterprises will be
excluded, since they will normally have access to other government
financial institutions like BAPINDO. The existence, however, of a Government
interest of not more than 15 percent of the voting stock of an
enterprise shall not make it ineligible -for financing by ?DFC.
21.       PDFCI's Articles of Association define its scope of operations
in broad and flexible terms. A Policy Statemen- (paragraph 22) to be
adopted by the Board of Directors defines more specifically the scope
of its intended operations.  While P?DCI's primary field of activity will
be.the manufacturing and processing industries, it may also finance other
types of enterprises, including those engaged in transport- and communications,
tourism, large-scale commercially orLented agriculture (including fisheries
and livestock), mining and construction. Trade and small-scale agricult-ure
will be excluded from its scope of activities. It will finance both new
enterprises and the expansion or modernization of existing enterprises.
Enterprises which can be expected to have access to foreign or international
sources of finance, such as branches or wholly owned subsidiaries of foreign
firms, would not normally be financed by PDFCI.   In lts operations, it
will give due regard to the Government's general economic plans, policies
and priorities. It will be empowered to set up subsidiaries and affiliated
companies, if required to meet its objectives.
Financial and Operational Policies
22.       Attached as Annex 3 is the Statement of Financial and Onerational
Policies which will guide PDFKI's activities.   It is similar in most respects
to policy statements adopted by other development finance companies
associated with the WB,&, and is acceptable to the WBG.  It will be adopted
by PDFCI's Board of Directors, before the Droposed IDA credit becomes effective.
These policies provide, inter alia, that PDKI will make its investment decisions
only on the basis of sound investment criteria and standards, will diversify
its loans and investmients; will turn over its portfolio as best it can; will
not take a controlling interest in any enterprise it finances, except those
that it promotes, and that too for temporary periods; will limlit its debt
to prudent amounts, will lend and invest in a manner best calculated to :nain-
tain the value of its capital; will protect itself against foreign exchan_e
risks; will build ap a staff adequate for meeting its objectives; will follow
a sound reserves and dividend policy; and will have an annual indepen.ient
audit.
23.       Any amendment of the Statement of Financial and Operational Policies
will require the approval of a two-thirds majority of the Board, and the
prior concurrence of the WBG.

(b)   interest rate, 4 percent per annum
(c)   repayment over 30 years, including 15 years grace
(d)   to be subordinated to all other debt and to rank pari-
passu with share capital, in the event of the liquidation
of the company.
Because of the special features of this loan, outstanding amounts will be
added to the company's net worth for the purpose of calculating its
debt-equity ratio.  This Loan was an important pre-condition for attracting
the private Indonesian investment irn PDFCI.
27.      Proposed IDA Credit. A US$ 10 million credit is envisaged to
help PDFUI meet the estimated foreign exchange cost of the projccts it will
finance during its first three years of operations.  The credit will be
granted to the GOI and relent to PDFCI on terms satisfactory to IDA.
These terms include repayment in local currency 1/ a minimum interest rate
of 9 percent per annum to be paid by PDFCT, and a maximum spread of 4
percent per annum on sub-loans. The amortization schedule would be
amended from time to time to conform substantially to the aggregate of the
amortization schedules of loans and investments made by PDFCT. A iree
limit of US$ 200,000 is proposed, with an aggregate free limit of US$2.5
million. The ratio of PDFKI's long-term debt to the sum of its net worth
plus outstanding amounts of subordinated loans has been set at a maximum
of three. A commitment fee of 3/4 of 1 percent would be payable by PDFCI
to the Government of indonesia, but would apply only when IDA authbrizes
a sum for withdrawal with respect to a specific project, and only to the
amount so authorized. This conforms to normal WBG policy in respect of a
first credit granted to a new development finance company.   PDFCI would charge
its borrowers an appropriate comaitment fee.   Sub-loans will have a maximum
term of 15 years. The Loan Agreement between the Government of Indonesia
and PDFCI will reflect the above terms in form satisfactory to IDA.
28.       In the event that PDFCI should require additional foreign currency
resources during the first three years of its operations, IFC and the other
foreign shareholders have indicated their willingness to help PDKCI raise
an amount of US$5 million at the appropriate time.
Interest Rates
29.       PDFCI proposes charging interest rates that will reflect its
estimate of the market in Indonesia, for the types of loans to be made by it,
1/ The GOI is unwilling to allow PDFCI's sub-borrowers to bear the foreign
exchange risk, particularly in the current unsettled conditions in the
international exchange markets. Since the WBG policy is against the
assumption of foreign exchange risks by dfcs, the GOI has decided to under-
take this risk in respect of the proposed IDA credit.

Relationship with other Development Banks
45.      PDPCI will be one of three major development banks in Indonesia.
No formal division of responsibilities for these institutions has been
laid down by the Government of Indonesia.  PDFCt expects to maintain
close consultation with the other development banks, and to act in concert
to the extent feasible, in fulfilling their common objectives.
46.      PDFCI will be well equipped to handle the promotion of promising
private sector industrial ventures, a new departure for development banks
in Indonesia. Its relationship with the proposed investment banks will
depend in large measure on the nature of the activities that the latter
undertake, once they are established.
III.     CON(LUSION
h7.      There is a need for a private development finance company in
Indonesia. Its establishment would make available additional financial and
managerial assistance from institutional sources to the growing private
sector.  Its close connections with leading financial institutions from
different parts of the world would also assist in the mobilization of a
high quality of management and staff, and an efficient level of cperations.
48.      The proposed TDA credit and IF  investment would enable the Bank
Group to make an important contribution to the successful establishment of
PDBCI and, through it to the expansion of the industrial and service sectors.
PDFCI would provide not only investment capital but also, and perhaps more
importantly, advice and assistance in the promotion of new industrial
projects.  The proposal set forth in this Outline represents a suitable bas: s
for commencing PDFCI's operations.

MEDIUM-TE.M INVEST E T CREDIT FUNT) SCHEME ( INTESTASI)
1.         In 1969, a medium-term investment credit fund scheme (INVESTASI)
was introduced to provide three to five-year loans through Indonesia's
state-owned banks, at a concessional interest rate of 12 percent per annum.
This rate has not been changed since the inception of the scheme. However,
coinciding with a revision of interest rates in April 1973, major changes
were announced in the scheme, that will have the effect of making it
potentially more beneficial to the small business sector in Indonesia,
which previously enjoyed no special concessions under the scheme. A
summary of the revised scheme follows:
2.         Investment credits will be classified into four broad groups,
on the basis of the amount of credit extended per project:
GROUP                                    AMO=JT OF CREDIT PEPR PROJECT
I                                     up to Rp. 25 million
II                                    above Rp. 25 million and up to
Rp. 100 million
III                                   above Rp. 100 million and up to
Rp. 300 million
IV                                    above Rp. 300 million
3.         During each official fiscal budget year, the total amount of
investment credit available to all the Government banks will be fixed.
The relative overall share of the above-mentioned groups in the extension
of this amount of credit will be as follows:
GROUP I                              30%,
GRO-UP II                            35%
GROTJP III                           20%
GROUP IV                             15%
4.         The various groups who obtain investment credit funds will have
to arrange to provide the following proportion of the overall investment
needs of individual projects from their own resources:
1/
GROUP              PRIORITY PROJECTS-       NON-PRIORITY PROJECTS
I                        25%                     50%
II                       25%                     50%
III                      25%                     50s
IV                       35%                     50g
5.         For each credit that is approved, the Government cank will act
as the rrxecutor Bank," and funds will be jointly provided by it and the Bank
1/   Priority projects include among others those in the field of basic
industry, infrastructure, tourism, transportation, agriculture, fisheries,
exports, pharmaceuticals and nine essential commodities.

P .T. PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY OF INDONESIA
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL POLICIES
The objective of this Statement is to set out in broad outline
the financial and operational policies of P.T. Private Development Finance
Company of Indonesia (PDFCI).
PDFCI, whose objective is to promote the expansion of private
enterprise in the Republic of Indonesia, through financial, technical
and managerial assistance, will be guided by the policies set forth below:
I.        THE SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES:
1.    PDFCI will finance only productive enterprises. While
its primary activity will be in the field of manufacturing and
processing industry, it may also finance other types of enter-
prises, including those engaged in transport and communications,
tourism, large-scale commercially oriented agrilculture, (including
fisheries and livestock), mining, and construction. It may
also finance real estate to the extent that it contributes
to the development of the above sectors. Trade and small-scale
agriculture will be excluded from its scope of activities.
2.    PDFCI will only finance enterprises which are privately
o-wned and managed. It will not finance enterprises which are
Government owned and operated, and which are directly or
indirectly controlled by the Government. The existence of a
Government or other public interest of not more than 15% of
the voting stock of the enterprises,shall not make it ineligible
for financing by PDFCI. Its total financing of the latter
category of enterprises shall not at any time exceed 10% of
its total portfolio.
3.    PDFCI will finance both new enterprises, and the expansion
or modernisation of existing enterprises.
4.    In its operations, PDFCI will give due regard to the general
economic plans, policies and priorities of the Government of
Indonesia.
5.    Enterprises which can be expected to have access to foreign
or international sources of finance, like brsnches or wholly
owned subsidiaries of foreign firms, would not normally be
financed by PDFCCI.
6.     PDFCI will provide financing to private enterprises in
all appropriate ways, but more especially as follows:

12.    PDFI will normally be guided by the following limits
in regard to the maximum commitment it will make, in what-
ever form:
a.     in a single project                      15%
b.     in a single enterprise or a group of
associated enterprises                  25%
of the sum of its net worth and subordinated loans, which
loans in the event of liquidation, shall rank both after all other
debt of PDFC7 and pari passu with equity.  PDFCIts financing
shall not normally exceed half the cost of the fixed assets of
the enterprise.
13.    PDFCI will not normally commit to any single enterprise
in the form of equity capital more than 10% of its own net worth.
The aggregate equilty investments of PDFCI at any time shall not
exceed the total of its net worth.
14.    In financing projects requiring more than its maximum
lending limits under Clauses 12 and 13, PDFCI will seek the
cooperation of other financial institutions, both domestic and
foreign, through such methods as syndication and joint financing.
IV.       TURNOVER OF PORTFOLIO:
15. PDKCI will seek through its operations to broaden the
ownership of private securities in Indonesia, and with this
purpose in view it will seek to revolve its portfolio, whenever
it can do so on satisfactory terms. In selli-ng an investment
it will paY due regard not only to its own interests, but also to
the interests of other participants in such investment, and to
the interests of the concern whose securities are involved.
V.        RELATIONSHIP WITH ENTERPRISES FINANCED:
16.    Except in enterprises promoted by it, and in such cases
for temporary periods, PDFCI will not take a controlling interest
in any enterprise In which it has an equity investment, or any
other interest which would give it primary responsibility for
management. Nevertheless, in the case of jeopardy it may take
such action as may be necessary to protect its interest.
Accordingly, it will not normally take up more than 25% of the
share capital of an enterprise except as the result of an under-
writing commitment undertaken in the expectation that the invest-
ment would in fact be-within the limit cited.
17.    In accordance with normal banking practice, PDFCI will
require its borrowers to provide and to maintain adequate security,
