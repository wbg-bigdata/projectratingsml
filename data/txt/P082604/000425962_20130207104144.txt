                                    Project Development Objective
Original Project Development Objective: To assist the Government of Vietnam in establishing
and maintaining national, provincial and local policies and capacity to design, implement and
evaluate information and service delivery programs designed to halt the transmission of
HIV/AIDS among vulnerable populations and between vulnerable populations and the general
population, thereby assisting the Recipient in the implementation of its National Strategy on
HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control. In the results framework of the IDA Grant, the vulnerable
populations were defined – based on available epidemiological data and disease burden – as
being Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), Injecting Drug Users (IDUs), Commercial Sex
Workers (CSWs), and their clients and sexual partners). In the 2010 Additional Financing
Project Paper, the list of vulnerable populations was revised to focus on IDUs, CSWs, and their
clients and sexual partners.

Project Development Objective with Revised Definition of Vulnerable Populations: To assist the
Government of Vietnam in establishing and maintaining national, provincial and local policies
and capacity to design, implement and evaluate information and service delivery programs
designed to halt the transmission of HIV/AIDS among vulnerable populations (including people
living with HIV/AIDS, injecting drug users, commercial sex workers and their clients and
sexual partners, and men having sex with men) and between vulnerable populations and the
general population, thereby assisting the Recipient in the implementation of its National
Strategy on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control. The PDO has the minor change on the
definition of vulnerable populations, which has been expanded to include one more vulnerable
population – men having sex with men (MSM).

Project Description: The Project aims to achieve the PDO through 3 project components:
Implementation of provincial HIV/AIDS Action Plans (Component 1), National HIV/AIDS
policy and program (Component 2), and Project management (Component 3).

I. INTRODUCTION

1.      The Project Paper (PP) presents an Additional Financing in the amount of GBP 5.83
million (USD 9.38 million equivalent) through a DFID-financed Trust Fund grant to the Vietnam
HIV/AIDS Prevention Project (P082604). In addition, this PP seeks approval of the Vice
President of a restructuring comprising: (i) minor revision of the Project Development Objective
by adding one vulnerable population (men having sex with men) to the beneficiaries of the
project; (ii) revision of the results framework to measure the results associated with the
additional vulnerable population, and to ensure that the country's set of national indicators is
used in the measurement of the project results; and (iii) reallocation of project cost from
Unallocated Category to provincial Sub Grants Category under Part A of the project.

2.     To date, the project has been financed by (i) an IDA Grant (IDA Grant Number H1520-
VN) that closed on December 31, 2012 and which is fully disbursed (99.97%); and (ii)
Additional Financing from DFID (RETF096672) with a current closing date of December 31,
2013.

3.      In September 2012, DFID informed both the Government of Vietnam and the World
Bank that it had made available additional funds to the existing financing agreement for a 12-
month period (up to 31 December 2013) in the amount of GBP 5.95 million (equivalent to USD
9.56 million). Of this amount, GBP 5.83 million (equivalent to USD 9.38 million) will be
available to the Government for scaling up of project activities to enhance impact and facilitate
sustainable transfer of project activities to other funding mechanisms, and GBP 0.12 million will
be allocated to the World Bank for administrative costs and supervision. In their response in
October 2012, the Vietnam Ministry of Health indicated that the additional funds would be used
for scale-up and sustainability purposes to enhance the impact of the project. On January 4, 2013,
the State Bank of Vietnam requested the World Bank to process the Additional Financing.

II. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

Background

4.      What the Project set out to achieve: In 2005, the World Bank financed the Vietnam
HIV/AIDS Project (P082604) through an IDA grant that closed on December 31, 2012 (IDA
Grant Number H1520-VN, USD 35 million, effective October 17, 2005). The PDO was to assist
the Government of Vietnam in establishing and maintaining national, provincial and local
policies and capacity to design, implement and evaluate information and service delivery
programs designed to halt the transmission of HIV/AIDS among vulnerable populations and
between vulnerable populations and the general population, thereby assisting the Recipient in the
implementation of its National Strategy on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control. In the results
framework of the IDA Grant, the vulnerable populations were defined as being People Living
with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), Injection Drug Users (IDUs), Commercial Sex Workers (CSWs),
and their clients and sexual partners (based on available epidemiological data and disease
burden).

5.     Additional Financing in 2010 to scale-up and fund additional Project activities: In
2010, DFID and the World Bank negotiated an Additional Financing (‘2010 AF’) for the scaling
up of activities financed by the Project. The value of the 2010 AF managed by the Government
                                                6
through an RETF (TF096672), which became effective on March 10, 2010, was GBP 17.20
million (equivalent to USD 27.66 million1). This co-financing enabled an increase in the number
of Project provinces from 20 to 32 (out of the total 63) provinces in Vietnam, and was intended
to enhance the achievement of the original PDO. During the 2010 AF negotiations, the project
results framework was adjusted to reflect changes in project indicators and a refinement of
project activities, and the list of vulnerable populations was revised to be defined as IDUs,
CSWs, and their clients and sexual partners.

6.      Current Status: The project has recorded satisfactory results to date. Implementation
and progress toward achieving the PDO are both rated satisfactory. Overall implementation has
been positive and progressing well in terms of achieving the targets. The latest ISR (December
2012) indicates that PDO indicators and one intermediate indicator have exceeded their end-of-
project targets; four of the other six Intermediary Results indicator values are within 20% of the
end of project targets set for them. Harm reduction activities for vulnerable populations are being
implemented despite lower levels of funding in calendar year of 2012. Progress with project
outputs (up to October 2012)2 are as follows:

a) IDUs: The project target in 2012 is to reach 68,310 IDUs out of the estimated number of
   82,626 IDUs in 32 project provinces. In the first eight months of 2012, the project was able
   to reach 62,755 IDUs, representing 92% of the annual target to date. Up to September 2012,
   the project distributed 18.5 million syringes and needles to IDUs, accounting for 75% of the
   2012 annual target. This is on track in terms of reaching the annual 2012 target. The number
   of communes where activities have been implemented increased from 1,593 in 2011 to 1,823
   in 2012.

b) CSWs, CSW clients and CSW sexual partners: In the first nine months of 2012, 73% of
   the estimated CSWs in the project localities were reached, which is slightly higher than 2011.
   The number of condoms sold in the first nine months of 2012 was 25.4 million – 47%
   through traditional outlets and 53% through non-traditional outlets. As expected, the number
   of condoms distributed for free dramatically decreased by 61% from 16.8 million in 2011 to
   6.5 million in 2012 (due to the condom social marketing program, which promotes the
   purchasing rather than free distribution of condoms).

7.     Commitments, Disbursements and Covenants: The IDA grant (Grant H1520-VN) is
now closed. The DFID Trust Fund (TF096672) is also almost fully disbursed, with an
undisbursed amount of USD 2.06 million out of the original USD 27.66 million1, to be fully
committed by December 31, 2013. All grant covenants are met. All audits have been satisfactory
and no overdue audit report has been noted.

Rationale for Additional Financing

8.       Additional project activities in line with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
and epidemic dynamics in Vietnam: The new AF (2013 AF) activities are in line with the CPS
priorities of addressing improvements in basic public service delivery and access are especially
needed for Vietnam’s poor, vulnerable, or otherwise disadvantaged people (in this case, all sub
populations at higher risk of contracting HIV, including MSM). The project will (a) continue to
address the most critical HIV prevention challenges identified in the original Project Appraisal

Document, (b) including through new epidemiological evidence about increased HIV prevalence
amongst MSM in some provinces in Vietnam, and (c) through ongoing policy dialogue.

9.      Additional financing will result in enhanced sustainability by focusing on
supplementary activities that can be implemented by confirmed funding sources after
project closing: In order to ensure sustainability of project activities, innovation grants
(innovation grants were a short term set of activities financed under the project in the initial years
of implementation, meant to provide new ideas on how to prevent HIV) will not be financed
under the 2013 AF (i.e. activities with no foreseeable implementation lifespan beyond December
31, 2013), nor will behavior change activities be financed under the 2013 AF (because of other
funding being available for these activities); however implementation will be done per agreed
arrangements to ensure that the gamut of HIV prevention services that the project has funded
will continue to be delivered after project closing on December 31, 2013 (for example: some
HIV counseling and testing sites that the project financed will in future be financed by the Global
Fund for HIV programs in Vietnam). Further, sustainability will be strengthened by ensuring that
the most efficient models of HIV prevention service delivery are funded in 2013. Where needed,
alternative models of service delivery will be tested and assessed for efficiency. Consequently,
implementation of the activities in 2013 will need to be carried out in close collaboration with
other programmes such as those funded by the Global Fund, United States Government, United
Nation agencies and the Vietnam Government-funded National Targeted HIV Program.

III. PROPOSED CHANGES

10.     Minor PDO change – addition of one population (MSM) to the vulnerable
population definition: The epidemic among MSM appears to be growing especially in urban
areas (HIV prevalence amongst high risk MSM in Ho Chi Minh City, for example, has surged
more than five-fold to 15.3% in 2011), and it is therefore an important population to focus on so
as to ensure that the PDO is achieved. It is therefore necessary to add this population to the
definition of ‘vulnerable populations’ as defined by the project.

  Original Project Development Objective: To assist the Government of Vietnam in establishing
  and maintaining national, provincial and local policies and capacity to design, implement and
  evaluate information and service delivery programs designed to halt the transmission of
  HIV/AIDS among vulnerable populations and between vulnerable populations and the
  general population, thereby assisting the Recipient in the implementation of its National
  Strategy on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control.

  In the results framework of the IDA Grant, the vulnerable populations were defined – based
  on available epidemiological data and disease burden – as being PLWHA, IDUs, CSWs, and
  their clients and sexual partners. In the 2010 Additional Financing Project Paper, the list of
  vulnerable populations was revised to focus on IDUs, CSWs, and their clients and sexual
  partners.

  Project Development Objective with Revised Definition of Vulnerable Populations: To assist
  the Government of Vietnam in establishing and maintaining national, provincial and local
  policies and capacity to design, implement and evaluate information and service delivery
  programs designed to halt the transmission of HIV/AIDS among vulnerable populations
  (including people living with HIV/AIDS, injecting drug users, commercial sex workers and
  their clients and sexual partners, and men having sex with men) and between vulnerable
                                                  8
  populations and the general population, thereby assisting the Recipient in the implementation
  of its National Strategy on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control.

  In essence, the PDO wording remains the same but the definition of vulnerable populations
  has been expanded to include one more vulnerable population – men having sex with men.

         (a) Change one intermediate outcome for Project Component 1: The intermediate
         outcome will include the addition of MSM as a vulnerable population: 32 participating
         project provinces have the policies and capacities to utilize block grants to design,
         implement and monitor HIV/AIDS programs which promote harm reduction (increased
         opiate substitution, clean needle-syringe and condom use) to reduce HIV transmission
         among vulnerable populations (IDU, CSW, their clients and families and MSM).

         (b) Add one additional intermediate outcome indicator for Component 1, with a
         target: The number of lubricant sachets distributed to MSM in the last 12 months. The
         12-month cumulative target is for 480,000 lubricant sachets to have been distributed.

         (c)     Align the PDO and component 1 intermediary results indicators to the new
         2012 National HIV M&E system indicators: The Government of Vietnam had only
         developed a national HIV M&E system in 2007, and revised it in 2012. Since the project
         aims to assist the Government of Vietnam in establishing and maintaining national,
         provincial and local policies and capacity to design, implement and evaluate information
         and service delivery programs designed to halt the transmission of HIV/AIDS among and
         between vulnerable populations and the general population, the project indicators need to
         be drawn from the national HIV M&E system (in line with WB OP 13.60). The 2010
         Additional Financing Paper outlines the selected national HIV M&E system indicators
         with which project results would be measured. For the purpose of the 2013 AF, the 2010
         results framework has been refined to exclude all the indicators that were dropped in
         2010, and updated to reflect the 2012 set of indicator definitions, the latest indicator data,
         and indicator-specific targets. See Annex 1 for the proposed changes to the indicators, the
         project results achieved to date, and the project’s proposed revised results framework.

12.    Finally, the proposed restructuring seeks to reallocate the full amount under the DFID
Grant Unallocated Category of the original Trust Fund Grant (TF096672) to the provincial Sub
Grants Category under Part A of the project.

13.    The three original project components will receive additional financing under the AF
2013 (details in Annex 3):

      a) Component 1: Implementation of provincial HIV/AIDS Action Plans (GBP 3.60
         million/USD 5.79 million). Support will be provided to the 32 provinces and cities. The
         provinces will be allocated block grants based on specific criteria to determine the size of
         each year's allocation. Proposed activities are expected to reflect the diversity of
         provincial needs as well as the different responses needed in each location. One more
         vulnerable population (men having sex with men) will be provided with intervention
         support in the form of commodities distribution.


                                                   9
    b) Component 2: National HIV/AIDS Policy and Program (GBP 1.26 million/USD 2.03
       million). This component will strengthen capacity at the national and provincial levels,
       and promote the development of innovative, effective prevention through condom
       promotion and needle exchange programs. Opiate substitution therapy in the form of
       methadone maintenance therapy will also be scaled up with the technical support of
       WHO.

    c) Component 3: Project Management (GBP 0.97 million/USD 1.56 million). This
       component will provide support to 32 provincial Project Management Units (PPMUs) in
       the 32 project provinces. It will also provide support to the institutions that will manage
       and implement the project, such as the Central Project Management Unit (in the Ministry
       of Health), Provincial AIDS Steering Committees and other implementing agencies.

15.    Procurement: The procurement process under the AF will apply the revised World Bank
Guidelines of 2011 (of Goods, Non-consulting services and Consultants' services): "Procurement
of Goods, Works and Non-consulting Services under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits & Grants"
dated January 2011 (Procurement Guidelines, January 2011); and "Selection and Employment of
Consultants under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits & Grants" dated January 2011 (Consultant
Guidelines, January 2011), and the provisions stipulated in the Amended Grant Agreement.

16.    The procurement under Category 1 (provincial sub-grants) focuses on continuing the
financing to provincial project management units, peer educators and training workshops
(advocacy, training of health workers, workshop on lessons learned, etc.) and the continued
implementation of the provincial HIV prevention plans. These activities will be implemented in
accordance with the procedures and guidelines outlined in the Project’s Operations Manual.

17.      In addition, the AF will finance the purchase of goods and technical consulting services
(social marketing for condoms) under Category 1. With regard to the use of the 2011
Guidelines, the Bank Team will ensure procurement training and support to project staff on
application of the new Guidelines, and strengthen the capacity to carry out procurement at both
the central and provincial levels. For each contract to be financed by the AF, the different
procurement methods or consultant selection methods, estimated costs, prior review
requirements and time frame are agreed between the Recipient and the World Bank in the
Procurement Plan for the whole period of the AF (see Annex 4). The Procurement Plan may be
updated as needed to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in
institutional capacity.

18.     Management costs of the Additional Financing will be reduced below levels that have
been the norm thus far. Fewer Central Project Management Unit (CPMU) staff will be supported
and it has been agreed that combining some management functions with other CPMUs (i.e. those
supported by the Global Fund and the US Government) will be an appropriate cost-cutting
                                                       11
measure. Program management at the provincial level will be rationalized and standardized, with
responsibility vested in the Provincial AIDS Committee (PAC). This will result in a greater
proportion of management costs that will be borne by provinces from their own general
resources.

19.    Changes to the institutional arrangements: No changes are proposed.

IV. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

20.     The proposed changes are not expected to have major effects on the original economic,
financial, technical, institutional, or social aspects of the project as appraised. The project will
continue to provide harm reduction services for most at risk and vulnerable populations. The
project will continue to address important HIV prevention challenges and focus on ensuring
sustainability of project activities by other grant mechanisms and involving the private sector and
the government together for low cost implementation mechanisms. In particular, it should help to
continue the focus on HIV prevention activities for vulnerable populations at highest risk of HIV
transmission and acquisition.

21.     The proposed activities under the AF will not trigger any additional safeguard policies.
The Environmental Management Plan and Indigenous Peoples Plan prepared for the original
project will continue to be applicable for the AF.

22.    There are no Bank policy exceptions that need to be approved for the Additional
Financing request to be approved. There are also no waivers of Bank policies that need to be
made or approved by the Board.

23.    The overall risk to achieving the PDO is rated as “moderate.? The rating reflects the
uncertainty in implementing all of the planned sustainability measures for project activities.

         ANNEX 3: ACTIVITIES TO BE IMPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL FINANCING IN 2013


All activities in the extension year would be focused on sustainability and be conducted in close
collaboration with other programmes such as those funded by Global Fund, USG, the UN agencies and
the National Targeted Program (NTP).

Management costs need to be reduced below levels that have been the norm in previous years. Fewer
CPMU staff will be supported, and it is suggested that combining some functions with other CPMUs
(i.e. those supported by Global Fund and US Government) will be an appropriate cost-cutting measure.
Programme management at provincial level needs to be rationalized and standardized, with
responsibility vested in the PAC. A greater proportion of management costs needs to be borne by
provinces from their own general resources.

Priority activities to be supported would be:

1. Harm reduction for people who inject drugs

Considering the epidemiology of HIV in Vietnam, this needs to be the foremost priority. The following
activities should be supported:

i) Continuation of existing needle and syringe programmes in all 32 provinces, including procurement
   of needles/syringes and support for existing peer educator networks. This will be for the first 6
   months of 2013, after which all districts with larger numbers of IDUs will be transferred to Global
   Fund funding, including the peer educators. Districts with fewer IDUs will be transferred to the
   NTP.

Before a final decision on selection of districts is made, the cut-off point for number of IDUs in a
district needs to be agreed and provinces should re-estimate IDUs numbers in districts where it could be
expected that numbers may exceed current estimates. Needles/syringes may be procured in 2012 to
ensure no stock-outs during the transition to the extension period.

ii) In some provinces the development of a more sustainable model for provision of clean needles and
    syringes (N/S) for IDUs in the long term should be piloted, working with the private sector. The
    supply of free N/S through government channels would be greatly reduced to the level that can be
    domestically financed. This approach will be prioritised in urban areas in better resourced
    provinces. A variety of approaches may be tried, including more work with pharmacies, other
    potential retail outlets and social marketing.

iii) During this extension period it would be appropriate to provide additional training for peer
     educators with the explicit objective of increasing rates of HIV testing for IDUs and early detection
     and treatment of HIV positive IDUs.

iv) Continued funding of methadone clinics currently supported by DFID/WB can be considered for
    the first 6 months of 2013, after which these should be taken on by the Global Fund. The
    methadone itself will continue to be provided through PEPFAR funding during this period.


                                                   22
2. Condom social marketing through private sector providers for vulnerable populations

The new approach currently being rolled out through private sector contracts in each province needs
more time to establish a sustainable model. This should be continued throughout 2013 and will be taken
on by the Global Fund in 2014. The approach needs to continue to move the emphasis away from
traditional outlets with more and more condoms being made available through non-traditional outlets.
Arrangements for smooth handover need to be put in place during 2013.

The independent external evaluation, being funded separately by DFID and to be completed within
2012, will look at the social marketing model in detail. Recommendations of the evaluation should be
used to make appropriate modifications to the model in 2013.

Continuation of existing sex work programmes for both venue-based and street based sex workers will
be supported in all 32 provinces, including procurement of condoms for free distribution to CSW and
support for existing peer educator networks. This will be for the first 6 months of 2013, after which all
districts with larger numbers of CSW will be transferred to Global Fund funding, including the peer
educators. Districts with fewer CSW will be transferred to the NTP.

3. Work among MSM

The epidemic among MSM appears to be growing, with the limited survey data available suggesting
prevalence rates now higher than for IDUs. And yet there is still very limited knowledge of MSM
networks, behaviors and sero-prevalence in most provinces. Working in collaboration with PEPFAR-
funded activities, further work in developing effective approaches to work among MSM should be
supported in selected provinces, primarily focusing on major urban centers.

Activities to be supported should include procurement and distribution of condoms and lubricants,
support for peer educators, support for networking activities such as meetings and the piloting of
innovative approaches (e.g. some funding for basic operating costs of local MSM organizations and
training for MSM in areas such as how to set up and manage an organization). This will be for the 12
months of 2013, after which all districts with MSM activities will be transferred to Global Fund
funding in 2014. Arrangements for smooth handover need to be put in place during 2013.

As far as possible, condoms and lubricants should be made available through commercial and/or social
marketing channels. Free distribution will be kept to a minimum and highly targeted towards the most
vulnerable (e.g. street-based male sex workers).

Activities to improve syndromic management of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and reporting
of male STIs by key public and private STI providers in 10 provinces will be continued in the 10 pilot
provinces. In addition to this current support for syndromic management of male and female STIs, the
network of STI clinics will be trained on management of STIs in MSM to create some ‘MSM-friendly’
STI providers. This activity will be for the first 6 months of 2013, after which activities will be
transferred to the NTP.




                                                   23
4. Strengthening M&E

Further support is needed to help provinces improve their data management and analysis, and to ensure
that all the required routine data are recorded. This can include support for online reporting. Before
agreeing what to fund in 2013, a strategy for the location of a sustainable domestic capacity in M&E
needs to be agreed. Some capacity building and technical assistance will need to be provided in 2013.
Support for M&E will be for the national system, not just for the 32 supported provinces. However, in-
province support will not be provided for other provinces, except for the D28 upgrade.

5. Capacity building and advocacy

A range of training activities supporting areas 1 to 5 above will be supported. This should include
interprovincial learning activities including workshops and in-country study tours. International study
tours will not be supported unless there is a very compelling case for them. Attendance at international
meetings and conferences will only be supported if there is a strong case and the Vietnamese
participants will be presenting papers on the Vietnam experience.

This can include capacity building for various national bodies including the National Committee for
AIDS, Drugs and Prostitution Control, the National Assembly and key ministries such as Ministry of
Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA), Public Security and Justice. The aim will be to
strengthen the enabling legal framework and policy environment for effective HIV prevention. The
focus of the limited advocacy work undertaken under this project will be on the promotion of the
effectiveness of combination prevention. The emphasis should be on developing, analyzing and
publishing the data, e.g. documenting the decreasing HIV prevalence in those IDUs targeted by the
programme. The widespread implementation of needle and syringe program, Methadone Maintenance
Therapy (MMT) linked to HIV diagnosis and treatment has been dramatically effective in lowering
HIV rates with no evidence of increasing numbers of new drug users, and all this at a time when the
numbers of residents in 06 Centers is at a five year low. This material can be used to advocate for
appropriate strategies and budget allocations, especially at the provincial level. The project could fund a
series of workshops or debates that focus on evidence-based approaches to key issues in HIV
prevention.
