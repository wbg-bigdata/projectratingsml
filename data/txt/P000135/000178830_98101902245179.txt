INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOTSWANA
FOR A THIRD ROAD PROJECT
1. *I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Botswana for the equivalent of-US$5.8 million to help
finance a third road project. The loan would have a term of 23 years, includ-
ing 3 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Development Strategy
in a Mineral-led Economy" (735-BT) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on May 30, 1975. A small economic mission is now visiting
Botswana to assess the extent to which the economic outlook described
in the last economic report has been affected by recent developments in
the mining sector, the resumption of beef exportation to the European
Economic Community (para. 8), and the devaluation of the South African
rand on September 22, 1975 from US$1.40 to US$1.15. Country data based
on the last economic report are given in Annex I.
3.        Botswana is a landlocked country, which lies at the center of
southern Africa. Although it is the size of France, the population in 1974
was only 670,000, of which about 75 percent was concentrated in the eastern
region. Starting from a very low level of income per capita, Botswana has
one of the fastest growing economies in Africa.
4.        The climate is largely semi-arid and rainfall is highly erratic,
resulting in frequent droughts. Water in the eastern region, which comes
primarily from boreholes, dams and seasonal rivers, could become a serious
constraint to development. In the sparsely populated northwest of the
country, however, the Okavango delta represents a large source of surface
water which flows in from Angola. The complex hydrology and ecology of this
region is being intensively studied as part of the Government's long-term
plan for water development.
5.        The country is well endowed with mineral resources of which
diamonds, nickel, copper and coal are currently being exploited. Less than
10 percent of the land area has a good potential for arable agriculture;
more than half of the country is covered by a savanna type vegetation suitable
only for grazing. Traditionally, the economy has been dominated by livestock
production and subsistence agriculture. The main crops are sorghum, maize,
millet, beans and cowpeas - all of which are grown largely for subsistence



consumption. It is estimated that 80 percent of the population depends on
agriculture and cattle rearing for their livelihood. There is evidence that
income distribution is highly skewed. The Government is committed to achieving
a more equitable distribution of income and is presently conducting, with Bank
Group assistance, a survey of income distribution.
6.        Together with Lesotho, South Africa and Swaziland, Botswana belongs
to the Southern Africa Customs Union which was established in 1910, and which
provides for the free movement of goods between member countries. Under this
Union, all customs excise and sales duties are paid into a common revenue
pool and allocated to members mainly in relation to the value of their imports
and excisable production. The revision of this agreement in 1969 has resulted
in a four-fold increase in government receipts from the pool over the last
five years. These countries also comprise the rand monetary area, but
Botswana has recently established a Central Bank and may in due course issue
its own currency.
7.        Infrastructure is at an early stage of development.    Most of the
road system is unengineered and less than 150 km of the 5,000 km of main
roads are bituminous-surfaced. Feeder and rural roads are often little more
than tracks. Investments are being concentrated in upgrading the vital
north/south road axis (about 690 km) to bituminous standards. Existing air-
fields cannot yet accomodate jet aircraft but airport communications and
other facilities are being upgraded to international standards. The main
railway line is owned and operated by Rhodesia Railways and passes from
Rhodesia through eastern Botswana for 640 km before connecting with the
South African railway system. With public utilities generally available in
the main urban centers, the extension of these facilities to the rural popu-
lation appears as a government priority.
8.        The impetus to economic growth began with substantial mining invest-
ments towards the end of the 1960's and continued later with the production of
diamonds in 1971 and copper/nickel in 1973. Since 1969/70, the rate of
growth of GDP in constant prices has been about 20 percent per annum and GDP
per capita rose from $210 in 1971/72 to about $300 in 1973/74. This growth
of the economy since 1971 has been export-propelled. The value of minerals
in external trade was negligible prior to 1971 but is estimated at about R 40
million in 1974/75 or just over half of Botswana's merchandise exports. At
the same time, the strong demand for beef, both in the Republic of South
Africa and in the United Kingdom, resulted in an expansion of agricultural
output through an increased offtake of the national herd. While meat and
meat products have now been overtaken by minerals as the country's main com-
modity, they still represent: almost 40 percent of merchandise exports and
continue to be an important source of foreign exchange earnings. These ex-
ports were adversely affected in July 1974 when the European Economic Com-
munity (EEC), which received about 70 percent of Botswana's meat exports,
banned all meat imports as a result of oversupply conditions. During the ban,



- 3 -
however, Botswana was able to keep its livestock industry viable by signifi-
cantly increasing its beef exports to South Africa. The ban was lifted on
June 26, 1975, but an import levy was then imposed which reportedly affected
the profitability of Botswana's livestock industry. In July 1975, however,
the EEC suspended 90 percent of the levy applicable to imports from Botswana
while discussions on the application of the levy are in process.
9.        Between 1969/70 and 1973/74 government revenues increased from
R 11 million to R 42 million, mainly because of increased allocations from
the Customs Union, direct taxation and mining revenues. Government current
expenditures expanded to R 28 million by an average of 16 percent per annum,
but jumped by 50 percent in 1974/75 following a revision of the salaries of
government employees. The Government is now in a position to finance from
its revenue surplus up to 20 percent of its development expenditures which
hitherto had to be fully financed from external sources. Capital expenditures
increased from R3.3 million in 1968/69 to about R 34 million in 1974/75.
10.       Botswana's development objectives were summarized in 1972 in the
five year National Development Plan (NDP) (1973-78) as follows: (a) rapid
economic growth; (b) social justice, defined as achieving a more equitable
distribution of income and providing equal opportunities for all Batswana in
education and employment; (c) economic independence, particularly the diver-
sification of the country's external, economic and trade relations, and the
localization of skilled manpower; and (d) sustained production while conserving
the natural environment. The Government's strategy is based on the utiliza-
tion of mining revenue to finance investments in infrastructure, education
and training, agriculture and rural services, in order to ensure that the
large rural population benefits from economic growth. In this regard, an
accelerated rural development program was launched in 1973 with inter-
national assistance.
11.       The NDP called for an investment program equivalent to 30 percent
of GDP and public capital expenditures of R 212 million in 1974 prices over
the 1973-78 period. Infrastructure investments were to account for about
60 percent of planned expenditure while education and social services,
particularly in the rural areas, were expected to be progressively expanded
and to receive about 13 percent of planned allocations. Given the size and
low level of infrastructural development, the acute shortage of skilled man-
power, and the need to modernize the traditional sector, these allocations of
investments appear to be well directed. So far, the Government has executed
its development program satisfactorily. On the whole, planning, hitherto
largely project-oriented, has been effective. Attention is now correctly
being given to the formulation of long-term strategies based on more compre-
hensive economic planning.
12.       The NDP set targets for an annual increase in GDP and employment
of 14 percent and 9 percent, respectively, while GDP per capita was projected
to increase from $175 in 1971 to about $330 in 1978. It is likely that these
growth targets could be exceeded despite some reduction in copper/nickel
production as a result of technical difficulties at the Shashe mining complex
(para 17), and the fall in livestock exports.



- 4 -
13.       The major constraint to the Plan's implementation is a shortage
of professional and technical skills. At Independence in 1966, the country
inherited a situation in which the general levels of education and skills
were low, with illiteracy estimated at 75 percent of the adult population.
Government plans call for a rapid expansion in education and training at all
levels, so as to substitute local staff for expatriates as rapidly as possible
in the technical and professional positions in both the private and public
sectors. However, the need for additional skilled manpower will become even
more pressing, necessitating an increased reliance on expatriates and a step-up
in the level of educational investment. With respect to the availability of
semi-skilled labor, the future growth of the economy is expected to result in
a reduction in the proportion of workers migrating to South Africa.
14.       If appropriate measures and policies are adopted, the following
favorable features of the economy should emerge over the plan period: (a)
real GDP and GNP growth at an annual rate of about 14percent; (b) domestic
savings of the order of 30 percent of GDP; (c) public investment expenditure
in line with NDP targets; and (d) an increase in public savings allowing for
a continuing transfer from the current budget surplus to the Government's
investment program. Such developments, however, will be accompanied by a
number of difficulties which call for specific action: (a) urbanization
is expected to grow at 16 percent annually, with an accompanying rise in
urban unemployment and income inequality; (b) the demand for skilled manpower
will increase and will call for a greater emphasis on education; and (c)
further deterioration of grazing lands will take place, unless firm measures
to control grazing are implemented. It will be necessary for the Government
to effect a greater control over the rate of growth of incomes, particularly
for mine workers and government employees.
15.       The country has been well served so far by multilateral and bilateral
agencies with substantial assistance on very soft terms. The Bank Group has
been the main multilateral lender, and bilateral assistance has been well
diversified, the main sources being the United Kingdom, Canada, United States,
Germany and the Scandinavian countries. Disbursements amounted to an average
of about $35 million per arnum over the last three years. Total disbursed
public debt amounted to $129 million at December 31, 1974. Service payments
on debt during 1974 were $3.0 million, or less than 5 percent of export
earnings. Disbursed debt is projected at about $440 million in 1980, of
which IBRD would account for about $85 million, with service payments of
about $26 million; this would be equivalent to 10 percent of current revenue
and 5 percent of export earnings. Botswana now has the institutions through
which the mobilization of resources could be significantly improved, and
consequently, domestic borrowing should become a more regular feature of its
development financing. However, the country will still need external
assistance, both technical and capital, which it can now afford to contract
on less concessionary terms.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BOTSWANA
16.       Bank Group operations in Botswana commenced with a road project in
1964. To date there have been eight projects, financed by six IDA credits
amounting to about $15 million, and two IBRD loans totalling $41 .5 million
(net of cancellations). The credits have financed two road projects, a water
supply project, a livestock project, engineering studies on the infrastructure
relating to the Shashe mining complex, and an urban project. The loans have
helped finance the Shashe infrastructure project and a development finance
company. As of December 31, 1974, the Bank Group's share in Botswana's exter-
nal public debt (disbursed and undisbursed) was 32 percent (of which the
share of IBRD was 24 percent), while its share in Botswana's debt service
payments in 1974 was 65 percent - a relatively high figure reflecting the
predominance of soft funds in Botswana's external debt. However, over 90 per-
cent of the debt service payments to the Bank Group were also accounted for by
the Shashe infrastructure project which was guaranteed by the mining companies
concerned. For 1980, the Bank Group's share in the country's external public
debt and its debt service payments is estimated at 25 and 28 percent respec-
tively. A summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to Botswana is
given in Annex II, together with notes on the execution of on-going projects.
No IFC loans or investments have been made in Botswana.
17.       Overall, the Botswana Government and its agencies have demonstrated
good performance in the planning and execution of development projects. Of
particular note is the completion on schedule of the major parts of the large
Shashe infrastructure project. Implementation of the projects now under ex-
ecution is generally proceeding well. The major technical problems that have
beset the Bamangwato Concessions Limited mining project associated with the
Shashe infrastructure project now appear to be in hand and rated capacity
may be reached by mid-1976. Under present financial arrangements, the large
increase in capital costs of the mining project could result in a substantial
reduction in the benefits (royalties, taxes and dividends) to be received by
the Government. The Government is concerned about this possibility and is
seeking ways to safeguard the benefits the mining project was expected to
provide. The Bank has been studying various financial and technical possi-
bilities for improving the financial prospects of the project and has been
assisting the Government and private companies involved to arrive at an under-
standing. No general agreement has yet been arrived at on resolving the
financial issues, but further meetings between the parties are planned during
the next few months.
18.       We propose to continue our active support for the Government's
development plan. Three projects are now being prepared: a) an education
project that will focus on rural technical education, secondary education
and teacher training; b) a fourth road project that will finance the improve-
ment of a 150 km section of Botswana's main north-south road; and c) a second
livestock project that is expected to encompass major changes in land tenure
in tribal areas. In addition, assistance is being considered for the pro-
posed development of a township and infrastructure to support a large soda



- 6 -
and soda ash project based on brine deposits at Sua Pan. We also hope to
continue our support for medium-scale industrial growth through the Botswana
Development Corporation and to give some additional help to the Government
for meeting the mushrooming urban problem which the country faces.
PART III - TRANSPORT SECTOR
19.       Transport facilities in Botswana are limited.   The country's trans-
port system consists of a sparse network of roads and tracks, a railway
line in the eastern portion of the country, and a considerable number of
widely scattered airports or airstrips. A small ferry operates across the
Zambezi River between Kazungula in Botswana, and Zambia. As a consequence
of settlement patterns, transport development has been concentrated in the
eastern tenth of the country where about 75 percent of the population live.
20.       The main railway system extends along the 640 km length of eastern
Botswana and links two large trading partners, South Africa and Rhodesia.
It is presently owned, operated and maintained by the Rhodesian Railway
Corporation. In addition, various railway spurs totalling 70 km have been
built by Botswana to facilitate mineral transport, but these are also
maintained and operated by Rhodesia Railways.
21.       Botswana's main road runs north-south between Lobatse and Nata
(690 km) paralleling the railway line for much of the distance. Most of the
5,000 km of main roads are dry-weather gravel and earth; less than 150 km
are bituminous-surfaced and only about 830 km are all-weather gravel-surfaced.
This position, however, represents a substantial improvement since Independence
in 1966, when there were only about 430 km of all-weather roads in the country.
In addition, there is a rural network of earth and sand tracks estimated at
about 11,340 km, only 3,000 km of which have been inventoried.
22.       Air transport services have been developed to help integrate
widely scattered settlements into the life of the country. In 1972, Air
Botswana was established as a para-statal corporation to provide domestic
and international services by sub-contracting to private operators. Sched-
uled domestic flights serve most population centers. International sched-
uled air services link Botswana with South Africa and Zambia.
23.       The Bank Group has had two previous road projects in Botswana and
an infrastructure project with a road component. First, US$3.6 million was
made available in 1964 (Credit 63-BEC) for: (a) design, construction,
and reconstruction of three roads to gravel standards (570 km); (b) selected
betterment of the North-South road; and (c) improvement and expansion of the
maintenance organization. The project was completed on time in 1968 within
cost estimates but the economic benefits realized from the project have been
somewhat less than those originally envisaged. The second was co-financed
by an IDA credit (Credit 303-BT) of US$2 million and a SIDA credit of about
US$4 million equivalent. This project consisted of: (a) reconstruction
and paving of the 84 km Pioneer Gate-Lobatse-Gaborone-Sebele section of the
North-South road; (b) consulting services for the detailed engineering of



the road and construction supervision; and (c) technical assistance to the
Roads Branch of the Public Works Department. These works were also satis-
factorily completed ahead of schedule and within cost estimates. The IBRD
loan for the Shashe infrastructure project includes construction of the 52 km
Seruli-Pikwe road to bituminous standards. Completion of this road is ex-
pected by mid-19760
24.       The Ministry of Works and Communications (MWC) is responsible for
the trunk and main roads and -air transport, and has a section dealing with
railways. The organization is basically satisfactory. Within the Ministry,
a Planning Unit was established in 1972 to prepare and continuously update
the national transport plan, and to assist the Ministry of Finance and
Development Planning, which is responsible for national planning and coordina-
tion. As the Unit has only three professional-level people, it is limited
in its ability to undertake comprehensive long-term planning. The Department
of Roads in the MWC has four major branches: Data and Planning, Development,
Maintenance, and Rural Roads. The Maintenance Branch is sub-divided into the
Northern, Southern and Western regions, each headed by a Roads Engineer. All
senior posts in the Maintenance Branch are filled by expatriates provided
under bilateral assistance. However, due to a shortage of skilled technical
staff, this branch presently has only enough capacity to carry out minimal
road maintenance. The Bank Group has provided some assistance for road
maintenance under a previous road project, but further strengthening of
the Maintenance Branch is required to enable it to meet the demands imposed
by the rapid expansion and upgrading of the main road network. The Development
Branch is basically limited in its design capacity to roads whose size and
complexity are similar to the Gaborone-Molepolole road presently being proposed.
Its capacity is unlikely to increase significantly until the present shortage
of skilled technicians, surveyors, and soils technicians is rectified. The
Department does not have any capacity for road construction. It therefore
has to contract the work to international firms since there are presently
no Botswana contractors large enough to undertake this work, again because
of a general lack of trained engineers, technicians and managers. In view
of the present constraints of the Department of Roads, an important focus
of the proposed project will be to strengthen the Department by preparing a
maintenance program and providing staff training and equipment (para. 33).
25.       The District Councils, under the Ministry of Local Government and
Lands (MLGL), are responsible for the estimated 11,340 km of district roads.
The Councils presently have few or no facilities for road maintenance, and the
condition of these roads, which is very poor, continues to deteriorate. Under
an on-going project with assistance from the Norwegian Agency for Development
(NORAD), about 900 km of the network are to be reconstructed or improved.
The proposed project also includes assistance for strengthening the Central
District Council's capacity to maintain and improve rural roads.
26.       The Central Transport Organization (CTO) under the Ministry of
Works and Communications provides and maintains all equipment and vehicles
hired out to ministries and government agencies. The CTO's inadequate
workshops and equipment, combined with faulty management procedures, have
resulted in a 30 percent equipment availabi4ity rate and consequent in-
efficient road maintenance operations. The Government has recently obtained
an expert provided by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)



to serve as the Chief Executive of the CTO and make recommendations for the
improvement of the organization. Assurances have been obtained that the Bor-
rower will prepare a program acceptable to the 'Bank for the improvement of the
structure and operations oi the CTO, and substantially complete the implementa-
tion of the program by December 31, 1978 (Section 4005, Loan Agreement).
27.       The current national transport plan is an integral part of the
National Development Plan, in which transport development is given high prior-
ity, and provides an adequate basis for short-term development programs. Long-
term planning is hamperedl by thse fluidity of the political situation in
southern Africa and the uncertainty of the deveLopment prospects of various
mineral resources. As it is not immediately needed, the Government intends
to undertake the preparation of a more comprehensive, long-term, national
transport plan at a later stage in the Plan period. In 197J, the Government
enacted legislation concerning entry into the road transport industry and
vehicle licensing, weights and dimensions. This legislation was timely,
because ircreased mining activity is expected to generate heavy vehicle loads.
28.       Botswana's present transport policy has two general aims:   to meet
current demands by more efficient use of existing transport resources; and
to expand these resources to meet future demands. Demand for transport
facilities is being accentuated by the rapid growth in mineral ventures
together with new industrial and agricultural developments. The Government
recognizes that the railway will continue to play a significant role and has
indicated its intention to take over the operation of the Rhodesian-owned
railway. New rail links will be required with the growth in mining develop-
ment, and one such link is presently being planned to jolt Francistown and
Dukwe to facilitate the development of the Sua F'an brine deposits.
29.       The Government's road development plans give high priority to the
improvement of the arterial North-South road between Lobatse and Nata (690 km)
and from Nata to Kasungula (360 kn). The rapid increase in traffic due to
the mineral development at Orapa and Shashe, the growth in trade with Zambia,
the growth of the regional centers in the eastern corridor, and the promising
mineral, industrial and agricultural prospects In the north-east and north-
west make the improvemeni: of this road of high Lmportancec The Government
has made a concerted effort to obtain external, financing for this road, and
all sections are either improved, under construction, or planned for construc-
tion within the next three years.   Bilateral ass.stance has been received
from a number of agencieS; including the Gaborone-Molepolole road construction
under the proposed project, some 1,112 km of truink and main roads in the
eastern corridor and in :he north are to be newLy constructed or improved to
all-weather gravel or bituminous standards at an estimated cost of about
$50 million equivalent over the next four to five years.   Although this
appears to be an ambitious undertaking, there are substantial indications
that the necessary bilateral assistance will be forthcoming.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       A report entitled "Botswana - Appraisal of a Third Road Project"
No.896-BT, dated October 16,1975, is being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. A loan and project summary is provided as Annex III.
31.       In early 1973, the Government commenced discussions with the Bank
regarding a third road project and a pre-appraisal mission visited Botswana
in September/October 1973. The project was appraised in the field in
January 1975 and negotiations were held in Washington from September 8 to 11,
1975. The Botswana delegation was led by Mr. Festus Mogae, Permanent Secre-
tary, Ministry of Finance and Development Planning.
Objectives and Description of the Project
32.       The objectives of the proposed project are to assist the Government
in developing the road network, planning and organizing district and main road
maintenance, strengthening the Department of Roads, and enforcing vehicle
weight and dimensions legislation.
33.       The project will consist of the following:
(a)  construction of the Gaborone-Molepolole road (52 km) to
two-lane bituminous standards. This road will link
Molepolole, the administrative and commercial center of
Kweneng District, with the capital, Gaborone, and connect
with the recently completed Molepolole-Letlhakeng district
road to form the District's road artery. It will replace
an existing earth and gravel road which is difficult to
traverse during the rainy season and would significantly
reduce user and road maintenance costs. Detailed engineer-
ing has been prepared by the Department of Roads and is
satisfactory;
(b) consulting services to:
(i) supervise construction of the Gaborone-Molepolole
road, review its designs, and assist the Government
in bidding procedures and evaluation;
(ii) prepare detailed engineering for the Mahalapye-
Serule section (150 km) of the arterial North-South
road. This section is presently constructed to
earth standards, making it impassable during heavy
rains;
(iii) carry out a Road Maintenance Study through which
a five-year road maintenance program for all
gazetted roads, based on economic priority



- 10 -
ranking, will be prepared. Resources, equipment,
trained staff, materials and funds needed for
implementation of the maintenance program would be
identified and recommendations made on meeting any
shortfall;
(c) a District Road Maintenance Pilot Program, comprising technical
assistance and equipment. As part of the Road Maintenance
Study, consultants will prepare a pilot program for the Central
District, which has about 4,500 km of district roads. Organi-
zational and operational procedures will be set up for the
betterment, rehabilitation, and maintenance of these roads,
and the MLGL, through the Central District Council, will
implement them. At government request, two road maintenance
units, mainly geared to labor-intensive methods, and technical
assistance will be made available under the project. The
appropriate blend of labor and equipment for the various
operations will be identified during the program and even-
tually applied to other districts;
(d) strengthening of the Department of Roads through staff
training and provision of soils laboratory equipment.
Roads Department staff will be trained in soils and
material technology, road maintenance operations and
techniques, and accounting and cost control systems;
soils laboratory equipment will also be provided. These
measures should significantly increase the Department
of Roads' capability to carry out soils and road materials
investigations and site control testing, leading to more
efficient use of local materials for road maintenance; and
(e) loadometers and weighbridges and their installation, to
enable the Government to enforce vehicle weight and
dimensions legislation.
Cost Estimates and Financing
34.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$7.4 million equiva-
lent, excluding taxes and duties amounting to US$0.4 million equivalent. A
detailed breakdown of costs is given in Annex III. About US$6.3 million, or
86 percent of the project cost, would be for expenditures on goods and services
outside Botswana. The proposed loan of US$5.8 million would cover about 92
percent of these expenditures, or about 78 percent of total project costs, net
of taxes and duties. The balance would be financed by the Government.



Project Execution
35.       The Department of Roads will be responsible for executing road
construction, securing consulting services and training, and for procuring
soils laboratory equipment, weighbridges, and loadometers. After installa-
tion, the weighbridges and loadometers will be operated by the Traffic
Police. The MLGL, through the Central District Council, will be responsible
for executing the District Road Maintenance Pilot Program, recruiting tech-
nical assistance experts, and procuring road maintenance equipment.
36.       The road construction contract is expected to be awarded in early
1976 and the work completed by mid-1977. The road runs through tribal land,
but since the Government has the right of eminent domain, no problems in
acquiring land for the right-of-way are expected. The soils laboratory
equipment, weighbridges, and loadometers are expected to be purchased by
April 1976, and the contract for district road maintenance equipment should
be awarded by January 1977. Detailed engineering of the Mahalapye-Serule
road and the Road Maintenance Study should start in early 1976 and be completed
by early 1977. The District Road Maintenance Pilot Program is to be prepared
during the first phase of the Road Maintenance Study, and implementation is
expected to start during the second half of 1977. Assurances have been
obtained that the Borrower will adequately maintain its trunk and main roads
and the district roads of the Central District included in the Pilot Program
(Section 4.03, Loan Agreement). In addition, to ensure the proper planning
of the maintenance, improvements and extension of its road system, assurances
have been obtained that the Borrower will take all measures necessary to
improve the procedures of collecting and recording traffic data in accordance
with appropriate statistical methods and procedures (Section 4.04, Loan
Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
37.       The road construction contract will be awarded and the road main-
tenance equipment procured after international competitive bidding, in accord-
ance with Bank Group procurement guidelines. Soils laboratory equipment,
weighbridges, and loadometers will be procured under standard Government pro-
curement procedures, which are satisfactory for these relatively minor items.
Assurances have been obtained that consultants and technical assistance experts
for the Roads Department and the MLGL will be employed under terms of refer-
ence and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (Section 3.02, Loan Agreement).
The specific maintenance equipment needed for the District Road Maintenance
Pilot Program will be identified by the technical assistance experts and ap-
proved by the Bank.
38.       The Bank would disburse against 70 percent of the total cost of
civil works, 80 percent of the total cost of consulting services and staff
training, and 100 percent of the foreign costs of all equipment and vehicles.

Justification
39.       The Gaborone-Molepolole road serves approximately 4,000 km2
and about 60,000 people in the Kweneng District, who are mostly small
farmers engaged in cattle-raising and crop cultivation. Gaborone and
Molepolole are the major market centers for the area's farm produce.
Molepolole, which has small cottage industries and an increasing number of
trading establishments, is a gateway to the Kalahari Desert and the western
parts of Botswana. The Government plans to improve livestock raising
practices and marketing in the area, and is constructing the requisite
facilities at Letlhakeng which is linked to Molepolole by a recently com-
pleted district road. The Kweneng Rural Development Association plans to
expand its cottage industries in Molepolole, and in 1974 the District Council
approved a proposal to build an industrial estate there. In 1974, mineral
exploration in Kweneng resulted in the discovery of substantial coal resources
which are likely to become an important factor in the local economy. Also,
tourism is expected to increase, principally in the Khutse Game Reserve about
160 km northwest of Molepolole, and the Government plans to develop tourist
facilities there. These developments would all be assisted by improving the
Gaborone-Molepolole Road. The construction of the road is expected to yield
a 17 percent economic return. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out,
assuming an economic life of 20 years, showing that in the event of unfavorable
variations in construction costs, traffic growth or vehicle operating costs,
the economic return would not fall below 14 percent.
40.       The benefits of the other project components have not been quantified;
however, it is expected that they will be considerable. The detailed engineer-
ing of the Mahalapye-Serule portion of the North-South road is of particular
importance, given the rapid growth in mineral, industrial and agricultural
developments in the eastern corridor.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Botswana and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving
the proposed loan, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
42.       Features of the Loan Agreement of special interest are referred
to in paragraphs 26, 36 and 37 of this report.
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. 233      Gaborone-Lobatse Water Supply Project: $3.0 million
credit of February 10, 1971; Closing Date: March 31, 1976
The project was substantially completed in August, 1974,
about two years late, but the settling of claims and
counterclaims and the purchase of additional equipment
with a small sum likely to be left over in the Credit
may delay actual completion until early 1976. The
Closing Date has been extended for a second time to
March 31, 1976. The delays, which were caused primarily
by the poor performance of the civil works contractors,
did not cause any water shortages since rainfall was good.
The Water Utilities Corporation, which was created about
the time the project commenced, has developed into a
strong institution and is performing well.
Loan No. 776        Shashe Infrastructure Project:   $32 million loan of
June 29, 1971; Closing Date: November 1, 1975;
$5.5 million supplemental loan of June 7, 1974
Work on the infrastructure project as originally envisaged
was completed on schedule and the project is operational.
A later decision to bituminize the Seruli-Pikwe road has
left this one contract outstanding and, therefore, the
loan of $37.5 million is not expected to be fully dis-
bursed before end-1976. Work on the Seruli-Pikwe
road is scheduled to be completed by end-1976. There
are still a few teething troubles, the most significant
being the difficulties encountered in the use of local
Morupule coal in the power station boilers. The Botswana
Power Corporation, however, is confident that this
problem will be rectified by end-1975.
The technical problems with the surface treatment plant
that have beset the associated Bamangwato Concessions
Limited mining project have resulted in serious cost
overruns and loss of production. The major technical
problems now appear to be in hand and rated capacity may
be reached by mid-1976. The large increase in capital

progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any pro-
blems which are being encountered and action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weak-
nesses in project execution.

costs of rhrh mIning project could result in a
substantial redu--tior. in the benefits to be received
bv thp Government. However, various financial and
technical poss-Bilities for improving the financial
prospeocs of the project are being actively explored.
Credit No. 303       Seconid Road kroject:  $2.0 million credit of April 27,
1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1976
.he road construction was substantially completed during
October 1974, about four months ahead of schedule.    However,
about ', km of the 84 km road are still under contractor
maintenance and some surface irregularities are being
remeuied.
Credit No. 325       Livastock Development Project:   $1.65 million credit of
Ju-e 30, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project is about a year behind schedule, mainly
because of the initial delay in the drilling of boreholes.
The Livestock Project Management Unit (LPMU) has recently
recruited private contractors to do the drilling, and
marked progress has been achieved by LPMU in establishing
cattle ranches in the Western State Lands. However, the
Botswana Livestock Development Corporation (BLDC)
program of establishing ranches in the Eastern Tribal
Lands is still behind schedule, with the exception of
the Makalamabedi Ranch. BLDC is also experiencing
some financial, managerial and administrative problems.
Credit No. 471       Francistown Urban Development Prolect:   $3.0 million
credit- of May 9, 1974; Closing Date:  December 31, 1978
The credit became effective on October 4, 1974. Ccn-
struction got underway in January 1975. The civil
works are progressing well and are expected to be
completed on scheduie. Other aspects of the project
are also progressing satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1019        Botswana Development Corporat.ion Proiet: $4.0 million
loan of June 27, '974; Closirg,Date: June 30, 1979
The loan became effective on December 9, 1974.    Sub-
stantial progress has been achieved by BDC in the
utilization of the funds provided under the loan.
It is expected that about 80 percent of the Loan will
be committed by the end of 1975, well ahead of schedule.
