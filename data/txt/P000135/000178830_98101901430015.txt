APPRAISAL OF A THIRD ROAD PROJECT
BOTSWANA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a road project prepared by the Botswana
Government for which a Bank loan of US$5.8 million is proposed. Government
is committing substantial resources to road transport because the country's
skeletal network is inadequate for either present or projected requirements.
Primary thrust is to develop the North-South spine, in the relatively
populous eastern corridor, and main roads to serve it.
ii.       The Bank Group has had two previous road projects in Botswana
and an infrastructure project with a road component. First, a US$3.6 million
credit was made available in 1964 (63-BEC) for:
(a) the design, construction, and reconstruction of three
roads totalling 570 kmi;
(b) selected betterment of the North-South road; and
(c) improvement and expansion of the maintenance organization.
The project was satisfactorily completed on time in 1968 within cost estimates;
however, according to an audit report, projected economic benefits were not
fully realized in the 6-year period following project completion. The second
road project was financed by an IDA credit (303-BT) of US$2 million, a Swedish
International Development Authority credit of US$4 million equivalent, and a
contribution by Government. This project consisted of:
(a) the reconstruction and paving of the 84 km Pioneer Gate-
Lobatse-Gaborone-Sebele section of the North-South road;
(b) consultant services for detailed engineering and construction
supervision; and
(c) technical assistance to the Roads Branch of the Public
Works Department.
These works were also satisfactorily completed ahead of schedule and within
cost estimates. Finally, the Bank Shashe Infrastructure Project loan
(776-BT) included construction of the 52 km Serule-Selebi-Pikwe road, which
encountered some difficulties that have since been satisfactorily resolved.
Improvement of the road to bituminous standards will be completed in 1976.



- ii -
iii.      The major component of this project is construction to bituminous
standards of a 52 km road (Gaborone-Molepolole) to connect the Kweneng
District's administrative and commercial center with the North-South road.
Government has provided for the improvement or construction of all sections
of the North-South road, except for a 150 km section (Mahalapye-Serule) whose
detailed engineering is included in the proposed project.
iv.       To assist Government in maintaining the expanding road network,
the project also includes a road maintenance study and technical assistance
and equipment for a District Road Maintenance Pilot Program.
v.        Lack of trained personnel in the Roads Department restricts road
maintenance activities. The staff training component of the proposed pro-
ject addresses this problem. The provision of soils laboratory equipment
will help the Department meet increasing maintenance demands. The weighbridges
and loadometers provided for will assist Government in enforcing recently-
enacted legislation controlling vehicle axle loads.
vi.       All project items will be executed by the Roads Department, except
for the pilot program, which will be executed by the Ministry of Local Govern-
ment and Lands through the Central District Council.
vii.      Total project cost is estimated at US$7.8 million (US$7.4 million
excluding taxes and duties). The foreign exchange component is US$6.3
million, about 81% of total project cost. The project will be financed by
a Bank loan of US$5.8 million, which will cover 78% of the total project cost
net of taxes and duties, and a US$2.0 million (US$1.6 million excluding
taxes and duties) Government contribution, as agreed during negotiations.
The Bank loan will cover about 70% of road construction costs (76% excluding
taxes and duties, but including contingencies) and the foreign cost of
consultant services, technical assistance, and equipment; no local costs
will be financed by the loan.
viii.     The road construction contract will be awarded and road maintenance
equipment procured after international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement; consultants and technical assis-
tance experts will be employed under terms of reference and conditions agreed
with the Bank. Road construction is expected to start at the beginning of
1976 and be completed by mid-1977.
ix.       The streams of costs and benefits (Table 10) indicate that the
proposed investment in the Gaborone-Molepolole road is economically sound.
It wiil yield a 17% economic return; the same return is calculated for
each of the two major road sections. The road has a first-year return
above 10% when using a 10% discount rate.



- iii -
x.        During negotiations, agreement was reached with Government on the
submission of a program and related implementation schedule for improving
the Central Transport Organization, which is responsible for all Government
equipment, including road maintenance equipment. Agreement was also reached
on the other issues set forth in paragraphs 6.01 and 6.02. The project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$5.8 million to the Republic of Botswana. An
appropriate loan term is 23 years, including a grace period of three years.






APPRAISAL OF A THIRD ROAD PROJECT
BOTSWANA
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Botswana has applied for assistance in financing
a road project whose components are described in this report (paras. 4.02-.07).
1.02      The proposed project, in line with Government's transportation
development strategy, will aid Government in expanding the all-weather road
network in an important agricultural region, in planning and organizing district
and main road maintenance, in strengthening the Roads Department, and in en-
forcing vehicle weight and dimensions legislation.
1.03      The total project cost is estimated at US$7.8 million (US$7.4
million excluding taxes and duties), with a foreign exchange component of
US$6.3 million, about 81% of total project costs. The project will be
financed by a Bank loan of US$5.8 million and a Government contribution of
US$2.0 million, or US$1.6 million excluding taxes.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission
comprising Kenneth Clare (Economist) and Brendan Kennedy (Engineer), which
visited Botswana in January 1975. The report was edited by Marie Garcia-Zamor.
2. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Effects of Geography and Economic Growth on Transport
2.01      Landlocked Botswana is a large (570,000 km ), sparsely populated,
desert country (see Map). Access to the sea is through Durban, Cape Town,
Port Elizabeth, Beira, or Lourenco Marques, each less than 1,500 km from
the capital, Gaborone. The country's topography does not present major
obstacles to construction of transport facilities, but the scarcity of water
and other construction materials caused by widespread desert conditions
adversely affects road construction.
2.02      The transport system consists of a thin network of roads and tracks,
a railway line in the east, and a considerable number of widely scattered
airports or airstrips. A small ferry operates across the Zambezi River
between Kazungula in Botswana and Zambia.



-2-
2.03      The population is nearly 700,000 and is growing at an annual rate
of 2%. Although 75% of the people live in the eastern 19% of the country,
average density there is only about eight persons per km . As a consequence
of the settlement pattern, transport development has been concentrated in
the eastern corridor.
2.04      Agriculture (primarily animal husbandry) is the largest sector
and contributed 37% of Botswana's GDP in 1973/74.  However, mining is
rapidly overtaking it as a result of mineral developments at Orapa (diamonds),
Selebi-Pikwe (copper/nickel), and Morupule (coal). Government is the third-
ranking sector and contributed 14% of GDP in 1973/74. Mineral exploitation
is almost certain to be increasingly important to the economy, based upon
proven mineral deposits, and will require considerable improvement and
expansion of transport facilities, including railway connections. While
agriculture is not expected to develop as rapidly, growth in this sector will
also stimulate demand for improved transport, especially roads. At present,
however, low density freight and passenger flows make the development of a
transport system costly.
2.05      Per capita GDP in 1973/74 was about US$300, approximately 43% above
the 1971/72 level of US$210. Real GDP, which has grown at an annual average
rate of about 20% since the late 1960's, is expected to increase at about 14%
toward the end of the 1970's and then level off at about 10% in the early 1980's.
B. The Transport System
Roads
2.06      Chapter 3 gives details of the road system.
Railway
2.07      A nineteenth century-built railway system extends the 642 km
length of eastern Botswana and links two large trading partners, the Republic
of South Africa (RSA) and Rhodesia.  It is owned, operated, and maintained
by the Rhodesian Railway Corporation which pays Botswana an annual wayleave
of US$350,000.  Rail spurs, built by the Botswana Government in 1974 under
the Bank Shashe Infrastructure Project loan;(776-BT) for mineral transport
bc_ween Serule and Selebi-Pikwe (65 km) and between Morupule and the main
railway line (14 km), are operated and maintained by Rhodesia Railways. In
1972, railway traffic was 1.3 million ton-kilometers, of which 86% was transit
traffic, 11% export/import traffic, and only 2% Botswana internal traffic.
Passengers totalled about 633,000, of whom 9% were in transit.



2.08      The North-South road runs parallel to the railway line.  However,
there is little road-rail competition because the railway is primarily a link
between RSA and Rhodesia, while the road primarily serves internal traffic.
Railway service is not well-suited to satisfying transport needs within
Botswana because the comparatively light traffic density and usually short
hauls are more suited to road transport. However, as mentioned above, mining
industry development has required construction of new rail spurs and rail-
ways are expected to play an important role in the country's transport system.
Air Transport
2.09      Government's development strategy emphasizes the need for air
connections to integrate widely scattered settlements into the life of the
country. In 1972, Air Botswana was established as a parastatal organization
wholly-owned by the Botswana Development Corporation; it provides domestic
and international services by sub-contracting to private operators. Sche-
duled domestic flights serve most Botswana population centers with Hawker
Siddeley 748 and Douglas DC-3 aircraft. International scheduled services
are provided to RSA and Zambia by Air Botswana; Zambian Airways and South
African Airways provide air service to Botswana. Approximately 37,000
passengers were handled at the Gaborone airport in FY 1973/74.
C. Transport Policy, Planning, and Coordination
2.10      Botswana's present transport policy has two general aims:  to
meet current demands by utilizing existing transport resources more efficiently
and to expand these resources to meet future demands. Government recognizes
the urgent need to integrate the country's economy. Demand for road facili-
ties is being accentuated by the rapid growth in mineral exploitation together
with new industrial and agricultural developments. While preferring to
decrease dependence on foreign-owned transport facilities, especially the
railway, Government recognizes that the railway will continue to play a
significant role and hopes to take over operations from Rhodesia in the
near future. Details of road transport policy are given in paras. 3.11-.13.
2.11      The current national transport plan is an integral part of the
1973-78 National Development Plan and provides an adequate basis for short-
term development programs. However, during the Plan period Government also
intends to undertake a comprehensive, long-term, national transport plan
which is not immediately needed and should be undertaken only after political
relationships in southern Africa are more settled and the development prospects
of various mineral resources are more certain.
2.12      The Ministry of Works and Communications (MWC) is responsible
for roads and air transport and has a section dealing with railways, but
since the latter is controlled from Rhodesia (para. 2.07), the Ministry has



- 4 -
little influence over it. Within the Ministry, a Planning Unit was estab-
lished in 1972 to prepare and continuously update the national transport
plan. This unit has only three professional people and is therefore limited
in its ability to undertake comprehensive long-term planning.
2.13      In 1974, Government introduced regulations concerning entry into
the road transport industry and vehicle licensing, weights, and dimensions
(para. 3.10). Permits from the MWC Transportation Secretary are necessary
for either handling one's owrn goods or providing for--hire service, but
applicants need only demonstrate financial responsibility and nominal demand.
Consequently, there are numerous truck-ers.  Bus operators are required to
charge one cent per passenger kilometer and there is substantial compliance
with this regulation. Because this fare level is not adequate to ensure
regular service on poorer roads, Government provides subsidies for services
on some of them. No control is exercised over freight rates, and there is
substantial competition among goods carriers. Previous road improvements
have led to substantial reductions in freight rates.
D. Previous Projects in the Transport Sector
2.14      The Bank Group has had two previous road projects in Botswana
and an infrastructure project with a road component. First, a US$3.6 million
credit was made available in 1964 (63-BEC) for:
(a) the design, construction, and reconstruction of three
roads totalling 570 km;
(b) selected betterment of the North-South road; and
(c) improvement and expansion of the maintenance organization.
The project was satisfactorily completed on time in 1968 within cost estimates;
however, according to an audit report, projected economic benefits were not
fully realized in the 6-year period following project completion. The second
road project was financed by an IDA credit (303-BT) of US$2 million, a Swedish
International Development Authority (SIDA) credit of US$4 million equivalent,
and a contribution by Government. This project consisted of:
(a)  the reconstruction and paving of the 84 km Pioneer Gate-
Lobatse-Gaborone-Sebele section of the North-South road;
(b)  consultant services for detailed engineering and construction
supervision; and
(c)  technical assistance to the Roads Branch of the Public
Works Department.



-5-
These works were also satisfactorily completed ahead of schedule and within
cost estimates. Finally, the Bank Shashe Infrastructure Project loan
(776-BT) included construction of the 52 km Serule-Selebi-Pikwe road, which
encountered some difficulties that have since been satisfactorily resolved.
Improvement of the road to bituminous standards will be completed in 1976.
3. THE ROADS
A. The Network
3.01      The trunk and main road network (Table 1) consists of about 5,000
km, some 150 km of which are bituminous-surfaced, 830 km all-weather gravel,
and the remainder dry-weather and earth. It comprises a trunk. or spinal
system fed by main roads. Both trunk and main roads are built to the same
standards. In addition, there is a rural network which a District Council
survey estimates at about 11,340 km, only 3,000 kmn of which have been inven-
toried. About 1%, or 30 km of inventoried district roads are all-weather
gravel; the rest are earth or sand.
3.02      At independence in 1966, Botswana had about 430 km of all-weather
roads which mainly served the more populated eastern corridor. Since then,
with Bank, SIDA, Canadian International Development Authority (CIDA), United
States Agency for International Development (USAID), Federal Republic of
Germany, and British Overseas Development Ministry (ODM) assistance, the
all-weather main road network has been expanded to about 1,000 km, and the
length of bituminous-surfaced roads has increased from 26 to about 150 km.
However, western and central Botswana have only dry-weather tracks and are
virtually isolated during the rainy season.
3.03      While the generally flat terrain is favorable to road construction,
major difficulties and consequent high costs result from lack of suitable
road construction materials, including water, in the widespread Kalahari
sand areas.
3.04      Recently-accelerated main road construction is described in
para. 3.11.
B. Traffic
3.05      During 1965-73, the registered vehicle fleet grew from 3,884 to
8,400 vehicles (Table 2), a 14% average annual growth rate. In 1973, the
fleet was composed of about 5,500 goods vehicles (mostly small trucks with
less than 3-ton capacity), 2,300 automobiles, 100 buses, and 500 other types
of vehicles. Most operators have only one vehicle and few have more than
five. Government estimates that foreign-owned motor carriers handle 20%
of total goods moved by road transport.



- 6 -
3.06      The Roads Department has conducted traffic counts on selected roads
during recent years. Some of these counts have not been taken carefully
enough to be reliable, and Government intends to transfer the responsibility
to the Central Statistical Office. During negotiations, Government assured
the Bank that its data collection system would be upgraded in order to provide
an adequate basis for further improving the road network (para. 6.01a).
C. Administration
3.07      The organization of the Roads Department is shown in Chart 1.  In
addition to the trunk and main road network, the Department is responsible
for maintaining airfields and Gaborone's city roads. The Department has four
major parts: Data and Planning, Development, Maintenance, and Rural Roads
(all headed by a chief roads engineer); the organization is basically
satisfactory. The Maintenance Branch is subdivided into the Northern,
Southern, and Western Maintenance regions, each headed by a road engineer.
All senior posts have been filled, with expatriate experts, under bilateral
assistance from ODM, SIDA, Norwegian Agency for Development (NORAD), and
Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA).
3.08      Until enough qualified Batswana are available, Government will
continue to depend on expatriates for professional staff. This dependence,
however, results in lack of continuity in senior and middle-level posts
because expatriates normally serve for only two years. There is also a
shortage of skilled local technical staff. Although Government is committed
to a localization program and ample funds for training abroad are available
from bilateral agencies, there is a lack of candidates with suitable educa-
tional backgrounds.
3.09      The District Councils, under the Ministry of Local Government and
Lands (MLGL), are responsible for the estimated 11,340 km of district roads
but have few or no facilities for road maintenance. The poor condition of
these roads continues to deteriorate. However, under an ongoing project, with
assistance from NORAD, about 900 km of the network are to be reconstructed or
improved.
3.10      The Road Traffic Act of 1974 is Botswana's first legislation
governing vehicle weights and dimensions and provides adequate legislation
to protect the road system. Axle loads are limited to 8 tons, as in RSA.
This legislation was timely, because increased mining activity is expected
to generate heavy vehicle loads. The proposed project will assist Government
in enforcing the regulations (para. 4.07).



-7-
D. Planning
3.11      Government's current road development plans include upgrading the
main road network, particularly the North-South road, improving rural roads,
and providing an all-weather access road to the north and to Botswana's
northern neighbors. Including the proposed project road, some 1,112 km of
trunk and main roads in the eastern corridor and in the north are to be
constructed or improved to all-weather gravel or bituminous standards at an
estimated cost of about US$50 million over the coming four-to-five years.
Although this may appear a costly and ambitious undertaking, there are
substantial indications that the necessary bilateral assistance is forthcoming.
Improvement of the North-South road section between Pioneer Gate-Lobatse-
Gaborone-Sebele was recently completed to bituminous standards (para. 2.14),
and that of the 180 km road between Sebele and Mahalapye is nearing completion
with ODM assistance. Detailed engineering for the 150 km Mahalapye-Serule
road is included in this project (para. 4.04b); a study is currently underway
to determine appropriate design standards. Detailed engineering is being
prepared for the 83 km Serule-Francistown road with assistance from the
Federal Republic of Germany. The 52 km Serule-Selebi-Pikwe road is to be
paved with Bank assistance (para. 2.14). Construction of the 190 km
Francistown-Nata road to bituminous standards has recently started with
assistance from DANIDA, CIDA, and NORAD. Construction to all-weather gravel
standards of a new 360 km road from Nata to the Zambian border at Kazungula
is to be completed in 1976 under USAID financing; Government is now considering
bituminizing this road. In addition, the 45 km Kanye-Lobatse road is
scheduled to be bituminized in the next two years with African Development
Bank Assistance.
3.12      The Division of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Finance and
Development Planning (MFDP) is responsible for overall planning and coordina-
tion of all sectors. To assist, planning units have been established in
other ministries concerned with development. The MWC planning unit prepares
detailed economic evaluations of proposed road development projects which,
if approved by the MFDP and National Assembly, are included in the ongoing
National Development Plan. Because of the growing workload and MFDP's
limited economic and planning expertise, responsibility for transport
planning will probably be increasingly assumed by the MWC planning unit.
3.13      A senior planning officer and two planning officers supported by
a statistics branch comprise the MWC planning unit. The staff is relatively
inexperienced but is supported by senior transport advisors and by the Roads
Department technical staff. The unit has successfully prepared road projects
for various financing agencies.



- 8 -
E.  Financing
3.14      Maintenance budget requests are prepared in the MWC, reviewed by the
MFDP Budget Administration Unit and Recurrent Budget Estimates Committee,
and then included in the General Budget for Cabinet and National Assembly
approval. Appropriations are made in full to the MWC at the beginning of
the fiscal year.  Transfers between item subheads are made with Budget
Administration Unit approval, and transfers between MWC departments are made
with the MFDP Permanent Secretary's approval. Balances may not be carried
over from year to year.
3.15      The Finance and Audit Act specifies that no development expenditure
may be incurred unless it is provided for in the National Development Plan.
In recent years, almost all capital expenditures for roads have been financed
through external grants and loans.
3.16      Road users contribute to Government revenue through taxes and
duties on vehicles, fuel, lubricants, and spare parts, and through license
and registration fees. All customs and sales duties on goods imported into
the common customs area (Swaziland, Botswana, Lesotho, RSA) are paid into
a common revenue pool. Only the license fees, which are not paid
into the pool, are set by the Botswana Government; this source yielded
R 339,000 in FY 1973/74 (US$500,025 at the then-prevailing exchange rate).
No specific data are available on total revenues collected, but Government
estimated that common pool revenues from road users amounted to about R 3.6
million in 1973/74 (US$5.3 million at the 1973/74 rate of exchange). This
estimated revenue substantially exceeded road administration and maintenance
expenditures in that year but fell considerably short of total road expendi-
tures including road construction (Table 3).
3.17      Annual road expenditures more than doubled from FY 1970-74 (Table 3)
and represented approximately 7% of total Government expenditure in the latter
year. Over this period, administration and maintenance expenditures were
modest because the road network was so small; however, the sizeable expansion
underway indicates that considerable additional expenditures will be required
in future. If current road development plans are implemented, by 1980 Botswana
will have about 1,100 km of bituminous-paved roads and about 900 km of gravel
roads, requiring an annual maintenance expenditure of about R 1.0 million; the
maintenance study included in the project (para. 4.04c) will examine in detail
the financing needed for future road maintenance.
F. Engineering
3.18      The Roads Department design capacity is basically limited to projects
whose size and complexity are similar to the proposed project road. Its
capacity is unlikely to increase significantly until the shortage of skilled
technicians, surveyors, and soils technicians is overcome. The proposed
project includes assistance aimed at strengthening the Department (para. 4.06).



-9-
G. Construction
3.19      Road construction is done by international contractors.  There are
no Botswana road contractors because of a lack of trained professionals,
sub-professionals, and managers and shortage of candidates provided by the
education system for such training. The infant contracting industry, which
is involved mostly in house construction, should be kept under observation
to determine when it is ready for development assistance.
3.20      Because of the Roads Department's limited capacity, expatriate
consulting firms supervise major road construction and will supervise construc-
tion of the proposed project road (para. 4.04a).
3.21      Major contracts are unit-price type; contract conditions conform
to international standards and contain acceptable provisions covering bid
bonds, performance guarantees, price escalation, advance payments, retention
money, arbitration, and first-year road maintenance by contractor.
H. Maintenance
3.22      The Roads Department carries out minimal main road maintenance
consisting mostly of grading and bush-dragging gravel or earth roads. This
is generally adequate for maintaining the largely unengineered roads at this
low standard. However, continuous grading and bush-dragging has caused many
roads to sink below the level of the adjoining land so that drainage is in-
effective and roads are impassable during rains. The rapid expansion and
upgrading of the main road network through the next few years (para. 3.11)
will increase maintenance demands, and Government is anxious to ensure that
the Department is able to meet them. Provision is made under the proposed
project for maintenance assistance (para. 4.04c). Government is also anxious
to strengthen the District Councils so they can adequately maintain and improve
rural roads (para. 3.09); the project includes assistance for this purpose
(para. 4.05). During negotiations Government gave assurances that its trunk
and main roads would continue to be adequately maintained and the district
roads of the Central District included in the pilot program of this project
would also be maintained adequately (para. 6.01b).
3.23      The Central Transport Organization (CTO) provides and maintains all
equipment and vehicles hired out to ministries and government agencies. How-
ever, inadequate workshops and equipment and a shortage of skilled workers,
combined with faulty equipment-management procedures, have resulted in a 30%
equipment availability rate and inefficient road maintenance operations.
A senior operations expert was provided to CTO by CIDA in February 1975 to
make a general assessment of the Organization's need for improvement. Two
additional senior equipment management and operations experts are expected



- 10 -
to be provided by CIDA to help review CTO structure and operations and make
recommendations for improvement. Technical assistance and training is also
likely to be forthcoming from CIDA after the review. During negotiations,
the Bank agreed with Government on the submission of a program and related
implementation schedule for improving CTO operations (para. 6.02a).
I. Training
3.24      Government's localization program is handicapped because the
education system is not producing enough candidates for engineering education.
Government is considering setting up a Faculty of Engineering on the Gaborone
campus of the University of Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland, but the basic
need at this time is to provide candidates for engineering education.
3.25      To overcome the shortage of skilled local staff, Botswana artisans
are being trained in the National Center for Vocational Training (set up
under an International Labor Office/United Nations Development Programme
project in Gaborone), and technicians are being trained in the Roads Depart-
ment's own facility. Such training is satisfactory but the demand for skilled
local staff exceeds the facility's capacity. Assistance will be provided
under the project to support the Department's efforts (para. 4.06).
4. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      The objectives of the proposed project are to assist Government
in developing the road network, in planning and organizing district and main
road maintenance, in strengthening the Roads Department, and in enforcing
vehicle weight and dimensions legislation.
B. Description
4.02      The project consists of:
(i)  construction of the Gaborone-Molepolole road (52 km) to
two-lane bituminous standards;
(ii)  consultant services to:
(a) supervise construction of (i);



- 11 -
(b) prepare detailed engineering for the Mahalapye-Serule
road section (about 150 kIn); and
(c) carry out a Road Maintenance Study;
(iii)  a District Road Maintenance Pilot Program comprising
technical assistance and equipment;
(iv)  provision of staff training and purchase of soils
and materials laboratory equipment; and
(v)  purchase of loadometers and weighbridges and installation
of the latter.
(i)  Gaborone-Molepolole Road Construction
4.03      This 52 km two-lane bituminous-surfaced road will link Molepolole,
the administrative and commercial center of Kweneng District, with the capital,
Gaborone, and connect with the recently-completed Molepolole-Letlhakeng
district road to form the District's road artery. It will replace an exist-
ing earth and gravel road which is difficult to traverse during the rainy
season, particularly on the Molepolole-Mogaditshane section which has poor
alignment and a relatively poor surface. The project road, to be built to
trunk road standards (Table 4), will pass through flat to rolling terrain,
except for a short hilly section near Molepolole. Construction of the project
road will significantly reduce user and road maintenance costs (para. 5.04).
(ii)  Consultant Services
4.04 (a)  Consultants will be provided to supervise the Gaborone-Molepolole
road construction and review the designs for this road in the
course of their work (para. 3.20). Further, they will assist
Government in bidding procedures and evaluation. To reduce con-
struction costs, they will also help Government locate water
sources for use in construction;
(b)  in addition, consultants will prepare detailed engineering
for the 150 km Mahalapye-Serule section of the high priority
North-South road. All other sections are either improved, under
construction, or planned for (para. 3.11). This earth road is
in very bad condition and is impassable during heavy rains.
A feasibility study completed in July 1975 shows that improvement
to bituminous-surfaced standards is economically justified;
(c)  finally, consultants will conduct a Road Maintenance Study.
This will assist Government in strengthening the Roads
Department and the District Councils by providing a 5-year
road maintenance program for the gazetted road network and a



- 12 -
road maintenance pilot program for the Central District, based
on economic priority ranking. Resources, equipment, trained
staff, materials, and funds needed for implementation of the
maintenance program will be identified and recommendations made
on meeting any shortfall.
(iii) District Council Road Maintenance Program
4.05      During the first phase of the Road Maintenance Study, consultants
will prepare a pilot program for the Central District. Organizational and
operational procedures will be set up for the betterment, rehabilitation,
and maintenance of these roads, and MLGL, through the Central District
Council, will implement them. At Government request, two road maintenance
units, mainly geared to labor-intensive methods (Table 5), and technical
assistance would be made available for the pilot program. The appropriate
blend of labor and equipment for the various operations will be identified
during the program and eventually applied to other districts.
(iv) Staff Training and Soils and Materials Laboratory Equipment
4.06      Roads Department staff will be trained in soils and materials
technology, road maintenance operations and techniques, and accounting and
cost control systems; soils and materials laboratory equipment will also
be purchased (Table 6). These measures should significantly increase the
Roads Department's capacity to carry out soils and road materials investigations
and site control testing and result in more efficient use of local materials
for road maintenance.
(v) Loadometers and Weighbridges
4.07      Loadometers and weighbridges will be purchased and installed to
assist Government in enforcing vehicle weight and dimensions legislation.
C.  Status of Engineering
4.08      Detailed engineering has been prepared by the Roads Department
to trunk road standards for the Gaborone-Molepolole road (Table 4) and appears
to br satisfactory.

D. Cost Estimate
4.09          Total project cost, ineluding contingencies, is estimated at
US$7.8 million, or US$7.4 million excluding taxes and duties. The foreign
exchange component is US$6.3 million, or 81% of total project cost. The tax
component is estimated at about 5% of total costs. Project cost estimates
are stumarized below:

4.10      The base costs reflect costs expected in August 1975,
and were derived as follows:
(a)  Road Construction:  base costs were calculated on the basis of
detailed engineering for the project road and recent bids for simi-
lar roads in the country. A physical contingency of 10% was
included as well as a price contingency of about 19% to cover
local and foreign cost increases to bid date, January 1976,
and through the construction period at the following estimated
rates: 16% for 1975, 14% for 1976, and 12% for 1977. Foreign
costs are estimated at 76% of total costs, of which approximately
7% represents taxes.
(b) Consultant Services: costs were estimated on the basis of
similar services provided in the past. The cost of supervision
provides for pre-construction consultant services to the Roads
Department, including a review of road design and assistance
in bidding procedures. Also included were a 10% physical
contingency and a price contingency of about 10% to cover
cost increases.
(c) Technical Assistance and Training: costs were based on
similar services already being provided in Botswana. A
physical contingency of 10% was included as well as a price
contingency of about 10%.
(d) Road Maintenance and Soils and Materials Laboratory Equipment:
estimates were obtained from equipment suppliers. A physical
contingency of 10% was included as well as price contingencies
estimated at about 8% to cover cost increases to time of delivery;
they reflect cost increases of 12% for 1975 and 10% for 1976.
Local costs include local handling and transport costs. A
provisional list of district road maintenance equipment has been
furnished by Government (Table 5); this will be reviewed by the
technical assistance experts to be provided to the MLGL and
agreed with the Bank.
(e)  Loadometers and Weighbridges:  costs were based on suppliers'
estimates, a 10% physical contingency and price contingencies
estimated at about 8% to cover cost increases to time of
delivery; they reflect price increase estimates of 12% for 1975
and 10% for 1976. The local costs cover local handling, transport,
and installation costs.



- 15 -
E. Financing
4.11      Total project cost is estimated at US$7.8 million (US$7.4 million
excluding taxes and duties). The foreign exchange component is US$6.3
million, about 81% of total project cost. The project will be financed by
a Bank loan of US$5.8 million, which will cover 78% of the total project cost
net of taxes and duties, and a US$2.0 million (US$1.6 million excluding
taxes and duties) Government contribution, as agreed during negotiations.
The Bank loan will cover about 70% of road construction costs (76% exclud-
ing taxes and duties, but including contingencies) and the foreign cost of
consultant services, technical assistance, and equipment; no local costs
will be financed by the loan.
F. Implementation
4.12      The Roads Department will be responsible for executing road con-
struction, securing consultant services and training, and for procuring soils
and materials laboratory equipment, weighbridges, and loadometers; after
installation of the weighbridges, weighbridges and loadometers will be
operated by the Traffic Police. The MLGL, through the Central District
Council, will be responsible for executing the District Road Maintenance
Pilot Program, recruiting technical assistance experts, and procuring road
maintenance equipment.
4.13      The road construction contract will be awarded and the road
maintenance equipment procured after international competitive bidding,
in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement. Soils and
materials laboratory equipment, weighbridges, and loadometers will be pro-
cured under standard Government procurement procedures, which are satisfactory
for these relatively minor items. Consultants and technical assistance ex-
perts for the Roads Department and the MLGL will be employed under terms of
reference and conditions agreed with the Bank (para. 6.02b). The specific
maintenance equipment needed for the District Road Maintenance Pilot Program
will be identified by the technical assistance experts and approved by
the Bank.
4.14      Main road construction has generally been equipment-intensive,
principally due to the difficulty of organizing a large labor force in a
country where the few population centers are widely separated; further,
labor, much in demand by RSA mining companies, is generally available only on
a seasonal basis. Finally, the logistic costs of providing essential services
for a large labor force in semi-desert areas with limited transport facilities
are high. However, the construction of culverts, drains, rip-rap paving,
and structural excavation will require a substantial labor input, and the
degree of labor intensiveness suitable for maintenance will be determined in
the course of the pilot maintenance program (para. 4.05).



- 16 -
4.15      The road construction contract is expected to be awarded in early
1976 and the work completed by mid-1977. The road runs through tribal land,
but Government has the right of eminent domain and no problems are expected in
acquiring land for the right-of-way. The soils and materials laboratory
equipment, weighbridges, and loadometers are expected to be purchased by
April 1976, and the contract for district road maintenance equipment should
be awarded by January 1977. Detailed engineering of the Mahalapye-Serule
road and the Road Maintenance Study should start in early 1976 and be completed
by early 1977. The District Road Maintenance Pilot Program is to be prepared
during the first phase of the Road Maintenance Study and implementation is
expected to start in mid-1977. During negotiations, the Bank agreed with
Government on the timing of project implementation (Charts 2 and 3) and
progress reporting procedures (Annex).
G. Disbursements
4.16      Loan disbursements will be made on the basis of about 70% of the cost
of civil works, for an estimated 80% of the total cost of consultant services,
technical assistance, and training, and 100% of the foreign costs of all
equipment. A disbursement schedule is shown in Table 7. Any surplus funds
in the loan account at project completion will be cancelled.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      The project road serves approximately 4,000 km  and about 60,000
people, mostly small farmers. Cattle-raising and crop cultivation are the
main sources of livelihood and the principal crops are sorghum, maize, millet,
and pulses. Gaborone and Molepolole are the major market centers for the
area's farm produce. Although there is some industrial development in
Gaborone, the city's economic role is largely that of a distribution center.
Molepolole, which has small cottage industries and an increasing number of
trading establishments, is a gateway to the Kalahari Desert and western parts
of Botswana.
5.02      Government plans to improve livestock raising practices and market-
ing facilities; such a facility is to be established in Letlhakeng in 1975.
A;so, the Kweneng Rural Development Association plans to expand its cottage
industries in Molepolole, and the District Council in 1974 approved a proposal
to build an industrial estate there. In 1974, mineral exploration in Kweneng
resulted in the discovery of substantial coal resources which are likely to
become an important factor in the local economy. Also, tourism is expected
to increase, principally in the Khutse Game Reserve about 160 km northwest
of Molepolole, and Government plans to develop tourist facilities there.
These developments would all be facilitated by improving the project road.



- 17 -
5.03      In 1973, traffic on the project road reached 330 vehicles per
day (vpd) on the Gaborone-Mogaditshane section and 201 vpd between Mogaditshane-
Molepolole. On the basis of past traffic growth, averaging over 15% annually
in recent years, and the above-described existing and planned development in
the area, Government estimates that traffic will grow by at least 10% annually
through 1997. In this evaluation, a more conservative forecast is used, namely,
9% annually to 1987, declining to 8% thereafter (Table 8).
5.04      The basis for the economic analysis of the project road is an
assessment of expected traffic benefits and costs with and without the proposed
improvements over 20 years, the estimated economic life of the road improvement.
The investment cost is taken as the net of tax cost of improving the road,
including supervision and physical contingency costs. The principal quanti-
fiable benefits are savings in vehicle operation and road maintenance costs
(Table 9). There are also other benefits which have not been quantified, such
as improved access to social and administrative facilities and some generated
traffic.
5.05      The streams of costs and benefits indicate that the proposed
investment in the Gaborone-Molepolole road is economically sound (Table 10).
It will yield a 17% economic return; the same return is calculated for
each of the two major road sections. The road has a first-year return above
10% when using a 10% discount rate.
5.06      Sensitivity tests applied to the economic analysis assumed con-
struction cost increases, traffic growth rate reductions, and decreased
vehicle operating cost savings. For example, if project road construction
costs increase by 25%, the economic return is reduced from 17% to 14%. If
traffic is assumed to grow at only 6% throughout the economic life of the
project, the economic return remains satisfactory at about 14%, while a 10%
decrease in savings in vehicle operating costs reduces the return to about
16%. In each case the economic return remains satisfactory. Construction
cost increases are considered the major risk.
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government
that:
(a) procedures for collecting traffic data will be improved
in order to facilitate future road planning (para.3.06);
(b) Government will continue to maintain the trunk and main roads
adequately and will adequately maintain the Central District
roads (para. 3.22); and
(c) the additional financing required to complete the project
will be made available (para.4.11).



- 18 -
6.02      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached with Government on:
(a) the submission of a program and implementation schedule to
improve the CTO (para.3.23);
(b) terms of reference for consultant services and technical
assistance experts (para.4.13); and
(c) project execution timing and progress reporting procedures
(para.4.15).
6.03      The proposed project is a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$5.8
million to the Republic of Botswana. An appropriate loan term would be 23
years with a grace period of three years.

Note:
These units costs have been used to calculate savings in vehicle operating
costs (VOC) which constitute the principal type of benefit expected from the
road improvement. For example, for 1977, the R 194,000 VOC savings on the
Mogaditshane-Molepolole section (Table 10) were derived as follows: first,
the 282 vpd for 1977 (Table 8) was analyzed by vehicle type. Second, unit
VOC savings by vehicle type were calculated using the data in Table 9 and
then adjusted to reflect the fact that the road surface is 75% earth and
25% poor gravel. Finally, 1977 VOC savings were calculated as follows:
