PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BOLIVIA
FIRST EDUCATION AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
(LOAN 1404-30)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the First Education
snd Vocational Training Project in Bolivia, for which a World Bonk loan of
US$15.0 million was extended to the Republic of Bolivia in May 1977. The
Loan became effective in October  1977.    The  estimated total cost of the
Project was US$21.39 million. Project implementation has ended and the sum
of US$4.4 million of the loan proceeds has been cancelled.
This report was prepared by a UNESCO mission for the Government of
Bolivia under the terms of the Cooperative Agreement concluded between
UNESCO and the  World  Bank.    At  the  invitation  of the Government, the
mission composed of Messrs. L. Secco (architect and mission coordinator)
sad Mr. Hugo Diaz (educational planner, consultant) visited Bolivia from
February 1 to 14, 1987.  The mission met with the appropriate authorities,
particularly  in  the  Project   Implementation  Units  of  PEIA  (Proyecto
Educativo Integrado del Altiplano) and FOMO (Servicio Nacional de Formaci6n
de Mano de Obra). The mission also visited Washington, D.C., and reviewed
all relevant project files at Baik Headquarters. This PCR is, therefore,
based on: (i) the discussions held snd data received by the mission in
Bolivial and (ii) file research conducted at Bank Headquarters and
discussions with Bank staff. A draft of the report has been reviewed by
the Bank's Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office snd their
comments incorporated in the final version of the report.
The  valuable  assistance  provided   by  the  Government  in  the
preparation of the report, particularly by the staff of the Project
Implementation Unit is gratefully acknowledged.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by  OED  staff.   The draft PCR was sent to
the Borrower and its agencies for comments in March 1988. No comments were
received.

PROJECT COMPLCTION REPORT
BOLIVIA
FIRST EDUCATION AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
(LOAN 1404-BO0
EVALUATION SU!^ARY
Introduction
1.       This project was identified and prepared by two UNESCO missions In
May 1975 and January 1976, respectively, following several unsuccessful
attempts at formulating a project in the late 1960s-early 1910. Appraisal
by a World Bank teem followed in August 1976 and Board approval, on
April 12, 1977. Because. of unprecedented economic difficulties and hyper-
inflation leading to a Irop in the rate of exchange from about $b 25 per
US$ dollar in February  1982  to  about  $b 1,900,000 in December 1985, the
project could not be implemented as planned and underwent a severe cut in
scope. In spite of four one-year extensions, about 302 of loan proceeds
remained undisbursed and were cancelled.
Proiect Obiectives and Content
2.       The project had a double purpose:    (i) to expand and strengthen
basic education, and (ii) to increase capacities in vocational training and
to diversify and improve programs.
3.       In the case of basic  education,  this was to be achieved through
the construction/furnishing/equipping of 955 basic classrooms, 10 new lower
secondary schools, a teacher training college and 287 staff houses serving
a total student population of almost 43,000. This physical investment was
to be complemented by curriculum and teaching materials development, train-
ing of about 1,300 staff, the elaboration of educational radio programs and
related technical assistance.
4.       The second objective was to be  supported oy the creation of four
regional training centers (civil workslfurniture/equipment), the expansion
of an existing center, and equipment for another, with a total incremental
training capacity of 1,200; two mobile training units with 15 sets of
equipment to serve 2,300 persons/years; and related technical assistance.
The Bank loan of US$15 million was to cover 70Z of the total estimated cost
of US$21.4 million, with the Government financing the remainder.

Imilementation Experience
5.       It took 9.5 years  lnstead  of  four  as estimated at appraisal to
complete the project.    De1jya  could  be  traced  to three major factoras
staff inexperience and, lter on, turnovor in the two PIUs (in the
Ministries of Education and Labor, respectively), administrative instabi-
lity (with 13 Ministers of Education, 16 Ministers of Labor and 18 P1U
Diroctors between 1977 and 196); end, overshadowing everything lsoe, a
grave economic crisis resulting In hyperinflation during the years 1982 to
1985 which left the Government In chronic shortage of budget funds. This
led to a drastic cutback in project activities, four one-year extensions of
the closing date, *nd a large unused portion (about 307) of loan funds
which was c-ncelled.
Results
6.       The basic education sub-project used  about 751 of total disbursed
loan proceeds, compared  to  en  appraisal  estimate  of  70S.   In primary
education, 985 (instead of the appraisal estimate of 955) cl"asroom were
served, but because of price Increases and budget restrictions the emphasis
was shifted from civil works to furniture/equipment, with only 531 of the
target for new classroom  construction  being  realized.    Nine of the ten
lower secondary schools were omitted from the project and the technical
assistance was cut by more than half (PCR, par&. 3.03).
7.       Similar reductions  were  made  in  the  vocational training sub-
projects the construction of one regional training center was cancelled,
the other three were neither completed nor furnished, the two centers to be
upgraded were excluded from the project and no institution was furnished.
By the same token, technical assistance was reduced by more than two-thirds
(PCR, para. 3.03).
8.       Becauso of the long  implementation  period and of temporary over-
staffing, project administration costs (net of technical assistance)
amounted to more than 22Z of total project cost, almost 501 higher than
appraised.
Education Outcomes
9.       Basic  Education.    Physical  targets  (number  of  school ploces
affected) were surpassed by 3S (although with a shift from construction to
equipping, see par&. 6 above).    In  1986, utilisation of those places was
disappointingly low (451). However, the investments in the teacher train-
ing college are expected to lead  to a more satisfactory supply of teachers
in the future  (PCR,  par.. 4.02).    Enrollment  shortfalls also meant an
uneconomical student/teachers ratio, which deteriorated from 19:1 at the
start of the project to 17tl at the end of project implementation, instead
of the expected improvement to 35:1 (PCR, para. 4.03).



- viii - 
10.      Some progreas  was made  in  terms  of  internal efficiency (with
averag- stud-nt promotion ret* in basic *ducation being above 882 in 1986)
nd quality of *ducation:    curricula were  updated,  textbook and other
teaching materials developed and provided, and related production capaci-
ties established (PCR, par&. 4.05).  However, the urban/rural dichotomy of
education which was seen as a major weakness of Bolivia's basic education
system, remains unchanged (PCR, par&. 4.04).
11.     Vocational Trainina.  Th. shortfall  in construction of new train-
ing places meant a reduction in training activities by more than one half
(a 1985 enrollment of lese than 3,500 instead of a 1981 target of 7,700).
The anticipated emphasis on providing training assistance to the mining
sector did not develop (PCR, para. 4.07).
12.      Similarly,  curricula development,  preparation  of instructional
materials and other measures of quality enhancement fell short of expecta-
tions, nor did the equipping provided under the project conform to the
original plans (PCR, pare.  4.08).    Finally,  the  deletion of the mobile
training units from the project meant a curtailing of the geographic cover-
age of vocational training (PCR, paras. 4.08-4.09).
Sustainability
13.      Basic Education.  Lack of  Government funds has affected the scope
of investments under the project.   While this shortfall in realization of
physical targets Is regrettable, it has had a fortuitous side effect in
that it has led to a lesser recurrent budget load than would otherwise have
been the case. The PCR does not contain any data which would put in doubt
Government's cr2acity to maintain and operate the facilities created under
this sub-project.
14.     Vocatlon&l Training.   The  PCR makes  reference to an inadequate
budget and infrastructure as an obstacle to improving the quality of
training (PCR, pare. 4.07).    However,  one important positive development
achieved during project implementation has been the earmarking of one
percent of the salary bill of enterprises for vocational training purposes
(PCR, pare. 4.11). In the longer run this should help to put vocational
training on a solid financlal footing.
Findings
15.      Project implementation  faced the  twofold  difficulty of dealing
with an operation which was both the first in the sector and of consider-
able complexity and second, of taking place during a period marked by great
economic and budgetary  difficulties.    Despite the necessary curtailments
and simplifications in scope and design, the project is still to be
considered a worthwhile undertaking  in the  light  of Bolivia's large and
persistent needs in human  resources  development.   Future projects could
continue to strengthen this basis, with due regard to the sector's finan-
cial, implementation and operational capabilities.

CHAPTER I
PROJECT BACKGROUND
Socio-Economic Setting
1.01     In 1976 Bolivia had one of the lowest levels of GNP per capita (US
$315) in Latin America and the Caribbean, higher only than Haiti. The
country vas one of the least developed in the Region, predominantly rural,
with strcng cultural and geographical barriers to domestic integration and
imbalances in the distribution of population and resources. About 70
percent of the population (5.6 million in 1975) lived in rural areas,
mainly in the Altiplano and the central valleys, and engaged in small scale
subsistence agriculture. Many of these neither spoke nor understood
Spanish. The indices of social progress were quite unfavorable: literacy
rate - 38 percent, infant mortality - 157 per thousand live births, and
average life expectancy - 44 years.
1.02     Agriculture accounted for about 25 percent of GDP and 53 percent
of employment. Manufacturing accounted for 10 percent of GDP and eight
percent of employment, with 80 percent of these workurs employed in
traditional handicraft and cottage industries. Several mineral deposits
were known to exist, but more efficient exploitation of these required
investment to upgrade mining operations. Substantial investment was also
needed for exploitation of forest and agricultural potential.
1.03     Both the small modern sector and the large traditional sector
suffered from low productivity attributed to the shortage of qualified
manpower. The appraisal mission estimated the need for skilled and semi-
skilled workers as 27,100 per year between 1975 and 1985. Some 72 percent
of the labor force had not completed primary education. Despite this, the
national development plan 1976/80 laid emphasis on the physical and natural
resource base at the expense of attending to mobilizing human resources.
The Education and Traingna Sector
1.04     At the time of appraisal, the main issues identified in the sector
weres
(a)      administration - the rura;urban dichotomy within the management
of the system and the need to decentralize the administration even
in the face of very limited trained manpower;
(b)      Dlanning - the relative recency and weakness of planning efforts
and the fact that the financial implications of the sector
developments included in the national 1976-80 development plan had
not been carefully studied;
(c)      curriculum - the need to move away from a strict academic
orientation and to place more mphasis on practical activities,
produce new materials, and make programs more relevant to the
socio-economic environment, particularly by introducing the
teaching of children in their mother tongue and using radio for
non-formal education.



-2-
(d)      access to education - (i) at primary and secondary levels the
distribution of places favored urban areas; (ii) there were many
overaged studentst (iii) retention rates were low; (iv) primary
school teachers were inefficiently used, so that, although Bolivia
was spending a larger share of its GNP on primary education than
almost all Latin American countries, its enrollment ratio was one
of the very lowest; (v) several primary schools were 'incomplete'
(that is lacking the higher grades) and there was need to
rationalize the situation and to undertake school location
planning; and
(e)      education finance - the already high unit costs and high total
expenditure on education presented a dilemna with regard to
expansion.
The Prolect
1.05     Discussion of the First Education Project in Bolivia was initiated
in 1966. Between that year and 1969, the Bank, through the Unesco/World
Bank Cooperative Program, sent study missions although no Project resulted
directly from these studies. The reconnaissance and identification
missions conducted between 1973 and 1975 facilitated the preparation of the
Project (January 1976) and its appraisal (May/August 1976). One hundred
and thirty-two man-weeks in the field were devoted to Project generation,
including 90 from 1973 onwards.
1.06     Obiectives. The Project consisted of two components which
corresponded to two priority areas of education development policy -
Component A: Primary and Community Education, and Component Bs Vocational
Training. Component A concerned the Altiplano region of the Department of
La Paz only. One geographical zone was selected in order to ensure the
viability and test the relative usefulness of the proposed measures, before
applying them on a more general scale. This component, which was
tantamount to a major educational reform, pursued the following objectivess
(a)      systematic increase of access to primary education, within the
recognized budgetary constraints of the country, through the
expansion and improvement of basic schools Grades 1-5 and lower
secondary schools Grades 6-8, a more efficient use of primary
facilities and rational school location planning, extensive use of
multi-Grade teaching, a reduction of the teacherspupil ratio from
1:19 to 1:35, improved average retention rates to 70 percent and
reduction of enrollment of the overaged children from 40 percent
to 20 percent by 1985, gradual increase in automatic promotion,
revision of the school calendar to take account of agricultural
cycles, and a reorganization of primary education by merging the
rural and urban sub-systems and restructuring administration and
school supervision;
(b)      development of new curricula, learning materials and teacher
training programs so as to place greater emphasis on practical
activities and experimentation in agriculture, health, home skills
and rural crafts and on the use of the vernacular - predominantly
Aymara - in the first three Grades of basic education;



-3-
(c)      establishment of a coumunity education program to inform and
motivate rural audiences to adopt new attitudes and practices in
agriculture, health, nutrition, and other selected areas, and a
campaign to encourage rural families to leave female children in
school for longer periods.
1.07     Component B, Vocation training, which amounted to approximately
301 of the total project cost, was aimed at: (a) assisting the Government
to expand the National Manpower Development Service (Servicio Nacional de
Formacion de Mano de Obra - FOMO) to meet national requirements for new
workers, and (b) raising productivity levels by upgrading the skills of
those employed. It included: (a) construction and equipment (i) to expand
staff training capacities and (ii) to generate gaining possibilities in
mining, and (b) the organization of mobile units to promote rural
development. This component also envisaged the provision of management
advice, and in-service training for small and medium-sized enterprises.
1.08     Content.  Specifically component A comprised:
(a)      the construction andlor furnishing and equipment of 955 basic
classrooms (approximately 152 of the total number existing), 10
lower secondary schools, the Teacher Training College of Warisata
and 287 staff houses to serve 37,818 basic and 4,588 lower
secondary pupils (approximately 8S and 11 of total, respectively),
as well as 426 teacher trainees (approximately 32 of total);
(b)      a new curriculum, teaching materials and training for 1,200 school
teachers and 100 training college teachers, school directors and
supervisors in the Project area;
(c)      supplementary educational radio programs to help Aymara children
to learn Spanish in the first three Grades of the basic cycle;
(d)      the development of community education and training through radio
programs supported by teaching materials and mobile units;
(e)      A pre-investment study of the educational and training needs of
low-income populations who migrate from the Altiplano to the city
of La Paz; and
(f)      technical assistance consisting of 8.5 man-years of expert
services and 54.5 man-years of fellowships for local staff.
1.09     Specifically component B comprised:
(a)      the construction, furnishing and equipment of four new regional
centers, in La Paz city, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz and Tarija, the
espansion of one existing center (La Paz - El Alto) and the
equipment of another (Oruro) to serve about 1,200 workers
annually;



-4 -
(b)      the provision of two mobile training workshops for further
training in mining operations and 15 sets of equipment and
transport for agricultural and rural handicrafts training to serve
2,300 persons per year;
(c)      a pre-investment study of socio-economic conditions in the
principal mining areas of the Altiplano in order to identify job
creation possibilities and related training needs and to recommend
action programa; and
(d)      technical assistance consisting of 9.5 man-years of expert
services and 8.5 man-years of fellowships.
1.10     Overall, by 1981, the expanded FOHM training system was expected
to produce about 7,700 managers, supervisors, skilled and semi-skilled
workers per year in 38 occupations related to construction, electrical,
mechanical, services, agricultural and mining fields. By that time, it was
felt, some 1,900 would have been new entrants to the labor force and the
rest (5,800) would have been upgraded employees. In addition, the in-plant
training scheme was expected to upgrade the skills of 9,000-10,000 workers
per year.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Overview
2.01     The Project implementation period spanned 9.5 years instead of
four years as originally estimated. Implementation was slow, mainly
because of management problems and severe Government financial constraints.
There was a delayed start of nearly all the Project activities (selection
of sites, preparation of architectural plans, construction, acquisition of
furniture, equipment and technical assistance).
Changes in Prolect Composition
2.02     Two major amendments to the Loan Agreement were made - in December
1981 and October 1983:

Proiect Management
2.03     Two units were established to implement the Project components,
one in MEC for component A and the other in FOMO for Component B. In
addition, the Cousunity Education by Radio Unit (ECORA) was created within
the Bolivian Radio School (ERBOL) with responsibility for non-formal
education work through the radio. The Project units in the MEC and FOMO
operated with staff vhose numbers rapidly exceeded those envisaged at
appraisal. The quality of Project management in the early years revealed
the experience of those concerned in handling this type of Project,
especially in organizing and implementing public works, tendering
operations and coordinating and managing work execution. There was
reasonable continuity of staff during the first 18 months of implementation
but it ceased after 1979. Between Loan signature in May 1977 and December
1986 there were 13 Ministers of Education, 16 Ministers of Labor, eight
Directors of the MEC Project Unit and 10 Executive Directors in FOMO. To
this must be added the problems of Government financing and low salaries.
In 1983, the ECORA unit (community education by radio) and the technical
support teams in the MEC Project Unit were dissolved, leaving the work and
responsibility in the hands of the respective directorates. The FOMO
Project Unit was disbanded at the beginning of 1985.
2.04     Implementation of Component A did not begin as it should have with
an information campaign amongst the rural populations to make them aware of
the Project aims. Consequently the Project ran into difficulties in the
middle of 1979. Reorganization of the Project Unit was undertaken by a
commission which included representatives of the Rural Teachers Federation
and the Farmer's Union. Of the 70 persons who were employed at that time
in the Unit, both centrally and in regional offices, the duties of 16 were
terminated and 23 were transferred to other services. As regards Component
B in FOMO, the administration was conducted on very centralized lines, and
participation by regional bodies was very limited'
2.05     Efficiency in planning, operation, rationalization and technical
support was not achieved. In certain instances, decision-making and
implementation were in the hands of persons who lacked sufficient knowledge
and experience of the realities of life in the regions' concerned.
Professional Services Desigms and Award of Construction Contracts
PART As
Basic Schools
2.06     Architectural designs are simple and proper and were prepared by
professionals contracted by the Project Unit (PEll); construction contracts
were awarded in three phases:
(a)      a first phase (about 45 percent of total cost) started as planned,
using SNDC as contractor;
(b)      a second phase (about 25 percent of total cost) was awarded to
ACFPMA; and
(c)      the remaining 30 percent was implemented directly by PEIA.



- 8 -
Because of managerial and financial difficulties experienced by the
contractors there were time overruns of about 100 percent.
2.07     The strategies of providing the buildings that was adopted for the
Altiplano regions did not take full advantage of the work-sharing
traditions of the Aymara people. However, communities participated
actively, mainly during the last period of implementation, and the
contribution of this source was about equivalent to 45 percent of total
construction cost (about US$ 1.6 million) (Annex 1). This participation
made it possible to offset the high cost of materials (in excess of
appraisal estimates), thus obtaining unit construction costs comparable to
those estimated at appraisal (about US$ 121/m2) (Annex 2).
Intermediate School and Teacher Training College of Warisata
2.08     The architectural designs for the Intermediate School and the
Warisata College were prepared by professionals contracted by PEIA and are
generally good. Unit areas for boarders are, however, too generous
(11.62/place instead of 6m2/place assumed at appraisal - a 93 percent
increase).
2.09     Construction was carried out by a private firm, which encountered
difficulties stemming from the country economic problems.
2.10     Starting in December 1981, when the Bank had already disbursed 50
percent of the Loan amount (Annex 3), the value of local currency fell
drastically, and since some basic materials (cement, steel) had to be
acquired with foreign exchange, construction costs increased rapidly in
local currency terms. Inadequate managerial control exacerbated the
problem and, as a result, the implementation of this Project item suffered
a 400 percent time overrun (Annex 3) and unit costs rose to double the
appraisal estimates (USS 344/m2 instead of US$ 153/m2) (Annex 2).
Printing Facilities
2.11     In order to accommodate the printing, storage and distribution of
textbooks and teaching materials, a building (not included in the Project
design) was designed and constructed (with an approximate area of 510 m2 at
a cost of US$ 169-,900) and this was approved for reimbursement out of Loan
proceeds (Annex 4). Architectural briefing and preliminary designs were
prepared by a private firm and completed by personnel of the implementation
unit (PEIA). Construction work was contracted to a private firm. The
building provides inadequate space and this limits the rate at which books
can be produced.
PART B:
Vocational Centers
2.12     Three of the new Project centers (Santa Cruz, Tarija, and La Paz-
City)2/  were designed by private firms and the designs were delivered well
behind schedule because of technical difficulties and problems of capacity
of the contracted architectural firms. Nevertheless, the plans appear to
be acceptable.
2/ The La Paz-El Alto Center was deleted.



2.13     Construction was contracted to local firms established in La Paz.
No records were available in FOM0  to show the amounts disbursed by
building; nevertheless, the following data were available:
(a)      original contract amount for the building was US $958,000;
(b)      estimated average progress on buildings, determined during the
missions's stay in Bolivia: 35 percent;
(c)      total disbursed amount from the Loan proceeds was US $499,600.
As can be seen, expressed in financial terms, construction progress
represents about 35 percent of the original contract amount and the amount
paid represents about 67 percent of the Loan Proceeds applied to this item.
This difference of US $163,900 between the progress of work and actual
amount paid reflects a practice of accelerating payments to meet spiralling
costs during the construction implementation period. This incurs the risk
of exhausting the budget before completion of the contract. The main
figures available are shown below:

Civil Works and Maintenace
PART A:
Basic Schools
2.14     Some 985 primary classrooms were built, repaired and/or
furnishedlequipped as compared to the 955 estimated at appraisal (+3
percent) (see Annexes 5 and 6). However, because of high construction
costs, provision of facilities consisted mainly of furniture given to
schools located in the same Project zones, instead of the construction of
new classrooms. Additions or replacements were reduced to almost one half
of the number estimated at appraisal as can be shown below:

Thus, while the total number of places achieved was about the intended
amount, the program of civil works and expansion actually implemented
represented a substantial reduction in Project scope.
2.15     Some variations are noted in the geographical distribution
estimated at appraisal. The number of classrooms included in Omasuyos I
Zone (next to Lake Titicaca)-increased about 43 percent, while the number
was reduced in other zones, particularly in Viacha (-45 percent) (Annex 5).
These changes reflect the changes in Government policy.
2.16     The quality of construction is acceptable.  Natural lighting and
ventilation are correct. The materials used were: concrete floors,
plastered walls, galvanized corrugated sheets (roofing), metal windows and
wooden doors.
PART A:
Intermediate Schools
2.17     Only one of the ten intermediate schools originally included in
the Project was built; this school is part of the Warisata Teacher Training
Complex and was located there for pedagogical training purposes. Another
intermediate school was provided only with instructional equipment
(Copacabana, Nanco Kapore). Consequently, the number of student places
eventually covered by the implemented Project was only about one fifth of
the appraisal estimates (546 instead of 2,824) (Annex 6).
Warisata Teacher Training College
2.18     The extension of the Warisata TTC was generally in accordance with
appraisal estimates, providing the number of student places foreseen (Annex
6). Areas estimated for administration and garages were omitted in
architect's briefs; instead, facilities of the existing main building were
S/ Thirty-six places per classroom plus 10 percent operating on a double
shift basis.



- 11 -
used for those purposes. One basic and one intermediate school were added
to the educational complex, increasing the areas built by 25 percent above
original estimates (Annex 7).
2.19     The quality of construction is acceptable but the lack of
maintenance means there is a risk of rapid deterioration of the buildings
and installations.
2.20     Some physical facilities are being used without natural light or
adequate ventilation, while the equipped main kitchen and dining areas are
not in use.
PART Bs
Vocational Centers
2.21     ZEtimated and contracted civil works for the three centers which
remained in the Project were not completed because of managerial and
financial difficulties within FOMO. After eight years of implementation
only 35 percent of the construction program had been completed. Only about
50 percent of the work on the La Paz Administrative Center was completed.
In addition to Government financing, financial assistance is being sought
for completion of the facilities.
2.22     The work for the Santa Cruz Center advanced only 25 percent,
lacking floors, walls, windows, doors, roofs, and finishings. The
institution is now operating in rustic existing buildings, but its
authorities appear to be well disposed to continue in the near future the
task of completing the already initiated civil works.
2.23     About 30 percent of the work on the Tarija Center has been done.
The institution meanwhile is operating in a part of the city totally
unsuited for teaching activities and in buildings provided for other
institutions and purposes.
2.22     1O00 agreed with the Bank to buy buildings from a religious
institution in Cochabamba, which consisted of six classrooms ith 80
student places each and *ight workshops and laboratories with a capacity
for 15 student places in order to bring a Center into operation. The cost
of this was met entirely by the Government. The Completion Mission
considered this acquisition a good one and the Center is now well
installed, although some lack of equipment was noted.
Furniture and ZouioAnt
PART A:
2.25     Preparation of lists and procurement of furniture and equipment
were delayed. By December 1981, when, according to the implementation
schedule, the disbursements should have been completed, only six percent of
disbursements had been made. About 36,000 units (individual chairs and
tables to serve two persons) were acquired (as compared to the 58,200 units
estimated at appraisal) at a unit cost about 43 percent higher than
foreseen, as can be seen in the table below:

2.26     About 90 percent of the furniture was delivered (the remaining 10
percent had been paid for and, at the time of the Completion Mission, its
delivery was expected soon). An average of 24 chairs and 12 tables per
classroom was supplied. The remaining furniture needs were met by using
existing chairs and tables (Annex 6).
2.27     About 93 percent of the equipment was delivered to the
institutions by the time of the Completion Mission. The remainder was
stored at Customs. The mission noted that the equipment is generally not
used; it is often stored in schools and in some cases it lacks essential
parts.
PART B:
Vocational Centers
2.28     For reasons that are not clear, furniture for the vocational
centers was not acquired, despite the fact that the lists were prepared for
bidding.   Project provision for mobile units was cancelled, but some
mobile units were financed from other sources.
2.29     Due to inadequate management, equipment was delivered to the
Centers before the civil works were completed, and this led to some
deterioration and damage. Insurance was not claimed in tim. The
following table shows the distribution of equipment estimated at appraisal
in relation to the actual distribution:

Technical Assistance
2.30     Comnonent A. A cooperation agreement between the Government and
the Organization of American States (OAS) was signed in September, 1977 for
the implementation of the technical assistance element of Component A.
Three factors intervened to cause NEC to postpone implementation of the
program. First, funds were not advanced to the OAS to cover initial costs.
Secondly, it was difficult to place candidates who were put forward but who
did not fulfill the admission requirements in foreign training centers.
Thirdly, MEC was not fully in agreement with the technical assistance
program proposed by OAS.
2.31     The revision of tha technical assistance program in October 1983,
especially done to overcome the difficulties in the implementation of
fellowships, was satisfactory. The TA progrm originally included in the
Project comprised 102 man-months of expert services and 654 man-months of
fellowships. The revised program covered 123 man-months of expert services
and 1,059 man-months of fellowships. All of the expert services were used
(124 man-months compared with the revised total of 123 man-months). The
services of a USA firm were used for the supply of experts on a contract
basis. Less time of experts was utilized in teacher training and in the
training and evaluation of non-formal education (six man-months instead of
12) whereas more time was required for bilingualism (22 man-months instead
of the planned 12 man-months. (Annexes 8 and 9). The revised fellowships
target was surpassed (1,780 man-months compared with 1,059 man-months) at a
cost 72 percent below the original estimate. The fellowships for ECORA
were not taken up. A large part of the fellowships training was carried
out in the country, only 210 man-months being used abroad (in Chile,
Brazil, Peru, Guatemala, Mexico, USA). National courses were organized in



- 14 -
the Tarija Higher Institute for Rural Education (ISER). They were mainly
devoted to management and supervision (497 man-months), bilingualism (210
man-months), planning (203 man-months), educational and Projects evaluation
(182 man-months) and curriculum (40 man-months).
2.32     Component B.  There were various reasons for the underutilization
of the TA provision for Component B. First of all, much time was lost in
fruitless negotiations with ILOICINTERFOR who were approached to administer
the TA program. Negotiations broke down on much points as the rate of the
overhead charge and the administrative services to be furnished.
Eventually FOMO met its administrative needs by direct hiring of a
consultant undec the Project.
2.33     Secondly, although FOMO was able to secure TA agreements with
several countries (Spain, France, the Fe&ez' Republic of Germany, the
Netherlands, Peru, Colombia, and Brazil;, btxause of the financial
difficulties of FOMO, many of these agreetmnt-. could not be carried out.
By the end of 1981, only 30 percent of tLk' >llowships had been awarded.
2.34     In October 1983, within the framework of the revision of the Loan
Agreement, expert services were reduced from 114 man-months to 64 and
fellowships from 101 man-months to 37.
2.35     The program as eventually carried out provided short-term
consultancies in procurement, vocational training and managing and
organizing regional centers.
Educational Aspects
PART A:
Primary and Community Education
2.36     In 1977, even before Loan Signature, a decree (and related
regu.ations) authorized automatic promotion and the integration of urban
and rural educational services through the unification of these services in
thf Project zones, thus creating a single system of administration and
su,ervision. An experimental strategy was worked out in 50 schools
covering curriculum development, differentiated school calendars, training,
nuclearization, bilingual and community education for the Grades 1-3 of the
basic cycle. The results of this experiment were limited, partly because
of inadequate coordination between the Project Unit and the responsible
management departments in the MEC, and partly because of the inappropriate
criteria for the selection of the experimental schools, which made
pedagogical assistance and supervision difficult. The educational map
which was being prepared was not used for the selection of the schools.
The nuclearization effort provoked a series of confrontations between
communities competing for the site of the central school.
2.37     The curriculum represented an effort at renewal and modernization
of programs. However, it suffered from certain limitations - its rather
unpragmatic scope, its poor adaptation to the circumstances of children in
the Altiplano, the absence of a sufficiently strong bilingual approach and
insufficient attention to the multi-Grade character of most of the schools.



- 15 -
Textbooks based upon the curriculum reveal the same defects.   Subsequent
attempts to revise the curriculum encountered problems of personnel change
and the almost complete lack of participation by teachers and MEC experts.
Nevertheless, some progress was made in the formulation of curricula up to
Grade S.
2.38     The production of material for pupils and teachers embraces Grades
1 to 5 in the areas of language, mathematics, social studies, natural
science, bilingualism, and pre-school education. The first manuals (in
1978) proved to be unsatisfactory in that the material could be used only
for one year and was produced at three times the cost originally envisaged.
These problems were corrected in subsequent editions and 326,330 copies of
manuals, worknotes and guides for the teacher were distributed as well as
174,420 copies of technical guidance papers for primary teachers and
teacher training college professors and 2,080 copies of papers on bilingual
education (Az_nex 10). Changes in educational policy regarding the
development of bilingual education caused the printing of material to be
suspended from 1982 onwards, in order to revise the materials so that it
could fit into the format of teaching in Spanish. Because of financial
difficulties, no further manuals have since been printed.  In October 1983,
the MEC decided to acquire a printing press for the production of
educational material. The building for the printing operations was added
to the Project and the press and other equipment were acquired with funds
from an administrative reform Project financed by USAID.
2.39     Radio programs to support the teaching of the language were a
central feature of the reform effort. The collaboration of Radio San
Gabriel, a private organization with considerable experience in the
dissemination of Aymara, was secured. It was envisaged that the Project
would supply a sufficient number of radio receiving sets to each basic
school. These sets were not supplied. The bilingual approach to be used
was called into question by the new authorities in the NEC who proposed the
teaching of Spanish by the direct method. There was also confusion amongst
parents and teachers as to the objectives of the approach.
2.40     The Teacher Training College of Warisata was planned as the
experimental center for teacher training. Under the Project it was to be
provided with new material and equipment. Special training programs were
organized in the Training College in support of the experimental Grades 1-3
curriculum and a new program was designed for the training of teachers.
Delays in the execution of public works and in the delivery of equipment
for the Training College led to the new curriculum being applied under
unsatisfactory conditions and with resistance from the teachers. The
natural and social sciences were studied without any contact with
laboratories or the surrounding milieu. The civil works and equipping were
completed only in the final years of Project implementation, but by that
time, good use of these was hindered by the shortage of funds.
2.41     This College has been in operation since 1982 and is one of four
which train teachers for work at the upper secondary level. It has an
enrollment of 300 students, with living accommodation for students and
staff houses. There is no official program of studies for this level and
the one in use is not coordinated with the program followed in the other
three training colleges. Some manuals do not correspond to the upper



- 16 -
secondary level, are out of date and in insufficient supply, some
professors are not qualified to train upper secondary teachers, and there
are shortcomings in the operation of the student living quarters.
Furthermore, operating conditions have been made more difficult by the
shortage of funds arising from the financial crisis.
2.42     Under the Project, schools which had not been inspected for
several years were to be given technical and administrative assistance.
All schools were visited by experts from the Project Unit during the first
years of implementation. Afterwards this was no longer possible because of
shortage of funds. Participation by district supervisors was poor and
advantage was not taken of these visits to obtain feedback for the
curriculum activities and teacher training.
2.43     ERBOL was contracted to develop a community education program for
out-of-school adults. This program was to be conducted on an experimental
basis for four years and then extended to other regions. ERBOL organized a
team which, with the assistance of the technical assistance experts
supplied by the Project, organized the first programs to gain the approval
of the rural population. Satisfactory progress was made, but coordination
with the services-of the MEC was secured only on a temporary basis while
technical assistance for non-formal education was being provided. There
were also delays in disbursements. At the end of 1979 ECORA had not yet
received the transfer of funds in respect of 1978. In 1987 the Project
still owed US$ 57,331.63 to ERBOL, equivalent to 15 percent of the contract
figure.  Because of, inter-alia lack of coordination and repeated changes
of personnel in the MEC and the Project Unit, this contract was terminated
in 1980 and a community education team was established in the Project Unit.
The scheduled program of activities of this team, however, exceeded the
technical capacity of the unit and made no use of previous experience.
2.44     A pre-investment study of the characteristics and educational
needs of the population migrating from the Altiplano to La Paz was included
in the Project. It was intended to identify educational and training
programs for illiterate and unemployed families. This study was deleted
from the Project when it was learned that the Urban Education Division of
MEC was going to carry out a similar study; however, this MEC study never
materialized.
PART B:
Vocational Training
2.45     For vocational training, FOMO was supposed to bring four new
centers into operation, expand one center and equip another already in
existence. These objectives were not fully achieved, thus frustrating both
the achievement of training targets and the functioning of centers as
regional centers. The number of trainees in FOMO programs increased from
2,079 in 1977 to only 3,444 in 1985 (Annex 11), well below the ambitious
targets stated in the appraisal report (para. 1.18 above). Most of the
courses given in the nine regional centers are of three-months' duration.
As e rule, the instructors are employed on a contract basis for the
duration of the course, with the result that there are frequent changes of
personnel and academic experience is not systemAtically accumulated.



- 17 -
Furthermore, the instructors lack adequate academic training for
transmitting knowledge. Attempts to plan training in line vith the needs
of the enterprise are still at a very early stage.
2.46     In order to increase training capacity in the mining sector and
for rural areas, it was planned to acquire mobile units to deliver courses
and consultancy services. A study of the concept of these units and their
equipment was made with the technical assistance experts provided under the
Project; however, although the list of equipment was approved by the Bank,
the plan was not implemented and this category of expenditure was suspended
in October 1983. A series of Videotape programs produced with the
assistance of the Swiss Government is being used by four mobile units
operating on a limited scale in the field of agriculture and stockraising
in the Santa Cruz Department. This material is supplemented by special
information sheets for farmers.
2.47     Using the resources available, FOMO organized courses for the
mining sector in Oruro and Potosl in which other agencies interested in the
development of the sector took part. The Mining Corporation of Bolivia
(COMIBOL) participated initially on a limited scale. An important task in
support of mining was the occupational analysis study and the preparation
and publication of modular programs for ten specialties. This was
completed with the technical assistance experts provide under the Project.
Training was provided for the Bolivian expert responsible for coordinating
the program, and for the instructors.
2.48     FOMO has organized a national courses certification system which
operates in three sectors - agriculture and stockraising, industry, and
services.  Because of the complexity  of the task, an agreement was signed
with Spain to improve the system, under which the services of an expert
were provided for six months in 1985.
2.49     In compliance with the Loan and Project Agreements, several
consultancy services for enterprises have been created in FOMO. They
include the followings
(a)      Enterprise training unit.  This was established in 1978 under an
agreement with National Apprenticeship Service for Industry, Peru
(SENATI) who trained the staff. Extra-institutional reasons
caused it to cease operations in 1980 but it resumed in 1983.
More extensive collaboration by SENATI and the National
Apprenticeship Service for Industry, Brazil (SENAI) for the
further training of the staff has been agreed.
(b)      Vocational guidance and employment service.  A vocational guidance
system has been created for the selection of courses according to
the interests and needs of participants. The service has not been
fully implemented and the assistance of the Instituto Nacional del
Empleo (Spain) is being sought.
(c)      Manatement Training and Consultancy Unit.  The Management
Development Unit was created in 1979 but became operational only
in 1983 with Spanish cooperation. The courses were started after
needs and priorities had been previously determined through a



- 18 -
sample survey amongst 40 heads of enterprises. This unit is now
established in the Handos Medios Department and is operating at
the level of small and medium-size enterprises, its aim being to
provide training for managerial and technical staff in the
production, personnel, economic and financial, and commercial
fields. Some 1.235 persons received training between 1983 and
1985.
2.50     Finally, the Loan Agreement included reference to a pre-investment
survey of socio-economic conditions in the mining centers and their
physical environment. Execution of the survey was authorized in September
1977 and it was entrusted to an Executive Directorate attached to the
Director of FOMO. At the urban level it covered eight centers, which form
the Seventh National Agglomeration, and, at the rural level, the provinces
of Bustillos and Chayanta to the North of Potosi. The survey areas were:
wages and family budget, job situation, urban-spatial structure, rural
environment, sectorial and other topics (transport, fairs, markets,
subsidiary groups, institutional and management survey). Delays were
encountered in connection with the processing of data and in the provision
of Government financing. Publication of the survey report was entrusted at
the end of 1980 to the Social and Labor Research Institute which completed
it in mid-1981. The report provides extensive analysis and focuses on the
socio-economic context of mining areas. These findings have been useful in
the development of policy regarding economic prospects for the mining
areas. However, the report does not adequately cover employment
opportunities, training requirements and the forms of action and programs
required. Additional analytic work on these topics has been initiated by
the current Government in the context of its program for restructuring and
adjustment, particularly with the closing of numerous state mines.

3.02     The main reasons for the lower Project cost relate to lack of
adequate Government financing, some weakness of Project administration and
in general, the unprecedented economic decline faced by the country since
1979 - inflation up to a monthly rate of 60 percent, and per capita GDP
reduction of 32 percent in five years - which resulted in drastic
reductions in the scope of the Project.
3.03     In Part A, only one intermediate school out of 10 originally
planned was built, only 53 percent of the target of new classrooms was
achieved for basic schools, technical assistance cost only 40 percent of
the estimate and pre-investment study was cancelled. In Part B, only 20
percent of the estimated cost for civil works of vocational centers was
incurred and the three centers remaining in the Project were not completed,
two other centers originally included in the Project were deleted
(Cochabamba and La Paz-El Alto), none of the institutions was furnished and
the cost of technical assistance was reduced by 70 percent. The only
component increased was the amount spent for Project administration of
Part A (57 percent) which was due to the longer than expected Project
implementation period (113 months instead of 49) and the high number of
PEIA staff at the beginning of Project implementation.
3.04     Unit construction costs were comparable to those estimated at
appraisal for basic schools (Annex 2), but more than double in the case of
the Warisata Teacher Training College (+125 percent), partly because of the
difference between the official and parallel exchange rates ($b/USS).
3.05     The funds disbursed for civi-l works of Part A of the Project were
distributed in a proportion different from that foreseen in appraisal
estimates as can be seen in the following table - substantial increase for
the Teacher Training College and substantial decrease for the basic
schools:

EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES
PART A:
Primary and CoimnunitZ Education
4.01     The Project was designed to address the following problems:  (i)
difficulties of access to and retention in the school system as vell as the
high percentage of-overaged children in school; (ii) the urban-rural
dichotomy in educational organization and administration; (iii) the
unsuitability of curriculum content, teaching materials, teaching methods,
school calendars, teacher training and further training programs and
language of instruction - children from Aymara villages being obliged to
study in a language other than their native one; and (iv) the limited
opportunities for adult education and training.
4.02     In basic education the target of places in project schools was
exceeded by three percent, thus providing a capacity to serve 39.000
children from the rural areas of the Altiplano. However enrollment data in
1986 indicate that only 45 percent of this capacity has been used. Thanks
to the new accommodation in the Training College of Warisata, it is
possible to achieve the planned enrollment of teacher trainees. Only one
of the planned ten lower secondary schools has been built and another one
equipped (Annex 6).
4.03     Efficiency.  Despite efforts to fill gaps in information, there is
little to show what improvements in efficiency and achievement have been
obtained, although we can assume that the economic crisis would have had a
negative impact on retention in school to the extent that poverty is a
factor in this. For the entire system the teacher:student ratio, which it
was hoped would be 1:35 at the end of project implementation by comparison
with 1:19 at the start, had, in fact, become 1:17. For the academic year
1986, average student promotion in the basic cycle was 88.2 percent of all
students, while repeaters and dropouts in that year amounted to 11.8
percent.
4.04     Urban-Rural Dichotomy.  The urban-rural dichotomy represents
discrimination, waste of resources, and excessive bureaucracy. Resolution
of the problem requires the cooperation of teachers' unions and the public.
Under the project there was no effort made to secure that support and
nothing was achieved in urban-rural integration.
4.05     Teaching Materials.  An effort has been made to develop and update
various kinds of teaching materials as well as the in-service training of
teaching personnel. The updating of curricula, the printing of manuals and
other material, and the training of teachers are achievements which have
made it possible to make up for the shortage of resources and which have a
direct influence on the quality of the services provided. There now exists
an installed capacity and equipment which can be adapted for printing
material and for pre-service and in-service training of teachers. There
are also fellowship recipients who received further training abroad and who
occupy administrative and technical posts in the MEC. The trainers of



- 24 - 
those trained in the country, however, complain that, upon compl;tion of
their training, the fellowship recipients are assigned to functions for
which they have not been trained.
4.06     Adult Education.  A complete articulation of formal and non-formal
educational activities was not achieved. The necessary dissemination of
ideas about the role of non-formal education and its present and future
importance, not only amongst the officials and experts of the MEC but also
amongst teachers and the public, was not undertaken.
PART B:
Vocational Trainlng
4.07     The planned regional centers were intended to cater for a total of
7,700 managers, supervisors and skilled and semi-skilled workers by 1981.
Failure to fulfill construction targets limited FOMO enrollment to 3,444 in
1985 or 45 percent of target. Of this total, 41 percent were trained for
industry, 31 percent for agriculture and stockraising and 28 percent for
the services. The priority accorded by the project design to the mining
sector was apparently not reflected in project implementation.
4.08     There was still only slow progress in improving the academic
quality of training. This slowness was partly due to the lack of an
adequate budget and infrastructure. At present each center prepares its
own training programs and instructional materials. The pre-investment
survey of mining centers (para. 2.50, and their environment did not lead to
an improvement in the curricula. There is a lack of courses in teaching
methodology for FOMO contract instructors. The Project has helped to
improve the equipment of the FOMO centers but this has not been done in
accordance with project plans, nor was it based on a study of needs and
priorities, and, in some cases, the equipment available for certain areas
of training is either incomplete or outmoded.
4.09     The deletion of the mobile units from the project has limited
FOMO's ability to serve outside the cities where the regional centers are
based. The assistance which the Swiss and Brazilian Governments reported
to have given in organizing the four mobile units represented only a very
limited coverage in Santa Cruz.
4.10     The Project provided for the institutional strengthening of FOMO
as a basis for a technical assistance program comprising consultancy
services and grants. The benefits derived from this activity have been
limited because of the repeated changes of personnel in the institution.
Instruments for analyzing manpower characteristics, training requirements
and training costs at the regional center level by specialty were not
sufficiently developed, and after an initial call for bids were completely
abandoned. Consequently, the data base for sound decisions in these areas
has not been laid.



- 25 -
4.11     One of tha prerequisitea for the operation of Component I was to
guarantee for FOHO the proceeds from one percent of the salaries bill paid
by public and private enterprises. The Project contribution in this field
has been one of its most important achievemnts. The number of
contributors to, and level of compliance with, this tax has been increasing
as a result of the recently adopted Tax Reform Law (1986).

cHAPm V
BANK PERFORMANCE
Project Generation
5.01     The generation of the Project absorbed a considerable effort in
excess of the Bank's normal practice. Some 132 man-weeks of work in the
country were r-quired to generate the Project (42 man-weeks between 1966
and 1969, and 90 between 1973 and 1977), which is very high compared with
other Projects in the region.  Nevertheless, some weaknesses are
discernible in Bank performance during this phase.
5.02     The appraisal missin forecast an annual growth rate of GDP of at
least 5.2 - 5.5 percent (1975-85) - with possibilities of 5.9 percent
(1975-80), and 6.6 percent (1980-85) if substantial foreign investment
could be realized and hydrocarbon exploration were successful. In fact,
between 1973 and 1983 the real growth rate was 1.5 percent along with a
population growth rate of 2.6 percent and between 1980 and 1985 GDP
declined by 11 percent.
5.03     The appraisal mission was also aware that education accounted for
a relatively large share of GDP - 5.3-5.5 percent (1970-76) - and a
relatively large share of the national budget (27 percent in 1976), and
considered the need for more cost effective delivery systems. Yet the
Project did not provide direct support to strengthen central Government
planning in the sector. Rather the project was designed to effect change
by means of a pilot Project. In the event it was through more drastic
Government measures that the education share of GDP was declining. The
share of the national budget going to education declined from 30 percent in
1982/83 to 19 percent in 1986 and the proportion of the education budget
devoted to staff salaries rose from 90 pcrcent to 98 percent between 1980
and 1986.
5.04     The Project as designed was a bold step in its effort to reform
basic education. As with so many reform efforts, the actual change
achieved has turned out to be disappointingly limited. The lessons of
similar reform efforts should have cautioned the Bank on the large and
wide-ranging scope of the reform and on the country capacity to implement
the Project.
5.05     In another sense, the Project design for basic education was
extremely ambitious and almost guaranteed to mobilize opposition to one or
other part of it. It attempted too many things - administrative
decentralization, changes in curricula, school calendar, language of
instruction and teacher:student ratios, combining urban and rural areas and
so on. Thus, it was well set to encounter obstacles at the level of
communities, unions, and persons unaware of the need for some of the
changes. With a shortage of. highly trained manpower, change and
decentralization are extremely risky as they both require increased inputs
of manpower at leadership levels. In retrospect, it is clear that the
reform program was too ambitious.



- 27 -
5.06     Overall, therefore it seems clear now that the appraisal team
never came to grips with two vital areas. The first was the fragility of
the Bolivian economy which eventually asserted itself in a way which
permeated and partly frustrated almost every aspect of the Project through
the shortage of Government financing. The second was the practical
requirements of reform - the need to mobilize comsunity support and
understanding, the need to prepare the teachers for the changes and the
need to be modest in setting targets.
Project Ii4lementation
5.07     Some 56 man-weeks were devoted to supervising the Project.  This
is also high compared with other Projects in the region, but justified by
the unusual problems and by the protracted implementation period. The
average number of missions to the country was one every sis months;
however, during 1978, there was one every three months, in the critical
start-up phase, while between 1979 and 1980 and during 1982 and 1985 the
missions took place at 12-month intervals.
5.08     There were difficulties in Project accounting, especially in FOMO,
and Bank field supervision proved insufficient to put Project accounting on
the right road. The audits carried out revealed such defects as inadequate
records and entries, lack of supporting information and documentation and
lack of control over the Project. All this rendered the work of
evaluation more difficult.

CHAPTE VI
CONCLUSIONS
6.01     The First Education Project in Bolivia experienced major
implementation problems--in part, because of a very difficult economic and
financial situation which resulted in the Government experiencing extreme
difficulty in meeting its financing obligations; and in part, because
Project design was complex and ambitious.
6.02     The objectives were worthwhile and there were some definite
achievements. There was sxpansion of primary school places and development
of teacher training, a new curriculum for the primary cycle. Some
expansion of the vocational training capacity of FOMO was achieved. FOMO
has also succeeded in establishing a national courses certification system
in some trade areas and an enterprise training unit, along with a
vocational guidance and employment service and a management training and
consultancy unit.
6.03     However, most of the more innovative elements of the Project were
not successfully carried out. In the case of basic and community
education, the effort at bilingual education was held up by a policy
change. The teacher:pupil ratio, far from being halved, slightly
increased. The proposed emphasis on practical activities was faced with a
budget which increasingly emphasized salaries to the exclusion of almost
all else. The use of radio for primary and community education was
somewhat frustrated by the failure to procure radio sets for the schools
and limited by the failure to provide adequate funding for the Community
Radio service.
6.04     The vocational training component was effectively curtailed by the
slow and limited progress in procuring buildings and the failure to acquire
mobile training workshops. Consequently, the training capacity of FOMO in
terms of output of skilled persons fell far short of expectations.
6.05     The experience with this Project reaffirms the importance of
designing Projects within the managerial capacity of the implementing
agency and, on sensitive issues, paying closer attention to the need for
wide consensus within the education community (teachers, unions, parents)
on the nature and p.rposes of reform and its requirements.
