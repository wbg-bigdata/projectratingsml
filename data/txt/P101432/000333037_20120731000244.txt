A. SUMMARY

1.      After an in-depth Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the Project in December 2011, the Bank
team and OSE proposed a restructuring to: (i) measure the Non Revenue Water (NRW)
intermediate indicators using a metric that is now considered industry best practice and will
provide a more detailed understanding of the NRW Reduction Program’s progress; and (ii)
adjust the Environmental intermediate indicators to better align them with OSE’s current vision
for environmental management.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.    The Project is progressing satisfactorily. The Project has also already reached the Project
Development Objective (PDO) indicators and 15 of the 22 intermediate indicators.

3.      The Mid-Term Review carried out in December 2011 showed that the Project has been
instrumental in supporting OSE’s transition to a management model that delivers more
accountable, customer-orientated water and sanitation services. Specifically, the Project assisted
with: (i) the integration of commercial and operational systems; (ii) the modernization of human
resources management; (iii) the application of up to date financial management and procurement
systems; and (iv) the implementation of the first phase of a Geographical Information System. In
addition, OSE has been able to increase the treatment capacity of the Aguas Corrientes Plant,
ensuring access to potable water in Montevideo through 2030. The NRW reduction program
helped OSE recuperate 14.2 million m3 of water in the systems the Project targeted in 2010
saving US$6.8 million. The Project also helped OSE connect 8,919 households to the sewer
system.

4.     From now until the Project’s closure, OSE will focus its efforts on completing works at
the Aguas Corrientes Water Treatment Plant, implementing NRW reduction activities,
connecting households to sewerage systems, as well as consolidating the environmental
management and the institutional renewal programs.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

5.     During the December 2011 MTR, OSE proposed changes to the NRW reduction and
environmental intermediate indicators.

6.      The NRW indicators are currently measured as the percentage of water billed over water
elevated, a measurement that has recognized limitations. Measuring NRW loss in liter per
connection per day allows for a more detailed analysis and is now widely considered best
practice for measuring water losses. The progress that OSE has made towards reducing NRW is
better captured and understood through this metric. For these reasons, the Bank team and OSE
decided to present a restructuring proposal to adjust the metric of this indicator. . In addition to
changing the units of measurement, the Bank team and OSE will propose a change in the
                                                  2
baseline used in the PAD to reflect more advanced studies OSE performed on NRW loss levels
after the publication of the PAD. Beyond the changes in baseline and the changes in units of
measure, the NRW reduction program would remain unchanged. There are no changes in scope.
The shaded columns indicate the revised values in liters per connection per day, which are also
included in Annex 1. The original goals are under “Goals for December 2012, PAD unbilled
water.?

7.      The Environmental Management indicators should be revised so they more accurately
reflect OSE’s current vision for environmental management. The APL2 relied on an
Environmental Assessment (EA) that was conducted in 2007. This EA served as the base for the
establishment of OSE’s Environmental Management Plan (EMP). Based on the programs in the
2007 EMP, an environmental intermediate indicator (that was a composite of six indicators)1 was
designed. Changes in certain external conditions and OSE’s vision for environmental
management led to varying degrees of compliance with the EMP’s original programs. In
particular, two of the indicators, described in the table below, lost all validity.

                                                                                          suspend these activities and adopt other best

 The six indicators are as follows: (i) Environmental assessment of the WSS programs in the capital cities; (ii) Environmental Study of the Santa
Lucia River; (iii) Plants with environmental management systems (ISO14001) implemented; (iv) Environmental guides for the design of WSS
projects; (v) Study to analyze alternatives for sludge management in potable water and wastewater treatment plants; and (vi) Capital departments
with environmental monitoring programs for treatment plants.

                                                                         3
8.       Given these changes, the Bank recommended that OSE revise its 2007 EMP to better
align it with the programmed activities, time frames and budgets, as well as the continuity of
environmental management activities under the new lending operation in preparation. OSE and
the Bank team agreed on an updated EMP during the December 2011 MTR. During the MTR,
OSE also proposed changes to the environmental management indicators to ensure that they
were aligned with OSE’s revised EMP. The changes are detailed in Figure 3. OSE will comply
with the environmental indicator if it achieves four of the five targets (or 80 percent as indicated
in Annex 1).

9.     The selection of this new set of indicators, which modify or substitute those initially
defined in 2007, supports OSE’s environmental policies and actions that are included in the
“OSE Sustainable and Efficient Project, as indicated below.

       Environmental capacity building is proposed for the entire organization and not just for the
        Environmental Management Unit
       Through the preparation of the EMW and the development of EDGs, OSE is looking not only
        for an improvement and an expansion of the application of the environmental procedures and
        requirements, but also for the active involvement of technical staff from different areas of the
        company in their definition
       The development of an Environmental Database, defined with modular criteria in order to
        develop progressively, will permit the systemization of data uploading, the organization of
        information, and the improvement of report generation. The first modular stage will be the
        monitoring of wastewater effluent. Other modules will be included in the new Project.




                                                                4
   The sludge characterization generated in OSE’s plants will form a basis for the selection and
    implementation of pilot tests that are included in the EMP and expected to take place under
    the new project.
11.    The updated EMP for the project, including the agreed proposed changes, will be re-
disclosed by August 15, 2012. The proposed changes do not represent a significant change in
terms of safeguard policy related issues.
10.    The Project team will continue reviewing the progress of the proposed indicators during
supervision missions.
