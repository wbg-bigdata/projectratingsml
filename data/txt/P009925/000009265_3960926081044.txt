MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
INDIA
FOR THE TALCHER THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1.      The following report on a proposed loan to India for US$375.0 million
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be at the standard IBRD
variable interest rate and would be repayable over 20 years incLuding 5 years
grace. It would assist in financing a coal-fired power station in the State
of Orissa and a satellite communications network for the National Thermal
Power Corporation (NTPC).
2.      Background.  India continues to face severe power shortages and the
Government of India (GOI)'s strategy for the power subsector, outlined in
the Seventh Plan, calls for the accelerated exploitation of indigenous energy
resources to alleviate these shortages. The Eastern Region, comprising
Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa, three of the poorest states in India, con-
tinues to suffer from chronic shortages of power. This has led to substan-
tial pressures to postpone maintenance of equipment in order to keep plants
in operation. Consequently, plant availability is now substantially lower
than in any other region in India. The Central Electricity Authority (CEA)
has prepared a rehabilitation program to improve the efficiency and increase
the output of existing power plants and this is currently being implemented.
However, despite this program, the Eastern Region still needs substantial new
generating capacity to meet the forecast demand ior electricity. The
proposed Talcher thermal power station is the first phase of a 3,aOO MW power
generation complex, which forms part of the least cost power development plan
for the Eastern Region. The power station would utilize coal from the exten-
sive reserves of the Talcher coalfield, which will be cheap to exploit but
which, in common with many other coals in India, have a rather high and
abrasive ash content. The executing agency for the project would be the
National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), which is owned by GOI and would
therefore be less subject than State Electricity Boards to local .ressures to
maximise present generation at the expense of future plant performance.
NTPC's power stations and lines, both existing and planned, are generally in
remote areas which have inadequate communication facilities. NTPC's project
implementation and operational capabilities are seriously hampered by this
constraint. In order to address this problem the proposed Project includes a
satellite-based data processing and communications network.
3.      Project Objectives.  The principal objectives of the proposed Project
are to: a} increase power generation capacity and hence alleviate power
shortages in the Eastern Region; (b) introduce to India the technology of
"tower boilers" which are suited to the abrasive high ash coals prevalent in
India; and (c) improve the operational performance of NTPC by providing
on-line communications between NTPC's power stations and its headquarters in
Delhi.



-2-
4.      Project Description.  The proposed Project comprises:  (a) the con-
struction of the first stage (2x500 MW) of a 3,000 MW coal-fired steam power
station in Talcher, Orissa, including boilers, turbogenerators, electrical
and mechanical auxiliaries, associated civil works and switchyard; (b) con-
struction of about 230 km of double circuit 400-kV transmission lines to link
the power station with the Eastern Region grid at Rengali and Rourkela and
40 km of 220-kY transmission line for the start-up of the power station;
(c) installation of the earth stations, microwave links and data processing
equipment for a satellite-based data communications network connecting NTPC's
corporate offices in Delhi with its power stations; and (d) consulting serv-
ices to review the engineering of the proposed power station. The total cost
of the Project is estimated at US$1,375.3 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$524.2 million (38%). A breakdown of costs, the
financing plan and retroactive financing arrangements are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of the Bank Group operations in India are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map, IBRD No. 19618R, is attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6402-IN dated May 28, 1987, is being distributed
separately.
5.      Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The power plant is a component of
the least-cost power expansion plan for the Eastern Region and its construc-
tion by NTPC is consistent with the Bank's sector development strategy of
supporting the expansion of the central sector in parallel with assistance to
individual SEBs. Through its participation in the project, the Bank would:
(a) help to improve the power supply to the Eastern Region, one of the
poorest areas in India and one whose industrial base is currently being
crippled by power shortages; (b) assist India to accelerate exploitation of
cheap indigenous coal reserves; (c) assist in the transfer of technology
through the introduction of tower boilers; and (d) support improvements in
the operational performance of NTPC through the provision of on-line com-
munications between NTPC's power stations and its headquarters in Delhi. In
addition the Bank has already, through involvement in this Project, helped to
stimulate an effective mechanism for recovery of NTPC's receivables, i.e.
diversion of central assistance to the states.
6.      Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed that:  (a) signature of  a
subsidiary loan agreement with, specifying a minimum interest rate of 14Z and
repayment over 20 years including 5 years grace, would be a condition of
effectiveness; (b) clearance of the Department of the Environment would be a
condition of effectiveness; (c) absence of Department of Forests and Wildlife
clearance for the transmission lines after December 31, 1989 would be an
event of suspension. NTPC has agreed to: (a) provide the Bank with a satis-
factory resettlement plan by December 31, 1987, and, thereafter, ensure the
timely execution of the plan; (b) enter into a contract for the supply of
coal to proposed power station, at least one year prior to the first unit's



-3-
operation; the contract would be subject to prior review and comment by the
Bank; (c) complete route surveys for the transmission lines and submit an
application for forest clearance by March 31, 1988; (d) maintain its accounts
receivable at a level not exceeding an amount equivalent to the proceeds of
its power sales for the two preceding months; (e) achieve annual rates of
return on unrevalued net assets in operation of not less than 7% through
1989/90, 9.5% in 1990/91 through 1994/95, and thereafter annual rates of
return it levels satisfactory to ensure the financial viability of NTPC; and
(f) submit to the Bank audited financial statements within seven months of
the end of the financial year.
7.      Justification.  The proposed Project is justified as part of the
least-cost plan of power supply to the Eastern Region. The economic rate of
return of the expansion program for the Eastern Region, of which the the
proposed Project is an integral part, is about 10% according to benefits
based on incremental revenues at retail tariffs and quantifiable industrial
and agricultural consumer' surplus. The actual rate of return would be
considerably higher if domestic consumer surplus and other external benefits
were taken into consideration.
8.      Risks.  No unusual risks are foreseen in the execution of the
Project. Risk of damage due to fire, explosion, and other accidents would be
covered by the respective contractors dtiring the construction phase, and,
after commissioning, by NTPC through its insurance policies. Technical risks
would be minimized by the use of consultants where NTPC has inadequate
experience e.g. in the review of the design of tower boilers.
9.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
