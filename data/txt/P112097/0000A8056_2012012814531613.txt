                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The long-awaited Technical Implementation Support Consultancy (TISC) commenced its work on March 1, 2011. The capacity building activities for the Project Planning Unit (PPU)
                         and Water Resources Planning Unit (WRPU) are underway. The formation of a multi-disciplinary team in Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) to handle trans-boundary issues is
                         slowly taking place. During the implementation support mission of October 2011, the Bank team assessed the performance of the TISC as unsatisfactory and the ratings on progress
                         towards achievement of the PDO and on implementation progress have been downgraded to “Moderately Unsatisfactory?.
