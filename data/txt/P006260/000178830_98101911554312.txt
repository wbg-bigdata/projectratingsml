APPRAISAL OF THE
ITUMBIARA HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT
FURNAS - CENTRAIS ELETRICAS, S.A.
BRAZIL
SUMMARY AND CONCUJSICNS
i.        The Brazilian power sector is administratively complex.  Power
facilities are owned and operated by Federal, State and private companies
umder the control of the Ministry of Mines and Energy through its
Department of Water and Klectric Energy which awards concessions and
approves tariffs and Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, S.A. (ELETROBRAS)
an agency which has two functions: (a) to set up and own federal power
companies, and (b) to coordinate the financial and technical resources
of the sector. ELETROBRAS has not been completely effective in its
coordination role mainly because it has lacked the authority to impose
its decisions on the sector companies. However, a proposed new law presented
to the Brazilian Congress on May 15, 1973 could give ELETROBRAS the necessary
authority to plan and control the use of the electric power sector resources
effectively.
ii.       The proposed loan would be an appropriate vehicle to help strengthen
ELETROBRAS' position in the power sector by committing the Government to
integrated planning and operation of sector facilities. The Government agreed
during negotiations to complete the revision of its existing Power Development
Plans for the Southeast and the South Regions.  At present, these regions
make up about 87% of the sector in terms of energy produced and consumed.
The proposed loan would also expose the Brazilian civil works contractors to
international competitive bidding and would allow Furnas - Centrais Eletricas, S.A.
(FURNAS), the borrower, to obtain the maximum possible amount of foreign
financing compatible with its requirements.
iii.      This report appraises a project consisting of a dam and 2,080 MW
hydroelectric power station at Itumbiara on the Paranaiba River, about 520 km
of 500 kV, 350 km of 345 kV, and 890 km of 138 kV transmission lines and
associated transformer and switching stations. The project is estimated to
cost US$593 million equivalent, excluding interest during construction; it
would be part of the borrower's expansion program which in the construction
period of the project is estimated to cost US$1,777 million equivalent.
iv.       The proposed Bank loan would be for US$125 million equivalent
for a term of 30 years including 7 years of grace and would bear interest
at 7-1/4%. It would be the sixth Bank loan to Furnas - Centrais Eletricas, S.A.
(FURNAS), an autonomous electric utility company owned principally by the
Federal Government, and would be guaranteed by the Brazilian Government. The
loan would be the twenty-sixth to the Brazilian power sector. The proposed
loan would finance the estimated foreign component of the civil works for the



- ii -
dam and hydroelectric station; it would also finance about US$65 million of
equipment purchased after international competitive bidding, with a 15% margin
of preference given to Brazilian manufacturers. The remainder of the equip-
ment is expected to be financed under parallel financing arrangements.
v.        The project is technically sound.  Its estimated cost and the
proposed construction schedule are reasonable. The facilities to be provided
are needed by FURNAS to meet its part of the expected demand in the Southeast
region of Brazil, and are in accord with the aims of the Regional Integrated
Development Plan which is currently being revised. The environmental impact
of the project is expected to be small. Action required of the Borrower
would consist mainly in the relocation of about 3,700 persons.
vi.       The load forecast for the Southeast region is reasonable; the
Itumbiara project is the least cost solution; and the return on the project
investment is 22.9%.
vii.      FURNAS is an acceptable borrower.  It is ably managed enjoys
the benefits of favorable tariff legislation and has access to the resources
of ELETROBRAS which administers a substantial proportion of the resources
of the powsr sector. FURNAS' present financial performance and future
outlook are equally good.
viii.     The project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan.



APPRAISAL OF THE
ITUIIBIARA HYDROELECTRIC PO4ER PROJECT

BRAZIL
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Furnas - Centrais Eletricas,S.A. (FURNAS), a corporation almost
wholly-owned by the Federal Government through Centrais Eletricas Brasilairas
S.A. (ELETROBRAS), has asked the Bank to help finance the Itumbiara Project
consisting of a 2,080 MW hydroelectric power plant on the Paranaiba River and
associated 500 kV, 345 kV and 138 kV transmission systems having a total
estimated cost of US$593 million equivalent.
1.02      A loan of US$125 million equivalent is proposed to finance the
estimated amount of the foreign exchange component of the civil works contract
(U,;bo million) for the dam and hydroelectric station and an estimated
US$65 million of equipment contracts for the hydroelectric station and the
transmission system. The remaining part of the external financing of US$76 million
would be provided under parallel financing arranged by FURNAS (paragraph 4.11).
1.03      The Bank loan would represent about 7% of FURNAS' total investment
program of US$1,777 million equivalent for 1973-1982 - the project construction
period - and it is expected that the Bank's participation in the financing of
the project would allow FURNAS to obtain the maximum possible additional
external financing.
1.04      The Bank has made five previous loans to FURNAS for a total of
US$271.3 million and 25 previous loans to the Brazilian power sector for a
total of US$747.1 million. All previous loans to FURNAS have helped to
finance hydroelectric plants and/or related transmission systems, as follows:
(a)  Loan 211-BR (1958) for US$73 million for the 900 MW Furnasl-/
plant; these facilities are in operation;
(b)  Loan 403-BR (1965) for US$57 million for the 1,050 MW
Estreito plant; these facilities were completed with
substantial cost savings and are now in operation;
(c)  Loan 474-BR (1966) for US$39 million for the Estreito
transmission; the present closing date is June 30, 1974 and
the construction is on schedule;

Falls on the Rio Grande.



-2-
(d) Loan 565-BR (1968) for US$22.3 million for the 360 MW
Porto Colombia plant. Changes in design have increased
local costs substantially; the closing date is December 31, 1973
and construction is on schedule; and
(e)  Loan 677-BR (1970) for US$80 million for the 1,400 MW
Marimbondo plant and transmission system and 300 MW of
additional capacity in the Furnas plant; there have been
cost overruns due to higher than anticipated equipment
prices and additional transmission equipment. The closing
date is May 31, 1977 and construction is currently on
schedule.
The Bank's experience with the Borrower has been satisfactory.
1.05      This report is based on a feasibility report prepared by FURNAS
with the assistance of Companhia Internacional de Engenharia and on the
findings of a Bank mission composed of Messrs. Guy Prenoveau, Renato Salazar,
and Ralph L. Bloorl/ which visited Brazil in January/February 1973 and a
supplemental visit by Mr. Ralph L. Bloor in May 1973.

2. THE POWER SECTOR
Organization of the Power Sector
2 .01     The power sector in Brazil is organized into Federal, State and
private concessionaires. Federal and State utilities accounted for about
70% of the country's total installed capacity of 13,600 MW in 1972. The
private segment of the power sector now consists almost entirely of one
large company, Light-Servicos de Eletricidade, S. A. (LIGHT) - a subsidiary
of a Canadian firm - which serves the Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo areas.
2.02      For planning purposes there are five power regions in Brazil:
South, Southeast, Central-West, Northeast and North, each having distinctive
characteristics. The most important region is the Southeast comprising the
five states of Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Guanabara, Rio de Janeiro and
Espirito Santo; it accounts for about 80% of the country's installed capacity.
The Borrower's system accounts for about 28% of the capacity of the South-
east Region.
2.03      The Ministry of Mines and Energy controls the power sector through
its Department of Water and Electric Energy (DNAEE) which performs regulatory
functions, including granting licenses for hydroelectric sites, assigning
concession areas, setting tariffs and approving expansion plans.  DNAEE is
not a strong department, even though it has broad legal authority. It denends
on the utilities themselves to carry out many of its functions and it finds
it difficult to withstand political pressures from the States as regards the
granting of licenses for hydroelectric sites. In the early sixties, it
permitted what is now Centrais Eletricas de Sao Paulo, S. A. (CESP) to build
extensive 460 kV transmission facilities although it was widely known that
500 kV would be the standard for the country; both voltage levels are now in
use accompanied by serious integration problems.
2.04      Financial and technical coordination within the sector is the
responsibility of ELETROBRAS, a government agency under the Ministry of Mines
and Energy, which has direct control of 13 federal utilities and minor
interest in 23 state utilities. ELETROBRAS collects and allocates public
funds used for electrification and expansion programs and plays a coordinat-
ing role in the planning and operation of the country's power systems.
ELETROBRAS has not been completely effective mostly because it has lacked
the legal authority to demand information from state companies and to impose
it decisions on them. A proposed new law currently under consideration by
the Brazilian Congress (Annex J would place ELETROBRAS firmly in charge of
the technical coordination, financing and administration of the electric
power sector and make it responsible through four of its existing subsidiaries,
ELETROSUL, FURNAS, CHESF and ELETRONORTE for generating schemes affecting more
than one State, for HV and EHV transmission systems aimed at integratinz state
systems, and for transmission systems related to international power projects.
The proposed law would give ELETROBRAS sufficient authority to ensure the
optimum integrated planning of the secotr, an objective the Bank has been
actively supporting in Brazil. The mission feels that the proposed loan will



- h -
help to further strengthen ELETROBRAS' position by committing the
Brazilian Government to integrated planning (paragraph 2.12). Recently,
ELETROBRAS' financial resources have increased (paragraph 2.14) which
will also improve its abilitv to coordinate the sector netiirities.
The Southeast Region
2.o5      There are twelve power utilities operating interconnected in the
Southeast region. Generation and bulk transmission facilities are owned
principally by three government entities, FURNAS, CESP, and Centrais Electricas
de Minas Gerais (CEMIG), and one privately owned company, LIGHT. FURNAS is
a bulk supplier, CESP and CEMIG are responsible for both bulk and retail
supply, and LIGHT mostly for retail supply.
2.06      The generating facilities of these companies are predominantly
hydroelectric and are located mainly on the Parana River and its tributaries.
Their supply areas are contiguous and have been defined by mutual agreement.
FURNAS is responsible for supplies in the States of Guanabara and Rio de
Janeiro and for partial supply of the city of Sao Pauloand the State of
Espirito Santo; outside of the Southeast region FURNAS supplies Brasilia
and adjacent areas. CEMIG is owned chiefly by the State of Minas Gerais
and is responsible for that State's power supply; CESP is owned by the
State of Sao Paulo and ib responsible for the bulk of that State's supply,
the balance coming from Companhia Paul-ista de Forca e Luz (CPFL), FURNAS
and LIGHT.
2.07      During 1963 - 1965 a comprehensive power survey was carried out
by CANAMERA 1/ to develop power supply in the Southeast region in a coordinat-
ed manner. This was financed by UNDP, with the Bank as Executing Agency.
This study identified a series of low-cost hydroelectric sites from which
CANAMERA drew up a program of expansion, predominantly hydroelectric, for
the period 1965-1980. Until recently, power development in the region has
followed the CANAMBRA report and many of the projects recommended therein
have been built or are under construction.
2.08      The CANAMBRA study may be considered the most important step taken
in Brazil to date to rationalize the development of the Southeast power
resources. Of necessity, a study of this magnitude did not go into the
kind of detail necessary for the actual construction of a project, nor
did it attempt to give weight to elements such as varying capacity factors,
etc., for individual plants. There have been important instances - for
example Volta Grande - where the CANAMBRA study was used partly in lieu
of a more detailed study with the result that major elements of a dam
have had to be changed after the start of construction, with severe cost
overruns. Nevertheless, the CANAMBRA study has been invaluable. With the
passing of time, load forecasts have been revised; in 1969 for instance
1/ A consortium of Canadian and American consulting firms.



- 5 -
ELETROBRAS made a complete restudy of load growth in the region. Currently,
it is revising this study and expects to complete it during 1973. Since
the CANAMBRA study was made, there have been substantial changes in the
relative costs of generating and transmission schemes and the order of
priority of potential projects established by CANAMBRA car no longer be
assumed to be valid. Up to now, power generation concessions have been
granted on the basis of the requirements of the individual utility.
Furthermore, the concessions have been granted in such a way that more
than one utility now operates on the same river, thus making necessary
the coordination of the water management of reservoirs. The superimposi-
tion of Federal power generation companies upon the State companies and the
Government decision that LIGHT (the major distribution company in the South-
east region) will not expand its power generation facilities have made large
inter-utility transfers of power a nornal mode of operation. The major bulk
producers are more mature than they were 10 years ago and are in a better
position to cope with the existing situation and to undertake the next phase
of planning which would lay more emphasis on an optimum, integrated use of
resources.
2.09      Interconnected operation of the utilities of the Southeast region
has been marked by gradually increasing efficiency. A Committee for the
Coordination of Operations has been meeting regularly since 1969 and has
made substantial progress in such matters as allocation of spinning and
maintenance reserve capacity.  The Committee was particularly effective
during 1969 and 1971, critically poor water years in Sao Paulo and Minas
Gerais respectively, in coordinating interchanges of power and reservoir
operation to avoid power curtailment. On these occasions it was realized as
never before that the non-hydroelectric generation facilities - originally
conceived to take care of the requirements of each individual utility -
should be operated for the benefit of the whole region. W1en concentrated
at specific points near the load center, conventional thermal or nuclear
generating facilities can be used to take advantage of the economy of scale
and optimize the cost of the required infrastructure.
2.10      At the beginning of 1973, in a meeting of CEMG, FURNAS and CESP,
arranged by ELETROBRAS, agreement was reached on the interconnection of their
Sao Simao, Itumbiara and Agua Vermelha plants by a 500 kV transmission network
in which power will be transmitted in any direction without payment of wheeling./
charges to the line owners (paragraph 4.04).
2.11      In the above context and in conjunction with Loan 829-BR to CEMIG,
the Government agreed to authorize future generation projects in the South-
east region only in accordance with a Regional Generation Development Plan
based on the efficient and coordinated operation of the generating facilities
of the region. ELETROBRAS is in the process of preparing such a Development
Plan. In December 1972, an advanced copy of its report was submitted to the
Bank in preparation for the Itunbiara Appraisal, The report verified that
the individual non-integrated expansion programs of the three major power
producers of the region - FURNAS, CEMIG and CESP would cover the requirements

of the region until 1979 but it did not present a plan for the optimum
integrated use of sector resources. The Bank so advised ELETROBRAS which
has since presented the necessary justification for Itumbiara (Chapter 5
of this report).
2.12      The need for integrated planning and development of sector faiilities
is not restricted to the Southeast region. Although of relatively lesser
importance in total installed capacity and kilometers of transmission, other
regions would benefit from integrated planning. For instance, recent actions
taken or under consideration in the South - the introduction of unscheduled
rid apparently unnecessary generating capacity in a market where current
demand is lower than had been forecast, the addition of costly steam power
instead of low-cost hydro power, the obligation for Centrais Eletricas do
Sul do Brasil, S.A. (ELETROSUL) to operate high-cost, coal-burning thermal
stations rather than to use its available hydroelectric power - point to
the need for a more rational approach. During negotiations the Government
agreed to complete the Southeast Region and South Region Generation and
Major Transmission Development Plans and to transmit them to the Bank for
comment no later than November 1, 1973 for the Plans covering the parlod
1973-81 and no later than Novsmber 1, 1974, for the period 1982-1990. The
Government also agreed to communicate to the Bank any proposed significant
change to these plans and give the Bank an opportunity to comment on it
before it is adopted.
Tariffs
2.13      The Brazilian tariff policy is to provide electric utilities with
sufficient funds to cover their operating expenses and to allow a reasonable
return on their investment; it also provides for treating similar consumer
groups alike, and for taking into account different load factors in setting
the tariffs. Under Brazilian legislation, a rate of return of up to 10% on
remunerable investment (revalued assets in operation plus various current
assets) was in effect through 1271.  As a result of changes introduced in
this legislation in May 1971,tI a rate of return of not less than 10% and
not more than 12% is mandatory beginning in 1972. Surcharges to cover
increases in operating costs and exchange losses arising out of servicing
foreign debt can continue to be made automatically. The consumers also
pay ad ttional sums on their electricity bills for taxes and the compulsory
loans,J the proceeds of which are collected for ELETROBRAS which lends them
to operating companies for plant expansion.
2.14      Until the end of 1971, the electric utilities had the choice to
recover in their tariffs - in addition to depreciation - either "amortization"t
for amounts of up to 5% of their fixed assets in operation or "reversion"
for up to 3% of the same base. Y  Effective 1972, a new law has made  treversion"
mandatory except that funds must be turned over to ELETROBRAS which has the
authority to select borrowers. "Reversion" funds represent about 17% of the
sector's own resources and hopefully the new arrangements will strengthen
ELETROBRAS' position in the sector.
LJ See Annex 2



- 7 -
2.15      It is mandatory for the electric utilities to earn between 10%
and 12% on their investment (paragraph 2.13). During negotiations FURNAS
agreed to continue maintaining its earnings at levels consistent with
sound financial and public utility practices and in accordance with Brazilian
legislation and to apply for appropriate tariff adjustments no later than
five months after the end of each calendar year; and the Government agreed
to continue to act promptly on these tariff applications. During negotia-
tions, the Government also agreed that any change in its legislation which,
in the Bank's opinion, would adversely affect the Borrower's financial
position would, as in the case of previous loans, be considered an event of
default.



3. THE BORROWER
3.01      The Borrower would be FURNAS, an autonomous Government corporation
established in 1957 and the largest subsidiary of ELETROBRAS.  FURNAS is a
bulk producer and sells only to other utilities at wholesale.  It is a major
supplier for the Rio de Janeiro market through LIGHT and several smaller
distributors, for the Sao Paulo market through LIGHT and one other small
company, and it also sells to CEMIG and Companhia Eletrica de Brasilia, S.A.
(CEB).  Its source of energy comes principally from three hydroelectric
plants it has constructed on the Rio Grande several hundred kilometers from
its markets; and it has built an extensive high-voltage transmission system
to reach these markets.
3.02      The share capital of FURNAS as of December 1972, was Cr$1,300 million
divided equally between ordinary and preferred shares and held more than 95%
by ELETROBRAS, the remainder being held by CEMIG, Departamento de Aguas e
Energia Eletrica do Estado de Sao Paulo (DAEE), LIGHT, CPFL and CESP.
Organization
3.03      A 12-member council appointed by the Government directs FURNAS.
Six of the members are executive directors, and the other six are in Govern-
ment and business. The executive directors are the President, the Vice
President (Technical), the Vice President (Operations and Planning), and
the three heads of the Departments of Administration, Finance, and Contracts.
FURNAS' staff of about 4,650 employees is reasonable. It is distributed
among its major departments as follows: Technical 1,170 - of which 780 are
in construction; Operations and Planning 1,910; Administration 1,050; Finance
2703 and Contracts 250. FURNAS does a considerable amount of construction
work with its own forces, such as preparatory work at construction sites which
would be difficult to accomplish by contract. Furthermore, many of its
personnel do work which ordinarily would be done in government bureaus
(paragraph 2.03), such as coordinating the operation of all utilities in the
region, assisting in the preparation of tariff regulations and market studies,
and solving other country-wide utility problems (see Organization Chart).
3.04      The organization of FURNAS has developed well -- due partly to a
qualified, hard-working group of executive directors and partly to the tech-
nical and financial assistance furnished by the Bank and other development
financing institutions. Some 20 employees annually are sent to the United
States and to European countries for graduate study and for practical train-
ing in the technical and financial fields. In addition, FURNAS has converted
some of the buildings in the construction village at the Furnas dam into a
training school for operating and maintenance technicians, who are drawn from
its own organization as well as from other utilities in Brazil. For the
design and construction of major projects, FURNAS employs consulting engineers
and hires contractors (paragraphs 4.05 to 4.08).



-9-
Market
3.05      All power generated by FURNAS is sold under contract to other
utilities for resale to the ultimate consumers: these utilities also have
generating facilities of their own, the largest of which is LIGHT serving
the areas of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. The utilities which purchase
FURNAS' power and their actual and projected sales and peaks are shown in
Annex 3. In 1972, FURNAS' energy sales were 11.4 TWh (1,335 average MW)
and the maximum demand was 2,180 MW; total energy sales in the Southeast
region for that year were 38 TWh (provisional figures).
Facilities
3.06      As Brazil's largest Federal public utility, FURNAS has substantial
generating facilities as shown below:

500 kV transmission lines which will be partially completed in 1973 and
fully completed in 1976.

- 10 -
Generating Expansion Program
3.08      As shown in paragraph 3.06, FURNAS has 2,770 MW of capacity in
operation and 2,850 MW under construction to be completed by 1977. The
Porto Colombia units will come on line in 1973 and 1974; and in order to
avoid a shortage in reserve capacity in those years, FURNAS plans to install
units Nos. 7 and 8 of 150 MW each in the spaces available for them in the
Furnas powerhouse.  The 1,400 MW of Marimbondo is scheduled to come in start-
ing in1975 and to be completed early in 1977. The 2,080 NW of Itumbiara is
scheduled to come in starting in late 1979 and to be completed early in 1981
(see Annex 4 for energy balance graphs). FURNAS has been given the responsi-
bility by the Government to construct Brazil's first nuclear plant (630 MW
gross capacity); this plant, which is partly financed by the Import-Export
Bank of USA is scheduled for completion in 1977, but full commercial operation
is not considered likely before 1978. This later date appears to be satis-
factory with respect to FURNAS' ability to meet its market requirements. Any
program beyond the Itumbiara plant will require further study before expendi-
ture is committed for additional plant since the market requirements may
deviate somewhat from present estimates. During negotiations FURNAS agreed
that until the Project has been completed it will not carry out any major
program of expansion of its generation and transmission facilities without
giving the Bank evidence that such expansion is in accord with the Southeast
Region and South Region Generation and Major Transmission Development Plans
(paragraph 2.12) for such facilities and that adequate financial resources
are available. For this purpose, a major expansion is one the cost of which
exceeds 2% of the gross fixed assets in operation plus work in progress.
Insurance
3.09      FURNAS' insurance program is detailed in Annex 5; it appears
satisfactory.

THE PROJECT
Description
4.01      The principal features of the Project are:
(a) The main dam 7 km long comprising:
(i) concrete spillway, intake and transition sections
involving 2.3 million m3 of concrete work; and
(ii) earth-fill embankment sections on both banks,
involving 30 million m  of fill, with a maximum
height of 106 m.
(b) A conventional indoor type power station with eight
generating units rated at 260 MW each.
(c) Single-circuit 500 kV transmission lines; a 345 kV line
to Brasilia; and 138 kV system expansion in Rio de Janeiro
and extending into the State of Espirito Santo (see Annex 6
for details and scheduling).
(d)  The corresponding 500 kV, 345 kV and 138 kV transformer
substations.
4.02      The dam and hydroelectric power station designed for 2,080 NW
are located on the paranaiba River approximately 1,200 km northwest of
Rio de Janeiro, about 800 km from Siao Paulo and 420 km from Brasilia;
the transmission facilities consist of 523 km of single-circuit 500 kV
lines to interconnect Itumbiara with the Sao Simao and Marimbondo and
Agua Vermelha with Marimbondo hydroelectric plants, 350 km of single-
circuit 345 kV line to transmit power from Itumbiara to Brasilia, 150 km
of single-circuit 138 kV line to interconnect the Santa Cruz thermal
plant with the Angra nuclear plant and the area of Parati and two 370 km
138 kV double-circuit lines to interconnect Adrianopolis in the Rio
area with Cachoeiro do Itapemirim in the State of Espirito Santo (see
map 10407). The Paranaiba River, one of the major tributaries of the
Parana River, drains a basin extending south from the capital city, Brasilia,
with an area of 220,000 km2. The Itumbiara dam site, located at the upper
end of the existing Cachoeira Dourada reservoir, is at one of the locations
proposed by CANAMBRA for the development of the potential of the Paranaiba
River Basin in their "Power Studies of South Central Brazil' (now known as
the Southeast Region).
1.03      The Itumbiara dam would create a reservoir with a usable storage
capacity of 13,700 million cubic meters, regulating a catchment of 95,000 km2
which yields a mean annual flow of approximately 1,500 cubic meters per
second. Based on flood frequency studies, the spillway is designed to
pass a maximum probable flood of 16,000 cubic meters per second; it has
the same capacity as the spillway of the Cachoeira Dourada project. The



- 12 -
gross capacity of the reservoir is 17,000 million cubic meters and the
estimated deposition of sediment is 20 million cubic meters per year, a
negligible amount compared to the capacity of the reservoir. The dam
would provide an 80 m head with the reservoir at the maximum normal operating
level. The total average annual dependable energy production attributable
to the project, would be 9.0 TWh of which 6.6 TWh would be generated at
Itumbiara and the remainder at plants downstream. The installed capacity
would result in a plant factor of 36% for Itumbiara and the reservoir would
also increase the generating capability of downstream plants.
4.04      According to the agreement reached recently (paragraph 2.10)
between the three main utilities of the Region, the hydroelectric stations
of Sao Simao (CEMIG), Itumbiara (FURNAS), and partially Agua Vermelha (CESP)
will deliver their power to a common 500 kV network as shown on Map 10407.
The originally planned 500 kV transmission system of CEMIG's Sao Simao
station consisted of a double-circuit line between Sao Simao and Belo
Horizonte; one circuit of this line, for the section between Sao Simao and
Jaguara,will now be replaced by a circuit between Itumbiara and Jaguara.
FURNAS will build and own, as part of the Itumbiara 500 kV transmission
system, the lines between Itumbiara, Sao Simao and Marimbondo and between
Agua Vermelha and Marimbondo. The system as now proposed has the minimum
capital cost of the various alternatives considered. Power flow and
stability studies were carried out for the 1982-86 peak load conditions
with one circuit out of service and show that the system is stable for
such conditions. The 500 kV system will be interconnected with CESP's
460 kV system at the Agua Vermelha substation. The design characteristics
of the 500 kV, 345 kV and 115 kV lines and substations would be similar to
those of FURNAS' existing system.
Engineering and Construction
4.05      FURNAS had been granted the right to develop three consecutive
hydroelectric sites on the Paranaiba river, namely Itumbiara, Tupaciguara
and Anhanguera. With the assistance of Companhia Internacional de Engenharia -
the Brazilian branch of International Engineering of San Francisco - FURNAS
performed detailed computer studies of the Itumbiara dam height and power
installation and found it economic to increase the dam height substantially,
thereby eliminating the other two planned upstream dams while increasing the
Itumbiara storage capacity fourfold, and making possible the installation at
Itumbiara of twice the capacity originally envisaged by CANAMBRA. These
studies have been carried out using sound methods and the new plan,which results
in an aggregate gain of 650 MW of installed capacity over previous plans, can
be accepted as the optimum development of this segment of the Paranaiba river.
FURNAS also studied the merits of installing all the units at one time, as
compared to installing them in two steps and found the former to be economically
superior. Consideration is now being given to using six 350 MW generating
units instead of eight 260 MW units. If it appears that there will be sufficient
competition in bidding for th_ larger units, they will be specified and a
relatively small but worthwhile saving in cost should result.
4.o6      The dam and powerhouse form a simple layout, but they are large
structures and FURNAS has employed a consulting board of experts in geology,



- 13 -
soil mechanics, concrete, and civil engineering construction to advise its
engineering firm on the design. Rock is exposed in the river where the
concrete structures will be located and it appears to be of good quality
and presents no serious problems. However, the gently sloping abutments
where the earth embankments are to be built are covered with overburden up
to 30 meters deep, the upper part of which is highly compressible. This
is a poor foundation for practically homogeneous clay embankments, and it
will be necessary to remove some of the overburden. The estimated amount
to be removed is based on investigations completed up to May 1973 and the
cost estimates (paragraph 4.09) provide ample physical contingencies to
provide for the removal of larger amounts if further investigations show the
need.
4.07      Construction of the main civil works will be done on a unit price
basis by experienced contractors selected after international competitive
bidding.  Since FURNAS o-ns considerable construction equipment it will be
made available to the contractor. Installation of the generating plant
and other electrical equipment will be carried out by FURNAS, as has been
its successful practice in earlier projects. The erection of the transmission
line will be done by contractors under FURNASt supervision.
4.08      Construction of preliminary work for the dam and hydroelectric
plant has already been started by FURNAS under force account. As FURNAS
does not wish to start pre-qualification procedures for the civil works
contract until the Bank loan is assured, the proposed Bank loan should be
made in June 1973 in order to meet the required commissioning date. On
this basis tenders for the main civil works would be opened around November,
the contract awarded at the beginning of 1974, and work would start in the
first quarter. The first generating unit is scheduled for commissioning
in November 1979 and the remaining units at three-month intervals thereafter.
Construction of transmission facilities would start in 1975 and various
portions would be completed during the period 1977 to 1982 (see Annex 6).
The FURNAS organization with the assistance of consultants should be able
to carry out (or supervise) all the work satisfactorily and on schedule.
During negotiations FURNAS agreed to the provisions contained in previ.ous
Loan Agreements requiring the employment of consultants and contractors
satisfactory to the Bank under terms and conditions satisfactory to it.
Cost Estimates
4.09      The cost estimate was prepared in mid-1972 by FURNAS in collaboration
with the consultants and updated in May 1973 on the basis of the latest
investigations. Both these groups have broad and recent experience building
similar projects in Brazil. Based on existing designs, the estimate is
reasonable. In view of the embankment design problem (paragraph 4.06), a
contingency allowance of 20% has been added to the original estimated cost of
civil works for the dam. Other physical contingency allowances have been
provided at 10% on other parts of the dam and hydroelectric plant equipment.
A physical contingency allowance of 12% has been added to the estimated cost
of the transmission system. Price contingencies are included at the rate
of 5% per annum from the date of the estimate until the money is spent
excluding local overhead, lands, and local labor. In general, the Brazilian
monetary correction system takes care of inflation. The estimate (excluding
interest during construction) is shown below:

Amount of Proposed Loan
4.10      In addition to supporting ELETROBRAS' efforts in the sector (para-
graph 2.0C), the proposed Bank loan is aimed at helping FURNAS to secure the
maximum possible financing outside of Brazil and at exposing the Brazilian
civil works contractors to international competition. In line with these
objectives, the Bank loan would finance both equipment and civil works for
a total of US$125 million.
JI-4.1a   From the total list of equipment, FURNAS has selected main generating
equipment, power transformers, switchgear and communication equipment, estimated
at UA?76 million, which it feels are most attractive for the parallel financing
it is arranging (paragraph 1l.13) and which are either not made or not made
COnlietitivlY in Brazil. The remaining equipment such as travelling crane,
Scrie ptates, transmission line towers, ccnductors, insulatcrs and fittings
suitable for interrational competitive bidding would be financed by the proposed
Bank loan up to US$65 million regardless of whether the orders are won by
foreign or local manufacturers. The other part of the proposed Bank loan,
about US$60 million, would finance the bulk of the foreign component of the
civil works for tile dam and hydroelectric station.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.12      The civil works contracts for the dam and hydroelectric station
would be awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with



- 15 -
the Bank's procurement guidelines. Disbursement from the proposed loan
for the civil works would be made against 35% of the amount billed in the
contractor's periodic invoices, to the full amount of US$60 million. If
the civil works contract proves more or less than the estimate, the full
US$60 million would be disbursed, although the percentage would be modified
to enable disbursement over the full construction period. The US$S5 million
part of the loan would be disbursed against equipment contracts (or parts
of contracts) won after international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bankts guidelines for procurement, the Brazilian manufacturers being
given a 15% margin of preference or the actual amount of the duty whichever
is lower. No disbursements would be made from the proposed Bank loan for
costs incurred prior to signing. Any loan funds remaining undisbursed upon
completion of the project would be cancelled unless their disbursement on
other works associated with the project is appropriate. The schedule of
disbursements is given in Annex 7.
4.13      The equipment selected by FURNAS for parallel financing (paragraph
4.11) would be subject to international competitive bidding, the Brazilian
manufacturers being given the same 15% margin of preference as under the
Bank loans. FURNAS is arranging this parallel financing without assistance
from the Bank. To be responsive, a bidder will have to offer financing
terms, which will be taken into account in the bid evaluation. FURNAS has
obtained sufficient commitments from the major equipment supplying countries
to assure the success of this operation. The Bank would not supervise the
procurement of this equipment.
Environmental Aspects
4.14      At the Bank's suggestion, the environmental aspects of the project
have been studied by a consultant specializing in this field who has prepared
a comprehensive report. It is evident that the impact will be relatively
small for such a large project because of its remoteness and the low population
density in its vicinity; there are 3,700 persons to be relocated including
one town of 216, a small part of another town containing about 75 persons and
about 80 farmsteads with their proprietors and farm labor. FURNAS has not
completed its plans for the relocation of the population but is well-aware
of the socio-cultural needs of the people. During negotiations FURNAS agreed to:
(a) prepare detailed plans for the resettlement of the population
now living in the areas which will be flooded by the Itumbiara
reservoir in a manner that will enable it to earn a living
under conditions at least equal to those existing;
(b) furnish such plans to the Bank for its approval not later
than June 30, 1974; and
(c) implement such plans in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
4.15      The consultant also reports over-grazing within the watershed and
the resulting extensive erosion, the presence of schistosomiasis and Chagast
disease, etc. which are not normally under the control of a power company.
During negotiations, the Government agreed to give due consideration to the
recommendations of the Itumbiara Environmental Impact Reconnaissance Report
of November 1972.

5. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
5.01      For the reasons discussed in paragraphs 2.07 to 2.11, the justification
of Itumbiara has been made from the Regional point of view rather than from
that of the concession area of the owner utility.
Load Growth Forecast
5.02      The results of thie Power and Energy Balance study made by ELETROBRAS
for the Southeast Regl on appear in Annex 8 and show the actual and forecast
.iergy consumptiorn, peak demand, and power and energy generating capacity of
the Southeast Region for the period 1969-82. The actual annual rate of growth
of energy consumption for the past three years was 10.8% whereas the projected
growth for the Deriod 1972-82 has been assumed at 10% which is reasonable.
According to this t:able, the Region's energy requirements are adequately
covered by the proposed generating expansion program up to 1979, after which
the Region's available peaking capacity does not provide adequate reserve.
The Bank has requested ELETROBRAS to study the peaking capacity require-
ments of the Region as part of the integrated planning study.  Because
delays in commissioning future projects would cause severe shortages
of energy and power in the region, the power balance study should be kept up
to date so prompt action can be taken for the installation of alternative
generating facilities, with shorter construction periods, such as conventional
steam units or other for the steps,after Itumbiara.
Least-Cost Solu'tion
5.03      Two projects rated as high-priority in the CANAFBRA inventory were
considered as the most attractive alternatives to serve the power growth of the
Southeast Region irn the period 1972-82, after the completion of the projects
now under construction; these projects are Agua Vermelha on the Rio Grande to
be built by CESP  ith a final capacity of 1,380 M4W, and Itunbiara on the
Paranaiba to be built by FURNAS with final capacity of 2,080 MW; this second
project is in effect an integration of three projects originally proposed by
CANAYBRA (paragraph 4.05). In view of the above and the fact that no other
hydroelectric project in the Region could be developed in time to meet require-
ments, the two above mentioned projects were compared with equivalent oil-
fired thermal or nuclear stations, combined with additional hydroelectric peaking
capacity which could be installed at existing hydroelectric plants.
5.014     Annex 9 describes the six alternative programs and the basic assumptions
used in the determination of the least-cost solution and Annex 11 is a graph
of the present worth of the cost differentials (using Itumbiara/Agua Vermelha
as reference) of the other five alternative programs plotted against discount
rates.  This graph shows that the least-cost solution to expand the Regionts
gener rting capacity  orresponds to the programs which include Itumbiara (as
corpared to those whe-_  Ituirbiara is replaced by conventional thermal or
nuclear plants) for all discount rates up to 15%.  Annex 12 shows the effect
of the fuel price on the equalizing discount rate of the alternatives involving
conventional their3al stations.

Return on Project Investment
5.05      For the determination of benefits of Ituibiara, it was assumed that
the economic value of the electricity supplied is at least equal to the value
paid, by the ultimate consumer, i.e. the tariff charge plus the sole tax
(Annex 2).  As shown in Annex 13, the return on the Itumbiara project investment
is 22.9%.

6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Summary
6.01      FURNASt financial performance, past and present, is satisfactory
anc. its outlook is equally satisfactory. This is due to good management
(Daragraph 3.04), a reasonable tariff policy (paragraph 2.13) and the
`ility to borrow substantial amounts from ELETROBRAS (paragraphs 6.08 and
6.11).
Past and Present Financial Performance
6.02      Annexes 14 to 19 contain FURNAS' financial projections through 1982.
In the period 1971-72, FURNAS earned 10% on its investment and after servicing
debt and paying a 10% annual cash dividend contributed about 14% of its invest-
ment program from internal cash generation; the remainder was provided 44% by
ELETROBRAS as share capital and loans, and 42% by foreign borrowings. In that
period, FURNAS' debt service was covered 1.8 times by its internal cash genera-
tion and at the end of 1972 its debt was the equivalent of 63.1% of its total
fixed assets.
1973-82 Financing Plan

6.04      FURNAS' substantial gross internal cash generation is premised
on a rate of return of 12% on remunerable investments; the debt service
resulting from its proposed financial plan would be covered more than 1.5
times by internal cash generation in any year during the period 1973-82; and
a 12% cash dividend would be paid each year. Thus in the period 1973-82,
net internal cash generation would finance about 20% of FURNAS' construction
program and working capital increase.  The remainder would be covered by the
proposed Bank loan 7%, previous Bank loans 14%, other foreign borrowings 20%,
local borrowings from ELETROBRAS 32% - of which eventually about
half would be converted into share capital - and Federal Government contribu-
tion 2%.
6.05      It is assumed the proposed Bank loan of US$125 million would be
made to FURNAS at 7-1/4% interest for thirty years, including a seven-year grace
period. The proposed life of the loan is consistent with the two most recent
loans for hydroelectric power projects in Brazil. The Bank loan would be
guaranteed by the Brazilian Government.
6.o6      Previous Bank loans - 403/474-BR, 565-BR and 677-BR - would provide
a total of about US$80 million in connection with the Estreito, Porto Colombia
and Marimbondo projects which are in progress (paragraph 1.04).
6.07      Foreign borrowings other than from the Bank would include:
(a)  From existing loans:
(i)  Joint financing for the Marimbondo project, about US$23
million for a term of 15 years, including 5 years of
grace, at about 7-1/2% interest;
(ii)  AID loans for the Santa Cruz thermal plant and the Furnas-
Guanabara transmission projects about US$9 million for a term
of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at 6% interest;
(iii)  Eximbank loans for the Angra nuclear project, about US$123
million for a term of 20 years and US$7 million for a term
of 10 years, both including 5 years of grace, at 7% interest;
and,
(b)  From proposed new loans:
(i)  Parallel financing in connection with the Itumbiara Project
amounting to about US$76 million for an assumed term of 15
yearsp including 5 years of grace, at about 7-1/2% interest;
FURNAS has been in touch with various interested countries
and has received letters of interest from a sufficient number
of countries to assure not only the financing success of this
operation but also the desired competition; and
(ii)  Other foreign borrowings amounting to US$278 million for
projects schedulled to start in 1975, but the bulk of which
would only be needed from 1978 onwards. These borrowings
are expected to be for periods of between 15 and 20 years,
including a grace period of 5 years, at interest of 7 - 7-1/4%.



- 20 -
6.o8      Local borrowings would comprise:
(a) Existing loans from ELETROBRAS:
(i) About US$94 million for terms of 15, 20 and 25 years,
including 5 years of grace, at rates of interest
varying between 8% and 11% and subject to monetary
correction; and,
(b) New loans from ZLETROBRAS:
(i) About US$570 million for terms of 15 and 20 years, including
5 years of grace, at 11% interest and subject to monetary
correction (see paragraph 6.11).
6.09      The Federal Government is expected to make a contribution of about
US$34 million towards the construction cost of the nuclear plant for which
capital expenditures of about US$220 million are scheduled in the period
1973-77.
6.10      In line with the most recelnt loan it received from the Bank,
FURNAS agreed during negotiations that it will not incur debt if by such
incurrence its debt would exceed 66-2/3% of its total fixed assets; FURNAS
also agreed not to incur debt with an original term of less than 10 years
if by so doing the total outstanding principal of such debt would exceed
5% of its total fixed assets.
6.1i      In order for FURNAS to carry out its borrowing plan and meet the
debt limitation covenant proposed in paragraph 6.10, some of the loans obtained
from ELETROBRAS (paragraph 6.08) would be converted as required into share
capital. It is estimated that for this purpose about US$282 million of
loans from BLETROBRAS would be converted into share capital in the period
1973-82.
6.12      FURNAS' financing plan as detailed above is reasonable, particularly
with the support of the Federal Government through ELETROBRAS (paragraphs 6.08
and 6.11). During negotiations, the Government agreed that in the event there
should arise reasons to believe FURNAS will not have sufficient funds to
assure the timely completion of the project, it will provide them, either
directly or through ELETROBRAS.
Future Financial Situation
6.13      FURNAS' financial outlook is satisfactory; it depends on its ability
to continue to manage its affairs efficiently, on the maintenance of adequate
tariff legislation and on its access to the sector funds administered by
ELETEOBRAS.
6.14      FURNAS' financial projections, Annexes 14 to 16, show that in the
period 1973-82 sales of energy are expected to grow at a compound average
annual rate of 13.8% and, on the basis of current legislation, a 12% return
on investment has been assumed in these projections. Operating expenses,
which are automatically covered by existing tariff regulations, have been



- 21 -
estimated on the basis of FURNAS' experience and, in view of this and the
Brazilian monetary correction system, no provision has been made for
inflationary increases. In any of the years 1973-82, FURNAS' debt service
on an annual basis would be covered 1.5 times or more by internal cash
generation and at the end of that period its debt would amount to about
60.6% of its total fixed assets.
Audit
6.15      FURNAS' annual financial statements have been certified by
Arthlur Andersen and Company. Their work appears satisfactory. During
negotiations FURNAS agreed to continue to appoint independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank and to submit audited financial statements and
the auditor's report within four months of the year end, each year for
t'ne duration of the loan.



- 22 -
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations,
(a) FURNAS agreed:
(i)  to take all necessary action to have its electricity
tariffs set at levels which will produce revenues
provided for by the legislation of the Guarantor, and
sufficient to ensure FURNAS' continued operation in
accordance with sound financial and public utility
practices. As permitted under the legislation, the
tariffs should be based on assets revalued at least
once every calendar year (paragraph 2.15);
(ii) not to carry out any major programs of expansion of
its generation and transmission facilities without
giving the Bank evidence that such expansion is in
accord with the Southeast Region and South Region
Generation and Major Transmission Development Plans
for such facilities and that adequate financial re-
sources are available. For this purpose, a major
expansion is one the cost of which exceeds 2% of the
gross fixed assets in operation plus work in progress
(paragraph 3.08);
(iii) to retain engineering consultants and contractors
satisfactory to the Bank on terms and conditions
acceptable to it (paragraph 4.08);
(iv) to prepare detailed plans for the resettlement of
the population now living in the areas which will
be flooded in a manner that will not lower its present
living conditions, to furnish such plans for Bank
approval no later than June 30, 1974, and to implement
the resettlement plan in a manner satisfactory to the
Bank (paragraph 4.1h);
(v)  not to incur debt without the Bank's concurrence if
by such incurrence its debt would exceed 66-2/3% of
its total fixed assets; and not to incur debt with an
original term of less than 10 years if by so doing the
total outstanding principal of such debt would exceed
5% of its total fixed assets (paragraph 6.10); and,
(vi) to retain independent auditors satisfactory to the
Bank and to submit audited financial statements and
the auditor's report within four months of the year end
each year for the duration of the loan (paragraph 6.15).



- 23 -
(b) The Federal Government agreed:
(i) to complete the Southeast Region and South Region
Generation and Major Transmission Development Plans
and to transmit them to the Bank for corment no
later than November 1, 1973, for the plans covering
the period 1973-81 and no later than November 1, 1974,
for the period 1982-1990; communicate to the Bank any
proposed significant change to these plans; and give
the Bank an opportunity to comment on a proposed change
before it is adopted (paragraph 2.12);
(ii)  that any change in its legislation which, in the
opinion of the Bank, would adversely affect the Borrower's
financial position would be an event of default
(paragraph 2.15);
(iii) to give due consideration to the recommendations of
the Itumbiara Environmental Impact Reconnaissance Report
of November 1972 (paragraph 4.15); and,
(iv) that in the event there arises reason to believe
FURNAS will not have sufficient funds to assure the
timely completion of the project, the Government
will provide them (paragraph 6.12).
7.02      The project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$125
million equivalent, for a term of 30 years, including a 7-year grace
period.

Article 5  -  Establishes that the above mentioned subsidiaries, will contract
with ITAIPU the purchase of the power and energy for a period
of 20 (twenty) years, as established in Attachment C to the
Treaty. For purposes of planning, generating and transmission
facilities, and of carrying out the proration set forth in
Art. 10, the division of ITAIPU power between FURNAS and
ELETROSUL will be estimated on the basis of 1972 power markets
in the areas where said companies operate.
Article 6  - Establishes that FURNAS and ELETROSUL will build and operate
the EHV transmission system from ITAIPU to their respective
systems, and also the extensions in their existing transmission
systems, as required to deliver ITAIPU power to the Southeast
and South markets, including the EHV terminals and rings to
deliver tha power to metropolitan areas. Part of the financial
resources for this construction will come from the Compulsory
Loan (Law No. 5824, Art. 2).
Article 7  -  Sets up a period of 30 days after the signature of the contracts
mentioned in Art. 5, for the following utilities to sign
20 (twenty) year contracts with FURNAS for the entire power and
energy supply contracted by FURNAS with ITAIPU: CESPs CEMIG,
LIGHT, ESCELSA, CBEE, CELF, CEB, CELG and CEMAT; and establishes

amounts contracted by the other utilities.
Article 10 - Sets up a period of 60 days after the Treaty mentioned in Art. 3
comes into force, for the above mentioned utilities to sign
covenants with FURNAS and ELETROSUL regulating the contemplated
power supplies.
In these covenants the energy will be divided in proportion to
the energy sold in 1972 by each utility, to its consumers, or to
other utilities except those mentioned in Art. 7 and 8. The
amounts of contracted power and energy will be revised when the
actual contracts are signed (two years before ITAIPU operation
as p:c1ided in Attachment C to the Treaty).



ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 3 pages
Article 11 - Establishes that the amounts of power contracted as per Art. 7
and 8 will be in addition to the highest amount of power supplied
by FURNAS and ELETROSUL to each utility, in accordance with
existing or future contracts in force by the date of ITAIPU's
initial operation.
Article 12 -  Establishes that Coordination Groups for Interconnected Operation
will be responsible in the Southeast and South Regions for the
coordination of system operation. These Groups will be organized

ITUNMBIARA HYDROELECTRIC POWJER PROJECT
FURNAS - CENTRAIS ELEUTRICAS, S.A.
BRAZIL
ELECTRICITY TARIFFS IN BRAZIL
1.        Regulations governing tariffs are contained in the Water Code of
1934, subsequent amendments and decrees dated February 26, 1957, and
November 4, 1964, and Laws 5,073 enacted on August 18, 1966 and 5,655 of
May 20, 1971 (effective January 1, 1972).
2.        Prior to 1964, tariffs were based on the use of the historic
value of investment, consequently not reflecting the substantial inflation
which occurred in Brazil. The 1964 decree allowed utilities to revalue
their investment in order to reflect changes in price levels; the 1966
legislation made annual revaluation of assets mandatory.
3.        Under the existing regulations, tariffs are reviewed and approved
by the Department of Water and Power of the Ministry of Mines and Energy
every three years or at shorter intervals at the initiative of tI>e utility.
Without advance approval of that Department, between tariff revisions, the
utilities may add surcharges to current tariffs to cover compulsory
increases in wages, social benefits, costs of fuel and purchased power, and
increases in foreign debt service due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
4.        Tariff adjustments on account of revaluation of balance sheet
accounts are actually obtained by FURNAS as often as the Government calculates
and publishes economic correction factors (coefficients) which reflect
variations in the price level. The coefficients are issued annually about
one month after the end of each year for the use of industry in general
as well as the electric utilities. The coefficients are applied by the
utilities to update the values of plant in service and work in progress,
depreciation and amortization or reversion reserves, if any, and certain
local currency loans of ELETROBRAS and the National Development Bank.
5.        Law 5,655 of May 20, 1971, introduced various changes in the
Brazilian tariff legislation which have an impact on the utilities'
finances, though not altering the legislation's basic philosophy. To
show whiich changes have been made, the following explanation on the matter
of electricity tariffs is given by comparing the situation before and
after January 1, 1972, the date the new law came into force;



ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 4 pages
Applicable before         Applicable after
January 1, 1972           January 1, 1972
Tariffs should be set at levels
so as to provide for the following
items:
(i) Cost of operation, main-
tenance and administration   Applicable                  Applicable
(ii)  Depreciation                  Straight-line up to       Unchanged
5% for thermal in-
stallations and up
to 3% for hydro
installations
(iii)  Income Tax-/                  17% on income below        For the period
12% return, 30%           1972-1975 not
on income above           included in tariff
12% return                applications
(iv) Amortization or
reversio M                 Either up to 5%           Up to 3% for
of total fixed            reversion only
assets in operation
for amortization or
up to 3% on the same
base for reversion
l/  Income Tax - During the period 1972-1975, income is taxed at a rate
of 6%. Utilities are not permitted to include income tax as an
expense in the tariff applications. In its financial projections,
FURNAS has assumed that the rules which applied until the end of 1971 would
be reinstated after 1975.
2/  Amortization or Reversion - Up to January 1, 1972, electric utilities
had the choice of charging either rTamortizationlt (this has no connection
with debt amortization) of up to 5% of total fixed assets in operation,
or "reversion" of up to 3% on the same base. The advantage of charging
amortization was that the utilities could keep the funds derived from
such charges, whereas proceeds from reversion had to be paid to the
Government and could be borrowed back by the electric utilities.
Starting January 1, 1972, "amortization" was abolished and henceforth
reversion must be charged. FURNAS uses 3%. In order to increase
the influence of ELETROBRAS in the Brazilian power sector, the
Government has given it the responsibility of independently administering
the reversion fund on its behalf. ELETROBRAS pays the Government
interest at a rate of 3% for the fund, and lends money out of the fund
to power utilities at a rate of 10%.  At its discretion, ELETROBRAS can also
use up to 5% of the fund to indemnify owners of land flooded by reservoirs.

The above-mentioned items normally are included in the power utilities'
tariff applications and, with the exception of reversion, after January 1, 1972,

consumers pay for three additional charges, which the utilities collect and
turn over to the Government. These charges are as follows:
(i)   Emprestimo compulsorioV/      Currently collected from industrial
(compulsory loan)          consumers at a rate of 35% of
the electricity bill. Thi-s compulsory
loan will be collected until 1983 with
rates gradually going down from 35% in
1973 to 10% in 1983.
Remunerable Assets - The remunerable assets, on whlch the rate of
return under Brazilian legislation is calculated, consist of the
following:
Total fixed assets in operation at the end of the year
Add:  Allowances for working capital
(a)  Cash at the end of the year up to a maximum of the
depreciation reserve.
(b)  Inventories as approved by the tax authorities
(presently up to a maximum of 3% of gross fixed assets
in operation).
(c)  Receivables up to a maximum of two months' billing.
Deduct:
(a)  Depreciation reserve at the end of the year.
(b)  Consumers  or other contributions.
(c)  Various small items specified by law.
2/  Emprestimo Compulsorio (Compulsory Loan) - Revenues from the compulsory
loan, for which customers receive 20-year obligations at 6% interest,
are administered by ELETROBRAS, which invests them in power utilities
either in the form of shares or loans at 13% interest.  Proceeds from this
loan will be allotted by ELETROBRAS, 50% for the construction of hydro-
electric power plants in the Parana river basin; 15% for the construction
of hydroelectric power plants in the Sao Francisco river basin; 10% to be
invested in the capital stock of LETRTWORTE, a new company to be
constituted for the purpose of coordinating the electric power program in
the Amazon region; and 25% for thie construction of regional transmission
systems in extra high voltage and the execution of a national pioneering
program of nuclear power plants.

risks:  damages to fusillage, accident liability for passengers
and crew, civil liability.
2.8  Civil Liability - Visitors
The purpose of this insurance is to pretect FURNAS, to the maximum
limit of the amount insured, in the event of its having to pay
indemnities, due to legal court order or by virtue of agreements
approved by the insurer, for bodily h1amu or disease (including
death resulting therefrom), and for material damages involuntarily
caused to third parties by accidents, and due to such third parties'
visit to FURNAS properties.
2.9  Civil Liability for Constructicn and Srection Operations
(Under Study)
The above insurance is against damages to third parties caused by
construction and erection operations for the Angra Nuclear Power
Plant.
3. In view of the fact that FUINAS is a mixed-economy company, all its
insurance, with the exception of Group Life InsurAnce and Personal Accident
Insurance, is distributed among the larger Brazilian insurance companies
by the Instituto de Resseguros do Brasil (Reinsurance Institute of Brazil)
by means of lottery.
4. Some of the company's properties, althoughi valuable, are not insured,
since by experience it is preferable for it to be "self-insured". Thus,

POWER AND ENERGY BALANCE OF THE SOUTHEAST REGION
1.        ELETROBRAS presented to the Bank in December 1972 a document called
"Revisao do Balan9o Energetico 1971-19851" which compares the Southeast power
and energy requirements with the present available generating capacity and
that of the plants under construction or proposed; it presents the program
for generation expansion which is shown in table on page 3 of this annex.
In this program, besides the proposed schemes of Agua Vermelha and Itumbiara,
which are assumed to be in full operation by 1981, four units of the 2,000 MW
Itaipu (Sete Quedas) scheme in the Parana River, are supposed to be installed
by 1982, to be able to meet the power and energy requirements of the Region
at that date.
2.        The table on page 3 shows the actual and forecast power and energy
balance of the Region for the period 1969-1982. In order to determine the
available energy from the existing and proposed generating plants, ELETROBRAS
made a series of simulation studies in which the hydrological information
corresponding to the driest 42 months (the critical period) of historic
statistical data was used as a criterion for determining the available capacity.
Two types of studies have been carried out for this purpose: the so-called
"static energy balance" of the system, by means of which the total firm energy
is assumed to be the sum of the average generation available of each plant dur-
ing critical period and the so-called "dynamic energy balance"? where the avail-
able generation is determined by simulating the operation of the system based
on real-time conditions, under which the available energy of the whole system
would depend upon the assumed starting conditions, such as actual reservoir
levels, actual avaLlability of generating units, etc.  The first method has
been used for determining the long-range behavior of the generating system;
the second method, although less conservative than the first, gives a more
accurate answer to the question of the system energy availability in the next
coming years and makes it possible to revise the results as changes take place
in the program implementation. In this way consideration may be given to de-
lays in the commissioning of generating units and other circumstantial factors,
such as the effect on the system availability of the first filling of the
reservoirs, which reduce the energy generation of the down-stream plants, etc.
3.        As shown in the table of page 3, the Region's energy requirements
are adequately covered by the proposed generating expansion program up to
1979; starting in 1979, the Region's available peaking capacity does not provide
the required 12% reserve capacity to the system. The second phase of the Region
planning study, as explained in paragraph 2.11 should determine the necessary
peaking capacity expansion to cover this deficit.

FURNAS - CENTRAIS ELETRICAS, S.A.
BRAZIL
LEAST COST SOLUTION
1.        For the reasons explained in paragraph 5.03, the economic justi-
fication of the Project was done by comparing the cost of the following
alternatives to provide the electricity supply of the Southeast Region:
Alternative A: (basic alternative) Itumbiara and Agua Vermelha form
part of the generation expansion program.
Alternative B:  Similar to Alternative A but Itumbiara is replaced by
an oil-fired thermal plant (thermal station) and
additional hydro peaking capacity.
Alternative C: Similar to alternative A but Itumbiara is replaced by
a nuclear station and additional hydro peaking capacity.
In order to measure the relative merits of the two new hydro schemes contem-
plated in the expansion program: Itumbiara and Agua Vermelha, the following
alternatives were also studied:
Alternative D: Agua Vermelha is replaced by a thermal station and
additional hydro peaking capacity.
Alternative E: Itumbiara and Agua Vermelha are replaced by thermal
stations and additional hydro peaking capacity.
Alternative F:  Similar to alternative E but, the thermal stations are
replaced by nuclear stations.
2.        The study made by ELETROBRAS for this purpose was revised by the Bank;
in this revised study, the alternatives were compared by determining the Present
Worth at year 1972 of their total cost (investment, operation and maintenance),
for annual discount rates of 9-14%. The time horizon was extended to 56 years
under the assumption that the investment components would be replaced by others
of the same cost at the end of their useful life and that the annual operating
and maintenance costs would become constant after the installations reached
full utilization.
3.        Taxes and import duties were excluded from the cost.  Labor and foreign
exchange costs were analyzed in the context of their macroeconomic value. As no
unemployment apparently prevails at the construction sites for skilled or semi-
skilled workers (no significant numbercf unskilled workers are employed  in this
type of work), the labor cost component was calculated at actual salaries. On

the other hand, as the cruziero value in relation to foreign currencies has
been readjusted periodically in accordance with indexes reflecting its
purchasing power, the imported goods and services should be evaluated at
the current rates of exchange, but a 20% increase was considered necessary
in view of the elimination of import duties in the cost evaluation. The
above method leads to conservative results, as it disfavors the proposed
hydro schemes.
4.        In order to compare the alternatives under consideration, the
required respective hydro peaking supplementary plants were determined; this
was done by applying to the system, for each alterxnative, the following
conditions: (i) equal firm energy, and (ii) equal peaking capacity. A
separate study was done to determine the optimum average plant factor for
the non-hydro alternatives: plant factor of 73% for the thermal stations
and 85% for the nuclear stations were obtained, the latter being the maximum
availability factor dccepted for these type of stations. The supplementary
hydro peaking capacity to mte'. condition (ii) was assumed to be provided by
expanding the generating capacity of hydro plants now in operation, some of
which present favorable conditions for this purpose. The table below shows
the equivalent capacity of the conventional thermal and nuclear stations
plus hydro peaking stations that were used for the comparisons:
Itumbiara        Agua Vermelha
Gross capacity (MW)                             2,080              1,380
Net capacity (MW)                               1,976              1,311
Annual firm energy (Av MW)                      1,030                680
Equivalent Thermal Alternative
Thermal capacity (MW)                        1,500              1,000
Hydro peaking capacity (MW)                    593                400
Equivalent Nuclear Alternative
Nuclear capacity (MW)                        1,200                800
Hydro peaking (MW)                             802                537
5.        Commercial size units of 500 MW for the thermal stations and 800,
1,000 and 1,200 MW for the nuclear stations were adopted. All the non-hydro
stations were assumed to be located in the neighoornood of the main load
centers delivering their power to the closest 500 kV substation.
6.        The basic data used in the study are shown in AnnexlO. The power
cost for the alternatives involving conventional thermal plants was
calculated at an international fuel oil price level of US$17.9/ton
(US$2.72/barrel), which is 20% higher than the prices prevailing at the
beginning of 1972, in view of the strong tendency for world fuel prices to
rise relative to the other cost inputs by the time these plants would be in
oper -'ion. The price at plant site, considering freight and local handling
was estimated at US$23.60/ton.

7.        The results of the study are shown in graph of Annex 21 where
the Present Worth of the power cost differential of the five alternatives
in relation to the proposed program is plotted against discount rates. It
can be seen that all the alternatives considered in the cost comparison for
the power expansion program of the Southeast region have higher costs than
the proposed program (Alternative A) for discount rates higher than the
country's estimated opportunity cost of capital. The replacement of
Itumbiara by a conventional thermal plant (Curve E) would be economical
only for discount rates higher than 15%, which emphasizes the merits of
the project.
8.        For the basic parameters adopted in the study, nuclear stations
only become more attractive than the thermal stations for discount rates
below the estimated opportunity cost of capital.
9.        Graph of Annex 12 shows the effect of the fuel prices on the
equalizing discount rate of the alternatives involving thermal stations.

RETURN ON PROJECT INVESTMENT
1.        If 12% of Itumbiara's installed capacity is considered as system's
reserve, and taking into account the energy generated at Itumbiara and at
the downstream plants due to its regulating effect, the equivalent plant
factor of this project is of the same order as the Region's load factor.
In view of the above, the return calculation has been based on the costs
related to Itumbiara alone and benefits related to the consumption of the
aforesaid energy.
2.        It has been assumed that the benefits derived from the electricity
supply can be valuated at least at the unit value paid for by the utili-
mate consumer- which in this case is the tariff charge plus the sole tax (see
Annex 2).  Based on the above an average benefit of CR 0.176/kWh sold, was
estimated.
3.        The cost was determined by computing Itumbiara generating and trans-
mission cost plus the correspondent incremental distribution system cost. The
losses of the agricultural production caused by the Itumbiara reservoir were not
considered as an additional cost of the project (negative benefit) because the
cost of land and resettlement included in the investment cost estimate exceeds
the value of said losses. On the other hand, no benefits other than the power
supplied were considered.
4.        The basic assumptions made for the return determination were similar
to those made for the least-cost solution comparison (see Annex 9). Detailed
calculations are shown in table of pages 2, 3 and 4. The estimated return on
Itumbiara project investment and associated distribution facilities, determin-
ed by the above described method resulted in 23.5 , which can be considered
far beyond the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Brazil.

CONVERSION OF FOREIGN COSTS INTO LOCAL CURRENCY
1.        In Brazil, the financial performance of  a  power company depends
to a large extent on the mechanism prescribed by law for converting the
cost of foreign inputs into local currency and, thereafter, for adjusting
the value of these - and of the local inputs - by monetary correction co-
efficients which are meant to maintain the value of fixed assets on a real
rather than on a current price basis.
2.        For electric power companies, the law states that the conversion
of the value of imported goods into local currency will be made as follows:
(a)  during the grace period, if any, at the rate of exchange in
force for remittance abroad on the date of the contract; and
(b) after the grace period, at the rate of exchange in. force at
the time of the first payment abroad.
3.        From the above it follows that FURNAS, Which has several projects
in progress, uses several different rates of exchange to record the value
of its assets. This is very important because the allowable rate of return
is calculated on the amount of fixed assets thus valued.
4.        In the financial projections presented in annexes 10 to 15,
foreign costs have been converted into the local currency at the following
rates of exchange:
(a)  Fiscal year 1971 at Cr$4 95 per US$1;
(b) Fiscal years 1972 through 1982 for all transactions other
than construction costs and related debt, depreciation, a-
mortization and interest at Cr$5.635 per US$1; and
(c) Fiscal years 1972 through 1982 for construction costs and
related debt, depreciation, amortization and interest, as
follows:
- Estreito generation and Brasilia transmission projects
at Cr$6.123 per US$1;
- Porto Colombia plant and transmission project at
Cr$6.106 per US$1;
- Furnas generation and Marimbondo plant and transmission
projects at Cr$5.953 per US$1;
-  Santa Cruz plant, stage II, the Angra plant, the Itum-
biara plant and transmission, and other generation and
transmission projects at Cr$5.635 per US$1.
