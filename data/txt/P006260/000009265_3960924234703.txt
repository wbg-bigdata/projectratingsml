ITUMBIARA HYDROELBCTRIC POWER PROJECT (923-BR)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Itumbiara
Lydroeleotric Project, which was partially financed with the pr'ceeds of Loan
923-BR (US$125.0 million equivalent). The borrower was Furnas Centrais
Eletricas S.A. (FURNAS). The Bank approved the Loan in August 1973 and
subsequent execution of the ProJect occurred on schedule.
The PCR was prepared by the Energy Division Of the Latin Ameri&a
and Caribbean Regional Office based on the information in Bank files, on
final project data prepared by the borrower, and on discussions with staff of
the Bank and the borrower.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this POR was read by the Operations Evaluations Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by ORD staff.
Following standard procedures, OED has sent copies of the draft
report to the Government and the borrower. The borrower reviewed the PCR and
his editorial comments, Attachment 1, have been incorporated into the report.

BRAZIL
PROJECT COIPLZTION4 REPORT
FURNAS CENTRALS ELETRICAS, S.A. (FURNAS)
IrJMBIARA HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT (LOAN 923-BR)
Highlights
1.        FURNAS executed on schedule the Project and succeeded in obtaining
its primary objective - providing the least-cost solution to meeting
regional demand growth. Through Loan 923-BR, the Bank succeeded in obtaining
supplementary objectives: strengthening integrated planning and operation for
the system; introducing international competition into the ctvil works
industry in Brazil; and maximizing the amount of parallel financing from
bilateral agencies.
2.        During the period 1976-1982, the financial performance of FURNAS
surpassed that of the sector but the financial performance of the sector
declined from its formerly high level in the middle 1970's. This declining
sector performance was the central subject of dialogue between Brazilian
power authorities and the Bank. To address this situation, the Bank and the
Government negotiated in 1981 an agreement on tariff increases for the spctor
which superceded existing revenues _ovenants.  This agreement represented an
easing of revenue targets as compared with those originally covenauted; and
was replaced in 1983 by a new agreement which specified rate-of-remuneration
targets. The Go- rnment complied with the terms of these two agreements.
3.        By holding down tariffs, the Government has weakened the sector
which was adversely affected by recession and successive devaluation which
occurred in recent years. Despite this development, the Brazilian power
sector continues to be well managed with a better than average performance in
satisfying an extremely rapid market growth and with good investment
planning.



BRAZIL
PURNAS CFNTRAIS ELETRICAS, S.A. (PURNAS)
ITUMBIARA HYQROELftifC PROJECT (LOAN 923-BR)
I. BACKGROUND
1.1   Bank Participation in Sector Financing
1.1.1       Since 1949, the Bank has made 38 loans to the power sector of
Brazil, amounting to USD2.35 billion equivalent. Prior to 1976, most Bank
loans helped to finance the construction of hydroelectric plants and
associated transmission facilities in the Southeastern and Southern regions.
1.1.2       Since 1976, there has been a reorientation of Bank lending to
support distribution projects in all regions of Brazil. In connection with
such projects, the Bank has provided the power sector with eleven loans,
amounting to US$1.37 billion, including six loans to Centrais Eletricas
Brasileiras, S.A. (ELETROBRAS), amounting to US$0.87 billion.
1.1.3       The Bank has made six loans to Furnas Centrais Eletricas, S.A.
(FURNAS) for US$396.3 million (Annex 1.1). The first five loans to FURNAS
helped to finance hydroelectric plants and /or related transmission
facilities forming part of a larger development plan of the Rio Grande
basin. All of the proJects financed by the first five loans to FURNAS were
successfully completed, although with some time and cost overruns.. The
sixth loan (923-BR, US$125.0 million) helped to finance the Itumbiara
hydroelectric project, which is the subject of this report. FURNAS will also
be benefitting from a recently approved loan to ELETROBRAS (2564-BR; US$400
million), which has committed itself to relending US$286.8 million to FURNAS
to help finance high-priority transmission facilities.
1.2   Sector Organization
1.2.1       As a result of progressive nationalization and growing
centralization over the forty years ending in 1974, the Brazilian power
sector evolved into a relatively compact structure of federal and state
utilities. Decree No. 68,024 of June 7, 1967 established the legal,
technical, and administrative structure of the power sector and defined the
structure as consisting of the National Department of Water and Electric
Energy (DNAEE), ELETROBRAS, and the various federal, state, municipal and
private concessionaires, all under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Mines
and Energy (MME).
1.2.2       DNAEE has been performing regulatory functions, including the
granting of licenses for hydroelectric sites, assigning concession areas,
setting tariffs, and approving sector expansion plans. Since 1981, the



-2-
authority of DNAEE to set tariffs and -approve expansion plans has been
reduced by the effective transfer of final authority to the Secretariat of
Planning (SEPLAN), which has been reviewing and approving tariff increases
and investment plans within a broader policy context.
1.2.3       ELETROBRAS, a mixed economy corporation, whose principal
shareholder is the Government of Brazil, has been operating as an
executing agency under the jurisdiction of the MME and In coordination with
DNAEE and SEPLAN.   ELETROBRAS has been performing the functions of: (a)
utility holding company for those power utilities where the Government has
acquired finsnca al control; (b) investment banker by administering public
funds for use by its subsidiaries and by state power companies; and (c)
coordinator of the external borrowing efforts of the individual power
companies. ELETROBRAS has also been carrying out a planning function by
analyzing the expansion plans of major generation and transmission companies;
and an operational co-ordination function through the Co-ordinating Groups
for Interconnected Operations (GCOI's). Operating on a regional basis--one
for the South-southeast and one for the Northeast--the GC0I's are charged
with the responsibility for maximizing economic benefits through the most
efficient operation of interconnected generating plants and transmission
systems.
1.2.4       At the operating level, the sector consists of federal, state,
municipal, and private concessionaires. Since 1974, in accordance with
Government policy, construction and operation of major new power generating
facilities and related high voltage transmission systems are reserved largely
to four ELETROBRAS subsidiaries which cover Brazil's five geo-economic
regions. These companies are FURNAS, Centrais Eletricas do Norte do Brasil
(ELETRONORTE), Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco (CHESF) and Centrais
Eletricas do Sul do Brasil (ELETROSUL). ELETROBRAS also owns the power
distributor for the state of Espirito Santo (Espirito Santo Centrais
Eletricais, S.A.-ESCELSA) and the distribution company serving the
metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro (LIGHT - Servicos de Eletricidade,
S.A.-LIGHT). ELETROBRAS has been investing in distribution companies; but
the distribution function is carried out at the state level mainly by
utilities controlled by stete governments. ELETROBRAS also holds the
Brazilian Government's 50% interest in the Itaipu Binational, the binational
agency established (1973) by the governments of Brazil and Paraguay to build
jointly the 12,600 MW Itaipu hydroelectric facility on the Parana river.
1.3   The Borrower
1.3.1       FURNAS is the largest operating subsidiary of ELETROBRAS,
covering the Southeast and part of the Center-west regions. It generates
energy primarily from hydroplants constructed on the Rio Grande for bulk
delivery to regional electric distributing companies through an extensive
high-voltage transmission system.



-3-
1.3.2       In terms of sales and capacity additions, the growth of FURNAS
has been impressive.  In 1964, PURNAS had an installed capacity of 900 NW and
sold 3,215 GWh. By 1984, FURNAS had an installed capacity of 7,466 MW and
sold 33,375 GWh;.it operated 10,711 km of transmission lines (at 138, 230,
345, 500, and 765 kW) and 30 substations with a total transformation capacity
of P1,000 I4VA.
1.3.3       Of the generation capacity of PURNAS, 6,800 MW is hydroelectric;
and 666 NW is oil-fired power plant. A nuclear power generating plant, Angra
I, with a capacity of 626 MY, started commercial operation on January 17,
1985. As a result of an international agreement between Brazil and Paraguay,
FURNAS is obligated to purchase most (about 85%) of the energy available from
the binational authority operating the hydroelectric plant at Itaipu on the
Parana River. This agreement stipulates that the allocation of the energy
generated at the Itaipu hydroplant will have priority over the allocation of
the energy at the existing plants. As a result, the energy purchases of
FURNAS, mainly from the Itaipu hydroplant, are expected to grov at an average
annual rate of about 61% between 1984 and 1992.
1.3.4       The financial planning, budgeting, and reporting systems of
FTURNAS are satisfactory. Also satisfactory are the accounting and billing
systems and the internal audit group.

IL.  PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1   Project Origin and Rationale
2.1.1       In 1963-1965, a consortium of Canadian, American, and Brazilian
(CANAMBRA) engineering firms identified a series of low-cost hydroelectric
sites, including Itumbiara, which would be part of an economic development
sequence for meeting the anticipated growth of electricity in the
Southeastern region up to 1980. The United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) funded the CANAMBRA study; the Bank acted as Executing Agency.
Brazilln power authorities followed the recommendations of the CANAMBRA
study, including the decision (taken in about 1971) to construct Itumbiara
(about 1971), in developing the power potential of the Southeastern and
South-Central regions. -
2.1.2       According to the CANAMBRA study, the Itumbiara site, located on
the Paranaiba River, about 1,200 km northwest of Rio de Janeiro, was suitable
for development in conjunction wit;h two other sites, Tupaciguara and
Anhanguera. With the assistance of the Brazilian branch of an international
engineering firm, FURNAS performed detailed computer studies of the Itumbiara
dam height. As a result of these studies, FURNAS took the decision to
increase substantially the height of the dam, thereby eliminating the other
two planned upstream dams, while increasing the storage capacity of the
Itumbiara reservoir four-fold. The decision to increase the height of the
dam made possible the installation at Itumbiara of twice the capacity
originally envisaged by CANAMBRA.
2.1.3       In June 1972, FURNAS authorities provided Bank staff with cost
estimates on the expanded Itumbiara hydroelectric project. In addition to
normal economic and technical considerations, the Bank was interested in
using the proposed loan (US$125.0.0 million) as a means to: (i) strengthen
the position of ELETROBRAS in the power sector by committing the Government
to integrated planning and operation of the power sector; (ii) expose local
civil works contractors to-international competitive bidding (ICB); and
(iii) maximize the amount of parallel foreign financing compatible with the
requirements of FURNAS.
2.2   Project Definition and Cost
2.2.1       Bank preparation and appraisal missions (October 1972; January
and May 1973) found ti-. Itumbiara project to be suitable for Bank lending.
The proposed Project wou A consist of the following components:
(a)  The main dam 7 km long compri4,tng:
(i)  concrete spillway, intake and transition sections involving 2.3
million m3 of concrete work; and



-5-
(ii) earth-fill embankment sections on both banks, involving 30
million m3 of fill, with a maximum height of 106 m;
(b)   a conventional indoor type power station with exght generating units
rated at 260 KW each.
(c)   single-oircuit 500 kY transmission lines (496 km); a single-circuit
345 kV line to Brasilia from Itumbiara (350 km); and expansion of the
138 kV system in Rio de Janeiro and its extension into the State of
Espirito 3anto;
(d)   the corresponding 500 kV, 345 kV-and 138 kY transformer substations;
and
(e'   expansion of the load dispatch and microwave communications systems.
2.2.2     The 500 kV transmission lines would interconneot Itumbiara with the
hydro plants at Sao Simao, Marimbondo, and Agua Vermelha; and would be part
of a common 500 kV network linking the three major regional electricity
producers 1/, whieh had agreed that power delivered from the above plants
would be transmitted in any di-ation on their respective portions of the
common network without wheeling charges. The common network would have the
minimum capital cost of the various alternatives oonsidered.
2.2.3     The transmission lines at 138 kV consisted of: (i) 150 km of double
cirouit interconnecting the Santa Cruz thermal plant with the Angra nuclear
plant and the area of Parati; and (ii) 370 km of double oircuit
interconnecting Adrianopolie in the Rio area with Cachoeiro do Itapemirim in
the state of Espirito Santo.
2.2.4     The proposed dam and hydroelectric station were expected to cost
US$439.7 million (foreign cost: US$170.5 million). The proposed transmission
system was expeoted to cost US$1,3.5 million (foreign cost: US$49.0
million). The total cost of the Projeet was expected to amount to US$593.2
million. Proposed sources of finanoing included: the loan from the
Bank -- US$125.0 million; parallel financing from bilateral agencies --
US$76-0 million; and funding from FURNAS (internal cash generation) and
ELETROBRAS (equity contributions and loans) -- US$392.2 million.
2.3   Project Preparation and Appraisal
2.3.1     In addition to defining the cost and components of the proposed
Projeet, Bank preparation and appraisal missions focused on such issues as
the identification of project items suitable for Bank financing and suitable
for parallel financing, the economic justifioation of the Project, the effeot
of geological unknowns on the cost of the dam, and environmental aspeets of
the Project. Eventually, Bank staff and Braziliaa power authorities found
solutions to these issues.
1/ -FURNAS, Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais (CEMIG), and Centrais
Bletricas de Sao Paulo (CESP).



-6-
2.3.2     In connection with the identification of items suitable for Bank
financing, and in line with its project objectives (para. 2.1.3), the Bank
decided to provide a loan of US$125 million to finance: (a) part of the
foreign cost component (up to US$60.0 million) of the civil works for the dam
and hydro electric station; and (b) a list of equipment (about US$65.0
million), mostly transmission, not suitable for financing through parallel
financing arrangements   The contracts benefitting from Bank financing would
be subject to ICB. Disbursements from the proposed Bank loan for civil works
contracts would be made against 35X of the amount billed up to US$60.0
million. Disbursements for the Bank loan for the equipment contracts would
be for 100% of the amount billed up to US$65.0 million. It was expected that
the equipment financed under parallel financing arrangements (US$76.0
million) would be subject to ICB, the Brazilian manufacturers being given the
same 15% margin of preference as under the Bank loans. It was also expected
that the equipment obtained by parallel financing arrangements would consist
of such items as the main generating equipment, power transformers, etc.,
which were not manufactured or priced competitively in Brazil. FURNAS
successfully completed arrangements for parallel financing.
2.3.3     In connection with the economic justification of the Project, the
Bank agreed on an exception basis to certain 'simplified' economic tests --
namely, the comparison of the proposed hydro project with an equivalent
oil-fired thermal plant or nuclear station combined with additional
hydroelectric peaking capacity to be installed at existing hydroelectric
plants. As compared with five alternative programs, the proposed Itumbiara
project was found to be the least-cost solution for all discount rates up to
15X.
2.3.4     Bank agreement to accept the "simplified' economic tests occurred
because ELETROBRAS did not provide a least-cost regional justification for
the Itumbiara Project. Such a justification had been expected, as the
Government had committed itself under the Guarantee Agreement (Section 3.03)
for the Sao Simao Project (Loan 829-BR) to "...adopt the South Central Region
Generation Development Plan...as the basis for granting concessions for, and
authorizing investments in, generation facilities in the South Central
Region". Instead of providing the expected justification, ELETROBRAS
presented an energy balance study which merely verified that the-
non-integrated, individual expansion plans of FURNAS, CEMIG and CESP would
meet the energy requirements of the region for the period 1972-1985. To
reinforce the commitment of the Government to seek least-cost regione.l
solutions, the Bank, during negotiations, persuaded the Government to prepare
a proper development plan for both generation and transmission expansion by
November 1, 1983.
2.3.5     Because of incomplete geological investigation.s, the cost of
foundation excavation for the clay embankments represented a major unknown.
Except for the concrete spillway and powerhouse intake, which were founded on
good rock, the geology of the dam site, especially the geology underlying the



7-
proposed embankments, consisted of highly compressible over-burden which was
suspected of varying from 2 meters to aDre than 30 meters. To prepare a
foundation, removal of the over-burden would be necessary; but the full
extent of excavation and its associated cost were significant uncertainties.
To compensate for the unknowns of excavation, the Bank added a physical
contingency allowance of 20X to the original cost of the civil works; but did
not fully explain the basis for such a contingency level. It was recognized
implicitly by Bank staff that the cost of the Project would probably be
subject to upward revision as more information became available on the
geology of the dam site.
2.3.6     At the suggestion of the Bank, a consultant studied the
environmental aspects of the Project. Because of the remoteness of the
Project site and the low population density in the vicinity, the consultant
found that the impact of the Project would be relatively small. During
negotiations, FURNAS agreed to provide the Bank by June 30, 1974 a
satisfactory resettlement plan for the population displaced by the
Project; and to implement such plan in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
2.4 Negotiations, Board Approval, Loan Signing and Effectiveness
2.4.1     No major problems delayed negotiations (May 21-23, 1973), Board
approval (July 5, 1973), loan signing (August 1, 1973), or effectiveness of
the Loan Agreement (October 30, 1973). Loan 923-BR amounted to US$125.0
million; the term was 30 years, including a grace period of seven years. The
interest rate was 7.25% per year; the commitment fee, 3/4 of 1X.
2.5 Ma;or Covenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
2.5.1     Annex 2.1 sets forth major covenants of the Loan and Guarantee
Agreements. With respect to the Itumbiara Loan, FURNAS and Government
authorities complied with their respective major covenants including those
in the areas of tariffs and revenues.

III* PROJECT EXECUTION AND COST
3.1   Actual and Forecast Data on Project Execution and Cost
3.1.1       The Project had two major parts:  the dam and hydroelectric
station; and the transmission system. The project also included expansion of
the load dispatch and microwave communications systems. Concerning the dam
and hydroelectric station, Annexes 3.1 and 3.2 set forth actual and forecast
completion dates and data on quanti:ies of material (excavation, concrete,
fill, etc.). With respect to the transmission facilities, Annexes 3.3 and
3.4 set forth actual and forecast completed transmission lines and
substations, together with their corresponding completion dates. Annexs 3.5
and 3.6 compare actual and forecast project costs in current and constant
prices. Annexes 3.7 and 3.8 compare actual and forecast data for allocation
of the proceeds of the loan and cumulative disbursements, respectively.
Annex 3.9 sets forth price deflator indices used to convert cost data from
current-prices into constant prices (May 1973). The following paragraphs
discuss the information contained in the annexes.
3.2   Timetable, Changes, and Supervision
3.2.1       The dam and hydroelectric station were completed on time; actual
quantities of material (excavation, concrete, fill, etc.) were 13% greater
than expected (Annexes 3.1 and 3.2).
3.2.2       The transmission portion of the Project consisted of the
"ttumbiara System" (a network of transmission lines at 500 kV plus
corresponding substations) and reinforcement of the 138 kV transmission lines
in the states of Espirito Santo, plus corresponding substations
(paras. 2.2.1 - .2). Except for deletion of the Sao Simao-Marimbondo line,
to which the Bank agreed, FURNAS completed construction of the lines and
substations of the "Itumbiara System" on time and essentially without major
change. To meet the evolving supply requirements of the system, FURNAS
expanded the substation component beyond that originally foreseen at
appraisal by adding such items as transmission lir.e bays, transformers, and
reactors. The additional items increased the cost of the Project but did not
represent a change to the Project requiring Bank agreement (Annexes 3.3 and
3.4).
3.2.3       In 1974, to take account of changing market demands in the states
of Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo, FURNAS proposed the substitution of two
single-circuit 345 kV lines (Adrianopolis-Rocha Leao-Campos-Cach. do
Itapemiri*-Vitoria) for two double-circuit 138 kV transmission lines
extending only to Cach. do Itapemirim; and the addition of a 138 kV
transmission line between Cach. do Itapemirim and Vitoria. PURNAS also
proposed changes to the corresponding substations. The Bank agreed to these
and later changes proposed by FURNAS. Construction of the transmission



-9-
reinforcement was completed in 1977 and 1978 (Annexes 3.3 and 3.4). As
completed, the scope of the transmission reinforcement was larger than what
was expected at appraisal. FURNAS also completed expansion of its load
dispatch and microwave communications systema.
3.2.4       Bank missions supervised the Project annually between 1974 and
1981. They found no major technical problems requiring special attention on
their part.
3.3   Project Cost
3.3.1     In current prices, the cost of the dam and the hydroelectric
station amounted to US$716.3 million, 62.9% more than the appraisal forecast;
and the cost of the transmission component amounted to US$334.5 million,
117.9% more than the appraisal forecast. The total cost of the Project
amounted to US$1,050.8 million (Annex 3.5), funding for which was provided by
the Bank (US$125.0 million), FURNAS and ELETROBRAS (US$759.1 million),
Brazilian development institutions (US$133.0 million), a Brazilian commercial
bank (US$0.8 million) and foreign commercial banks and bilateral agencies
(US$32.9 million).
3.3.2     In 1973 constant prices, the cost of the dam and the hydroelectric
station amounted to US$483.3 million, 20.3% more than the appraisal
forecast. The cost of the transmission component amounted to US$237.9
million, or 75.6% more than expected at appraisal (Annex 3.6).
3.3.3     With respect to the dam and hydroelectric station, the cost
increase (US$81.6 million), as measured in constant 1979 prices, was
concentrated in local currency purchases and had its origin in the
following: (i) land values were US$15.9 million more than expected because
of the recent (and therefore unexpected) migration of large commercial
farming operations to the vicinity of the Itumbiara reservoir; (ii) civil
works expenditures were US$34.0 million more then expected due, inter alia,
to larger-than-expected quantities of material; (iii) equipment costs were
US$7.9 million more than expected, reflecting the renegotiation of equipment
contracts placed with local manufacturers following Government withdrawal of
fiscal incentives; and (iv) engineering/administration costs were US$23.8
million higher than expected, reflecting, inte, alia, the higher cost of
civil works. However, as a percentage of the total project costs, the cost of
engineering/administration was only slightly larger than the upper end of the
range normal to such costs: 19.3% vs. 18.0%.
3.3.4     With respect to the transmission component, the cost increase
(US$102.4 million), as measured in constant prices, was concentrated in local
currency purchases and had its origin in: (i) the addition of equipment. to
the "Itumbiara Systemw (para. 3.2.2); (ii) expansion of the scope of the
reinforcement of the transmission system in the states of Rio de Janeiro and
Espirito Santo (para. 3.2.3); and (iii) rising equipment costs due to the



- 10 -
renegotiation of contracts following Government withdrawal of fiscal
incentives. The rising equipment costs contradicted appraisal expectations
with respect to the placing of equipment orders outside of Brazil and sources
of financing (pars. 2.3.2).
3.3.5     At appraisal, Bank and-FURNAS staff expected that bilateral
agencies would provide about US$76.0 million under parallel financing
arrangements to fund the cost of equipment, both transmission and generation,
either not manufactured or not sold at competitive prices by national
manufacturers. To encourage bidding by national manufacturers, FURNAS agreed
that equipment would be purchased under ICB with a 15% margin of preference
to be offered to national-manufacturers. The Government also provided fiscal
incentives to local manufacturers. In these circumstances, with local
manufacturers winning a substantial number of contracts and enjoying
financing from Brazilian development institutions, bilateral and Bank
financing for equipment amounted to only US$32.9 million and US$52.1 million,
respectively, as compared with total equipment costs of US$453.6 million (in
current prices).
3.3.6     After the contracts for the supply of equipment were awarded, the
Government withdrew the fiscal incentives, thereby forcing FURNAS and the
national manufacturers to negotiate new contracts at higher prices. If
FURNAS had attempted to enforce the original contract, according to FURNAS
staff, there would have been substantial litigation, resulting in delay to
the Project.
3.4   Allocation of Loan Proceeds and Timing of Disbursements
3.4.1     Changes in the expected pattern of financing (para. 3.3.3),
together with increased costs for civil works of the dam and hydroelectric
station, led FURNAS to seek, and the Bank to agree, to a reallocation of loan pro-
ceeds to finance a larger portion of civil works than expected at appraisal
(Annex 3.7). Initial construction delays led to corresponding delays for
disbursements; but these delays were not serious (Annex 3.8).
3.5   Integrated Planning and Operation of the Power Sector;
Environmental Impact of the Project
3.5.1     The Government equipped ELETROBRAS with the legal authority and
technical capacity to carry out expansion planning for major generation and
transmission companies (pars. 2.1.3). The Bank reviewed and accepted in 1975
the expansion program for the Southern and Southeastern regions. While late
in preparation, this program satisfied the requirements of Section 3.03 of
the Guarantee Agreement. The Bank is satisfied with the planning performance
of ELETROBRAS, which has developed high quality and technically advanced
planning models.
3.5.2     The Bank was satisfied with the performance of FURNAS with respect
to covenanted environmental obligations (Section 3.07 of the Loan
Agreement). FURNAS prepared and executed a resettlement plan for the
population displaced by the formation of the Itumbiara reservoir.

IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
4.1    Actual and Forecast Data on Justification of the Ptoject
4.1.1       Annexes 4.1 and 4.2 compare, respectively, the actual and
forecast energy and power balances for the Southeast resion and the market
forecast of the FURNAS system. Annex 4.3 sets forth the return on actual
Investment in the Itumbiara Project.
4.2    Project and Loan Objectives
4.2.1       The main objective of the Itumbiara project was to provide FURNAS
with the least-cost solution for umeting the expected demand for power in the
Southeastern region. The Bank was interested in using the loan for
supplementary objectives -- namely, to strengthen sector planning and
operations, to introduce; international competition into the national civil
works industry, and to maximize parallel financing from bilateral agencies
(para. 2.1.3). The Project and the loan were successful In meeting their
respective objectives. The Itumbiara hydroelectric project was successfully
executed and is making a significant contributions to the supply of energy
generated by FURNAS. The Itumbiara plant supplied about 26Z of the total
generation of FURNAS in 1983. Brazilian power authorities strengthened
sector planning and operation through ELETROBRAS (pars. 3.5.1).  The national
civil works contractors were subject to foreign competition (para. 3.2.1).
The level of parallel financing from bilateral agencies did not conform to
Bank expectations (para. 3.3.5) but was, nonetheless, satisfactory for
meeting the needs of FURNAS w.th respect to the Project.
4.3    Market Growth, 1971-1982
4.3.1       Aggregate actual and forecast regional sales levels were close:
746,160 GWh.vs.735,375 GWh, a difference of only 1.5% (Annex 4.1). The
regional power market grew about as expected, even though it reflected the
effect of factors not anticipated at appraisal, such as the development of
the metallurgical industry in Espirito Santo.  Other unexpected factors
included the petroleum crisis (1972-1976), the substitution of electrical
energy for petroleum (1917-1980), and major economic problems (1981-1982).
During the years 1981 and 1982, years of macroeconomic difficulty for Brazil,
regional sales levels were modestly less thtn expected (-1.651 and -6.46%,
respectively).  The modest regional shortfadls involved larger shortfall for
FURNAS.
4.3.2       For the period 1971-1982, the actual aggregate level of FURNAS
sales (27,230 RR) was less than the forecast level (29,747 9R) (Annex 4.2).
Most of the shortfall occurred during the years 1981-1982; but the shortfall
did not Jeopardize the economic Justification of the Project, as regional
electricity demand has since resumed growth at a high level.



- 12 -
4.4    Least-Cost Justification
4.4.1       The appraisal report compared Itumbiara and Agua Vermel-ha (to be
built by a-state power company) against various thermal (oil-fired or
nuclear) alternatives (para. 2.2.3) and found Itumbiara to be part of the
least-cost expansion program. There is no evidence to suggest that the
project as completed was not part of the least-cost solution.
4.4.2       At appraieal, the cost of the Marimbondo plant was US$192/kW (in
constant 1973 prices) compared with the then prevailing cost range of the
average hkdro plant in other regions of Brazil, US$485-777. The actual.
per-kW cost was about US$232 (in 1Q73 prices), an increase of 20.3X. The
actual per-kW price remained well below the range of costs prevailing at the
time of appraisal. In spite of the increase in plant cost, Itumbiara
remains the least-cost solution when compared with an oil-fired thermal
plant, as the investment costs of the latter would have been no less than
US$232/kW (in constant 1973 prices) and the operating costs of a thermal
plant would reflect fuel expenditures which have increased substantially
since 1973.
4.5    Internal Rate of Return
4.5.1       The appraisal report indicated an internal rate of return on
investment of 22.9%. On the basis of actual investment costs, actual and
expected tariff levels, and actual and expected operating costs (in constant
1973 prices), a similar analysis shows a return of 9.11. This low return
reflects the deterioration of the real level of tariffs which occurred in
recent years since tariffs are used as a proxy measure of benefits. The
lower rate of return also reflects the expansio-L of the scope and cost of the
distribution portion of the Project.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1   Actual and Forecast Financial Data, 1973-1982
5.1.1       Annex 5.1 sets forth actual and forecast key financial ratios of
FURNAS for the years 1973-1982. Annex 5.1 also sets forth the corresponding
financial ratios of the sector. Comparison of the actual ratios of FURNAS
and the sector on a year-by-year basis shows that the financial performances
of FURNAS and the sector were close -- that is, the financial performance of
FURNAS exhibited decline after 1978 while still modeatly surpassing
the financial performance of the sector. In addition to slowing sales
growth, the declining financial performances of FURNAS and the sector were
primarily due to the reduction in the real level of tariffs, which reflected
the effort-of the Government to control inflation.
5.1.2       Annexes 5.2 to 5.4 compare actual and forecast income statements,
sources and applications of funds, and balance sheets for the
years 1973-1982.   Annexes 5.5 and 5.6  set forth actual  data for
sources and applications of funds, and cost of service and remuneration for
the sector for the years 1973-1982.  The following paragraphs discuss the
information shown in the annexes in the context of Government policies for
the power sector.
5.2   Government Tariff and Financin  Policies for the Sector 1964-1982;
Revenue Covenants; and Tariff Agreements of Lhe Early 1980's.
5.2.1     Under the present sector organization (paras. 1.2.1 to 1.2.4), the
Government takes the most significant financial decisions, particularly with
respect to the setting of tariff levels, with little participation on the
part of the state governments and power utilities. As an understanding of
Government policy with respect to tariffs and financing for the power sector
is fundamental to an understanding of the financial performance of the
individual power utilities, the following sets forth a brief description of
Government policy over the last twenty years. There is also a discussion of
the various revenue agreements negotiated by Brazilian power authorities with
the Bank since 1980.
5.2.2     In the early 1960's, by establishing ELETROBRAS, and later in the
early 1970's, by delineating the responsibilities of the Federal and State
operating companies, the Government created a new structure for sector
organization to make the power sector an important contributing facitor to the
economic development of Brazil. To provide adequate levels of funding for
the sector investment program, the Government contributed high levels of
equity funding and set tariffs at realistic levels - that is, at levels
sufficient to earn the legal rate of remuneration (10-12%) on annually
revalued remunerable assets.



- 14 -
5.2.3     As a result of these tariff policies, the contribution cf consumer
based funding to the growing investment program increased steadily throughout
the r&d 1970's, at -which time the sector reached a peak of financial
sounlness. In 1973, the net (after debt servite) coesumer-basei funding
amounted to 56% of the sector funding mix whereas borrowing had a share of
only 30%. Equity contribution composed the balance of the funding mix.
5.2.4     The oLl crisis of the mid 1970's created a new set of financial
conditions for the power sector: (i) inflation affected substantially the
unit costs of the investment program of the sector; and (ii) the Government's
fight against inflation resulted in a deterioration of real tariff levels and
of the consutner-based contribution to the investment program. As a
consequence of these conditions, the sector became increasingly dependent on
borrowings, resulting in a heavy debt service burden in the late 1970's and
early 1980's.
5.2.5     Section 5.06 of the Loan Agreement and Section 3.02 of the
Guarantee Agreement for Loan 923-BR required, respectively: (i) FURNAS to
take all action necessary for tariffs to be set at levels to produce revenues
as provided by Brazilian law; and (ii) the Government to take all reasonable
action necessary to enable FURNAS to comply with obligations contained in the
Loan Agreement. Brazilian law called for a return of 10-12% on remunerable
assets, which level the sector failed to earn subsequent to 1978. For the
period 1973-1982, the compliance of FURNAS with the revenue covenant was
satisfactory. The following table compares the actual rates of remuneration
of the sector and FURNAS for selected years.
Rates of Remuneration (%) 1976-1981
1974     1976     1978      1979     1980      1981    1982

5.2&6     In 1980, having experienced increasingly disappointing results In
obtaining compliauce on the part of the power sector with existing revenue
covenants, the Bank reached an understanding whereby the Government would
increase tariff levels to achieve a rate of remuneration of 10% in 1981 and
future years and the recovery of revenue shortfalls of prior years over a
three-year period. The table above shows a substantial improvement in the
rate of remuneration of the sector in 19E1, as compared with the previous
year, but a rate of remuneration which still fell short of the level agreed
in 1980. In 1981, sales growth declined as compared with prior years because
of macroeconomic conditions, consideration of which further inhibited the
Government from raising power tariffs sufficiently to earn a return of 10%.



- 15 -
This unwillingness to raise tariff levels led to additional discussions with
the Bank and the formulation of a new revenue agreement.
5.2.7     In October 1981, the Bank and the Government agreed that the latter
would increase tariff levels by 32 in real terms in 1982 and 5X annually
therafter, until the sector achieved a 10% rate of remuneration and past
shortfalls were recovered. Having accepted this new approach, the Bank
formally agreed not to require compliance on the part of Brazilian power
borrowers with existing revenue covenants. In November 1983, this approach
was amended; both parties agreed on a program of tariff action and other
measures to increase the sector rate of remuneration by one percentage point
each year until 1989, When the sector should earn a return of 10%. The
various agreements referred to above did not lead to an amendment of the
revenue covenants of FURNAS, under Loan 923-BR. Rather, the Bank committed
itself not to seek enforcement of these covenants as long as tariff levels
were increased as agreed.
5*2.8     The successive revenue agreements after 1980 reflected the efforts
on the part of the Bank and Brazilian power authorities to establish tariff
levels under adverse and trying circumstances. With respect to the most
recently established revenue agreement (1983), the financial performance of
the sector in 1984 has been satisfactory; but the restoration of sector
finances will not be achieved in the near term.
5.2.9     The following paragraphs discuss the financial performance of
FURNAS.
5.3 S Sales, Tariff Levels, and Finances, 1973-1982

performance of FURNAS for the period 1973-1982, the period of project
implementation originally expected at appraisal.

5.3.2     The table above shows that actual aggregate sales (216,872 GWh)
were 8.9X less than the level (238,065) GWh expected at appraisal.  The
shortfall of actual sales was due to lower market growth and macroeconomic
problems in 1980-1982.ln other reapects, the actual and forecast operating
results (such as revenues and expenses) of FURNAS are not close. For
example, actual average revenue per kWh sold declined from Cr$0.089 in 1973
to Cr$0.067 in 1982 while average operating expense per kWh sold remained
close to the level of Cr$0.018 throughout the period. In contrast, the
appraisal forecast reflected the expectation that average revenue per kWh
sold would decline from Cr$0.110 in 1973 to Cr$0.095 in 1982 (with the
average level at Cr$0.113) while average ojarating costs per kWh sold would
decline from an expected level of Cr$0.034 Ia 1973 to Cr$0.015 in 1982 (Annex
5.1). Staff of the Bank and FURNAS Could not explain the discrepancy between
appraisal forecast and actual operating cost.s.
5.3.3     The actual level of investment expenditures (Cr$23,389.1 million)
was substantially greater (92.2Z) than that which was expected at appraisal
due to cost increases, especially with respect to the Angra nuclear program.
Tme Bank was aware of a nuclear program as oarly as 1969, accepted the
financing plan proposed for the over-all FUFJAS expansion plan in 1972
(including the nuclear program), and agreed with expansion program for the
Southern and Southeastern regions in 1975 (para. 3.5.1), which included the
nuclear program.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PBRFORNANCE
.6.1    The Government and the Borrower
6.1.1       FURNAS is the largest of the ELETROBRAS subsid'aries.  It enjoys
a history of good management and organization. With respect to the Project,
its performance was fully satisfactory.
6.1.2       By holding down tariffs, tlae Government has weakened the sector
which has also been affected by the economic recession and recent sequences
of devaluations. Despite this developmant, the Brazilian power sector
continues to be very well managed with a better than average performance in
satisfying an extremely rapid market growth and with good investment
planning.
6.2    The Bank
6.2.1       Working relations between the Bank and FURNAS have been
excellent. Loan 923-BR and other Bank loans have supported the efforts of
Brazilian authorities to promote sound institutional and technical
development. In particular, the Bank loans to FURNAS helped to finance an
economic program of generation and transmission expansion in south-central
Brazil, as originally laid down by CANAMBRA (para. 2.1.1). In addition, the
supervision work of Bank staff has encouraged coordinated operationswand
planning (see Project Completion Report on the Salto Osorio Project, dated
March 19, 1979) and sound sector financing (paras. 5.2.5 - 5.2.8), even if
actual results have not achieved the levels of expected results.
6.2.2       In the late 1970's and 1980's, as part of its effort to combat
inflation and taking into account economic and political considerations, the
Government did not adjust tariff levels in the amounts required by the
original revenue covenants. The Bank took an understanding attitude toward
the changed conditions of the Brazilian economy, and accordingly negotiated
in 1981 and 1983 new sector revenue agreements. Subsequent financial
performance of the sector was in conformity with these agreements and
indicated that Brazilian power authorities took a serious attitude with
respect to their obligations. Renegotiation and enforcement of new
revenue agreements was a reasonable approach; and indicated flexibility on
the part of Bank management towards new economic conditions (paras. 5.2.7
and 5.2.8).

VII. LISSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.1    Monltoring Sector Policies
7.1.1       The sectoral developments during the execution of Itumblara
Project (para. 6.1.2) illustrate the need to pay continuing attention to
basic policies even in relatively weil-managed national power sectors, such
as that of Brazil.
