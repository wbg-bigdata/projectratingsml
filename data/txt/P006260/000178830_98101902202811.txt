IlNTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO FURNAS - CENTRAIS EL2TRICAS, S.A.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE R-EPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR THE ITUMBIARA HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Furnas - Centrais E1etricas, S.A. (Furnas), with the guarantee of
the Federative Republic of Brazil, for the equivalent of US$125 million to
help finance the Itumbiara hydroelectric project. The loan would have a
term of thirty years, including seven years of grace, with interest at
7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "The Economic and Social Development
of Brazil" (R73-87), dated March 12, 1973, was distributed to the Executive
Directors in April 1973. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I. A
review of Brazil's macro-economic performance, its income distribution and
economic policy was contained in the President's Report on a loan for a
Power Distribution and Sub-Transmission project (R73-58) which was approved
by the Board on April 10, 1973. The passages concerned are included in
Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL
Bank Operations
3.        A description of the Bank's lending strategy in Brazil was also
contained in the President's Report on the Power Distribution and Sub-
Transmission loan, and is reproduced in Annex I. Bank lending to Brazil
was very active in FY72, when seven loans totalling US$437 million were
made. In FY73, five loans amounting to US$133.7 million have been made
covering an Agricultural Settlement project in Northeast Brazil, the Fourth
Highway Construction project, a Grain Storage project, an Interim Second
Livestock Development project and the above-mentioned Power Distribution
and Sub-Transmission project. A loan of US$54 million for an agro-industries
credit project will be presented to the Executive Directors shortly. We
are also holding discussions with the Brazilians on an investment program



- 2 -
in the port of Recife, a highway project, a railway rehabilitation program,
a hydroelectric project on the Sao Francisco River in the Northeast, a
water supply program, a land settlement project in the Amazon and a third
livestock development project, which would extend that program to smaller
farmers. We hope to present these projects to the Executive Directors in
the next twelve months.
4.        By April 30, 1973, Brazil had received 46 loans from the Bank
amounting to US$1,566.3 million. Of the loans declared effective, 31
have not been fully disbursed. During FY65 through FY69, disbursements
averaged only US$10 million per year, increasing to US$66 million in FY70,
US$75 million in FY71, US$137 million in FY72, and US$92 million in the
first half of FY73. Disbursements should continue to increase during
the next few years. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loan
as of April 30, 1973, and notes on the execution of ongoing project.
IFC Operations
5.        IFC has committed more financial resources to Brazil than to
any other country. Since 1957,IFC has made 21 commitments to Brazil,
totalling US$103.3 million, of which US$7.2 million has been repaid and
US$38.6 million sold. Of the balance of US$5765 million, US$40.6 million
represents loans and US$16.9 million equity. A summary of IFC's invest-
ments up to April 30, 1973, is also given in Annex II.
PART III - THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
6.        The proposed loan to Furnas for the Itumbiara Hydroelectric
project would be the Bank's twenty-sixth for the development of the
power sector in Brazil. Since 1967, the Bank has helped finance six
power projects: the Porto Colombia hydroelectric project of Furnas
V san 565-BR), the Volta Grande hydroelectric project of CEMIG (Loan
566-BR), the Marimbondo hydroeLectric project of Furnas (Loan 677-BR),
the Salto Osorio hydroelectric project of ELETROSUL (Loan 728-BR), the
Sao Simgo hydroelectric project of CEMIG (Loan 829-BR), and the Power
Distribution and Sub-Transmission project of LIGHT (Loan 877-BR).
Electric Power Development
7.        The electric power sector is regulated by the Ministry of Mines
.nd Energy through the NationaL Department of Water and Electric Energy
(Di EE), ~wh.ech is responsible for tariff sett ing, approval of the expan-
sion plans of the concessionarles, and gathering of statistical informa-
tion; and Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras (ELETROBRAS) which has been
responsible for sector financing and sector coordination. ELETROBRAS has
majority interest in thirteen power companies and a minority interest in
twenty-three others.



- 3 -
8.        The average rate of growth of electric power consumption in Brazil
from 1967 to 1971 was 11 percent; in 1971 it was 12.7 percent. Regional
disparities, however. were large. The Northeast, with a 140 KWh per capita
consumption in 1971 grew at 15.5 percent, whereas the Southeast, with 795
KWh per capita, grew at 10.3 percent.
9.        The expansion of the sector has been greatly assisted by legisla-
tion requiring annual electricity tariff adjustments to ensure that tariffs
provide an adequate return (now 10-12 percent) on the net revalued fixed
assets and working capital of the enterprises. Taxes and special surcharges
added to the above return, all earmarked for expansion of the sector, bring
the average return to 16-17 percent for the sector. ELETROBRAS, administers
a substantial and rising percentage of the financial resources of the sector:
it was 30.5 percent in 1971 and is estimated to rise to 50.7 percent in 1975,
as a result of a special surcharge now being channeled through ELETROBRAS.
10.       In order to meet its demand for power, Brazil will have to install
an average of 2,100 MW per year in 1973-76 and spend about US$1.2 billion
equivalent per year. Because of the need to channel their contributions to
sectors less able to raise funds internally for expansion, the Federal and
State Governments will be reducing their contributions to the power sector
from 11.2 percent of the 1971 investment program to 5.5 percent of the 1975
investment program. Since the cppacity of local capital markets is still
limited, the power sector will have to continue to rely heavily on funds
generated within the sector. It is expected that this source will con-
tribute roughly 60 percent of the 1971-75 program (70 percent if compulsory
loans from consumers are included). Most of the balance is to come from
external financing. During the late sixties, the financing gap between
sector requirements and funds generated within the sector plus government
contributions was primarily filled by the Bank, the IDB and USAID; but
assistance from these sources will not suffice in the seventies and
additional sources of financing are being sought. To mobilize new sources
and maximize foreign participation, Brazil has been engaging in joint and
parallel financing schemes such as those in two projects partially financed
by the Bank, the Marimbondo and Sao Simao projects, under which bilateral
credits have financed a substantial part of imported equipment and the
Bank has predominantly financed the items (including civil works) for which
bilateral credits are not normally available on favorable terms. Similarly
in the proposed loan for the Itumbiara project the Bank would be financing
goods and services, including civil works, not suitable for bilateral
external finance, thus allowing Furnas, and Brazil, to maximize the inflow
of long-term capital. Bank financing of civil works would have the additional
advantage for the Brazilian economy of exposing Brazilian civil works contrac-
tors to international competitive bidding.
11.       ELETROBPAS has gradually assumed greater responsibility for sector
financing, planning and coordination, functions which have become increasingly
important in Brazil, particularly in the South and Southeast regions, whlEch
account for over 85 percent of the total electric power consumption of the
country and where consumption has doubled during the past eight years. How-
ever, ELETROBRAS has in the past lacked the legal authority to carry out



satisfactorily the necessary sector studies or to impose its decisions on
the various state power companies, and pressures of local and state
interests have at times led to decisions which did not result in the optimal
use of resources.
12.       The Government has recently decided to consolidate and strengthen
substantially the position of ELETPOBRAS as technical, financial and admpin-
istrative coordinator of the electric power sector, and a bill on electric
power to that effect, sent to Congress on May 15, is now under consideration.
The proposed law would define more precisely the responsibilities of
ELETR0BRAS3 regional subsidiaries for generation, transmission and inter-
connection of systems in their respective areas of operation. It would~ allow
the Government to expropriate and transfer to ELETROBPAS transmission lines
now belonging to state companies but which are currently used mainly to
transfer power between states. Perhaps most important, the law would require
that ELETROBRAS:
(a) organize and direct special groups (made up of representa-
tives of the concessionary companies) to improve opera-
tional coordination of the interconnected systems of the
Southeast and South regions; and
(b)  provide to the Ministry of Mines and Energy, prior to
December 31, 1973, power generation and major transmission
development plans for the Southeast and South regions for
the period until 1951 and subsequently, prior to December
31, 1974, similar plans for the period until 1990.
lhe Bank welcomes these measures and, during negotiations, the Government
agreed to submit these plans, and subsecuent proposed changes in the plans,
to the Baxk for comments.
A primary reason for the proposal of the new law on electric power
was the agreement between the Governments of Paraguay and Brazil to proceed
with construction of a particularly large hydroelectric plant (Itaipu) on
the Darana River between Paraguay and Brazil.  This hydroelectric project,
which is estimated to cost about US$2,000 million for a 12,000 MEl installation
and associated transmission facilities, is being prepared by ELETROBRAS of
Brazil and ANDE of Paraguay and is expected to provide in the `980's an
insta'led capacity equivalent to two-thirds of all existing installed capacity
i-n Brazil.  Purnas and ELETROSUL (the ELETROBRAS subsidiary serving the South
Df 3razil) would be responsible for the transmission of the Brazilian share
of the Itaipu-generated power. The Goverrr:ent intends, through the regula-
tJiDons on the priority use of Itaipu-generated power also included in the
proposed legislation, to:
(a) guarantee a fair division of the benefits of low cost electric
power obtained from Itaipu among all customers of the regions
that can be served by it; and



- 5 -
(b) ensure a more rational utilization of thermo-electric plants
as complements to hydroelectric systems and attempt to avoid
the waste of hydraulic resources and of fuels, particularly
those which are scarce and must be imported.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
14.       The project is the next step in the development of the hydroelectric
potential of the Paranaiba River, one of the major tributaries of the Parana
River, draining a basin extending south from Brasilia. It was identified
during the CANAMBRA studies in 1965. It is upstream of Sgo Simgo, where a
hydroelectric plant partially financed by the Bank is under construction by
CRIIG. The Itumbiara project was appraised in January 1973, and negotiations
were held in May 1973, with Dr. Alipio de Barros and Dr. Mario Bhering
representing the Government and the Furnas delegation headed by Dr. John
Cotrim.
15.       The project consists of a dam and a hydroelectric power station
designed for 2,080 MW, 1,760 km of transmission facilities, and associated
transformer and switching stations.
16.       The Itumbiara dam would be 7 km long with a maximum height of 106
meters. It would create a reservoir with a usable storage capacity of 13,700
million cubic meters, regulating a catchment of 95,000 km2, which yields a
mean annual flow of approximately 1,500 cubic meters per second. The gross
capacity of the reservoir is 17,000 million cubic meters. The dam would
provide an 80 meter head with the reservoir at the maximum normal operating
level. The total average annual dependable energy production would be 9,000
GWh. The installed capacity would result in a plant factor of 36 percent,
and would increase the generating capability of downstream plants.
17.       A single circuit 500 kV transmission system totalling 520 km would
connect the Itumbiara station with the Marimbondo and Sgo Simgo hydroelectric
stations, thus providing interconnection of the Furnas and CEMIG systems with
large capacity for power interchange. The proposed interconnection is a
significant step toward fuller integration of power facilities in Southeast
Brazil. A 345 kV line will connect Itumbiara to Brasilia, and the 138 kV
system will be extended into the State of Espirito Santo, one of the poorest
of Brazil.
18.       Annex III summarizes the loan and project summary.   The Appraisal
Report (150a-BR, May 29, 1973) is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors.
The Borrower
19.       The borrower would be Furnas, a corporation established in 1957 and
the largest subsidiary of ELETROBRAS. Furnas is a bulk producer and sells only
at wholesale to other utilities. It is a major supplier for the Rio de Janeiro



- 6 -
market through LIGHT and several smaller distributors, for the Sao Paulo
market through LIGHT and one other small company, and it also sells to
CalIG and the Companhia El6trica de Brasilia, S.A. Furnas owns three
hydroelectric plants with an installed capacity of 2,160 NW, a thermal
plant with an installed capacity of 360 NW and an extensive high-
voltage transmission system. Two hydroelectric plants, financed with
Bank assistance are now under construction. In addition, Furnas is now
building a nuclear plant, the first in Brazil, with an installed capacity
of 630 MW and expected to be in operation by late 1977. Expansion of
existing plants and completion of plants under construction will increase
Furnas' installed capacity to 5,370 MW by the end of 1977.
20.       Furnas has over the years substantially strengthened its opera-
tions, organization and staff -- due mainly to a competent, hard-working
group of senior executives. Some 20 employees annually are sent to the
United States and European countries for graduate study and practical
training in the technical and financial fields.  In addition, Furnas has
converted some of the buildings in the construction village at the Furnas
dan into a training school for operating and maintenance technicians, who
are drawn from its own organization as well as from other utilities in
Brazil. For the design and construction of major projects, Furnas employs
consu_ting engineers and hires contractors.  For the Itumbiara project,
Furnas has in addition enmployed a consulting board of experts in geology,
soil mechanics, concrete and civil engineering construction to adivse on
the design.
Between 195S and 1970 the Ban@k made five loans to Furnas totalling
US5'11l.3 million equivalent for the construction of hydroelectric plants
and related transmission. Approximately US$207.7 million had been disbursed
Pnd ITS$?66.6 mill½ior. repaid by April 30, 19073. Bank experience with Furnas
habs -been satisfactory.
nrfinreer an1d  onstr'oct4an
.onstruction of preliminary works for the dam and hydroelectric
plant tias started by 'Furmas in early 1973 under force account and the main
civil wcDrks contractor is expected to start work in the field early in 1974.
Theh first generating unit is scheduled for commissioning in November 1979
anri the remaining units at three-month intervals thereafter.  Construction
of .:nsmission facilities -will start in 1975 and various portions will be
coili6i.e-±ed during the period 197i to i98I2.
.*..      Construction oi t"he main civil wcrks will be done on a unit price
basis b- experienced civil works contractors, selected through international
competitive bidding. Furnas owns consicierable construction equipment which
will be made available to the contractors. Installation of the generating
plant and other electrical equipment will be carried out by Furnas as has
been its successfTl practice in earlier projects. The erection of the
transmission line will be done by contractors under the supervision of Furnas.



-7-
Cost Estimates
24.       The cost estimate was prepared in mid-1972 and updated in May 1973
by Furnas in collaboration with its consultants; Furnas and the consultants
have broad and recent experience building similar projects in Brazil. Because
of geologic uncertainties affecting the cost of construction of the founda-
tion for the earth embankment, a contingency allowance of 20 percent (or
US$36 million equivalent) has been added to the estimate of the civil works
for the dam. Other contingency allowances are normal for this type of
project.
25.       The cost of the Itumbiara hydroelectric station excluding interest
during construction is estimated at US$439.7 million equivalent, of which
US$170.5 million equivalent is the estimated foreign cost component. The
cost of the transmission system is estimated at US$153.5 million equivalent,
-of which US$49.0 million equivalent is the estimated foreign cost component.
The total cost of the project is thus estimated at US$593.2 million equivalent,
with an estimated foreign exchange component of US$219.5 million equivalent.
The latter amount would be financed mainly by the proposed Bank loan and an
estimated US$76 million of bilateral credits. The remainder of the financing
for the project would come from domestic resources including FURNASt internal
cash generation, loans from ELETROBRAS and Federal Government contributions.
Since it is not possible to associate specific domestic funds with the
Itumbiara project, the internal resources available to FURNAS are best viewed
in the context of the overall financing plan for the company's long-term
expansion program.

27.       Furnas' substantial gross internal cash generation is premised on
a rate of return of 12 percent on remunerable investments; the debt service
resulting from its proposed financial plan would be covered more than 1.5
times by internal cash generation in any year during the period 1973-82;
and a 12 percent cash dividend would be paid each year. Thus, in the
period 1973-82, net internal cash generation would finance about 20 percent
of Furnas' construction program and working capital increase. The remainder
would be covered by the proposed Bank loan (7 percent), previous Bank loans
(5 percent), other existing and proposed foreign borrowing (29 percent),
local borrowings from ELETROBRAS (37 percent) -- of which eventually about
half would be converted into share capital by ELETROBRAS -- and Federal
Government contribution (2 percent).
22.       Proposed new foreign borrowings other than from the Bank would be
comprised of:
(a) Parallel financing for equipment for the Itumbiara proJect
likely to be purchased abroad amounting to about US$76
million for an assumed term of fifteen years, including five
years of grace, at interest rates expected to average around
7-1/2 percent. Furnas has already been in touch with export
financing agencies in major equipment supplying countries
and has received indications of their willingness to
participate in the parallel financing scheme on the terms
indicated.
(b)  Future possible foreign borrowings amounting to US$278 mil-
lion for projects scheduled to start in 197, the bulk of
which would only be needed from 1978 onwards. These bor-
roarings are projected to be for periods of between fifteen
and twenty years, including a grace period of five years,
at interest of 7 to 7-1/h percent.
'.<.      New borrowing from ELETROBRAS will amount to about US$570 million
for terms of fifteen and twenty years, including five years of grace, at 11
percent interest plus monetary correction. ELETPOBRAS will connect loans to
equity, to maintain an adequate capital structure for the company.
31.       The Federal Government is expected to make a contribution of about
US$34 million towards the construction cost of the nuclear plant for which
capital expenditures of about US$220 million are scheduled in the period
1973-77.



32.       In line with the Bank's most recent loan to Furnas (Loan 677-BR for
the Marimbondo hydroelectric project), Furnas has agreed that its debt shall
not exceed 66-2/3 percent of its total fixed assets. In addition, Furnas has
agreed to limit its debt with an original maturity of less than ten years to
5 percent of its total fixed assets.
33.       Furnas' financial performance, past and present, is satisfactory
and its outlook is equally satisfactory. This is due to good management, a
reasonable tariff policy and the ability to borrow substantial amounts from
ELETROBRAS. The financial plan is reasonable; during negotiations the Govern-
ment agreed that in case Furnas would not have sufficient funds to assure the
timely completion of the project, these funds would be provided by the Govern-
ment.
34.       All power generated by Furnas is sold under contract to oth-
utilities for resale to the ultimate consumers; these utilities also have
generating facilities of their own, the largest of which is LIGHT serving
the areas of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. The utilities which purchase
Pirnas' power and their actual and projected sales and peaks are shown in
Annex 3.  In 1972, Furnas' energy sales were 11,400 GW^h (1,335 average MW)
and the maximum demand was 2,180 MW; total energy sales in the Southeast
region for that year were 38,000 GWh (provisional figures).
Procurement and Disbursement
35.       The civil works contracts for the hydroelectric plant would be
awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement. Disbursement for the civil works would be made
against 35 percent (the estimated foreign exchange component) of the amount
billed in the contractor's periodic invoices, to a total of US$60 million.
If the civil works contract proves more or less than the estimate, the full
US$60 million would be disbursed, with the percentage being modified to
enable disbursement over the full construction period. The remaining US$65
million part of the loan would be disbursed for equipment contracts to be
awarded through international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement, Brazilian manufacturers being given a 15
percent margin of preference. The goods to be financed by this part of the
proposed loan were chosen for Bank financing because Brazilian manufacturers
are likely to be competitive for such goods; consequently, they would be less
suitable for bilateral external finance. To the extent that Brazilian manu-
facturers do in fact win contracts, the Bank loan will cover some local costs.
This is justified by the volume and nature of Brazil's overall capital required
ments (see Annex I, paragraph 8). No disbursements would be made for costs
incurred prior to the signing of the loan.
36.       The equipment required for the rest of the project would be procured
on the basis of competitive bidding among countries which have agree are
Furnas' request for bilateral financing for equipment procured from their
territories. Brazilian equipment manufacturers would also participate in this
bidding with a 15 percent margin of preference and if they win the award, the
orders will be financed by a Government agency.



- 10 -
37.       Annex III contains a projected schedule of disbursements from the
Bank loan.
Economic Justification
38.       In Brazil the Federal Government authorizes the construction of
generating plants as part of a comprehensive plan aiming to meet, at the
lowest cost, the energy requirements of each region. The Itumbiara project
is the least cost solution, in the context of meeting both the companyts
and the region's forecast growth in power demand. It is also the optimum
power development of this segment of the Paranaiba River. On the assumption
that the economic value of the electricity supplied is at least equal to the
value paid by the ultimate consumer, i.e., the tariff charge plus surcharges,
the return on the investment in the Itumbiara project would be 22.9 percent.
Environmental Aspects
39.       At the Bankts suggestion, the environmental aspects of the project
have been studied by a consultant specializing in this field who has prepared
a comprehensive report. It is evident that the impact will be relatively
small fot such a large project because of its remoteness and the low popula-
tion density in its vicinity; there are 3,700 persons to be relocated
including one town of 216, a small part of another town containing about 75
persons and about 80 farmsteads with their proprietors and farm labor. Furnas
has not completed its plans for the relocation of the population but is well
aware of the socio-cultural needs of the people. During negotiations Furnas
agreed to complete and implement a plan satisfactory to the Bank for popula-
tion relocation. Such a plan would include:
(a) a classification of the poDulation affected by the project
by type (landowner, workers), number and income;
(b) a description of the resettlement alternatives offered;
(c) a proposed employment plan, including eventual training; and
(d) an implementation schedule and cost estimates.
4c.       T'he consultant's report notes the severe over-grazing within the
watershed and the resulting extensive erosion, and suggests steps for water-
shed management mostly in the nature of reforestation on certain selected
areas. Furnas is planning to send its real estate manager to the United
States fcr instruction on this subject and inspection of such operations in
areas containing large reservoirs. The report also contains many important
suggestions for the control of disease, preservation of fish and wildlife,
etc., which would require the attention of established Government bureaus in
Brazil. Furnas will bring the report to the attention of the competent
authorities; during negotiations the Government assured the Bank that the
suggestions will be given full consideration.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Loan Agreement between Furnas - Centrais El6tricas, S.A.,
and the Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Federative Republic
of Brazil and the Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of
a resolution approving the proposed loan, are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The major features of these agreements
have already been described in this report.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.       I recommend that the Ececutive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

THE ECONOMY
(Extract from Report and Recommendation of the President to the Executive
Directors on a proposed loan to Light - Servicos de Eletricidade, S.A.
for a Power Distribution and Sub-Transmission Project)
Macro-Economic Performance
3.        After having grown by about 9 percent annually during 1968-70
Brazil's national product increased by an estimated 11 percent in 1971.
Indications are that growth was at least equally rapid in 1972. Indus-
trial production during the first six months of 1972 was almost 15 per-
cent greater in real terms than during the equivalent period in 1971.
Output of Brazil's principal crops excluding coffee appears to have
increased by about 10 percent in 1972. Simultaneously, the Government
succeeded in its effort to reduce the annual rate of inflation from 20
to 15 percent. Reflecting good weather and sharp increases in crop
yields. food supplies were abundant and food prices rose by only about
half as much in 1972 as in 1971.
4.        Export growth and diversification continue to be strong.
After slowing down from 19 percent in 1970 to 5 percent in 1971, largely
as a result of a drop in coffee prices, export growth accelerated during
1972. However, the extremely high rate of economic growth continues to
cause large increases in imports, which were up by about 27 percent in
the first semester of 1972 after increasing 20 percent in 1971. The
current account deficit in the balance of payments is likely to have
exceeded US$1.5 billion in 1972 compared with US$1.3 billion in 1971.
The increase in imports and in the size of the current account deficit
associated with the high rate of growth in recent years is a matter of
concern to the Brazilian authorities, since they recognize that it would
be difficult to finance such large trade deficits on a sustained basis.
For that reason, they aim to hold the rate of growth of imports below
that of exports, both by accelerating the pace of growth of exports and
by reducing import requirements. There is a good prospect that objective
can be achieved if the rate of growth of GDP is held to a level near the
8.5 percent per annum projected in the economic report. However, for
the present, the Government, rather than taking action immediately to
moderate the present 11 percent rate of growth, is giving additional
attention to export promotion and import substitution, through the system
of incentives for exports of manufactures, an "export corridors" program
designed to expand non-traditional agricultural exports such as corn,
soya and beef, and encouragement of domestic production of capital goods,
raw materials and intermediate goods (chemicals, petroleum and non-ferrous
metals). The authorities realize that if these programs fail to cont.in
the trade gap, they may have to take action to reduce the rate of growth,
but they feel that the balance of payments position is now strong enough
to make such action unnecessary in the near term.

5.        The substantial :increase during 1971-72 in Brazil's foreign
exchange reserves, to a level approaching US$L billion, was largely a
result of a large inflow of foreign capital. In 1972, more than
US$4.7 billion in gross loian capital, of which US$3.5 billion was in
the form of financial credits, flowed into Brazil. Financial credits
represent, to some extent, a substitute for foreign direct investment
which takes this form because of more favorable tax and administrative
treatment accorded to interest payments than to profit remittances.
They are also a result of foreign borrowing by Brazilian private and
public enterprises necessitated by imperfections in the domestic
financial market which make loan and equity funds both expensive and
scarce. Their growth in recent years reflects the attractiveness of
Brazilian prosperity and stability to the international financial
community. However, the accumulation of financial credits is greater
than the Government expected, and to prevent this debt from causing
foreign liquidity problems, the authorities have imposed comprehensive
controls on debt maturities. The average term on new financial credits
in 1972 was four years as compared with two years in 1971 and a minimum
maturity of six years is now required. To protect the external liquidity
position, the Government is deliberately following a monetary policy which
results in substantial foreign exchange reserve accumulation. These re-
serves give the authorities an adequate margin of time to adjust their
overall economic policy in the event that the financial flows should be
reversed. The need to offset much of the increase in financial credits
with foreign exchange reserves reduces greatly the contribution which
such financial credits can make toward financing the trade deficit.   In
this context, the existence of large reserves does not indicate that
Brazil has no need to increase the flow of long-term capital from abroad.
6.        Financial credits are only a partial and imperfect substitute
for long-term capital.  The inflow of such credits, net of reserve build-
up, cannot be depended upon to cover as large a proportion of Brazil's
current account deficit as in the recent past if the debt service burden
is to remain manageable. A country at Brazil's stage of development can
be expected to run substantial current account deficits if rapid growth
is to be sustained. The mobilization of large flows of official term
capital will, therefore, play a crucial role over the long term.
7.        By the end of 1972, Brazil's total external debt is likely
to have exceeded IIS$9 billion, of which over US$5 billion is financial
credits.  The overall debt service ratio was about 5L) percent in 1972,
but the substantial reserves which Brazil has accumulated assure
liquidity and should be taken into consideration when appraising credit-
worthiness.  Furthermore, this debt service ratio includes service on
all public and private debt, including that on financial credits, since
Brazil's debt data do not differentiate between public and private debt.
The debt service ratio for public and publicly guaranteed debt would be
very much lower. Service on total debt excluding financial credits (the
bulk of which is owed by private borrowers) was around 15 percent in 1972.

Nevertheless, it is clear that, however measured, Brazil's debt service
obligations are high. The country's creditworthiness depends on con-
tinued high caliber economic management.
8.        While the official loan capital needed to support Brazil's
economic growth targets is substantial, the direct import needs of most
public investment projects are relatively low, reflecting - inter alia --
the ability of Brazil's highly developed capital goods industry to com-
pete successfully under international competitive bidding. Hence, an
appreciable part of official external financing must continue to be
available to cover domestic expenditures.
Income Distribution and Economic Policy
9.        Although the overall growth and management of the Brazilian
economy in recent years has been outstanding Brazil continues to experience
highly unequal distribution of income accompanied by massive incidence of
absolute poverty. According to the best available statistics, in 1970 the
most affluent 20 percent of Brazil's income earners received 62.2 percent
of total money income while the poorest 20 percent received 3.2 percent of
total money income; i.e., the richest one-fifth of the population received
19 times as much income as did the poorest one-fifth. There occurred
reconcentration of income during the 1960's; in 1960 the income received
by the most affluent fifth was 16 times as great as the income received
by the poorest fifth. Absolute increases in money income levels were
achieved in every decile of the size distribution of Brazilian money
income during the 1960's. In the 9th and 10th deciles -- the highest
income brackets -- the increases were greatest, averaging 3.1 and 5.2 per-
cent annually in real terms, respectively. In the lowest four deciles
increases in per capita real money incomes averaged 1.7 percent per annum.
In part, the increases reflect increased monetization of the economy.
In 1970 the incidence of absolute poverty in Brazil continued to be high:
as much as one-third of total income recipients were receiving less than
Brazil's lowest legal minimum wage, about US$25 per month. It should be
added that the comparisons of changes in real terms suffer from more than
the usual statistical limitations in view of the degree of the Brazilian
inflation. Further analysis of income distribution problems will be
found in paragraphs 35 to 53 of the economic report.
10.       In the early 1960's poor economic management led to an accelera-
tion of inflation -- which peaked at an annual rate of 144 percent during
the first quarter of 1964 -- to balance of payments crisis -- which required
debt reschedulings in 1961 and 1964 -- and to economic stagnation; in 1963
per capita domestic product declined by 1.6 percent. Galloping inflation
tended to strike hardest at the wage earner, while economic stagnation left
the economy unable to absorb the large annual increments in its labor force.
Between 1964 and 1967 the Government implemented a price stabilization and
balance of payments retrenchment program. Not only did economic stagnation
continue during this period but stabilization efforts depended heavily on



ANNfEX I
Page 6 of 9
income restraint policies. Both the economic crisis of the early 1960's
and the corrective measures taken subsequently by the Government are
likely to have contributed significantly to the deterioration of income
distribution which took place during the decade.
11.       Having (a) reduced inflation to an annual rate of about 20 per-
cent; (b) instituted automatic adjustment mechanisms such as the flexible
exchange rate and monetary correction of financial instruments designed to
prevent price distortions from reemerging in a still inflationary environ-
ment; and (c) improved Brazil's capacity to import by promoting the ex-
pansion and diversification of exports, the Government, by 1968, was able
to undertake policies conducive to a resumption of the rapid economic
growth which the country had enjoyed in the 1950's. As noted, these
policies have been very successful.
12.       The Government counts primarily on the employment created at
rapid rates of growth to alleviate the dualism of the Brazilian economy
and the poverty which results from it. The Government also believes
that maintenance of steady growth -- i.e., avoidance of any acceleration
of inflation and/or external liquidity problems such as those which led
to the stop-and-go development of the early and mid-1960's -- is essential
if further concentration of incomes is to be forestalled. Finally, through
profits controls and wage guidelines the Government is seeking to insure
that wage earners receive a fair share of the benefits of rapid growth.
The growth of employment and -- in some sectors -- wage rates which has
taken place since 1968 probably accounts for most of the improvement in
lower level incomes shown for the entire decade by the 1960 and 1970
censuses.
13.       It thus appears that in order to correctly evaluate the impact
on income distribution of policies pursued by the present Government it
would be necessary to use 1968 as the basis for comparison with 1972 data.
Unfortunately, there are as yet no sufficient statistics available to
permit such a comparison. In any event, and notwithstanding job creation
and real wage increases which have been achieved since 1968, the Government
is determined to make additional efforts to overcome the regional and sec-
toral concentrations of poverty which characterize the Brazilian economy.
Here the Government regards as crucially important the fact that its own
propensity to save increases with the pace of economic growth. This is
because the tax structure -- its incidence concentrated in the industrial
sector, Brazil's growth leader -- is highly elastic to changes in GDP
while current expenditures are not. Much of the public sector savings
generated at high rates of growth are being used to finance programs of
great social significance. One of these is the program to reform and
expand the educational structure. Another is the housing program which,
in addition to resettling urban slum dwellers, has created an enormous
amount of employment. Still other programs are designed to expand potable
water and sewerage facilities, to improve nutrition, and to better the
medical facilities available to both urban and rural workers through the
social security system.



ANNEX I
Page 7 of 9
1.       The most difficult of the Government's social programs is its
Northeast regional development effort funded by tax sharing and invest-
ment tax credit mechanisms which directly transfer about 5 percent of
Brazil's total domestic savings to the Northeast from the relatively
affluent Center-South.  Through this program, Brazil has been a world
leader in the innovation of transfer mechanisms designed to redress
regional imbalances in the distribution of income. These mechanisms
have been in existence for some time but their impact became really
significant only with the tremendous improvement in taxing power
effected in the mid-1960?s. Moreover, until 1970, resources transferred
were concentrated on the industrialization of the Northeast. While this
enabled the overall growth of the Northeast economy to keep pace with
that of the rest of the country -- it had very sparse direct employment
effects. In 1970 and 1971 the Government restructured its Northeast
development effort, channelling about half of the resource transfe- to
that region into rural development programs designed to:
a) redistribute land in the Northeast;
b) equip Northeast farmers with the information and technical
inputs needed to improve their low productivity;
c) reorganize and reequip the inefficient but very important
Northeast sugar industry; and
d) resettle Northeast farmers -- as well as farmers from
other poor regions of the country -- on hitherto unexploited
land on the western margin of the Northeast and in the Amazon.
15.       These new rural development programs are only just now getting
underway on a significant scale. Given the need to coordinate Brazil's
various regional development agencies and to study carefully the impli-
cations of regional development goals -- particularly for the ecology
of the Amazon -- it will take time before results become highly visible.
Nevertheless, the effort which the Government is making remains a very
clear indication of its earnest desire to bring the benefits of develop-
ment to all the inhabitants of Brazil.

BANK LENDING ST,AT:TGY IN BRAZIL
(Extract from Report and Recommendation of the President to the Executive
Directors on a proposed loan to Light - Servicos de Eletricidade, S.A.
for a Power Distribution and Sub-Transmission Project)
16.       The Bank's lending strategy in Brazil is designed to support
in many ways the Government's development efforts. One important objec-
tive of the Bank's support (and which is especially important in lending
for power) is to help provide the necessary long-term external capital.
In this regard, the Bank seeks to play a complementary role to that of
other lenders, supplementing their resources in individual operations
and financing activities that they are unwilling to finance. Brazil
has needed and will continue to need a very large volume of medium- and
long-term loan capital inflows to sustain rapid growth and achieve its
employment creation and regional development objectives. As emphasized
earlier, the fact that it has accumulated large amounts of foreign
reserves in recent years by no means contradicts this. These reserves
have been accumulated because of the large volume of external financial
credits directed to Brazil and are necessary to maintain an adequate
degree of external liquidity.  Without this reserve cushion Brazilfs very
high overall debt service ratio would make it highly susceptible to ex-
ternal liquidity problems and to the kind of "stop-and-go" development
experienced in the 1960's.
17.       Another important objective of the Bank's lending strategy in
Brazil is to support adequate sector planning, institutional development
and policy reform, designed inter alia to ensure that public savings re-
sources are used economically and that an adequate volume of savings is
left available for application in the social sectors. This aspect of
our lending strategy is especially important in our lending in the trans-
portation sector.
18.       The Bank has also been helping to ease the foreign exchange
constraint on Brazilian development by supporting projects designed to
increase Brazil's export capacity and to substitute -- on an economic
basis -- imports.  The recently approved livestock project will help
provide the technological base for expansion of Brazil's livestock
e;:ports, an area in which it has considerable comparative advantage.
Support of Brazil's steel industry is helping to maintain Brazilian
self-sufficiency in a commodity which can be produced efficiently in
Brazil owing to that country's bountiful supply of high grade iron ore
and the scale of its internal market.
19.       The Bank is also making efforts to lend increasingly for
projects which will help alleviate human misery, improve the equality
of economic opportunity and increase incomes in the lowest brackets.
It has supported Brazil's education, water and sewerage and land settle-
ment programs; further support for these programs is under active pre-
paration. In addition we are seeking to identify new opportunities to



ANNEX I
Page 9 of 9
support small scale farming, low cost urban housing, mass urban transport,
and improved nutrition. However, such projects not only are hard to
identify but in many cases are small in magnitude. Moreover, when iden-
tified, such projects equally attract the interest of other development
lenders. It is, therefore, likely that, despite our efforts, only a
limited number of projects in these areas will be available and suitable
for Bank finance in the near future, and that for some time projects of
this kind will constitute only a fraction of total Bank lending to Brazil.
20.       The Bank is also trying to help Brazil in analyzing the social
impact of its development strategy. Bank missions have exchanged views
with the Government on such subjects as the effects of Government policies
on income distribution and regional growth, the impact of payroll taxation
on labor absorption, the capacity of local governments to absorb additional
federal revenue transfers, the cost of domestically produced fertilizer,
and the distribution of agricultural credit. These discussions have ..elped
to clarify the links between rapid economic growth and human welfare.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
There are now 31 effective Bank loans under disbursement:
Loan No.
403/h74   Estreito Hydroelectric Project:   US$57 and US$39 million
loans of February 26, 1965 and December 19, 1966; Closing
Date:  June 30, 1974.   The project is proceeding on schedule0
Equipment costs were substantially below estimates, so that
disbursements have been less than forecast. The original
closing date was April 1, 1971.
40       Xavantes Hydroelectric Project:   US$22.5 million loan of
February 27, 1965; Closing Date:  December 31, 1973.   The
project was completed in early 1971 (after a delay of about
eighteen months) except for the installation of equipment
for an associated transmission line. Ordering of this equip-
ment was delayed, and the loan is now expected to be fully
disbursed by December 31, 1973, four years after the initial
closing date. The original closing date was December 31, 1969,
postponed to December 31, 1971, and further postponed to
February 29, 1972.
442       Jaguara Hydroeloctric Project:   US$L9 million loan of
March 15, 196; Closing Date:    December 31, 1974.  All the
four generators were commissioned during 1971 and the project
has been completed. Disbursements will extend up to the end
of 1974 primarily because equipment originally defective
has made necessary a postponement of the last payments to
suppliers. The original closing date was April 30, 1971,
postponed to April 30, 1973.
475/h76/
h77/478   Power Distribution Projects:   TJs$6.2, US$8.1 and US$41 million
loans of DecembeFrT, 1966; Closing date for Loans 475 and 476:
June 30, 1973; Closing date for Loan 477: December 31, 1973.
These power distribution projects had a slow start but after
administrative reorganization in 1970 they gained momentum.
Procurement for the projects has been completed and all equip-
ment will be delivered by middle-1973. Most of the overhead
distribution system has been completed; construction work on
transmission lines, substations and underground distribution
systems will extend into 1973. The original closing dates
were December 31, 1970, postponed to December 31, 1973.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-

them.  They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weakness in project execution.

Loan No.
516       Livestock Pro ect:  US$40 million loan of September 23, 1967;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973. After initial delays due
to marketing and organizational difficulties, the livestock
credit program has been proceeding at a satisfactory rate.
Some problems arose in early 1972 with respect to the calcu-
lation of interest on indexed principal amounts during the
grace period but these have now been settled. The loan is
fully committed and disbursements are expected to be completed
by the closing date, December 31, 1973.
565       Porto Colombia Hydroelectric Project:   US$22.3 million loan  of
October 23, 1960; Closing Date: March 31, 1975. Changes in
the project layout and design have increased substantially the
local cost, which will be covered by ELETROBRAS. Construction
work is well advanced and the project is likely to be completed
on schedule.
566       Volta Grande Hydroelectric Project:   US$26.6 million loan of
October 23, 1960; Closing Date: January 31, 1975. The project
was delayed six months by spillway foundation difficulties.
Powerhouse construction cost estimates have increased by 72 per-
cent due to additional work resulting from foundation difficulties
and price escalation greater than estimated but, as the original
cost was very low, the resulting cost per W'h is still attractive.
No financial difficulty is expected for the company as a result
of the overruns. The project is now two-thirds completed and the
first generating unit is expected to be in operation in February
1974.
567       First Highway Construction Project:   US$26 million loan of
October 23, 1965; Closing Date: March 31, 1973. The First
Highway Construction project is completed at a cost slightly
below estimates. The closing date for the loan was postponed
from December 31, 1972, to March 31, 1973, but the Govermment
has yet to submit its final, small disbursement request. The
Government has proposed several related additions to the project
which would utilize the expected unexpended loan balance of about
US$3.1 million. The proposals are now being considered in the
Bank.
656       Industry:  US$25 million of February 16, 1970 to Banco do
Nordeste do Brasil (BNB); Closing Date: June 30, 1974.
Commitments of the loan by BNB have continued to be slow.
About half of the loan has now been committed, and the closing
date for submission for sub-projects, which was postponed a
year to June 30, 1973, may be postponed a second time to give
BNB an opportunity to submit sub-projects in an advanced stage
of preparation. Slow utilization of the loan has been due

mainly to BNB's unusually burdensome security conditions on
subloans and its emphasis on larger-scale projects, for which
financing from other than World Bank funds has been available.
BNB has not been responsive to Bank encouragement to modify
these policies.
676       Second Highway Construction Project:   US$100 million loan of
May_25, 1970; Closing Date: July 31, 1974. Construction
works are well underway and the overall quality of constructi!on
and supervision is satisfactory. There have been cost increases
on and delays in the execution of several contracts due to
inclement weather and design changes, but the total project cost
is still estimated to be within the appraisal estimate includ-
ing contingencies, and it is expected that all construction
works will be completed before the closing date for the loan.
Disbursements under the loan are slightly behind the appraisal
schedule due to the above delays, but have improved during the
last year.
677       Marimbondo Hydroelectric Project:   US$70 million loan of
April 5, 1971; Closing Date:   May 31, 1977.  Constructlon
work is proceeding on schedule. The cost of increased exca-
vation and concrete work resulting from poor rock foundation
is expected to be mostly offset by a reduction in earth fill
work. A US$26 miLlion overrun, caused by equipment prices
higher than estimated and additional transmission facilities,
was covered by a loan from a commercial bank.
728       Salto Osorio Hydroelectric Project:   US$70 million loan of
April 5, 1971; Closing Date: May 31, 1977. The construction
o the Salto Osorio hydroelectric plant is progressing satis-
factorily and no cost overrun is foreseen at this time.
The construction of the transmission system -- delayed to
allow a reexamination of ELETROSUL's market in light of
revised demand projections in the South of Brazil, possible
new power sales in the Southeast region and the addition of
heretofore unscheduled generating capacity -- is now about
to proceed as originally defined. The Government has
decided to revise the timing and scope of other generation
additions in the South and Southeast, and the Congress is
considering recently submitted legislation requiring the
updating of long-term plans for the integrated development
of generation and major transmission systems for each region.

755       Education Project:  US$8.L millicn loan of June 21, 1971;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1975.   Progress on the constructior
and equipment of the project schools is proceeding in accordance
with the revised schedule agreed upon in September 1972.
756       Santos Port Project:  US$45 million loan of June 21, 1971;
Closing Date:  September 30, 1976.   The overall port investment
program at Santos was recently expanded to accomodate increased
exports under the Government's "export corridors" program. Cost
estimates for the Bank-financed project increased from US$78.5
million to US$108.1 million, reflecting worse-than-foreseen soil
and construction conditions, higher than initially estimated
costs for completing new railway connections, and Bank-approved
increases in the size of project dredging equipment and the corn
silo. Review of the scope and economic justification of the
project by the Bank and the Borrower has tentatively identified
areas in which major savings in project costs may be achieved.
Preparation of tender documents is nearing completion but,
pending completion of the above review, tenders for civil works
and equipment for the corn and container terminals and rail
access thereto, have not been asked. Satisfactory progress,
assisted by management consultants, has been made in improving
port operations at Santos. However, the plan being prepared
for the reorganization of the National Department of Ports and
Navigable Waterways does not yet provide satisfactory solutions
to the problems of low salary scales, and the Bank has recommended
the final plan be modified. The consulting contract for the
National Port Development Study was awarded in May 1973.
757       Sao Paulo Water Supply Project:   US$22 million loan of
June 21, 1971 Closing Date: June 30, 1975. The project
suffered initial delays caused by the State of Sao Paulo not
furnishing the required counterpart funds. The required funds
are now included in the state budget and the project is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily.
758       Sao Paulo Pollution Control Project:   US$15 million loan of
June 21, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1975. The original project
design included the pumping of untreated sewage into an area reser-
voir representing a major source of water and serving as an impor-
tant recreational facility for the Sao Paulo area. Earlier studies
had shown that the reservoir could absorb the organic pollution
without damage for some time. Area residents, however, objected to
this solution and subsequent technical review questioned the initial
judgment that no ecological harm would be caused. As a resul' the
original design is being modified to exclude the discharge of raw
sewage and include a treatment facility. BLdding procedures are in
progress for other portions of the project.

786       Railway Project - MHR:   USS46 million loan of August 25, 1971;
Closing Date:  Septemiber 30, 1975.  A delay of about six months
occurred in awarding the contracts for constructing the new rail-
way link for the MBR iron ore mine due to engineering problems
encountered and inadequate project management by the Federal
Railways. Work on site is now proceeding at a rapid pace, and
much of the lost time is being regained such that the project
should be sufficiently coTmpleted to allow new ore traffic to
commence by, or soon after, the planned completion date of
July 1, 1973.
787       MBR Iron Ore Project:   US$50 million loan of August 25, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976. The estimated cost of the
project has increased due to major design changes for the port
terminal and several investment additions to the project. A
new financing plan has been agreed with the Borrower and target
completion dates at the mine and terminal should be met.
797       CSN Steel Expansion Project:   US$64.5 million loan of
February b, 1972; Closing Date: July 1, 1976. The loan became
effective on August 31, 1972, and the project is proceeding
according to schedule.
812       USIMINAS Steel Expansion Project:   US$63 million loan of
April 11, 1972; Closing Date: June 1, 1970. The loan became
effective on July 2b, 1972, and the project is proceeding
according to schedu:le.
813       Third Highway Construction Project:   US$89 million loan of
April 11  1972; Closing Date:   June 30, 1976.  The loan became
effective on December X, 1972, and the project is proceeding
according to schedule.
828       COSIPA Steel Expansion Project: US$646 million loan of
June 14, 1972, Closing Date: January 15, 1977. The loan
became effective on October 5, 1972, and the project is
proceeding according to schedule.
829       Sao Simao Hydroelectric Project:   US$60 million loan of
June 1, 1972; Closing Date:  September 30, 1979.   The project
is just getting underway. The contract for the civil works was
awarded to an Italian-Brazilian consortium in May 1973.
853       Alto Turi Land Settlement Project:   US$6.7 million loan of
July 24, 1972; Closing Date: December 1, 197B. The loan became
effective on Februaryv 15, 1973, and the project is slightly be-
hind schedule.  A Hank supervision mission is scheduled to visit
the project in the near future and review the causes of delay.

August 1h, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976. The loan
became effective on March 29, 1973, and the project is pro-
ceeding slightly behind schedule after slow work starts by
several construction contractors.
857       Grain Storage Project:   US$30 million loan of September 27, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979. The loan became effective on
January 16, 1973, and the Banco do Brasil is processing the
initial subloan applications.
