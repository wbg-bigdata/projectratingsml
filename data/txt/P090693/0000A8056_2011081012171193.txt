                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation progress remains behind schedule, but the PDO is relevant and achievable. Nineteen subgrants (valued at $2.5 million) have been signed which will help
                         strengthen the capacity of key agencies and other stakeholders to better manage environmental and social issues associated with the sustainable use of natural resources.
                         Subgrants are focusing on three key areas: environmental and social management policy implementation support; management of Protected Areas; and capacity building of the
                         Environmental Protection Fund (EPF). For policy implementation support, eleven sub-grants are supporting the development and implementation of several decrees to enhance
                         effectiveness of natural resources and environmental management in Lao PDR. High priority is given to the implementation of decrees on Environmental Impact Assessment,
                         Resettlement and Compensation, and River Basin Organization. Other sub-grants are supporting capacity building for the Water Resources and Environmental Administration

                         of a community conservation network at village level. Finally, the subgrants are also strengthening capacity of the Environment Protection Fund (EPF) in portfolio management,
                         fiduciary monitoring, planning and fund mobilizing, and are providing technical advice. The project is also supporting the implementation of the National Policy on Environment and
                         Social Sustainability in Hydropower Sector (NPSH), but the follow-up activities will be implemented under a separate Bank project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The client should focus on capacity development at the local level to monitor compliance with Environmental Compliance Certificates to ensure that environmental and social
                         management issues are well addressed at all infrastructure development activities, particularly along the hydro and mining projects.

                         The EPF has developed a 5-year strategy plan but its approval is still being discussed by its Board of Directors. The EPF will need adequate budgetary support to carry out its
                         mandate.
