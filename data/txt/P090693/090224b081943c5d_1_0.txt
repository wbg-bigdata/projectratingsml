                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is on the way to achieve its Project Development Objective (PDO) as demonstrated by the progress towards meeting the key PDO outcome targets. Current records
                         suggest that of four Environmental Compliance Certificates (ECC) issued since June 2010 for hydropower project construction have signed their Concession Agreements (CA), all
                         four have incorporated the Social and Environment Standard Obligation (SESO). However, number of new hydropower projects are being proposed, therefore the final assessment of
                         the achievement of this project outcome will be carried out by the task team during the last project completion mission planned in May 2013. For the grievance mechanism
                         performance, current records suggest that 96 percent of complaints have been resolved in Bolikhamxay, and 100% in Khammouane province.

                         However, the rating of the PDO remains Moderately Satisfactory due to the uncertainty of the sustainability of the Environmental Protection Fund (EPF) and it becoming an eligible
                         entity for receiving the NT2 revenue.

                         Project implementation is advancing, and 84% of project sub-grants will be fully disbursed by the end of December 2012, with the remaining three extended until the end of project in

                         June 2013. The final project completion report (PCR) that is currently being prepared and will be based on the completed sub-grants will highlight the key issues such as the
                         importance of the sub-grants, implementation experience, lessons learned and recommendation for future similar projects. Most of the Ministry of Natural Resources and
                         Environmental Protection junior consultants (41 out of 74) who were supported by the project have now been recruited in the government positions and receive government salary
                         since October 2012.
