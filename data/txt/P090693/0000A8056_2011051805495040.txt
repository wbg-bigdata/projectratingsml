                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation progress is somewhat behind schedule, but the PDO remains very relevant and achievable. Nine subgrants have been signed which will help strengthen the
                         management of environmental and social issues associated with sustainable use of natural resources. Sub-grants are divided into three key areas: policy implementation;
                         management of Protected Areas; and capacity building of the Environmental Protection Fund (EPF). For policy implementation, newly signed sub-grants will support implementation
                         of several important decrees on Environmental Impact Assessment, resettlement and compensation, and river basin organization. Other subgrants will support capacity building for
                         the Water Resources and Environmental Administration, and implementation of the provincial environment strategy action plan in three provinces. The sub-grants will support
                         provincial authorities and local communities in managing National and Provincial Protected Areas and will support livelihood development and establish a conservation network at

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         As LEnS additional financing has been declared its effectiveness on April 21, 2010; the approval and signed of project subgrants is considering somehow delayed by client, ranged
                         from 3-4 months from the planned date (May 2010), however, it is anticipated that the implementation of most subgrants could be accelerated since all necessary arrangement has
                         been put in place and most of the subgrantees are previously experienced with the Bank procedure.

                         EPF sustainability issue was discussed; approval of the draft 5-year strategy has been delayed. In the strategy, EPF plan to request for more government contribution by adding fund
                         (about $2-3 million) to the EPF’s endowment. The issue related to EPF sustainability has been discussed within the Bank and it may be necessary to review national and
                         international experience to justify the usefulness of semi-autonomous mechanism under the present development context. The review was somehow delayed, as there was no similar
                         mechanism has been found so far as the best practice.

                         The window management unit (WMU) has provided a progress report of project in quarterly basic; the first draft M&E report just produce and comment had provided by the TT. The
                         report will only be finalized for next mission in late April 2011.
