                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has substantially contributed to the establishment and operation of the new MoNRE including institutional set up(support has been provided for the operation of the
                         Cabinet Office, Department of Environmental Impact Assessment, Department ofEnvironment, Department of Forest Resources Management, and the Nam Theun Nam Kading River
                         Basin Organization), and implementationof decrees (Resettlement and Compensation, Environmental Impact Assessment, and River Basin Committee Decrees). The project
                         alsosupports MoNRE through the subgrant which aims to strengthen the coordination and cooperation function, and develop Land Policywhich will be presented at next National
                         Assembly meeting at the end of 2012. The mandate, organization, and staffing of the newministry however are yet to be finalized. In this context, implementation of four of the five
                         MoNRE subgrants is somewhat behindthe schedule due to the need to adjust the work plans in line with MoNRE’s mandate and priorities. However, the delay of thesesubgrants
