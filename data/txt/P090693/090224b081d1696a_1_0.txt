                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank is currently carrying out an identification mission of the Environmental and Natural Resources Management (ENRM) or LEnS II project. It is intended that sub-grants
                         supported under LEnS additional financing (LAF), both at national and provincial levels, will be continued under the LEnS II project. The LEnS II would also continue support
                         Environmental Protection Fund (EPF) for capacity building, particularly, the technical capacity to monitor their sub-grants; and sustainability of the EPF. Based on LEnS experience,
                         the LEnS II will cover three existing and extend to other six new provinces in the country.
