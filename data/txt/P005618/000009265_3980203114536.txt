REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FIRST URBAN SEWERAGE PROJECT
LOAN 1088-TUN
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This report reviews the preparation, implementation and achievements
of an Urban Sewerage Project, for which a loan of US$ 28.0 million was made to
the Republic of Tunisia. The Loan was signed in February 1975, became effec-
tive in August 1975 and the loan account was closed in December 1982. The
main implementing agency for the project was the national sewerage authority,
Office National de l'Assainissetnent (ONAS).
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Europe, Middle East
and North Africa Region Office on the basis of the findings of a project com-
pletion m.ission which visited Tunisia in January 1983, and of a review of the
President's Report, the Loan and Project Agreements and other reports related
to project implementation.
The project has not been subjected to an audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department.
Following standard OED procedures, copLes of the Project Completion
Report were sent to the Borrower for comments.  In a letter dated November 11,
1983, ONAS commented. Those comments have been taken into account in finaliz-
ing the report and the letter is reproduced in Annex 10.

REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FIRST URBAN SEWERAGE PROJECT
LOAN 1088-TUN
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The Bank Group had been involved in the Tunisian sewerage sector
through the Tourism Infrastructure Project partly financed by Loan 858-TUN and
Credit 329-TUN of February 28, 1972.
Loan 1088-TUN, approved in January 1975 for an amount of US$ 28.0
million, was the Bank's first free-standing loan to the Tunisian sewerage sec-
tor. Subsequently, Loan 1675-TUN for US$ 26.5 million and Loan 2255-TUN for
US$ 34.0 million, were made in April 1979 and March 1983, respectively. In
all three cases the Republic of Tunisia was the borrower and Office National
de l'Assainissement (ONAS) the main executing agency.
Loan 1088-TUN was expected to finance about half of the foreign
exchange requirements of the project, and about 33% of the total project cost
of US$ 86.1 million.
The principal objectives of the project were;
(a) the establishment of a national sewerage authority;
(b) the improvement and expansion of the sewerage facilities of Greater
Tunis; and
(c)  the protection of the Lake of Tunis against pollution from stormwater
overflows.
The Loan became effective with only slight delay (para. 3.01). Pro-
ject start-up and implementation, however, proceeded much more slowly than
anticipated at appraisal because (i) it took ONAS much longer than foreseen to
put together an effective team of technicians (para. 3.02); (ii) the project
had been appraised on the basis of feasibility studies and difficulties were
revealed when final engineering designs were prepared (para. 3.03); and (iii)
cost overruns caused revisions to the project scope (para. 3.03). The project
was completed about three years later than forecast (para. 3.02). Loan dis-
bursernents were similarly affected (para. 3.11).
Total project costs amounted to TD 45.5 million as compared with
appraisal estimates of TD 34.2 million, adjusted to reflect project revisions.
The cost overruns were met by Government equity contributions. Price escala-
tions due to late implementation accounted for over 40% of the cost overruns



- vi -
(para. 3.12). Changes in scope, and unforeseen implementation difficulties
accounted for the remainder (para. 3.13).
ONAS' overall financial position has been sound (para. 4.06). Its
present organization works well (para. 5.01) and its current staffing level is
acceptable (para. 5.02). During the period 1975-78 ONAS' accounting was sub-
ject to serious deficiencies (para. 5.05), but these have since been overcome
(para. 5.06).
The project was successful in all major aspects. The project objec-
tives have been met (paras. 7.01 tnrough 7.04). The rate of return is 20.2%
as compared with 24.9% estimated at appraisal (para. 7.05).
The project confirms the importance of adequate project preparation
(para. 8.02) and the need to allow sufficient time in project implementation
schedules for the establishment of a new entity (para. 8.03).

REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FIRST URBAN SEWERAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 1088-TUN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTROnUCTION
1.nl     Between 196n and 1q74 the number of Tunisian municipalities with
sewterage svstems had increased from 4 to 20, hut these systems were incom-
nlete, overloaded and hadly maintained, if at all. The eight existing sewage
treatment plants were either overloaded, malfunctioning or out of service.
The prime responsibility for the provision of sewage services had been with
the municipalities which lacked the funds and the trained personnel to provide
the necessary service. The lack of clear division of responsibility among the
ministries, the municipalities and several state agencies had hampered the
decision-making process at the national level. The only effective measures
undertaken before 1974 had been in the tourist zones as part of the tourism
infrastructure project financed partly by Bank Loan 858-TUN and Development
Credit 329-TbR of Februarv 28, 1q72.
1.02     In Great2r Tunis, where in 1974 about 75% of the population was
served yv seweraRe systems, conditiors had been far from adequate. The
deficiencies of the systems were evidlenced in summer when foul odors emanated
from the Lake of Tunis and some of the older parts of the city and in winter -
the rainv s?ason - when sewers overflowed and sewage stagnated in the low-
lying central area of the city. Finally, in some of the low income areas,
sewer svstews had been inadequate or non-existent.
1.03     The First Sewerage Project, for which Loan 1088-TUN was approved in
Tanuarv 1975, was part of the Government's program under its Fourth Plan to
establish a national sewerage authority, to improve and extend sewerage
services nationallv starting with those in the Greater Tunis Area, to develop
the sewerage infrastructure for the Greater Tunis Area and to develop the Lake
of Tunis area.
1.04     The First Sewerage Project was frillowed by the Second Sewerage Pro-
iect for which Loan 1675-TITN was approved in April 1979 and which included a
second stage of development of the sewerage infrastructure for Greater Ttunis,
a sewerage component for Sfax, and further assistance to strengthen the pro-
iect planning and control capability of ONAS. A third loan of US$ 34 million
for a project for sewerage in 30 smaller cities and towns of Tunisia was
approved in March 1983 (Loan 2255-TUN).

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAIL
Origin, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01     The Bank had been active in the water supply sector since 1967 and,
through a number of projects, had maintained a close dialogue with Tunisian
officials on sewerage as well as water supply policies and operations. The
Bank mission, which visitdd Tunisia in September 1973, reviewed the feasibi-
lity study reports prepared by consulLants and reached agreement on the scope
of the project and nn basic design criteria. The appraisal was initiated in
May 1974. The key issues were the establishment of a national sewerage entity
and the adoption of appropriate sector financial policies. These issues were
vesolved expeditiously. ONAS was created by law No. 73-74 of August 1974 and
financial policies acceptable to the Bank, the Government and ONAS were agreedl
at negotiations.
Negotiations-and Approval
2.02     The Loan was negotiated i.i December 1974, approved in January 1975
and signed in February 1975.
Major Objectives of the Project
2.03     The major project objectives were;
(a) the establishment of a national sewerage authority;
(b) the improvement and expansion of the sewerage facilities of Greater
Tunis; and
(c) the protection of the Lake of Tunis against pollution from stormwater
overflows.
Project Description
2.04     The project consisted of:
(a) the establishment of ONAS, includings
(i) training of ONAS staff and assistance on personnel administra-
tion and training;
(ii) assistance in accounting and standard engineering practices;
(iii) purchase of operation and maintenance equipment for ONAS'
facilities and training of operators for this equipment; and
(iv) purchase of office equipment including calculators, drafting
equipment and furniture;



(b) expansion of the trunk sewer system in the Tunis district including
construction and installation of gravity sewers and pumping stations
over a total length of about 60 km;
(c) renovation and renewal of existing sewers in the district and renova-
tion and renewal where urgently needed of sewer systems in communi-
ties outside the district, for a total of about 75 km;
(d) renovation and increase in capacity of the Cherguia treatment plant
and the construction of new plants on sites north of Tunis and at
South Miliane, serving populations equivalent to about 160,000 and
500,000 person£.. respectively;
(e) extensions to the sewer system to serve built-up areas without
service (about 90 km);
(f) construction of stormwater evacuation channels totalling about 7 km
in the Tunis area and of two lift stations to pump stormwater into
the navigation canal in the Lake of Tunis;
(g) feasibility studies of sewerage projects to be included in Tunisia's
Fifth Plan;
(h) preparation of detailed land use studies and establishment of "Plans
d'Am6lnagement" for the Lake of Tunis area; and
(i) a study of the Tunisian construction industry to determine means of
increasing its capacity and an associated training program.
Special Conditions
2.05     Special conditions were specified in the legal agreements, as follows:
(ai the Government would provide ONAS with funds to finance the installa-
tion of house sewerage connections and extensions of low income cus-
tomers (Loan Agreement Section 3.01(c)(iii) and Project Agreement
Section 2.08(b)). Such financing has been provided;
(b) the Government would acquire all non-built-up land around the Lake of
Tunis (Loan Agreement, Section 3.04(c)(ii)). Acquisition is underway
(para. 3.07);
(c) the Government would provide ONAS with operating subsidies (Loan
Agreement Section 4.02). These subsidies have been provided;
(d) ONAS would establish a training unit (PJoject Agreement, Section
3.01(c)). This has been done;
(e) ONAS would employ consultants to assist in the establishment of ONAS,
the preparation of bidding documents, the supervision of construc-
tion, and the preparation of the feaniibility studies for sewerage
projects to be included in Tunisia's Fifth Plan (Project Agreement,
Section 2.02). Such consultants were employed;



- 4 -
(f) ONAS would set tariffs at leveli sufficient to provide from internal
sources funds equivalent to at least 4% of the net value of its fixed
assets including work in progress (Project Agreement, Section 4.04).
This requirement 1.as been met;
(g) ONAS would not incur debt unless its net revenues are not less than
1.5 times maximum future debt service (Project Agreement, Section
4.05(a)). ONAS has had no difficult-y operating within the bounds of
this covenant;
(h) ONAS would inventory all assets acquired from the Governrment and
value them within two years of take-over (Project Agreement, Section
4.06(a)). This is in progress; and
(i) the District of Tunis would employ consultants to assist in the
preparation of land use studies and plans (Project Agreement, Section
2.02). Consultants were employed.



III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
Effectiveness
3.01     Special conditions of effectiveness included, inter alia:
(a) the promulgation of a decree enabling ONAS to operate in the District
of Tunis and in the tourism zones;
(b) the implementation of a tariff schedule; and
(c) the promulgation of a personnel statute for the employees of the
District of Tunis and the issuance of a circular defining more
precisely the role of the District.
Meeting these conditions took about two more months than anticipated at nego-
tiations. The Loan was declared effective on August 15, 1975.
Implementation of Physical Components
3.02     Implementation of the physical project components (para. 2.04 (b),
(c), (d), (e) and (f)) should have been completed by the end of 1978, while in
fact all but one were completed after this date and the last component was
finished in July 1982. Implementation slippage occurred because of the execu-
tion of complementary engineering studies to increase the reliability of the
different waste water treatment systems and to take account of the relocation
of the North Lake Canal. Implementation slippage was also due to delays in
the establishment of ONAS, which at first had difficulties in recruiting
qualified personnel. It appears that the time required for ONAS to become
fully operative was seriously underestimated. It also appears that the
assumption that the bulk of the construction would be underway in 1975 (SAR
Annex 8) was overoptimistic considering that ONAS could not have been assumed
to start operations much before January 1975 and that loan effectiveness had
been set for June 1975. Implementation slippage was also due to the fact that
evaluation of bids, decision of award and signing of the contracts generally
required more time than originally anticipated. Actual completion dates were
as follows:
Treatment plants:
- Rehabilitation of Cherguia                09.30.1980
- North coas_                               07.15.1980
- South Miliane                             03.20.1981
North Lake Canal                            10.12.1981
Monplaisir pumping station                  06.24.1981
Tunis collector system                      11.14.1981
Northern -uburbs                            12.27.197,
Western suburbs                             03.07.1979
Southern suburbs                            10.27.1981
Southern coascal area                       07.10.1982
Northern coastal area                       06.30.1980

Revisions to the Scope of the Physical Components
3.03     The project had been appraised on the basis of feasibility studies
which had been completed in January 1974. At that time there was no updated
urban development plan for Greater Tunis, such having become available only in
1977. Several adjustments were nmade during implementation by the Tunisian
authorities in consultation with the Bank. Overall, the project would cover a
greater area of urbanized and urbanizable land and more dispersed zones than
had been originally foreseen. But to contain cost overruns and for other
technical reasons revisions were made, with Bank concurrence, to the project
scope. On September 11, 1978 the Project description was amended (i) deleting
the South Lake canal and (ii) adding a stormwater evacuation channel in the
Ariana area. Furthermore, che outfalls from the Cherguia treatment plant to
the navigation channel and from the North Coast treatment plant to the sea
were replaced by a pipe and canal from these plants to the Choutrana treatment
plant to be built under the Second Sewerage Project; and the construction of
minor stormwater drains was postponed.
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.04     The engineering consultanrts who assisted ONAS in the design and
supervision of the project were competent, and the basic design criteria and
approaches which they proposed were followed. Execution delays were incurred
and changes were made to project scope mainly because, as stated in para.
3.03, at the time of appraisal only feasibility studies were ready. During.
the preparation of final designs, some components required more time than
anticipated, particularly the stormwater drainage component.
3.05     At the beginning of the project, muwt of the civil works contracts
were awarded to foreign contractors. Later on, Tunisian firms submitted bids
at very low prices and won many contracts. However, these firms were under-
taking sewerage works for the first time and had difficulty to hire qualified
personnel. ONAS encountered considerable problems and in one instance even
had to withdraw some works from one contractor and give them to another.
Implementation of the Land Use Study for the Lake of Tunis Area
3.06     The District of Tunis whichi was responsible for this studly awarded
the contract to a French firm which carried it out in a timely and satisfac-
tory manner. Subsequently, the District of Tunis submitted to the Government
and the Bank a development plan of the land affected by the project.
3.07     The area subject to redevelopment around the Lake of Tunis covered a
total of about 1,580 ha of which about 1,150 ha were Goverr"ent-owned and 430
privately-owned. The first stage of development covers about 800 ha which the
Government will contribute in kind to the capital of "5oci&t4 d'Amenagement
des Berges du Lac de Tunis", a newly created development company in which the
Government will have a 51% interest. The Company is expected to start work in
a priority zone of some 285 ha in thf second quarter of 1984.



Implementation of the Tunisian Construction Industry Study
3.08     This study was carried out by a French firm under the responsibility
of the "Centre Technique pour le Developper-it de la Construction", of the
Ministry of Equipment.  The study was compi:.ed in March 1978.  The main
recommendations were as follows:
(a) establishment of an official construction industry planning unit at
national and regional levels backed by a comprehensive information
system;
(b) establishment of a contractors association responsible for training,
statistics, planning, public relations, legal and contractual assis-
tance to member firms;
(c) establishment of an industry-wide guarantee co,,pany to facilitate
borrowing from the banking system by small firms; and
(d) improvement of payment procedures by public authorities to assist the
cash flow of the industry.
3.09     The study was very useful in raising the general level of conscious-
ness with regards to the opportunities and probiems faced by the construction
industry. Although no clear link can be established between the study and the
increased capacity of the industry, it is interesting to note that the
registry of the Ministry of Equipment shows that since 1978 the size of con-
tracts on which firms may bid has increased for over 50% of the firms listed.
Although the study's recommendations for the most part were not implemented,
the Government has indicated its intention to institute a plan of action for
the establishment of an information and planning system and is requesting Bank
assistance to set up a planning unit for the construction sector. Training
continues to be the responsibility of "l'Office des Travailleurs Tunisiens a
l'Etranger, de l'Emploi et de la Formation Professionnelle" (OTTEEFP). Local
banks strongly opposed the creation of a guarantee company to provide services
which they felt they have been providing. Finally, the question of the pay-
ment procedures of public auchorities is being reviewed by the Government.
Procurement
3.10     All goods and services (other than the services of consultants)
required for the project were procured on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for procurement.  ONAS
had no difficulty in complying with these guidelines and procurement was
accomplished in a satisfactory manner.
Disbursements
3.11     Because of the implementation delays noted in para. 3.02, actual
disbursements lagged considerably behind the appraisal estimate. This esti-
mate foresaw disbursement of 18% of the loan in the first year, when actually
no disbursement took place. In all, it took seven and one half years to dis-
burse the loan instead of five as originally forecast. Annex 1 provides a
comparison of actual and forecast disbursements.



-8-
Project Costs
3.12     Actual costs amounted to TD 45.5 million as compared with appraisal
estimates of TD 34.2 million, adjusted to reflect the project revisions noted
in para. 3.03 (a), (b) and (c). Detailed cost comparison appears in Annex 2.
This cost overrun was met by Government equity contributions. It is estinated
that of the total net increase of TD 11.2 million, about TD 4.7 million is the
result of higher prices due to the fact that roughly 80% of the project was
completed after the original completion date of December 1978.
3.13     The remainder of the cost overrun is due to a mix of factors includ-
ing a greater length of sewers and a higher number of pumping stations
installed. The major cost variations occurred in the following components:
(a) the City of Tunis' Monplaisir sewerage works which cost TD 4.5
million vs TD 0.9 million at appraisal. A total capacity of
22,400 m3/h was installed/rehabilitated as compared with an origi-
nal 17,000 m3/h; an 800 KVA power station not foreseen at the time
of appraisal was also installed;
(b) the Southern coastal zonie sewerage works which cost TD 2.7 million vs
TD 1.4 million. A total of 19 km of sewers and 4 stations were
installed instead of 4.6 km and 2 stations in order to serve an
additional population zone as well as an industrial zone not foreseen
at the time of the feasibility study; and
(c) the City of Tunis' north storm drainage canal which cost TD 7.0 mil-
lion vs TD 2.0 million. The feasibility study foresaw a canal with a
length of 4.5 km with a capacity of 10 m3/s and volume of 60,000
.3; the actual canal is 4.8 km long with a capacity of 10 m3/s
and 156,000 m3. Furthermore, a length of about 1.3 km downstream
which was to have been built on the existing embankment was eventu-
ally built in the lake following the building of a major highway.
The cost increase attributable to this change alone anounted to some
TD 2.0 million due to foundation problems and the building of a new
embankment. Moreover, a detailed study showed higher than antici-
pated runoff which led to the addition of a lock with water level
control mechanism. Then, access roads were added. Finally, an
unreckoned zone of very hard rock and the zone where the mud dredged
from the Lake of Tunis had been accumulated presented unforeseen
construction difficulties with attendant higher than anticipated
costs.

IV. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
4.01     ONAS' appraisal and actual income statements, cash flow statements
and balance sheets for the period 1975-81 appear in Annexes 3, 4 and 5.
Operating ResuLts
4.02     Tle appraisal forecast of the total volume of water sold by SONEDE,
the water s tpply company, in the period 1975-81 was remarkably accurate.
However, as a result of delays in ONAS' take-over of new systems, the volume
of water sold in ONAS' systems in 1981 was about 36% lower than forecast.  In
that year total actual revenues were only about 1% lower than forecast while
total actual expenses were 12% higher despite the fact that depreciation
charges were much lower due to fewer systems - and assets - having been taken
over by ONAS. Personnel costs increased especially rapidly and in the period
1975-81 accounted for about 37% of total expenses as compared with 26% fore-
cast at appraisal. Tlhe effect of the high rate of inflation which prevailed
in the period is readily seen in the following table:
TD Millimes
1976       1981
Average Revenues per m3
Actual                                       52.1       112.4

Average Expenses per m3
Actual                                       44.5        96.7
Appraisal                                    35.5        54.3
Financing Plan
4.03     The period 1975-81 was characterized by rapidly increasing operating
and investment costs, and was particularly trying for a newly established con-
pany. Nevertheless, with the support of the Government ONAS did a superb job
of balancing the pressures for expanded service with the limits of available
financing and the difficulty of setting realistic consumer charges.
4.04     Investments totalling TD 81.2 million (appraisal TD 78.0 million)
were financed 38% from internal cash generation and consumers' contributions
(appraisal 42%), 36% from Government contributions (appraisal 27%) and 26%
from borrowings (appraisal 31%). In the 1975-81 period the Saudi Development
Fund provided SRLS 105 million towards the financing of ONAS' investments.
Consunter Charges
4.05     ONAS maintains an array of consumer charges.  In the period 1975-81,
about 52% of these charges was linked to the volume of water consumed
(appraisal 57%), 23% to property taxes (appraisal 14%), 21% to the cost of the



- 10 -
collection systems (appraisal 23%) and 4% to other sources (appraisal 6%),
The first of these charges stems from the sewerage tariff, the evolution of
which appears in Annex 6. It will be noted that the tariff introduced in
early 1975 consisted exclusively of a surcharge per m3 of water consumed.
With the 1978 adjustment, a fixed fee was introduced. Another adjustment was
made in 1982.
Financial Covenants
4.06     ONAS met its financial covenants throughout the 1975-81 period, i.e.
it obtained a rate of return on its net fixed assets including work in pro-
gress in excess of the 4% prescribed minimum and was able to operate within
the bounds of its debt limitation covenant.
Financial Position
4.07     ONAS' overall financial position has been sound.  Its debt to equity
ratio increased gradually in the years following its establishment and stood
at a satisfactory level of 40:60 at the end of 1981. Its current ratio was
somewhat low towards the end of the period under review mainly because of an
increase in suppliers' credit. Its receivables reached the equivalent of 3.6
months of sales at the end of 1981. This stenuned from late remittance from
SONEDE wlhich does ONAS9 billing and collection. Arrangements have since been
made to settle these arrears.

V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization and Management
5.01     ONAS' organization structure appears in Annex 7.  ONAS continues to
be ruled by a Board of Directors which represents various interested min-
istries and entities. Its chairman is also the General Manager and runs the
company. At its inception three departments - Finance and Administration,
Engineering and New Works and Operations - reported to the General Manager.
Currently, four depart-ments (Planning and Studies, Operations and Maintenance,
Projects and New Works-Tunis, and Engineering and New Works-Interior) and two
divisions (Finance and Administration) report to him. The current organiza-
tion works well. However, ONAS is fast taking over responsibility for more
and more remote centers and the Government is requesting the Bank to assist in
reviewing ONAS' structure.
Personnel and Training
5.02     Annex 8 shows the evolution of ONAS' staff.  Total staff stood at
about 1,400, or 8.6 per 1,000 connections at the end of 1981. This is accept-
able for ONAS' decentralized type of operation. For 1981, the appraisal fore-
cast a total staff of 1,300 without however giving the number of connections.
5.03     A comprehensive training program has been developed by ONAS' Training
Division assisted by the Federal Republic of Germany (GTZ) and EEC training
experts and by one WHO expert placed at ONAS' disposal by the Swedish Inter-
national Development Association. Current training is considered adequate.
Between 1975 and 1982, a total of 600 employees participated in short-term
training seminars covering most aspects of ONAS' operations. These seminars
were run by OTTEEFP. A total of 40 scholarships were also pxovided for post
graduate studies (Annex 8).
Billing and Collection
5.04     Billing and collection continues to be done by SONEDE.  Except for
the delay in funds transfer mentioned in para. 4.07, this function is being
performed efficiently.
Accounting
5.05     During the period 1975-77, the preparation of accounts was subject to
increasing delays and the backlog of work had increased to such an extent that
it had become impossible to determine the results of one year before the end
of the next. Audit reports covering this period revealed weaknesses in
internal control and erroneous records, a situation caused mainly by staff
constraints and lack of training. The Bank's emphasis on remedial action was
followed by various measures including the reorganization of the Finance and
Administration Department which was broken up into two Divisions one for
finance and one for administration. Additional staff was recruited and a
consulting firm was hired under the project to assist ONAS in progressively



- 12 -
computerizing its accounting. Finally, ONAS' management consultants assisted
in the uperading of ONAS' accounting function through a program of interim
reviews.
9.06     From 1978 onwards, significant improvements were noted in ONAS'
accounting funtction. Its accounts, inventorv control and payroll have been
computerized and transactions recorded properly. HTowever, in order to monitor
costs more effectivelv, ONAS is introducing a more sophisticated computer-
based svstem. When fully operational in mid-1983, the system will provide
cost information bv region, branch and project.
Audits
9.07     Because of delavs in the preparation of accounts (para. 5.05), audit
reports for 1976-78 reached the Bank with considerable delays. Such delays,
however, have been gradually reduced, and the audit for 1982 is expected
before June 30, 1983. Audit reports have been comprehensive and valuable to
ONAS and the Bank. The only recent observation of the auditors concerns the
fact that ONAS has not completed the valuation of all its fixed assets. This
is bound to happen each time ONAS assumes responsibility for the sewerage
facilities of a new urban center. Section 4.06(a) of the Project Agreement
stipulated that ONAS will inventory and value all assets acquired from Govern-
ment within two years of take-over (para. 2.05(h)).
Management Consultants' Performance
5.n0     The management consultants which were employed to develop ONAS'
original organizational chart were also instrumental in ONAS' developing into
a well managed organization. The same consultants were subsequently employed
to assist ONAS in improving and computerizing its accounting procedures and in
preparing the tariff studies which led to the tariff increases of 1978 and
1982. In addition, the collaboration between ONAS and these consultants was
good and ONAS' staff gained experience by working with them.



- 13 -
VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
6.01     The Bank was instrumental in the creation of ONAS, and has continued
to assist in its development.
6.02     The project was supervised regularly at about eight-month intervals.
However, some of the missions included preparation, appraisal and supervision
of the Second Urban Sewerage Project. The missions' reports highlighted
issues in project execution and were followed by letters to ONAS urging cor-
rective actions where required.
6.03     The Bank was flexible in agreeing to modifications in the project
scope. During the preparation of the Second Urban Sewerage Project it even
initiated the discussions which led to one of the major changes. This change
called for treated effluents to be pumped from the Cherguia treatment plant to
the existing Khelidj Canal instead of being discharged into the North Lake
Canal, and for the expensive sea outfall of the North Coast treatment plant to
be replaced by a much cheaper canal from the treatment plant to the Khelidj
Canal. With these modifications, treated sewage will no longer be discharged
into urbanized or touristic areas and will be readily available for irrigation.



- 14 -
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Institutional Aspects
7.01     The greatest development i*pact of the project has been the estab-
lishment of ONAS which was created in August 1974 between the time of apprais-
al and negotiation. At first, ONAS had difficulLy in recruiting qualified
personnel, but this was gradually overcome. It took about two years for its
technical departments to become fully operative. This was a remarkable
achievement. Development of its accounting function, however, trailed behind
until about the end of 1977. Since then enough progress has been made for
ONAS to be counted among well-run organizations.
Improvement to Greater Tunis Sewerage System
7.02     In the center of Tunis, the recalibration of the main trunk sewers
and the rehabilitation and expansion of the Monplaisir pumping station carried
out under the project have largely stopped overflows in the streets and dis-
charges into the Lake of Tunis. The second sewerage project (Loan 1675-TUN)
which is underway will further expand the existing network and consolidate the
results achieved under the first project.
7.03     As a result of the project, the wastewaters of the eastern and
southern suburbs of Tunis are now treated. The second sewerage project men-
tioned earlier will also provide treatment facilities for the northern suburb
to complement the existing plant. The treated effluents of these plants will
be used for irrigation, which is very important in a country with limited
water resources. It is estimated that some 17 million m3 in 1983 and 27
million m3 by 1997 would be available for irrigation. The Government
already has an irrigation project under implementation in several areas cover-
ing a total of about 4,450 ha.
Pollution Control of the Lake of Tunis
7.04     The Lake of Tunis is divided into a northern and a southern axrea by a
navigation canal. As pointed out in para. 3.03, because of cost overruno,
protection infrastructure was provided only for the northern area of the Lake.
Improvements in this area have been spectacular. Earlier analyses of the Lake
waters had shown very high BOD5 counts and excessive levels of nitrogen and
phosphorus as well as a virtual lack of oxygen.  Similar analyses made in
March 1982 showed satisfactory levels. Not surprisingly, the water is rnow
clear, odors have disappeared and the tonnage of fish caught is increasing
after years of rapid decrease.
Internal Rate of Return
7.05     For analysis purposes, the appraisal had separated the project's
elements, other than the studies and technical assistance, into those for



- 15 -
sewage collection/evacuation, including secondary and tertiary networks and
those for pollution control including main sewer t.unks, treatment plants and
treated sewage outfalls. A rate of return had only been calculated for the
pollution control infrastructure because the cost and benefits of sewage col-
lection could not be evaluated separately from those of water supply. This
would involve difficult judgements and would not yield meaningful results
because, inter alia, (i) the water supply works for Tunis also serve other
centers and (ii) the tariffs for sewerage generate revenues from consumers
already connected to the system and are not necessarily related to the
improved service received. The same methodology was followed in this report.
7.06     The rate of return for the pollution control infrastructure is esti-
mated at 20.2% (appraisal 24.9%). Sensitivity analysis shows the rate would
still exceed 10% if future costs increased by 60% (appraisal 50%) or if the
benefits from appreciation in land value dropped by 33% (appraisal 45%).
Annex 9 provides details on how this rate was obtained.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
Conclusions
8.01     The project was successful in all major aspects:
(a) the national sewerage authority created in August 1974 has developed
into a financially sound (para. 4.06) and well-run organization
(para. 7.01);
(b) the infrastructure provided performs as expected; the effects on the
City and the Lake of Tunis are impressive (paras. 7.02 to 7.04); and
(c) a company, owned 51% by Government, is proceeding with plans to
urbanize the priority zone on the shores of the Lake of Tunis (para.
3.07).
Lessons Learned
8.02     This project confirms the importance of adequate project preparation.
The project was appraised on the basis of feasibility studies and without an
updated urban development plan for Greater Tunis. This resulted in revisions
to the project scope during implementation (para. 3.03).
8.03     It took longer than assumed at appraisal for ONAS' technical depart-
ments to become fully operative (para. 3.02). ONAS' ability to hire qualified
personnel in its very early stage of operation was overestimated (para. 7.01).
With hindsight, it appears the time required for the establishment of ONAS
might have been reflected more realistically in the project implementation
schedule.

FIRST URBAN SEWERAGE PROJECT

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
1.       The economic analysis covers the period 1975 through 2014.  Costs and
benefits are detailed on page 3 of this annex.
Incremental Costs
2.       Costs include the costs net of taxes and duties of actual and future
investments and ONAS' incremental operating and maintenance expenses related
to the pollution control elements of the project.
Incremental Benefits
3.       Benefits consist of the appreciation in the value of the land sur-
rounding the Lake of Tunis, the increased value of commercial fish production
and the value of treated wastewater for irrigation and sludge for fertilizer.
4.       Although the entire city of Tunis has benefited from the clean-up of
the Lake and of the beaches of the Gulf of Tunis it is not possible to sepa-
rate and quantify the effects of the project from other factors to determine
the increase in property value which took place in Tunis and would be related
to the project without a very detailed and costly study. The benefits relat-
ing to increased property values have been calculated for a strip of 1,500 ha
immediately surrounding the Lake. The study concerning the use of this strip
of land estimated that 25% of this land would be used for streets and other
uses and that the remaining 1,125 ha could be sold for TD 18/m2 after
installation of basic services estimated to cost TD 6.6/m2. This tract of
land was estimated to have a current value of TD 3/m2. The area around the
Lake represents about 7% of the Greater Tunis area. The demand elasticity has
been estimated to be minus one over the period, resulting in a 7% reduction in
the price of land. The increase in land value resulting from cleaning up the
Lake would be 1,125 ha at TD 15/m2 or TD 168 million. These benefits will
be realized between 1984 and 1992.

5.       Before the project, commercial fishing yielded equal tonnage from the
northern and southern parts of the Lake of Tunis, but because of increasing
pollution, this tonnage was constantly decreasing. After the project, in
1982, the fish yield in the northern part started to go up while that of the
southern part continued to go down. The difference in fish production between
the two parts of the Lake is attributed to the project. By 1986, it is esti-
mated that the catch from the northern Lake will reach 575 T and that in the
southern part only about 25 T. Thus by 1986 about 550 T will accrue as bene-
fit to the project. At the 1982 average price of TD 1,805 per ton, this
amounts to TD 992,750 per year.
6.       Some of the treated water is sold for irrigation purposes during a
period of 5 months each year. As a result 16.9 million cubic meters were sold
in 1982 at an average price of 0.0775/m3 representing a total amount of TD
1.3 million. It is estimated that by 1997 and subsequenL years the total vol-
ume sold will be about 27.0 million cubic meters representing TD 2.1 million.
7.       Finally, sewage sludge sales have been conservatively estimated at
TD 10,000 per year throughout the period covered.
Rate of Return
8.       The rate of return for the pollution control infrastructure is esti-
mated at 20.2%. Sensitivity analysis shows that the rate would still exceed
10% if future costs increased by 60% or if the benefits from appreciation in
land value dropped by 33%.

COMMENTS BY ONAS ON PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Republic of Tunisia
Ministry of Infrastructure
Tunis, November 11, 1983
Ref. No. 15/0/i
To Mr. Shiv S. Kapur
Director, OED
Subject:    Project completion report for the First Urban Sewerage Project
(Loan 1088 - TUN).
Reference: Your letter of September 15, 1983.
OED Notes:           You have asked me to comment on the first version of the
above-mentioned report. I have no special remarks to make but I would like to
offer one or two corrections:
para. 4.04           It would be right to mention the participation of the Saudi
has been
amended.  Development Fund (loan of SRls 105 million).
As regards the delays to the project, one must remember that the
lack of basic data led to wide-ranging preliminary studies being conducted;
this was not part of the initial planning.
para. 5.03           Finally, SIDA support for training enabled a WHO expert to be made
has been
amended..  available to ONAS.
paras. 3.06          As regards land use around the perimeter of Lake Tunis, it should be
and 3.07
have       mentioned that the entire area comprising the first intervention zone
been
amended.

(about 800 ha) has become State property, with a view to its forming the
contribution in kind made to the company established for this purpose, with a
capital of D 34 million.
This company will undertake rehabilitrtion work starting in the
second half of 1984 along with the lake development work in the priority zone,
in accordance with the studies made by the District of Tunis (and not the
Arrondissement of Tunis).
para. 3.09          Aware of the difficulties of implementing the conclusions of the
has
been      important study regarding the Tunisian construction industry, my department
amended.
currently plans to ask the Eur6quip company to prepare an action plan to set
up an information and planning system.
The quality of the assistance received from the Bank over many
years, for which we can cnly be greatful, naturally leads us to envisage
further actions.
It seems to me that the Bank's assistance should take the form of
making expert advice available with a view to establishing the measures to be
taken regarding:
(1) a new organization of Sanitation Office Services, in view of the
importance of maintenance problems and of the management of new networks in
ever-larger action areas;
para. 3.09    (2)  the establishment of a planning cell in the construction sector.
has been
amended.            In conclusion it is my pleasure to express our satisfaction with the
fruitful assistance of the Bank and to confirm our desire to continue and
intensify it.
Yours etc.
