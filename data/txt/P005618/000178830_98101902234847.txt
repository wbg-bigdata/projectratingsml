INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR THE FIRST URBAN SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Tunisia for the equivalent of US$28 million to help finance
the first urban sewerage project. The loan would have a term of 25 years, in-
cluding 4 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum. Of the
proceeds of the loan, $27.7 million would be relent to the National Sewerage
Authority, on the same terms as the Bank loan.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economic Development of Tunisia - A Basic
Report" is being distributed to the Executive Directors simultaneously. An
updating economic mission visited Tunisia in November, 1974; its report is
now in preparation. The main conclusions of the basic economic and the up-
dating mission are reflected below. Country data sheets are attached (Annex I).
3.        Tunisia's development has been hampered by scarcity of natural re-
sources. Much of the country is arid or semi-arid, and agriculture is highly
dependent on rainfall. Minerals are mostly of low quality and, apart from
phosphates, limited in quantity. In the mid-1960's, petroleum was discovered
and has since become an increasingly valuable source of revenue and export
earnings. Industrial development has been handicapped by the small size of
the domestic market, as well as a lack of skills and experience. Tourism has
developed rapidly and workers' remittances have become a significant item in
the balance of payments. Per capita income increased by 4.4 percent annually
from 1961, and reached a level of $380 in 1972. Tunisia has enjoyed a large
amount of external aid and used it to expand economic and social infrastruc-
ture, broaden the industrial base, increase the rate of growth, and make
available a wide range of social and welfare services to a large part of the
population. Like most developing countries, however, it has not yet found
adequate ways to eliminate unemployment and poverty and to achieve a balanced
distribution of consumption among income groups, between urban and rural areas,
and among regions.
4.        Government strategy in the 1960's relied heavily on central plan-
ning of investment and resource allocation, with the public sector playing a
major role in production as well as providing infrastructure and services.
Foreign exchange shortages and concern with inflation led to recourse to a
pervasive system of price determination and controls. An unusually long series
of poor crop years due to shortage of rainfall slowed down growth of output.



- 2 -
Many of the investments in public enterprises proved to be uneconomic and
private initiative in most sectors except tourism and petroleum was weak.
5.        The Government's present development strategy was introduced after
1969. Its principal objectives are (a) accelerating growth based on export-
oriented industries, by encouraging private initiative, reducing direct Govern-
ment involvement in production and relaxing administrative regulations; (b)
creating jobs, primarily in the expanding industrial sector, encouraging
worker emigration, reducing population growth and improving education and
training; and (c) maintaining internal and external financial stability. The
1973-76 Plan set a target rate of GDP growth of 7.1 percent, providing for a
5.4 percent growth rate in per capita private consumption. Investment is
projected to increase by 70 percent above the Third Plan. National savings
are to finance three-quarters of investment. Exports of goods and services
are projected to grow at 8.8 percent per year at constant prices and imports
at 12.2 percent. The Plan foresees an increase in net external capital inflows
of almost 100 percent over 1969-1972 average levels with external capital
providing 23.5 percent of total investment; the debt service ratio would be
held to below 20 percent. The original Plan targets are conservative in terms
of both growth and savings potential, and have been significantly affected by
the impact of the changed petroleum and phosphates prices on the Tunisian
economy (paras. 9 and 10).
6.        The real growth rate of GDP in the 1970's has been almost twice that
of the previous decade, averaging 8.6 percent per annum during 1970-1973 and
an estimated 11 percent in 1974. It can be attributed in part to fortuitous
factors such as good weather, leading to record cereal and olive crops, in part
to important growth in tourism, petroleum revenues and workers' remittances as
well as to the general re-orientation of Government policy since 1969, which
renewed self-confidence and initiative in the private sector. Expansion of
manufacturing and phosphate production has been significant. By 1973 GNP per
capita had reached $403 at current prices. The investment rate, which aver-
aged 24 percent of GDP in the 1960's, dropped to 21.4 percent in 1973 but re-
gained its previous level in 1974. National savings, on the other hand, rose
sharply, from an average of 13.5 percent of GDP during the 1960's to 18 percent
in 1973 and an estimated 22 percent in 1974. Consequently, the share of ex-
ternal borrowing in financing investment dropped from 44 percent in the 1960's
to 17 percent in 1973.
7.        The balance of payments has improved steadily since 1967, with the
current account deficit declining from an average of $115 million per year
in 1961-1967 to $90 million in 1973 and an estimated $55 million in 1974.
The effects of improved terms of trade on the 1974 balance of payments have
been significant. Commodity export prices (mainly petroleum, olive oil and
phosphates) rose on average by 66 percent over 1973, but were accompanied
by a rise in import prices of more than 30 percent. In addition, receipts
from services were affected by the decline of tourist activity and the slow-
down in the migration of workers to Europe. With estimated gross disbursements
on external borrowing totalling $147 million (instead of $203 million as fore-
seen in the Plan), net reserves stood at $406 million at the end of 1974,
equivalent to 4.5 months of imports.



8.        Because of price controls and Government subsidization of basic
consumer goods, and prudent fiscal and monetary policies, Tunisia has main-
tained relative price stability. Domestic price increases averaged 4.2 per-
cent between 1969 and 1973. In 1974 the official GDP deflator rose to an
estimated at 8.5 percent. However average investment costs increased by 10
percent in 1973 and by about 17 percent in 1974.
9.        In the medium-term, Tunisia is likely to be on balance a beneficiary
of the changed world economic situation. Petroleum and phosphate prices in-
creased about threefold since 1973; olive oil prices also increased substantial-
ly in 1973 and 1974. As a result, commodity export earnings are expected to
rise from $406 million in 1973 to about $930 million in 1976. On the other
hand, increases in import prices in 1974 and further increases in coming years,
combined with higher domestic demand, will cause payments on commodity imports
to grow rapidly from $594 million in 1973 to a projected $1,130 million in
1976. Thus Tunisia's gains in terms of trade are expected to disappear by
1978. Tourism earnings and workers remittances may further decline as a re-
sult of the depressed economic situation of Western Europe. The level of net
reserves is expected to stay at about 4.3 months of imports through 1976 and
subsequently to decrease to about 3 months of imports in 1980. At that time,
the balance of payments may re-emerge as a constraint on Tunisian's develop-
ment.
10.       The temporary increase in foreign exchange reserves and Government
savings, resulting from higher export prices and consequent increases in tax
revenue, does not call for a substantial revision in development strategy.
However, Tunisia should step up its efforts to achieve the investment rate
projected in the original Fourth Plan, and to realize higher growth rates and
employment creation. Since worker emigration to Europe is now limited, an
effort to increase investment, particularly in labor-intensive industry and
agriculture should be made. With an adequate savings level, the Tunisian
economy has the financial resources that should enable it to attain growth
rates ranging from 8 to 9.5 percent per annum until 1977 and thereafter from
7 to 8.5 percent. However, in the longer term, higher rates of growth would
require substantially higher external aid than in the past. The level of
future growth would also depend on Tunisia's ability to stimulate private
investment, and to plan and implement public investments.
11.       Tunisia has made impressive social gains.    By 1971, primary school
enrollment had reached 73 percent and secondary enrollment 42 percent of the
relevant age-groups. Public health services have been greatly expanded with
many provided free, and a family planning program introduced. Social expendi-
tures, both current and capital, have increased by over 9 percent per annum;
in 1974 they accounted for 11 percent of GDP and for 40 percent of total
public expenditures. Nonetheless, major social issues remain. Further progress
is needed in land reform. The unemployment rate was estimated at 18 percent in
the non-agricultural sectors in 1973, and underemployment in the rural sector
is high. There has been a growing concentration of productive activities in
a few urban areas.



-4-
12.       So far as can be judged from available data, the position of agri-
cultural workers in Tunisia worsened relative to that of other workers during
the 1960s, partly due to the series of poor harvests. However, the proportion
of the population with insufficient incomes was substantially reduced, thanks
in particular to the income re-distribution effects of free social services.
Since 1970, remarkable increases in agricultural output, a rise in workers'
remittances and a 30 percent increase in the agricultural minimum wage in
1974 have improved the absolute and possibly also the relative position of
the poorest groups.
13.       Agriculture, the dominant sector in the economy, provides nearly
half of total employment, 32 percent of merchandise exports and 19 percent of
GDP (1972-1974). Food processing industries account for another 4 percent of
GDP and over a third of value added in manufacturing. Agricultural production
jumped in recent years, largely as a result of favorable weather, and the
potential for further growth is clear. While large infrastructure investments
were made during the last decade, current policy emphasizes projects that
make a rapid and direct contribution to production and recognizes various con-
straints on agricultural development: absentee ownership and insecurity of
tenure, inadequate access to agricultural credit, the need to devote more re-
sources to extension services and agricultural education, and underutilization
of irrigation investments. Under the Fourth Plan, more than $100 million has
been allocated to a rural development program to be executed by the provincial
administrations.
14.       During the 1960's manufacturing production in Tunisia increased by
8 percent annually. There was a remarkable acceleration of growth in the 1970's
due in part to a record year for the olive oil processing industry and to the
development of textile and chemical industries. The early thrust of industrial-
ization was supplied by large import substitution projects in the state sector.
These suffered, however, from the limited domestic market and shortages of
experienced staff and management. Under the Fourth Plan, private manufacturing
investment, particularly in textiles, fertilizers and metals transformation,
is expected to average D 25 million per year between 1973 and 1976, compared
with D 12 million in 1972, and to account for two-thirds of total investment
in manufacturing; these targets are likely to be exceeded. Foreign and do-
mestic private investment is now stimulated by a comprehensive incentive frame-
work, and the streamlined approval procedures of the investment promotion
agency. Foreign investors are expected to contribute know-how and overseas
marketing. Tunisia's preferential trade agreement with the EEC, currently
being renegotiated, also gives it some trade advantages. Preinvestment work,
and preparation of programs for re-equipment and modernization in priority
subsectors have been started. Tunisia aims to develop petroleum-based indus-
tries and production of phosphoric acid and other phosphate derivatives for
export, while possibilities in metal manufacturing for export are being ex-
plored. The Government has recently established a special fund to encourage
growth of small industries and industrial decentralization, and has started
a program to establish industrial estates.



-5-
15.       The development of tourism is relatively recent.   Foreign-visitor
arrivals in Tunisia reached a record level of 780,000 in 1972, with an annual
rate of growth over the period 1961-1972 of 30 percent -- higher than any
other Mediterranean country. Since 1970 earnings from tourism have been a
major source of foreign exchange, having reached US$154 million in 1973. While
1973 saw a drop in the number of visitor nights, and 1974 registered another
overall drop, increased activity in the last few months of 1974 provides some
basis for optimism in the medium-term.   The decline in tourist inflow resulted
from both external and domestic factors, the former being mainly the effect
of the energy crisis on the European tourist flow and adverse currency move-
ments, the latter inadequate development of infrastructure (particularly re-
creational facilities), shortages of trained manpower and the inadequacy of
services. The government is aware of these shortcomings and is endeavoring to
alleviate their effects through a variety of measures including the issuance
of revised investment incentives, increased efforts in marketing, and the pre-
paration of codes to enforce quality standards and more stringent zoning laws.
These efforts are supported by the Bank Group and IFC projects in hotel
training and tourism infrastructure.
16.       Since the early 1960's Tunisia has received relatively large amounts
of external capital. Official aid amounted to an average of US$19 per capita
per annum, almost half from the United States, mostly in the form of program
loans and PL 480 commodity aid. Other major lenders were France, the Federal
Republic of Germany, Italy, Kuwait and the Bank Group. In recent years there
has been a steady shift away from program lending to project lending. Project
loans accounted for 58 percent of total disbusements in 1969-1972 and over
70 percent in 1974. Most aid has been obtained on concessionary terms: from
1969-1972, the average terms of borrowing from bilateral sources were 2.3
percent interest and 27 years to maturity, including 9 years of grace; from
multilateral sources 5.4 percent interest and 28 years to maturity, including
6 years of grace. For private borrowing (about $40 million annually), average
terns were 6.0 percent interest and 9 years to maturity. Direct foreign pri-
vate investment in Tunisia has been limited. However, mainly as a result of
increasing outlays on petroleum exploration and development, and, recently, of
some foreign investment in export oriented manufacturing industries, it has
risen from an average of $19 million per annum in the late 1960's to $32 mil-
lion in 1972 and $59 million in 1974.
17.       Tunisia's total external public debt was $1,296 million (of which
$836 million were disbursed) at the end of 1973. Debt service is estimated
to have fallen from 16.2 percent in 1972 to 9.4 percent in 1974 of exports
of goods, non-factor services and workers' remittances.    The ratio is project-
ed to fall to 8 percent by 1976, following recent increases in commodity ex-
port earnings, but to rise rapidly after 1980. While Tunisia is capable of
servicing substantial additional debt on less concessionary terms than in the
past, it should continue to seek part of its external needs on concessionary
terms so as to prevent the debt service ratio from rising unduly in the long-
term.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TUNISIA
18.       Starting in 1962, Tunisia has received a total of twenty Bank loans
and ten IDA credits amounting respectively to $230.7 million and $65.7 million,
net of cancellations and refundings. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Barnk loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of November 30, 1974, and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
19.       While there have been some problems in project execution, as in the
railways, agricultural credit and family planning projects, on the whole proj-
ect implementation has been satisfactory. Important institutional improve-
ments have been achieved. In both the transport and public utilities sectors,
independent agencies have been created or strengthened.
20.       In accordance with Tunisian priorities, past Bank Group lending has
emphasized support for long-term investments in infrastructure and social de-
velopment. Lending for transport, power and tourism infrastructure accounts
for 34 percent of Bank/IDA commitments in Tunisia. Lending for urban and
social development, including water supply, education, family planning and
the Tunis urban planning and public transport project, accounts for a further
31 percent. Industrial and hotel financing through Banque de Developpement
Economique de Tunisie (BDET) comes third with 16 percent. Agriculture and
fisheries have received 13 percent of total commitments, and the Gafsa
phosphate development project accounts for 8 percent of total commitments.
21.       Future lending is expected to support the Government's policies aiming
at rapid growth in a more open, export-oriented economy, measures to create
employment and to achieve a more equitable income distribution, and institu-
tional reform. The proposed lending program emphasizes investment in agri-
culture with a substantial rural development component. This would require
substantial Government inputs of manpower and technical assistance to support
increased production and the creation of new institutions which can reach the
rural poor. Over the next several years, it is expected that a number of proj-
ects will be presented which address the problems of land reform, organiza-
tion for agricultural and rural development, and integration of agricultural
with other aspects of rural development.
22.       Lending for industry has so far been through the main Tunisian devel-
opment finance company, BDET, and has mostly benefited medium-size companies.
Such lending will continue, but at a declining rate as BDET diversifies its
sources of funds. It has recently been supplemented by direct industrial
lending for the phosphate mining project, and further loans are planned for
industrial states and priority industrial subsectors, now being studied with
Bank assistance, in which Tunisia has a comparative advantage.
23.       The Bank Group accounted for almost 20 percent of disbursements of
official aid to Tunisia between 1969 and 1972 and is expected to maintain its
share, with that of the US declining and that of other, particularly Arab,
sources of funds rising. The Bank Group's shares in total debt outstanding



-7-
at the end of 1972 and in debt services during 1972 were 18 percent and 7 per-
cent respectively. Over the rest of the decade, the Bank Group's share in
total external debt is not expected to vary much; its share in debt service
will probably rise to approach the share of debt outstanding.
24.       IFC has invested in a fertilizer plant, in BDET, in COFITOUR (a
company to promote and invest in tourism projects), in RYM (a large hotel de-
velopment) and in a promotional company, Sousse Nord, which is to prepare plans
for an integrated tourism resort development in one of the areas in which tour-
ism infrastructure is being financed jointly by the Bank, IDA and Kreditanstalt
fur Wiederaufbau (KfW). IFC's most recent investment, in May 1974, was in
Industries Chimiques du Fluor, which will produce aluminium fluoride from local
fluorspar for export. With the inclusion of this investment IFC's net commit-
ments in Tunisia total $14.0 million.
PART III - WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE IN TUNISIA
25.       The water resources of Tunisia are exceedingly limited.   Surface
waters of any importance are only found in the northern part of the country.
Yet, even there, the rivers have irregular flows, and the water is generally
brackish and unfit for human consumption. The most important single source --
the only stream running continuously throughout the year -- is the Medjerda
River. Groundwater recharge is important, but the quality of the water is
reduced by salinity, which often makes the water unfit even for irrigation.
In future years, Tunisia may have to consider recycling of treated sewage as
an economic alternative to desalination of brackish or sea water.
26.       The demand for irrigation and for potable water could exceed the
total available supply of fresh water in the southern part of the country as
early as 1980. Studies are presently underway on the possibilities of irriga-
tion with brackish waters, on the possibility of mixing brackish water with
water of better quality to produce greater quantities of water with higher but
still acceptable salinity, and on irrigation with raw or treated sewage. The
Directorate of Studies and Major Water Works (DEGTH), in the Ministry of Agri-
culture, is responsible for over-all management of the country's water re-
sources.
27.       The production and distribution of potable water are the responsi-
bility of Societe National d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux (SONEDE),
an autonomous public utility established in 1968. The creation of SONEDE has
accelerated the provision of water to individual houses, particularly in the
smaller urban centers and semi-rural areas. By 1978, SONEDE is expected to
be supplying all settlements having a populations of 500 or more; the remain-
ing rural population, constituting 28% of the country's population, live in
isolated dwellings which cannot readily be served by public water distribution
systems and may ultimately by supplied by systems of public wells and fountains.
SONEDE has been the immediate beneficiary of two Bank loans and one IDA credit.
It also has responsibilities for water supply under the tourism infrastructure
project financed jointly by the Bank, IDA and KfW.



- 8 -
28.       While the supply of potable water has been a matter of active con-
cern to both the Government and the Bank for some time, sewerage services have
received little attention. Until the adoption of legislation creating a
national sewerage authority in August, 1974, responsibility for sewerage serv-
ices rested largely with the individual municipalities. Even in those muni-
cipalities with some form of sewerage, the systems are incomplete, overloaded
and badly maintained, if at all. From 1960 to 1974 the number of municipali-
ties with some form of sewer system rose from 9 to 20, but their total depre-
ciated value has only been estimated at $32 million, compared to a depreciated
value of $127 million for water supply systems.
29.       The lack of a clear division of responsibilities among the interested
ministries, municipalities, and state agencies has resulted in the weaknesses
in decision-making on policies relating to sewerage. To meet this situation,
the Government has created the new national sewerage authority, ONAS. ONAS is
charged by law with the planning, operation, maintenance, renewal and con-
struction of all sewerage works located within the limits of the communes and
within tourism or industrial development areas. It is expected that the cen-
tralization of responsibilities and clarification of authority represented in
the establishment of ONAS will facilitate the greatly accelerated investments
in the sector foreseen by the current Fourth Plan.
Water Supply and Sewerage in the Tunis Area
30.       Greater Tunis is well-served by public water supply.    About 84% of
the population is presently connected to the system, and SONEDE expects that
this will rise to 90% by 1980. Present sources of supply are expected to be
able to meet the needs of the Tunis area until 1981. Per capita water con-
sumption in Greater Tunis is 38 cubic meters per year, compared to an average
of 23 cubic meters throughout the country. The relatively better water quality
is among the principal factors accounting for the fact that the incidence of
reported typhoid and paratyphoid (and presumably other water-borne diseases)
is only half of the average rate throughout the country.
31.       The sewerage of Tunis is far from adequate, despite the existence
of a fairly complete system which serves about 90% of those connected to the
public water supply system. The deficiencies of the sewerage system are felt
particularly in summer, when strong unpleasant odors are produced by the Lake
of Tunis and some of the older parts of the city, and in winter during the
rainy season when the sewers overflow and sewage stagnates on the streets in
the low-lying central area of the city. The Lake of Tunis, a body of salt
water approximately seven kilometers wide and one meter deep, is highly
eutrophic and is rapidly filling with septic solids. The absence of oxygen
leads to substantial fish-kills each summer.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       The need for nation-wide measures to deal with Tunisia's sewerage
problems became apparent in connection with the preparation of the tourism
infrastructure project, which includes both water and sewerage components.
Funds were included in the infrastructure project for studies by consultants
leading to an urban sewerage project. Following a pre-appraisal mission in
September, 1973, the project was appraised in May-June, 1974. Negotiations
were held in December, 1974. The Borrower was represented by Mr. T. Ennaifar
of the Ministry of Planning. A report entitled "Appraisal of the First Urban
Sewerage Project -- Tunisia" (No. 58Ia-TUN), dated January 15, 1975, is being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors. A loan and project summary
is attached as Annex III.
The National Sewerage Authority (ONAS)
33.       The national sewerage authority, ONAS, is fully owned by the State.
While it is financially autonomous, state supervision will be exercised by
the Ministry of Equipment. It is expected that, following normal Tunisian
practice, the Board of Directors will delegate managerial responsibilities to
the President-Director-General. The Bank was consulted on the selection of
the President-Director-General, and will be consulted during project execution
on any change in this position (Loan Agreement, Section 3.03). The Bank will
also be consulted on the nominees to the posts -- still to be established --
of Deputy Director-General and Director of Finance and Administration, as well
as or. any changes in these positions during project execution (ONAS Project
Agreement, Section 3.02). ONAS' initial staff will be selected largely from the
existing staff of the Division of Urban Hydraulics in the Ministry of Equipment,
and from the sewerage staffs of the municipalities of Tunis and Sfax. A spe-
cial personnel statute will be adopted, which is expected to be similar to that
of SONEDE, to facilitate recruitment by providing more advantageous working
conditions and salaries than obtainable in normal government departments (Loan
Agreement, Section 3.04(a)(i)). In any case, since the labor market is unable
to provide all the necessary skills in sufficient number, ONAS will establish
a training division, and will exchange views with the Bank on a detailed
training program within a year of the date of the Loan Agreement (ONAS Project
Agreement, Section 3.01(c)).
34.       The transfer of existing sewerage systems to ONAS, starting with
those in the Tunis District and in official tourism zones, will be made in
accordance with a time-table acceptable to the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section
3.04(b)); the transfer will be effected by decree. An inventory of all in-
stallations transferred to ONAS will be prepared, and the assets valued, with-
in two years of the transfer (ONAS Project Agreement, Section 4.06(a)). To
aid in starting up operations, ONAS has retained the consultants who prepared
the organization and operational aspects of the project, to advise on hiring,
training, personnel administration, accounting, and standard engineering prac-
tices. Additional supporting assistance is expected to be provided by the
Governments of the United States (through the Environmental Protection Agency),



- 10 -
Sweden (through WHO) and the Federal Republic of Germany. An agreement bet-
ween SONEDE and ONAS, acceptable to the Bank, covering joint billing and col-
lection arrangements, will be adopted (ONAS Project Agreement, Section 4.03).
35.       ONAS' investment program, 1975-1981, would provide a complete na-
tional urban sewerage service, which would reach 64% of the population, com-
pared with only 48% now receiving the existing inadequate service. The mone-
tary value of the program, D 77 million, may be compared with the D 19 mil-
lion estimated value of the existing installations.
The Prolect
36.       The major purposes of the project are to support the establishment
of ONAS as an effective operating agency, and to improve the sewerage facili-
ties of the Greater Tunis District. Project works in the Tunis area include
additions to the trunk sewer system; renovation of one treatment plant and the
construction of two new treatment plants; renovation and renewal of existing
sewers and extensions to serve built-up areas presently without service; and
construction of storm-water evacuation channels, with associated pumping sta-
tions, in the Lake of Tunis. Technical assistance and equipment will also be
provided for ONAS. In addition, studies of sewerage projects for the Fifth
Plan (1977-1980), of the construction industry, and of future land use in the
Lake of Tunis area will be financed under the loan.
37.       The studies by the consultants who prepared the project showed that
treatment of sewage in stabilization ponds would be the least-cost solution,
but the performance of these ponds varies with local conditions. Both the
Government and the consultants are concerned that the ponds might become septic
and give off odors such as those now emanating from the Lake of Tunis. Under
the tourism infrastructure project, a pilot plant based on stabilization pond
treatment is presently under construction, and the final decision will be
postponed until results demonstrate the applicability of the technique on a
large scale in Tunisia; in order to permit construction to begin as soon as
possible, the consultants are being asked to prepare plant designs for alter-
native treatment systems.
Prolect Execution
38.       With the assistance of consultants, ONAS will be responsible for
execution of all aspects of the project but the construction industry study
and the land use studies. Bidding documents for the major collectors will
soon be completed, and construction should begin in 1975. The project is
expected to be completed by the middle of 1979. ONAS will carry out a program,
agreed with the Bank, to monitor selected physical, public health and finan-
cial indicators (ONAS Project Agreement, Section 2.07(b)). The Government
will make credit available, through ONAS, for the construction of house con-
nections and extensions for low-income customers (Loan Agreement, Section
3.01 (c) (iii)).



39.       The Tunisian construction industry lacks the capacity to carry out
the program of public works investments foreseen in the Fourth Plan, especial-
ly in regard to irrigation, water supply and sewerage. The Government has
requested Bank assistance to deal with this problem, the most important aspect
of which is a shortage of skilled construction workers. Thus, the project
provides for an analysis of ways to augment the capacity of the Tunisian con-
struction industry, as well as a follow-up training program.
40.       Execution of the project will make it possible to plan the future
development of the land surrounding the Lake of Tunis, and of the Lake itself.
To ensure that the benefits of cleaning up the Lake accrue to the country as
a whole, rather than to private speculators, the Government will acquire the
remaining privately owned, un-built land within twelve months of the date of
the loan (Loan Agreement, Section 3.04(c)(ii)). Expropriation procedures will
be applied by the Government for the benefit of ONAS, where necessary, for the
acquisition of the land necessary for the project (Loan Agreement, Section
3.04 (c)(i)).
Role of the Tunis District
41.       The Tunis District, the Government investment plannirng, programming
and supervision agency for metropolitan Tunis established with Bank Group as-
sistance under the Tunis District Urban Planning and Public Transport Project
(Loan No. 937, Credit No. 432), had been consulted on the sewerage project be-
fore negotiations and given its approval. Under a Project Agreement with the
Bank, the District will carry out the land use studies foreseen under the proj-
ect; the studies will be submitted to the Bank for review, along with the
District's proposals for zoning the Tunis Lake area for future development,
within three years of the date of the loan (District Project Agreement, Sec-
tion 2.04). The Government will take the legal zoning decisions within fivea
years of the loan and ensure that the Lake area is developed in accordance
with the approved land development plans (Loan Agreement, Section 3.05).
42.       The District has not yet become the effective operating agency desired
by the Government and the Bank. As the sewerage project involves some of the
most important public investments in the Tunis area for a considerable period
of time, with particular relevance to metropolitan-wide development, the proj-
ect provides an occasion to strengthen the District and to establish in prac-
tice policies the Bank has encouraged the Government and the District to follow.
43.       The factors inhibiting the District's effectiveness were discussed
during negotiations on the sewerage project, and the Government has undertaken
to promulgate administrative circulars acceptable to the Bank setting out the
District's working procedures and relations with agencies active in the Tunis
area (Loan Agreement, Section 6.01(g)), and to adopt a personnel statute ac-
ceptable to the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 3.04(a)(ii) and 6.01(e)). With-
in four months of the date of the Loan, ONAS and the District will conclude
an agreement acceptable to the Bank, defining their mutual relationship and
responsibilities in the execution of the project and in the planning and ex-
ecution of ONAS investment program in the District (District Project Agreement,



- 12 -
Section 2.05, ONAS Project Agreement, Section 2.09); this agreement is expect-
ed to constitute a model for future agreements between the District and other
public authorities active in the Tunis area.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
44.       Total project cost is estimated at $86 million, including allow-
ances for contingencies and expected price increases. The foreign exchange
component is estimated at $56 million, 65% of total project cost. Because of
the weaknesses in the Tunisian contracting industry, it is virtually certain
that all major construction contracts will be won by foreign firms. The cost
estimates also assume that the sewage treatment process ultimately selected
will be that employing the most mechanical equipment; if the pilot plant
demonstrates the acceptability of stabilization ponds, the foreign exchange
costs might be reduced.
45.       The Bank loan of $28 million would finance 33% of total project
costs, and 50% of the foreign exchange cost. The Republic of Tunisia would be
the Borrower of the Bank loan. It would make available to ONAS, under a sub-
sidiary loan agreement, all the foreign exchange required (including the bulk
of the Bank loan and about $28 million from its own resources) to carry out
the components of the project for which ONAS is responsible (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.01(c)(i)). The local currency requirements would be provided by
internal cash generation, customer contributions to sewerage investments, and
Government contributions to ONAS' equity (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01(c)(ii)).
The $0.3 million of the Bank loan not relent to ONAS would, in part, finance
the construction industry study (to be carried out by consultants to the
Ministry of Equipment) and in part finance the land use studies of the Tunis
District. UNDP funds were not available to finance the technical assistance
components of the project.
Procurement and Disbursement
46.       All major contracts for the supply of equipment, pipes, and civil
works, would be awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's procurement guidelines. A margin of preference of 15% or the
applicable customs duty, whichever is lower, would be granted to local equip-
ment manufacturers. The contract covering the renovation and increase in
capacity of the existing sewage treatment plant costing about D 1,500,000,
would be negotiated with the original supplier, from whom a firm quotation,
considerably lower than consultants' estimates, has been received. Subject
to an aggregate maximum of D 250,000 ($590,000) minor contracts for mainte-
nance and the supply of equipment costing less than D 25,000 ($59,000) would be
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally, and in accord-
ance with ONAS' bidding procedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank. Tender
documents for the supply of equipment and pipes whose value exceeds D 20,000
($47,000) and for civil works whose value exceeds D 100,000 ($235,000) would
be submitted to the Bank for approval before bids are invited.



-13 -
47.       The Bank loan would be disbursed, over about five years, against
50% of the cost of imported equipment and pipes and of the ex-factory cost
of locally manufactured equipment and pipes; against 35% of the cost of civil
works contracts, representing 50% of the estimated foreign exchange cost;
and against 50% of the foreign exchange costs of consultants. Retroactive
financing of up to $400,000 is proposed for the costs of consultants, minor
civil works contracts and the purchase of sewer maintenance equipment, since
June 30, 1974.
ONAS' Financial Position
48.       While ONAS is financially autonomous, financial policy decisions
will be subject to Government approval, and the authority will depend signifi-
cantly upon the Government for financial support. ONAS basic capital require-
ments, 4ncluding initial working capital, will be met by the Government, either
directly or through on-lending of foreign loans. Under the relevant Tunisian
legislation fronting proprietors will pay part of the cost of sewer extensions
directly to ONAS, and the Government will assume responsibility for servicing
the debt on existing sewerage installations transferred to ONAS by the mu-
r.icipalities.
49.       ONAS' tariffs will be based on water consumption.   Domestic customers
consuming less than 40 cubic meters quarterly would not be charged by ONAS but
would contribute to ONAS through municipal taxes, including a special sewerage
tax. Tariffs are expected to be established for domestic customers, in rela-
tion to water consumption, at a rate of 8 millimes per cubic meter, for indus-
try zt 23 millimes per cubic meter and for tourist establishments at 15.5
millimes per cubic meter. The implementation of a tariff structure satisfac-
tory to the Bank w-ould-be a condition of effectiveness of the loan (Loan Agree-
ment, Section 6.01 (c)).
50.       Since the revenues from tariffs, from services and sales of by-
products a;Ld from muni-ipal levies will cover ONAS' operating expenses, but
only part of depreciation, the Government has decided to support the operation-
al needs of ONAS by subsidies, which w.ll balance the annual operating account.
The subsidies will amount to D980,000, equivalent to 16 millimes per cubic
meter of water ($0.14/1,000 gallons), in 1975, 25 millimes per cubic meter
($0.22/1,000 gallons) in 1976 and 40 millimes per cubic meter ($0.36/1,000
gallons) in 1977 and thereafter (Loan Agreement, Section 4.02(a)). The sub-
sidies are justified by the fact that the proposed project will benefit a wider
section of the community than the population actually connected to the system,
and their cost is covered by the increases in the value of the land surrounding
the Lake. Improved sewage collection and disposal and extended connection of
urban dwellings to the systems will provide health benefits to the country.
The investment in trunk collectors, treatment and disposal works serves the
protection of the whole envirorment. Such facilities make up a substantial
part of the project, represent about half the value of existing installations,
and moreover, account for the bulk of operating expenses of ONAS.



- 14 -
51.       The financial benefits accruing to the Government and local authori-
ties from the increase in value of the land surrounding the Lake are expected
to be more than sufficient to cover the subsidies transferred to ONAS through
the Government budget. The average annual amount of the subsidy foreseen
during the initial years of ONAS' operations will be approximately equal to
9% interest on the present value of the benefit from the increases in land
values discounted at 10%. The form of the subsidy will be a fixed rate per
cubic meter of water consumed. This will encourage better financial manage-
ment than would a fixed annual amount and would, if so desired, facilitate
the gradual abolition of the subsidy without affecting financial forecasts
and budgetary requirements.   Starting in 1980, the Government will review
the subsidy level every five years and submit the revised level to the Bank
for approval (Loan Agreement, Section 4.02(b)).
52.       ONAS' expected revenues, from proposed tariffs, sewerage levies and
from Government subsidies are shown below, expressed as an average per cubic
meter of water during the periods indicated.

53.       ONAS is expected to have a relatively good operating ratio (operating
expenses including depreciation, in relation to revenues), averaging 69 percent
over the period 1975-1981. Except for one year, its rate of return on net fixed
assets is projected to be higher than 3%. During negotiations, it was agreed
that ONAS would maintain an internal cash ratio of not less than 4.0 percent
of net fixed assets plus work in progress, and that no debt would be incurred,
without the Bank's agreement, unless net revenue, before depreciation, is at
least 1.5 times the annual service on the proposed loan and existing debt (ONAS
Project Agreement, Sections 4.04, 4.05). ONAS' accounts will be certified by
an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank (ONAS Project Agreement, Section
4.02).
Project Justification
54.       The economic rate of return on the trunk sewers and sewage treat-
ment plants -- the pollution control componeat of the project -- is estimated
at 24.9 percent; it would exceed 10 percent under adverse assumptions. The
return derives principally from the increases in the value of the land sur-
rounding the Lake of Tunis. Other benefits of the project will include in-
creased fishing revenues and revenues from the sale of treated waste water



- 15 -
for irrigation and digested sludge for use as fertilizer, but these benefits
are not significant in their impact on the economic rate of return. The bene-
fits are understated to the extent that they ignore tourism benefits from
protecting beaches adjacent to the Gulf of Tunis, as well as improvements in
public health, and, as a result of the elimination of the unpleasant odor of
the Lake of Tunis, in the quality of life for residents of the Tunisian
national capital.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of Tunisia,
the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and ONAS, the draft Project Agree-
ment between the Bank and the Tunis District, the report of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the
text of a draft resolution approving the proposed Loan are being distributed
.o the Executive Directors separately.
56.       Special conditions of effectiveness include the execution and
delivery of the subsidiary loan agreement (para 45) and of the ONAS-SONEDE
joint billing and tariff collection agreement (para 34); and the promulgation
of the tariff schedule of ONAS (para 49), the personnel statute of the Tunis
District (para 43), the decree or decrees enabling ONAS to carry out its
operations in the District and the tourism zones (para 34) and the administra-
tive circulars relating to the District (para 43).
57.       The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern of loans for
sewerage projects. Features of the Agreements of special interest are re-
ferred to in paragraphs 33 through 53 of this Report.
58.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. 94: Second Education Project; US$13 million credit of September 16, 1966;
Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1970; (current) December 31, 1974.
Physical execution of the project is almost completed. All project
schools have been accepted by the government from the contractors, virtually
all equipment and furniture have been purchased, and most of it has been de-
livered and installed. Despite early delays in the appointment of UNESCO ex-
perts and their counterparts in the Educational Planning Unit, an interim re-
port, including a diagnosis of primary and general secondary education and a
preliminary analysis of higher education, has been prepared. However, the
report does not cover vocational and technical training, education finances
and management, and administration of the education system. To allow for the
utilization of savings and the completion of the technical assistance program,
the present Closing Date is being extended.
Ln. 581:  First Water Supply Project; US$15 million loan of January 16, 1968;
Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1973; (current) December 31, 1974.
Cr. 209:  Second Water Supply Project; US$10.5 million credit of June 30, 1970;
Ln.  Closing Date:  December 31, 1974.
Ln. 989:  Third Water Supply Project; US$23 million loan of May 29, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Because of problems with locally manufactured asbestos-cement pipe
completion of the First Project has been delayed. Constraints resulting from
lack of capacity in the local construction industry require that the Closing
Date be further set back until the end of 1975. Final project costs are
expected to be about 6% below appraisal estimates (but 7% higher in dollar
terms because of devaluation). The Second Project is 12 to 18 months behind
schedule for the same reasons as well as because of initial delays in final
design. Final costs may be about 5% higher than,original estimates because of
current inflation rates, but they will be 20%-25% higher in dollar terms.
Because of delays in execution, the Closing Date is being_extended.    The loan
for the Third Project became effective before the initial deadline; procurement
has begun and is on schedule.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. 606:  Railways Project; US$8.5 million loan and US$8.5 million credit,
Cr. 150:  both of June 4, 1969; Closing Date of loan:    (original) December 31,
1973; (current) December 31, 1975.
The project has been delayed both by floods (one year) and by finan-
cial difficulties (one year). The financial problems were caused by non-payment
of freight charges by the railway's largest customer, the state-controlled Cafsa
Phosphate Company; operational deficits, due to low rates and fares; and higher
than estimated prices of rolling stock. Government has undertaken to reimburse
railway losses for 1972 and 1973. A new cost-based tariff was introduced in
January 1974; traffic continues to rise but operating results have not improved
as much as expected, and continuing Government contributions to the railways
and further tariff increases will be required. A reallocation of the proceeds
of the loan and credit permitted the placing of all outstanding orders; cost
increases of about $6 million for items in the original list of goods are being
financed by utilizing a Spanish line of credit. The credit has been fully
disbursed; the Closing Date of the loan was extended to permit completion of
disbursements.
Cr. 238: Population Project; US$4.8 million credit of April 5, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
After a slow start, resulting in a 24-month delay, there has been
considerable progress in recent months, but several problems remain. A new
Director General has recently been appointed to the National Office for Family
Planning and Population. Program performance, though showing signs of improving,
is still inadequate. An Association sector report incorporating a Four Year
Plan of Action has recently been forwarded to the Government. This, together
with the appointment of the new Director General, should assist in improving
performance. The total cost of the project is now estimated at least three
times the $7.7 million estimated at appraisal. The Association is consulting
the Government on the measures to be taken to deal with this situation. In-
tensified supervision of the project is being maintained.
Ln. 746: Highways Project; US$24 million loan of June 9, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Project execution, which fell behind schedule initially due to
lengthy Government procedures and changes in key personnel, is now proceeding
satisfactorily. Progress in reconstruction and rehabilitation of roads and
bridges is good. The estimated cost of the project has increased significantly,
mainly as a result of dollar devaluation. One major road section may be elim-
inated from the project. The Government has been requested to provide supple-
mentary funds to permit completion of the other project components.

Ln. 779: Agricultural Credit Project; US$5 million loan and US$3 million
Cr. 263: credit, both of July 12, 1971; Closing Dates: July 31, 1975.
Disbursements are behind schedule, especially for dairy farms, since
the cost of imported cows has risen and there is competition between Bank/IDA
and other cheaper funds. This competition has resulted in financing of live-
stock operations by BNT to farmers who should only borrow at the higher interest
rates foreseen under the Bank loan and IDA credit. A severe flood in March
1973 also affected project progress. The IDA credit has been fully disbursed.
Consultations between the Bank and the Government and BNT are underway with a
view to accelerating the progress of the project, and solving the problem of
competition between Bank and Government subsidized funds. Should agreement
not be reached on this matter, the Bank may have to consider cancelling the
uncommitted portion of the loan foreseen for dairy farm development.
Cr. 270: Fisheries Project; US$2 million credit of September 24, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project is now being actively implemented after earlier diffi-
culties and delays experienced in design of an economic project vessel suit-
able for operation by traditional fishermen. Problems were also encountered
in selecting the marine engine to equip the project boat. Although costing
100% more than originally estimated, the project boat is still economic be-
cause of sharp increases in fish prices since appraisal. The demand for the
project vessel is also strong as it represents a significant improvement over
traditional vessels of the same quality and costs about 23% less than these
boats. It is expected that about 190 boats will be constructed under the
project, instead of the 335 provided for under the project initially.
Ln. 858: Tourism Infrastructure Project; US$14 million loan and US$10 million
Cr. 329: credit, both of September 28, 1972; Closing Dates: December 31, 1977.
The project experienced initial delays because of the time required
to adopt legislation establishing the public land. corporation which is to ac-
quire land in the project zones for resale to investors. The development
studies for the six project zones, being executed by consultants, are almost
on schedule. Invitations for bids for some project works have been issued.
A study of Government incentives for investment in tourism is nearly complete.
Ln. 798: Fourth Development Finance Company Project; US$10 million loan of
February 9, 1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1976.
Ln. 881: Fifth Development Finance Company Project; US$14 million loan of
February 20, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1978.
Disbursements under Ln. 798 are slightly behind schedule, while
disbursements under Ln. 881 are ahead of schedule. Business greatly exceeded
projections in 1973 and is continuing at an accelerated rate. Persistent

problems include the adequacy of provisions against possible losses, the sub-
stantial amount of arrears of hotel borrowers and the lack of valid mortgage
security for certain sub-loans; these are being closely watched. The dependence
of BDET (ex-SNI) on the Government and the IBRD is expected to be reduced by
BDET's raising considerable funds from local and other foreign sources. A sixth
loan is currently being processed.
Ln. 937: Tunis District Urban Planning and Public Transport Project; US$11
Cr. 432: million loan and US$7 million credit, both of October 5, 1973;
Closing Dates: December 31, 1976.
Due to delays in appointment of consultants and completion of the
necessary legal actions and opinions, the loan and credit for this project
only became effective in September, 1974. Signature of the UNDP Project Document
for technical assistance to the Tunis District was completed in October, 1974.
As the offer of the Tunisian supplier fell within 15 percent of the interna-
tional reference price agreed with the Bank/IDA, the public transport company
(SNT) has decided to award him the contract for supply of project buses. The
District has faced some difficulty in recruiting the staff foreseen under the
project, and in establishing itself as an effective interlocutor of national
agencies. Steps to deal with these problems are now being taken.
Ln. 1029: Hotel Training Project; US$5.6 million loan of July 17, 1974;
Closing Date: October 31, 1978.
Due largely to delays in the acquisition of sites for project hotel
training centers by the National Tourist Office (ONTT), effectiveness of the
loan for this project has been delayed. Consulting architects have been
selected from official lists provided by the Ministry of Equipment. Current
and project price increases are not expected to increase the project cost
beyond contingency allowances. The project unit initially created for the
tourism infrastructure project has been enlarged by addition of the staff
necessary for the construction of the hotel training centers. Recruitment
of technical assistance personnel is nearly complete.
Ln. 1042: Gafsa Phosphate Project; US$23.3 million loan of October 1, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This loan has not yet become effective as a result of delays in com-
pleting the necessary legal formalities. However, prequalification of equip-
ment suppliers is underway. Terms of reference for a study of development
possibilities in the mining region are under discussion.
Ln. 1068: Irrigation Rehabilitation Project; $12.2 million loan of December
31, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
Execution of this project is about to begin.

Procurement:         All major contracts for the supply of equipment, pipes,
and civil works, will be awarded after international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's procurement
guidelines. A margin of preference for local equipment
manufacturers of 15%, or the applicable customs duties,
whichever is lower, will be applied in the evaluation of
bids. The contract covering the renovation and increase
in capacity of the existing treatment plant will be
negotiated with the original supplier. Subject to an
aggregate maximum of D 250,000 ($590,000), minor contracts
for maintenance and supply of equipment costing less than
D 25,000 ($59,000) will be awarded on the basis of com-
petative bidding advertised locally and in accordance with
ONAS' bidding procedures, which are satisfactory to the
Bank. Tender documents for the supply of equipment and
pipes whose value exceeds_D 20,000 ($47,000) and for civil
works whose value exceeds D 100,000 ($235,000) will be sub-
mitted to the Bank for approval before bids are invited.
Retroactive financing of up to $400,000 is proposed for
expenditures incurred since June 30, 1974, for the foreign
exchange costs of consultant services, for minor civil
works contracts and for the purchase of sewer maintenance
equipment.

Consultants:        The two groups of consultants who prepared the feasibility
studies for the project have been retained by ONAS to
prepare bidding documents, to supervise construction, and
to assist in hiring, training, and personnel administration,
as well as in accounting and standard engineering practices.
Additional consultant services will be required for the
feasibility studies for sewerage projects included in the
Fifth Plan, for the construction industry study and training
program, and for the land use studies to be carried out by
the Tunis District.
