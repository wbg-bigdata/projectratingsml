INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA
FOR THE BIHAR AGRICULTURAL MARKETS PROJECT
1.      I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $14 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance an agricultural markets project
in Bihar State, India.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.      In keeping with the importance of agriculture in the economy of
India and with the need to improve agricultural productivity, agricultural
lending is expected to account for a large share of future Bank Group
assistance, although financing of transportation projects, infrastructure,
and industry will continue to be important. Support to education and
family planning is also planned but here the scope for lending is limited.
3.      The credit now proposed for the development of regulated agricul-
tural markets in Bihar would be the Bank Group's first operation in this
field. A Report -and Recommendation on a proposed credit for the Maharashtra
Agricultural Credit Project is being distributed concurrently..  Before the end
of the fiscal year I'also expect to present recommendations with regard to an
industrial impcrts credit, a family planning.,project and a development bank
project.
4.      A summary statement of loans and credits as of January 31, 1972, and
IFC operations as of December 31, 1971 is in Annex I. Comments on the status
of disbursements of effective loans and credits are given in my Report and
Recommendation on the Maharashtra Agricultural Credit Project. That report
also contains a summary of the economic situation. A country data sheet is
attached as Annex II.
5.      The proposed agricultural markets project was prepared in co-opera-
tion with the Government of Bihar and appraised in June/July, 1971. Nego-
tiations were conducted in Washington during the week of January 24, 1972.
The Borrower was represented by Mr. M. A. Quraishi, Additional Secretary,
Ministry of Agriculture and by Mr. G. Venkataramanan, Deputy Secretary,
Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. The Agricultural
Refinance Corporation (ARC) was represented by its chairman, Mr. P. N.
Damry. Mr. R. C. Sinha, Agriculture Production Commissioner, Mr. N. P.
Mathur, Development Commissioner and Mr. A. K. Sarkar, Deputy Director,
Agricultural Marketing, represented the Bihar Government. Mr. J. S.
Varshneya, Chief Officer, Rural Credit, represented the State Bank of
India (SBI).

PART II - THE PROJECT
6.      An Appraisal Report on the proposed project, entitled t'Bihar
Agricultural Markets Project (PA-119a)" is being distributed separately.
A Credit and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
7.      The Government of India considers improvement of the agricultural
marketing system to be one of the key elements of the agricultural strategy
in the Fourth Plan. Traditional marketing systems are characterized by
dispersed marketing opportunities, location in congested areas, and inade-
quate storage facilities.  These imperfect marketing conditions allow
traders to charge margins which substantially exceed the cost of services
rendered, giving little incentive for farmers to increase production or
for traders to discriminate according to the quality of agricultural produce
offered.
8.      In order to rectify this situation, the Government of India has
encouraged the state governments to pass Regulated Agricultural Markets
Acts, and most states have done so. The Regulated Agricultural Markets
Act passed by the Government of Bihar in 1960 provides for the establish-
ment of regulated markets in designated areas administered by a Market
Committee on which are represented both traders and producers. The aim
of the Act is to bring about fair trading practices, competitive prices,
efficient handling and cleaning of produce, and a minimum of wastage.
The Act requires, inter alia, all marketed produce to be auctioned, com-
mission and other charges to be fixed, and sellers to be paid promptly.
9.      Market Committees have been constituted in some 60 towns but only
a small number of markets are effectively regulated and the Market Com-
mittees are unable to control market transactions satisfactorily. The
fees, established at 0.25% by the 1960 Act have proved too low to finance
suitable market facilities.
10.     The Government of Bihar has,therefore, recently amended its Regu-
lated Agricultural Markets Act of 1960, to provide for the creation of a
State Marketing Board (SMB), organized within the Ministry of Agriculture,
Bihar, and responsible to the State Government. SMB has general super-
vising powers over the Market Committees and has the power to fix market
fees, which have been raised to 1% of the value of agricultural produce
marketed, to ensure the financial viability of the Market Committees.
SMB is also the key management agency in planning for the development of
the markets and for their proper operation, and would be properly staffed
with administrators and marketing experts. SMB has power to take over the
operations of Market Committees in financial default or failing to regulate
properly marketing operations.



-3-
11.     The proposed Project would provide facilities, including land,
equipment, entrance roads, fencing, water and sewerage utilities and office
space, to be owned and controlled by Market Committees, in about 50 towns
in Bihar.. It would also provide for training of senior personnel for SMB,
market secretaries and qualified inspectors for Market Committees. Since
this would be the first IDA credit in support of agricultural markets,
evaluation procedures have been built into the Project.
12.     Market Committees wishing to participate in the Project would be
assisted by the Town Planning Organization (TPO) in preparing plans for the
development of market yards, taking into account criteria designed to give
space sufficient for appropriate facilities. The Rural Engineering Organi-
zation (REO) would prepare detailed plans and specifications and tender
documents for each individual market.
13.     Each Market Committee would have to satisfy certain minimum require-
ments. A formula would be applied to relate the size of the market yard to
the projected annual volume and value of market arrivals. A minimum of 20
trader's shops would be built, display platforms would be constructed, and
necessary infrastructure such as fencing, water supplies and sewerage, hard-
surfaced roads, etc. would be provided for. Equipment such as mechanical
cleaners for grain, platform scales, sampling probes and containers would be
installed. There would also be office facilities, and a resthouse and can-
teen available to the farmers and other participants in the markets, Stor-
age facilities would be constructed to store surplus grain, held either by
traders or by farmers.
14.     The Market Committees would lease storage facilities to appropriate
organizations, and would lease the trader's shops to private wholesalers
and traders. Rentals would be levied sufficient to produce revenue to the
Market Committee adequate to cover operating costs and debt service. The
Committees would also lease land, where suitable, within the market yards
for banks, post offices, cooperative marketing and credit associations, and
for shops selling agricultural inputs.
15.     The total costs of the project are estimated at US $23.3 million
equivalent. This estimate includes the cost of land ($1.44 million), civil
works ($15.3 million), equipment (0.24 million), training and project
evaluation ($0.19 million) and contingencies ($6.12 million). The cost
estimate is based on the price level at July 1971, and refers to a phased
5-year construction program which would start in 1973. This requires an
overall price contingency of 26%, based on an assumed annual cost - infla-
tion of 5%. The contingencies also include a physical contingency of 10%
on all costs excluding land. The foreign exchange component of the project
is estimated at US $5.9 million, equivalent to about 25% of the total cost
of the project, and includes the cost of imported steel, bitumen, utilities,
equipment and project evaluation.



-4-
16.     The proposed credit would cover 60% of the total project cost
including land. It would finance the equivalent of the foreign exchange
costs of the project and 50% of the local costs. The land would be pro-
vided as a contribution to the project by the State Government, which
would also bear the local currency cost of training and project evaluation.
The State Government's contributions would thus be about US $1.7 million
equivalent, that is, 7% of the total project cost. The remaining cost of
the investment in the markets, US $21.6 million, would be financed by the
Market Committees (5%), the State Bank of India (10%) and the Agricultural
Refinance Corporation out of its own funds (21%), IDA contributing 64%
from that part of the credit proceeds,US $13.8 million, which would be
relent to Market Committees through ARC.
17.     The proposed credit would be disbursed as to US $13.8 million
against loans extended by ARC to the SBI for local Market Committees, and
would cover 75% of ARC's loans. The remaining US $0.2 million would help
to finance the State Government's costs for training and project evaluation.
ARC would enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with the Government of
India, whereby the Government would extend the Association's funds to ARC
at 6 percent, with a rebate of i percent for prompt payment of principal
and interest, repayable over 15 years. ARC and SBI would enter into a
refinance agreement, whereby ARC would refinance SBI loans at 6 - ½ percent
interest over 15 years, and SBI would lend to the Market Committees at 9
percent repayable on terms up to 15 years including two, and exceptionally
up to three, years of grace. SBI would appoint an agricultural marketing
unit in its regional office in Patna to appraise loan applications from
Market Committees, before submitting them to ARC for refinancing.
18.     Construction of the markets, consisting of simple brick and concrete
structures, would be phased over five years in some 50 towns, and each
market would be designed in accordance with its individual needs. Because
of this diversity over area and time, and because each facility would differ
in design, each market would require a separate contract. Their construc-
tion would not, therefore, be suitable for international competitive bidding.
Adequate local contractors are available in Bihar.
19.     As stated in paragraph 10 above, the amended Bihar Agricultural
Markets Act empowers SMB to fix the market fee, charged by the Market
Committees, at 1% of the value of agricultural produce marketed. This
would assure the financial viability of the Market Committees, generating
surplus funds above thelr requirements for operating expenditures and debt
service. SMB would have control of the expenditure of the surplus funds
by Market Committees, and over the repayment period of loans they could be
used only to finance building of feeder roads for the markets or expansion
of market facilities.
20.     Although projections of population and production in Bihar indicate
a continuing deficit in cereals during the foreseeable future, paddy and
wheat production is expected to increase considerably, especially in irri-
gated areas under development. Also land area under vegetables and other



high value cash crop is being expanded, and there is a trend toward higher
cropping intensity in the whole State, particularly through the use of more
inputs and through the transition to double and triple cropping on irri-
gated land. Agricultural production and the volume of marketed produce will
expand substantially over the next decade, and it is of growing importance
that efficient marketing facilities be provided to minimize market wastage
to the extent possible and to increase farmer's incentives.
21.     Under the project, it is expected that farmer's prices would rise.
The Market Committees would reduce marketing charges imposed on the seller
from the present average of about 5.3% of arrival value to about 2.8%,
including the 1% fee levied by the Market Committees. Auctioning would also
tend to increase sales prices to farmers by increasing competition among
traders. Farmers would be able to utilize storage facilities provided in
the market places and, by timing sales of their produce, thereby stand to
receive better prices.
22.     The financial rate of return has been calculated to be 20% for
smaU markets and 40% for large markets. The size of the market places
would vary, depending upon the projected annual turnover of marketed
produce. The cash flow would, therefore, vary for different markets, but
even the small markets are expected to be financially viable. A cash flow
projection for ARC shows that it would adequately cover its operating costs
over the loan periods. Similarly, SBI would accumulate sufficient surpluses
to cover overhead and risk.
23.     As the project is the Bank Group's first lending for agricultural
markets, a new methodology for assessment was developed to identify the
most important benefits of the project. In this instance, the economic
rate of return calculation has been based on certain identifiable benefits
expected to derive from the improvement of grain quality, the reduction of
handling and storage losses and savings accruing to municipalities from
reduced congestion and improved organization of marketing. The economic
rate of return thus calculated is close to 30% and would increase by about
10% for every 1% increase in agricultural production that could be attri-
buted to better marketing opportunities. lMore precise and comprehensive
calculations of the impact of improved facilities would be essential to
planning further improvements in agricultural marketing and the proposed
project therefore provides for a project evaluation study. The study,
which would cover ten markets, would evaluate the changes resulting from
completion of the project on factors such as: prices received by farmers
and wholesale market prices; costs of marketing; different types of losses
of produce in the market yards; and market intelligence available to culti-
vators and market officials on prices, supplies, production.



-6-
24.     It has been estimated that 1.5 million farmers would benefit from
the project. Their aggregate income would increase by at least Rs 120
million from reduced handling losses and reduced market charges. This
estimate does not take account of additional production induced by more
favorable marketing conditions. Although traders would collect a reduced
fee on individual sales, they would benefit from reduced operating costs
and better quality produce. Market construction would require a total of
7,500 man years, and permanent employment of market yard staff and labor
would create about 2,000 jobs.
PART III - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
25.     The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
Association, the draft Agreement with the State of Bihar and a draft
Project Agreement among the Association and ARC and SBI, the Recommenda-
tion of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
Development Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors sep-
arately.
PART IV - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
26.     I am satisfied that the proposed development credit will comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECONI DATION
27.     I recommend that the Executives Directors approve the proposed
credit.
