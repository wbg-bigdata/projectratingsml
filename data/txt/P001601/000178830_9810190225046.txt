INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO MALAWI
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Malawi, for the equivalent of $11,6 million, on
standard IDA terms to help finance a second education project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An updating economic mission visited Malawi in May 1974 and its
report was distributed to the Executive Directors on January 14, 1975
(560-MAI). Country data are provided in Annex I.
3.        Since Independence, in 1964, Malawi's gross domestic product
has grown by an annual average of 8 percent in real terms, However, with
a per capita income of only $110, Malawi remains one of the poorest count-
ries in the world and is included in the United Nations list of the 25
least developed countries. Natural resources are limited to moderately fer-
tile soils, substantial water resources and a climate favorable to crop
production. Although bauxite and coal deposits have been discovered, their
exploitation has not yet been found to be commercially viable. Forests,
which cover about 33 percent of Malawi, constitute the main essentially
unused resource which could be exploited on a significant scale in the
near future.
4.        The sensitivity of GDP to changes in weather conditions has
gradually been reduced since 1964, as a result of the modernization of
agriculture and the diversification of the economy. At the same time,
the increasing output of export crops has directly caused a comparable
increase in processing, distributive and commercial activities, while
higher farm incomes have stimulated the local production of consumer
goods, Government policy is oriented towards rapid growth of agricul-
tural production and, indeed, real per capita farm incomes rose faster
during 1972 and 1973, and probably also in 1974 than incomes in the non-
agricultural sectors.
5.        A substantial savings and investment effort and generally effi-
cient management of the economy have contributed to economic growth. At
Independence, domestic savings were negligible and gross domestic invest-
ment was only 8.7 percent of GDP. By 1974, domestic savings had increased
to above 10 percent of GDP and gross domestic investment to 20 percent,
leaving a resource gap of US$61 million. A significant improvement in the
financial position of the Government has contributed to this impressive
rise in savings. At Independence, the Government was able to finance
only about half of recurrent expenditure from local resources, the



deficit being met by grants and loans from the UK. Between 1964 and
1974, improvements in tax administration and some changes in the tax
system enabled domestic revenue to rise annually by 15 percent, in compa-
rison with an average increase in recurrent expenditures of only 7 percent.
Government has been able to balance its recurrent budget since 1972/73.
6.        The Government increased development expenditures    at an annual
average rate of 17 percent from 1970 to 1974, with heavy emphasis on agri-
culture and transport. Agr[culture accounted for 27 percent of expenditure
in 1974 and transport for 31 percent. Several large-scale agricultural
schemes providing inputs, marketing facilities, some basic infrastructure
and credit, form the bulk of agricultural investment. Transport investments
have included the construction and improvement of roads, particularly those
opening up the central and northern regions, and the extension of the rail
network, including a new link to Nacala (opening up of a second outlet to
the sea) and a link from Salima to Lilongwe. For the future, agriculture
is to receive even greater emphasis, and one-third of the $196 million public
investment program over the next three years will be devoted to agricultural
development.
7.        Total investment was US$127 million in 1974 and is likely to
grow by 8 percent (in real terms) until 1980. A substantial role is
planned for the private sector in Malawi's future development, and private
investments are expected to equal those of the public sector. Government
has liberal policies to encourage both domestic and foreign private invest-
ment. Domestic private capital is concentrated mainly in agriculture and
small trading enterprises. Larger scale business is dominated by foreign-
owned companies.
8.        Whereas Malawi has benefited from a very rapid expansion of agri-
culture since Independence, the room for future expansion is smaller. An
annual economic growth rate of over 6 percent seems likely in the rest of the
1970's. Much of this will occur in the agricultural sector, as a result of
increased production of export crops such as tobacco, tea and cotton. Small
but growing surpluses of maize, pulses, groundnuts, cassava and sugar are
also expected. Malawi's agricultural exports, which increased, in constant
prices, at an average rate of nearly 9 percent from 1964 through 1974,
are projected to rise by an average of over 6 percent annually until 1980.
With the increasing investment program and growing consumer demand that
can only be partly met by domestic manufacturers, it is likely that the
country's import requirements will grow more rapidly than in the past.
9.        Malawi's terms of trade have moved unfavorably since 1970,
declining over 10 percent during 1971-73 and a further 5 percent in 1974.
Payments for fuel rose by over 50 percent in 1974, with only a modest
increase in volume, and the cost of other imported petroleum by-products
rose substantially.  Rising food import prices had relatively little im-
pact on Malawi, as most food is produced locally. Overall, import prices



in 1974 were 36 percent higher than their levels in 1973. During the same
period, export prices grew by only 28 percent, though all major export commo-
dities benefited from higher prices. As a result of the decline in Malawi's
terms of trade, the deficit on goods and non-factor services rose from $49
million in 1973 to $61 million in 1974. Capital inflow has generally been
adequate to finance deficits and build up moderate reserves.
10.       The current improvement in the mobilization of domestic resources (see
paragraph 5) for economic development can be sustained during the rest of the
decade. Public savings, which were negative until recently have begun to make a
positive contribution to investment. In 1974, Malawi financed 52 percent of
its investment from domestic resources; this proportion should grow to about
60 percent by the end of the decade. The external capital re quirements will,
however, continue to be in excess of the foreign exchange component of projects
and external aid should, therefore, also cover some local costs.
11.       At the end of 1974, Malawi's external public debt totalled
$320 million of which $224 million had been disbursed. Debt service in
that year amounted to $14.2 million, or about 9 percent of export earn-
ings. As Malawi' s need for external capital is expected to grow in the
next few years, the Government may encounter greater difficulty in borrow-
ing on terms as soft as those it has received in the past. Debt service
is likely to increase and the debt service ratio could reach 15 percent
by the end of the decade. In view of its low per capita income and the
fluctuations of its export earnings, Malawi should continue to receive a
substantial part of external assistance on concessionary terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
12.       To date, twelve IDA credits amounting to US$85.1 million have been
made to Malawi. Six of these credits, representing US$42.5 million (50 per-
cent of total IDA assistance to Malawi) were for projects in the agricul-
tural sector, The others consist of two credits totalling US$21.5 million
for highways in 1968 and 1974, two credits totalling US$12.75 million for
power projects in 1970 and 1973, a US$2.0 million credit in 1974 to help
finance the preparation of a proposed wood-pulp development scheme, and a
US$6.3 million credit for education in 1967.
13.       The proposed project would thus constitute the Bank Group's second
operation in the education sector. The first project, consisted of the
construction of, and the provision of equipment for, one national primary
teacher training college and the provision of technical instruction facil-
ities in 12 secondary schools. The project has been successfully implemented
and the school premises have been in use since 1972. Savings of about
US$420,000 are now being utilized to construct a post and telecommunication
school to be used jointly by Malawi, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. Con-
struction work is on schedule.



- 4 -
14.       There have been no Bank loans or IFC investments in Malawi, Annex
II contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of August 31, 1975 and
notes on the execution of on--going projects. Project execution is good.
At the end of 1974, IDA's share in Malawi's total external debt was 22.5
percent and servicing of IDA credits accounted for 2.4 percent of total
debt service.
15.       Bank Group operations will continue to emphasize rural develop-
ment, A second phase of the Karonga rural development program is scheduled
for appraisal in October/November 1975 and we are presently assisting the
government in devising a national rural development program for which we
expect to recommend Bank Group financial assistance in FY78. A third power
project and a water supply project for the city of Blantyre are being prepared
and are expected to be presented to you in the next two years. The Bank Group
is also assisting the Government in the preparation of a major pulp develop-
ment project whose total cost is currently estimated at over $300 million,
If it is established that the project is economically viable and satisfactory
arrangements can be made for its implementation and for marketing its pulp
output, and if satisfactory external guarantee can be arranged for the loan
financing, we expect to recommend a Bank contribution.
PART III - EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN MALAWI
16.       Formal education was practically neglected in Malawi until Inde-
pendence. Although the Government immediately accorded educational develop-
ment the high priority it deserved, the long period of neglect is manifested
in the fact that of all the Malawians who are over 40 years old, only about
one percent has had as much as eight years of formal schooling, Despite this
effort, only an estimated 25 percent of the population is literate. Only about
10 percent of the intermediate to high level labor foce is female.
17.       A large number of primary and secondary school teachers have not
received proper training and about 40 percent of secondary school teachers
are expatriates. In the agricultural sector, for which several training
programs have already been implemented, about 20 percent of the higher
level personnel are expatriates. In order to get a more accurate picture
of Malawi's future requirements for high and intermediate level manpower,
the Government is conducting several manpower studies including a review
of employment qualifications required for various jobs, a study of the per-
formance of secondary school graduates in the labor market, and a review
of the targets for secondary education growth, The Government will ex-
change views with the Association regularly on the progress and results
of these studies and reviews (see Section 4.02 of the Development Credit
Agreement).



18.       Formal schooling now consists of a five plus three-year primary
education course followed by four years of secondary education and post-
secondary and university courses of various durations. The formal education
system is well organized and managed. Teacher training, inspection, super-
vision and curriculum development programs are effectively operated. How-
ever, while fifty-six percent of the primary-school-age children are enrolled
in schools,the primary schools have a high drop-out rate with only forty per-
cent of the pupils who start grade one completing the course through grade
eight. Only four percent of the 15 to 18 year olds are in secondary schools.
19.       There are several non-formal and accelerated training programs
including a well-organized apprenticeship program to train farmers, craftsmen
and artisans in the rural areas. However, the programs were designed and
are operated by different ministries and parastatal agencies and are not
well coordinated. Consequently, duplications have occurred in several
areas. In order to correct these deficiencies, the Government recently
appointed a National Council for Education and Training. The Council,
with membership from all the relevant ministries, is now responsible for
planning, coordinating and overseeing the execution of non-formal education
programs. The influence of the Council is growing and duplicated programs
are being consolidated.
20.       To improve access to education and expand educational opportunities,
the Government in 1973, adopted an eight-year (1973-80) investment program
whose strategy gives priority to (a) the growth of primary education, (b) the
improvement of secondary schools in the rural areas, and (c) the strengthen-
ing of the various non-formal programs. The program includes:
(i) Expansion and improvement of primary schools under which
the Government will build replicable prototype schools
in the rural areas, and provide financial assistance
as well as technical guidance to villagers who will
build their own schools on self-help basis;
(ii)  Expansion and rationalization of primary school teachers
training through the construction of a second teacher
training college which will later replace the existing
small and inefficient teacher training institute operated
by missionary societies;
(iii) Expansion of the University of Malawi, the Polytechnic,
the existing agricultural colleges and the apprenticeship
program to meet the increasing demands for professional and
technical manpower;
(iv) Improvement and expansion of existing secondary schools;



(v) The introduction and sustaining of a comprehensive pro-
gram of adult education through the coordination of on-
going schemes and the provision of support facilities in
all the districts.
21.       The 1975-1980 portion of the planned investment in education is
estimated to cost 20.0 million Malawian Kwacha (US$24.0 million equivalent).
Of this total, several bilateral agencies are expected to provide about
MK 7.6 million. Total expenditure in the education sector is projected
by the Government to require about 24 percent of the recurrent budget in
1985 as compared to 21 percent at present. This level of expenditure compares
well with those of other countries in East Africa with comparable GDP per
capita. In view of the growth prospects of the economy, the Government
should be able to meet the projected expenditures.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       An Appraisal Report entitled "Malawi - Second Education Project",
No. 877 dated September 29, 1975 is being circulated to you separately. A
Credit and Project Summary is provided as Annex III, The project was pre-
pared and appraised in Malawi in March, 1975. Negotiations for the proposed
credit were held in Washington, D.C. from September 8 to 10, 1975. The Gov-
ernment delegation was led by Mr. A.H. Madinga, Secretary to the Treasury.
Project Description
23.       The proposed project is part of the Government's investment
program for the education sector for 1975-80. It consists of elements
of the program (described in paragraph 20 above), for which the Government
does not expect to be able to obtain financial assistance from other
sources. The project consists of the following parts:
A.   The construction, furnishing and equipping of: (i) 22
new prototype primary schools which will serve as
models to be replicated by local communities; (ii) 22
new rural education centers; (iii) one new teacher
training college including a demonstration school,
boarding facilities and staff houses; and (iv) addi-
tions to seven secondary schools including boarding
facilities and staff houses.
B.   A program to prepare future educational projects in
Malawi.
Detailed description of the project components is as follows:



-7-
Primary Schools
24.       The provision of primary school buildings is the responsibility of
local communities while the Government supplies teachers and provides support-
ing services such as in-service teacher training and supervision and inspection
of schools. Over 2,000 schools have been built on this basis. However, be-
cause of poor workmanship and the low quality of materials which the communi-
ties use, the buildings are often inappropriate for educational purposes and
have an average life of only about five years. In order to improve the struc-
tural quality and design standards of the school buildings, the Government has
decided to build, in 22 of the country's 24 districts, a model school which
the surrounding communities can replicate on a self-help basis.
25.       The  model schools will be financed under the proposed credit. The
criteria which would govern the selection of sites for the schools are satis-
factory. The Government would assist the districts in replicating the models
by designing and implementing a program under which each district would be
supplied with a construction supervisor to provide technical guidance and with
loans for the purchase of required materials. The Government would prepare
and review with the Association, a plan of operations providing details
of the program, including financial arrangement within one year of signing
the Development Credit Agreement (Section 4.03). It is expected that over
the next ten years, about 1,000 additional schools would be built around
the country following the proposed model schools.
Rural Education Centers
26.       Non-formal rural-oriented training has suffered from a lack of
coordination and inadequate attention to the requirements of adults for
training in several basic rural skills. The proposed project would provide
for the establishment of one rural education center in each of the 22 dis-
tricts attached to the primary schools described above. Local Councils in
each district would formulate guidelines under the auspices of the National
Education and Training Council for the operations of the centers to support
rural skill training and the ongoing government programs for literacy, public
health, community development and agricultural extension services, Training
needs and target groups would be identified on the basis of these guidelines.
Instructors are currently being trained in a special program at the Malawi
Polytechnic, In addition, local artisans would be recruited to teach at
the centers on a part-time basis. Each center would be located adjacent
to a primary school; it would be used for teaching practical subjects to
primary school students in the mornings and to adults in the afternoons.
A total of about 500 adults would be taught at each center annually.
Primary Teacher Training College
27.       About 20 percent of the primary school teachers are not adequately
trained, Over the next ten years, it would be necessary to upgrade training



- 8 -
of these unqualified teachers and train an additional 11,000 teachers to
adequately staff Malawi's primary schools. To help meet these needs, the
proposed project includes the construction, equipping and furnishing of a new
teacher training college to produce about 200 teachers annually. A demon-
stration primary school would be attached to the college. The staffing of
the college would be financed by the Government with bilateral assistance
during the initial years. On-going teacher upgrading programs graduate
about 300 teachers annually while existing teacher training colleges graduate
about 700 teachers annually. These programs would be graduating enough
teachers to meet Malawi's requirements. Since the existing teacher training
colleges are in the southern half of the country, the new college would be
located in the northern region. This would help the Government's conti-
nuing efforts to integrate the economic development of all regions of the
country and open up the rural areas. Because of the sparse population
of the northern region, boarding facilities for 420 students and houses
for 41 staff members would be built under the project. The provision of
the housing facilities is also consistent with existing Government policy
under which all intermediate and high level civil servants, teachers, and
other senior Government workers are provided with housing. This policy
enhances teachers incentives and gives the Government a greater flexibility
in assigning teachers to remote rural schools and has eliminated the need
for hardship or housing allowance.
Secondary Schools
28.       Under the first IDA-financed education project, the Government
initiated a program to introduce practical subjects in secondary schools.
However, because of a shortage of facilities, the program has reached only
20 percent of the secondary school enrollment. The Government aims at in-
creasing the coverage of the program to 40 percent of secondary school
enrollment by 1980. The proposed project would support this effort by
providing equipment and facilities for practical studies in seven secondary
schools, and boarding facilities for the increased student enrollment of
1,800, and housing for the required staff. Three of these schools would
be equipped with facilities for commercial training. In order to increase
the number of females in the skilled labor force, six of the schools would
be for girls (1,600 of the 1,800 additional places to be provided) while
the seventh would be co-educational. All the secondary schools are located
in rural areas and would draw students from very wide geographical areas.
Each school would therefore be provided with boarding facilities for students
and houses for the teaching staff. The drop-out rate from secondary schools
is currently only 10 percent for girls' schools with boarding facilities
and about 90 percent for those without boarding faci:Lities.
Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
29.       A PIU was established in the Ministry of Works and Supplies under
the first IDA-financed education project. However, on completion of the
project, the Unit was largely dismantled and only one architect remains.



The PIU would be strengthened and transferred to the Ministry of Education
to continue the coordination and execution of investments in the educational
sector. The proposed Credit would finance the services of a Project Manager,
three architects, a quantity surveyor, a procurement specialist, two drafts-
men and a bookkeeper. The latter three would be Malawian counterparts
of the expatriate personnel. The Project Manager is expected to be a
Malawian national and, along with the main architect and the procurement
officer, would be appointed under terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Association (see Section 3.06(a) of the Development Credit Agreement).
In view of the important role of the PIU in the implementation of the
proposed project, the Credit Agreement would not become effective until
the PIU has been formally established and the Project Manager, project
architect, project accountant and a procurement officer have been appointed
to the staff of the PIU (Section 5.01 of the Credit Agreement). The
Government also intends to train five Malawians as draftsmen during
the next five years for the PIU and to assign to the PIU, two Malawian
architects who are currently studying outside Malawi and are expected to
return to Malawi in 1976. These staffing arrangements are satisfactory.
Preparation of Future Educational Projects
30.       As the proposed project is part of Malawi's long-term investment
program for the educational sector, it i-ncludes preparation for future
projects and support for the manpower studies discussed in paragraph 17
above.
Project Implementation
31,        The PIU would have overall responsibility for implementing all
aspects of the project except the pre-investment studies. The Unit would
design and supervise the construction works on all the model primary schools
and the rural education centers, Consultants would design and supervise the
construction of all the other buildings. The manpower studies would be or-
ganized and administered by the Planning Division of the Ministry of Educa-
tion. The project would be implemented over a five-year period (1975-80).
Most of the model primary schools are expected to be completed within the
first three years after the Credit Agreement becomes effective. A total of
12.5 man-years of technical assistance services are expected to be employed
for the implementation of the project, Civil works would be undertaken by
contractors.
Project Costs and Financing
32.       The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$14.5
million (net of taxes) including an estimated US$7.5 million (or about
52 percent) in foreign exchange. The breakdown of estimated project costs
is given in Annex III. The proposed credit of US$11.6 million would finance



- 10 -
80 percent of the total net-of-taxes project cost and would cover the
required foreign exchange and about 58 percent of the local costs. Retro-
active financing of about $120,000 is recommended for consultants' services
and the initial operating expenses of the PIU incurred since July 1, 1975.
Procurement
33.       Contracts for civil works, furniture and equipment will be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines for procurement except that (a) civil works
costing less than US$200,000, (b) furniture and equipment contracts
costing less than US$50,000, and (c) locally procured materials will
be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally.
Domestic manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a
preference of 15 percent over the c,i,f. price of imports or the appli-
cable customs duty, whichever is lower over the cost of competing foreign
suppliers. Domestic contractors would be allowed a preferential margin
of 7-1/2 percent over bid prices of competing foreign contractors,
Disbursement
34.       The proceeds of the proposed credit would be disbursed against
(a) furniture and equipment: 100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures
or 75 percent of local expenditures (estimated equivalent of the ex-factory
costs); (b) technical assistance and professional services: 100 percent
of foreign exchange expendittures or 75 percent of local expenditures; and
(c) civil works: 75 percent of total expenditures.
Benefits and Justification
35.       The proposed project would provide facilities to expand and
strengthen on-going educational development programs and would help meet
the rapidly increasing demand for skills and qualified primary school
teachers. It would extend the teaching of practical and commercial sub-
jects to more primary and commercial schools, In addition, the project
would reduce socio-economic disparities by increasing the enrollment of
girls in secondary schools, assisting the promotion of secondary education
in rural areas and, through the Rural Education Centers, by teaching rural
adults the basic skills they require for productive self-employment,
36.       The principal risk involved in the proposed project relates to
the rural education centers which would introduce an innovative element
into Malawi's educational system. Although the structure and programs out-
lined for the centers have been successfully applied in other East African
countries, considerable coordination among Ministries and other government
agencies would be required at the District level, Some of the centers may
place greater emphasis on the use of the facilities for primary school
students and neglect the non-formal programs for adults. The PIU and the
Association, through regular supervision missions, would work closely with
the centers to minimize this risk.



PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
37,       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Malawi and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a Resolution approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.   Features of the draft Development Credit
Agreement of special interest dealing with the staffing, responsibilities
and powers of the Project Implementation Unit are discussed in paragraphs
29 and 30 of this Report. Establishment of the Project Implementation
Unit and the appointment of the Project Manager, project architect, project
accountant and a procurement officer to the staff of the PIU have been
specified as additional conditions to the effectiveness of the Credit
Agreement (Section 5.01 of the Credit Agreement).
38.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 102-MAI Education: $6.3 Million Credit of May 4, 1967;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project consists of the construction and equipping of one
national primary teacher training college and the provision of technical
instruction facilities in 12 secondary schools. The project has been
implemented satisfactorily and school premises have been in use for about
two years. A request from the Government to use savings under the credit,
amounting to about US$420,000 for the construction of a post and telecommu-
nications school to be jointly used by Malawi, Botswana, Lesotho and
Swaziland was agreed to by the Executive Directors on December 4, 1973.
The Closing Date has consequently been further postponed to June 30, 1977.
Implementation of the telecommunications school is progressing satisfactorily.
Credit No. 244-MAI Agriculture - Lilongwe Land Development Program
Phase II: $7.3 Million Credit of May 13, 1971;
Closing Date: March 31, 1976
The project is the second phase of a long-term program for small-
holder development and covers an additional 375,000 acres as well as the
establishment of a 160,000 acre cattle ranch. The project is progressing
well although difficulties were experienced during the 1974/75 season with
obtaining fertilizers and other inputs. Filling management trainee posts
with suitable Malawians, remains a problem.
Credit No. 282-MAI Agriculture - Karonga Development Project: $6.6 Million
Credit of January 26, 1971; Closing Date: December 31,
1977
The project is the first phase of an agricultural development
program for the Karonga area. It includes development of irrigated rice
cultivation, dry-land crop production, livestock development, extension
services, credit, health services and the rehabilitation of freight service
on Lake Malawi. In spite of a slow start due to delays in recruiting senior

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

staff and in the construction program the project has made reasonable
progress. Some reduction of physical targets is however necessary, and due
to cost escalation the project period may have to be reduced from five to
four years. Preparation of a second phase project is scheduled to be
appraised in October/November 1975.
Credit No. 363-MAI Agriculture - Shire Valley Development Project
Phase II: $10.5 Million Credit of March 28, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project is a continuation and an expansion of the program com-
pleted under Phase I and includes extension services, credit and marketing
facilities, a livestock component, health facilities, fisheries development,
feeder road construction, research on irrigated and rainfed crops, land re-
gistration and wildlife protection. Implementation of the project is on
schedule.
Credit No. 426-MAI Second Power Project: $7.5 Million Credit of
September 7, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project provides part of Malawi's power generation development
program for the period 1973-1977 and consists of: (a) the construction of a
barrage and 20 MW hydroelectric power station at Tedzani, as an extension
to the station financed under Credit 178-MAI; (b) the installation of a 12 MW
gas turbine, to be constructed at Blantyre; and (c) a tariff study. The pro-
ject is being financed jointly with CDC which will lend up to US$6.1 million
equivalent. As a result of recent world-wide increases in prices, a cost over-
run is anticipated. Measures to meet this cost overrun are discussed with the
Government. In spite of the cost overrun, the project remains the best choice
among the various alternatives to meet projected power demand.
Credit No. 2-17-MAI Transport Engineering and Services Project: US$2.0 Million
Credit of June 13, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project would determine the infrastructural requirements and
provide technical assistance for the exploitation of the Viphya forest
resources. Necessary transportation studies, design of the required trans-
port facilities have been completed and work nearly completed on the prepa-
ration of bid documents. VIPCOR, the Malawi organization which is in charge
of the Viphya project is in the process of selecting financing and technical
partners for the Viphya project.
Credit No. 523-MAI Second Highway Project: US$10.0 Million Credit of
December 19, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The contract for the civil works under this project has been
awarded and construction works are on schedule. Implementation of the District
Roads Pilot Program is also on schedule.
