PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALAWI SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(Credit 590-MAI)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Second Education
Project in Malawi, for which Credit 590-MAI was approved in November 1975 in the
sum of US$11.6 million. Credit disbursments of $11.42 million were completed on
June 15, 1982 and the remaining balance of US$0.18 million was thereafter
cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by Bank staff and a consultant following a
mission to Malawi in November/December 1981. The Borrower was sent the draft
PCR but made no comments.
The valuable assistance of the Government of Malawi in preparing
this report, particularly the Project Implementation Unit, is gratefully
acknowledged.
The project has not been subjected to an audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NA.LAWI SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
____  (Credit 590-MAlT)
The Credit Agreenent for the Second Malawi Education Project
(CR. 590-MAI) signed on November 24th, 1975 provided for a credit of
US$15.0 million to assist the Government of Malawi in meeting its
educational p-rograms as contained in its 1973-1980 Education Plan.
The project was intended to: (a) provide prototype models of primary
schools; (b' strengthen the program of rural education; (c) establish
a new Primary Teacher Training College; (d) add facilities for the
teaching of practical subjects in seiected secondary schools with
emphasis on facilities for girls; and (e) reinforce the capabilities
of the Mtinistry of Education and Culture (MEC) to administer and
prepare development projects.  The project was modified in January
1979 to include support for the upgrading of the computer equipment
used for the processing of examination papers at the MCETB and the
construction of ten additional staff houses at the secondary schools
(PCR, para. 3.15)1 The project was closed December 31, 1981 - nine
months beyond the original March 31, 1981 Closing Date (PCR, para.
The project was satisfactorily implemented and achieved most of
its ob4ectives.  As prototype for the testing of building designs and
materials specif½cations for community self-help construction, the
model primary schools have been useful.  From the lessons learned, the
building design and specifications for primary schools have been
modified and the Third Education Project (910-MAI & EEC-12 MAI) has
benefitted from the experiment and includes construction of 1,000
primary schools classroom on self-help basis (PCR, paras. 6.01-6.04).
The rural education or Adult Edu-cation Program component was not
successful (PCR, paras. 6.05-6.06). The Adult Education Centers
for non-formal educatlion are being used only occasionally. The
organized programs envisaged at appraisal have not materialized. A
retrospective review indicates that the mEC was not convinced that the
AECs were necessary but agreed Lo it so as not to prejudice the
primary school component of the project. in any case, the MEC has no
responsibility for non-formal adult education and the responsible
Ministries lacked the commitment to develop programs and provide
budgets for the recurrent costs. The inclusion of this component in
the project was noted to be a principle risk since it was introducing
an innovat`ive element in the education system (PCR, para. 3.14).  The
probl-em is now being addjressed (PCR, para. 6.05).
The Primary Teacher Trainiirg College was successfully
implemented (PCR, paras. 6.07-6.12). However, at the time of the
Completion !tission, there was some overcapacity due to shortage of
secondary schocl graduates willing to go into teaching.  The situation
as exNpected to improve in the future as a result of ongoing secondary



- vi -
school expansion programs. The project successfully assisted the
expansion of the seven secondary schools by improving basic science
facilities and by extending the diversified curriculum through the
provision of facilities for agriculture, commercial homecrafts and
technical workshops (PCR, paras. 6.13-6.17). However, the primary
objective of redressing the imbalance of secondary school
opportinities for girls was only partially successful in that the
anticipated increase of total female enrollment from 27.5% to 35% by
1980, did not materialize (PCR, para. 6.13 and 6.17). However the
overall quality of education for girls has improved considerably.
Other points of special interest are:
(a) The inadequate arrangements for maintenance of secondary
school facilities in grant-aided secondary schools: (PCR, 4.14);
(b) That although the project through the provision of computer
equipment for the MCETB has played a crucial role in educational
institution building, a major oversight is lack of fellowship training
for computer maintenance personnel (PCR, para. 4.18); and
(c) The need to review the educational objectives of the MPSs as
it relates to the teaching of practical subjects (PCR, para. 6.02).



I. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Summary
1.01      Project Objectives and Content - The principal objective of the
Second Education Project in Malawi was to provide assistance to implement
the Government's 1973-1980 Education Plan by: (a) strengthening on-going
rural education programs; (b) improving the quality of primary school
buildings and access to primary education; (c) expanding primary teacher
training facilities and secondary school enrollment particularly for girls;
and (d) reinforcing the capability of the Ministry of Education and Culture
(MEC) to administer and prepare development projects.
1.02      The project as approved included:
(a) The construction, furnishing and equipping of: (i) 22 new
prototype primary schools which would serve as models to be
replicated by local communities; (ii) 22 new rural education
centers; (iii) one new teacher training college including a
demonstration school, boarding facilities and staff houses; and
(iv) additions to seven secondary schools including boarding
facilities and staff houses.
(b) A proQram to train Malawian draftsmen for future employment by
the Project Implementation Unit (PIU); and a program to prepare
future educational projects in Malawi.
1.03      Model Primary Schools (MpSs)l/ - As prototypes for the testing
of building designs and materials specifications for community self-help
construction, the MPSs have served a useful purpose.  The building design
and specifications have been modified from the lessons learned and the
Third Education Project (910-MAI & EEC-12MAI) includes 1,000 primary school
classrooms to be constructed by rural communities on a self-help basis.  As
models for the introduction of practical subjects into primary schools they
have demonstrated that in the absence of complementary programs for adults
through joint use of staff, facilities and equipment, they are not
economical. As standard primary schools, they have functioned very well;
although enrollments exceed rated capacities, the success rates of their
students on examinations compare favorably with national averages (paras.
6.01 - 6.04).
1.04      The Adult Education Centers (AECs)2/ - Each Center located in
conjunction with a MPSs consists of a covered assembly area and shared use

Schools.
2/ The rural education centers are officially known as Adult Education
Centers.

of the primary school's workshops, homecraft units, classrooms and other
facilities. Some two years after the opening of the institutions, the
adult education facilities are being used only occasionally for church
services, community organization meetings and prenatal and other clinics
for mothers.  The organized programs envisaged at appraisal have not
materialized.  The AECs came about because of the Bank's concern for rural
development and equality of opportunity for the rural population, with the
knowledge that the rapidly growing general population would of necessity be
absorbed in rural agricultural activities. A retrospective review however
indicates that the MEC was not convinced that a project of this nature
could provide the necessary leadership to nonformal education, but in order
not to prejudice the project, it acceded to the suggestion that AECs could
be grafted onto the MPSse As noted above, this was done without conviction
on the part of the MEC, which in any case has no responsibility for adult
or nonformal education, and without the necessary commitment on the part of
the responsible Ministries, mainly the Development Division of the Office
of the President, to develop programs and provide budgets for recurrent
costs (Para 6.05). Only now is the problem being addressed, and
considering its complexity and budgetary constraints, it is unlikely that
dramatic results can be anticipated in the near future.
1.05      The Primary Teacher Training College (PTTC) along with its
associated demonstration school is a model of successful implementation of
an education project component. The institution opened on schedule with
the necessary staff and administrative support; enrollments and outputs
approximate capacities, and teachers are being trained in the revised
primary school curriculum. The PTTC, located in Mzuzu, is helping
alleviate the serious shortage of trained primary teachers. In 1980-81 it
provided about 30% of the output of the six teacher training colleges in
the country.  However, it does not entirely meet the anticipated shortage.
Appraisal projections of teacher requirements fell far short of needs
because attrition had been underestimated and the actual supply of teachers
from the other colleges and from the upgrading program of the Malawi
Correspondence College (MCC) was overestimated by about 30%. Furthermore,
the Government's plan to build another large teacher training college from
its own funds did not materialize.  At appraisal, it was anticipated that
the ratio of students enrolled in the two levels of teacher training
programs (T2 to T3 student teachers) 3/ would be 2:1; in the event, the
ratio was actually 1.4. The shift in distribution is attributable mainly
to the lack of MCE graduates qualified for, and interested in, teacher
education. This is a necessary accommodation to the realities of the
shortage of secondary school graduates (Paras. 6.07 to 6.12). The rising
proportion of less well qualified teachers is expected to be addressed by
the proposed Fifth Education Project.
3/ T2 or T3 certification follows successful completion of the two-year
primary teacher training programs which are offered to persons
possessing the Malawi Certificate of Education (MCE) and Junior
Certificate of Education (JCE) respectively.

1.06      Secondary School Extensions - The Project has successfully
assisted the expansion of seven secondary schools by improving basic
science facilities and by extending the diversified curriculum through the
provision of facilities for agricultural, commercial, homecraft and
technical workshop facilities. The primary objective of redressing the
imbalance of secondary school opportunities for girls has been partially
achieved. However, female enrollees in these facilities were transfers
from existing Government day secondary schools and their places were taken
up by boys. Female enrollment rose from 27.5% of total enrollment in 1975
to 29% in 1981. This was far short of the appraisal estimate of 35% by
1980. However the quality of girls education has improved. Supervision of
secondary education has been improved through the appointment of additional
education officers and inspectors in the regions and the strengthening of
the central administrative, curriculum development and supervisory
capabilities of the special subjects areas has been facilitated (Paras.
6.13 to 6.17).
1.07      Project Implementation - A PIU re-established within MEC
administered the project with a high level of dedication and competence.
The design and supervision of construction of the PTTC and the
demonstration school and expansion of the seven secondary schools were
carried out by a local architectural firm while the design and supervision
of the construction of 22 MPSs/AECs were the responsibility of the PIU.
The project was satisfactorily implemented although there were delays in
the later stages of implementation due to the belated construction of 38
classrooms at the MPSs. This led to the extension of the Closing Date by
nine months from the original date of March 31, 1981 to December 31, 1981.
In October 1978, the Government requested the use of savings from the
technical assistance category to support the needed upgrading of the data
processing capability of the Malawi Certificate of Education and Testing
Board (MCETB), additional staff houseg for the secondary schools and
expansion of PTTC. This request was granted by the Bank Group in January
1979. The computer and related equipment for the MCETB were expeditiously
procurred and installed. The new equipment has helped to strengthen the
data processing capability of MCETB and is generally very supportive of
education development in Malawi. The ten additional Staff Houses were also
expeditiously completed, however the further expansion of the PTTC in
agreement with the Bank Group, was carried out under the Third Education
Project. The completion of the project took five and a half years instead
of the four and half years estimated at appraisal. Disbursement was
completed in June 1982.
1.08      Economic impact - It is difficult to evaluate the precise
economic impact of this project. No tracer survey ot primary school
leavers exists, and in any event, primary education is not intended to
prepare the recipients of such education for the labor market at least in
terms of specific skills. With regard to the secondary school graduates,
although funds were made available for a tracer survey, the results of the
survey of 1976 secondary school leavers conducted in 1978 are yet to be
analysed by the Government. However an analysis of the survey carried out



- 4 -
by Bank staff 4/ indicate almost full employment for those members of the
cohort not pursuing full time education. Furthermore, the economic and
social rate of return for secondary education in Malawi ranged between 14
percent and 21 percent depending on the assumption used.  The range of the
private rate of return was approximately double that of the social rate of
return. Given the acute shortage of middle and upper level manpower in
M4alawi 5/ there is no doubt that the economic benefit of secondary
education is high (Paras. 6.18 and 6.19).
Recommendations
1.09      Model Primary Schools - From  an educational standpoint, the MPSs
are not serving as models for future primary schools. High operating costs
and low utilization rates for the practical subject facilities preclude
their adoption for general introduction of practical subjects into the
primary school system. The MEC should analyze the problems of the
practical programs of the MPSs and if the final decision is to drop
practical subjects from the MPSs program, the existing practical subject
facilities could be used as classrooms (Para. 6.05).
1.10       A problem common to the school system generally and the MPS in
particular is the high repeater rate in standard eight where a 50% rate is
quite common. Some students are known to repeat standard eight as many as
four times in an effort to gain entry to secondary schools.  This is partly
due to the limited number of available Form 1 places compared to these
seeking entry into secondary schools and partly due to the students' poor
performance when taking the Primary School Leaving Certificate (PSLC)
examination. A high repeater rate causes distortion in enrollment in the
primary schools and it prevents the secondary schools from selecting the
best students from the primary schools. As more secondary school places
become available, repeater problems will become manageable. Meanwhile, it
is recommended that the Borrower rectify the situation by setting a limit
to the number of times a student may repeat standard eight (Para. 6.03).
1.11       Adult Education Centers - In view of the fact that the AECs are
not functioning as intended despite the creation of a National Advisory
Council of Education and Training 6/ to oversee their activities, the
Borrower should establish an inter-Ministerial task force to study the
feasibility of various program alternatives.  It is recommended that the
Borrower should consider joint use of these facilities as primary schools
and MCC. The workshops could then function as ordinary classrooms
(Para. 6.05).
1.12       Secondary Schools - The problems with the project'ssecondary
schools relate to the shortage of special subject teachers, inappropriate
equipment and facilities for commercial subjects, and poor maintenance of

facilities.  The shortage of specialized teachers will be rectified with
the teturn of the trainees dne too depart L-or Nairobi in mid-1982.  Given
that hFEC is, discontinu.nog the teaching of commercial subjects in new
g'-"eraL. secondary schools) the programs at the project's secondary schools
for girls are likely to be phased out. The typewriters should then be
moved to technical seco(adary schools where they would be better utilized
(Para. 6.17). This move would free the rooms for use as general subject
classrooms. The problem of poor maintenance in these schools should be
reviewed and the MEC should encourage the management of the assisted
secondary schools to provide essential minimum maintenance (para. 4.14).
1.13      MICETB - The MEC is now committed to electronic data processing.
It should be noted, however, that the limits of the data processing
capabilities of the computer are being reached because of: (a) the rapidly
rising volume of school examinations; and (b) the increasing
sophistication of selection programs for the education system and other
Government departments generally. The time constraints and the volume of
examination preparation, administration, scoring and selection at all
levels are such that contingency arrangements should be made against the
possibility of computer breakdown or loss of stored information as could
occur in the event of a serious fire. The MEC should also provide for
periodic independent assessment of the data processing capability of the
system in the face of rising use, increasing program requirements and the
rapid obsolescence of equipment (Paras. 3.15 and 4.18).
1.14      Lessons Learned for Project Design:  (a) To ensure successful
outcome of any project involving non-formal education, the Borrower must be
convinced of the need of the proposed investment in rural education.
The apparent reason for the poor utilization of the facilities provided for
adult education was the lack of conviction on the part of the relevent
authorities that the AECs were the best mode for delivering such education
to adults. Innovative programs including non-formal education require much
more attention during the planning and design stages preliminary to project
implementation. The inclusion of these innovative AECs was considered a
risk and it appears that more efforts should have been utilized by Bank
Group Supervisions Missions.
1.15     Lessons Learned for Future Projects:  (a) Given the severe
shortage of housing in rural areas in Eastern Africa, provision of staff
houses at schools located in rural areas should be accepted as an essential
requirement for their successful operation. Subsequent education projects
in Malawi should provide for an adequate number of teacher houses; (b)
whenever appropriate, funds for training of maintenance technicians
should be provided and advice of competent experts sought whenever the Bank
Group finances the purchase and installation of sophisticated equipment
such as a computer; and (c) given the particular importance of the computer
to the future development of education, and its general usefulness in the
processing of candidates selection for appointment into the civil service
and other agencies, serious consideration should be given to requests for
financing of such equipment in other countries.
1.16      Lessons Learned for Project Evaluation.  The capability of the
MEC to collect and evaluate educational statistics in order to determine
the economic imupact of educatiornal investments needs to be strengthened.



- 6 -
This has been done to some extent by the provision for technical assistance
to MEC under the Third Education Project.
II. INTRODUCTION
2.01      This completion report is based on the findings of a Bank Group
mission which visited Malawi in November/December 1981. The mission
reviewed the execution of the project in comparison with the Development
Credit Agreement, appraisal estimates, and agreed working papers and
analyzed the impact of the project institutions on education and manpower
development.
2.02      The report is based on: (a) information obtained from the Bank
Group files in Washington, particularly supervision and quarterly progress
reports and from a draft completion report prepared by the PIU; (b) visits
to project institutions; and (c) discussions with staff of PIU, and other
Government officials, principals, staff, and students of the project
institutions and Bank Group staff familiar with the project.
III. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Socio-Economic Setting
3.01      At the time the project was appraised in 1975, Malawi had been
independent for just over ten years. The growth rate of GDP in real terms
had averaged about 8% per annum since 1964, largely as a result of the
Government's careful economic management. By 1974 per capita GNP was
US$138 in current prices (US$195 in constant 1979 prices) and the
Government was no longer dependent on external assistance to support
recurrent expenditure.7/ Throughout the period of project implementation,
the economic policy pursued by the Government, which was export oriented,
centered on the development of agriculture and agriculture-based
manufacturing industries. To attract foreign capital and managerial
expertise, the Government supported an open market orientated economy, with
the private sector as the catalyst of growth. Public investment was
directed towards provision of essential infrastructure, public utilities,
and support services needed to implement the Government's development
policy. The result was the emergence of relatively efficient
import substitution and labor intensive industries.  At the same time the
social sectors were relatively neglected.
3.02      In education, Malawi has lagged behind other countries in
Sub-Sahara Africa of the same comparable per capita income levels because
of the lack of Government commitment to education. Between 1975 and 1980
the proportion of total Government expenditure (capital and recurrent)
devoted to education fell from 15.8% to 12.5%, despite considerable
economic progress. Between 1969 and 1979, GDP in real terms, grew at an
average rate of 5.5% per annum and per capita income at about 3% per
annum. By 1980, GNP per capita was US$234, in current prices (US$215 in
constant 1979 prices). However, the economy has remained highly vulnerable
to international price fluctuations, especially for tea and coffee, two of

time of independence until 1973.



the principal export commodities.  Since 1978, the country's balance of
payments and public finance situation has deteriorated, principally because
of the decline in tobacco prices and the doubling of the fuel import bill.
The Education Sector
3.03      The Ministry of Education and Culture is responsible for the
administration of all levels of formal education (Chart 1).   Local
authorities are responsible for the provision of primary school buildings
but the MEC is responsible for the training of teachers, for their salaries
and for the provision of instructional materials.
3.04      The main issues in the education and training sector in the
1970's were those related to the need for -improved quality and expansion of
primary and secondary education.  Other issues included the necessity for
expanded specialized training at various manpower levels including the
upgrading of skills of the rural population.
3.05      In 1975 at the time of appraisal, the quality of primary
education was lower than the level required to: a) provide basic literacy
to the population to further social and economic development; and b) to
serve as a base for further education and essential skill training. The
gross enrollment ratio at that time was 56%. Given competing demands for
available resources, it was felt that the most critical need of primary
education was for trained teachers and improved physical facilities. The
stock of teachers was about 11,000 of whom 20% had no teaching
certificate.  The output of the two teacher training colleges at Blantyre
and Lilongwe assisted under the First Education Project (Credit 102-MAI)
was not expected to meet the future needs of the system for trained
teachers.  Annual enrollment for the teacher training system and outputs
for the 1975-1980 period were projected at appraisal at 1900 and 700
respectively falling short of requirements by more than 30%.
3.06      Provision for the construction of primary schools has
traditionally been the responsibility of local communities through
self-help programs. The quality of the physical facilities provided
through this system depended on the level of income of the communities
concerned.  In general, however, the physical facilities of primary
education were below the accepted norms for adequate learning to take
place. Many buildings were decaying and in danger of collapse and most
schools had little or no furniture.  Aware of the situation, the PIU's
architects designed four prototype primary schools to serve as models for
self-help construction efforts of local communities. One of these designs
was selected for the 22 primary schools included in the Second Education
Project (Para 4.10).
3.07      After independence in 1964, enrollment in secondary education
increased rapidly from 3,100 to 14,000 in 1975. However, the output of
secondary school graduates was far below the level required to supply the
needs of the labor market. Low enrollment in secondary education was also
affecting the entire school system.  At the primary level, about one half
of total enrollment in standard eight consisted of children repeating the
year in order to improve their score in the Primary Leaving School



Certificate (PLSC) to try to secure a place in secondary schools. This
situation has not changed. In 1975, given the limited financial resources,
it was felt that the most critical need was to improve access of girls to
secondary schools since only 20% of total secondary school enrollment were
girls and the majority of them were in Government-assisted church-managed
secondary schools with antiquated facilities. The Second Education Project
was expected to increase the number of secondary school places available to
girls as well as improve the physical facilities of existing girls schools.
3.08      The non-formal Adult Education system at the time of appraisal
was administered by at least eleven ministries and agencies with
identifiable but overlapping responsibilities (Annex 1).  The net result
was a series of programs which offered rural staff training to a large
number of adults with little coordination among the various agencies. A
national Council of Education and Training was established by the
Government in 1975 to coordinate training activities of the various
ministries. However, this council has functioned as an advisory council
only for technical and apprenticeship training. The AECs in the Second
Education Project were to provide a vehicle for coordination of rural adult
education at the district level.
Project Identification
3.09       In September 1972, a Bank Group sector review mission visited
Malawi and, in addition to data collection, discussed the Government's
education policy and strategies. This was a follow-up to an earlier
project identification mission conducted by a University of Manchester team
at the request of and with funding provided by the Bank Group. Subsequent
to the preparation of the draft Education Plan 1973-1980, a Bank Group
reconnaissance/identification mission visited Malawi in April 1973 to
discuss a possible education project focusing on the areas identified by
the Government. Further field discussions on project components were held
in November 1974 and in January 1975. Finally, in early 1975 the
Government formally requested the Bank Group to assist in the financing of
a project composed of a primary teacher training college, including a
demonstration school, expansion of six girls boarding secondary schools,
one coeducational boarding secondary school and 22 low cost prototype
(model) primary schools.
3.10      During appraisal the project content was modified to include:
(a) the addition of a rural adult education center to each of the 22
primary schools; and (b) the re-establishment in the MOE and the
strengthening of an existing Project Implementation Unit.  Negotiations
were held in September 1975.  The Development Credit Agreement, signed on
November 24, 1975, provided US$11.6 million and stipulated, as a condition
of effectiveness, the establishment of a separate PIU within the MEC
staffed with a project director, architects, and other specialized staff
with qualifications acceptable to the Bank Group. All conditions precedent
to Credit effectiveness were satisfied within the specified date.
Other special covenants related to training of Malawian draftsmen for
future employment by the PIU and submission to the Bank Group within one
year, of a plan of operations including financial proposals for replication
of the model primary school facilities.

Project Objectives
3.11      The project was designed to assist the Government of Malawi in
meeting its educational investmuent program as contained in its 1973-1980
Education Plan.  The aims of the plan weroZ (a) to improve access to
education by expanding education opportunities; (b) to reorient the content
and increase the effectiveness of educational programs by supporting the
diversification of the curricula; and (c) to provide the country with the
trained personnel needed to meet the various levels and types of required
manpower. Within these broad objectives, the project would assist the
education program by: (i) providing prototype construction models of
primary schools;  (ii) strengthening the programs of rural education; (iii)
establishing a new primary teacher training college; and (iv) adding
facilities for the teaching of practical subjects in selected secondary
schools with emphasis on facilities for girls.
Project Content
3.12      Specifically, the project as approved consisted of the following:
a)   The construction, furnishing and equipping of: (i) 22 new
prototype primary schools which would serve as models to be
replicated by local communities; (ii) 22 new rural education
centers; (iii) one new teacher training college including a
demonstration school, boarding facilities and staff houses;
and (iv) additions to seven secondary schools including
boarding facilities and staff houses.
b)   A program to train Malawian draftsmen for future employment
by PIU and a program to prepare future educational projects
in Malawi.
3.13      The project was expected to provide 9,200 additional student
places at primary level, 480 places at the Primary Teacher Training College
and 1,800 new student places at the secondary schools.
3.14      The 22 new prototype (model) primary schools (MPSs) were to serve
as a model both from an educational standpoint (i.e. instruction of
practical subjects) and construction wise in each district for self-help
replication. The AECs which were to be adjacent to the primary schools
were envisaged as centers where a variety of courses essential to rural
communities would be offered and coordinated by the local councils. These
courses included literacy campaigns, preventive health and nutrition
programs of the Ministry of Health, leadership and home craft training of
the Ministry of Community Development and Social Services, and extension
services including farmer training, animal husbandry, marketing and other
training schemes of the Ministry of Agriculture. These activities were to
be coordinated by the Local Council and MEC. Central coordination was to
be achieved through a newly created National Council of Education and
Training. The nonformal component of the project (the AECs) was expected
to reach 20,000 adults a year. The inclusion of the AECs was considered as
a risk since it would introduce an innovative element into the education
system.

Modifications to the Project
3.15      The processing of examination papers and the selection of
candidates for entry to junior and senior levels of secondary education are
the responsibility of the MCETB. During project generation and appraisal
there was not an immediate need for further improvement to the existing
system of processing examinations. In early 1978, it became apparent that
the data processing capability of MCETB needed upgrading. In October of
that year, the Government requested the use of part of the anticipated
savings from the technical assistance component of the Project to support
the upgrading of computer equipment, inter alia, at the MCETB (Para. 4.18).
In addition, the Government requested that a portion of the expected
savings be made available for construction of ten additional staff houses
at the secondary schools and a further expansion of the PTTC. These
requests were approved by the Bank Group on January 22, 1979. However, at
the negotiation in April 1979 for the Third Education Project it was agreed
that the further expansion of the PTTC would be financed under the Third
Education Project.
3.16      The original Closing Date of the project was March 31, 1981.  The
date was extended to December 31, 1981 at the request of the Borrower in
order to allow for the completion of 38 classrooms which had been initially
deferred from the MPSs construction program by the Borrower (Para. 4.13).
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Overview
4.01      The Development Credit Agreement became effective as scheduled on
February 24, 1976 and within a short time, most of the technical staff of
the PIU were recruited and in post. Design of the physical components by
the consultant was completed by the third quarter of 1976 for the PTTC and
by the first quarter of 1978 for the secondary schools. Construction of:
(a) the PTTC was completed by the end of 1978 - a year earlier than
anticipated at appraisal; and (b) the secondary schools - five months later
than originally estimated. There was some delay in start-up work for the
MPSs and AECs due to a one year delay in replacing the Unesco architect in
the PIU whose contract was not renewed in 1977. A further delay was caused
by difficulties over the lack of counterpart funds in FY79/80 to complete
the full complement of classrooms for the MPSs and the AECS.  As a result,
the Closing Date was postponed by nine months to December 31, 1981.
Project Administration
4.02      A Project Implementation Unit had been established within the
Ministry of Works and Supplies (MOWS) to administer the First Education
Project. As the First Education Project neared completion, the staff of
the PIU was gradually reduced. To implement the Second Education Project,
the PIU was re-established in the MEC with additional staff to be
recruited. The PIU's function was to oversee the implementation of the
project, train counterparts to replace, indue course, the expatriate
architects and procurement specialist and to help establish an effective
school building unit to assist in standardizing the design of education



- 11 -
facilities which could be replicated.  Shortly after the project became
effective, the PIU moved into adequate premises in Blantyre, with
sufficient offices and warehouse space, and later, a sub-office was
established in Lilongwe.
4.03      Staffing - In the early stages of project implementation, the PIU
consisted of a project manager, an accountant and support staff (all
Malawians), a senior architect (Unesco) and two architects and a quantity
surveyor provided by the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation
(CFTC), and a senior procurement officer provided by the Overseas
Development Administration (ODA).
4.04      The contract of the Unesco recruited senior architect was
terminated in September 1977 after one year because of the Government's
wish to fill this post utilizing less expensive bilateral aid. The vacant
post was belately filled one year later by an architect recruited and
financed by DANIDA. The contracts of the CFTC financed quantity surveyor
and the two architects ended in September 1978 and 1980 respectively and
were not renewed due to aid reduction at that organization. However, one
of the two architects agreed to continue to work in the PIU under local
terms and conditions. In November 1979, as a result of additional work
created by the Third Education Project which became effective that year,
the PIU was strengthened with two additional architects and one engineer
all provided by DANIDA. In August and October 1981, an architect and a
quantity surveyor financed by the Government of Japan and CFTC
respectively, were recruited.  In March 1983 a second architect from Japan
took up post. A Malawian deputy manager was appointed to the PIU in early
1980 when the present manager indicated his intention to retire. A number
of clerks of works were attached to the MPSs/AECs construction sites. The
PIU was adequately staffed during implementation and it executed the
project very efficiently. Because of the technical staff's heavy workload
in the early stage of project implementation, the proposed school building
unit did not materialize until the Third Education Project became effective
on September 4, 1979. Basically with the exception of the training of five
Malawian draftsmen which is taking longer than originally envisaged (para.
4.05), institutional building of the PIU can be judged to be very good.
4.05       Staff Training - A program to train Malawian draftsmen as
architectural assisrants for future employment in the PIU was belately
established in late 1978 when three local draftsmen joined the PIU. One of
them has completed a two-year advanced course in the United Kingdom and a
second is planning to enter the University. Therefore, for the foreseeable
future, the PIU will remain dependent on expatriate architects due
basically to the lack of interest by Malawians in joining the PIU because
of low salaries vis-a-vis private industry.
Preinvestment Studies
4.06       Since the project was part of a long term investment program, it
included funds to support: (a) preinvestment studies which included the
preparation of future education projects, and (b) tracer studies and other
methods of project evaluation. The Third Education Project was
successfully prepared and appraised in late 1978. A tracer survey of 1976
secondary school graduates was completed in 1978.  The analysis of the
results by MEC was delayed until December 1981 due to lack of qualified



- 12 -
statisticians.  However, preliminary analysis of the data was completed by
Bank Group Staff 8/ in 1980 and made available to the Government.  In
retrospect, consideration should have been given to include funds for the
establishment of a project evaluation unit within MEC and technical
assistance towards its staffing. Alternatively, the Government should have
been encoiuraged to establish such a lnit and to seek bilateral aid for its
staffing.
Physical implementation
4.07       Sites - At the time of appraisal, suitable sites were available
for the seven existing secondary schools and the Mzuzu PTTC including a
demonstration school. Sites for the 22 MPSs/AECs were identified in early
1976, and the surveys were completed as scheduled in September 1977.
4.08       Architectural/Engineering Services - To facilitate start-up, the
Borrower obtained the services of a local firm of consultant architects to
carry out the design and supervision of the PTTC and the extensions of the
seven secondary schools. A locally-based architectural firm was nominated
by the Government in May 1975, however, the appointment was not finalized
until a month after the project became effective on February 24, 1976.
Therefore, provisions for rectroactive financing of these services was not
utilized. The Borrower was undoubtly reluctant to commit funds for these
services until Credit effectiveness was confirmed. The design and
supervision of construction of the remaining 22 MPSs/AECs was the
responsibility of the PIU.
4.09       Tender documents for the PTTC were completed in September 1976
and for the seven secondary schools in phases between February 1977 and
April 1978. The completion of the tender documents was, in comparison with
appraisal estimates, early for the PTTC but delayed about nine months for
the secondary schools. The delays were mainly due to the additional
requirements requested by the Borrower. The performance of the
consulting firm was considered to be very good.
4.10       The architects of the PIU developed four prototype designs for
the MPSs/AECs. Their designs ranged from a conventional type with
monopitch roof structure supported on brick walling to more unorthodox
types using cross-vaulting of local bricks surfaced with clay tiles. The
Government had planned to build one of each prototype in order to determine
which of the four designs would be most suitable and economical. However,
the Government decided to construct only the conventional type which was
deemed to be the most economic in cost and of the type most easily
republicated by local communities and the design was chosen to be used for
all 22 MPSs/AECs. In order to utilize the PIU's technical staff in the
most economical manner, it was decided that the 22 MPSs/AECs should be
implemented in three phases. Thae tender documents for the first phase were
completed in May 1977, followed by second and third phases in December 1977
and June 1978 respectively, the last phase being about 20 months behind the
appraisal schedule (Annex 2). The main reason for the delay was the late
8/    S.P. Heyneman:  The Evaluation of Human Capital in Malawi.  World
Bank Staff Working Papers No. 420, Oct. 1980.



- 13 -
arrival of the PIU architectural staff and the departure of the senior
architect in September 1977. The performance and quality of work provided
by the PIU architects were very good.
4.11      Generally, the physical facilities provided under the project are
functional, economical and simple in design. Teaching spaces, both in area
and layout for educational needs, serve their intended purpose (Annexes 3
and 4). Buildings for the PTTC and secondary schools have concrete floors,
brick walls (exterior and interior) and roof, finished with clay tiles on
structural corrugated aluminum sheets in order to reduce heat and noise
during the rainy season. The MPSs/AECs have concrete floor slabs, brick
walls (exterior and interior) and corrugated sheetmetal or asbestos roofing
on trusses made from local wood. Most of the schools have been in
operation for several years and the buildings demonstrate that they provide
year-round acceptable conditions of comfort in teaching and dormitory areas
without the need of cooling fans. Horizontal noise levels between
adjoining teaching rooms are acceptable. Landscaping for most of the
project components has been adequately carried out.
4.12      Construction - International competitive bidding procedures were
used for the PTTC and all secondary schools; but as there was no external
response, all contracts were awarded to locally established contractors.
The construction time for the PTTC was 23 months compared with the
appraisal estimate of 35 months. The secondary schools had an average
construction time of 22 months with the exception of two, where the
contractor went into bankruptcy about half way into the contract and a new
contractor had to be appointed, resulting in further delay. The Bank Group
agreed to a Government request (Para. 3.15) in January 1979 that some
project funds (expected savings) could be utilized for a further expansion
of the PTTC, and construction of additional 10 staff houses (total of
39) for the secondary schools. The construction work for the additional
houses was completed in May 1980. At the request of the Government, the
further expansion of the PTTC was carried out under the Third Education
Project (Para. 3.15).
4.13      The MPSs/AECs (excluding the demonstration school attached to the
PTTC) were tendered through local competitive bidding (LCB), but due to
lack of response from contractors, two of the schools located in remote
areas wereconstructed by the MOWS departmental forces using force account
procedures. The original project included construction of eight classrooms
at each of the 23 sites. Only at one site, the primary/demonstration
school attached to the PTTC, was the full complement of eight classrooms
constructed. For completion of the 22 schools, the PIU, partly from a
desire to stay within the budget and partly to try to stimulate "self-help"
in the communities, constructed on average only six classrooms per school
from the original tenders. The execution of the work was divided into
three staggered construction phases to correspond in part to the number of
available site supervisors in the PIU. Contracts awarded for three schools
were terminated due to non-performance of the contractor and were awarded
to other contractors, and one school had to be resited because of soil
problems. The construction time of the original contracts had an average
duration of 24 months in comparison with the appraisal estimate of 22
months. For economic reasons, the Government decided in 1977 that 38
classrooms in the MPSs/AECs would be constructed through community



- 14 -
self-help. In late 1980 when it became apparent that this labor was not
forthcoming, the Government decided to contract out the construction of
these classrooms.  Since no provision was made in the Government's budget
for this purpose at that time, construction was deferred to the next fiscal
year when funds would become available and required a postponement of the
closing date by nine months to December 31, 1981.  These classrons were
completed by September 1981.  On the whole, the contractors perforned well
and the quality of work is very good.  The implementation schedule and cost
of construction are given in Anexes 2 and 5 respectively.
4.14      Maintenance of Physical Facilities - The buildings as mentioned
above are of good quality.  However, some maintenance problems exist in the
secondary schools.  This is not a new problem.  The completion mission of
the First Education Project found similar inadequacies in the maintenance
of buildings and recommended that each school employ a handyman to carry
out the necessary repairs. Maintenance of all Government establishments is
carried out under the supervision of the regional engineers of MOWS againist
annual budgetary allocations covering all facilities. The maintenance of
the assisted secondary schools (operated by churches) is the responsibility
of the schools for which usually inadequate maintenance funds are provided
annually by their Boards of Governors. The MEC should encourage the
management of these assisted secondary schools to provide essential minimutm
maintenance.
4.15       Furniture and Equipment - The PIU prepared all furniture and
equipment lists including the tender documents and supervised all
procurement and distribution of the furniture and equipment to the various
institutions.  However, preparation of master lists did not commence until
January 1977 owing to the delay in recruitment of a senior procurement
officer. Approximately 94% of total furniture and equipment requirements
were tendered through ICB. In the case of furniture it was found that no
foreign bidder could compete with the locally based manufacturers and
consequently all furniture was supplied by Malawi registered companies.
All but 6% of equipment was procured through foreign suppliers. On
average it was found that only 25% of pre-registered suppliers responded to
tender documents.  The PIU experienced many minor difficulties in the
delivery of equipment from foreign suppliers, long delays at sea ports,
inefficient handling of insurance claims for equipment due to damage during
transportation, and including pilferage at the ports.
4.16       The locally procured furniture was in most part of good quality.
In the primary schools, costs were minimized by standardizing two sizes of
tables.  The completion mission found that in some instances certain items,
such as stools and tops of classroom tables were less durable than
expected.
4.17       The mission felt that the equiprment for project schools is, on
the whole, appropriate to the curricula and syllabi. However, primary
school homecraft centers were overstocked with inappropriate, unused
enamelled pots and additional needlecraft and dressmaking equipment could
have been better utilized. Tools for the MPSs/AECs program were well
selected for the activities described in the program, but there is
reservation about the program itself.  In the secondary schools, the
combined typing/clerical tables for the commercial program are less than



- 15 -
satisfactory and should be replaced. Moreover, as the tables were designed
for 12" carriage typewriters, they have become virtually unusable because
18" carriage typewriters were purchased in error. The equipment selected
for PTTC was entirely satisfactory.
4.18      The computer equipment for the MCETB was expeditiously procured
and installed. On the whole, this project item has played a crucial role
in educational institution-building. However, it is now recognized that
the lack of fellowship training for computer maintenance personnel was not
adequately evaluated.   Routine maintenance has been provided by
technicians of the Japanese Government Volunteers' program. The training
of local maintenance staff began only in FY81/82. In retrospect a computer
specialist should have been consulted for advice on the suitability of the
equipment purchased. The director of MCETB noted that the system has
often required repair thereby undermining the confidence of potential users
such as the National Statistical Office or the Center for Social Research
of the University of Malawi. In addition he expressed concern over the
weakness of the printing and graphics capability, too few terminals to
serve as entry points during peak periods, limited program design and
training capacity, and the lack of magnetic tape-drive back-up capacity.

Technical Assistance
4.19        Only one man-year of the 12.5 man-years of specialist services
originally included in the project was utilized because these services were
obtaiaed from bilateral sources (paras. 4.03 and 4.04). On the whole, the
specialists performed their duties with a high degree of professionalism.
The following table compares the planned and actual technical assistance
provided. Savings from this category were used to finance equipmaent for
the MCETB, additional staff houses for secondary schools and cost overruns
in several categories (page iv).

Covenants
4.20      The Borrower basically implemented the project with above average
diligence and efficiency.  The Borrower fully complied with article 4.02 of
the Credit Agreement which required that it review its manpower training to
ensure effective manpower utilization. A manpower survey was carried out
in 1979. Article 4.03 required that the Borrower furnish the Bank Group
for its review a plan of operation, including financial arrangements



- 17 -
for building additional school facilities following the model designed
under the project.  This covenant was fulfilled about one year beyond the
agreed date. The Third Education Project is assisting the Government in
the construction of 1,000 primary school classrooms based on a modified
design of the MPSs. By telex dated June 24, 1976, the Bank Group agreed to
a three month postponement of the time limitation for the employment of an
architect and a quanity surveyor for the PIU (Section 3.06 (a) of the
Development Credit Agrement). In summary, the Government basically
satisfactorily fulfilled all covenants.
Bank Group Performance
4.21       The project was supervised by 10 missions excluding the
completion mission. The interval between missions was five to ten months
with 78% in the five to six months bracket. The missions averaged six days
in the field with a minimum of three days and a maximum of nine days.
Architects participated in all the missions, general educators in five, a
technical educator in one and economists in three. During the period of
early implementation, supervision focused particulary on the physical
aspects of the project. In retrospect, the appraisal team appears to have
lacked a full understanding of the organizational structure of the Malawian
Government and to have been overly optimistic regarding the commitment on
the part of MEC and the Development Division of the Office of the President
to implement the educational objectives of the AECs. The carrying out of
this innovative program was recognized as the principal risk and
Supervision Missions could have reviewed this component more closely.
While supervision missions recognized that the enrollment of girls was not
increasing as a percentage of total enrollment as intended (para 6.13) this
was not formally discussed with to the Government. However, in general,
Bank Group staff supervising the project and Government officials
established and maintained an excellent relationship which enabled them to
anticipate and resolve potential problems, such as duplication of payment
to the firm supplying the computer equipment, and lack of provision of
counterpart funding in the Government budget for the full complement of
classrooms.
V. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
Capital Costs
5.01        Comparisons of estimated and actual costs of physical facilities
are shown in Annex 5. Total estimated costs including contingencies at
appraisal were MK12.5 million or US$15.0 million equivalent.  The Credit
allocation of US$11.6 million was to cover 77% of total estimated costs
including taxes (80% of total estimated costs excluding taxes).
The final cost of the project was MK12.4 million or about US$14.8 million
equivalent; US$11.4 million was disbursed from the Credit allocation which
represented about 77Z of the total project costs.

5.03      Compared with appraisal estimates including contingencies, three
categories (civil works, architectural/engineering services and project
administration) had cost overruns of which project administration was
significantly high.  The high cost overrun (about 130¼) of project
administration resulted from higher than expected costs of local staff of
the PIU. The other categories show savings, in particular the technical
assistance category (para 4.19). On the whole, however, the distribution
of funds between categories of expenditures at appraisal was about on
target (page iv).
Areas anic Costs per Student Place
5.04      Since the seven secondary schools are extensions to existing
facilities, only for the PTTC and MPSs/AECs can unit areas and costs per
student place be determined. These are contained in Annexes 4 and 5 and
are reasonable when compared with other similar type projects in the
Eastern Africa Region. It is estimated that through the use of
standardized designs (as developed by the PIU) about 15-20% of the capital
cost has been reduced, when compared with the cost of the previous
Government developed designs.
Disbursements
5.05      Althou-h the Credit's Closing Date was postponed from March 31
1981 to December 31, 1981 the Bank Group agreed that disbursements could be
continued for three months beyond the Closing Date.  Final disbursement
however occurred on June 15, 1982 with undisbursed funds of US$179,327.74
cancelled. A comparison of actual and estimated disbursements is
summarized on page (ii) of the Key Project Data. A comparison of the
original allocations and actual disbursements of the Credit proceeds by
category is also shown on page (iv) of the Key Project Data.
Recurrent Costs
5.06      Complete information on recurrent costs for the 22 MPSs is not
available. For FY1980/81, available information indicates that teachers'
salaries amounted to MK153,287 (US$180,337).  Since teachers' salaries in
primary schools traditionally account for about 90% of total central
Government recurrent expenditure for primary education, it can be inferred
that the recurrent cost of these project schools amounted to about
MK170,300 (US$200,360) or about 1.6% of total central Government recurrent
expenditure for the primary education sector. Unit recurrent costs for
these schools average MK13.7 compared to MK12.1 for the primary school
sector due to the fact that the project schools on the whole have a higher
proportion of qualified teachers than the average assisted primary school
9/ (Annex 6).
9/ Only 56% of the staff in project primary schools hold T3 or T4
certificates compared to 76% for the nation as a whole.



- 21 -
5.07      The seven secondary schools assisted in the project are
grant-aided schools.10/ Total Government grants to these seven schools
rose from MK118,318 in FY 1978/79 (4.2% of total secondary school
expenditure) to MK218,823 (7.2% of secondary school cost) in 1980/81 (Annex
6). The rise in the Government's share of secondary school expenditure is
due to increased enrollment in these schools as facilities became
available. Full utilization of these facilities in the future is likely to
require a slight increase of Government grants to these schools. Based on
fulltime enrollment of about 2,330 pupils in FY1980/81, recurrent costsper
pupil in these schools averaged about MK93.9 (US$110.5) compared to about
MK192.7 (US$226.7) for all Government and grant-aided secondary schools in
that year. The unit recurrent costs of these schools are
artificially low because grants to these schools cover only salaries of
teachers. Furthermore salaries of some of the teachers, especially those
belonging to religious orders, are met from fees and private grants from
religious groups.
5.08      The PTTC component of the project was completed in August 1978
and the facilities were immediately utilized. In FY 1978/79, total
recurrent costs were MK141,609 or 15.8% of total recurrent costs of primary
teacher trainin-.  By FY 1980/81, recurrent costs had risen to MK332,126 or
31.9% of total recurrent cost of primary teacher training 11/ (Annex 6).
The share of personal emoluments 12/ declined from 67.3% t7o34.7% during
the period while there was a corresponding increase in the share of "other
charges"13/- Expenditures on boarding and tuition are likely to increase
substanta4lly with full utilization of the facilities provided under this
project. Currently, the Mzuzu PTTC is still slightly underutilized since
facilities provided under this and a subsequent project (Third Education
Project) are intended for a total of about 540 students and enrollment in
1980/81 was about 498. Cost per trainee teacher at lizuzu PTTC in 1980/81
was MK673.7 (US$792.6) compared with the national average of MK555.2
(US$653.2). This figure is likely to decrease as enrollments increase and
the institution is utilized as planned.
VI. EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES
Primary Schools
6.01     The three basic goals of the primary school component were: (a)
expansion of practical subjects in the primary school curricula; (b)
expansion of enrollment in primary schools; and (c) the development of a
low cost functional building design and construction standards.
10/  Grant aided schools are privately managed schools with financial
support for the central Government.
11/  Enrollment at Mzuzu PTTC was approximately 28% of total enrollment at
teacher training institutions in 1980/81.
12/  Teachers' salaries.
13/  "Other charges" include salaries of non-established staff as well as
expenditure on minor works, and the cost of boarding and tuition.



- 22 -
6.02      With regard to the first of these goals, practical subjects
curricula prepared in cooperation with UNICEF are in use in all the
schools.  However, this goal has only been partially achieved and should be
carefully reviewed by the Government. Teaching of homecrafts/needlecrafts
for girls and arts and crafts for boys is restricted to the upper cycle of
the primary school and even then for two periods per class per week. As a
result, utilization rates for the workshops and homecraft facilities are
25% and 30% respectively of available time. Furthermore, the supply of
teaching materials as required by the curricula, especially for the
homecraft classes, is sporadic and local substitutes for some of the
materials unavailable. On the whole, it seems that the programs for the
practical subjects are of such high cost that countrywide replication as
intended is not possible. Typically, most teachers are T3s, and
particularly in the case of workshop teachers, well selected and trained.
A typical workshop teacher will have attended a two year teacher training
program having been selected from amongst MCE holders who attended
technical schools, followed by a six week course in technology upgrading,
and a two-week workshop in the teaching of technical subjects organized by
UNICEF.  Because of shortages of similarly trained women, there were more
unqualified teachers of homecraft.
6.03      As regards the Second goal, it was anticipated that the 22 MPSs
would accommodate 400 students each or a total of 8,800 students. In
FY1980/81, total enrollment in these schools was 12,465 or 50% higher than
rated capacity and 15.4% of total national enrollment in primary schools.
Four of the largest schools each with enrollments in excess of 800 were
using existing substandard classrooms. Eighteen schools enrolled 8,506
students - an average school enrollment of 473, 18% higher than the
anticipated capacity but within the norm for primary schools in Malawi
(Annex 7). Over-enrollment in these schools is attributed to: (a) the
superior accommodations which make them attractive to students outside the
immediate district environment; and (b) lack of limit to transfers and to
acceptance of new enrollees. However, there is heavy drop-out of over 50%
on average between standards I and 3 in the schools visited. In the
school system generally, high drop-out rates have been attributed in part
to the crowded conditions in schools, but in the case of MPSs the
headmasters reported that the fees (MK2.50 per annum in standards 1-5 and
MK4.50 in standards 6-8) are serious obstacles to students remaining in
schools. The impact of any proposal to increase revenues by raising
student fees should be carefully weighed. Furthermore, enrollments at
standard eight level are high because of high repeater rates, as high as
50% in some MPSs visited. Some students may repeat standard eight as many
as four times in an effort to gain entry to secondary schools. This is a
major issue in the school system as a whole and a policy ruling on the
number of times a student should repeat standard eight is required.
6.04       The Third goal to develop a low cost functional building design
and construction standards can be deemed to be successful. Based on the
experience of the program in this projectl, modifications have been
introduced to the design and standards of construction and an additional
1,000 classrooms are being constructed utilizing limited self-help in the
Third Education Project. The basic layout (facilities provided) has
however been revised and includes only the classrooms and auxiliary
facilities and does not include the practical workshops and covered area
which was to be shared with the AECs as described in paragraph 6.05 below.



- 23 -
It was envisaged that the communities would finance and build additional
primary schools using the prototype as a model. This was an over
optimistic assumption. However as a result of experience gaineds
a program of self-help has been developed with the development division of
the office of the President responsible for supervising construction
through district commissioners, including provisions of skilled labor.
Each local community is providing fired brick, sand, stone and unskilled
labor. The PIU in cooperation with the development division is providing
imported building materials, furniture and equipment and technical advise.
Adult Education Centers
6.05      The MPSs/AECs were intended to provide shared-use facilities, and
their programs were assumed to be mutually supportive. This has not proven
to be the case, and the practical subjects of the MPSs are threatened with
extinction because, in the absence of supportive activities, costs become
prohibitive. The AECs came about because of the Bank's concern for rural
development and equality of opportunity for the rural population, with the
knowledge that given the rapidly growing population, the majority of new
additions to the labor force would of necessity be absorbed in rural
agricultural activities. The MEC was not convinced that a project of this
nature could provide the necessary leadership to nonformal education.
However, according to Government officials, in order not to predjudice
the project, the MEC acceded to the suggestion that AECs and MPSs should
have joint facilities. The project manager in his completion report stated
that this was done without conviction on the part of the MEC, which in any
case has no responsibility for adult or nonformal education, and without
the necessary commitment on the part of the responsible agencies, in
particular the Development Division of the Office of the President, to
develop the necessary programs and provide funds for recurrent costs. Only
now is the problem being addressed and considering its complexity and
budgetary constraints, it is unlikely that dramatic results can be
anticipated in the near future. Should the Borrower not be convinced of
the viability of such a program(s), an alternative use of the facilities
should be explored such as use by the primary schools as classrooms to
reduce the overcrowding.
6.06      The joint MPSs/AECs program suffers from a number of fundamental
weaknesses:
(a)  It is unlikely that the same program, facilities, equipment,
syllabus and instructors could serve both the needs of primary
students and the adults of the community;
(b)  The cost of wood, metal and other expendable materials is
too high for general application in primary education. The
schools obviously are not models for the primary education
system in their present form and style of operation;
(c)  If programs of interest to adults could be developed, it would be
necessary to provide for separate financing, procurement,
delivery and storage of expendable materials. Provision would
have to be made for the maintenance of equipment and inventories
and replacement of items lost through attrition. These are not



- 24 -
insurmountable problems, particularly if the same instructor
could serve both programs. In this event outlays for salary and
housing for the instructor would also need to be shared, a
difficult process under present administrative compartment-
alization;
(d)  New programs need administrative representation in the
responsible Ministry to ensure that the program receives
appropriate recognition and budget. At present the program lacks
this representation;
(e) New programs require effective supervision directed to the
improvement of instruction. This element of support is lacking,
even in the case of primary schools, which do not have inspectors
qualified in the diversified program. The limited success of
womens' programs in the very few centers with such programs
provides support, the centers could be effectively utilized;14/
(f) Neither the National Advisory Council on Education and Training
nor the Program Evaluation Unit of the MEC appears to have
provided, as anticipated, the platform for useful dialogue among
Ministries for the promotion of AECs objectives since none of
these institutions ever really functioned.
Primary Teacher Training College
E.07      Enrollment - The 1975 appraisal mission found a projected
shortage of primary teachers that could be remedied by the construction of
a new teachers college with annual enrollment of 420 and outputs of 200,
respectively. In 1979 the appraisal mission for the Third Education
Project found a deteriorating situation with respect to the number of
qualified teachers available for the expanding pupil enrollment; the Third
Project accordingly provided for an expansion of the Mzuzu PTTC by an
additional 120 places to a total boarding capacity of 540 places and annual
outputs of about 250 qualified teachers.
6.08      The Mzuzu PTTC, including its later expansion, is proving to be
the keystone of primary teacher training. The facilities became available
in 1978 as scheduled, with the first graduates in 1980. The effect of
the expanded facilities came on stream one year later, thanks to the fact
that the original contractor was still on site and completed the extension
in 1979. In 1977, the Mzuzu PTTC contributed 20% of total primary teacher
output, and by 1980, the share of outputs had risen to 29% (Annex 8). The
Mzuzu PTTC is achieving over 90% of target enrollment and output of
qualified teachers. The ratio of T2 to T3 student teachers in the school
system has changed dramatically from 2:1 as anticipated during appraisal,
to 1:2 by 1980 and 1:4 by 1981.  The changing ratios are attributed to the
shortage of MCE candidates, which is in turn attributable to the lack of
places in general secondary schools.
14/ These programs occur in about 5 to 6 of the centers and are limited
to once a week during the months between planting and harvesting.



- 25 -
6.09      Internal efficiency - The Government, while making serious
efforts to improve the quality of primary education through improved
output of primary teachers, is aware of the fact that there is a savings in
the salary bill for T3 teachers. The PTTC administration considers that
although the T2 MCE holder is a preferred candidate from the point of view
of maturity and superior academic preparation, the T3 teacher is a
satisfactory alternative under present circumstances of short supply. The
selection of candidates by the MCETB has proven satisfactory, and the drop-
out rate between enrollment and completion is less than 2%, primarily for
personal or health reasons. The PTTC is internally efficient as revealed
by passing rates of 92% and 100% for T2 and T3 candidates respectively, who
took the certificate examinations. Those who fail are usually not lost to
the system, but enter teaching as T4 or unqualified teachers, and
subsequently qualify through the upgrading program of MCC (Annex 9).
6.10      An evaluation of the quality of outputs of Mzuzu PTTC as compared
with the existing older colleges is not available. The reputation of the
Mzuzu PTTC as a desirable alternative to further academic education is
growing with the result that more students are electing to apply for
teacher training as a preferred career. The District and Regional Officers
consulted stated that graduates are generally well selected, well trained
and interested teachers who are performing competently. This impression
was confirmed in interviews Bank staff have had with primary school
teachers.
6.11      The demonstration school is an integral part of the PTTC, coming
under its central administration and management. To the extent possible, a
demonstration school should be a microcosm of the primary school system as
a whole, but Mzuzu Demonstration School is in few respects typical of the
school environment that the new teachers may expect to find following
appointment. The Mzuzu Demonstration School has a total enrollment of
about 350. The student teacher ratio is 50:1 compared with the national
average of 65:1 15/. The demonstration school is the only purpose-built
institution of its type in Malawi, and will probably be the model for
future institutions. The facilities provided are modest and functional.
The most unusual design feature is the provision of galleries at the rear
of each classroom with separate entrances so that student teachers may
enter and observe classes without distracting them. Similarly student
teachers may be observed by teacher trainers without intrusion. It appears
to be an ideal teaching environment.
6.12      Many school systems throughout the world have adopted
alternatives to demonstration schools as a practical teaching resource
because of the necessary distinctions between the demonstration school and
real life. Demonstration schools are generally criticized on the basis
that pupils tend to become blase because of over-exposure to inexperienced
student teachers, and they tend to suffer from the loss of personal contact
with a full time teacher. However, the situation in Malawi is different.
Students in the Mzuzu Demonstration School are the regular students of the
catchment area and the superior environment should compensate for the
15/ The national pupil/qualified teacher ratio is 103:1; whereas all
teachers at the demonstration school are qualified.



- 26 -
catchment area and the superior environment should compensate for the
possible disadvantage of inexperienced teachers. Moreover, the cost and
limited availability of transport, and the unavailability of housing at
receiving schools prohibit other alternatives.
Secondary School Extensions
6.13      For the seven secondary schools, there were three basic goals:
(a) to rehabilitate and expand outmoded facilities in six girls schools and
one coeducational secondary school; (b) to provide more student places
particularly for girls in secondary schools; and (c) to diversify the
curriculum by adding facilities for the teaching of practical subjects in
these schools. With regard to the first objective, implementation has been
successful and this component benefitted from the experience of the First
Education Project. The quality of girls education has therefore improved.
With regard to the second objective, the intention was to add approximately
1,800 student places of which 1,600 places would be for girls, thereby
achieving a total enrollment of 2,660 in the seven schools and raising the
proportion of girls in secondary schools to 35% by 1980. In December 1981,
the enrollment target had not yet been achieved. The seven secondary
schools have a total enrollment of 2,330 compared with the appraisal
estimate of 2,660 (Annex 8). Furthermore, the newly created places for
girls were filled through systematic reduction in the number of girls in
Government day schools because of the superior boarding accomodation in the
project schools. For example, in 1975/76, 25% of the population in
Government day schools were girls, by 1979/80, it had fallen to 11.6% and
by 1980/81, only 8% of total enrollment in Government aided day schools
were girls.  On the other hand, there has been a rise in the share of girls
of the total enrollment in the boarding schools from a low 20% in 1975/76
to 52% in 1980/81. For the school system as a whole, the appraisal
estimate that the proportion of girls in the school system would rise to
35% by 1980 has not been achieved. In 1980/81, only 29% of total
enrollment were girls; an increase of only 1.5 percentage points over what
it was in 1975/76. As more secondary school places become available, the
situation is expected to improve.
6.14       The third objective of furthering the policy of diversifying the
curriculum in secondary schools has had limited success. With respect to
the workshop program at one of the schools (Robert Laws Secondary School)
the only coeducational school, significant changes have been introduced,
rectifying some of the problems encountered in the First Education
Project.  Although the First Education Project aimed at introducing
industrial arts into the secondary schools, during implementation the
program became distorted through the equipment selection process. As a
result the workshops are more appropriate for a more advanced technical
program than for secondary schools. Some of the heavy machine shop
equipment of the First Education Project was redistributed to other
schools, in this instance to Robert Laws Secondary School. This made it
possible for the school to introduce a broader range of technologies,in
accordance with the general education objectives of industrial arts.
Although the school was not in operation at the time of the completion
mission, its workshop is more functional than those of the First Education



- 27 -
Project, and moreover is staffed with qualified teachers. The new workshop
is a step in the right direction, and will be further improved under the
general revision of the curriculum still in progress, providing for the
introduction of general mechanics and electricity. These changes cannot be
implemented until after the first graduates of the technical teacher
training program of the Polytechnic become available in 1985.
6.15      In all the schools the home economics program comprising
housecraft, cooking and needlework has been successfully implemented. The
shortage of qualified teachers is a continuing problem with the result that
classes are not split into subgroups for the three activities of the
program. There is overcrowding in the needlecraft room, the cooking
facilities are underutilized in some schools and the theoretical approach
to instruction in nutrition, food preservation and other aspects of the
cooking program could have as well been done in a standard classroom. The
home economics equipment is adequate but in a number of instances sewing
machines are unserviceable, having gone out of adjustment, or stopped for
lack of oil.  The servicing of sewing machines needs to be included in the
training of home economics teachers. Although the needlecraft classes are
adequately supplied with material, there is a shortage or absence of
reference materials and books.
6.16       Implementation of the commercial program at two schools has been
only a qualified success. The agreed educational working papers did not to
provide separate typing rooms so that the machines would not need to be
removed from the desk-top, and the rooms should be provided with security
bars. Moreover, the commercial desks were designed as multi-purpose units
so that the machines could be stored underneath a shelf, with the result
that they served neither purpose well, ,being too high for typing and too
low for general subjects. The shifting of typewriters from place to place
inevitably results in loss of adjustment and more serious mechanical
damage. Finally, the problem was aggravated by a procurement 18" carriages
instead of 12" type of carriages.  Separate, secure typing rooms should be
provided at the first opportunity.
6.17       The extension of seven secondary schools enables the enrollment
of additional boarding students in a much improved learning environment.
Improved science facilities and the introduction of home science and
industrial arts and commercial subjects are significant improvements.
However, the teaching of commercial subjects as well as technical subjects
in general secondary schools is not being expanded in future new schools.
Secondary schools constructed under the Fourth Education Project (Credit
No. 1123-MAI) are not expected to offer these subjects. Teaching of
technical and commercial subjects will in future be confined to technical
secondary schools which are better suited to offer vocational and technical
training.
Economic Impact
6.18       The economic impact of this project cannot be evaluated with any
degree of precision since there was no provision to build the institution
necessary to collect the data required for the analysis. No tracer surveys
from the project schools by themselves exist. With regard to the primary



- 28 -
from the project schools by themselves exist.  With regard to the primary
schools, many of the project schools with the exception of those built on
existing school sites are preparing to produce their first batch of school
leavers. In any case, primary education is not intended to prepare the
recipients for the labor market. The situation is slightly different for
post primary and adult education since expansion of enrollment in post
primary and adult education institutions in Malawi, as in other Eastern
African countries, is invariably justified by its contribution to the
alleviation of shortages of trained and trainable manpower. This project
was no exception. The appraisal report estimated that the AECs would each
equip 1,000 adults annually with rural skills such as farm implement
repair, lhome economics, basic health skills and other such skills. This
did not materialize due to lack of commitment on the part of the MEC and
other Government agencies responsible for the coordination of adult
education.
6.19      With regard to the secondary school graduates, although funds
were made available for a tracer survey, the results of the survey of 1976
secondary school leavers conducted in 1978 have yet to be analysed by the
Government. However an analysis of this survey carried out by Bank Group
Staff 16/indicates almost full employment for those members of the cohort
not in full time education (0.17% unemployment rate). Furthermore, the
economic and social rate of return on secondary education in Malawi was
found to be in the range between 14 % and 21 % depending on the assumed
rate of unemployment. The private rate of return was approximately double
that of the social rate of return. The 1979 Manpower Survey results
indicate that the school system was still far short of producing the
requisite number of secondary school leavers which would meet the demand
for such persons both of the labor market and of tertiary level training
institutionsl7/. In view of these results, we can conclude that the
expansion of the secondary schools in this project has had a favorable and
substantial impact on the economy.
