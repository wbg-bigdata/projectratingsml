PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FOURTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1470-PAN)
1.       Loan 1470-PAN (USS73.3 million) 1 helped to finance the
construction of the 300 MM Fortuna Hydroelectric Power Plant, 41 kme of a
230 kV double circuit transmissinn line, expansion of the Panama Substation
and IRHE's organizational improvement program and training. The Project
was successful in meeting the objectives of: a) increasing the supply of
electricity to meet the country's needs, b) reducing Panama's heavy
dependence on imported fuel by decreasing fuel-fired thermal generation,
and c) implementing a large part of IRHE's organizational improvement
program.
2.       The Project was completed by the end of 1984, approximately one
and : half years later than the target completion date.  The main cause of
the delay was the adverse geological conditions encountered, which made
necessary a change of design for the powerhouse, reinforcement of the
tunnels and radical changes in the method of construction. The technical
solutions found for the problems were adequate and the Project is operating
satisfactorily.
3.       The financial performance of IRBE during the period of Project
construction was adequate, even though the institution experienced
financial difficulties due to lower electricity sales than expected at
appraisal, significant cost overruns and delay in the construct'--< of the
Project. IRHE's financial performance deteriorated significantly in recent
years due to rising operating costs, high level of accounts receivable and
system losses, and overstaffing.

INSTITUTO DE RECURSOS HIDRAULICOS Y ELECTRICOS
FOURTH POVER PROJECT (LOAN 1470-PAN)
I. BACKGROUND
1.1      Bank Participation in the Power Sector
1.1.1    Since 1962 the Bank made seven loans to IRHE totalling US$255.4
million (Annex 1.1). The first four .oans helped to finance hydroelectric
and thermal expansion (533 HW) and associated transmission.  The Fourth
loan, which is the subject of this report, helped to finance the
construction of the first stage of the Fortuna Hydroelectric Power Plant.
Bank participation sought to improve sector organization and planning and
foster tariff policies aimed at maintaining electricity prices in line with
long-run marginal costs, and at generating funds to finance the sector
investment requirements. It also facilitated the inflow of foreign
commercial and bilateral financing to the sector.
1.1.2.   As detailed in the corresponding Project Completion and Audit
Reports, the first three power projects financed under Loans 322-PAN
(1962), 661-PAN (1970) and 949-PAN (1973) were successfully completed,
although with some delays and cost overruns- The Fifth Power Project, Loan
1778-PAN (1979), was completed with a delay of three months and a cost
overrun of about 55Z.
1.1.3    The Sixth loan is helping to finance the continuation of the
rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution system, and the Seventh
loan is helping IRHE to finance raising the height of the Fortuna Dam,
which would increase Fortunais average generating capacity by about 247 GWh
per year. This loan will also help to finance the preparation of two
feasibil'y studies for new hydroelectric projects and an asset revaluation
study. The implementation of the Sixth and Seventh Projects has progressed
very slowly and has come to a standstill since November 1987 when loan
disbursements to Panama were suspended due to failure to service the debt
to the Bank.
1.2      Power Sector Organization and Regulation
1.2.1    IRHE, an autonomous Government agency created in 1961, is solely
responsible for public service electricity supply in Panama, except for the
supply to the Canal and adjacent areas, which have their own generating
plants and are interconnected to the IRHE system. IRHE acquired the
Compania Panamena de Fuerza y Luz (FyL) in 1972, the Empresas Electricas de
Chiriqui in 1973, the Hidroelectrica de El Valle in 1976, and two small
power utilities in 1978: La Chorrera, formerly a privately owned company in
West Panama 1rovince (about 3 HW), and Bocas del Toro, a municipal company
(less than 1 hW).
1.2.2    IRHE's Board of Directors is in charge of power sector policies.
There is no separate regulato&y body for the sector. Electricity tariffs
have to be approved by the Cabinet, on the basis of a recommendation by



-                                       U~~~~~~~~~~~
IRHE's Board and by the Economic Cabinet.1 IRHE's annual budget is subject
to approval by the Economic Cabinet.
1.2.3    IRHE and the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) signed
inarly in 1982 a system interconnection agreement setting forth the basis
for energy exchanges and pricing, and for the programing and financing of
the interconnection facilities. The facilities for the interconnection
were financed by the Bans under Loan 1778-PAN and by the Interamerican
Develorynent Bank 'IDB); the interconnection benefits both countries,
permitting the exchange of up to 150 MW of emergency power and the use of
secondary hydroelectric energy available in Costa Rica to replace thermal
generation in Panama. The interconnection facilities were commissioned in
March 1986 and are operating eatisfactorily.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1      Origin and Rationale for the Proiect
2.1.1    The Fourth Power Project had its origin in discussions held in
January 1972, as a result of the dialogue between IRHE and the Bank staff
during the supervision of ongoing power projects. The main objectives of
the project then outlined were to: a) provide energy to meet the
increasing demanud of electricity from 1983 onward by utilizing
hydroelectric energy available in the province of Chiriqui, allowing IRHE
to substitute large part of its thermal generation, 'us contributing to a
reduction in Panama's petroleum imports; b) improve the reliability of the
electric system with increased generation and transmission capacity in
order to support the National Development Plan, and c) assist IRHE to
improve its organization, planning, financing, staff development and
operation.
2.1.2    In addition, the proposed project would provide the Bank with an
opportunity to continue the monitoring cf IRHE's e^ficiency through key
indicators such as the number of employees, energy losses, tariffs, rate of
return and level of accounts payable and receivable.
2.2      Project Preparation and Appraisal
2.2.1    Project preparation took place in the period 1974-1976, during
which the Bank carried out four missions. The delay in preparation of the
project was due to IRHE's insufficient in-house capability, and the time
1/  The Economic Cabinet (Gabinete Economico) created by executive Decree
of November 25, 1983 is chaired by the Minister of the Presidency of
the Republic, and includes the Minister of Planning and Economic
Policy, the Minister of Finance and Treasury, the Minister of Commerce
and Industry, the Controller General of the Republic, the General
Manager of the National Bank of Panama and the General Manager of the
Caja de Ahorros (Government savings bank).



consumed in engaging external consultants to do the bulk of the engineering
and investment planning. Preparation time was also extended because of the
Bank conditionality related to IRHE's organizational, technical and
financial improvements; more specifically, the Bank made the appraisal of
the project contingent on agreement on electricity rates, settlement of
arrears of government-owned agencies, prompt payment to suppliers and
contractors, commitments on Government contributions to IRHE to cover cash
deficits and improvements in IREE's organization. Bank requirements
resulted in: a) an increase in Gc'ernment contributions to IRHE and
committment to approve rate increases; b) enactment of legislation making
IRHE fully responsible for the power sector and allowing IRHE to transfer
to other entities activities related to telephone and gas; c) reduction in
arrears to contractors and in the arrears of electricity bills by
government-owned agencies, and d) contracts with consultants to execute
studies on IRHE's organization and asset revaluation.
2.2.2    Because of slow progress in project preparation and on the actions
discussed above, it was necessary for the Bank to postpone, on various
occasions, its appraisal departure. Toward the middle of 1976, this
situation had created some friction between the Bank, IRHE's administration
and Government officials. During a visit to Washington in August 1976 by a
Panamanian mission, an agreement was reached on required information and on
a timetable for the pending actions, allowing appraisal in October 1976.
2.2.3    As a consequence of the delays in appraisal, project
commissioning was delayed about two years. Because of this, the Government
decided to build the La Estrella a,.d Los Valles Hydroelectric Projects,
which were originally scheduled to enter into operation after the La
Fortuna Project.
2.2.4    The project was appraised in October 1976.  The mission found no
major unresolved issues and recommended that a loan amounting to US$42
million be processed. It was agreed that before negotiations the
Government and IRER would: a) present to the Bank a diagnostic study of
IRHEE's reorganization, terms of reference for the training and
reJrganization studies; b) increase rates, effective January 1, 1977,
through the application of the new tariff structure agreed with the Bank,
plus 12 monthly rate increases starting February 1, 1977; c) send to the
Bank the legislation which authorized the above increases and allowed IRHE
to increase rates to earn a rate of return on revalued assets of 82 in 1978
and 8.75X thereafter; d) present to the Bank evidence that the asset
revaluation had been recorded on IRHE's books, and that IRHE's shott-term
debt outstanding had been cancelled; and e) send to the Bank the final
report of the ecology study for La Fortuna Project and a copy of the
contract in force to supply electricity to the Panama Canal Company. All
these conditions were fulfilled before negotiations.
2.2.5    The Fourth Power Project consisted of the following components:
i)   La Fortuna Hydroelectric Power Plant with a capacity of 300
MW, comprising:



- 4 -
(a)  a concrete faced, rockfill dam with a volume of 450,000
m3, 60 meters high, 240 meters crest length, elevation
1010 m above sea level, and ungated spillway, with a
storage capacity of 13 million cubic meters; this was
known as the Fortuna Dam First Stage;
(b)  a power tunnel, 6 km long, a surge tank and a penstock
1,400 m long;
(c)  a tailrace tunnel, 8.3 km long; and
(d)  access roads, camp and auxiliary works.
(ii)   La Fortuna Transmission System, consisting of:
(a)  a 230 kV switchyard at Fortuna;
(b)  the 41 km of 230 kV double circuit transmission line
Fortuna-David; and
(c)  expansion of the Panama Substation with one 175 MVA
230/115 kV transformer and switchgear.
(iii)   IRHE's organizational improvement program and training.
2.2.6    The appraisal mission estimated the cost of the project at
US$253.6 million (including interest during construction of US$31.4
million), with foreign and local costs estimated at US$72.3 and US$181.3
million, respectively. The project was estimated to be financed as
follows:
Million US$
IBRD                                     42.0
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)  98.0
Suppliers' Credits                       21.6
IRHE and Government                      92.0
253.6
IBRD would finance the foreign currency requirements for the diversion
works, rockfill dam, the ancillary electromechanical equipment for the
powerhouse and the transmission system, the organizational improvement
program and training and the associated engineering services. IDB would
finance the foreign requirements of the power tunnel, surge tank and
penstock, underground powerhouse (excluding equipment), tailrace tunnel,
associated engineering services and interest during construction on the IDB
loan. The suppliers' credits would finance 90Z of the main generating
equipment and power transformers for the powerhouse.
2.3      Negotiations, Board Presentation and Effectiveness
2.3.1    Negotiations were held May 16-20, 1977, without major problems,
and the Board approved the Loan on June 28, 1977. Representatives of the
Bank, IRHE and the Government signed the Loan and Guarantee Agreements on



- 5 -
July 1, 1977. The Loan amounted to US$ 42.0 million; the term was 17
years, including 3.5 years of grace; the interest rate was 8.2X. May 30,
1983 was set as project completion date and December 31, 1983 as the Loan
Closing Date.
2.3.2    The Bank declared the loan effective on February 8, 1978, four
months later than originally forecast because two of the conditions of
effectiveness, payment of overdue electricity bills by the Government and
cofinancing arrangements for the project, were delayed. The reasons for
the delay were: (i) financial difficulties on the Government's side, which
resulted in a longer time than anticipated in settling overdue electricity
bills, and (ii) the processing of the US$98 million loan from IDB, was
delayed because it included cofinancing with commercial banks (US$28
million), which was placed in the market later than expected. The reason
was that Panama had recently borrowed on the Eurodollar market and IDB and
the Government considered advisable to postpone for a few months the
additional borrowings for the project.
2.4      Major Covenants of the Loan Agreement
2.4.1    Annex 2.1 includes the main covenants of the Loan and Guarantee
Agreements. The Panamanian Government and IRHE complied with their
respective major covenants, except as regarded the rate of return and
arrears in accounts receivable, as explained in detail in Chapter 5.
III. PROJECT EXECUTION AND COST
3.1      Timetable and Changes in the Project
3.1.1    Implementation of the Project started in December 1977 and ended
in November 1984, or 17 months later than the original completion date.
Annex 3.1 shows the detailed works components and a comparison between the
actual and forecast completion dates. All the facilities have been working
satisfactorily since completion.
3.1.2    The main reason for late project completion was the delay in civil
works caused by the measures taken to cope with the problem created by the
adverse geological conditions encountered. The original design of the
project was based on detailed geological studies and test drilling programs
carried out by IRHE with the assistance of consultants, which predicted
geological formations, faults, quantity and quality of rock and soil,
construction methods, etc. Once construction started, however, conditions
found in the cavern for the power house and inclined penstock area were
worse than predicted, specially because the amount of tuff was higher and
the tuff pockets more frequent than predicted. To solve the problem,
important changes of design to the powerhouse were made, tunnels had to be
reinforced and radical changes were introduced to the method of
construction; conditions found in the foundations for the right abutment of
the dam and spillway also were worse than expected. As a result, the
construction program was delayed 18 months. The extent of the geological
studies and test drilling performed by IRHE prior to the Bank appraisal for
the project were at that time considered adequate by the Bank and by IRHE's
independent Board of Consultants, in accordance with international



- 6 -
engineering practices. However, in the last 10 years there has been a
pattern of geological difficulties in what appears to be a problem related
to the geographical area bordering in the north by Guatemala and in the
south by Ecuador. In retrospect it now seems clear that more detailed
geological investigations are required for hydroelectric projects located
in this area, that involve complex civil works such as dams, long tunnels
and deep powerhouse caverns; in addition, the Bank should engage the
services of specialists in geology and geomechanics to perform an
independent review of the geologicAl studies prepared by the Borrower.
3.1.3    At the beginning of project implementation there were procurement
problems because IRHE, due to cumbersome internal procedures, failed to
observe the Bank's guidelines and did not make the changes to the bidding
documents recommended by the Bank. In order to improve the flow of
information within the utility, IRHE requested that all correspondence be
in Spanish. The Bank complied with IRHE's request for a while, but due to
the changes in staff handling the project, the request was only partially
fulfilled in subsequent years.
3.1.4    An important point to discuss is the implications of building the
Fortuna Dam in two stages: First Stage (elevation 1010 m) and Second Stage
(elevation 1050 m).  Although IRHE and the Bank agreed during appraisal
that the Second Stage would be completed after several years, as early as
at the time of preparation of bidding documents for the First Stage, IRHE
requested authorization from the Bank to ask from bidders, in addition to
the basic bid (Fortuna Dam First Stage), an alternative to build the dam to
its final elevation. The reasons given by I'HE were based on economic
considerations: as the price of oil was on the rise, the added storage
capacity of the higher dam would save substantial amounts of fuel from
thermal generation; in addition, the cost of the dam would be reduced as
tenders would be more responsive and less expensive because of the economy
of scale. In order to consider IRHE's proposal, the Bank requested
additional economic and financial studies to demonstrate the justification
of this change.  An independent consultant prepared the economic analysis
which concluded that both construction alternatives would be equivalent.
There is voluminous correspondence on this subject; IRHE continually
complained about slow Bank procedures and response. Even after the
contract for the dam First Stage was awarded, IRHE insisted on changing the
contract to incorporate the Fortuna Second Stage. However, the Governme'nt
hesitated and did not fully support IRHE's decision; the Bank did not agree
and construction proceeded. During the execution of the project the Bank
accepted to consider another loan for construction of the Second Stage (the
Seventh Power Project, Loan 2506-PAN). In retrospect, considering all the
problems and delays that IRHE experienced in starting the construction of
the Second Stage of the dam, it seems that building the project to its
higher elevation would have been the best solution. It would have saved
valuable time as well as the cost of mobilizing a new contractor, and would
have avoided extra procedures and cost of a new bid; but especially, it
would have advanced the increase of storage capacity which would have been
extremely beneficial for the operation of IRHE's power system during dry
years -- such as those experienced by IRHE in the period 1985-1988 -- and
would have avoided power shortages and saved fuel from thermal generation.
3.1.5    As a result of IFYE's decision to initiate the Second Stage and
with the purpose of optimizing the use of resources, some modifications



- 7 -
were introduced to the original design of Stage 1, including an increase in
the amount of excavation for the foundation of the dam, changes in the
height of the right abutment of the spillway, the development of part of
the quarry for the Second Stage, and elimination of the bridge over the
spillway canal. In addition, as the works related to the Second Stage
would take some time, IRHE decided to increase the spillway capacity by
constructing a parapet of 2.25 m over the dam to be able to handle a
maximum flood of 5300 m3/sec. This was an important recommendation made by
the Board of Consultants with the understanding that even with this
additional capacity, the First Stage of the dam would not offer a
completely safe spillway operation and that the risk of the dam overtopping
and/or dam destruction existed with a probability of one in 100 years.
3.1.6    Poor geological conditions (para. 3.1.2) were the reason for the
following design changes: a) reduction in the size of the powerhouse and
strengthening the supporting system of the walls of the underground cavern;
b) heavy reinforcement of the walls of the 433 m vertical cable shaft
joining the powerhouse with the substation, which caved in during
construction; c) increasing the reinforcement of the pressure, access and
discharge tunnels; and d) changes in the design of the right abutment of
the spillway and dam.
3.1.7    fo tackle the serious problems faced during project construction
and, due to the failure of the main consultant to appoint, in the
beginning, the highly qualified staff required under the circumstances,
IRHE increased its reliance on the Board of Consultants. The Board met
frequently to monitor the project construction, to discuss technical
solutions proposed by IRHE, the consultant and the contractors, and to
recommend new technical approaches to various problems. The Bank staff who
supervised the project agreed that the technical solutions recommended by
the Board were satisfactory. However, the Bank found IRHE slow in
implementing recommerded measures originally envisaged to strengthen
project management and improve decision-making at the project site. After
discussions with the Bank, IRHE appointed a new Project Director, resident
at the project site, and the Technical Director (residing at IRHE's
headquarters) was given more resources, authority and responsibility to
enable him to comply with the construction schedvle; in addition, a high
level Claims Negotiating Commission was appointed to promptly settling the
claims of the contractors.
3.2      Studies
3.2.1    The project originally included a program of organizational
improvements and training to be implemented with the help of a consultant.
IRHE hired a foreign consultant to undertake this task and, as a
consequence of the studies, it made changes in its organization, issued a
manual of administrative procedures, job descriptions, ---counting manual,
etc. The consultanL also assisted in the training of 209 officials in the
areas of business administration, project costs and control, project
administration and efficiency indicators.
3.2.2    It is unclear whether the objectives originally pursued by the
Bank were achieved, as the record suggests that the Bank staff which
supervised the project paid limited attention to following up on the
implementat.on of the 3tudies.



3.2.3    The Loan Agreement required IRHE to carry out, with the assistance
of consultants acceptable to the Bank, a tariff study based on marginal
cost principles. The study was undertaken by a consultant. Based on the
recommendations of this study, IRHE introduced satisfactory changes in the
structure as well as in the level of tariffs.
3.3      Project Costs
3.3.1    Annex 3.2 shows appraisal and actual costs.  Including all
charges, the final project cost was about US$522.1 million2 (in current
prices) as compared with the appraisal forecast of US$253.59 million, or
1062 of cost overrun, which is attributed mainly to:
(a) advance construction of some works of Fortuna Dam Second
Stage (para. 3.1.5; (approximately 42 of the cost overrun);
(b) changes in the design of the powerhouse and tunnels due to
poor 6eological conditions (para. 3.1.6); (approximately
682);
(c) higher administration and engineering costs, due to longer
construction period than originally estimated; (approximately
102);
(d) higher financial charges caused by construction delays and
tougher financial conditions of some short-term loans granted
to IRHE by commercial banks (approximately 182);
3.3.2    The cost overrun could not be financed by IRHE with internally
generated funds, as electricity rates could not be raised further from the
high levels already set in 1983; the '-overnnment could not raise additional
funds either, as the world economic recession that began in 1982 affected
the Panamanian economy and caused financial constraints that lasted for
several years. Under these conditions, and considering that the cost
overun was not caused by mismanagement but rather by substantive changes in
the conditions foreseen at appraisal, the Bank' accepted IRHE's application
for a supplementary loan of US$31.3 million. The complementary loan was
approved by the Board on March 29, 1983, signed on May 3, 1983, and
declared effective on June 29, 1983. IRHE also obtained additional
financing from IDB, commercial banks, contractors and suppliers. The
details of actual sources of financing of the Project are presented below:
2/ Project costs are not fully comparable, as final costs include some
preparatory work for the Second Stage (about 22 of the final cost)

3.3.3    The bulk of the financing for the additional costs came from
suppliers' credits and commercial banks, as IRHE was not able to raise
additional funds (Section V) and the Government faced severe financial
problems due mainly to the ever increasing service of public debt.
3.4      Changes in Closing Date, Allocation of Loan Proceeds and Timing of
Disbursements
3.4.1    The closing date was postponed to April 30, 1986, and, upon the
request of IRHE, the Bank agreed that the final disbursement date would be
October 30, 1986, in order to allow time to settle the pending claims
related to civil works for the construction of the dam. The last
disbursement occurred on October 31, 1986. Annexes 3.3 and 3.4 compare
actual and forecast data disbursements and allocation of loan proceeds by
categories.
3.5      Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.5.1    IRHE carried out the project engineering design, construction and
supervision with the assistance of a foreign consulting firm. In addition,
a Board of Consultants periodically revlewed the project construction and
advised IRHE on technical problems (para. 3.1.7). The Bank staff in charge
of supervising the project attended only two of the 24 meetings of that
Board. In retrospect, it seems that the Bank would have been well advised
to allocate additional time for Bank staff to attend some of the Board of
Consultants' meetings where complex engineering matters related to a unique
project in the Region were presented. During the execution of the work,
IRHE Lo!lained on the performance of some staff of the consultant, who
were replaced quickly; overall, IRHE was satisfied with the performance of
the consultant, specially on the transfer of technology and training of
IRHE's staff. The performance of the Board of Consultants was
satisfactory.



- 10 -
3.5.2    The principal contractors were an Italian firm for the powerhouse
and tunnels and a Japanese firm for the dam and spillway. IRHE and the
Bank were generally satisfied with both firms. Due to problems faced by
the project (para. 3.1.2), IRHE pressed the Italian firm to appoint to the
project site more experienced staff, and the firm agreed to this request
with some delay. IRHE was satisfied with the works of the contractor and
technical suggestions made for solving unforeseen situations. However,
IRHE was not always happy with the claims presented by both contractors
because the claims, according to IRHE, were excessive and not well
documented, causing settlement to be a long and stressful process.
3.5.3    The performance of the suppliers was generally satisfactory.  The
delays were minor and did not affect commissioning of the project.
However, it is noteworthy that there were some problems with a cooling
pump, a battery charger and a step-up power transformer. The latter forced
IRHE to take generating Unit No. 2 out of service after three months of
operation; the transformer was returned to the manufacturer for repair, and
this was done to IRHE's satisfaction. As the outage of Unit No. 2 occurred
during the dry season of 1984185 when, due to water limitations, the power
plant could not operate at full capacity, its impact on IRHE's system and
finances was minor.
IV - PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
4.1      Need to Supply Power Facilities
4.1.1    The main objective of the project was to provide IRHE with
gqnerating and transmission facilities to supply electricity for the
country's needs through the interconnected system beginning in mid-1983.
The project would utilize hydroelectric energy available in the province of
Chiriqui, allowing IRHE to substitute a large part of its thermal
generation, contributing in this way to a reduction in petroleum imports.
An additional objective of the project was to assist IRHE in improving its
organization, planning, financing, staff development and operation.
4.1.2    The project was successful in meeting its main objectives byt a)
allowing an adequate supply of electricity; b) reducing the heavy
dependence on imported fuel by reducing thermal generation from 90Z in 1976
to 33Z in 1986; and c) implementing a large part of the organizational
improvement and training program envisaged at appraisal. It was not
successful, however, in achieving a lasting improvement of IRHE's finances.
4.2      Rate of Return on Investment
4.2.1    The appraisal estimated the rate of return at 17.7Z; the cost
stream included the investments on the power plant and the associated
transmission and distribution facilities. On the benefits side, all the
incremental sales plus part of the fuel saved from thermal generation
substituted were attributed to the project. Following the same methodology
but with actual data for the period 1977-86 and including the capital costs
and the energy sales attributed to other projects constructed during the
same period (para. 2.2.3), the rate of return has been estimated at about
12X (Annex 4.1), which is still adequate as compared to the cost of capital
estimated at 112.



- 11 -
4.2.2    The reason why the new estimate of the rate of return is still
satisfactory, even though the costs of the Project increased substantially.
is because electricity rates also increased significantly during the period
subject to analysis 3 and these rates have been used to value the benefits.
It is also important to note that the costs of the Project used to estimate
the rate of return (Annex 4.1) are expressed in constant prices of mid-
1977; therefore, inflation, one of the elements of cost overrun, is
eliminated. The cost stream for the economic analysis also excludes
financial charges as is customary. Deducting inflation and financial
charges, the total Project cost in mid-1977 prices amounted to B/250.6
million, 662 higher than the B/150.7 million forecast at appraisal.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1      Comparison of Actual and Forecast Data
5.1.1    ALaexes 5.1 to 5.4 compare the actual and appraisal forecast
income statements, sources and applications of funds and balance sheets for
the period 1976-86. IRHE's financial performance during the period of
project execution (1976-83) was adequate, even though IRHE experienced
financial difficulties due to lower electricity sales than expected at
appraisal4 and the cost overrun and delays in the Fortuna Project. IRHE's
financial performance deteriorated significantly in recent years due to
failure of electricity rates to keep pace with costs, high level of
accounts receivable and overstaffing. The financial indicators presented
in Annex 5.4 show that the rates of return covenanted were met in the
period 1977-81, but not met in the subsequent years, declining
significantly comparpd to the above-mentioned period, reaching 6.6? in
1986. By 1987 the situation had deteriorated to the point where the Bank
refused to extend the closing date on Loan 2313-PAN until a satisfactory
financial rehabilitation plan was received (para. 5.5.1). Disbursements on
all loans to Panama have been suspended since November 30, 1987, due to
failure to pay debt service.
5.2      Electricity Rates and Operating Expenses
5.2.1    Average rates, in current prices, increased from US 5.6 centslkWh
in 1976 to US 12.6 cents/kWh in 1984. In mid-1978 prices, this represents
an average annual increase of about 4.7Z. Operating expenses grew at
approximately the same pace as rates, higher than envisioned at appraisal
due to high fuel expenses caused by project delay and dry seasons that
31 The electricity rate used to update the estimation of the rate of
return for 1986 and thereafter is the rate of 1986, expressed in mid-
1977 prices, or B/0.0787. This rate is 57? higher than the one used in
the appraisal estimate.
rd
4/ In the period 1976-83 actual electricity sales were 19? lower than
forecast at appraisal.



- 12 -
caused higher thermal generation, and overstaffing. Due to lower sales and
higher operating expenses, IRHE was unable to meet the covenanted rate of
return of 8.752 in the period 1982-84 of project construction. The returns
for these years were 7.7Z, 5.7? and 7.5?. Further deterioration in the
rate of return occurred in 1985 and 1986, 6.3Z and 6.6Z respectively.
During project construction the Bank waived this requirement because of the
generally satisfactory financial performance in this period, but as the
deterioration in the financial conditions deepened from 1985 onward, the
Bank pressed IRHE and the Government to implement an action program to
solve this situation (para. 5.5.1).
5.3      Accounts Receivable
5.3.1    The level of accounts receivable increased from 85 days in 1976 to
118 days in 1986, compared to the 60 days level covenanted under Section
5.06 of the Loan Agreement. The level of accounts receivable is higher for
municipalities, government departments and autonomous agencies,
representing about 300 days in 1986. This situation, in turn, was one of
the contributing factors for increasing the level of short-term borrowings,
from US$ 13.3 million in 1976 to US$ 42.4 million in 1984 and to US$ 59.1
million in 1986, figures that are well above the covenanted one-sixth of
the cash operation and maintenance expenses. The Bank requested IRHE to
reduce the level of accounts receivable to the agreed level, but IRHE was
not able to follow strict collection policies such as the curtailment of
service because, based on political grounds, the Government discouraged
tough measures. Furtherraore, even though thu Government agreed to
establish a mechanism to deal with the arrears of the public sector, these
measures were not implemented due to the strained finances of that sector.
5.4      Energy Losses and Number of Employees
5.4.1    Two other factors negatively affected IRHE's finances: the
increase in the level of energy losses and the increase in the number of
employees.  Energy losses increased from 15.1X in 1976 to 16&  in 1984 and
19.7? in 1986, which is above the 12.2? agreed in the efficiency monitoring
indicators; a large part of the losses are due to technical reasons
(insufficicat transmission and distribution facilities) and the rest are
due to theft and fraud.  Technical losses are expected to be reduced
through the improvement of the transmission and distribution system under
the Sixth Power Project.  Regarding non-technical losses, IRHE has proposed               -
to the Government to enact legislation against fraud. IRHE is also
undertaking a specific program to deal with this problem which is financed
by IDB. The number of employees is another issue affecting IRHE's
finances. The average number of permanent personnel grew from 3,528 in
1976 to 5,334 in 1983, which is about 25? higher than the target
established in the agreed efficiency monitoring indicators. The increase
went further, to 5,643 in 1986. In 1986, the ratios of customers and of
KWh sold to employees were 51 and 36.1, respectively, which are low
compared to similar power utilities in Latin America.
5.5      Financial Rehabilitation
5.5.1    As mentioned above, IRHE's financial performance has been steadily
deteriorating since 1984; efficiency and financial indicators presented in



- 13 -
Annex 5.4 show this deteriorating trend. The main causes of this situation
may be attributed to the frequent changes of executive and senior positions
of IRHE and political considerations in the choice of these appointments,
overstaffing and high employee benefits, frequent labor union disputes,
slow process of government approvals of public bids and contracts, non-
payment of electricity bills by public institutions, and slow action by
IRHE and the Government to adopt measures to decrease energy losses. In
the context of Loans 2313 and 2506-PAN, the Bank has been requesting IRHE
and the Government to adopt a Financial Rehabilitation Agreement (FRA),
which would define a viable plan to reestablish the sound technical and
financial status th-t IRHE once had. The FRA would establish annual
performance goals to include production costs, energy losses, control of
fraud, payment or compensation for public sector arrears, and streamlining
of purchase and contracts procedures. The agreement between IRHE and the
Government has not yet been reached. In the nmeantime, another pressing
issue has developed: because of arrears in payment of the Bank's loans,
disbursements of all Bank loans to Panama were suspended. The situation
has been further complicated as a result of the political turmoil which
developed in March 1988.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.1      IRHE
6.1.1    Though the project suffered from financial and technical problems
which delayed its commissioning by about 17 months, IRHE acted in a manner
satisfactory under the circumstances. To deal with the geological problems
found in the tunnels and underground powerhouse, IRHE increased its
reliance on the Board of Consultants, which proved to be an adequate
approach. IRHE acted well, although often slowly, in the implementation of
the recommendations of the Board; eventually IRHE had at the site of the
project an adequate number of qualified own staff, the project consultant,
and the contractors charged with the civil works. IRHE acted swiftly to
obtain the additional financing needed to bridge the gap created by the
cost overrun.
6.1.2    The financial performance and technical efficiency have
deteriorated in recent years, particularly from 1985 onward. IRHE seems to
be overwhelmed with the present situation; their actions to overcome the
problems are being taken slowly or are not being taken at all. Major
changes are needed to place the utility again on a sound footing.
6.2      The Government
6.2.1    Throughout project implementation, the Government acted
satisfactorily, except in recent years when accounts receivable of
government departments, municipalities and autonomous agencies have
increased, representing 300 days in 1986 as compared with 60 days
covenanted. The Government is also acting slowly in enacting legislation
aimed at counteracting energy losses due to fraud, and its involvement in
procurement matters generally results in very lengthy times until contracts
are awarded.



- 14 -
6.3      The Bank
6.3.1    The Bank's staff dedicated considerable time and energy toward the
project supervision and were generally flexible in responding to IRHE's
requests. However, the Bank seems to have been unduly rigid regarding
IRHE's requested inclusion of the Fortuna Dam Second Stage. The Bank also
failed to supea.:ise to the extent desirable IRHE's finances and the
organizational improvement program and training components. Financial
supervision missions were few during the first years of project
implementation.
VII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.1.1    In retrospect, it seems that the Fortuna Project should have been
built in one stage to its final elevation. It would have saved time as
well as construction costs and would have increased storage capacity and
saving of fuel. A more receptive attitude from the Bank might have served
to find a solution by assisting IRHE to take decisions on project
conception early in the implementation period.
7.1.2    For hydroelectric projects that involve complex civil works such
as dams, long tunnels and deep powerhouse caverns, specially in areas with
poor geological conditions, as a condition for project appraisal the Bank
should request that very detailed geological studies and a carefuly
designed drilling program be carried out, in order to minimize the
possibilities of cost overruns due to construction problems, change in
design, etc. The Bank should engage the services of specialists in geology
and geomechanics to perform an independent review of the studies prepared
by the Borrowers.
7.1.3    Even with the complexity of technical and financial problems faced
by the project, IRHE, under the circumstances, acted promptly by increasing
its reliance on the Board of Consultants (which performed an outstanding
job), by hiring a consultant to help IREE in handling the claims of
contractors, by demanding greater efficiency from the consultant and
contractors and by obtaining the financing to cover the gap created because
of cost overrun. All this helped to achieve the main objective of the
project, for which IRHE has to be credited.   However, toward the end of
the Project implementation period the organization and finances of IRHE
deteriorated, situation that has been accentuated in recent years. The
main cause of this may be attributed to frequent changes of executive and
senior positions of IRHE and political considerations in the choice of
these appointments, overstaffing, non-payment of electricity bills by
public institutions and a slow action by IRPE and the Government to adopt
measures to decrease energy losses. A lesson to be learned is that the
Dank should insist that Governments should support the running of public
institutions, in a business-like manner, without external interferences in
the organization and finances of the company.
