CREDIT S-20-EGT
PREFACE
This report reviews the preparation, implementation and achievements
of a water supplv engineering and technical assistance project for which
Development Credit S-20-EGT was made in December 1977 to the Arab Republic of
Egvpt for Uge 2,0OO,o0O, of which 1JS$ 4,313 was cancelled in September 1980.
The project was implemented by the General Organization for Potable Water
(r,oPW) of the Ministrv of H-ousing.
The report was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
ReRion Office on the basis of a review of the President's Report, the Credit
Agreement, sup6rvision Reports and other documents related to project
implementation.
Following standard OED procedures, copies of the PCR were sent
to the Borrower for comments; a copy of the telex received is attached
as an Appendix to the report.

PROJECT COb4LETION REPOR~T
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
CREDIT S-20-EGT
HIGELIGHTS
An April 1977 project identification mission had concluded that a
proiect could best be prepared through an engineering and technical assistance
proiect. A June l177 WHO/IBRD sector report had confirmed the Government's
views on the need for sector reforms.  This report facilitated project formu-
lation (para. 1.01).
The project was prepared expeditiouslv (para. 2.01).  It consisted of
t-chnical assistance in enRineering and manaRement services.  Its objectives
were:
(a) to identify and prepare a regional vater supply project;
(b)  to define suitable regional groupings and priorities for water supply
services in Provincial Ezvpt; and
(c)  to develop appropriate mantagement, orRanization and financial struc-
tures for GOPW.



- vii -
Neveloputent Credit S-20-EGT for USg 2.0 million was approved in Dec-
emher 1077 to finance the foreign exchange requirements of the project (para.
2.n2)                          I
The Credit became efFective as planned but recruitment of consultants
took loneer than expected due to loneer than foreseen time needed for
evaluation of proposals and neeotiati-on of contract with the consultant
selected. Mohilization was rapid and the studies were carried out
e,neditiouslv (para. 3.n1).  The studies were executed bv a U.K. consortium in                *
association with E2vptian consultants. This coupled with the direct and
dedicated involvement of GOPW's personnel and close IDA follow-up contributed
to the smooth execution and broad acceptance of the studies and their
recommendations (oara. 3.02).
Proiect obiectives were all met. In particular a Follow-on water
supuD1v oroiect has heen prevared and Development Credit 1156-EGT for USt 56.6
mitlion approved in June 1Q81 (para. 3.03.b).
Proiect costs amounted to Ugt 2.7 million as compared with appraisal
esti.mates of US$ 2.3 million.  The overrun which stemmed mostly from higher
bids than anticipated was financed hv the Government (para. 3.04).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
CREDIT S-20-EGT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.0l     The Government had been aware of the need to increase investment in
the water supplv sector and had allocated LE.5.5 billion (US$ 1.4 billion
ecu4valent) in its 1976-85 planning period.  Tn February 1977, the Bank had
approved Loan 1369-EGT for US$ 56.0 million, to help rehabilitate and expand
the water supplv infra- structure of Greater Alexandria.  Shortly before thicn,
in Januarv 1977, a mission had visited Egypt to identify a second water supply
project.  A follow up April 1977 mission had concluded, however, that the
extent of aL;sistance required to prepare the project and to address other
broad sector issues would be best provided through an engineering and
technical assistance project. In July 1q77, the conclusions and
recommendations of a June 1977 WHO/IBRD sector report were presented to the
Government. They were well received. In essence they confirmed and
reinforced the Government's views on the need for sector reform. This
facilitated the formulation and implementation of the project.



^2-
TI, PROJECT PRE?ARATION
2.01     Proiect preparation consisted of defining che scone of work to be
carried out bv COPW and its consultants and in preparing the terms of refer-
ence for the studies to he carried out. This work was carried out e,xpediti-
ouslv l'v (.nPW with the assistance of TDA and -as completed during appraisal in
September 1977.  The proiect consisted of technical assistance in engineering
and manazement services havine three inter-related components with the follow-
ine obiectives:
(a)  identify and prepare a regional water supply project;
(b)  define suitable reeional groupings and priorities for water supply
services in the territorv served by COPW 1/; and
(c)  develop appropriate rnanaRement, organization and financial structures
for ,OPW.
2.02     Development Credit S-20-EGT for US$ 2.0 million was negotiated in
E"vnt in October 10i7 and approved in December 1977.  tt was intended to
finance the entire foreian exchange requirements of the proiect the total cost
of which was estimated at US.t 2.3 million.
I/ GOPW's territorv used to cover the so-called Provincial Egypt which
consists of the whole country excluding the six major cities of Cairo,
Alexandria, Relwan, Ismailia, Port Said and Suez.

1II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Xmplementation
3.01     The Credit became effective a few dxys before the date originally set
for this purpose, on April 28, 1978. The recruitment of consultants, however,
took about three and one half months longer than anticipated mainlv because of
the additional time spent on the evaluation of the five proposals received and
in negotiating a contract with the selected consultant. The consultant mobil-
ized rapidlv and implementation of the studies was carried ouit expeditiously.
The ce.'.,ultants' final report was presented with a delay of about two months
in Februarv 1980, i.e. about 15 months after commencement of the studv.  This
delav occurred mostlv during the review period of the interim report. Trans-
lation of the final reports into Arabic required another four months which had
not been foreseen at appraisal.  The project was thus completed in June 1980.
1.02     A U.I<, consortium in association with Cgyptian consultants carried
out the studiep. This association coupled with the direct and dedicated
involvement of GOPW's staff contributed to the smooth execution of the studies
and the broad acceptance of the final report. Also important to the success
of the project was the close follow-up provided through three full supervision
missions and several short visits in conjunction with other missions.
Outcome of the Studies
3.03     The objectives of the project were achieved.  The findings and
recommendations of the studies have made a substantial contribution to the
current and potential development of Egypt's provincial water supply sector.
Final reports covered, inter alia:
(a)  the investments required to provide access to a safe and reliable
basic supplv for the existing and projected population of Provincial
lEvpt %/.  The studies set out priorities within the provincial
sector as well as investment levels which constituted important
shifts and increases in the existing investment programs. The cost
of these irvestments was estimated by the studies at LE 500 million
in 197T prices for the period 1980-1990, and LE 1,200 million for the
period 1990-2000. The priorities and levels recommended have been
largelv adopted by the relevant agencies and incorporated in the
latest Five Year Plan;
1/ See note 1, Page 2



(b)  detailed developyment programs for water supplv in the Beheira and
Vafr El Sheikh governorates up to the vear 2000 and feasibilitv
studies for proiects, suitable for international financing, desiened
to meet the demand for water up to 1990. These feasibilitv studies
;ormed the hasis for (i) t.he Beheira Provincial Potable Water Supplv
Proiect for which Credit 1196-EGT of US$ 56.6 million was approved in
November 1QSl, and (,i) a similar project in th-.e Kafr El Sheikh
governorate which is to he vartlv financed hv Vreditanstalt fuer
Wiederaufbau; and
(c)  recommendations for the recrzani2ation and decentralization of the
sector. Av presidential Decre3 No. 107 of ADril 7, 10l, the Nation-
al Organization for Potable Water and Sanitarv Drainaae (NC?WASD) was
created to replace GOPWA7, heretoFore resoonsible L-or wat-r sapni, ani
she General Organization for Sanitation and Sanitarv Drainaze.
NOPWASn was given responsibilitv to formulate policies and plans at
the national level and to provide Ruidance to the governorates which
at the same time became responsible for the planning, implementation
and operation of potable water supplies and sewerage svstems within
their territorv. The basic thrust of these institutional reforms,
which were an important departure from the existine situation, was
along the lines recommended bv the studies. Similarlv the
establishment of the Beheira Water Companv (BWC), and a similar
companv in Kafr El Sheikh, which was created just prior to
negotiations for Credit 1156-EGT in March 1981, for the production
and distribution of potable water within the Beheira Governorate
territory was a maior breakthrough.  BWC is expected to serve as a
model in setting up similar companies in other governorates.
Project Costs
3.04     rotal proiect costs amounted to US$ 2.7 million (appraisal US$ 2.3
million). The bulk of the increase or about USt 0.3 million stemmed from the
orieinal contract which was hiRher than anticipated. The remainder was due to
currencv fluctuations. The overrun was financed by the Government.
Credit Nishursements
1.0l,    The Credit was fullv disbursed except for US$ 4,312.65 which was
cancelled in September 19R0. Reflecting the slippage discussed in para. 3.01,
the last payment was made in mid-Julv 1980, i.e. 13 months later than origin-
allv foreseen.

IV, CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
4,nl     The obiectives of the project were fully met (para. 3.03).  This may
be attributed to (i) the timelv completion of the WHO/IBRD sector report which
facilitated the formulation and implementation of the project; (ii) the
association of local consultants with the foreign consultants which
contributed to the Smooth execution of the stuidies and the broad acceptance of
which the final report received: and (iii) the direct and dedicated
involvement of the local personnel (para. 3.02) as well as the close and
continuous supervision provided bv IDA missions (para. 3.02).
