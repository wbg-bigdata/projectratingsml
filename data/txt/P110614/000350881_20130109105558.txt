1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 The Sergipe State Integrated Project was the second operation of a planned two-phase
Rural Poverty Reduction Program (RPRP) supporting the State and approved by the Federal
Committee for External Financing (COFIEX) in 2000. In its approval, COFIEX, acting under
provisions of the then-new Fiscal Responsibility Law, divided the planned operation of US$41.6
million into two loans of US$20.8 million each, with performance conditions for moving to a
second phase. Due to fiscal non-compliance issues with the Federal Government, Sergipe could
not proceed with an Additional Financing and thus Phase 1 closed in June 2006.1 Notably, there
was a gap of three and one-half years between the Concept Note Review (March 2005) and Board
approval (September 2008) of Phase II and another 10 months to project effectiveness in July
2009. The Project’s effective execution period, including a six-month extension, was three years.

1.1.2 National context: By appraisal in 2008, a combination of sound macro-economic
policies and bold, innovative pro-poor investment programs had witnessed a sustained reduction
in poverty and inequality in Brazil. Strong macro-economic management had benefited the poor
by reducing inflation, promoting economic growth and trade liberalization, and creating jobs.
Targeted pro-poor initiatives included the Bolsa Familia cash transfer program, social security
transfers, investments in education at all levels, and large-scale Bank-supported rural community-
driven development and market-based land reform programs in the Northeast Region. The share
of Brazilians living in poverty fell from 36% to 28%, and consumption and income indicators
improved along with a range of non-income indicators of wellbeing.

1.1.3 These striking improvements did not eliminate the serious challenges still facing Brazil in
addressing poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion, especially in the Northeast Region and its
rural areas in particular. About 52% of the total poor in Brazil resided in the Northeast with most
in rural areas, small towns and villages where economic activity revolved around family
agriculture and associated services. While growth in the Northeast had surpassed national rates in
the previous decade the starting point for incomes and wellbeing was well below the national
average needing sustained investment and reform efforts to close the gap.

1.1.4 State of Sergipe: At appraisal, the State of Sergipe – the smallest State in Brazil - ranked
23rd nationally in its Human Development Index (HDI) with 54% of its population still classified
as poor. Rural poverty was especially severe with 50% of rural households depending on less
than one minimum salary per month (about US$280 at the time) and 61% on less than two.
While the State had recorded marked reductions in families lacking electricity and sanitation,
some 46% of households still lacked piped water, and jobs and income generation had become an
urgent focus of public interventions. The State performed well under Phase I, achieving project
objectives, reaching vulnerable populations, financing a large number of productive investments
and leveraging additional resources through participatory, cross-sector integration efforts.

1.1.5 Rationale for Bank involvement: The World Bank’s long-term partnership with the
Federal Government and with State Governments of the Northeast Region had seen the
community-driven development (CDD) projects under the Northeast Rural Poverty Reduction
Program (RPRP) benefit an estimated 11 million people since 1993, contribute collectively to a

significant improvement in basic rural services region-wide, and promote social capital formation.
These improvements had paved the way for increasing efforts to link small farmers - many
newly-endowed with water supply and electricity - to markets. Aggregate lessons and experiences
from successful pilot efforts provided a roadmap for a more organized, focused approach to
marketing small farm products under Phase II. Other Bank-supported sector investment
operations in the Northeast (education, health, land reform, micro-finance, water) and successful
projects combining rural poverty reduction and natural resources management in the Southern
regions further strengthened the poverty reduction partnership. Bank investment in analytical and
advisory work on rural poverty in the Northeast supported the next phase of investments stressing
employment and income generation, while the Bank’s rural development investments in other
parts of Latin America and the world provided knowledge relevant and transferable to Brazil.

1-.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1 The Project was an integral part of the strategy of the Government of Sergipe for rural
development with inclusion. Project Development Objectives 2 and Key Indicators and the
relationship between them are shown in the table below:

reasons/justification N/A

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The Project’s primary target group - as stated in the PAD - comprised 25,000 poor rural
families in about 670 communities in 71 of the State’s 76 municipalities. 5 Most were small-
holders, tenants, sharecroppers and landless laborers with income primarily from farming, wage

   The ICR uses the PDO as described in the PAD and Results Framework.
3
   The objective refers to “capital assets? and the Key Indicator to “household assets?. The ICR addresses both.
4
  The Project had no explicit social capital objectives but the ICR has aligned the indicator with participatory planning.
5
    The State insists it requested 20,000 families and 800 subprojects at Negotiations but these changes were not
included in the Minutes, or the pre-Board PAD. Restructuring in 2011 reduced targeted subprojects to 500, but the
beneficiary number was not addressed. The 20,000 target was generally acknowledged as correct.

labor, pensions and remittances. Secondary beneficiaries (of technical assistance/training) were
the participatory Municipal Councils, community associations and the State Technical Unit
(PRONESE). The project area covered the same 71 municipalities included in RPRP-1 with a
more intense focus on Area 1, the 41 poorest municipalities with lowest Municipal Human
Development Index (HDI-M of under 0.623) who would receive about 70% of total investment
resources for an estimated 700 subprojects. The remaining 30 municipalities (Area 2) would
receive 30% of investment resources for 300 subprojects. The inclusion of traditionally
marginalized groups - indigenous, Afro-descendent quilombolas and women - was stressed.6

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1   Four components supported project objectives (see details Annex 2):

Component 1: Community Subprojects (about 90% of total project cost) financed, through
matching grants to community associations, a planned 1,000 subprojects for small-scale socio-
economic infrastructure and services, including productive, market-linked investments with
technical assistance support. The communities themselves would identify, prioritize, execute,
operate and maintain their investments with project resources passing directly to them (Annex 2).

Component 2: Institutional Development (about 5% of total project cost), to be executed by
PRONESE, financed technical assistance and training to mobilize and strengthen the community
associations; capacity building for the participatory Municipal Councils to manage their
responsibilities under the Operational Manual; and workshops/seminars for the associations and
Councils to exchange experiences, and support Project cross-sector integration goals.

Component 3: Horizontal Integration (about 3% of total project cost) financed technical
assistance, consultancies, software acquisition, and systems installation for the State Secretariat of
Planning (SEPLAN) to strengthen its results-based management capacity to improve the planning,
integration, monitoring and evaluation of public policies and investments for poverty reduction;
improve the alignment of public expenditures with the State’s development priorities (as per the
2008-2011 PPA); and modernize the State’s public administration.

Component 4: Project Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation (about 2%
of total project cost) financed the operational costs of project administration/coordination,
supervision, monitoring, and impact evaluation.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1    Components were not revised in content but scale was reduced in one instance (see 1.7).

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 A Restructuring in 2011 amended the Loan Agreement as follows: (i) changed the
Borrower’s representative from the State Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN) to the State
Secretariat of Agriculture and Rural Development (SEAGRI); (ii) extended the Closing Date 12
months to June 30, 2012; (iii) reallocated US$638,000 from Unallocated: US$38,000 to Category

    At appraisal, 42% of total households in Sergipe – and 32% in rural areas - had women as their reference
person/head, the highest rate of all the Northeast states and among the highest nation-wide.

2, Consultant Services and Training, US$200,000 to Category 3(a) Incremental Operating Costs,
and US$400,000 to Category 3(b) Project Supervision and Monitoring. The PDO did not change,
nor project scope and design, but scale was reduced by lowering targeted subprojects from 1,000
to 500. Justifying the reallocation, the Borrower’s request cited high project operational and
supervision costs mainly from PRONESE’s centralized structure and need to physically reach
dispersed rural communities. Such costs may have been under-estimated at appraisal, and
PRONESE might have benefited from exploring ways to improve efficiency and more cost-
effectively leverage assistance in the countryside. 7 The reduced target reflected increased average
subproject cost since closure of Phase I in 2006, resulting from depreciation of the US Dollar,
inflationary pressures on construction goods and services, and the large number of tractor
subprojects in the mix with higher average cost.8

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Background analysis and lessons learned: The Project took its lead, technically and
methodologically, from 15 years of successful, innovative Bank-supported CDD projects in the
Northeast and from its immediate predecessor, the Phase 1 project which financed over 1,000
subprojects benefiting 137,000 poor rural people in 660 community associations, and established
participatory Municipal Councils in 71 municipalities. Evaluation studies reported high levels of
beneficiary satisfaction and good sustainability.9

2.1.2 The Project was anchored in the Brazil Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2008-
2011 which stressed higher value-added “paradigmatic challenges? including how to strengthen
communities’ productive activities and their integration into national and international markets by
exploiting over a decade of social capital gains and widespread, improved access to water supply
and electricity. Project design also reflected evaluation studies of similar projects/subprojects in
the States of Bahia, Ceara, Pernambuco and Piauí by the Federal University of Campinas, State of
Sao Paulo (FECAMP, 2004, 2005) and continuous research on social capital formation under the
Northeast CDD model (Costa analyses, 1994-2006).

2.1.3 The main lessons shaping design were the following: self-selection for participation had
sharpened targeting based on ex-ante socio-economic profiles of program beneficiaries region-
wide; CDD mechanisms had improved the quality and targeting of non-project resources while
leveraging additional, complementary funding through the Municipal Councils; social capital
formation had resulted directly from the participatory methodology and communities’ experience
throughout the subproject cycle, as were improved local governance and accountability; the
organizational features of CDD effectively helped small farmers link to markets as shown in the
successful cases of cashew nut, crafts, dairy products, honey and fruits which had already found
both national/international buyers and repeat contracts; and, poor rural women, indigenous




7
    The Bank repeatedly urged PRONESE to consider decentralization. PRONESE justified its decision based on the
short distances between the capital and the countryside and its preference to use resources for project promotion and
monitoring. PRONESE created five regional teams each with a civil engineer, agronomist and social specialist.
8
   Government’s request of May 25, 2011 notes that the State asked the Bank at Negotiations for a target of 800 since
inflation and exchange rate fluctuations had already eroded the possibility of achieving 1,000 subprojects. Phase I,
with the same Loan amount, had financed 1,030 subprojects.

peoples and ethnic groups had responded well to the inclusive methodology. The direct transfer
of approved subproject resources to beneficiary communities remained a design cornerstone.

2.1.4 Quality at entry: Quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The initial project
proposal was prepared in 2005 by an earlier State Government unable to resolve fiscal issues with
the Federal Government under the Fiscal Responsibility Law, preventing the proposal from
advancing. Preparation was re-opened and updated following election of a new Governor.
Safeguards analysis was of good quality and consultation with ethnic and indigenous
communities was comprehensive. Similarly, targeting arrangements were well-defined,
vulnerable groups were a priority, and the intent driving small producer commercialization was
embedded in State and Bank strategies. However, some design elements and conditions on the
ground in Sergipe merited closer scrutiny, e.g., outdated cost estimates for subprojects not
reflecting inflationary pressure on costs of materials and labor since 2006; and, erosion of
technical and managerial capacity in PRONESE, and of institutional memory and capacity in the
Councils and community associations. Widespread fiscal non-compliance 10 of community
associations was a barrier to their eligibility until regularized, a situation which direct
consultation with stakeholders might have revealed during preparation

2.1.5 PRONESE’s institutional capacity was over-estimated, possibly prompted by an overly
positive assessment of Phase I and the unit’s long-time familiarity with the project methodology.
Also, the skills erosion caused by its disengagement between projects was not perceived as a risk.
Further, project design was inherently more challenging under Phase II. Even though subproject
investment was still the primary focus and absorbed some 86% of project resources, and the basic
CDD methodology was intact, the bar was set much higher on income and asset generation,
market development, cross sector integration and leveraging of resources, and on participatory
planning and monitoring.

2.1.6 Project development objectives and key indicators: Even if the changes the project
was trying to support represented a logical extension of Phase I lessons and successes, and were
aligned with country and sector strategies, the PDO was too complex in relation to capacity and
technical assistance services available to realize it. The higher-level development objective
responded to the overwhelming demand from poor rural communities for economic inclusion,
focusing projects on strengthening community-level productive activities and market integration.
In practice, registered demand for productive investments was almost 60% of total demand. The
primary PDO sub-objective and the one which absorbed most of the investment financing - socio-
economic infrastructure – was linked closely to the income, assets and marketing sub-objective.
The third sub-objective, cross-sector integration resulting from improved participatory planning
and monitoring, directly-reflected the State’s new Multi-Year Development Plan. Also, with
hindsight, the full scope and substance of the PDO may not have been well-understood by the
Borrower, implying a lack of ownership of project design 11 and/or inadequate promotion of
project objectives and methodology to counterpart authorities and team members, especially
when those authorities turned over. Other reasons for weak ownership are suggested in 2.2.



10
   Most community associations had not submitted their annual statement of income to the Federal Government
(Receita Federal), which was required even if they were not receiving resources from any other source.

11
   The statement of PDO in the Borrower’s Final Evaluation is substantially different to the PAD or Loan Agreement
and was not corrected in the Borrower’s final version even when this discrepancy was pointed out by the Bank.


                                                        5
2.1.8 The Key Project Outcome Indicators assumed strong technical capacity and a monitoring
and evaluation effort (including participatory monitoring) of sufficient scope and focus to capture
outcomes at the local, municipal and State levels. Expected evaluation outputs included a
Baseline Study, Mid-term Review Study, Physical Performance Study, Final Evaluation with case
studies and a Borrower Completion Report, which the ICR considers excessive for a (planned)
four-year project. While the PDO did not specify/seek social capital formation, a Key Indicator
required the updating of a Social Capital Index (developed by Costa for Van Zyl et al. (2000))
using specific variables/field data. The targeted 70% of small farmers benefiting from productive
investments to have commercial contracts by closing was too tough to meet, and reflected
incorrect/overly optimistic assumptions about market viability and farmer capacity (see 2.2.1).
The Key Indicator calling for the Project to “leverage? additional financing of 5:1 (leveraged
funds to project resources) from other programs could not capture the complexity of “cross-sector
integration? but was a tangible, basic way of demonstrating how one program (the Project), using
participatory mechanisms, could catalyze access to others. Finally, the Intermediate Outcome
Indicators were too numerous, of uneven quality and lacked baselines in many cases. Some
indicators were more typical of legal covenants. There also appear to have been mixed
signals/misunderstandings at Negotiations on targets for subprojects and beneficiaries.

2.1.9 Government commitment: The State’s Multi-year Development Plan (PPA) of 2008-
2011 approved by the State Assembly at end-2007, stressed eight strategic issues of which the
Project addressed six, including local participatory planning, employment and income creation
from productive investments, and cross-sector policy integration. The State’s 2008 budget
allocation to PRONESE was largely earmarked for the Project. The State/SEPLAN was not
committed to Component 3, Horizontal Integration, at least not using project financing. Further,
the State supported the Project but hindsight shows it was not consistently invested in its
participatory methodology due to more pragmatic political and economic concerns, suggested by
the bureaucracy and multiplication of regulations affecting participatory, collective forums such
as community associations and Municipal Councils, and the bulk purchasing of tractors which
largely bypassed such mechanisms.

2.1.10 Risk Assessment: Risks were correctly projected by the PAD based on previous
experience with similar projects in other Northeast states but there were some omissions both in
types of risks suggested and planned mitigation measures. The risk associated with productive
subprojects - rated as Substantial - was correctly seen as capacity to design them but should also
have included the technical demands of their commercialization. Further, some of the suggested
mitigation measures were also beyond PRONESE’s technical capacity, e.g., ensuring that
subproject analysis explored local economic development, value chains and productive clusters.
In the case of technical assistance the real problem was not financing but supply and quality yet
appropriate training and TA were assumed at appraisal to be available. In retrospect, the risks
associated with institutional inactivity between projects were not perceived, nor was the potential
issue of cost escalation, the signs of which would have been evident at appraisal and represented
a risk to project scale and impact since the most common response is to reduce targets.

2.2 Project Implementation

2.2.1   Factors affecting implementation and outcomes:

The long hiatus between Phases I and II caused a de-mobilization of the communities,
Councils and PRONESE’s teams and eroded the capacity and momentum generated under
Phase I. Further, due to late effectiveness the Project had an actual implementation period of just
three years even counting the six-month extension of the closing date. Combined with the

                                                6
political and institutional difficulties described below, the stage was set for dysfunctional
implementation.

The State’s fiscal difficulties with the Federal Government and party political rivalries delayed
effectiveness and subsequent launching. A change of State Government prior to Board approval
resulted in considerable revision and updating of project information and data. Typically in
Brazil, projects caught between two mandates need special attention to building awareness in
incoming administrations before they commit conceptually and financially to projects. Further,
the new Secretary of Planning had not selected the existing PRONESE Coordinator and created a
special unit in SEPLAN just to monitor PRONESE’s activities, further delaying project execution.

PRONESE’s performance fell short. PRONESE is an experienced institution with a good track
record on previous Bank-supported CDD projects of similar methodology, design and target
population but its capacity to execute this project was over-estimated. Even accounting for
mitigating circumstance, the Project suffered from weak management lacking a consistent,
efficient approach. Managerial issues and their negative impacts were identified and discussed
repeatedly by Bank supervision missions, and reflected in Aide Memoires and action plans, but
matters tended to revert to the status quo following missions. PRONESE’s performance improved
in the final months despite further obstacles post-MTR, but the massive concentration of
disbursements in the final semester represents a red flag with implications noted elsewhere in this
report.

Intensification of bureaucracy was a key difference between Phases I and II. The marked
increase in bureaucracy affected all stages of the subproject approval and financing phases, driven
by a host of new requirements including state legal and fiscal obligations, environmental
licensing requirements, and immense amounts of documentation even for simple aspects. These
stemmed from Federal, State and municipal laws regulating the creation and functioning of civil
society organizations, e.g., community associations and Municipal Councils. 12 Bureaucratic
obstacles were magnified by PRONESE’s inability to streamline and gain control of their
management.

The re-registration of community associations and restructuring/unification of Councils
created further delays. The State/PRONESE began to re-register community associations, most
of which were found to have fiscal issues making them ineligible for project benefits. PRONESE
provided all required documentation and conducted workshops with project teams to equip them
to assist the communities. Momentum was maintained by finding substitute communities for
those declared in default, while assisting other communities to be re-certified. Also, of the
existing 71 Municipal Councils (CONDEMs and CMDRSs) 61 were unified as Municipal
Sustainable Development Councils (CMDS) and grouped territorially, a rational, forward-looking
but time consuming measure intended to reduce duplication and consolidate public programs
under one roof. In addition, all 71 Councils were re-structured.

Related to this issue, the State Budget Law included a clause prohibiting any transfer of funds
from the State Treasury to social and non-governmental organizations deemed of “public



12
   Environmental licensing requirements affected the processing of manioc mills (casas de farinha) of which 178 were
demanded. The entity responsible for licensing (ADEMA) kept changing the requirements resulting in none of the 23
registered proposals receiving a license and being financed, even though all conformed to well-designed and field-
tested standard designs. Further, ADEMA classified these subprojects as industrial and thus technical/other
requirements increased exponentially, making the mills too expensive to be financed by the Project.

utility?. Time was lost waiting for an amendment to cancel this requirement but when the law
was changed, a new requirement was added establishing a minimum two-year hiatus before a new
association could participate in the Project. This particularly affected ethnic and indigenous
groups which had never accessed the CDD projects and were a Phase II priority. Such situations
were as much the result of overly-stringent requirements of State and Project authorities, and
Bank procurement guidelines for CDD, as of poverty and incapacity.

The State adopted a supply-driven approach to tractor/equipment subprojects. While many
communities sought to acquire a tractor and they were a priority in Municipal Development Plans,
the lopsided nature of this demand was problematic. Tractors cost almost double the original
estimates governing the number of targeted subprojects, although they also served larger numbers
of beneficiaries per unit. Widespread acquisition of tractors raised concerns about land
management and environmental impact. Field analysis showed that some tractor/equipment
subprojects were unsuitable for existing agro-ecological conditions - suggesting technical
weakness in feasibility analysis - and had other sustainability issues. Tractors also crowded out a
more diversified, nuanced approach to the Project’s productive investments, while the
justification for using grants for this purpose was questionable. Evidence also showed that
beneficiary participation in decision-making associated with bulk-purchased tractors was
negligible, community cost-sharing rules were inconsistently applied, the multiplication of
tractors in some municipalities diluted expected returns from rental, and tractor management
capacity and O&M were questionable in the cases studied. Bank supervision missions tried to
curb investment in tractors, encountering unusually stiff resistance from the State/PRONESE.
The matter was finally resolved through the Bank’s procurement process on technical grounds
(see Section 2.4).

The Municipal Councils lacked information and resources to promote independence and
improve planning. The Operational Manual required that PRONESE transfer a portion of the
value of each subproject to the relevant Council, and inform each Council of its indicative annual
budget to guide planning and targeting. Neither occurred. PRONESE states that it did not wish to
inhibit communities from submitting proposals by informing Councils of their annual limit, but
used such a benchmark itself to maintain control over demand and ensure that the Areas 1 and 2
targeting goals were observed.13 Even so, with no idea of the parameters of financing available,
the Councils attracted over 3,400 demands (intentions to propose) from community associations
with little chance of financing. In regard to operating funds, Councils compensated by leveraging
assistance from Mayors, NGOs and labor unions but felt their autonomy was undercut.

Technical assistance and training of uneven quality and supply affected the subproject cycle.
Technical assistance was handled opportunistically by EMDAGRO, SEBRAE, NGOs and
PRONESE; there was no organized framework, partnerships, standards or regular supply.
Technical assistance and rural extension (ATER) services generally in Sergipe are fragile and
vary by region. Associations reported receiving only brief guidance when starting operations.
Bank efforts to help PRONESE reformulate TA and training post-MTR had limited impact, in
part because PRONESE expected a second extension of the closing date to provide sufficient time
to take agreed actions. This effort was aborted when further extension was denied. The Final
Evaluation provides examples of deficiencies, supported by MTR findings in the field.

    The Team maintains that resistance on the indicative budget may be explained by project resources being sufficient
to finance only two subprojects per year/per municipality, and thus the actual “indicative budget? was almost irrelevant.

The Project was unable to initiate a small farm commercialization strategy/campaign: The
PAD provided a roadmap for such activities based on successful experiences, while strong
community demand and State policy support showed that the timing was right, but achievement
was negligible. The project target for productive beneficiaries with commercial contracts was
unrealistically high and did not take into account inter alia, the need to differentiate. PRONESE
needed to scrutinize and filter demand more critically, analyze the viability of both the subproject
and the proposing association and separate out subprojects of a simple, easily-managed type more
suited to less formal local marketing arrangements, from the likely much smaller number of
ventures with serious commercial potential. It also required that PRONESE establish partnerships
with specialist agencies to leverage the technical support and networks contemplated at appraisal.
PRONESE intensified efforts in the final months including field verification of productive
subprojects and partnerships with SEBRAE and EMDAGRO but these efforts came too late to
have effect, at least within the Project.

Mid-term Review (MTR): The MTR was conducted in late 2010, without the benefit of the MTR
evaluation (completed ex-post), and leaving inadequate time to markedly revitalize the Project.
Project performance was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, reflecting implementation delays and
low disbursement. Recommendations covered the full range of issues affecting project
performance and achievement of the PDO. An Action Plan was agreed to accelerate execution but
this did not include restructuring the Results Framework to clarify intent and eliminate
inconsistencies. Safeguards, financial management and procurement performance were examined,
the latter complicated by the State’s insistence on the bulk-procurement of tractors (for which
operational issues are discussed above and procurement-related in Section 2.4). A Bank follow-up
mission in 2011 found little progress on MTR recommendations (see below).

Institutional restructuring post-MTR virtually paralyzed project execution through to closing
and counterpart funding remained an issue. The re-elected Governor sought a more strategic
approach and greater alignment with Federal Government policies and ministries, tying up key
State institutions for five months and limiting significant progress before closing. This process
included transferring PRONESE from SEPLAN to the State Secretariat of Agriculture (SEAGRI),
and replacing the Project Coordinator and management team, all at a crucial moment in project
execution. High level meetings were held in Brasilia between the Bank and new senior State
authorities to ensure broad support for an Action Plan under-pinning the 2011 amendments to the
Loan Agreement, and to ensure adequate counterpart funding which had been a limiting factor on
project implementation due to the Project’s lack of priority within the State Secretariat of Finance.
In the final months, PRONESE’s single-minded focus was on achieving the subproject target and
disbursing the Loan. Little progress was made on the Action Plan.

The Project lost priority over time. Many state governments, including Sergipe, have adopted a
more strategic approach to development financing aligned to Federal Government priorities. They
are less interested in the CDD projects per se due to the proliferation of large-scale federal and
state social and cash transfer programs providing abundant, competing resources. Even so, many
of these programs are using CDD’s participatory mechanisms to plan and allocate those resources.
This explains Government’s waning interest in the Project but the Project’s ability to leverage so
much complementary funding (see 3.2.4 – 3.2.5 and Annex 2).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 M&E Design: The PCPR-II planned to use and further upgrade the existing Management
Information System (MIS) established under the previous project, to monitor project performance
indicators, review monthly disbursement summaries and supervise implementation progress. The

                                                 9
project also planned an overly-ambitious slate of evaluation events: annual physical performance
reviews of the quality and sustainability of subprojects and reviews of community-based
procurement; case studies to assess the project’s economic impact; a Baseline Study, Physical
Performance Study, Implementation Review at Mid-term, a final Impact Evaluation and a
Borrower Completion Report. Impact evaluation design was at an advanced stage by appraisal
and proposed a quasi-experimental methodology with control groups of non-beneficiary
households.

2.3.2 Implementation: The MIS was a well-managed, modern instrument but remained
essentially a database on the subproject cycle, physical performance and fiduciary aspects,
without the envisaged capacity to measure changes in and linkages between project investments
and wellbeing/welfare, poverty reduction and/or changes in behavior. The Project financed a
Mid-term Review study (2011), and a Final Evaluation (2012) combining features of a borrower
completion report. Terms of reference were finalized late in the Project for planned Baseline and
Physical Performance studies, but they were not conducted. Monitoring and evaluation activities
were not designed to capture certain Key Indicators (updated Social Capital Index, value of
capital and household assets, impacts of product commercialization), or some of the Intermediate
Outcome Indicators. The ICR suggests, as noted elsewhere, that PRONESE may not have fully
understand the PDO, did not pay attention to monitoring the Results Framework over time, and
focused primarily on numbers of subprojects and beneficiaries.

2.3.3 Utilization/dissemination: MIS outputs and the findings of the Final Evaluation were
used for the ICR. Dissemination of project results was modest – in fact no details were provided
- in part because studies were conducted late in the Project period. The Final Evaluation was
delivered after closing and thus any dissemination events were outside the purview of the Project
but since PRONESE prepared videos and other materials showing certain key results, it is
assumed that dissemination was planned.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Environmental Safeguards: The Project was a Category B indicating that its potential
environmental impact on human populations and ecologically important areas was considered
moderate/modest. The Project triggered Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), Natural Habitats
(OP 4.04), Pest Management (OP 4.09), Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11) and Indigenous
Peoples (OP 4.10). The Project had an Environmental Management Plan (EMP, 2008) and an
Indigenous and Afro-Descendent People’s Development Framework. While small-scale, all
individual investments were expected to comply with Federal and State environmental laws and
new screening/other requirements. Environmental screening of proposed subprojects was
standard practice. PRONESE established an Environmental Quality Technical Group (NTGA),
and offered financing for new, demonstration environmental subprojects.

2.4.2 Environmental Safeguards compliance was satisfactory, as determined by Bank
specialists during field supervision but performance on newly-introduced elements was
inconsistent especially demonstration environmental subprojects, mobilization/training and the
NTGA. Survey data show that demand-driven rural projects in the Northeast - an environmentally
fragile region - would benefit from expanding their vision beyond screening and compliance to
investment in conservation and recovery. Demand for environmental subprojects was modest due
to: PRONESE’s lack of proactivity in building community awareness of their substance or
potential; failure to promote their demonstration value; and, a general lack of technical specialists
to prepare such subprojects or landowners interested in “hosting? them. Of the 55 such

                                                 10
subprojects proposed, none was financed.14 It is also evident that environmental licensing and
other screening could not prevent in-house errors in technical analysis which affected
environmental and subproject sustainability.

2.4.3 The beneficiary survey shows that environmental training was conducted mostly at the
point of subproject completion with no follow-up. About 23.7% of beneficiaries/association
leaders surveyed confirmed some awareness, stating that they were “using the tractor with more
care for the land?, “collecting petrol cans?, “repairing paths after the rains?, “preserving the
margins of rivers and streams?, “not cutting the trees?, “fishing within legal limits?, and
“monitoring erosion?. Future projects in this region need to build on this, as 67% showed no
awareness of such issues and a high 77% lacked any knowledge of the need for or purpose of an
environmental license despite it being a requirement for financing of most subprojects.15

2.4.3 Social safeguards - indigenous and ethnic peoples: The Project’s relationship with and
inclusion of indigenous peoples and quilombola communities was governed by a Development
Framework/Strategy prepared in consultation with such groups, public authorities and specialists
and widely discussed at a series of Municipal Conferences for Territorial Planning coordinated by
SEPLAN. Consistent efforts were made by PRONESE to ensure that these groups had access to
and benefited from the Project. There were 18 subprojects financed for 10 quilombola
communities (mostly cisterns, fishing equipment, cultural activities, and digital inclusion - see
Annex 2) valued at US$726,000 or an average cost of some US$40,300, on par with the overall
average cost. Two subprojects (fishing equipment and women’s crafts) totaling close to
US$60,000 were financed for the State’s Xoco indigenous group.

Fiduciary compliance:

2.4.4 Financial Management (FM): Financial management supervision by Bank specialists
in February 2008 and September 2009 rated project financial arrangements as Satisfactory and
FM risk as Moderate. Supervision in October 2011 downgraded the FM rating to Moderately
Unsatisfactory with control risk rated Moderate due to some deficiencies likely to affect the
provision of timely information needed to monitor resources management and project
implementation. This rating was maintained by the final FM supervision in March 2012.

2.4.5 Audit: Audit performance was Moderately Satisfactory. The first audit covering project
effectiveness (July 17, 2009) through end-December 2010 was received late and auditors’ opinion
was qualified. A revised audit addressed key points in the audit report to the Bank’s satisfaction.
It was agreed that the Borrower would present the next two audit reports on June 30, 2012
(covering January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011) and April 30, 2013 (covering January 1, 2012
to October 31, 2012). The 2011 audit report was delivered on time and was unqualified. The 2011
audit report asked PRONESE to conduct a technical audit of community subprojects, particularly



14
   The Borrower also asserts that at the time the Councils were preparing their Annual Action Plans some communities
presented environmental demands but when it came time to establish priorities, they opted for other types of
subprojects with greater priority at that time.
15
   Also, since 57.1% said there was no environmental impact from their subproject and 38.4% did not respond, no
measures were introduced to study, minimize or resolve impacts.




                                                        11
those executed in the final semester. This exercise will be self-funded and PRONESE’s report is
expected by March 2013.

2.4.6 Procurement: An initial Procurement Post-Review in 2009 rated the project Satisfactory
overall with a risk rating of Average. Follow-up during the Mid-term Review in 2010 found that
community procurement complied with the Procurement Plan and Operational Manual but due to
some recommendations from the previous review not having been implemented, the risk rating
for procurement processes was rated Substantial and overall rating downgraded to Moderately
Satisfactory. Procurement performance was then downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
by the final supervision mission/ISR due to issues affecting price quotations for water cisterns. A
set of measures to increase overall transparency of procurement processes was discussed and a
follow-up Independent Procurement Review analyzed 12 such subprojects resulting in an Action
Plan. The Bank’s Procurement and Financial Management specialists reported that PRONESE’s
compliance with the Plan had been good. PRONESE adopted all of the Bank’s recommendations
which were also transmitted to PRONESE’s field technicians and the Municipal Councils.

2.4.7 Tractors: The MTR Procurement Post Review identified an NCB bidding process for
procurement of 140 tractors (plus ancillary equipment) estimated at over US$5.0 million. The
framework contract that resulted from this bidding provided for partial acquisitions and deliveries
over a one-year period. At the time of the Post Review, only 69 tractors had actually been
purchased for a total US$3.0 million. The MTR mission discussed this issue with the Secretary
of Planning and both parties agreed that the Loan could finance the 69 but that PRONESE should
not purchase the remainder under the Loan to avoid reaching the ICB threshold which could have
triggered other measures by the Bank. The Bank gave its no objection to purchase of the 69
tractors but declined the remaining 71. Operational implications of bulk-purchased tractors are
noted in Section 2.2.

2.4.8 Project costs, disbursement and financing: Total project cost was US$24.59 million,
about 93.8% of the appraisal estimate of US$27.10 million. The Bank contribution was US$18.49
million (88.9% of the Loan amount and 72.5% of total cost), the State Government contributed
US$4.43 million (115.6%) and the Beneficiaries US$US$2.19 million (90.50%). The cost of
Component 4 (Project Administration) was 311% of the appraisal estimate. Disbursement was
extremely slow as shown by Sections G and I of the Data Sheet; almost half of all disbursements
occurred in the final six months (see 3.2). The Borrower was unable to fully disburse the Loan in
the time available and the Bank refused to consider further extension of the closing date. There
will be a cancellation of some US$2.31 million.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Transition arrangements to regular operations: Under longstanding rules for the
Northeast Brazil CDD projects in the subproject post-completion stage (with few exceptions such
as rural electrification investments/connections where the local power company assumes
responsibility for safety and business reasons) the community association assumes legal
ownership of its subproject and is responsible for its management, operation and maintenance.

2.5.2 Operation and maintenance arrangements: Survey evidence (Final Evaluation 2012)
shows an uneven picture of O&M capacity and practices depending on the type of subproject:
42% of those surveyed confirmed that they had adopted procedures and financing arrangements
for O&M, and 13% said their subprojects were recently-completed and they had yet to consider
O&M (see Annex 5). The planned Physical Performance Study would have systematically


                                                12
analyzed this question but was not conducted. The Evaluation cites examples of issues found in
the field: (i) the link between a community’s ability to pay for the operational costs/labor of a
tractor or ice-making plant and its proper management, including utilization rates and charges; (ii)
need for training in subproject management extending beyond the completion and hand-over
period; (iii) the high technical and financial inputs required to maintain exotic breeds unsuited to
local conditions and knowledge; and (iv) predictable difficulties associated with untrained rural
communities managing public goods such as computers. While these may be atypical within the
full range of subprojects implemented, they illustrate a chain of issues extending back to the
subproject selection, analysis and approval stages as well as the quality and quantity of the TA
and training essential for longer-term sustainability. In regard to the 210 subprojects financed in
the final semester, PRONESE is partnering with EMDAGRO to promote good O&M practices,
and as noted (2.4.5) will conduct a technical audit of completion, quality and functionality and
report findings to the Bank.

2.5.3 Sustaining achievements and institutional capacity: The sustainability of project
achievements and institutional capacity is less clear under Phase II than its predecessor and the
risk is rated Substantial (see 2.5.2). PRONESE’s agreement (in writing, as stated in the Borrower
Letter, Annex 7) to provide technical assistance to completed subprojects, with EMDAGRO’s
support, may mitigate this. Even so, the issue of subproject sustainability extends beyond the
physical, as demonstrated by the economic/financial analysis (Annex 3). The sustainability of
local institutions - community associations and Municipal Councils - appears positive based on
survey results. Re-estimation of the Social Capital Index would have substantiated this in an
organized way. However, Councils’ lack of financial autonomy and continued dependence on the
Mayors persist. Also, taking mitigating circumstances into account, PRONESE did not
demonstrate significant institutional growth under Phase II and its capacity to manage the Project
efficiently remained problematic through closing as evidenced by disbursement and other factors.
It is assumed that SEPLAN benefited from results-based management and evaluation training,
and that institutionalizing their use will promote sustainability.

2.5.4 Follow-on operation: There will not be a follow-on CDD-type operation in Sergipe.
The proposed Development Policy Loan (DPL) of US$150.0 million for “Sergipe Development
through Inclusion? is rooted in the State’s new Multi-Year Plan (2012-2015) and would cover
three main policy areas: consolidating fiscal management and public sector innovations;
increasing access to better quality public services in health and education; and, promoting socio-
economic development and inclusive growth in the interior of the State. The direct connection to
rural populations is indicated by several Key Outcome Indicators. 16 The targeted farmer
population will have the same socio-economic profile as the Project. The emphasis on organized
marketing of small farm production is positive, picking up a crucial but unachieved sub-objective
of the Project under review.

3. Assessment of Outcomes



16
  Increase by ten-fold the number of trained small producer units included in Milk Production Units ( Nucleos de
Producao de Leite) and selling 90% of their production to private and public institutional markets; incomes of
households participating in Balde Cheio in the irrigated perimeter of Jabiberi are doubled; and, increase by 20% the
number of small producers included in the Program for Agro-ecological Production and linked to the Social Control
Organizations (NGOs) selling directly in agro-ecological fairs and to private and public/institutional markets. Seasonal
workers and women would also benefit from technical training and literacy courses.


                                                          13
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 The objectives and core methodology remain relevant to the Bank’s country and global
priorities. In conceptual and substantive terms project design for similar Northeast populations is
shifting away from demand-driven investments in basic socio-economic infrastructure. This is
not because CDD is no longer relevant but because competing programs are providing the same
services, some Northeast states have achieved almost blanket coverage of basic services, poor
communities with water supply and electricity are demanding productive opportunities and jobs
and can voice their demands through the established - CDD-created - participatory institutions.
The move into productive, integrated activities explicitly targeted to market penetration,
employment and income generation with associated public policy and human development goals,
is exemplified by the DPL described in 2.5.3. The participatory framework established and
consolidated by CDD over two decades, i.e., the community associations and Municipal Councils,
remains a relevant, effective mechanism for the large scale delivery of policies and services in
rural areas, and to pilot and expand innovation including productive.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1   Objective 1: Improve the access of the rural poor to basic socio-economic infrastructure.

Achieved: The Project implemented 547 basic socio-economic infrastructure subprojects (109%)
benefiting 22,006 families (110%) organized in 442 community associations in 67 municipalities
of the 71 eligible. While the Data Sheet shows a concentration of disbursements in the final
semester, the vast majority of subprojects financed in this period were physically completed by
project closing. The 210 subprojects implemented in this period comprised water cisterns (147)
and water distribution facilities (63) which are of simple design, rapidly-executed and in high
demand from poor communities in semiarid zones given current severe drought conditions in
semiarid zones of the Northeast region including Sergipe (see Annex 2). PRONESE teams are
accompanying these newer subprojects to promote sustainability through good O&M practices.
PRONESE has signed an agreement for technical assistance from EMDAGRO (see Borrower
Letter, Annex 7), and will conduct a technical audit of completion quality and functionality.

By type of investment: 231 were basic infrastructure, 247 were productive, and 69 were social.
There were no environmental subprojects (see 2.4.1-2.4.3). Targeting by priority Areas 1 and 2
was successful. Area 1 poorest families received 74% of total investments in subprojects (target
65%) and 74% of total subprojects. Some 30.36% of all productive subprojects (87% of target)
were led by women; female-led associations accounted for 30.3% of all subprojects (86.6% of
target). Notably, 50.27% of total beneficiary households were female-headed (see also Annex 2,
para. 2.8). Ten quilombola communities - about 40% of those formally-recognized by the
benchmark Palmares Foundation - benefited from 18 investments, while the indigenous
community of Xoko received two investments. Beneficiaries surveyed reported that while these
subprojects almost universally improved quality of life and wellbeing, they did not affect families’
poverty status which – as the beneficiaries themselves stated - requires multiple, integrated and
intensive interventions.

3.2.3 Objective 2: Raise incomes and capital assets through investments in productive
activities and increased linkages between small producers and markets.

Partially-achieved: This sub-objective was essentially the Project’s “core?. Its success depended
on the financing and management of sustainable productive activities which could be marketed in


                                                14
an organized manner either through smaller, local venues or where feasible, in more advanced
commercial settings under contractual arrangements. It called for strong technical analysis and
support services, partnerships and network-building, elements which PRONESE proved - in this
instance - unable to provide itself or proactively leverage elsewhere. The Project made little
headway on promoting contractual linkages between small producers and markets (see 2.2), and
thus income generation did not receive the “push? planned at appraisal. While income results
suggest that small producers are involved in marketing activities – and it is known that about 30%
of productive beneficiaries were selling their product, mostly locally - no strategy or organized
campaigns were developed to facilitate, intensify or monitor this process. The following shows
results with further details/analysis in Annexes 2 and 3:

The Project financed 247 productive subprojects - about 45.3% of all subprojects actually
financed - benefiting over 10,800 families;17 Incomes increased in value terms for all sampled
subprojects in the year post-investment but the percentage increase is not known due to lack of a
baseline for comparison. Average incomes of 1,175 families with productive subprojects
increased R$2,033/family, and incomes of 399 families with infrastructure subprojects increased
R$704/family. Two quilombola associations benefited with fishing equipment investments saw
incomes increase by R$1,617 (equipment only) and R$7,475 (equipment and boats). Analysis
shows (Section 3.3 and Annex 3) that 54% of sampled subprojects are generating robust
economic results, with positive income potential. On the other hand, 46%-32% are generating
marginal or negative economic returns depending on assumptions about future development of
mechanization services. Capital assets increased in value terms by US$990 per family based on
average total investment of families with productive investments (Annex 3, Tables 1-6 and Box).
Household assets (defined as non-productive assets, e.g., water cisterns) increased on average
$1,474 for families benefited by such cisterns (Annex 3, Tables 1-6 and Box).

3.2.4 Objective 3: Strengthen the cross-sector integration of investments in rural areas
through improved participatory planning and monitoring at the local, municipal and State levels.

Substantial achievement: The implementation strategy for Phase II contemplated preparation of
a proposal for integrating public policies and leveraging complementary resources through the
Project, with the Councils and associations as the main vehicles, along with SEPLAN which
under the Horizontal Integration component would be trained to take the lead at the State level.
The overall effort gained greater dynamism following PRONESE’s transfer to SEAGRI in 2011.
It was shaped and intensified by a broad-based debate concerning the programs and projects most
consistent with demands surveyed in the countryside. Much of the demand from poor rural
populations was identified through the Councils, then mapped and channeled by PRONESE to the
agencies responsible for these programs.

3.2.5 Over the course of the Project, PRONESE leveraged complementary resources totaling
US$135.3 million, or a ratio of 1:6 in project investment funds to leveraged resources.
Partnerships were established with the State Secretariat of Economic Development and
Technology responsible for the Program for Strengthening Local Productive Arrangements along
with CODEVASF, the latter also responsible for water supply and sanitation investments; DESO
and COHIDRO invested in the larger scale infrastructure supporting project investments in water
supply; other key partners were EMDAGRO and PRONAF, as well as the Federal Ministry of
Social Development through its food security program, and the Ministry of Agrarian


17
   The PDO refers to “capital assets? and the Key Indicator measures “household assets?. See Annex 3, Box 3.14.1 for
discussion of relative results.

                                                        15
Development through PROINF which supported the marketing of some family agriculture
products. 18 The beneficiary profile of the Project and these programs is very similar. See Annex 2.

3.2.6 Improved participatory planning played an important role in this outcome and derived
from several sources including training of the unified CMDSs in the objectives and “machinery?
of integration and in the Operational Manual. Associations surveyed understood the benefits of
collective planning and decision-making, and that the integration of benefits from complementary
programs accessed through their Municipal Councils was a path out of poverty. The unification
process preserved Project-mandated ratios for civil society representation ranging from 50-80%,
including at least 50% of all quilombola communities. This improved the flow of information,
complementarity of local planning and interventions, inclusion, and the cost-effective allocation
and use of public resources.19 All proposed subprojects were consistent with the annual Municipal
Development Plan, itself the product of a wide-ranging, consultative process. Council unification
- seating large-scale Federal and State public programs in a democratic, participatory forum
which included the Project/PRONESE - promoted resource leveraging. An estimated 69% of
community associations said they had accessed other financing after participating in the Project.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 The Final Evaluation (2012) randomly-selected 37 Project-financed subprojects to assess
their financial and economic results. These included 23 productive investment subprojects, 12
community infrastructure subprojects and 2 socio-cultural subprojects. An economic and
financial analysis examined this sample, with results summarized below and details in Annex 3.

3.3.2 Benefits: In broad terms, the benefits estimated for the various subprojects are as
follows: for milking equipment, the reduction of labour costs; for improved goat herds, increased
milk production; for the ice-making facility, reduction of input costs and time savings of
fishermen; for tractors and equipment, improved crop productivity due to better timing of main
agricultural tasks to coincide with the rainy season, and reduction of input costs; for road
infrastructure (fords), reduced production losses (e.g., milk) associated with precarious transport
conditions on dirt roads during the rainy season; and for drinking water infrastructure, reduction
of family time spent procuring water, and municipal costs for operating water tanker trucks.
Benefits from musical instruments were qualitatively identified but the information obtained did
not permit a value assessment. Benefits for digital facilities were not valued since the sample
subproject was not in operational condition. Other benefits could have been generated which were
not valued. Thus, the estimated economic and financial IRR should be interpreted as minimum
returns.

3.3.3 Economic analysis: The economic Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal rate of Return
(IRR) of the 37 subprojects assessed were US$1,136,500 and 30% respectively - an average NPV
of US$ 30,700 per subproject. The aggregate total investment cost was US$1,595,100 of which
81% was funded by the Project and 19% was provided by beneficiary groups as their counterpart
contribution. The average figures per beneficiary family were: US$680 as the economic NPV;

   PRONAF (National Family Agriculture Company); CODEVASF (Company to Develop the Sao Francisco Valley);
SENAC (National Commercial Training Service); CHESF (Sao Francisco Hydro-Electric Company); SEBRAE
(Brazilian Service for Support to Small and Medium Business), and Bank of Brazil.

   Unification brought together the CONDEMs (Municipal Councils co-managing the Bank-supported CDD projects,
the National Family Agriculture Program (PRONAF), and the National Land Reform Program ( Programa Nacional de
Credito Fundiario, PNCF), and the CMDRSs (Municipal Sustainable Rural Development Councils), into a new entity,
the Municipal Sustainable Development Council (CMDS).

                                                     16
US$730 as the incremental net benefit in the assessed year; a reduction of 5 person-days as the
incremental annual labour use; and US$750 as the total investment cost. If other project costs are
taken into account (US$210 per family) the overall economic IRR would be 22%; the economic
NPV per family would be US$660; and the aggregate economic NPV for the project (with 21,970
beneficiary families) would be US$14.5 million (higher than the partial estimate at appraisal). On
the other hand, 12-17 of the 37 subprojects showed an IRR below 10% and thus a negative NPV.
This implies that 46%-32% of subprojects are generating marginal or negative economic returns,
depending on assumptions of future scenarios.

3.3.4 Financial analysis: The analysis included 23 subprojects, namely those for production
support: milking equipment; goat production support; ice production; fishing equipment and
agricultural mechanisation. The financial NPV and IRR of the 23 subprojects assessed were
US$707,400 and 39% respectively - an average NPV of US$30,760 per subproject. The aggregate
total investment cost was US$1,133,700 of which 74% was funded by the Project and 26% was
provided by beneficiary groups as their counterpart contribution. The average figures per
beneficiary family were: US$620 as the economic NPV; US$810 as the incremental net benefit in
the assessed year; a reduction of 4 person-days as the incremental annual labour use; and US$990
as the total investment cost. In summary, the overall financial IRR would be 39%, and the
aggregate financial NPV for productive subprojects (with 10,800 beneficiary families) would be
US$6.2 million. On the other hand, 8-13 of the 23 subprojects showed an IRR below 10% and
thus negative NPV. This implies that 56%-35% of subprojects are generating marginal or
negative financial returns, depending on assumptions of future scenarios.

3.3.5 Sensitivity analysis: Regarding the sensitivity of results, the project benefits derived
from families’ increased production and reduced labor costs could be reduced to 50% and
generate an economic IRR of 23% for all subprojects and a financial IRR of 9% for all productive
subprojects. The proportion of subprojects with low economic IRR (less than 10%) would
increase from 46% to 54%, while the proportion of productive subprojects with low financial IRR
would increase from 49% to 56%. It can be concluded that total projected benefits can be
significantly less and still be above the opportunity cost, due to the robust economic and financial
results of 54-51% of subprojects.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
3.4.1 Justification of the overall outcome rating is as follows: (i) Relevance: Project objectives
remain relevant to the needs of poor rural communities in Sergipe based on the volume of
demand generated by the Project, and direct evidence of pervasive, persistent deficits in basic
infrastructure, productive employment and income opportunities in all communities surveyed,
and the need for cross-sector integration to accelerate and deepen poverty reduction; (ii)
Achievement of PDO: The scale of investment activity was well below the original intent of the
Project and communities’ expressed needs. Important, planned activities that would have boosted
outcomes did not occur. However, indirect evidence suggests that families’ capital and household
assets increased. To the extent that the indicator could capture the complexities of cross-sector
integration, it was achieved based on successful resource leveraging results. The critical issue is
sustainability and the factors involved are suggested in Section 4; and (iii) Efficiency: The overall
project IRR is 22% (compared to the appraisal estimate of 10%), the average economic IRR of
subprojects is 30%, and the average financial IRR of productive subprojects only is 39%
compared to 25% estimated at appraisal. However, investment efficiency and sustainability are
questionable for a substantial portion and the results are boosted by the good returns on about half.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 Poverty targeting outcomes, women’s participation and the benefits delivered to ethnic
and indigenous groups are already discussed in Section 3.2.

Social development:
3.5.2 Youth: Young people were not explicitly targeted at appraisal but from the start their
entrepreneurial potential was acknowledged, their organization was promoted, and involvement
in the Councils was encouraged by PRONESE. Training and opportunities for leadership
development and learning were provided. They became important clients of the Project through
investments in 28 Nucleos de Inclusão Digital subprojects financing computers, software and
training, and 24 investments in musical instruments and associated equipment/training.

3.5.3 Social capital formation: The Project results framework included a Key Indicator for
social capital formation even though the PDO had no explicit social capital goals. The indicator
sought a “30% improvement in a social capital index (SCI) by end -project, as reported by project
beneficiaries?. The SCI was first used in Van Zyl et al (2000) and measured a specific set of
variables but appropriate data to re-estimate the SCI were not collected by the Project. The ICR
summarizes survey results in Section 3.2 and Annex 5 which suggest social capital growth but the
evidence is not sufficiently rigorous to make definitive statements.

3.5.4 Strong evidence is suggested by Binswanger et al. (2009) which used econometric
methods for quantitative analysis of changes in the level of social capital in communities and
municipalities in three Northeast States (Rio Grande do Norte, Ceara and Piaui) which had
implemented Bank-supported CDD projects identical in methodology and target population to
Phase II in Sergipe.20 The study interviewed municipal, community and household subjects to
assess the projects’ social capital formation capacity. Various methods were used to control for
effects external to the projects. (See findings in Annex 2, paras 2.23-2.26). Evolution of the
Councils in Sergipe inter alia, through their unification, territorial scope, and leveraging activities,
is consistent with Binswanger’s conclusions. Further, the State Government has since 2007
routinely exploited participatory mechanisms and networks created and consolidated by the
Northeast CDD projects in Sergipe - including the Project under review – to implement their
territorial planning agenda and to involve new social actors in local and municipal decisions.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.5 As stated elsewhere, the project experience suggests that institutional change and growth
were not notable features of this project, at least in regard to PRONESE, SEPLAN and
EMDAGRO. The unification of the Councils into forums representing diverse programs and the
success of PRONESE’s leveraging activities within this new format, suggest substantial
institutional growth and consolidation. The community associations remain variable in capacity
and maturity but signs of evolution include the high percentage that have independently accessed
new financing since their Phase II subproject.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.6 Baixo Sao Francisco: During signature of the Loan Agreement, an understanding was
reached between the State of Sergipe and the Bank’s Brazil Country Office to prepare a pilot
project to develop the Baixo Sao Francisco region, one of the State’s most vulnerable. Based on
results, a larger project would follow covering other very poor regions of the State. Coordination
was assigned to SEPLAN/PRONESE and project resources were to finance a Plan for the Social
Development of the Baixo Sao Francisco. Because the Project was extended only six months and
due to implementation delays, the Plan was not prepared although TORs were agreed. The State
Secretariat of Social Development did follow up on agreed actions to include poor communities
in social protection policies/projects, and under the new Brasil Sem Miseria Strategy, all states
prepared plans to eradicate extreme poverty for which Federal resources are available. The
proposed Sergipe DPL supports policy action on productive inclusion of the poorest.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 The Final Evaluation (2012) interviewed 224 community association members/leaders as
well as members of 33 Municipal Councils in seven of the eight State territories. Responses from
the associations included the following (see Annex 5): (i) 78.6% said their subprojects created
opportunities for productive activities and income, improved quality of life, access to information,
infrastructure and cultural heritage restoration; (ii) a majority said women and men participated
equally, that participation did not depend on educational level, and 57% said they were formal
members of an association; (iii) 50% lacked any knowledge of subproject preparation, suggesting
a concentration of information in the association leadership, and uneven participation; (iv) 81.3%
however, reported direct involvement in subproject execution through participation in meetings,
financial contributions, and labor; and (v) 38.4% said that they felt empowered to obtain new
financing after their subproject. See also Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

4.1      Sustainability: This rating takes into account the following: (i) robust economic and
financial results for about half of all productive subprojects balanced by marginal or negative
returns/prospects for the remainder; (ii) unclear outlook regarding O&M with 42% confirming
O&M was under control, a situation expected to improve with PRONESE’s formal undertaking in
December 2012 to accompany the 210 subprojects implemented in the final semester to promote
good O&M practices, and to conduct a technical audit of their completion, quality and
functionality; (iii) weak ATER services in Sergipe, and lack of time to execute the training and
registration program for TA providers agreed in the final Action Plan; (iv) failure to establish an
organized marketing strategy and operational framework, limiting the potential of many
productive investments; (v) questions about the environmental soundness of tractor investments
and insufficient training and awareness-building in subproject environmental management; and,
(vi) unlikely further Bank support for the Northeast CDD model in Sergipe.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1 This rating balances a set of positive and negative factors. Among the positive: (i) use of
tested methodologies, incorporation of lessons, and transfer of investment financing directly to

                                                19
communities; (ii) direct relevance to the State’s rural strategy and the Bank’s CPS; (iii) well-
analyzed Safeguards based on consultation with ethnic/indigenous peoples; (iv) serious intent to
insert small farmers into marketing chains; (v) innovations designed to institutionalize resource
leveraging through the Councils, policy integration and participatory planning; and, on the
negative side, (vi) inadequate attention to the potential impact on capacity and costs of the hiatus
between Phases I and II; (vii) overly ambitious PDO, indicators and evaluation program and
evidence of hasty preparation of some indicators; (viii) need for tougher scrutiny of PRONESE’s
capacity to lead a small farmer marketing strategy/campaign and for assistance to PRONESE to
build needed technical capacity and partnerships up front; (ix) a broader consultation with
stakeholders including the Councils might have detected the widespread fiscal irregularity of
community associations much earlier. By the time the Project became effective, the operational
strategy and content were not matched by institutional capacity on the ground.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.2 This rating reflects the following: (i) supervision missions were regular and well-reported,
close attention was paid to social and environmental Safeguards, financial management and
procurement, and to systematically following-up agreed actions; (ii) the Project was challenging
and difficult to supervise but benefited from a stable, experienced Bank team and single TTL
throughout its execution; (iii) ratings were generally realistic; (iv) the contentious issue of tractor
procurement was managed/resolved on sound technical grounds; (v) the Bank team consistently
provided substantive support and guidance to the Borrower to improve project implementation;
however: (vi) exceedingly slow disbursement and its underlying causes needed a bolder Bank
approach with consequences conveyed clearly to the Borrower; (vii) the environmental
subprojects and their potentially valuable demonstration effects needed more attention; (viii)
excessive evaluation requirements warranted rationalization and re-design consistent with the
time remaining; and (ix) the flawed Results Framework should have been restructured early on.
The decision not to grant a longer extension of the closing date is questionable, but the Bank
Team believes that in view of the overall history of project execution and institutional
performance, additional time was unlikely to change outcomes. Early closure may even have
been preferable.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.3 The Moderately Unsatisfactory rating overall reflects the Bank’s generally strong,
responsive performance at both the preparation and supervision stages tempered by certain
deficiencies relating to complexity, and to predictive or preventative actions which might have
promoted efficiency, improved conditions on the ground and/or arrested or forestalled decline.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.1 This rating reflects the following elements of Government’s performance: (i) beneficial
unification of the Councils, institutionalization of participatory planning mechanisms originally
piloted by Bank-supported CDD operations, and adoption of a territorial approach designed to
facilitate the cost-effective integration of programs; (ii) initiative in proposing Baixo Sao
Francisco pilot operation to test a methodology for subsequent scaling up, influencing in part, the

                                                  20
concept and content of the proposed DPL; but (iii) declining commitment to or interest in the
Project due to the abundant availability of alternative development resources; (iv) inconsistent
approach to the Project’s participatory ethic in certain cases; (v) erratic counterpart funding
performance over time; (vi) moving PRONESE and replacing the project Coordinator/managers
at a critical take-off point; (vii) lack of commitment to the Horizontal Integration component, or
at least to financing same with project funds as agreed.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.2 For reasons already stated, PRONESE’s performance fell short of expectations and is
rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. PRONESE faced many difficulties, some of which were beyond
its control, yet showed good performance inter alia, in meeting or exceeding basic targets for
subprojects and beneficiaries, adhering closely to project targeting design, to the inclusion of
vulnerable populations, and to leveraging complementary resources. The Project’s three year time
frame was too short and is viewed as a mitigating factor. Nevertheless, the following weigh
heavily on the rating: (i) lack of a consistent, efficient approach to project management and on
occasion disregard for or inability to generate an organized response to Bank efforts to help
improve performance; (ii) extremely slow progress throughout and rushed execution in the final
stages; (iii) mismanagement of procurement in specific instances; (iv) weak performance on some
parts of the PDO; (v) non-disbursement of 10% of the Loan; and (vi) failure to conduct key
studies. The conclusion is that PRONESE had difficulty effectively managing the Project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.3 Overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. This takes into
account a series of political, technical and institutional factors including problematic relationships
within the Borrower agencies/team and an apparent disengagement from the Project due to its
reduced priority in the State’s social development “universe? now characterized by many
competing, well-funded Federal and State programs. Above all, the efficiency and sustainability
of project outcomes is questionable.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1.1    The following lessons are among the most important:
         Targeting goes well beyond ensuring that project benefits reach the neediest. It is also
a function of matching subprojects to communities’ financial, managerial and technical capacity,
and their knowledge of local conditions, in the equation supporting approval. This requires in turn
analytical capacity appropriate to the subprojects proposed and direct knowledge of the physical
and environmental characteristics of the subproject locale and a realistic assessment of technical
assistance availability.
         Fomenting community demand without commensurate capacity or resources to filter,
evaluate, approve and finance the resulting proposals serves no useful purpose. In this case it
was the outcome of poorly-designed information campaigns and well-intentioned Councils
without guidance on the financing likely to be available in a given year. Information
strategies/campaigns need careful design, e.g., differentiation of messages to targeted groups on
both poverty and capacity grounds, phased over time to govern intake, matched by specialist
skills leveraged to ensure proper analysis and the differentiation of proposals based on social or
commercial objectives and suitability.


                                                 21
         The inclusion of “environmental subprojects? implies a significant task in a CDD
context of information dissemination, technical assistance and awareness-building. Such
investments have an important role in moving the Northeast CDD projects beyond environmental
compliance to conservation and recuperation on the ground in a fragile, environmentally
degraded region. Given the difficulties in convincing poor rural communities that environmental
investments have value, efforts need to start at an easily-grasped level such as local garbage
disposal, avoiding deforestation, and proper use of pesticides, aimed at demonstrating, scaling up,
and potentially moving on to changing farming/natural resource management practices and
systems.
         The sourcing and quality of technical assistance is as important as its financing and
needs attention from the earliest stages of project development. Allocating a portion of
project/subproject cost for technical assistance cannot resolve the fundamental problem of the
scarcity and quality of such services in rural areas or the need to build up those services over time.
Studies and direct experience consistently show that TA quality and quantity are a top priority for
rural development stakeholders in Sergipe and other states.
         Cross sector integration/leveraging is a complex, challenging and long-term process
intended to maximize the cost-effectiveness and impact of development/poverty reduction
programs and policies. An individual project may only evaluate a small piece of this framework
but this will make an invaluable contribution to larger efforts. Under this project, cross-sector
integration was largely assumed to be happening - with evidence based on successful leveraging
activities - but the mechanisms, policy and institutional relationships, and role of the Councils
were not well-understood. An opportunity was lost to develop the knowledge base to advance
such efforts.
         The design of the monitoring and evaluation framework for a given project must take
into account the information expected at end-project and how the Project will obtain it Starting
with a clear understanding of project objectives and their link to the results framework, a more
flexible, diverse series of evaluation exercises - fewer large scale studies and more targeted
analyses - should aim to directly respond to the PDO by closing. If certain indicators are
unsuitable or unrealistic, adjustments should be addressed as early as possible. Turnover in the
Borrower’s management team requires an intensive effort to help the new group understand and
buy into project objectives, the results framework and project methodology and to keep M&E on
track.
         The Project re-confirmed the longstanding lesson of CDD, that beneficiary
involvement throughout the subproject cycle is essential for suitable, well-targeted and
sustainable subprojects. Supply-driven interventions which either consciously or inadvertently
bypass established participatory mechanisms can have negative effects which are not easily
reversed.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1.1 The following summarizes the main points from the Borrower’s letter of December 13,
2012 commenting on the Bank’s draft ICR, with Bank Team response in each case:

Borrower: Initial execution was compromised by unforeseen events and factors which were
identified and discussed exhaustively, and overcome in the project’s final stages as shown by the
project’s recovery and achievement of targets.
Bank: The ICR acknowledges a series of factors affecting execution (see Section 2.2) as well as
the Project’s achievement of key targets.



                                                 22
Borrower: The success of Phase I influenced the definition of targets and indicators under Phase
II but they were very ambitious and exceeded execution capacity, especially given the time lapse
between Phases I and II.
Bank: The ICR agrees, and describes the link between Phase I and unrealistic targets for Phase II.
Borrower: PRONESE disagrees with the overall rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory. Huge
effort was dedicated to achieving project targets especially in the final stages; a longer extension
would have guaranteed a better quality recovery.
Bank: The MU rating reflects the Bank’s concerns regarding sustainability which are linked not
only to the large number of subprojects executed in the final semester, but also the
marginal/negative economic and financial results of subprojects sampled, and other factors. The
Bank believes project closure was the correct decision.
Borrower: The State Government is committed, given Bank concerns about the sustainability of
subprojects, to providing continuous support, technical assistance and rural extension based on an
Action Plan to be sent to the Bank by December 31, 2012.
Bank: The Bank commends PRONESE for committing to continuous support to ensure the
success of community subprojects, especially those implemented in the final semester.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

2.1      Drawing on the Project archive including the Borrower’s Final Evaluation
(SEAGRI/PRONESE 2012) and Borrower Completion Report (SEAGRI/PRONESE 2012), the
following summarizes the main achievements/outputs under individual components by end of
project:

2.2     Component 1: Community Subprojects (US$24.2 million, about 90% of total project
cost) was to finance via matching grants to community associations (CA), about 1,000
subprojects for small-scale socio-economic infrastructure, as well as productive and market-
oriented investments intended to improve the livelihoods and wellbeing of about 100,000 people
(20,000 families) in some 670 communities and 71 municipalities.21 Using the demand-driven
methodology common to all similar projects in the Northeast States, poor rural communities,
through their associations and participatory Municipal Development Councils (CONDEM),
would identify, implement, operate and maintain their subprojects, receiving appropriate training
and technical assistance/support. 22

2.3      The mix of investments could not be determined in advance given the demand-driven
nature of the Project but the percentage of productive, income-generating investments was
expected to increase markedly over the Phase I operation where they represented about one-third
of total investments to around 40-45%. The types of investments likely to be most commonly
demanded included: (i) economic infrastructure (e.g., water supply, electricity, sanitation, housing
improvements, community storage facilities and computer skills development); (ii) social
infrastructure (domestic sanitation, housing, health posts, child-care centers); (iii) productive
subprojects (improved agricultural activities, small-scale livestock raising, fish farming, honey,
and small-scale non-agricultural activities); and (iv) environmental subprojects (recovery of
degraded areas, contamination/pollution controls in reserve and spring areas, riparian forests,
areas of desertification, protection of areas of environmental value, income and employment
opportunities through sustainable use of natural resources).

2.4     Communities were entitled to 8% of total subproject cost for preparation and
implementation assistance. Costs of preparing subprojects were included in total subproject value
and could not exceed 3%. Technical assistance costs were limited to a maximum 5% of total
subproject cost. Communities using PRONESE’s standard subproject designs could access
PRONESE’s in-house technicians at no cost. Under the Operational Manual, the Municipal
Councils were entitled to 2% of the value of each subproject financed to defray operating costs,
and PRONESE was required to provide each Council with an annual indicative budget to guide
and discipline their planning and targeting processes. In an innovation not used under the Phase I

   As explained in the main text, the State always understood targeted beneficiary families to be 20,000 not the 25,000
shown in the PAD which they assert was an error. All Bank Aide Memoires use the lower figure and 100,000 persons
is the equivalent of 20,000 families using the Northeast rural average of five persons/family.

  The two main types of Municipal Councils (CONDEM and CMDRS) were unified and restructured in the first year
of project execution, bringing multiple public programs under one roof in a new entity/Council called the Municipal
Social Development Council (CMDS). According to the Final Evaluation, the majority maintained the 80/20 ratio of
community associations and civil society to public authorities established as the NE program standard for
representation; in some cases, parity was established.

Municipal Development Plan.

2.5       Results/outputs

      x   Project financed 547 subprojects (109% of target) benefiting 430 communities (without
          repetition) represented in 435 associations (without repetition) in 67 municipalities (of
          the 71 eligible).

      x   The vast majority of total subprojects were physically completed by project closing.
          This was possible, despite a high proportion of disbursement occurring in the final
          semester, because some 210 subprojects in this final period were water cisterns (147) and
          water distribution facilities (63) which are of simple design and rapidly-executed (see
          2.6-2.8). PRONESE teams are accompanying these newer subprojects to promote
          sustainability through good community operation and maintenance practices. The State
          Technical Assistance and Rural Extension Agency (EMDAGRO) is providing such
          services through an agreement with PRONESE (see copy of this agreement with
          Borrower Letter in Annex 7(B).

      x   Project promotion in the countryside resulted in massive demand for subprojects – some
          3,471 proposals covering 86 different types of investments were demanded and approved
          by the Councils in the first instance as being consistent with Municipal Development
          Plans.23

      x   Annual indicative budgets were not provided to the Municipal Councils, leading some to
          submit up to 60 subproject demands/intentions due to their lack of any idea of the amount
          of financing likely to be available in any one year.

      x   Of these, PRONESE accepted 715 for final analysis (about 21%) and actually financed
          545 (15.7%) through a process of filtering demand based on feasibility, appropriateness
          for local conditions and community capacity (see Table 2.5.1).

      x   By type of investment: 229 were basic infrastructure, 247 were productive, and 69 were
          social. There were no environmental subprojects.

      x   Targeting by priority Areas 1 and 2 was successful. Area 1 poorest families received 74%
          of total investments in subprojects (target 65%) and 74% of total subprojects.

      x   Ten quilombola communities - about 40% those formally-recognized by Fundacao
          Palmares, the benchmark for such recognition in Brazil - benefited from 18 investments,
          while the indigenous community of Xoko received two investments.

      x   Beneficiaries reported that while these subprojects almost universally improved quality of
          life and wellbeing, they did not affect families’ poverty status which – as beneficiaries
          themselves stated - requires multiple, integrated and intensive interventions.

  Demand represents the intention to formulate a subproject, subsequently established/not as a concrete proposal
approved by the Council and transmitted to PRONESE for analysis and possible financing.

    x    Various types of water supply were by far the most common infrastructure investments
         demanded and financed (cisterns, wells, simple water supply systems).

    x    Among both productive subprojects, tractors were the most commonly demanded and
         fishing equipment was the most commonly financed, in terms of financing vs. demand.

    x    Tractors represented 15.06% of total demand regardless of category.

    x    Productive demand represented 58.2% of total demand; social/environmental was
         23.62%; and infrastructure was only 18.18% of total demand.

    x    Average cost of all subprojects was just under US$41,000 and average number of
         beneficiaries per subproject was 40, although in 88% of subprojects financed, the number
         of beneficiaries ranged from 40 to 60.

    x    Average cost per family was US$1,009.00 and per beneficiary US$202.00.

    x    A quilombola housing improvement subproject of about US$97,000 was the highest cost
         and for 16 subprojects the value financed exceeded the US$50,000 limit.

    x    Average number of subprojects per municipality was 8.13 and per association 1.23.

2.6      Demand: Reduced infrastructure demand represented a sharp shift away from previous
projects not only in Sergipe but all other Northeast participating states, where demand for
infrastructure was usually dominant, and illustrates the major strides the region/Sergipe have
made in provision of basic infrastructure - especially water supply and electricity financed by the
Bank-supported CDD projects and Federal programs such as Million Cisterns, Luz para Todos -
in the past 15 years. Among Social/environmental investments, musical instrument subprojects
were the most commonly financed, but digital inclusion and housing subprojects were by far the
most commonly-demanded. Most notable is the vast disparity in the case of certain subprojects
between the numbers demanded and financed, and the apparent complete lack of financing of
environmental subprojects – an innovative new category of investment introduced by this project
– despite demand totaling 55 proposals. See Table 2.6.2.

2.7      Water subprojects: Water subprojects were just under 33% of all subprojects financed.
The Northeast region including Sergipe has suffered severe drought for the past two years. As a
result, water infrastructure has been prioritized in all semiarid/rural areas not only by the Bank-
supported CDD Projects, but through the combined resources of Municipal, State and Federal
Governments. In the letter case, such support has been delivered through the Agua Para Todos
program under the Brasil Sem Miséria umbrella. This level of support is similar to a concentrated
drive several years ago to achieve blanket energy coverage in this region under the Federal Luz
Para Todos program which also worked together with the CDD projects to universalize access to
electricity in rural areas. The Agua Para Todos program has the same strategy - to universalize
access        to       drinkable      water        in      the       NE        semiarid       zones.

2.8      In addition, for those already with access to an initial water cistern for human
consumption, the program is financing a second cistern to enable the development of basic
productive activities to achieve food security for poor families in rural and peri-urban areas. Such
cisterns are of simple design and rapid execution, with communities learning how to construct
and maintain them, and use them as a reserve even during the drought period. Municipal water
trucks ("carros-pipa") fill the cisterns, providing beneficiaries with clean, drinkable water closer
to their homes.

2.9      Therefore, the main justification for financing water cisterns and simplified water
systems is to provide access to drinkable water for poor rural families, saving them the tome and
labor of carrying water long distances in semiarid conditions because there are no alternative
sources.

2.10     Targeting: About 74% of investment financing was used in Area 1 - exceeding the
targeted 65% - and 26% was used in Area 2. Investments in Area 1 were mainly productive and
in Area 2, mainly infrastructure. Average cost of subprojects was about US$41,000, and very
similar in Area 2.

2.11    Women’s participation: At appraisal, some 42% of all households in Sergipe were
female-headed, the highest rate among all the Northeast states and one of the highest nationally.
Some 32% of all rural households were female-led. Such households were among the very
poorest in the State with 74% of all such families in rural areas having earned one minimum wage
or less in 2000 (data available at appraisal). PRONESE assigned high priority to vulnerable
groups, especially to female-headed households and female-led associations, as indicated below:

    x    11,042 of the total 21,966 families benefited were female-headed (50.27%).

    x    30.36% of productive subprojects (87% of target) were led – demanded, executed and
         operated - by women.

    x    Female-led associations accounted for 30.3% of all subprojects (86.6% of target), and
         50.27% of total beneficiary households were female-headed.

    x    As is typical, participation of female-headed households was higher in social subprojects.

         of leadership in monitoring/other committees.

         women in the Executive Committee.

2.12    Quilombola and Xoco communities: The Project’s performance was significantly better
under Phase II with ethnic/indigenous populations due to PRONESE’s proactive efforts to explain
the Project in culturally-appropriate ways and encourage the Councils to give such communities
top priority. Results are as follows:

     x   10 quilombola communities (without repetition) represented by 11 associations received
         18 subprojects totaling about US$726,000, mostly fishing equipment, cisterns, cultural
         activities, digital inclusion, beekeeping, and housing. While characterized as
         “infrastructure? investments in most cases, they also had a strong social component due
         to the extreme vulnerability and isolation of these communities with little/no access to
         basic infrastructure - especially water - in semi-arid conditions.24

     x   The quilombola housing improvement subproject was the Project’s most expensive at
         over US$97,000.

     x   The Xoco community received two subprojects via two associations: embroidered crafts
         and fishing equipment.

2.13     Productive subprojects: The Project financed 247 productive subprojects - about 12%
of total demands received from communities for this type and 45.3% of all subprojects actually
financed - benefiting over 10,800 families and increasing the assets they now hold.25 As a result:

     x   Incomes increased in value terms for all sampled subprojects but the percentage increase
         is not known due to lack of a Baseline for comparison.

     x   Analysis of 12 major types of investments showed, in value terms: (i) incomes of 1,175
         families with productive subprojects increased an average R$2,033/family in the year
         post-investment; and (ii) incomes of 399 families with infrastructure subprojects
         increased an average R$704/family in the year post-investment
.
     x   Two quilombola associations benefited from fishing equipment investments resulting in
         incomes increasing by R$1,617 (equipment only) and R$7,475 (equipment and boats).
         Income information is not available for the one Xoco indigenous group benefited.

     x   Analysis shows that 54% of sampled subprojects are generating robust economic results
         respectively, with positive outlook for income potential. On the other hand, 46% to 32%
         are generating marginal or negative economic returns depending on the assumptions
         made about future development of mechanization services.




24
  At appraisal, 18 quilombola communities were officially recognized by the Palmares Foundation. By project closing,
25 had achieved recognition.

discussion of relative results.

    x   Capital assets increased in value terms by US$990 per family based on average total
        investment of families with productive investments (Annex 3, Tables 1-6 and Box).

    x   Household assets (defined as non-productive assets, e.g., water cisterns), increased on
        average $1,474 for families benefited by such cisterns (Annex 3, Tables 1-6 and Box).

2.14    Commercialization: The PAD provided a roadmap for organized marketing activities
while strong community demand and State policy support showed that the timing was right, but
achievement was negligible. The project target for productive beneficiaries with commercial
contracts was unrealistically high and did not take into account inter alia, the need to differentiate.
This meant PRONESE scrutinizing and filtering demand more critically, analyzing the viability
of both the subproject and the proposing association and separating out subprojects of a simple,
easily-managed type more suited to less formal local marketing arrangements, from the likely
much smaller number of ventures with serious commercial potential. It also required greater
proactivity from PRONESE in establishing partnerships with specialist agencies to leverage the
technical support and networks contemplated at appraisal. PRONESE intensified efforts in the
final months including field verification of productive subprojects and partnerships with
SEBRAE and EMDAGRO but these efforts came too late to have effect, at least within the
Project. It is known that about 30% of all households with project-supported productive
subprojects are marketing their products locally under various arrangements, as suggested by the
income results, but no strategy or organized campaigns were developed to facilitate or monitor
this process. There was some modest progress in the final year when PRONESE established
partnerships to develop a marketing strategy but such efforts came late in the project period.

2.15    This experience inevitably raises the question whether CDD is an appropriate vehicle for
organized marketing, value chain development/other, but there are by now many documented
examples in the Northeast states of successful small farmer marketing ventures - including to
European supermarket chains and to the national school lunch program - in cashew nut, dairy
products, fruits, crafts and other products, to largely dismiss doubt but organized efforts require
technical specialists, network development, political support and exceptionally careful selection
and analysis of products and of farmer groups.

2.16    Component 2: Institutional Strengthening (US$1.4 million or 5% of total project cost)
executed by PRONESE, financed (i) technical assistance and training to support mobilization and
strengthening of CAs to identify, prepare, implement, operate and maintain subprojects; (ii)
capacity-building for Municipal Councils (MC) to manage their responsibilities as defined in the
Operational Manual, including the assessment and supervision of the CAs, participatory planning,
financial management of community investments and environmental management of small
community subprojects, and dissemination campaigns; (iii) workshops and seminars for MC and
CA to exchange experiences, and to explain and facilitate integration of/with other State and
Federal poverty reduction programs.

2.17     Training activities were also designed to enhance and support: (i) planning and
information systems including special studies on productive/value chains, internal control and
evaluation of PRONESE’s performance; (ii) professional development for beneficiaries of
productive subprojects in collaboration with SENAI, SENAC, SENAR and SEBRAE, as well as
institutional partnerships; (iii) skills-building course for PRONESE staff and technicians
including in environmental management; (iv) information management and communications
equipment; (v) maintenance and upgrading of the MIS; and (v) training supporting preparation of
special/evaluation studies.

2.18    Results/Outputs:

    x   100% of Municipal Councils received training in some/all of the subjects planned:
        participatory planning, the Operational Manual, procurement, financial management,
        integration, productive investments and Bank Safeguards.

    x   All community associations entering the Project received organizational and/or
        subproject-related training but of inconsistent quality, quantity and geographic reach.

    x   A high proportion of PRONESE staff participated in workshops and training courses over
        the course of the Project, in subjects related directly to project implementation.

    x   The targeted 80% of productive subprojects with “regular? access to technical assistance
        services was not achieved. About 23% of beneficiaries received some kind of regular TA
        services. Technical assistance, like training, was of inconsistent supply and quality and
        few beneficiaries had regular access. Efforts by the MTR and by PRONESE subsequently
        to re-structure the strategy, availability, content and delivery of TA/training were
        frustrated by lack of time and institutional disruption. Most TA provided by EMDAGRO
        (the State extension service) was focused on livestock subprojects (goats and sheep).
        COHIDRO (Sergipe Water Resources and Irrigation Development Company), provided
        services for beneficiaries settled on irrigation perimeters, while INCRA (National
        Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform) and the MST (Landless Workers’
        Movement) provided services to project beneficiaries located in formally recognized land
        reform settlements.

    x   About 50% of eligible quilombola communities were represented in their Municipal
        Council vs. the 75% planned.

    x   Interviews with associations and Council members suggest that the Councils were active
        forums for accessing a range of public programs and 38.4% said they had
        sought/obtained new financing from other programs (e.g., PRONAF, SEBRAE, Bank of
        Northeast Brazil and CODEVASF) after their subproject (see below and Annex 5).

    x   The MIS was maintained by an in-house team and periodically upgraded.

2.19    Cross-sector integration and resource leveraging: As described in the Main Text,
Section 3.2, the Project sought to strengthen cross-sector integration of rural investments through
training in participatory planning and monitoring at the local, municipal and state levels. The
expected outcome of this training inter alia, was to demonstrate that cross-sector integration could
leverage at least US$5.00 of additional, complementary resources from other programs for each
US$1.00 of project investment funds. Table 2.15.1 below shows that complementary resources
were leveraged in a ratio exceeding 6:1.

2.20    The leveraging of these resources occurred through two strategies or channels:

    x   SEAGRI: Meetings brought State Government Secretariats together at senior levels and
        especially between SEAGRI and its three relevant agencies: PRONESE, EMDAGRO and
        COHIDRO. The State Council for Sustainable Rural Development then
        discussed/approved the policies and instruments to disseminate and integrate activities
        and resources (between programs and projects) in the field.
    x   Municipal Councils: Almost all (62 of 71) Councils were unified and restructured
        through a Municipal Law which allows them to access, discuss and work with several
        policies, programs and projects’ activities and resources from the Federal, State and
        Municipal Governments. The Councils also monitor and check results.

2.21     The main programs, policies and projects from which resources are leveraged have a
direct linkage with the family agriculture population targeted by the Project and efforts are made
to keep these potential beneficiaries informed and included. PRONESE follows up on how these
resources are allocated and transferred to those populations through its five field teams
comprising 15 rural technicians (agricultural specialists, civil engineers, social and environmental
specialists) who provide TA, monitoring of subproject execution and participate in the Municipal
Council meetings. Leveraged resources do not directly “intersect? with Project resources but may
do indirectly, because the resources are not disbursed on a pari passu basis. However, the
investments could be combined, e.g., the Project financed productive investments in Serra da
Guia community in the Municipality of Porto da Folho, and the Minha Casa-Minha Vida (My
House-My Life) housing program financed housing for the same community/families as a result
of PRONESE bringing the programs together (Project and housing) based on community need.

Social Capital Formation

2.22    A Key Indicator called for the re-measurement of a Social Capital Index (SCI) developed
in 2000 for the Van Zyl study (World Bank, 2000) of the Northeast Brazil CDD program but
appropriate data consistent with the variables used by the SCI was not collected by the Project.
The ICR therefore uses proxy information (Binswanger et al, 2009), and survey responses from
beneficiaries and other key stakeholders (community associations, civil society, and Municipal
Council members) to support claims that the Project is likely to have had considerable impact on
social capital. The Binswanger study was a pioneering effort to use econometric methods for
quantitative analysis of changes in the level of social capital in communities and municipalities.
The analysis also used different methods to control for effects external to the projects.

2.23   Binswanger et al. interviewed municipal, community and household subjects to assess the
Northeast Brazil CDD projects’ social capital formation capacity with the following results:

Associations:

    x   Results ranging from 83% to as high as 98% were obtained for indicators such as the
        growth in institutional capacity of community associations since 2002, sustainability of
        community subprojects, and better results than purely "supply-driven" development, at
        lower cost.


                                                36
    x   Stakeholders interviewed pointed to the sustainability of most community subprojects
        and strong social impact on strengthening community associations, improving quality of
        life, and increasing rural family income.

    x   Levels of community participation in associations, collective decision-making and
        collective activities had grown. Community associations (and Municipal Councils) were
        viewed as inclusive, participatory and democratic institutions where decisions were made
        by the majority.

    x   Associations' institutional capacity to represent the community and resolve its problems
        was rated highly, and the associations were seen as influential in community life, and
        selected democratically (91% of respondents).

    x   Importantly, associations' growing strength and role in the Municipal Councils had
        markedly changed relations between rural communities and State authorities as measured
        by the rise in municipal authorities' responsiveness to community demands.

    x   Households surveyed expressed respect for their association which was linked among
        most interviewed with a growth in trust, solidarity, cooperation and participation in
        collective activities.

    x   At the household level, levels of formal and genuine participation of beneficiaries in
        identifying local priorities and selecting the appropriate community action were high.
        Consistent with this, rates of satisfaction with the actual demand of respective
        communities and the actual investment implemented were equally high.

    x   Ratings above 80% were recorded for items such as associations' capacity to bring in
        subprojects that benefit the community and represent community's interests, thereby
        promoting collaboration between communities, strengthening ties of friendship between
        residents, and sustained participation in the meetings to select investments.

2.24     In summary, Binswanger et al. (2009) viewed the scale of measured changes in social
capital as signaling a process of intensive growth in the stock of social capital and that the
Northeast projects have had a massive influence on this. After implementation of subprojects,
social capital continued to grow but at a slower pace. The effects of setting the process in motion
were long-lasting. The projects' influence has been through the use of new, specific forms of
institutional arrangements to help communities become more active, to engage them in inter-
community collaboration networks, and to transform their relations with the State from
dependency                                       to                                     partnership.

Municipalities:

2.25    Results were as follows:

    x   In 79% of municipalities, based on interviews with members of Municipal Councils, it
        was felt that organization of communities had had positive effects on municipal
        administration and in 81% it was believed that establishing the Councils had had the
        same effect.



                                                37
    x   Even so, the use of the Councils as channels for providing information on the actions of
        the municipal administration had not grown and remained around 12%.

    x   While a significant portion of Councils had become forums for discussing public policy
        and other issues of community interest, most deliberation was restricted to the project
        itself and PRONAF. In 35%, 36% and 45% of municipalities respectively, Councils
        discuss other federal, state and municipal programs. But in only 28%, 20% and 28%
        respectively, are Councils forums for deliberation on those programs and their resources.

    x   The conclusion was that the Councils were still evolving as instruments for implementing
        public policy and public accounting. However, the Councils have had a critical role in
        representing poor rural communities traditionally excluded from established channels for
        political representation.

2.26    All results indicate, with statistical significance and a high degree of confidence, that the
Northeast projects have had a strong impact on social capital formation, derived from the creation
of associations and execution of subprojects.

2.27     A second source of substantiation is the Borrower’s Final Evaluation
(PRONESE/SEAGRI 2012) which surveyed beneficiaries, community associations, Council
members and civil society stakeholders on issues related to social capital. From the perspective
of the beneficiaries (324 individual interviews were conducted with beneficiary community
organizations and communities), community organization emerges as one of the three major
results of the Project (the other two are: improved quality of life and poverty relief). For these key
stakeholders, the project`s impact on community participation (i.e., the core “bonding? dimension
of social capital) is evidenced by:

    x   contribution to creating, regularizing and promoting the sustainability of thousands of
        poor rural community associations (some 2,291 associations are registered in PRONESE
        cadaster meaning they are fully active);

    x   ability to promote popular engagement and participation in subprojects` implementation
        (81% of the interviewees pointed out this participation), operation and maintenance (but
        just 42% of the interviewees pointed out this dimension);

    x   contribution to increasing the participation of women and youth in the life and activities
        of community organizations; and,

    x   contribution to popular engagement and participation, at the local level, in other
        community problem-solving activities, which are closely related with participation in
        community organizations;

    x   shortcomings were also identified in matters related to public dissemination and
        transparency in rendering accounts of subprojects due to both inadequate tools to present
        them and the low level of formal education of the majority of the beneficiaries.

2.28     This Final Evaluation also took into account the opinions of community, civil society and
municipal representatives in the participatory Municipal Councils representing 33 municipalities
from seven out of the eight territories in the State of Sergipe. Their opinions addressed social
capital issues related to: (i) increasing the cooperative ties between poor rural communities and
promoting a territorial view of sustainable development (i.e., the core “linking? dimension of

                                                 38
social capital) and (ii) promoting mediation between these communities and municipal and state
agencies and authorities as well as the participation of community representatives in policy
decision-making processes (i.e., the third core “bridging? dimension of social capital).

2.29    Thus, the report shows that, from their point of view, participatory Municipal Councils
have fully-constituted arenas able to democratize the access of poor rural population to
information, to include the voice of the poor in the formation of public policies that affect them,
and to promote social control over the implementation of these policies. All people interviewed
agreed these Municipal Councils work in a participatory way and their decisions are collective
and democratically taken. Additionally, the process of unification of Municipal Councils
promoted by the Project has, in their view, positively contributed to increasing access to
information on different public policies, increased the number of thematic areas debated at
Council meetings, made it possible to improve synergies between different public interventions,
made available a larger network of technical assistance agencies, and opened access to other
sources of funding (PRONAF, CONAB, PNAE) for community associations. Finally, the report
shows that a major shortcoming in the operation of these Municipal Councils refers to their
continued financial and logistical dependence upon municipal resources due to the lack of
contributions form community associations to their maintenance.

2.30     Component 3: Horizontal Integration (US$0.9 million, about 3% of total project cost)
financed planned technical assistance, consultants, software, and systems installation for the State
Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN) to strengthen its results-based management capacity to
improve planning, integration, monitoring and evaluation of public policies and investments for
poverty reduction; improve the alignment of public expenditures with the State’s development
priorities as outlined in its PPA (2008-2011) and to support modernization of the State public
administration.

2.31     Planned activities were the following: (i) SEPLAN was to establish an internal MIS/SIG
(Geographic Reference Information System) to support Results-based Management; (ii) two
evaluations of public policies were to be conducted as the outcome of receiving project-supported
capacity-building; (iii) SEPLAN middle-level managers and technical staff were to receive
training in Results-based Management, i.e., to construct databases to monitor and evaluate public
policies, and training in the integration of these policies; and (iv) consultants were to install a cost
system for the public budget.

2.32    Results/Outputs:

    x   This component was ambitious and not well-mapped out at appraisal. Certain activities
        such as establishing an internal MIS (called SIG by the State) for data-based planning and
        administration of public policy, and training for middle managers/technicians were
        conducted but other activities such as SEPLAN’s preparation of two evaluations of
        selected public policies and investments for poverty reduction were not done. The MIS
        activities were self-financed (not by the Project).

    x   The Project trained 10 SEPLAN middle managers and technical personnel in results-
        based management. These courses were financed under Component 2 (not 3). SEPLAN
        and PRONESE teams participated in fiduciary, safeguards and impact evaluation training
        provided by Bank specialists, as well as courses conducted over a 6-month period for
        preparation of the Project Operational Strategic Framework and to support team capacity
        building in results-based management and results evaluation.


                                                  39
    x    Using resources from the IDB-financed Federal national Program for Management
         Support to States (PNAGE), 11 public officers (10 SEPLAN and one PRONESE) did
         post-graduate courses in Public Planning, Budgeting and Management at Tiradentes
         University (UNIT), courses designed and monitored by SEPLAN.

    x    Borrower ownership of Component 3 was weak – other Northeast states with similar
         components in their CDD operations have shown similar lack of ownership caused by
         reluctance to use project funds for such activities.

2.33     Component 4: Project Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation
(US$0.6 million, about 2% of total project cost) financed the operational costs, excluding salaries,
of project administration/coordination, supervision, monitoring, and impact evaluation.
Evaluation studies were to include: annual physical performance reviews to assess subproject
quality and sustainability and including reviews of community-based procurement; case studies to
assess project economic impact; beneficiary survey-based Physical Performance Study at Mid-
term; and comprehensive impact evaluation with control groups and comprising a baseline
following Effectiveness and follow-up at project completion.

2.34     Results/Outputs:

    x    The costs of this component escalated, requiring the reallocation of some US$600,000 in
         2011 to cover operational and administrative expenses associated with PRONESE’s
         centralized location and need to traverse the State to reach communities.28

    x    PRONESE conducted a Mid-term Evaluation, a Final Evaluation, and a Borrower
         Completion Report (the latter delivered after finalization of the ICR) all three of which
         were discussed with the Bank. The Final Evaluation includes case studies and surveys of
         beneficiary and Council opinions on various project-related subjects. The evaluation did
         not have access to baseline data, and did not use comparators/control groups.

    x    TORs were prepared for the planned Physical Performance Study and Baseline Study but
         the studies were not done. PRONESE prepared TORs and methodology under the
         guidance of Bank M&E specialists. Although PRONESE had received the Bank no
         objection, a Bank mission in April 2010 decided to change the design and methodology
         for the Baseline Study. A consultant was contracted to re-design the methodology, select
         the sample and prepare questionnaires. All documents were prepared and sent to the Bank
         in early 2011 due to management issues with the State Government and pending elections,
         but for unexplained reasons, the Bank did not respond. Also, due to the Borrower’s
         request to change the targeted subprojects, the sample size defined was bigger than the
         total subproject target (500, reduced from 1,000). As the Project timeline was by then
         well-advanced, and the institutional situation at the State level quite confused with many
         changes, PRONERSE decided not to proceed with the Baseline Study.




28
   It is worth noting that PRONESE’s resistance to establishing regional offices was justified on the grounds that
distances between the capital and rest of the State were relatively short – Sergipe is Brazil’s smallest state in area.


                                                         40
x   The Physical Performance Study (PPS) was not prepared. PRONESE and the SEPLAN
    M&E specialist, based on outlines and TORs provided by the Bank, designed the
    methodology, prepared questionnaires and conducted field research, sending a
    preliminary synthesis to the MTR mission. The MTR mission used this as a reference but
    the planned full study was not prepared.

x   The Project MIS was upgraded and its functionality and content periodically reviewed.

x   PRONESE conducted a minimum three visits and up to five to each subproject: (i) a
    visita previa (prior visit) to assess the legitimacy of subproject demand; (ii) technical
    analysis to assess subproject feasibility; (iii) 1st supervision visit after signing the
    agreement with the beneficiary association, to provide guidance and check if the
    association had all required information to conduct procurement and initiate subproject
    execution; (iv) 2nd supervision visit depending on subproject complexity and the phases
    of subproject execution; and (v) final approval of the completed subproject. All visits
    were accompanied by NTGA technicians (social and environmental), as well as by the
    Municipal Council representative.

x   Compliance with the Operational Manual was general satisfactory with exception of the
    requirements that (i) each Municipal Council be informed of an annual indicative budget
    to guide planning and targeting, and (ii) that 2% of the value of each approved subproject
    be transferred to the Councils to help them defray operating costs.

x   Compliance with Safeguards and Anti-corruption policies was generally satisfactory with
    the exception of provisions relating to transferring a portion of the cost of every
    subproject to the Council to defray operating expenses, and the requirement that the
    Councils be notified of an indicative budget each year to guide planning and priority-
    setting for subprojects.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

3.1      During project appraisal, a financial analysis was conducted on 12 typical subproject
investments for production support, carried out during Phase I. Likewise, an economic analysis
was undertaken with five subproject investments, both for production support and community
infrastructure, representative of the most common investment categories financed by Phase I. For
the final evaluation (SEAGRI/PRONESE 2012), 37 subproject investments were randomly
selected for assessment of financial and economic results - these included 23 productive
investment subprojects, 12 community infrastructure subprojects and 2 socio-cultural subprojects.
The sample was obtained from a list of 87 subprojects executed and with at least one year of
operation; annual benefits and costs were assessed on the year of evaluation. The assessment of
financial and economic results is an ex-post assessment which considers only the first or second
year of operation of the implemented subproject.

3.2      Subproject categories in the selection universe are properly represented in the sample.
There are similar proportions among the three major investment categories, namely: production
support (62%); community infrastructure (32%); and socio-cultural inclusion (5%). Likewise,
there is proportional representation among the most common subproject types, namely: (i) among
production support investments - fishing equipment (8%), cattle and goat production support
(8%), agricultural mechanisation (46%); and (ii) among community infrastructure and socio-
cultural investments - drinking water infrastructure (20%), road infrastructure (14%) and
musical/digital facilities for youth (6%). The selected subprojects were assessed through group
workshops and individual working sessions conducted within an evaluation consultancy. Due to
the relatively small selection universe of subprojects, the financial and economic results obtained
from this analysis provide unbiased estimates of feasibility at the aggregate level, but not at the
territorial level or any other subdivision.

3.3     Assumptions: During appraisal, financial NPV and IRR were calculated for twelve
typical production support subprojects. In turn, only economic IRR were calculated for the five
most common subproject investments. Analytical parameters essentially included a 10 per cent
annual discount rate and a 14-year evaluation period. The cost-benefit analysis performed for this
ICR uses the information gathered through the above-mentioned evaluation consultancy, and the
same analytical parameters used at appraisal. For the financial analysis, family labour was not
included since it does not represent a cash expenditure. For the economic analysis, family labour
was included and valued at market wages. The economic price of labour was assumed to be equal
to the financial or market price, since the unemployment rate in recent years was reported at
around 5%, considered by Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE) as a
voluntary/mobility-based unemployment (or full-employment rate). For subproject investments
with an average economic life greater that the evaluation period (14 years), a residual value was
calculated. Fiscal impact was not assessed since the great majority of beneficiary families would
be exempt from the ICMS (value added tax) under the legislation of the State of Sergipe.

Economic Analysis

3.4      Table 1 provides a brief description of analysed subprojects and assessed economic
results. Table 2 converts values reported in the previous table to average figures per beneficiary
family. Table 3 presents the projected annual flows of economic net benefits of assessed
subprojects. In general, net benefits assessed during evaluation workshops were linearly projected
over 14 years. When the average investment life was lower than 14 years, the net benefit annual
flows were limited by such estimated average investment life. In the case of agricultural
mechanization subprojects - tractors and agricultural equipment - assessed net benefits were not

                                                42
linearly-projected, since: (i) the State of Sergipe was affected by drought during the assessment
year; and (ii) the high level of unsatisfied demand for agricultural mechanization is likely to
diminish in coming years as more tractors are available in the region. The benefits of investing in
farm mechanization are particularly high in dry years, when comparing the with- and without-
project situation, since tractor services need to be opportune to take advantage of scarce rain.
Based on the above, a conservative scenario was defined, where the assessed net benefits of Year
one are reduced to 50% in Year two, to 25% in Year three, and disappear in Year four. This
scenario suggests that in 4 years, mechanization services could be rented as/when needed by
farmers without their own tractor and equipment. This assumption was made because investments
in tractors are very profitable even for private investors who rent tractor services. Therefore it is
expected that private services for rented tractors will increase in the coming years reducing the
benefits of owning a tractor which is generally used below its full capacity. If we relax this
assumption, and we extrapolate benefits assessed in the year of evaluation for the rest of the 14-
year evaluation period. The number of mechanization subprojects with NPV is reduced from
eight to three, and therefore the overall percentage of subprojects with marginal returns will
decrease from: 46% to 32% for the economic analysis; and from 56% to 35% for the financial
analysis. This scenario reflects the likely development of private services for rented tractors in
the coming year, since a highly profitable activity will attract private investors thereby reducing
the benefits of owning a tractor which are generally used below their full capacity.

3.5      Benefits: In broad terms, the benefits estimated for the various subprojects are as
follows: (i) for milking equipment, reduction of labour costs; (ii) for improved goat herds,
increased milk production; (iii) for the ice-making facility, reduction of input costs and time-
savings of fishermen; (iv) for tractors and equipment, improved crop productivity due to better
timing of main agricultural tasks to coincide with the rainy period, and reduction of input costs;
(v) for road infrastructure (fords), reduction of production losses (e.g., milk) due to precarious
transportation conditions of existing dirt roads during the rainy season; (vi) for drinking water
infrastructure, reduction of family time to procure water and municipal costs associated with
operating water tanker trucks. Benefits from musical instruments were qualitatively identified but
the information obtained did not allow for a value assessment. Benefits for digital facilities were
not valued since the subproject was not found in operation. Other benefits were also identified
but not quantified such as: improved hygiene and safety associated with milking equipment; and,
reduced costs of transportation of those producer associations with tractors. Other benefits could
have been generated which were not valued. Thus, the estimated economic and financial IRR
should be interpreted as minimum returns.

3.6      As shown in Table 1, the economic NPV and IRR of the 37 subprojects assessed were
US$1,136,500 and 30% respectively - an average NPV of US$30,700 per subproject. The
aggregate total investment cost was US$1,595,100 of which 81% was funded by the Project and
19% was provided by beneficiary groups as their counterpart contribution. The average economic
life of executed investments was 12 years. As shown in Table 2, average figures per beneficiary
family were: US$680 as the economic NPV; US$730 as the incremental net benefit in the
assessed year; a reduction of 5 person-days as the incremental annual labour use; and US$750 as
the total investment cost.

3.7      Considering that the project channelled US$22.1 million to subproject investments
involving 21,970 families, and US$4.6 million to other activities, investment cost per beneficiary
family is on average US$1,010 - 35% higher than the average investment of assessed subprojects
in the sample. While maintaining the same IRR, the NPV could be adjusted by that proportion to
US$920 per beneficiary family. Now, if other project costs are taken into account (US$210 per
family): the overall economic IRR of the project would be 22%; the economic NPV per family

                                                 43
would be US$660; and the aggregate economic NPV for the project (with 21,970 beneficiary
families) would be US$14.5 million (higher than the partial estimate at appraisal). On the other
hand, 12-17 of the 37 subprojects showed an IRR below 10% and thus negative NPV. This
implies that 46-32% of subprojects are generating marginal or negative economic returns,
depending on assumptions of reduced benefits from tractors associated with the development of a
rental market for agricultural machinery.

3.8     While recognizing that the analysis does not offer economic indicators for the different
subproject types, with statistical confidence, the assessed economic IRR: (i) for goat production
improvements and fishing equipment were negative (not estimated at appraisal); (ii) for
agricultural mechanization was 39% (higher than estimated at appraisal), ranging from negative
to over 200%; (iii) for drinking water infrastructure was 46% (slightly lower than estimated at
appraisal), ranging from 33% to 87%; and, (iv) for road infrastructure was 21% (not estimated at
appraisal), ranging from negative to 48%.

Financial Analysis

3.9     Table 4 includes the investment subprojects for production support which were assessed
in terms of financial results for beneficiary groups. Table 5 converts values reported in the
previous table to average figures per beneficiary family. Table 6 presents the projected annual
flows of financial net benefits of assessed subprojects. In essence, the subprojects included in the
financial analysis are a subset of the 37 subprojects included in the financial analysis, namely:
milking equipment; goat production support; ice production; fishing equipment; and, agricultural
mechanisation.

3.10     As shown in Table 4, the financial NPV and IRR of the 23 subprojects assessed were
US$707,400 and 39% respectively - an average NPV of US$30,760 per subproject. The aggregate
total investment cost was US$1,133,700 of which 74% was funded by the Project and 26% was
provided by beneficiary groups as their counterpart contribution. The average economic life of
executed investments was 11 years. As shown in Table 5, average figures per beneficiary family
were: US$620 as the economic NPV; US$810 as the incremental net benefit in the assessed year;
a reduction of 4 person-days as the incremental annual labour use; and, US$990 as the total
investment cost.

3.11    Considering that the project channelled US$10.0 million to production support
subprojects involving 10,800 families, the investment cost per beneficiary family was on average
US$920 - 7% lower than the average investment of assessed subprojects in the sample. While
maintaining the same IRR, the NPV could be adjusted by that proportion to US$570 per
beneficiary family. In summary, the overall financial IRR would be 39%; and the aggregate
financial NPV for productive subprojects (with 10,800 beneficiary families) would be
US$6.2 million. On the other hand, 8-13 of the 23 subprojects showed an IRR below 10% and
thus a negative NPV. This implies that 56-35% of subprojects are generating marginal or
negative financial returns, depending on assumptions of reduced benefits from tractors
associated with the development of a rental market for agricultural machinery.

3.12     While recognizing that financial indicators for subproject types are not statistically
representative, the assessed financial IRR: (i) for goat production improvements was negative; (ii)
for fishing equipment was over 100%, representing a significant income increase for beneficiary
fishermen, to the detriment of existing boat owners, who previously shared fishing gains with
beneficiaries; and, (iii) for agricultural mechanization was 32% (slightly lower than estimate at
appraisal), ranging from negative to over 200%.

Sensitivity Analysis

3.13     To assess the sensitivity of economic and financial projections of subproject results,
various scenarios of reduced benefits were analyzed. As shown in Table 7, the project economic
benefits, from increased production and labor cost reduction of families, could be reduced to 50%
and still generate an average subproject IRR of 23%. The proportion of subprojects with low
economic IRR (less than 10%) would increase from 41% to 49%. Now, when the projected
financial benefits from increased production of families, are reduced to 50% the average
subproject IRR is reduced to 10% – changes in labor costs do not alter the financial IRR since
they are not cash flows. The proportion of subprojects with low financial IRR would increase
from 46% to 54% while the proportion of productive subprojects with low financial IRR would
increase from 49% to 56%. It can be concluded that total projected benefits can be significantly
less and still be above the opportunity cost, due to the robust economic and financial results of
54-51% of subprojects.

3.14    The PDO sought an increase in capital assets as a result of investments in productive
subprojects, while the Key Indicator called for an increase in household assets. Box 3.1 discusses
the possible definition of capital versus household and calculates assets in each case using project
data from Tables 1-6 below.

Box 3.14.1: Value of Capital vs. Household Assets
    If capital assets are assets for productive activities, as implicitly stated in the PDO, it is possible to report
    an increase in value terms (but not in percentage terms due to lack of baseline data), of capital assets per
    family using the average total investment reported in Table 5 below for families benefited from
    productive subprojects which is US$990/family. The value of those investments on productive
    subprojects/capital assets can also be recalculated considering all families in all subprojects (including
    productive and social infrastructure subprojects). This results in a value of US$678/family.

    If household assets are only those aimed at satisfying basic needs (i.e., drinking water) and indirectly
    productive activities (rural roads), Tables 1 and 2 below provide information to generate an average total
    investment per beneficiary family. The average investment (or value of increased household assets) of
    families benefited only from these non-productive subprojects is US$874/family. But, as proposed above
    for capital assets, the investments in non-productive subprojects (defined as household assets) are re-
    calculated, and considering all families in all subprojects, the resulting value is US$276/family.

                                                          45
The issue with the above is that the value of rural roads cannot be shown as a household asset but rather as
a community or public asset (as for water cistern, musical instruments, and equipment for a digital
inclusion center). Only cisterns are easily understood as household assets and thus data shows that the
average investment in cisterns was US$1,474/family among families benefited by cisterns, or
US$162/family for all families in the assessed sample.

Another interpretation is to state that household assets include investment in productive activities and
basic needs. In this case, the average per family investment is the one shown in Table 2 below which is
US$953/family. This does not remove the issue of defining/interpreting what household assets are. Like
roads, tractors cannot easily be pictured as household assets since they belong to a group of producers. In
the universe of productive subprojects only those for milking equipment, goat herd improvements and
fishing van be seen as direct farm/household improvements and on this basis data show that the average
investment of only farm/household productive subprojects is US$1,862/family among families benefited
by such investments or US$178/family for all the families in the assessed sample.

If farm/household productive investments and cisterns (assets easily portrayed as household assets both
productive and non-productive) are added, the average investment per family is US$1,654 among families
benefited by such investments or US$340/family for all families in the assessed sample. In terms of the
increase in value of community assets, the average investment of only group productive and social
infrastructure investments is US$849/family among families benefited by such investments or
US$500/family for all families in the assessed sample.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

5.1     The Final Evaluation (2012) conducted structured interviews with 224 community
association members and leaders (summarized below), as well as with Municipal Council
members representing 33 Councils in seven of the eight State territories. The interviews did not
address specific questions to women, youth, quilombola or indigenous groups which the ICR
considers a missed opportunity.

5.3       Origins of and types of subprojects:

      x   57% of association members knew about the Bank-supported Project specifically, but
          40.2% did not, i.e., did not know where their subproject came from;
      x   Among those who were aware, the Project meant, in order of significance, improved
          quality of life, the financing of small community projects, poverty reduction, and
          organization of their community;
      x   Among the types of subprojects best-known were: tractors/equipment; cisterns; boats and
          nets; acquisition of breeding animals; water supply; small bridges; and housing
          improvements. These were in fact, among the most commonly-financed by the Project;

5.4       Factors for access to the Project:

      x   63.8% said any community or association was eligible to access the Project stating: “it’s
          the only way anything reaches the poor?; “PRONESE came to all communities to help?;
      x   Despite the understanding that the Project was accessible by all communities,
          interviewees also knew that access depended on level of interest and organization of the
          community/association, capacity to achieve/comply with project requirements, i.e., the
          conditions for access especially the existence of an association, registration with
          PRONESE, regular fiscal status, identification of a legitimate/viable subproject, and
          capacity to prepare a subproject;
      x   15.5% saw lack of organization, lack of energy to push for the subproject as negative
          factors, and that only those “in partnership with the Mayor? would be attended;

5.5       Registration of associations with PRONESE:

      x   The process of registration and re-registration with PRONESE was viewed as a good
          thing by 35.3% and a negative factor by 6.7% due to the bureaucracy and large amount of
          documentation required for regularization;
      x   Some 56.3% were unaware of this as an issue (even though it involved a high proportion
          of associations at project outset and delayed implementation for several years);

5.6       Project’s capacity to attend to community needs:

      x   78.6% of interviewees stated that their subprojects generated opportunities for productive
          activities and income (breeding animals, small agro-processing, dairying, ice-making);
          acquisition of goods essential to improve quality of life (all types of water supply
          facilities); means of production (tractors, fishing equipment); access to information
          (digital inclusion investments); better infrastructure (bridges and fords); socio-cultural
          activities designed to restore cultural heritage (musical instrument investments for youth,
          cultural activities for quilombolas);


                                                 58
      x   However, 5.4% stated that subprojects reached only part of their community, i.e., were
          under-dimensioned, and that certain investments were unsuitable, e.g., acquisition of
          sheep for communities with no land;

5.7       Existence of other programs:

      x   40.6% cited a wide range of other public programs active in their
          municipality/community the most commonly-mentioned being: PRONAF; Bolsa
          Familia; Food Acquisition Program (PAA); Luz para Todos (universal access to
          electricity); Million Cisterns Program (PMI); PETI (Program to Eradicate Child Labor);
          Casa Nova Vida Nova (CNVN - improved housing); and PNCF (National Land Reform
          Program);
      x   About 31% believed these programs integrated their activities, while another 35%
          believed that the individual structure, goals, methodology and philosophy of each
          program prevented their integrated action;

5.8       Association/organization membership and participation:

      x   About 70% of interviewees did not see the adhesion of beneficiaries to an association as a
          key qualifier during subproject preparation and said subprojects attended both members
          and non-members, respecting the Operational Manual in regard to the target population;
      x   85% said their subproject attended the general community but were unable to distinguish
          accurately the Project’s attendance of women, youth, indigenous and quilombola groups,
          although clearly this project expanded the coverage of such groups compared to Phase I;
      x   At the time of the survey, some 2,291 associations were registered and despite their
          “fragilities? they were generally viewed as an advance in democratization, access to
          public policies, and a factor in local social capital formation;
      x   In regard to community participation, a majority said women and men participate equally,
          were mainly adults, that participation did not depend on educational level, and 57% said
          they were formal members of an organization;

5.9       Main problems facing communities:

      x   In order of importance, these are: job opportunities; basic sanitation; water supply; roads;
          technical assistance; land; agricultural credit; housing; schools; and energy;
      x   62.1% said their subproject had not resolved or overcome even one of these challenges
          while another 32.6% said that some of these issues had been partially resolved, e.g.,
          technical assistance, employment conditions, access to means of production, expansion
          of area cultivated;
      x   These results signal the limited nature of the investments, especially those conducted
          directly by public authorities/government - beneficiaries needed more resources to
          expand, operate and maintain services already implemented such as water supply;
      x   Investments with fewer problems were linked directly to production, e.g., tractors,
          animals and equipment;

5.10      Impact of investments on families:

      x   87.5% said their quality of life had improved following their investment;



                                                  59
   x   Families considered their subproject had generally positive impacts: “plowin g, transport,
       and assistance with rations and silage? (tractors); “treated water prevents sickness? (water
       supply); “our fishing expanded and incomes too? (boats/equipment);

5.11   Timeliness of subproject execution:

   x   50.0% reported that their subproject was executed within the expected time, while 30.4%
       complained of delayed execution: “lack of commitment by the contractor?, “we made
       many trips with documents?, “huge document requirements?, “PRONESE’s bureaucracy
       and slowness?;
   x   The rhythm of physical and financial execution is directly related to the management
       capacity of associations, PRONESE’s release of resources and the performance of
       contractors. When these factors converged, implementation was timely;

5.12   Release of subproject resources:

   x   About two-thirds of respondents were unaware that PRONESE released subproject
       resources in installments, while 34% believed it was necessary to ensure that firms
       completed the works, and that it assisted associations to submit their statements of
       accounts (SOE); a small percentage were unhappy with the installments stating that they
       were still waiting for their third which was contingent on the environmental license, and
       that the period between installments was too long;

5.13   Procurement:

   x   When asked about the procurement process for subproject execution, 71% had no
       knowledge and had not been involved; another 24.6% confirmed that they had
       collaborated but it was difficult and resolving problems required expensive travel to the
       capital (PRONESE has no regional offices); nevertheless, they agreed that getting three
       quotes reduced prices, they were able to acquire more animals/other items;
   x   However, others complained of the bureaucracy, and that some firms did not want to
       participate in a competitive procurement process;

5.14   Transparency of the accounting process:

   x   58% were unable to respond on the subject of the transparency of the accounting process,
       while 39% confirmed that the process was clear and transparent and that it occurred “in
       meetings with everyone, and where everyone knew what had been purchased, how and
       the amount?; “guidance was provided and receipts presented?; “all stages of the process
       were clarified by the (association) president?; and, “we all knew what was happening?;

5.15   Technical assistance:

   x   The guaranteed supply of TA is stated in the Op. Man. for Categories 1 and 2
       (Subprojects and Institutional Development) and was to be included in subproject value
       up to 5% to assist with the execution phase;
   x   PRONESE contracted consultants (social services, civil and agronomic engineers), and
       for environmental safeguards established the NTGA;
   x   Due to the lack of technical assistance, 43.3% confirmed that they were unable to directly
       prepare and execute subprojects;

                                               60
   x   Technical assistance was delivered during the preparation, execution, operation and
       maintenance phases from diverse government agencies: PRONESE, EMDAGRO,
       PRONAF, SEBRAE, INCRA, the Mayors, Bank of the Northeast (BNB), Petrobras and
       NGOs, depending on the type of subproject (and who provided the financing since the
       survey question covered programs in general, not just the Project;
   x   TA quality was judged as good by only 8.5%, 66.1% said it was “regular? and 23.7%
       classified it as poor;
   x   In regards to TA for procurement and submission of accounts specifically, 71% were
       unable to respond and 5.8% said PRONESE had handled these functions (for
       tractors/equipment);
   x   These two activities also required significant expenditure by communities ranging from
       R$50.00 to R$5,000. (The Evaluation notes that expenses associated with TA for
       subproject preparation can be financed within the cost of the subproject, up to 3%, while
       other expenses can be counted as community counterpart contribution);

5.16   Environmental licenses and impact:

   x   77.2% of interviewees were unable to respond regarding the need for environmental
       licenses despite it being one of the requirements for access to project resources in most
       cases;
   x   In relation to the adequate and sustainable management of natural resources after
       subproject completion, 23.7% confirmed their awareness, stating that they are “using the
       tractor with more care for the land?, “collecting petrol cans?, “now repairing paths after
       the rains?, “preserving the margins of rivers and streams?, “not cutting the trees?, fishing
       within legal limits?, and “monitoring erosion?;
   x   67% showed little/no awareness of this issue;
   x   57% said there was no environmental impact from their subproject because “cisterns do
       not destroy the environment?, “we are very careful with the environment?, “goats don’t
       do any (environmental) harm?, “the area is inhabited, flat, and there’s nothing to
       destroy?;
   x   A very small proportion (4.5%) said their subproject had resulted in cutting of trees to
       build a small plant or involved the burning of oil, or use of herbicides;
   x   Given that 57.1% said there was no environmental impact and 38.4% did not respond, no
       measures were introduced to minimize or resolve such impacts. The reason why most
       respondents believed their subproject had no environmental impact was its small size,
       lack of understanding of the types of impacts which could be caused, and lack of
       knowledge of environmental laws;

5.17   Awareness/knowledge of subprojects:

   x   50% of interviewees lacked any knowledge of subproject preparation and execution, or
       understanding of value, cost, goals, and number of beneficiaries. A very high proportion
       lacked any understanding of the procurement process, submission of accounts, or
       environmental licensing;
   x   These results suggest that much information is concentrated in the association leadership
       and with firms/contractors even though public dissemination of this information is
       required by the Project and signage with the name of the subproject, association, the
       Bank, PRONESE/other is installed at all sites. Even so, communities are not absorbing
       this information perhaps due to their education level, suggesting that the form of publicity
       is unsuited to the Project clientele;

                                               61
5.18       Involvement in subproject execution:

   x       78.6% of interviewees believed participation in subproject execution was important
           whether through meetings, presentation of proposals and the monitoring and oversight of
           subprojects at all stages, many of which activities constituted communities’ counterpart
           contribution;
   x       81.3% reported their direct involvement in subproject execution through participation in
           meetings, financial contributions, their labor, construction of pens for animals, sheds for
           tractors, transport, and provision of food to workers;

5.19       Operation and maintenance:

   x       42% confirmed they had or were adopting procedures and financing for O&M; another
           13% said their subprojects were recently-completed and they had not made O&M plans;
           45% had no response on this issue;
   x       Respondents said “most beneficiaries pay charges for using the tractor?, “50% of fees for
           the tractor are going into a reserve fund?, “each resident is responsible for his/her
           cistern?;

5.20       Access to new financing after subprojects:

   x       38.4% of beneficiaries interviewed confirmed that they sought/obtained new financing
           after the Project, including for: cattle (SEBRAE technical assistance); electricity (Luz
           para Todos); credit (Bank of Northeast Brazil, PRONAF); marketing of their products
           (Food Purchasing Program, PAA); and irrigation (CODEVASF), among others;
   x       24% did not obtain new financing because “difficulties are huge?, and “the doors don’t
           open?; about 37.5% did not respond;
   x       This experience implies that new financing requires partnerships and complementarity
           between activities, human resources and financing; also, there are no interventions able to
           address the full complement of needs faced by poor communities.

5.21       Municipal Councils and beneficiary attitudes:

       x   69.2% knew about their Municipal Council and were clear about its responsibilities,
           functions and decision-making; these views tended to be consistent with the content of
           the Op. Man. stressing consultation with communities, priorities of communities,
           information on access to financing, collective decision-making, support for communities,
           help in preparing subprojects, and participation;
       x    64.7% said they knew and had appointed their association president to represent them in
           the Council;
       x    Most responded that results of the creation of their Council included: “communities now
           believed that projects would come?; “we started to be able to access programs?, “our
           knowledge increased and leaders were stimulated to participate in municipal public
           policies?, “associations sought to conform to project requirements?;
       x   42.4% said that the Mayor participated in the preparation, execution and operation of
           subprojects through provision of land and premises, payment for transport, food,
           instructors and document services, helping resolve the indebtedness of associations,
           contacting institutions, and security;
       x   28.6% reported the Mayor as not participating and in some cases, actively impeding
           associations in various ways;

                                                  62
5.22   Importance of subprojects to the Municipalities:

   x   Subprojects represent savings of resources, increased revenues, generation of
       employment and income opportunities within the Municipality, insertion in socio-cultural
       activities especially for youth;
   x   Impact on municipalities is evidenced by the following comments: “the band plays at
       public events such as inaugurations and September 7?, “reduced demands on the Mayor
       to use the municipal tractor?, “the money paid to buy ice stays in the municipality?,
       “income for the municipality from the sale of animals (payment of taxes on the corral of
       R$1.00/animal)?, “we have water now and don’t have to ask the Mayor (to send the water
       tanker)?, “whatever serves the community reduces the work of the Mayor?.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

A. Executive Summary of Borrower’s Final Report: 29 (Informal Translation)

7.1     The Project to Combat Rural Poverty (PCPR) of the State of Sergipe, in its second phase,
subject of Loan 7595-BR, executed in the period from June 17, 2009 to June 30, 2012, was part
of a group of similar projects financed by the World Bank and the Governments of the States of
the Northeast Region of Brazil, whose decentralized, participatory design and execution started in
1993 using the approach known to the Bank as Community-Driven Development (CDD).

7.2     From a historical point of view, the second phase of the PCPR represented the
culmination of a process of learning with the incorporation of lessons learned under previous
phases. These earlier phases can be summarized as follows:

     x   In the period 1985-1993, under the label of the Project to Support Small Rural Producers
         (PAPP), a small pilot component was introduced known as the Program to Support Small
         Rural Communities (APCR) which included the participation of the communities in both
         the definition of priorities as well as the execution of investments;
     x   Owing to the success of the APCR – in fact one of the few successful PAPP activities – it
         was decided in 1993 to completely reformulate the PAPP, eliminating all traditional
         components and substituting them with the APCR. This phase was known as the
         Reformulated PAPP and was executed, in Sergipe, in the period from 1993-1995, and in
         which two decision-making mechanisms were introduced for the analysis and approval of
         community demands: (i) Program to Support Communities (PAC), and the Municipal
         Community Support Fund (FUMAC) which in the State of Sergipe was executed in
         conjunction with the Municipal Development Councils (CONDEM). Under PAC,
         communities related directly to the Project Technical Unit which later became The
         Sustainable Development Company of Sergipe (PRONESE), to present their demands,
         while in municipalities selected to execute an experimental (pilot) through the
         CONDEMs, communities presented their demands to these Councils. The Councils, with
         majority representation of the beneficiary communities, decided to approve and send
         approved proposals, in order of priority, to PRONESE for final approval.
     x   In the final stages of this earlier program, due to the superior benefits from the
         FUMAC/CONDEM compared to PAC, one could already see the increase in the number
         of municipalities utilizing the Council mechanism, so that under the following phase it
         was decided to expand coverage of municipalities with FUMAC/CONDEM and restrict
         usage of the PAC mechanism to just a few municipalities. This phase lasted from 1996
         to 2001. The project deepened decentralization by introducing an even more
         decentralized delivery mechanism, the FUMAC-P/CONDEM-P under which some
         Councils came to directly manage financial resources destined to finance Community
         subprojects.
     x   The following stage, the PCPR II, with its first phase initiated in April 2002 and
         concluded in June 2006, continued the process of perfecting/refining targeting and

Summary. Further, the Borrower belatedly enhanced its Final Evaluation to include details normally included in a BCR
(which was not produced separately) but these were delivered to the Bank too late to be taken into account for the ICR.
The draft ICR was discussed directly with the PRONESE team following the Bank’s Quality Enhancement Review and
points of difference are included in the text and attached Borrower Letter (Annex 7).

        decentralization of project activities and even though this new mechanism had not had a
        consistent, decisive experience, the FUMAC/CONDEM Council was universalized.

7.3     This executive summary presents in more detail, the vision of PRONESE and the
beneficiaries concerning the performance of the PCPR II-Phase II, with the understanding that it
represents the fruit of a long learning process.

7.4      The PCPR II-Phase II started officially in June 17, 2009 with the declaration of
effectiveness of the World Bank Loan of US$20.8 million. The Loan was 88.3% disbursed.
With State counterpart and beneficiary contribution, Phase II involved investments totaling
around US$25.07 million. As under previous phases PRONESE, an entity linked initially to the
State Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN), and from March 2011 to the State Secretariat of
Agriculture and Rural Development (SEAGRI), functioned as the Project Technical Unit.

7.5     Description of the PCPR II: The central objective of Phase II was to contribute to and
support the Government of the State of Sergipe to reduce rural poverty by:

    x   improving the living conditions of the poorest populations through community
        investments (subprojects) in productive projects with the creation of basic infrastructure
        to generate employment and income to satisfy their most urgent, priority needs, as well as
        socio-cultural, infrastructure and environmental projects;
    x   decentralization of the allocation of financial resources and decision-making to the local
        level through support to Municipal Development Councils (CONDEM) and to
        community organizations and associations of beneficiaries in the planning and
        prioritization of subprojects, and the execution and maintenance of investments;
    x   stimulating the creation and consolidation of community organizations, associations and
        Councils which could serve as instruments for planning, social control, expression of the
        needs of poor communities to overcome the barriers to their economic and social
        development.

7.6     Of the 75 municipalities in the State of Sergipe, the Project reached an area involving 71
with the exception of municipalities comprising the Metropolitan Region of Aracaju.

Component A: Community Subprojects

7.7     The financing of community subprojects represented the principal project component,
concentrating over 85% of total investments, in essence, a proposal for investments identified,
executed, operated and maintained by the communities through their associations. This
component concentrated 88.37% of total Loan resources corresponding to US$22.158 million of
subprojects (external resources, plus state and beneficiary counterpart). It was initially envisaged
financing 1,000 community subprojects, and later on under the restructuring authorized by the
World Bank, the target was reduced to 500, economic infrastructure, health education, cultural
investments, environmental, productive and others, demanded by beneficiary communities and
contemplated in Municipal and Territorial Action Plans, with the targeted 20,000 families
remaining as is.

Component B: Institutional Development

7.8     This component was designed to finance the provision of technical assistance and
training to increase the capacity of instances involved in the implementation of the Project
including as a priority the Municipal Councils and PRONESE itself, as well as NGOs active in

                                                66
the municipalities, social movements and governmental organizations, these last considered the
integration matrix. It was also the original intention of the Phase II to (i) provide funds for
technical assistance and support to the State of Sergipe on issues related to the modernization and
reform of the State in order to have a positive impact on poverty reduction; this assistance was an
integral part of a broader dialogue between the State and the World Bank; and (ii) support
expanded use of information technology to increase transparency and connect communities and
the Municipal Councils to markets.

7.9      For this component, some US$2.20 million was initially envisaged of total Project cost,
altered in January 2012 to US$2.238 million to finance training and technical assistance activities
for the Municipal Councils and Community Associations; dissemination of information about the
Project; impact evaluation studies; and, institutional development of PRONESE, SEAGRI and
SEPLAG as well as incorporation of activities which would permit the Councils to execute
“electronic transparency?.

Component C: Project Administration

7.10    This component financed the incremental costs of PRONESE with activities related to the
coordination and administration of Phase II including supervision, impact monitoring and
evaluation, using resources initially estimated at US$0.240 million, later restructured to
US$0.840 that is, US$0.6 million for supervision and US$0.240 million for administration.

7.11    The amount reserved for contingencies or non-allocated, US$0.638 million was
reallocated to Category 3 Parts B and C, as described above.

Strategy for PCPR II - Phase II Implementation

7.12     Phase II execution was decentralized, participatory and sustainable due to the signing of
agreements between PRONESE and community associations, with the approval of the Municipal
Councils, to implement community subprojects. The associations were not mere implementers of
subprojects, but with their participation in the Councils, Action Plans were prepared and
approved in which the priorities and targets for each municipality were defined. From the
decision-making point of view, the Project was approved basically in the Councils who were
responsible for verifying beneficiary eligibility and providing opinions on all initial proposals for
financing, constituting in this manner, the initial consultative, decision-making and monitoring
entity for subproject implementation. It was also the Councils’ responsibility to link the Project
with other local policies, as well as to ensure that Project beneficiaries were included in these
policies.

7.13    Evidently, the Project was also boosted by the participation and autonomy of its primary
beneficiaries: poor populations and their community associations. Successful implementation of
community subprojects depended and depends on them, allowing the strengthening of local
groups and entities and the development of social capital.

7.14     In the State Plan, PRONESE has responsibility for establishing the general directives as
well as annual project physical and financial targets through preparation of the Annual Operating
Plan (POA), as well as ensuring harmony between this plan and other State Government
plans/actions, and to evaluate project execution as a whole. In addition, PRONESE must provide
final judgment on the technical and economic viability of subprojects, ensure the provision of
technical assistance, the monitoring and supervision of the subprojects, as well as identifying any
observed impacts from their implementation. The general directives of PRONESE, printed by the

                                                 67
State Government, contain guidance related to activities in Areas 1 and 2, divided territorially
based on poverty level: Area 1, with the poorest and IDH-M less than 0.623, totaling 41
municipalities, and less poor, with IDH-M above 0.623, the remaining 30 municipalities.

7.15     The World Bank, financier of the Loan for the State of Sergipe, was an important partner
in the management and implementation of Phase II, taking into account its global mission to
direct and support long-term initiatives which promote poverty reduction, sustainable growth and
social inclusion within a broad development paradigm. Periodically, performance of the Loan
Agreement was evaluated physically, financially, and institutionally through supervision missions
by the Bank Team which tried to verify evidence of possible social, economic and environmental
impacts, proposing solutions if judged necessary.

Principal Results of PCPR II-Phase II:

7.16    As stated earlier, the Loan Agreement 7595-BR, between the World Bank and
Government of the State of Sergipe, defined as the primary project component, the financing of
community subprojects. In relation to appraisal estimates, physical performance can be
considered very good, having achieved and even slightly exceeded the target for subprojects
financed: 545 vs. 500 projected, reaching 109% of the target,

7.17   Some 21,966 families were benefited of which 10,808 received productive subprojects
(49.25%), 7,785 received infrastructure (35.44%), and 3,363 received socio-cultural subprojects
(15.31%). The target was 20,000 families and the Project achieved 109% of the target.

7.18    A result worth mentioning is that of the 21,966 families benefited with 545 subprojects,
11,042 families (50.27%) were headed by women. The participation of female heads of
household was greater in the social subprojects (60.18%). Women’s participation exceeded 80%
of families benefited with housing investments, needlework/crafts and small-scale clothes making.
The least participation of women was in subprojects for fishing equipment, dairy plants, irrigation
systems, and acquisition of pumping equipment. Further, 30.28% of associations with financed
subprojects were headed by women.

7.19     The 545 subprojects were provided to 67 of the 71 municipalities comprising the project
area, involving 430 communities and 442 community associations (average 1.23 subprojects per
association).

7.20    In the perception of beneficiaries, their involvement in local organizations has enabled
greater ownership of subprojects under Phase II, understood as the result of a collective effort and
as the patrimony of the community or the association, contributing without doubt to an increase in
social capital in their communities, and the organization and strengthening of community
associations.

7.21    Data presented in the report show that there was a significant and unquestionable
contribution to the development of the communities in areas benefited. It is not possible to affirm
that only the actions of the Phase II project induced this development however, due to the nature
and dimension of the subprojects executed, it can be supposed that the Project has contributed, to
different degrees, to the evolution of social capital, and to community organization, even from the
sense of preparing their own proposals, and in addition to the effects of participation on everyone
involved.



                                                68
7.22    The community organizations depend, in the development of their activities and besides
the PCPR II, on the support of governmental organizations especially EMDAGRO, and non-
governmental (Councils and rural workers unions), in addition to other programs and projects,
especially Bolsa Familia and PRONAF. In this sense, PRONESE’s contribution, through the
PCPR II, in the formation and development of social capital of the communities has been shared,
as can be observed in the financing of the Project, the organization of groups, and the mutual
cooperation for achieved project objectives.

Results and Impact

7.23     The scale of the PCPR II permitted the assurance that the Project effectively contributed
to (i) increase the existing stock of social and economic infrastructure, creating opportunities for
business, operating agricultural equipment, increase in area cultivated and production, and greater
social and community harmony; (ii) increase in social capital of communities in the interior of the
State, organization into community associations and their strengthening; (iii) stimulated the
formation of local leaders and citizen groups through the strengthening and consolidation of the
Municipal Councils which were transformed into a stage for the discussion of action plans and
establishing priorities for financing; (iv) the force and prestige of the Councils is not however,
uniform for all municipalities however, various of them are notable for having considerable
influence on government agencies, civil society and financial institutions; (v) through the
community subprojects, the conditions were established for new opportunities, allowing the
communities to enjoy a higher quality of life.

7.24    The vision of beneficiaries, as shown from field interviews, tends to support the
conclusion that Phase II was a success, while at the same time showing as well, certain
unsatisfactory aspects. According to the research, data indicate that in the perception of
beneficiaries, improvements in quality of life of rural communities depends not only on
implementing infrastructure, income and job-creating subprojects but also investments which
increase human, social and natural capital of communities. In the opinion of 80.8% of
beneficiaries, the financing of subprojects generated direct impacts such as business opportunities,
better access due to paving of roads/pathways, acquisition of agricultural equipment, and
increased area cultivated.

7.25    Beneficiaries also thought that their involvement in local organizations enabled them to
access to the Project, understood as the result of collective efforts and as the patrimony of the
community or association and to some extent the government.

7.26     On the other hand, beneficiaries showed that the identification of demand, preparation
and execution of subprojects are beneficiary activities which count heavily on the involvement of
the association leadership especially the President and Treasurer, and that this involvement at
times inhibits a more ample participation of more beneficiaries. The tendency is for greater direct
beneficiary involvement in infrastructure and social subprojects. It should also be noted that, due
to the limited size of subprojects they tend to benefit only a part of the community, not reaching
all of those also eligible.

7.27    According to field research, not all beneficiaries have a clear idea of the functioning of
the Councils. The 69.2% who did understand believed that the experience with the Councils
generated important results; they saw them as a space for discussion and negotiation of the
population’s interests. The considered that the Councils had provoked change including:
expanded knowledge about subproject execution; access to other government programs/projects;
organizations of associations and greater participation in the definition of subprojects. The

                                                69
believed also that they had the conditions and knowledge to manage the Council but raised
questions about bureaucracy, lack of autonomy, lack of adequate infrastructure to work, lack of
information and training to attend to the norms and operational procedures of the Project, and
political intervention. Basically, the options for overcoming these difficulties ought to come from
better access to information, knowledge, permanent/continuous training and support, respect for
the Councils’ autonomy, the transfer of the maintenance resources to which they were entitled
(under the Operational Manual), and greater involvement of the State.

7.28     In terms of the qualitative evaluation by project beneficiaries, surveys show among other
things, that the Project represents a concrete hope that their lives will improve, through increased
social capital, restoration of citizenship, improved working conditions, and restoration of identity
and preservation of local cultural traditions in the case of the quilombolas. The project
represented access to public policies.

Challenges faced by the Project and by PRONESE and Lessons Learned:

7.29    During project implementation, PRONESE confronted a number of challenges which,
while they did not affect the success in achieving the project’s development objectives, certainly
contributed to delaying the achievement of targets and at times, put at risk the quality of results
achieved.

7.30     On May 25, the State Government sent Oficio no. 2.138/2011 to the Secretariat of
International Affairs (SEAIN) requesting the following in regards to the Loan Agreement:
    x Change the representative of the State of Sergipe as counterpart in the Loan Agreement,
         modifying the coordinating entity from the Secretariat of Planning, Housing and Urban
         Development (SEPLAN) to the State Secretariat of Agriculture and Rural Development
         (SEAGRI), preserving the administration and execution under the responsibility of
         PRONESE as per Article 3. Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement;
    x Considering the long period between the date of loan approval with the World Bank in 23
         September 2008 and effectiveness in July 17, 2009, complicated by the urgent need to
         restructure the Municipal Councils and community associations, co-executors and
         beneficiaries respectively in project implementation, due to the protracted period between
         the conclusion of Phase I (June 2006), (the Project required) extension of the Loan
         Agreement for another 18 months, from December 31, 2011, to June 30, 2013.
    x Due to this extension, for a period of two more years, a re-definition of agreed targets
         was required, re-distributing them among the additional years, in the form suggested
         below but maintaining unchanged the number of families benefited (20,000) with the
         following justifications:

             Indicators              Year 1          Year 2      Year 3       Year 4       Total
                                     2008-10          2011        2012         2013
    Subprojects financed:              156            103         207           34         500
    Area 1                             122             68         140           20         350
    Area 2                             34              35          67           14         150
    Families benefited:               8,446          3,954       6,600        1,000       20,000


        x   With the objective of ensuring adequate physical and financial oversight of project
            execution, required the reallocation of resources by category amounting to
            US$638,000 drawn from the Unallocated category, as described below:

                                                70
            x    Re-composition of Category 3 (administrative costs) saw the reallocation of
                 US$600,000 of resources from the Unallocated Category, that is, US$200,000 for
                 operational costs (3(a)); US$400,000 for supervision costs (3(b)). This demand was
                 associated with the fact that PRONESE was headquartered in the capital and
                 exercised its responsibilities via partnership with the community associations and
                 Municipal Councils in the entire area reached by the Project which corresponded to
                 71 municipalities of the State. While PRONESE counted on an adequate
                 administrative structure it still lacked regional offices in the municipalities to
                 minimize distances between beneficiaries and the Project, entailing high operational
                 and supervision costs. The request to reallocate to Category 3 was in order to ensure
                 that Loan resources were adequately used and project objectives achieved;

            x    Re-composition of Category 2 (Consultants and Training) which received US$38,000
                 also from the Unallocated Category;

            x    During pre-negotiations with the Secretariat of the National Treasury which preceded
                 the formalization and contracting of the Loan Agreement, the physical target
                 discussed was 800 subprojects.30 During project implementation it was perceived
                 that the average cost of subprojects had increased from US$24,000 as under Phase I,
                 to US$45,000 under Phase II entailing the need to reduce the physical target to 500
                 financed. In regard to the number of families to be benefited, while the average of
                 the initial subprojects financed was 60 per subproject due to the high proportion of
                 financing for tractors whose numbers of families benefited tended to be higher, and
                 the average families attended per subproject under Phase I was 26, at completion of
                 Phase II the Project had achieved 109%, maintaining the target originally agreed.

     The ICR notes that the final, agreed target was 1,000 subprojects, not 800.
