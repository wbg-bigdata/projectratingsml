marketable land  to  be  developed  thereunder  is for residential
purposes.
2.   Each Sub-loan under Part B of the Project shall be made only:
     (a)  to a Beneficiary: (i) which  is determined to be credit-
worthy; (ii) which owns no dwelling  other than the dwelling to be
constructed or purchased  under  the  Sub-project; and (iii) whose
monthly income is determined to be  not  more than DH 3,000 in the
case of Low-cost dwellings;  all  as  shall  be established to the
satisfaction of the Borrower  on  the  basis  of the Credit Policy
Guidelines; and

purchase of a  dwelling  whose  value  is  estimated not to exceed
DH 300,000; (ii) in respect of which all required approvals of the
concerned  authorities  have  been  secured;  and  (iii)  which is

3.   No expenditures for  goods  or  services  required for a Sub-
project shall be eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the
Loan unless:
     (a)  the  Sub-loan  for  such  Sub-project  shall  have  been
approved by the Bank  and  such  expenditures shall have been made
not earlier than ninety days prior  to  the date on which the Bank
shall have received the application and information required under
paragraph 4 (a) of this Schedule in respect of such Sub-loan; or

not earlier than ninety days prior  to  the date on which the Bank
shall have received  the  request  and  information required under
paragraph 4 (b) of  this  Schedule  in  respect of such free-limit
Sub-loan. For the purposes  of  this  Agreement, a free-limit Sub-
loan shall be a  Sub-loan  for  a  Sub-project  in an amount to be
financed out of the proceeds  of  the  Loan which shall not exceed
the  sum  of  $1,000,000  equivalent,  when  added  to  any  other
outstanding amounts financed or proposed to be financed out of the
proceeds of the Loan or  of  any  other  loan, provided for in any
outstanding loan  agreement  between  the  Bank  and  the Borrower
entered into before the  date  of  this Agreement, the proceeds of
which have been or are being used for financing goods and services
directly and materially related to such Sub-project.
4.   (a)  When presenting a Sub-loan (other than a free-limit Sub-
loan) to the Bank for approval,  the Borrower shall furnish to the
Bank an application, in  form  satisfactory  to the Bank, together
with: (i) a description  of  the  Beneficiary and the appraisal of
the Sub-project  carried  out  pursuant  to  paragraph  1  of this
Schedule, including a description  of the expenditures proposed to
be financed out of  the  proceeds  of  the Loan; (ii) the proposed
terms and conditions of  the  Sub-loan,  including the schedule of
amortization of the Sub-loan, whenever appropriate; and (iii) such
other information as the Bank shall reasonably request.

proposed to be  financed  out  of  the  proceeds  of the Loan, and
(ii) the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Sub-loan, including the
schedule of amortization therefor whenever appropriate.
     (c)  Applications and  requests  made  pursuant  to  the pro-
visions of sub-paragraphs (a) and  (b)  of this paragraph shall be

in the Statement of Policy and Credit Policy Guidelines and on the
following principal terms and conditions:

the proceeds of  the  Loan  at  a  reasonable price, account being
taken also of other relevant factors  such as time of delivery and
efficiency and  reliability  of  the  goods  and,  in  the case of
services, of  their  quality  and  the  competence  of the parties
rendering them; (C) use such goods and services exclusively in the
carrying out of  the  Sub-project;  (D)  enable  the  Bank and the
Borrower to inspect the sites, works, and construction included in

Borrower shall reasonably request relating to the foregoing and to
the administration,  operations  and  financial  condition  of the
Beneficiary and  to  the  benefits  to  be  derived  from the Sub-
project; and (ii) provisions to  ensure  the right of the Borrower
to suspend or terminate the right of the Beneficiary to the use of
the proceeds of  the  Loan  upon  failure  by  such Beneficiary to
perform its  obligations  under  its  contract  with  the Borrower
providing for the Sub-loan.
     (b)  Further to  the  foregoing,  each  Sub-loan  for  a Sub-
project under Part B of  the  Project  shall be made on additional
terms whereby the Borrower shall  obtain, by written contract with
the beneficiary or by  other appropriate legal means, undertakings
that the Beneficiary shall utilize  the dwelling to be constructed
or purchased under the Sub-project as its principal residence.
