STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SECOND HOUSING FINANCE PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
BORROWERS:          Kingdom of Morocco, and
Credit Immobilier et Hotelier (CIH)
GUARANTOR:          Kingdom of Morocco (for the loan to CIH)
BENEFICIARIES:      Ministry of Interior (MOI), Ministry of Housing (MOH), and
CIH
AMOUNT:             US$3 million to the Kingdom of Morocco and
US$77.5 million to CIH
TERMS:              Both loans will be repayable in 20 years including five
years of grace at the standard variable interest rate.
PROJECT
OBJECTIVES:         The shortage of urban housing is an acute problem in
Morocco, particularly for low-income households.
Construction and mortgage financing covers only 15% of
total housing investment compared with 20-25% in most other
developing nations. Credit mainly benefits the
construction of housing for middle- and higher-income
groups. Housing for low-income groups is constrained not
only by scarce financial resources, but also by the lack of
appropriately priced land, taxing land-use, infrastructure
and building regulations, and rigid administrative
procedures. Against that background, the project will help
widen the scope and improve the functioning of housing
finance as well as rationalize land and housing supply,
with particular emphasis on low- and moderate-cost housing.
PROJECT
DESCRIPTION:        To achieve its objectives the project will provide CIH
with: (a) a line of credit (US$77 million) to support its
lending for low- and moderate-cost housing; and (b)
technical assistance funds (US$0.5 million) for studies to
improve its knowledge and understanding of the housing
supply system, to develop new savings and credit products,
and to adapt its management information and internal audit
systems to its new depository and lending activities. In
addition, the project will finance institution-building
activities (US$3 million) designed to upgrade the
Government's capability to facilitate land and housing
development.



(ii)
BENEFITS
AND RISKS:          Social benefits will include enhancing access to home
ownership and improving the housing conditions of
low-income groups. The economic and institutional benefits
will include rationalizing the structure of the housing
finance sector, further strengthening CIH's operations, and
improving the efficiency of land and housing delivery
processes. The project will also have a positive
environmental impact by limiting the development of
informal housing on unserviced land through increased
provision of low- and moderate-cost housing. The main
risks under the project are that: (a) CIH's lending
operations and profitability may be limited by the tight
financial market in Morocco and the rising cost of
long-term resources; (b) CIH may be unable to channel
credit towards the lowest income groups because of
inadequate low- and moderate-cost housing supply; and
(c) the results of the institution-building activities to
be carried out by the Government may be slow to
materialize. The project design, however, mitigates these
risks through appropriate conditionalities as well as
through flexibility in the eligibility criteria for the use
of the loan proceeds.

SECOND HOUSING FINANCE PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01     High population growth rates and relentless rural-to-urban migration
have given rise to an entrenched urban housing shortage in Morocco. This
shortage is particularly acute for low-income households because the supply
system is unable to produce affordable low- and moderate-cost housing and
financial institutions do not participate in its financing. Overcrowding,
shared housing, and shanty towns are visible consequences and adversely affect
social stability and economic development.
1.02     The project would improve mobilization of resources and availability
of credit for low- and moderate-cost housing. It would also help remove
present administrative, regulatory, and organizational constraints to land
development and housing construction. These objectives wouid be achieved
through a loan to help the Cr6dit Immobilier et Hotelier (CIH) step up its
lending for low- and moderate-cost housing and another loan to the Kingdom of
Morocco to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Interior (MOI) and the
Ministry of Housing (MOH) to facilitate low-cost land development and housing
construction. Beyond the above objectives, the project would contribute to
the liberalization of the financial sector, according to present government
policy. This would be achieved by improving CIH's operations and
profitability, and thus enabling it to compete effectively with commercial
banks in both mobilizing reso-urces and extending credit.
1.03     The Bank loan to CIH would be in the amount of US$77.5 million;
US$77 million would be onlent for low- and moderate-cost housing development
and US$o.5 million used for studies. The loan to the Kingdom of Morocco would
be in the amount of US$3 million
1.04     CIH is well known to the Bank.  It has already received four loans
for hotel and tourism development, amouating to US$148.8 million, and a
housing finance loan of US$60 million. At the end of April 1989, the latter
was fully committed and disbursements exceeded US$50 million. In 1987, CIH
also received a line of credit in the amount of US$50 million for hotel
financing from IFC. This loan is fully disbursed and is being replenished by
new IFC funding, negotiated in June 1989. MOI and MOH have a long-standing
dialogue with the Bank on urban and housing development. The latter Ministry
has been the implementing agency for two lending operations (Rabat Urban
Development Project, Loan 1508-MOR; Second Urban Development Project, Loan
1944-MOR) supporting urban renewal and sites and services development.
1.05     This report describes the background, objectives, and content of the
project; updates information on CIH's organization, operations and finances;
and assesses the expected contribution of MOI and MOH to successful project
implementation.

II. THE HOUSING SECTOR
A. Urban Growth Patterms
2.01     Morocco's urban population has increased rapidly over the past three
decades, expanding from 29% of the total population in 1960 to 45% in 1986, at
an annual growth rate of 4.5%. During the last ten years, this rapid
urbanization has taken place in the context of a stressed economic situation.
The country has been beset by severe budgetary and balance ox payments
deficits, which the Government is trying to control through financial
adjustment and economic stabilization programs. These unfavorable conditions,
compounded by real income stagnation, have significantly limited the capacity
of the public and private sectors to respond to the service, infrastructure,
and housing needs of an increasing number of urban dwellers. Although rural
outmigration has decreased in intensity, it will continue well into the next
decade and contribute to the growth of urban centers, which are projected to
account for about 50% of the country's nearly 32 million inhabitants by the
year 2000.

Demographiques (CERED).
2.02     Morocco's urban settlement pattern is relatively well balanced.
The primacy of Greater Casablanca with a (1986) population of 2.5 million
(about a quarter of the total urban population) is compensated for by the
dynamic growth of Rabat-Sa1 with a (1986) population of about one million
and a substantial network of small- and medium-sized cities, 15 of which
have (1986) populations exceeding 100,000. The rapid pace of urbanization
will heavily tax the absorptive capacity of all urban centers and exacerbate
such problems as deteriorating utility networks, inadequate municipal
services, and a growing housing shortage. The total housing stock is
estimated (1986) at about 3.7 million units, 1.8 million of which are in
urban areas. This includes the informal sector, which comprises informal,
i.e., unlauthorized housing (habitat clandestin) and slums (bidonvilles), and
accounts for about 20% of the total stock.



- 3 -
B. Hous!ng Demand
z.03     In the context of the preparation of the 1988-1992 Five-Year
Economic Plan, MOH has estimated that the elimination of the present urban
housing shortage and the replacement of obsolete structures will require the
production of approximately 100,000 units p.a. over the next ten years. The
production required to meet new demand is estimated at about 90,000 units
p.a.  Though these figures are c iarly overestimated, they underscore the
magnitude of the urban housing p..oblem, particularly when compared with the
production during the last five years (1984-1988) which averaged
72,000 units p.a. (including informal housing). Although housing stock
conditions have improved in recent years, one-third of existing dwellings
are substandard or lack basic sanitary facilities. In addition, the housing
stock is severely overcrowded. The average number of persons per room in
urban dwellings is estimated at 2.1, with approximately 60% of all urban
households living in one- and two-room units.-I  The proportion of
households presently sharing a dwelling exceeds 10%.
2.04     Housing demand mainly stems from households that are temporarily
lodged in rental properties, cohabiting, or just moving into urban areas.
To a minor extent, it is also determined by upward mobility and the desire
to improve housing conditions. Few new households have the financial means
to accede to homeownership. Available data on household income, expenditure
structure, and homeownership status show that: (a) the poorest 20% of urban
households had only 3.7% of total available income; (b) housing expenditures
represent about 22.7% of the urban household's total expenditures and that
their elasticity to income is the second lowest after expenditures on food;
and (c) approximately 40% of households are lodged in re.tal property.
2.05     Most rental units are in two-story attached houses in which owners
informally rent the upper floors for additional income.  The Habous, 2
insurance companies, social security agencies, as well as numerous public
enterprises and ministerial departments, are the other main owners of rental
housing. Rents on individually-owned units generally reflect market
conditions, since owners often evade rent-control legislation through
informal rental agreements. On the other hand, rents on public housing as
well as units held by major private investors barely cover maintenance
costs. Standing in the way of cost recovery are questionable legislative
constraints (para. 2.23), weak management, and policies favoring specific
categories of workers and social groups.
2.06     Income level, consumption patterns, and homeownership status also
determine the various types of housing demand. Low- and moderate-income
households prefer attached houses. These are usually built by force account

and maintenance of mosques and other religious and social facilities,
such as schools.

with traditional construction techniques on small lots varying from 80 m2 to
120 m2. Middle- and upper-income groups choose to live in centrally located
apartments or in suburban single-family homes. The choine of a house by all
income groups is generally cons4dered a permanent, once-in-a-lifetime
decision. This leads either to overinvestment or to evolutionary construction
processes in which a house is expanded and remodeled over time according to
the changing needs and financial resources of the household.
C. Housing Supply
2.07     Housing demand is met by a supply system mainly comprising private
contractors and construction enterprises. Small- and medium-size land and
housing developers participate in this process and have recently expanded
their activities. Many contractors and enterprises are artisans and
traditionally cater to a low- and moderate-income clientele constructing
evolutionary attached houses. On the other hand, until recently, developers
have catered to a high-income clientele. However, the demand for high-priced
units has declined along with the stagnation of real income. Developers are,
therefore, turning increasingly to a moderate-income clientele; a few have
even begun to specialize in building homes for low-income households. A
considerable share of new houses is produced informally by the owners
themselves, who often enlist the help of relatives, friends, and
piece-workers. These dwellings generally add to the existing unauthori2ed
housing stock (para. 2.02).
2.08     In the early 1970s, to cope with the housing demand by low-income
households and with critical urban housing shortages, the Government
encouraged MOH to move into housing production. In 1974, it established seven
Regional Development and Construction Agencies (ERACs). MOH's and the ERACs'
activities were intended to complement those of other Government-controlled
companies such as the Compagnie Gen6rale Immobiliere (CGI), the Societe pour
la Promotion de l'Habitat Locatif (SOPHAL), and the Compagnie Immobiliere et
Fonciere du Maroc (CIFM). Housing production by the private and public
sectors is summarized in the Table below:

2.09     Conccrned by implementation delays and cost overruns, MOH has
disengaged itself from direct land development and housing construction. In
1984, it established a special agency, Agence Nationale pour la Lutte contre
l'Habitat Insalubre (ANLHI), to carry out all infrastructure upgrading and
housing construction projects related to the elimination of slum areas. More
recently, at the beginning of 1988, it transferred the responsibility for
completing the land development projects from the Fond National d'Am6nagement
et d'Equipement des Terrains (FNAET) to the Socikt6 Nationale d'Equipement et
Construction (SNEC), a new public enterprise. Following major managerial,
operational, and financial restructuring in 1978, most ERACs evolved into
financially viable and dynamically managed enterprises operating on a broad
market front, ranging from social to high-standard housing. Over the past
five years, the ERACs' annual production averaged 2,700 housing units, or 3.8%
of the country's total. CGI, which is supported by the Caisse des Dep8ts et
Gestion (CDG), continues to maintain its market share with an annual average
production of 2,000 units, mainly aimed at middle-income households. SOPHAL
and CIFM have experienced operational problems resulting from uticertain
developm-r;t policies and continue to need restructuring measures.
2.10     The combined housing production in the private and public sectors
(para. 2.08) is estimated at about DH 7 to DH 8 billion (US$815-930 million)
annually. It represents 4.3% of GDP. Moreover, this production induces an
additional annual investment of DH 1.7-2 billion in related urban
infrastructure and DH 1-1.2 billion for furnishing and equipping new
dwellings. The contribution of the houising sector to Gross Fixed Capital
Formation (GFCF) was estimated at 20% in 1988. This excludes the informal
housing sector, for which data are nonexistent.

2.11     The housing construction industry is relatively efficient and
responsive to the needs of its clientele. The first consideration is proved
by housing production costs which compare favorably with those of other



- 6 -
countries in the region; the second by a full range of housiug typologies and
construction standards.
2.12     The development of housing affordable to low- and moderate- income
households remains the main sectoral issue. In spite of its declared
objective, public sector housing production has mainly benefitted
medium-income households. Public production of low- and moderate-cost housing
has been mainly associated with the upgrading and restructuring of slum areas,
thus it has been developed as a cure for an existing problem rather than as a
means to meet a specific housing demand segment. The production of low- and
moderate-cost housing by the private sector has been constrained by:
(a) scarcity of appropriately priced land; (b) excessive land-use,
infrastructure, and building requirements; and (c) the low rate of
participation by financial institutions in the financing of low- and
moderate-cost housing projects, which forces developers either to put up
equity contributions varying from 30% to 50% of the total investment cost or
to resort to expensive bridge financing. These above constraints have
contributed to the urban housing shortage. They have also led to the
development of unauthorized housing on unserviced or inadequately
infrastructured land. Generally, unauthorized housing units are adequate in
size and soundly built. Had there been sufficient affordable land available,
they probably would have been part of the formal construction circuit.
D. Housing Finnmce
2.13     Morocco has a well developed financial system including a Central
Bank (BM), 15 commercial banks, two government-controlled saving banks (Caisse
d'Epargne Nationale - CEN, and Cheques Postaux), and five specialized
institutions (Caisse de Depots et Gestion - CDG, Caisse Marocaine des March6s
- CMM, Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole - CNCA, Banqixe Nationale de
D6veloppement - BNDE, and Cr6dit Immobilier et Hotelier - CIH). Long- and
medium-term credit is available principally through CNCA, BNDE and CIH, which
specialize respectively in agricultural, industrial, and housing and tourism
development.
2.14     Banking activities are firmly controlled by BM, which fixes ceilings
on credit by commercial banks and determines maximum interest rates on loans
and minimum rates on deposits. BM also monitors the reserve and minimum
equity requirements of commercial banks, as well as their maximum exposure to
individual clients. Moreover, it establishes, in association with the
Ministry of Finance (MOF), the share of sight deposits that they have to
convert in Treasury instruments (35% in 1987) as well as preferential credits
and bonds of specialized financial institutions (12% in 1987).
2.15     Current interest rates on loans vary between 12% and 15%, compared
with an annual inflation rate of about 3% in 1987 and 2.5% in 1988. Interest
rates on local currency resources vary from nothing to 12%, depending on their
nature and maturity (e.g., sight deposits and long-term securities). No
financial institution is allowed to engage directly in foreign borrowings,
which are strictly monitored by the central monetary and financial
authorities. In effect, foreign exchange transactions are a monopoly of the
BM to which all foreign currency must be surrendered. Under this arrangement,
the Government (i.e., the Treasury) has so far assumed or shared the foreign
exchange risk on foreign borrowings by the specialized financial institutions
(Daras. 2.16, 3.22 and 3.23).



- 7 -
2.16     In 1985, the Government initiated a progressive adjustment of the
financial sector to reduce distortions in the level and structure of interest
rates, develop a broader money market, and strengthen institutional systems,
while fostering liberalization and promoting greater bank competition in the
sector. This process, which was supported by the Bank's Second Industrial and
Trade Policy Adjustment (ITPA II) Loan, has resulted in the establishment of
positive interest rates, a substantial reduction in interest rate subsidies,
improved mobilization of savings by the specialized financial institutions
that now can accept deposits as well as extended commercial credit, and the
shifting of part of the foreign exchange risk from the Treasury to the
financial institutions and their customers. Previously, the Treasury had
assumed the entire foreign exchangc risk. At present, the major distortion
remaining in the financial sector is related to the credit ceilings imposed by
the Government to preempt commercial banks' resources (over 40% in 1987) to
finance the budget deficit.
2.17     The financial institutions operating in the housing finance sector
are CIH, BCP, and the commercial banks. CNCA, the agricultural bank, lends
for rural housing. However, such lending activity is marginal. The
outstanding balance of the loan portfolio of each main financial institution
is presented in the table below:

2.18     The above figures include both construction and mortgage loans.
Housing loans represent approximately 12% of the total credit to the economy.
CIH plays the dominant role, financing over 60% of the total housing
investment. Commercial banks mainly provide construction loans, which carry
short maturities, usually of two to three years. The only commercial bank
(relatively) active in mortgage lending is the Banque Centrale Populaire
(BCP). It has been funding, on CIH's behalf, a low- and modei-ate-cost housing
program referred to as Habitation Bon Marche (HBM). Over the past three
years, BCP lending for this program averaged DH 70 million p.a. In 1973, BCP
and commercial banks introduced housing savings schemes. These activities
have come to a virtual standstill; neither the interest rate on deposits nor
the



-8
size and conditions of the associated loans have attracted sufficient
clientele.
2.19     Since March 1982, to step up resource mobilization for housing
finance, commercial banks have been required to earmark a portion of their
short-term deposits (6% as of 1988) for either direct lending or for purchase
of medium-term securities issued by CIH. Because of their tradition of risk
specialization, commercial banks have been reluctant to lend directly.
Furthermore, they cannot compete on tAie same terms as CIH, whose borrowers are
exempt from the Value-Added Tax (VAT) on interest and benefit from
interest-rate subsidies on mortgages for low- and moderate-cost housing (para.
2.21). This situation is bound to change as a result of Government financial
liberalization policies. The Government is also aware that reforming the
present system requires measures to improve banking regulations, selective
credit policies, and interest-rate systems (para. 2.30).
2.20     Financial intermediation is relatively well developed in Morocco.
However, the domestic financial market is tight and heavily constrained by
credit demand from the Treasury. This situation limits the funds available
for housing finance. In recent years, mortgage lending has accounted for only
15%, on average, of the total yearly capital investment in the housing
sector. Most of these funds have benefited medium- and high-income groups.
Government policies to redirect funds to low-income groups have been largely
frustrated by insufficient low- and moderate-cost housing supply. This is
partially due to the fact that a large share of the latter takes place in the
form of unauthorized housing construction (para. 2.12), which is ineligible
for credit.
2.21     CIH lending rates for construction and mortgage loans are pegged at
13.5% and 12% respectively, well above present and projected inflation rates
(2.5% in 1988 and 5% thereafter). The Government, however, subsidizes
mortgages financed by CIH by assuming part of the interest cost and exempting
CIH borrowers from the VAT. The final interest rates for mortgages charged to
borrowers range between 7% and 12% depending on their income and on the real
estate value, or Valeur Immobiliere Totale (VIT) of the purchased
property.-I  Interest-rate subsidies are presently available only to heads
of households with monthly income less than DH 3,000 (US$350) and for the
purchase of housing units with a VIT not exceeding DH 300,000 (US$35,000).
The subsidy is paid by the Treasury to CIH, which charges its borrowers the
final interest rate. In the past, the Treasury has been late in meeting its
payments. This has harmed CIH's liquidity position and profitability. To
alleviate the financial burden that interest-rate subsidies impose on the
Treasury and the serious resource constraints facing the economy, the
Government has progressively reduced such subsidies by realigning interest
According to Moroccan practice, the VIT is defined as the estimated
construction cost of the housing unit plus a conventional amount for the
cost of the land (DH 20,000 or US$2,300 except for low-cost units, which
is DH 10,000).



rates to the real cost of financial resources. Interest-rate subsidies have
also been reduced by not raising the VIT ceilings of housing units qualifying
for subsidized loans according to inflation.
E. Current Government Housing Policies
2.22     To stimulate housing production and homeownership, the Government
modified the real estate investment code (Code des Investissements
Immobiliers) in January 1988. The new code increases the fiscal advantages
granted to homebuyers by expanding tax exemptions and improving provisions for
accelerated depreciation. Essentially, it maintains existing balances between
investment incentives in housing sector and in other sectors such as tourism,
industry, mining, and exports. The Government also promotes the
implementation of special fiscal provisions introduced in 1985. These enable
private and public companies to reinvest 3% of their profits in housing or
other social facilities for their employees and deduct this investment from
their taxable income. Although this provision is, in principle, very
attractive, it is only implemented by 'Large firms due to the administrative
burden of managing housing construction. The development of the cooperative
system may help solve this problem (para. 2.24).
2.23     In 1980, the Government reacted to rising home rental prices by
enacting stringent controls which limit increases to once every three years
and permit tenants to take landlords to court in case of disagreement over
rent increases. This action contributed to a marked decline in the
availability of rental housing. Moderate- and medium-income households are
particularly penalized since rent controls are most easily enforced on the
moderate- and medium-cost housing stock and thus discourage institutional and
private investment. Low-income households generally rent on the informa'l
market, in which rent-control is unenforceable (para. 2.05). Aware of the
negative consequences of the present rent-control system on the availability
of rental property, MOH has drafted corrective legislation to be submitted
soon for Government approval.
2.24     Following European models, in October 1984, the Government enacted a
new law setting guidelines on the creation of cooperatives. There has already
been some success in implementing this law in the Ministry of Public Works,
which has established a special foundation to build social housings Fondation
des Oeuvres Sociales (FOS). Since its inception, the foundation has built
approximately 300 units at an average price of DH 87,000. The development
prospects of cooperatives could be enhanced by improving present legislation
concerning ownership rights and responsibilities for the collective parts of
multi-family residential buildings, for which MOH is currently preparing
amendments, and by increasing the availability of appropriately serviced and
priced land.
2.25     Insufficient supply of affordable serviced land has been a persistent
coastraint to housing development since the beginning of urbanization.  The
Government's decision to transfer responsibility for land development from MOH
to public enterprises under its tuteiage (e.g., ANHLI, SNEC, the ERACs) should
greatly enhance the development and delivery processes by eliminating some of
the administrative procedures constraining the operations of Government



- 10 -
departments. Additional steps, however, are needed to improve urban planning,
strengthen and extend utility networks, further cooperation among local
government authorities, landowners, and housing developers, and mobilize the
financial resources needed to carry out investments ih infrastructure. MOI
and MOH, which are responsible for intervening on the above issues, will take
steps to implement the sector institutional development programs envisaged
under this project (paras. 3.13-3.18).
F. Bank Experience in the Sector
2.26     The dialogue on the housing sector between the Bank and the
Government dates back to the mid-1970s and has resulted in three lending
operations. The first two operations in 1978 and 1981 were managed by the MOH
and focused on the upgrading of selected squatter settlements and the
development of shelter concepts affordable to the lowest income groups. The
third operation in 1983, which is now close to completion, focuses on
strengthening CIH's ability to lend for low- and moderate-cost housing
production, by funding technical assistance and construction and mortage loans.
2.27     Experience under the first two operations has generally shown that
appropriate institutional arrangements concerning land tenure, infrastructure
development, home improvement, and housing finance have a positive impact on
improving the housing conditions of the poorest population segments and on
restraining the proliferation of slum areas. Experience under the First
Housing Finance Loan indicates that the availability of credit greatly
enhances the development of low- and moderate-cost housing and access to
homeownership. In fact, the loan contributed to the construction of
approximately 16,000 dwellings with an average cost of US$11,000 (1986 prices)
or less than half the median cost of the total housing units financed by CIH.
From a macro-economic perspective, the loan has contributed to the increase in
housing output with improved cost efficiency, minimizing the impact of
expanded housing production on the availability of resources to other economic
sectors.
2.28     The experience gained from the First Housing Finance Loan also
teaches some important lessons for the design of future similar operations.
First, the housing market is an integrated system. Improving the amount of
credit available for medium-cost housing ultimately results in greater
availability of existing housing for low-income households. Excessively rigid
eligibility criteria for the use of Bank funds do not necessarily help the
poor but rather slow down their access to affordable housing. Second,
promoting the development of housing projects for low-income households
requires the combined actions of local government, municipal agencies, and
public and private entrepreneurs to ease procedural, regulatory, operational,
and marketing constraints. Availability of credit is a necessary but
insufficient condition, as demonstrated by the slow commitment pace of the
First Housing Finance Loan. Finally, the real earning, as well as saving,
capacity of low-income households is probably much greater than what is
revealed by available statistical data and income surveys. In addition, the
overall performance of low-income households in servicing their debt appears
to be equal if not better than that of higher-income households. This calls
for more flexible credit policies and the establishment of appropriately
targeted housing savings programs, possibly extended to land acquisition.

G. Project Rationale
2.29     The project will address critical issues related to housing
development in general and low- and moderate-cost housing in particular. It
comes at a critical time, when the Government is discussing ways and means to
promote a more dynamic role for local authorities and public agencies in the
development of serviced land and low- and moderate-cost housing. In keeping
with present government liberalization policies, private entrepreneurs are
ready to play a greater role in the construction of large housing development
projects, including low- and moderate-cost housing, which in the past have
been mainly carried out by the public sector.
2.30     Present Government policies, notably interest-rate subsidies and VAT
exemptions (para. 2.21), give CIH a competitive edge on the mortgage market.
Commercial banks mainly limit their activities in the housing sector to the
financing of construction and ensure that CIH mortgage lending is available
during the commercialization phase of the projects they support. Mortgage
lending by commercial banks to reach out to a larger clientele and enhance
competition could be a longer-term objective. Although the project does not
address these questions directly, it is designed to lay the groundwork for a
market-determined housing finance system. To this end, it focuses on
improving CIH's competitiveness and ability to mobilize resources so that it
could ultimately operate in a liberalized financial system. In particular,
the project will engage CIH in a discussion of its plans for developing
deposit and saving instruments. Broader discussion on the scope and pace of
the liberalization process and its implications on the housing finance sector,
including active participation of commercial banks in mortgage lending, are
planned in the context of a general dialogue between the Bank and the
Government on financial sector development policies. This dialogue will touch
upon issues such as selective credit policies, credit controls, and the
introduction of variable rate instruments. The liberalization of the
financial sector is expected to lead to a future Bank lending operation
involving both CIH and the commercial bank system.
HI. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
3.01     The housing sector in Morocco is characterized by sustained urban
housing demand fueled by rural migration and the decay of the existing housing
stock (paras. 2.03-2.04). Its efficient development requires increased
participation of the financial sector in housing financing to reach the higher
level (20-25%) observed in many other developing nations (paras. 2.17-2.20).
It also requires the shift of a greater share of available credit to low- and
moderate-cost housing with the resultant positive effect of decreasing the
unit costs and thus increasing the total output of housing production.
Resource mobilization for low- and moderate-cost housing will be, however,
ineffective until the Government removes the existing bottleneck in the supply
of this kind of housing through the promotion of appropriately priced land and
the establishment of more flexible building regulation and administrative
procedures (paras. 2.12 and 2.25).



- 12 -
3.02     The general purpose of the project is to widen the scope and to
improve the functioning of housing finance, with particular emphasis on credit
for low- and moderate-cost housing. To this effect, the project will pursue
the following mutually supportive objectives:
(a)    assist CIH in mobilizing resources for housing finance and in
providing loans to developers and homebuyers;
(b)    increase the relative share of credit for the production of low-
and moderate-cost housing; and
(c)    rationalize land development and housing production processes to
facilitate low- and moderate-cost housing production.
3.03     Indirectly, the project will also contribute to the liberalization of
the financial sector by enhancing CIH's ability to compete with commercial
banks in mobilizing resources and extending credit. The project will thus
ease the transition from the present specialized to a universal banking system.
B. Project Description
3.04     To achieve the above objectives, the project will provide:
(a)    a line of credit in the amount of US$77 million to CIH to
support its lending for low- and moderate-cost housing;
(b)    funds (US$0.5 million) to CIH to increase its knowledge of the
housing supply system, to develop new savings and credit
products, and to adapt its management information and audit
systems to its new depository and lending activities; and
(c)    funds (US$3 million) to the Government to carry out
institution-building programs designed to upgrade the capability
of two key ministerial departments, the Urban Directorate of MOI
and the Housing Directorate of MOH, to guide and facilitate land
and housing development.
C. Line of Credit to CUII
3.05     CIH's lending program and financial projections over the next five
years call for cumulated commitments of about US$2.7 billion; about 66% of
this will be for housing construction and mortgages, 26% for tourism
development, and 10% for commercial construction and mortgages. Based in part
on the existing pipeline of projectF. CIH projected lending for housing
construction and mortgages is expected to amount to approximately US$238
million p.a. in 1990 and 1991. The line of credit will assist CIH during the
above two-year period by refinancing a portion of its construction and
mortgage loans for low- and moderate-cost housing (para 3.06). Bank financial
assistance will represent approximately 9% of CIH's total disbursements, or
16% of disbursements against housing loans. This contribution is deemed
essential to ensure adequate levels of financing for low- and moderate-cost
housing, which tends to be neglected in favor of credit demand generated by
higher-income groups and by developers producing upmarket housing, both of
which have better access to credit.



- 13 -
3.06     Use of the Line of Credit.  The Bank loan proceeds will be used to
refinance:
(a)    Construction loans to private and public developers to build
low- and moderate-cost housing developments. Such developments
will cover the provision of site infrastructure and a mix of
housing unit types, ranging from core units (unfinished units,
including one- to two-rooms, whose completion is left to the
initiative of the owners) to walk-up apartment buildings. These
developments may include commercial and social facilities. Upon
completion of the developments (usually four years),
construction loans will be repaid and CIH will make mortgage
loans partially financed out of the construction loan repayments
available to potential buyers of the newly constructed housing
units. This conversion of funds is a key incentive to
developers to produce low- and moderate-cost housing units since
it will facilitate their sale, particularly to the low- and
moderate-income population, which has had only marginal access
to formal housing finance.
(b)    Land development loans.  Although construction loans will
include financing for land development, it is expected that
under the project, CIH will finance several land development
projects carried out by public or private developers.
(c)    Individual housing construction loans.  These loans will be
extended to individuals who desire to build their houses through
self-help or small contractors. Such credit will automatically
become mortgage loans on completion of the construction.
(d)    Mortgage loans.  These loans will apply mainly to the purchase
of new housing units built with CIH construction financing (see
(a) above). Some of the mortgage lending may be applied to new
housing units whose construction has been financed by commercial
banks.
On the basis of CIH's past experience and the existing project pipeline
(Annex 10), it is expected that about 80% of the loan proceeds will be
disbursed fcr construction loans and their consolidation into mortgages, 15%
for individual housing construction loans, and 5% for land development loans.
Procedures are in place under the Project to ensure no double financing under
the loan (which could result from financing both construction and mortgage
loans); and no financing of land out of the loan proceeds.
3.07     Subproject Eligibility Criteria.  To be eligible for Bank financing,
subprojects will have to meet the following criteria:
(a)    Price criteria.  These apply to the development of single-family
houses, attached houses, and apartment units.



- 14 -
The maximum VIT (para. 2.21) of the unit should not exceed
DH 300,000 (US$35,000). For housing developments including more
expensive units., refinancing will be limited to the qualifying
share.
(b)    Surface criteria.  This applies to the development of
residential lots for single housing units. The covered surface
of the lot chould not exceed 120 m on average. Residential
use shoulc  '.so be dominant (over 80X) and the ratio between
marketable 4nd total surfaces should be higher than 601.
(c)    Locational criteria.  All subpri,jects should be located in sites
that are properly serviced by physical and social
infrastructure; and
(d)    Financial criteria.  All subprojects whose cost exceeds
DR 20 million (US$2.3 million) should have a f4nancial rate of
returnL' equal to at least the statutory lending rate of CIH
(currently 13.51).
3.08     Beneficiary Selection Criteria.  A beneficiary of individual housing
construction or mortgage loans should meet the following conditions:
(a)    monthly income (head of household) for housing units with VIT of
less than DH 150,000 (US$17,500) should not exceed DH 3,000
(US$350) per month;
(b)    the beneficiary should not own another dwelling; and
(c)    the beneficiary should use the housing unit as his own
residence, though he may rent part of it.
The above conditions are already applied by CIH, and their enforcement has
been satisfactory. Table 5 summarizes lending targets and affordability
levels by type of housing units.

3.09     Refinancing Ratios.  To stimulate CIH's lending activity for low- and
moderate-cost housing as well as to increase the amount of resources available
for this purpose, Bank refinanciiig of CIH's loans that qualify according to
subproject and beneficiary criteria will vary according to the VIT of the
concerned housing units. In particular, Bank refinancing will take into
account the following ratios: (a) 65% of CIH loan amounts for housing units
with a VIT under DH 150,000 (US$17,500): (b) 40% for units with a VIT between
DH 150,000 and DH 300,000 (US$35,000); and (c) 50 % for land development
subprojects. These percentages effectively eliminate from Bank refinancing
the cost of land and developers markups.
3.10     Bank Review and Approval.  All subprojects benefitting from
construction sub-loans of more than US$1,000,000 equivalent will be reviewed
and approved by the Bank to ascertain that all analyses have been properly
performed. It is expected that an average of 15 projects per year will be
reviewed. CIH will maintain appropriate records of all other subprojects so
that they can be reviewed on a sample basis by Bank supervision missions. CIH
will appraise subprojects according to a computerized model that it developed
with Bank assistance under the First Housing Finance Loan.
D. Institutional Assistance to CIi
3.11     In the coming years, CIH is planning to expand substantially its
lending operations to respond to an expected greater level of housing
construction and greater recourse to credit for its financing. To reach out
to potential clientele, CIH has already extended and strengthened its branch
system. To increase its resources, it has developed deposit and savings
schemes, which are now being implemented. To improve its operations, it has
undergone a major reorganization combined with the establishment of an
integrated management information system and the implementation of
comprehensive staff training programs.-'  In addition, to meet market
demand, CIH plans to introduce new lending products to finance land
acquisition for housing construction and the purchase of existing housing
units. Z/ The implementation of these reforms needs to be carefully
monitored, gauged to CIH's actual ability to mobilize resources, and
fine-tuned to Morocco's changing financial and economic environment.
3.12     The project will assist CIH in expanding its operations and bridging
its existing gaps in research and development policies through the financing
of the following activities:
(a)    study on the characteristics of the housing supply system.  This
study will review the characteristics of the housing supply
system (e.g., types of developers, construction methods,
contracting practices, marketing systems, types of housing
products, cost structure, financing sources, payment practices)
'  CIH's corporate organization, operational performance, and development
prospects are described in Chapter IV.
2/   Mortgage loans are presently limited to the purchase of new dwellings.



- 16 -
to help CIH better adapt its lending to housing supply needs and
participate more thoroughly in the formulation of national
housing policy.  The study will include the implementation of a
survey to be carried out with a sample of developers,
contractors, and owners (for self-help construction) of new
housing units. 'the survey will have a national scope and focus
on major urban centers;
(b)    study of new lending products.  This study will review the
possible features and market potential of three new products:
(i) loans for the purchase of serviced land plots and their
self-help construction; (ii) loans for the purchase of existing
housing units; and (iil) home improvement loans. Introduction
of the first type of loan will greatly enoourage the development
of low- and moderate-cost housing for, and by, households in the
lowest income brackets. Loans for the purchase of serviced land
have already been tested in Bank-supported site and services
projects (paras. 2.26, 2.27) with positive results and marginal
banking risks. Lending for the purchase of existing homes will
ease movement within the housing stock. This is expected to
improve the overall match between household characteristics and
housing units. Finally, home improvement loans will have a
positive socio-economic impact by helping improve the standard
of living of a large segment of the urban population and
stretching the life of the housing stock. The study will help
CIH define the optimal terms and conditions of each type of
lending, quantify its potential volume, and assess its impact on
resource mobilization and use. Ultimately, the study will help
CIH prepare a promotional campaign to link these new lending
products with customized savings schemes; and
(c)    improvement of the management information and internal audit
systems. These will be adapted to CIH's new depository and
lending activities. This component will also finance related
computer equipment.
3.13     The cost of implementing the above activities is estimated at US$0.5
million. Local or foreign consulting firms will be selected from a shortlist
of, at least, six enterprises.

E. Sector Institutional Development: Assistance to MOI and MOH
3.14     Prior to 1985, MOH was responsible for both housing and urban
development. Following a government-wide reorganization, MOI became
responsible for urban development while MOH retained jurisdiction over housing
development. This organizational framework was predicated on the Government's
(decentralization) policy to link local communities and their public
utilities, under the tutelage of MOI, more closely to the urban planning
process. The potential for improvement resulting from the new organization,
however, has yet to be fully exploited, as demonstrated by the unavailability
of land for authorized housing construction. Such land shortages, which are
common to most urban centers, inflate land prices and thereby hinder the
development of low- and moderate-cost housing. In addition, land shortages
often lead to illegal housing development in peripheral areas, which are
either unsuitable for construction or too costly to connect to the urban
infrastructure network. It is estimated that these informal settlements
accommodate 15% to 20% of Morocco's urban population.  Informal settlements
generally contain sound housing units, even though they countervene
cost-efficient development of urban services. Since such units are
constructed without authorization, they do not qualify for mortgage
financing. Consequently, owner-builders often face considerable financial
hardship and are unable to complete the dwellings within a reasonable
timeframe or to improve design standards.
3.15     Land shortages could be ascribed to the following interrelated causes:
(a)    local government reluctance to issue construction permits in the
absence of homologated land-use plans;
(b)    weak coordination among local government, utility agencies, land
owners, and developers; and
(c)    local government's inability to finance the primary
infrastructure needed to open up new land to development.
3.16     The project will contribute to the solution of the first two
problems. The third problem is being tackled under an existing Municipal
Finance Loan (2272-MOR) and a similar Bank-supported operation to begin in
FY90. The land shortage issue will be addressed by supporting the preparation
of pilot urban development plans in the cities of Rabat, Tangier, Larrache,
and Ksar El-Kebir. These plans will use new preparation techniques and
approaches designed to make them more effective instruments for urban
management by reducing their preparation time and cost, increasing their
flexibility, and linking them to the actual implementation of urban
development activities. More specifically, the plans will be updated
continuously to meet the rapidly increasing demand for land and
infrastructure. Each plan calls for an implementation program that will
define the agents (i.e., municipality, utility companies, private and public
landowners and developers) responsible for the various infrastructure works,
the implementation schedule and financing plan of these works, and the
organizational, juridical, and regulatory actions required to ensure their
timely execution.  Given the importance of the legal and institutional aspects



associated with the envisaged new techniques and approaches, a special study
will specify the changes to be introduced to the present regulations,
procedures, and legislation affecting the preparation of urban master plans
and subdivision plans. In accordance with Morocco's present institutional
setting, the Urban Department of MOI will prepare the urban development plans
in close coordination with concerned municipalities, which are entrusted with
the day-to-day implementation of zoning and building regulations. Consultants
will assist in the preparation of the plans and study. The study teams will
comprise professionals from the MOI and the concerned municipalities and
utility agencies working jointly with and under the consultants' technical
responsibility.
3.17     There is a paucity of information on the housing market and
production mechanisms in Morocco. There is also a lack of documentation and
understanding of the difficulties private individuals and developers encounter
in the construction of low- and moderate-cost housing: inappropriate or
excessively strict land-use requirements, infrastructure standards, building
regulations, and architectural specifications. It is widely believed that
these constraints add substantially to construction costs and even prevent the
development of housing types specifically demanded by low-income households.
3.18     In support of the project, MOH will carry out a study to improve the
knowledge and understanding of the housing production process and system in
both the formal and informal sectors, and assess the impact of land-use,
infrastructure, and building regulations on the development cost of housing.
In addition, MOI will take appropriate action to promote changes, by the
municipalities, in the existing land subdivision and building regulations.
Special efforts will be deployed to inform local government officials on, and
sensitize them to, the results and recommendations of the study. These will
include specific measures leading to an increase in the supply of serviced
land and dwelling units for low-income, urban households.
3.19     The total implementation cost of the sectoral institutional
development program is estimated at US$3 million. Consulting firms will be
selected from shortlists of local or foreign enterprises, in accordance with
Bank guidelines for the use of consultants.

F. Lending Arrangements
3.20     The implementation of the project will involve two separate loans:
one to CIH for US$77.5 million and one to the Kingdom of Morocco for
US$3 million. Both loans will be made on standard Bank terms and conditions
for Morocco: 20 years' maturity, including five years of grace, at a variable
interest rate. CIH will use the loan proceeds to finance the construction and
acquisition of low- and moderate-cost housing on its standard lending terms
and conditions which are currently as follows:
Table 8: Beneficiaries and Terms and Conditions of Ciif's On-Lending
Type of loans              Beneficiaries         Maturity       Interest Rate
Land development loans            developers               4 years         13.5%
Housing construction loans        developers               4 years         13.5X
Self-help construction loans    individuals          Max. 25 years         12%
Mortgage loans                    individuals        Max. 25 years         127
3.21     The above lending rates were statutorily established by MOF in April
1988. These rates are substantially positive given the prevailing and
projected inflation rates (2.5% in 1988, 5% in 1989 and thereafter).  Whereas
CIH applies the statutory rates to its general lending activity, referred to
as regime g6neral, the beneficiaries of mortgages and individual construction
loans for low- and moderate-cost housing, referred to as regime sp6cial, are
charged a subsidized interest rate. The amount of subsidy is modulated
according to the value of the housing unit. It consists of 5% for housing
units with value below DH 150,000, and 2% between DH 150,000 and DH 300,000.
The interest subsidy is borne by, and paid directly to, CIH by the
Government. The recent government record of repaying CIH for interest-rate
subsidies has been poor and the Government has accumulated significant arrears
(para. 4.20).
G. Coverage of Foreig Exchange Risk
3.22     Consistent with its credit and foreign exchange control policies, to
date, the Treasury has assumed 100% of CIH's foreign exchange losses on
foreign currency borrowings effected prior to 1985 and shared losses on
subsequent borrowings. Under the sharing arrangement, established in
connection with the ITPA II Loan (June 1985) and applied to all specialized
financial institutions, CIH paid an interest rate on its foreign borrowings
equal to their actual onlending rate (e.g., 12X) reduced by a 3% spread.  The
difference between the resulting rate (i.e., 9X) and the rate carried by the
foreign loan (e.g., 8%), as well as a 1% commission charged on the relevant
subloans were deposited by CIH in a foreign exchange risk fund in the name of
the Treasury to be maintained on CIH's books and to be used to cover possible
exchange losses. In the case of insufficient funds, the additional losses



- 20 -
were assumed for an initial 2% of the currency devaluation by CIH and for the
reminder by the Treasury.
3.23     In connection with the approval of the new Bank loans to CIH and
CNCA, the Treasury has extended the ITPA II arrangement described above to the
outstanding balance of all its existing foreign borrowings, including those
contracted prior to 1985. With respect to the new Bank loan, the Treasury has
decided that the spread be reduced from 3% to 22 but that the Treasury assume
the initial 2% of Lhe currency devaluation in the case of an insufficient
foreign exchange risk fund. These arrangements are spelled out in the letter
no. 3/5187 of June 19, 1989, by the Minister of Finance to CIH's Chief
Executive Officer. The assumption by CIH of a greater share of exchange
losses on borrowings contracted prior to 1985 has only a marginal effect on
its profitability given the relatively low weight of these borrowings on CIH's
overall liabilities. Past and present arrangements also require that the
financial institutions repay their debt in full directly to foreign lenders by
purchasing the required foreign currency from BM. The Treasury later
reimburses any foreign exchange losses at its charge. Since these losses have
largely exceeded the margin between domestic and foreign interest rates, CIH
has accumulated substantial receivables from the Treasury, which could not pay
them on time because of cash shortages. Paymenu of Government arrears on
foreign exchange losses is critical to CIH's financial viability (para. 4.20).
H. Procurement and Disbursement
3.24     The line of credit to CIH will refinance civil works, goods,  and
acquisition of housing units. No contract is expected to be suitable for
international competitive bidding. Public developers will be subjected to
Government procurement practices for public works. Private developers tend to
execute construction works either by themselves or through a variety of small
contractors. In financing their projects, CIH will make sure that these
conform to appropriate cost and technical standards.
3.25     CIH's, MOI's, and MOH's institutional development programs entail the
implementation of studies and the procurement of computer equipment.
Contracts for the studies will be awarded according to Bank guidelines for the
use of consultants to qualified local and foreign consulting firms.
Procurement of equipment will be included in the contracts for studies.
3.26     The line of credit to CIH (US$77 million) is expected to be committed
over two years (1990-1991). However, to provide some leeway, the final date
for submission of subprojects to the Bank has been set at December 31, 1992.
Loans to both CIH and the Kingdom of Morocco are expected to be fully
disbursed in five years with the closing dates set at December 31, 1994. The
disbursement schedule of the loan to CIH (Annex 1, part A) is based on a
conservative assessment of the subproject pipeline eligible for Bank
refinancing and the disbursement rates observed for each lending product
during the last two years. The disbursement schedule of the loan to the
Kingdom of Morocco (Annex 1, part B) is based on a realistic estimate of the
time required to implement the studies under MOI and MOH responsibility.



- 21 -
3.27     As mentioned in para. 3.09, disbursement of the line of credit will
be made according to the following ratios: (a) 65% of CIH loans for housing
subprojects involving housing units with a VIT under DH 150,000 (US$17,500);
(b) 40% for subprojects 4avolving units with a VIT between DH 150,000 and
DH 300,000 (US$35,000); ar-d (c) 50% for land development sub-projects. The
total investment outlay supported by the line of credit, including the
contribution of CIH and its borrowers, will amount to US$351 million. Bank
financing (US$77 mrillion) will amount to 22% of the total investment and 100%
of its expected foreign exchange component. A detailed breakdown showing the
Bank contribution and participation to foreign exchange financing by lending
product is provided in Annex 2. Disbursement of institutional assistance
funds will cover 100% of the expenditures for all related activities.
3.28     Disbursements will be made against statement of expenditures (SOE)
submitted by CIH, which will list categories of sub-borrowers and the VIT of
housing units (below US$17,500, between US$17,500 and US$35,000). The
Borrower will retain all documentation to support SOE and disbursement
requests and will keep a record of all expenditures for review by CIH's
auditors and Bank supervision missions.
I. Supervision
3.29     Project supervision will require about 35 staff-weeks over the three
years of project implementation. The basic staff required will include a
financial analyst and an urban planner/engineer.
X. THE MA[N LOAN BENEFICIARY
A. Organization
4.01     Since 1920, CIH has operated as a private company subject to
corporate law, although its major shareholders, CDG and BM, are public
entities. Its organization comprises the following departments: Financial
Resources, Accounting, Operations, Network Management, Human Resources, and
Research (Annex 3). In 1982, CIH underwent decentralization in response to
the Government's policy of using it as a main conduit for low- and
moderate-cost housing. At present, CIH has 18 regional branch offices,
referred to as agences. The staffing complement increased from 250 in 1979 to
390 in 1982, and to approximately 550 in 1987. Staff generally deal with both
hotel and housing projects and loans. This situation broadens their exposure
to technical aspects. The quality of CIH's management is good. CIH's
Statute, updated in December 1988, and policy statement, integrated with
annual provisions by its Board of Directors, are consonant with Bank lending
policies.
B. Management and Operations
4.02     CIH has developed a sophisticated data set on construction costs and
building standards. It also has a good feel for housing market conditions
throughout the country. Developers requesting financial assistance from CIH
submit proposals detailing the technical, legal, financial, and commmercial



- 22 -
aspects of their planned projects. Preliminary evaluation by CIH consists of
an assessment of a developer's financial status, its experience in similar
projects, and the various guarantees and collateral it is offering to back up
requested loans. Once CIH determines that a developer is acceptable, a team
of CIH appraisers reviews the proposal. Appraisal teams are staffed with
engineers, architects, and financial analysts. Following such review, CIH
submits its comments to developers, usually recommending changes or further
analysis. After discussing its recommendations directly with the developers,
CIH issues an appraisal report covering key project features and CIH's
recommendations concerning the loan amount, loan maturity, and conditions to
be met prior to loan approval. The report also contains a series of project
documents, such as building plans, land documents, and building permits. A
Technical Committee comprising the main department heads then reviews the
report and recommends approval or rejection of the loan. The average time
between pre-appraisal and final approval is two to three months.
4.03     CIH appraisers pay close attention to economic analysis and to
advising developers on project concept and design. Institutional development
and training components of previous Bank loans were designed to strengthen
CIH's appraisal capacity and reinforce its advisory role.
4.04     The proceeds of CIH's construction and land development loans are
made available in three installments to individuals and in four installments
to developers. The fourth installment to developers, amounting to 10% of the
loan, is withheld pending completion of the work. Funds are disbursed only
after CIH has made a field inspection to ensure that the portion of the
investment to be financed with the borrower's equity has been completed.
Subsequent inspections are made to ensure that each CIH loan installment has
been utilized in accordance with the loan contract and the project appraisal
report. In case of non-compliance with the agreed project design,
disbursements are suspended until the issue is resolved to the satisfaction of
CIH.
4.05     The proceeds of mortgage loans are made to developers and
individuals. The proceeds of construction loans to developers are
consolidated into individual mortgage loans, which offset developers' debt to
CIH.  In the interest of preserving its creditworthiness, CIH has agreed to
maintain its financial exposure in any single operation at 207 of its equity
and reserves, unless the Government or any institution acceptable to the Bank
guarantees to cover CIH's full credit risk.
4.06     Once projects have been completed and the housing units sold to the
ultimate beneficiaries, CIH randomly checks on units benefitting from interest
subsidies to ensure that these are being used exclusively as borrowers'
principal residences and are therefore not being let. Whenever there is a
breach in these rules, CIH requires the borrower to reimburse all interest
subsidies received and to pay the statutory rate on the principal of the loan
still outstanding. The proceeds of reimbursed interest subsidies are returned
to the Government and credited against interest subsidies due to CIH. Owing
to the size of its housing portfolio, CIH cannot possibly audit all
beneficiaries. Nonetheless, its follow-up procedures serve as a deterrent,
and few violations have been reported so far.



- 23 -
4.07     CIH also monitors its customers' debt service closely.  It issues
monthly statements defining the aging of loans. After payments are six months
late and a loan is declared in default, it is assigned to a special unit that
takes appropriate measures to recover the debt. These procedures are
consistent with standard banking practices.
4.08     CIH mobilizes deposits and savings through its branch offices.  A
central department in Casablanca, in charge of the branches, defines their
operational policies. To date CIH has started raising sight deposits only.
This activity places it in competition with commercial banks on a tight
market, which requires extensive and costly banking services. It also
provides commercial banks with a strong argufent to oppose present Government
regulations requiring their support for housing either by direct lending to
the sector, or by purchase of CIH medium-term bonds (para. 2.19). It is
essential that CIH extend its resource mobilization by setting up housing
savings schemes. This is the area in which CIH, as a specialized housing
bank, can show competitive strength. The mobilization of savings linked to
the purchase of homes is also expected to add resources to the financial
market rather than diluting existing bank deposits.
C. Operational and Financial Performance

calendar years is detailed below:

4.10     During the past three years (1986-88), CIH approved US$483 million in
loans, financing 40,500 housing units. Loans to developers for construction
projects ca-ry maturities of four years. In principle, CIH can finance up to
100% of estimated construction costs, excluding land. Effective financing,
however, rarely exceeds 60% of actual project costs owing to conservative
estimates by CIH appraisers. Mortgage loans carry maturities of 15 years or
less and cover 75% of the purchase price of the housing unit. However, when
the VIT of a unit does not exceed DH 150,000 (US$17,500), loan maturity can be
extended to 25 years and financing may cover as much as 90% of the purchase

price. There is a maximum grace period of six months on such loans. Land
development loans cover up to 100% of estimated costs of civil works. These
are repaid according to the progress of sales over a maximum period of four
years.
4.11     Hotel loans finance the construction, equipment, and expansion of
hotels ranging from one-star to luxury hotels. These carry maturities of up
to 20 years for buildings, including a three-year grace period, and up to ten
years for equipment, with a one-year grace period. CIH currently charges
13.5% for hotel loans.
4.12     In 1979, CIH began a policy of systematic divestiture of its equity
investments to improve the overall quality of its investment portfolio. Since
then, it has taken new equity participations only in response to the
restructuring needs of some critical projects, particularly in the tourism
sector. In the future, CIH expects to limit its equity participations in an
effort to free up resources for its lending operations, which should improve
its overall profitability.
4.13     Summary audited income statements and balance sheets for FY 1984-88
are shown in Annexes 4 and 5. Financial indicators are presented in the
Table 10.
4.14     Analysis of the above data shows that CIH had good financial
performance during the last five years. In 1988, total revenues amounted to
DH 1,061 million (US$123 million), a 247 increase over 1987. Net profit
before taxes amounted to DH 54 million (US$17.2 million). However, the
analysis of critical performance indicators shows some signs of deterioration.
The spread between the cost of borrowings and earnings from loans narrowed to
2.2% in 1988 from 2.7% in 1984.  The current ratio decreased to 1.4 in 1988
from 2.0 in 1984. The debt/equity and debt-service coverage ratios moved to
13.3:1 and 1.13 at the end of 1988 from 10.9:1 and 1.19 in 1984. Although
this represents a negative trend line, better than expected profitability in
1988 coupled with the new deposit schemes and heavier concentration on lending
to developers, should enable CIH to expand its lending activities (paras.
4.18-4.19). Projected financial indicators from 1989 to 1994 are presented in
Annex 6.
4.15     To ensure CIH's efficient operations and improve its financial
position, CIH agreed, during loan negotiations, to maintain:
(a)    at least a 2.2% spread;
(b)    operating expenses at no more than 1.3% of average total assets;
(c)    a debt/equity ratio below 15;
(d)    a equity to total assets ratio of at least 1:18;
(e)    a liquidity ratio on sight deposits higher than 20X; and
(f)    a maximum exposure of 20% on any subproject.

4.16     A definition of the performance indicators presented above is
provided in Annex 7. At CIR's request, part of the provisions for losses on
the loan portfolio in default will be included as "quasi equity" in the
calculation of the debt/equity ratio. The share of provisions to be
considered as "quasi equity" will be determined on the basis of an annual
assessment of the risk of CIH loans in default. This assessment will be
carried out in conjunction with CIH's annual audit by independant auditors
acceptable to the Bank.

D. Status of Loan Portfolio
4.17     As of December 31, 1988, CIH's housing portfolio represented 67% of
its total portfolio.-'  Arrears in principal and interest of over six months
on the housing loan portfolio amounted to DH 59.2 million (US$6.9 million) as
of December 31, 1988, or 2% of the housing portfolio. These arrears present
no special risks because the aggregate VIT on CIH's mortgage portfolio far
exceeds any risk of loss on these loans. It is unlikely that CIH's lending
operations in low- and moderate-cost housing will have an adverse effect on
its housing portfolio. Experience in developing and developed countries shows
that there is no special repayment risk attached to granting housing loans to
low-income groups. On the other hand, CIH's hotel and tourism portfolio
affected by arrears represented 11% of the total outstanding balance of that
portfolio in 1988. The status of CIH's hotel and tourism portfolio has
improved during the last two years, as a result of more careful follow-up.
CIH's provisions for loans in default conservatively amounted to DH 157
million (US$18.2 million) at the end of 1988, or 52% of total arrears.

E. Prospects for Future Growth and Financial Performance
4.18     Under its present institutional setup (para. 4.01) CIH can manage
increased lending activity. CIH projected lending operations and the pipeline
of subprojects sponsored by public developers (Annexes 8, 9, and 10) show an
increase in total volume of lending from DH 2.6 billion in 1989 to
DH 6.5 billion in 19C4.  In the face of increased lending, CIH is prepared to
I/       Excluding short-term loans to developers.



- 27 -
adjust its operations to: (a) achieve a more favorable balance between
long-term mortgage loans to individuals and medium-term loans to developers;
(b) offset foreseeable liquidity problems; and (c) cover the higher cost of
long-term borrowing due to the elimination of BM rediscounts. This portfolio
restructuring will entail a continued shift away from lending for hotels and
tourism towards lending for housing, particularly for low-income units.
Resources mobilized through sight and term deposits are expected to help
offset the higher cost of borrowing and lower margins resulting from reduced
statutory lending rates. Financial projections (Annexes 11, 12, and 13),
prepared by the appraisal mission and updated prior to negotiations, indicate
that CIH can maintain its profitability and a sound financial position.
Sensitivity tests of the annual return on CIH's operations, i.e., spread, show
that this return is significantly affected by decreases in lending and only
marginally affected by decreases in deposits. In particular, if the lending
targets were reduced by half to 9% p.a. on average, instead of the projected
18X, and the growth of deposits were to remain stable at 252 p.a. on average,
the return would decrease by approximately 30%; if deposits were to grow at 5%
p.a. and lending were to remain stable, the return would drop only 10%. This
is because CIH's lending growth is expected to consist mainly in commercial
loans, which have a more favorable spread and cash turnover, whereas deposits
represent a limited, albeit profitable, source of funding. The table below
summarizes cash-flow projections for 1989-94.

to US$2,494 million for 1989-1994.  Identified resources will cover 862 of



- 28 -
the financial needs. Although the amounts to be borrowed annually from the
domestic market have not yet been fully determined, the absorptive capacity of
this market is limited. CIH will likely have to borrow internationally, in
addition to the Bank loan.
F. Accounts Receivable to Government Transfers and Hotel Arrears
4.20     Under present arrangements, the Treasury assumes the bulk of the
foreign exchange risk (paras 3.22 and 3.23). Due to the rapid depreciation of
the Dirham in relation to creditors' hard currencies, financial institutions
have incurred substantial exchange losses. The Treasury has been unable to
keep up with reimbursements, and in the case of CIH, has accumulated arrears
that, at the time of project appraisal in July 1988, reached the amount of
DH 234 million (US$27 million). By the same token, the Treasury has been
unable to honor its obligations in a timely manner on the account of
interest-rate subsidies (para. 2.21) and has accumulated arrears for
DH 265 million (US$31 million) at the same time. In addition, previous
agreements between the Government and CIH to settle loan payment arrears on
CIIH loans for state-owned hotels were yet to be fulfilled, and there was a
total residual amount of DH 147 million (US$17 million).
4.21     The perpetuation of the above receivable on CIH's cash flow generates
a substantial loss in profitability due to the high cost of having to borrow
on a short-term basis to compensate for these delayed revenues. Moreover, the
Government does not pay interest on arrears. MOF is aware of such a situation
and is committed to remedying it. Since project appraisal, MOF has settled or
agreed to settle its arrears as follows:
(a)   Foreign Exchange Losses.  The amount settled totals DH 314 million,
of which DH 104 million were paid in cash and the remaining DH 207
million in Treasury bonds carrying a five-year maturity and a 6%
interest rate. Pending arrears to the end of 1988, in the amount of
DH 70 million, will be settled by December 31, 1989, either cash or
with Treasury bonds;
(b)   Interest-Rate Subsidies.  The amount settled totals DH 251 million,
of which DH 96 million has already been paid in cash and the
remaining DH 155 million has been money-ordered. Pending arrears to
the end of 1988, in the amount of approximately DH 180 million, will
be settled by December 31, 1989, through Treasury bonds carrying a
five-year maturity and a 82 interest rate; and
(c)   Loans to State-Owned Hotels.  Pending arrears mainly concern the
Hyatt Regency hotel for a total amount of DH 100 million. The
Treasury will settle these arrears by December 31, 1989, either in
cash or with bonds.
4.22     Government arrangements to settle pending arrears to CIH were
confirmed in a telex (June 22, 1989) sent by the General Director of the
Treasury to CIH's Chief Executive Officer.

V. PROJECT BENEFITS. RISKS AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
A. Project Benefits
5.01     Morocco's housing supply system is strongly biased towards the
production of high standard homes which are considered more profitable and
relatively easy to market. By the same token, the credit system favors the
buyers of more expensive homes, who are more affluent and therefore considered
more creditworthy. This bias promotes unwarranted overinvestment. It also
ignores the savings capacity of low-income households for housing, as
substantiated by the yearly construction of thousands of unauthorized
dwellings on the outskirts of major urban areas.
5.02     By providing credit for financing the development of some 15,000 low-
and moderate-cost housing units over a two-year period, the project will
contribute to relieving the housing shortage in major urban areas, promote
homeownership by low- and moderate-income households, and redirect part of the
domestic funds available for housing finance towards more cost-effective types
of contruction. Besides the noticeable social benefits, shifting housing
production towards affordable standards will meet high-volume demand resulting
from demographic pressure while containing investment. The latter benefit has
a positive macroeconomic impact since it frees up resources for other
productive activities.
5.03     Provision of credit under the project will be associated with
institutional development aimed at improving CIH's ability to mobilize
resources for housing finance and to plan its future lending activity.
Resource mobilization through an appropriate housing savings scheme will raise
the contribution of formal credit to housing finance to levels substantially
highier than the present 15X.  Since the construction and purchase of many
homes are made with cash that is often kept out of the financial system, the
above savings scheme is expected to recycle cash into the housing sector with
unpredictable multiplier effects. Bank assistance to CIH will also come at a
critical juncture for the institution. Its growth objectives to meet the
financing needs of the housing sector faces important challenges related to
its resource structure and requirements, its profitability, its recovery of
Government arrears on foreign exchange risk losses and interest-rate
subsidies, and its relationship with the commercial banking system. Continued
Bank assistance to CII through the supervision dialogue and the studies under
the project will help the institution to synchronize its organizational growth
and expanded lending activity with sectoral development policies and resource
mobilization.
5.04     As described in para. 3.14, housing production, in particular for
low- and moderate-income households, is constrained institutionally and
organizationally at the local government level. Ultimately, the issues will
focus on ways to make municipalities more dynamic and to coordinate their
actions with those of public utilities, landowners, and land developers. Such
issues must be addressed before land for housing construction can be mobilized
and provided with necessary infrastructure in a timely and efficient manner.
MOI, as the Central Government entity responsible for local communities and



- 30 -
corresponding utility agencies, has a unique role in ensuring the achievement
of the above objective. The project will assist MOI to this effect as well as
promote cooperation between it and MOH to deal with the technical aspects of
housing development.
5.05     In view of the nature of the loan, which mainly consists of a line of
credit to a financial intermediary, estimating a project ERR would prove
unreliable. The ERRs computed for a sample of 10 subprojects financed under
the First Housing Finance Loan range from 15% to 20X. It is expected that
ERRs of subprojects financed under the new loan will be in the same range and,
therefore, well above the opportunity cost of capital (para. 3.07).
B. Project Risks
5.06     There are three main risks under the project.  The first is related
to the type of housing subprojects that will be actually financed. The
project will channel about 50% of Bank financial assistance to the financing
of housing units with VITs of less than DH 150,000 (US$17,500), with the
remaining funds used for housing units valued between DH 150,000 and
DH 300,000 (US$35,000). CIH, however, will be unable to achieve that
objective without an adequate demand for credit. The project will mitigate
this risk through institutional development programs, in particular the one
designed to promote availability of affordable serviced land for low- and
moderate-cost housing. CIH's planned housing savings scheme will provide
greater insight into the savings capacity, and thus creditworthiness, of
low-income households. It will thus allow CIH to adopt more flexible lending
criteria rather than those based exclusively on the official earnings of the
household head.
5.07     The second risk is related to the possibility that CIH's future
lending operations and profitability may be limited by Morocco's tight
financial market characterized by the rising cost of long-term resources, and
due to Government inability to prevent new arrears on its payments of
interest-rate subsidies. This risk could be minimized through effective
project supervision to ensure compliance with financial covenants and
Government guarantees relating to its transfers to CIH.
5.08     The third risk is the capacity of MOI and MOH to manage their
respective institutional development programs. Both Ministries have recently
undergone reorganization of their departments dealing with urban and housing
development and are adapting to the Government's new decentralization policies
(para. 3.14). Careful selection of external consultants to assist in
preparing the studies envisaged under the project, and the effective
participation of central and local government staff in these studies, will
enhance the prospects of a successful implementation of the project components.
C. Project Environmental hnpact
5.09     The construction of residential buildings and housing units financed
under the project is expected to be carried out according to appropriate urban
planning, architectural, and engineering standards. Consequently, it will not
have a negative environmental impact. In addition, increased lending for low-
and moderate-cost housing associated with measures to increase the supply of
serviced residential land will help integrate part of the presently
unauthorized housing production into the formal sector.

This, in turn, will help control urban sprawl, as well as unsafe housing
development (i.e., lack of sanitary facilities and basic infrastructure). The
project will, therefore, have a positive environmental impact.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01     During negotiations agreements were reached on the following points
and recorded in the loan documents:
-   project objectives and description (paras. 3.02-3.09);
-   project monitoring and reporting requirements (para. 3.10);
-   CIH's financial performance indicators (para. 4.15);
-   studies financed under the project and their schedules (paras.
3.12-3.13 and 3.15-3.19); and
-   settlement to CIH, by the Government (Treasury), of pending arrears
for foreign exchange losses on international borrowings, interest-rate
subsidies, and loans in default on state-owned hotels (para. 4.21).
6.02     Given the above agreements, the project is suitable for a Bank loan
of US$77.5 million to CIH, with the Guarantee of the Kingdom of Morocco, and
US$3 million to the Kingdom of Morocco, with terms of 20 years, including
five-year grace periods.
