MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF US$3 MILLION
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
AND US$77.5 MILLION TO THE CREDIT IMMOBILIER ET HOTELIER
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A SECOND HOUSING FINANCE PROJECT
1.       Submitted for approval is the following memorandum on proposed loans
to the Kingdom of Morocco, ia an amount equivalent to US$3 million, and to the
Credit Immobilier et H6telier (CIH), in an amount equivalent to us$ 77.5
million, to assist in the implementation oE a housing finance project. Both
loans will be repayable over 20 years with five years of grace at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate.
2.       Background.  Morocco's urban population has increased rapidly over
the past three decades, expanding from 292 of the total population in 1960 to
45X in 1986, at an annual growth rate of 4.5%, significantly above the ovterall
populatioingrowth rate of 2.6% p.a. During the last ten years. this rapid
urbanization has taken place in the context of a difficult economic
situation. Severe budgetary and balance of payments deficits, compounded by
the stagnation in real income, have limited significantly the capacity of the
public and private sectors to respond to the housing, infrastructure, and
service needs of an increasing number of urban dwellers. The housing shortage
is particularly acute for low-income households. Overcrowding, shared
dwellings, and shanty towns are visible consequences and adversely affect
health and sanitary conditions, social stability, and economic development.
During the last five years, housing production averaged 72,000 units p.a.,
considerably fewer than the 90,000 units required to meet new demand,
notwithstanding the need to replace substandard housing. Mortgage lending
financed only 152 of the related capital investment, less than in most
developing countries. Moreover, such financing disproportionately benefits
medium- and upper-income households.
3.       CIH is the primary mortgage lender.  Commercial banks primarily
finance construction loans with maturities of two to three years. They
participate, however, in funding mortgage lending, since the Government
requires that they earmark at least 6% of their deposits for either making
mortgage loans or purchasing medium-term securities issued by CIH. Commercial
banks prefer the latter alternative because of credit ceilings on their
overall lending. The sale of these securities became the main source of CIH's
liabilities, when Central Bank rediscounts were discontinued in 1986. The
situation will change as a result of the recent government decisions to allow
CIH, as we'l as all other specialized credit institutions, to mobilize savings
directly from the public and to relax the existing credit ceilings on
commercial bank lending. The limited participation of the financial sector in
the funding of housing investment is the result of Morocco's tight financial
market, combined with excessive Treasury demand for credit. The
disproportionate amount of lending to medium- and upper-income households is
the result of the competitive edge these households have in gaining access to
credit as well as the fact that many low- and moderate-cost housing units are
built without authorization, which excludes them from mortgage financing.



- a-
4.       The efficient development of housing and the progressive eliminatlon
of housing shortages call for a greater financial Intermediation role in the
sector together with an expansion of the credlt to be made available for low-
and moderate-cost units. Further resource mobillzation for low- and
moderate-coot housing, however, will be ineffective until the Government
removes existing bottlenecks in its supply and promotes the absorption of
unauthorized housing into the formal sector by adapting present construction
standards to the financial capabilities of low-income houeholds and by easing
land development.
5,*      Proleot Ob,ectives.  The project will broaden the scope and improve
the functioning of housing finance, as well as rationalize land and housing
supply, with particular emphasis on low- and moderate-cost housing. The first
objective will be achieved by helping CIE mobilize resources and strengthen
its ability to channel them to these two categories of housiang; the second by
helping the key ministerial departuients involved in the housing sector foster
the development of appropriately priced construction sites and housing units.
The project will also lay the groundwork for a progressive transition from the
present specialized banking system to a universal one. To this end, it
focuses on improving CIH's competitiveness and ability to mobllize resources,
so that it can fulfill its mandate effectively in a morket-determined
onvironment.
6.       Proleot DesoRLton.  To achieve the above objectives, the project
will:
(a) support low- and moderate-cost housing constructLon through a
line of credit of US$ 77 million equivalent; and
(b) strengthen institutions Involved In the housing sector by
providing funds in the amount of US$3.5 million for technical
assistance.
7.       CIH will be the beneficiary of both the line of credit and
institutional development funds for a total amount of US$77.5 million. it
will use the proceeds of the line of credit to refinance: (a) construction
loans to private and public developers to build low- and moderate-cost housing
units; (b) land development projects carried out by public or private
developers; (c) individual housing construction loans; and (d) mortgage loans
for the purchase of new housing units. To qualify for Bank refinancing,
subprojects will have to meet specific criteria related to the price and size
of housing units; they must also have PRRs of at least 13.5%, corresponding to
the current statutory interest rate on construction loans. CIH will use the
institutional development funds (US$0.5 million), first, to improve its
knowledge of the housing supply system to better adapt its lending to housing
supply needs; second, to assess the possible features, market potential, and
impact on its operations of extending its lending to home improvement
projects, the purchase of existing housing units, and the purchase of serviced
plots; and third, to Adapt its management information and internal audit
systems to its new depository and lending activities, including the
acquisition of related computer equipment.
8.       The Urban Directorate of the Ministry of Interior (MOI) and the
Housing Directorate of the Ministry of Housing (MOR) will be the beneficiaries
of the remaining funds for institutional development (US$3 million). These



- 3 -
funds will be used for institution-building programs aimed at upgrading their
capability to guide and facilitate land and housing development. The MOI
program will promote improvements in existing approaches, procedures, and the
regulatory system affecting the preparation of urban master plans and land
subdivision plans, which in turn affect the supply of serviced land and
housing. The MOH program will improve the knowledge and understanding of the
housing production process and system in both the formal and informal sectors,
as well as assess the impact of land-use, infrastructural, and building
regulations on the development cost of housing and the modifications required
to foster low- and moderate-cost housing development.
9.       Project implementation, comprising commitment of the line of credit
to CIH and execution of the institution-building programs, is expected to take
three years from loan effectiveness; full disbursement of Bank loan proceeds,
five years. A breakdown of the estimated project costs and financing sources
is presented in Schedule A; procurement and disbursement information in
Schedule B; timetable of key project processing events in Schedule C; and the
status of Bank Group Operations in Morocco in Schedule D. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 7431-MOR, dated July 31, 1989, is being distributed separately.
10.      Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project continues the Bank's
support to housing and urban development in Morocco. This has already
resulted in three lending operations: the first two for urban renewal and the
construction of sites and services, and the third for the financing of low-
and moderate-cost housing by CIH.  The project will further support CIH
lending for low- and moderate-cost housing while addressing critical issues
related to housing development and future CIB operations. It comes at a
critical time, when the Government is discussing ways and means to promote a
more dynamic role for local authorities and public agencies in the development
of serviced land and low- and moderate-cost housing.   In keeping with present
Government liberalization policies, local entrepreneurs are ready to play a
greater role in the construction of large housing development projects,
including low- and moderate-cost housing. In the financial sector, the
Government is seeking to simplify the regulatory framework, reduce distortions
and foster competition. CIH has been authorized to engage in commercial
banking activities and is developing new deposit products and saving schemes
to finance land and kiome acquisition. The commercial banks mainly finance
construction and rely on CIH mortgage lending to ease the commercialization of
the projects they support. While helping CIH mobilize new resources and
harmonize its lending activities with recent developments in the financial
sector, the project constitutes a major vehicle with which to pursue a broader
dialogue between the Bank and the Government on the issues of specialized
banking, credit controls, selective credit policies, and variable rate
instruments.  Ultimately, the project is expected to lead to a future Bank
housing finance operation involving both CIH and the commercial banking system.
11.      Lending Arrangements.  The implementation of the project involves
two separate loans: one to CIH for US$77.5 million and one to the Kingdom of
Morocco for US$3 million. Both loans will be made on standard Bank terms and
conditions for Morocco: 20 years' maturity, including five years of grace, at
the standard variable interest rate. CIH will use the loan proceeds to
refinance subloans for the construction and acquisition of low- and



moderate-cost housing. These subloans will be made on ClI's standard terms
and conditions; the lcnding rates are those established by MOF in April 1988,
(i.e., 13.5% for land develcpment and construction loans and 12% for
mortgages, including individual construction loans). These rates are well
above present and projected inflation (2.52 in 1988 and 52 thereafter).
Maturities on loans for land development and construction are up to four years
with balloon payments; those on mortgages and individual construction loans
can reach 25 years but generally do not exceed 20 years. Low-income
households granted mortgages and individual construction loans for low- and
moderate-cost housing units below US$35,000, are charged subsidized interest
rates varying from 72 to 101 according to the appraised real estate value of
the unit. The interest subsidy is borne by the Government and paid directly
to CIH.  Bank refinancing of CIH lending will amount to 651 of subloans for
the housing units with maximum value less than the equivalent of DS 150,000
(US$17,500), 401 of suSloans for units with a value between DR 150,000 and
DU 300,000 (US$17,500 and US$35,000), and 502 of subloans for land
improvement. About 80% of the loan proceeds is expected to be disbursed for
construction loans to developers to be later consolidated into mortgages, 151
for individual construction loans for new housing units, and 5% for land
development. The loan to CIH will also finance 100l of the cost of the
studies to be carried out under the project. The loan to the Kingdom of
Morocco will cover 100% of the cost of studies underpinning institutional
development in MOI and MOH.
12.      AEreed Actions.  CIH, MOI, and MOH will implement their respective
project components in compliance with the objectives, conditlons and schedules
described in this memorandum and the Staff Appraisal Report, and reflected in
the loan documents.
13.      In addition. CIH ani the Government have agreed on the following
actions:
(a)  CIH will continue to maintain sound financial policies and meet
agreed upon targets of capital adequacy, liquidity,
profitability, operating expenditures, and loan exposure;
b)   the Government wil, settle its remaining arrears to CIH for
foreign exchange losses, interest-rate subsidies, and
government-owned hotel loans in default by December 31, 1989; and
c)   the Government will share the foreign exchange risk on the Bank
loan to CIH according to arrangements agreed upon with CIE in
June 1989, which were found satisfactory to the Bank.
13.      Justification.  By providing CIH with credit for financing the
construction and purchase of about 15,000 low- and moderate-cost housing units
over a two-year period, the project will contribute to relieving the housing
shortage in major urban areas, to promoting homeownership by low- and
moderate-income households, and to redirecting part of the domestic funds
available for housing finance towards more cost-effective types of
construction. Bank assistance to CIH will also come at a critical juncture
for the institution. Its growth objectives to meet the financing needs of the
housing sector face important challenges related to its resource structure and
requirements, its profitability, the recovery of Government arrears for
foreign exchange risk losses and interest-rate subsidies, and its relationship



with the commercial banking system. Continued Bank assistance to CIH will
help the institution synchronize its organizational growth and expanded
lending activity with appropriate sectoral development and resource
mobilization policies. By supporting institutiont development in MOI and
MOH, the project will facilitate coordination among local authoritiea, util.ity
agencies, landowners, and developers for the production of affordable serviced
land and housing. This will have a positive environmental impact by limiting
the proliferation of unauthorized housing on unserviced land.
14.      Risks.  There are three main risks tinder the project.  The first is
related to the type of housing subprojects that will be actually financed.
The project is expected to channel about 502 of Baink financial assistance to
the development of low- and moderate-cost housing with a real estate value of
less than US$17,500. CIH, however, will be unable to reach that objective in
the absence of an adequate supply of low- and moderate-cost housing. To
mitigate this risk, the project supports institutional development programs
designed to ease present constraints to the construction of low- and
moderate-cost housing, and the promotion of developers' activity in this
field. The second risk is related to the possibility that CIH's future
lending operations and profitability may be adversely affected by Morocco's
tight financial market and rising cost of long-term resources and by the
Treasury's inability to reimburse CIH for advances it has made for
interest-rate subsidies. This risk can be minimized through effective project
supervision to ensure CIH compliance with the financial covenants set forth in
the loan agreement and Government respect of its financial commitments
vis-a-vis of CIH. Recent fiscal reform programs will ease this governme;.t
task by yielding greater revenues. The third risk is the capacity of MOI and
MOH to manage their respective institutional development programs. Both
Ministries have recently undergone reorganization of their departments dealing
with housing and urban development and are adapting to the new government
decentralization policies. Bank advice during the execution of the envisaged
programs will enhance the prospects of successful implementation.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the loans will comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Board of
Directors approve them.
