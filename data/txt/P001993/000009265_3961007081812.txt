MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF NIGER
FOR THE PUBLIC WORKS AND EMPLOYMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
supplemental credit to the Republic of Niger for SDR 6.9 million, the equivalent of US$10 million,
on standard IDA terms, to complement the Public Works and Employment Project (Cr. 2209-NIR).
The proposed supplemental credit would consist of an addition of funds to the public works
component. It complements the Economic Recovery Credit (Cr. 2581-NIR) that was approved by the
Board on March 29, 1994.
2.    The main objective of the original Project was to create employment in response to the
serious levels of urban poverty in Niger's cities. The devaluation of the CFA franc resulted in a
substantial short-term increase in urban poverty that can be expected to persist until the supply
response to the de-aluation materializes (see para. 10). Thus there is an urgent need to create more
short-term employment to alleviate the transitional effects of the devaluation. Fortunately, a reserve
set of economically justified subprojects had already been identified in the context of the Project.
The Government has shown strong commitment to the Project which the executing agency is
implementing with remarkable diligence and efficiency (see paras. 4-5). However, due to short-term
budget constraints, the Government is unable to mobilize external financing from other donors in a
timely manner. Hence, it was decided to pursue the proposed supplemental credit as the most
appropriate vehicle for the Bank to respond to the Government's request for assistance.
Background: Public Works and Employment Project
3.    Project Objectives and Description.  The Public Works and Employment Project was
approved on February 19, 1991 and became effective on December 9, 1991. Its objectives are: (a)
to create, at least temporarily, substantial new employment in urban areas as rapidly as possible
using the private sector; (b) to improve, through the execution of works financed by the Project, the
individual skills of the workers employed and the corporate competitiveness of the firms carrying out
works; (c) to demonstrate the feasibility of labor-intensive projects; and (d) to review existing public
works programs and recast them with the intent of speeding up their implementation and overall
performance. The Project's five components consist of: (a) a program of public facility and
infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance in urban areas; (b) a package of services related to work
organization, management, and labor force training; (c) a supervision and monitoring component in
order to closely monitor the Project; (d) a selective audit of pubic works programs to identify
bottlenecks and design system improvements; and (e) a package of consultant services related to a
training program for beneficiaries and engineering firms, and a program aimed at increasing
community participation in urban infrastructure maintenance.
4.    Implementation Experience. The Project is being implemented by an executing agency called
"NIGETIP" or Agence Nigerienne de Travaux d'7ntgr&t Public pour l'Emploi, which was created to
provide urban infrastructure rehabilitation through "delegated contract management" on behalf of
municipalities and Government. Delegated contract management has enabled NIGETIP to efficiently
manage a large number of small contracts, thus avoiding any increase in civil service employment.
Competitive bidding, even for small contracts, ensured the efficient use of resources (construction



- 2 -
costs were often lower than budgeted). During the two years of implementation, NIGETIP has
executed works for approximately US$10 million per year (at tne exchange rate prevailing at that
time). As of February 28, 1994, NIGETIP had committed all the resources allocated for the civil
works component and had disbursed approximately 83 % of the Credit proceeds.
5.    NIGETIP's performance has been outstanding at all levels: two years after effectiveness,
200 sub-projects have been or are being executed by 60 small contractors for a total cost of CFAF 5
billion, in the eight departments of the Republic of Niger. Total wages distributed by the 107
subprojects already completed represent CFAF 796,662,314 or an average of CFAF 44,775 per job
created. The wage bill represents 29% of total investment costs. a higher proportion than expected.
The execution of the sub-projects led to the creation of 800,687 person-days of temporary work, i.e.,
17,793 persons were employed in jobs for an average duration of 45 days. Finally, with an overhead
cost of less than 5%, NIGETIP has proved to be very efficient in managing small contracts
(approximately 250 per year, half for works and half for consulting services) and has been able to
pay contractors and consultants within a week. Audits are routinely on time and unqualified.
Counterpart funding had been problematic but Government is currently in compliance with all major
covenants.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
6.    Changing Country Economic Background/Rationalefor Project Expansion. Niger's economy
remains relatively undiversified with only one major export commodity, uranium, and limited natural
resources. Since the downturn of its uranium prices in 1981, the economy of Niger has suffered
continual setbacks, mainly as a result of the deterioration in its terms of trade, the continual
depreciation of the naira of Nigeria since 1986, poor economic management, as well as recurrent
droughts. Over the period 1985-92, real GDP growth has remained very low, on average 0.25%.
Per capita income has declined by 3.4% per year since 1980 and as a result, Niger's fast growing
population (3.2%) is becoming one of the poorest of the world.
7.    In the period 1985-89, GON, with the support of IDA and the IMF, implemented reforms to
improve public finance and debt management, liberalize the economy and foreign trade, reduce
constrains on pricing and mnarketing in agriculture, strengthen the programming and implementation
of public investment, restructure the public enterprise sector, rehabilitate the banking system and
improve financial intermediation.  Significant progress was achieved in these areas, however
economic conditions continued to deteriorate and the underlying decreasing competitiveness was
compounded by adverse shocks. In parallel, the political situation evolved and the long transition
period until the installation of a democratic government in April 1993 caused the structural
adjustment program to derail.
8.    In 1992 and 1993, the fiscal position worsened and substantial domestic and external
payments arrears accumulated.  In order to curb this deterioration, the authorities adopted a
strengthened internal adjustment program in August 1993 and took key measures in September,
including a decrease in public sector wages as well as piecemeal protection measures against
fraudulent imports. Despite these measures, the fiscal imbalances continued. External debt servicing
fell to a minimum, and counterpart funds for foreign financed projects declined, resulting in
excessively low levels of public investment. The balance of payments current account deficit,



-3 -
excluding official transfers remained at 7.5% of GDP in 1993, as in the previous two years.
9.     Taking into account changes in the external environment as well as economic and financial
development in Niger, the authorities recognized both the limitations of a purely internal adjustment
and the need to strengthen the ongoing reform program. Therefore, the Government decided,
together with the other countries of the CFA franc zone, to devalue the CFA franc by 50% in foreign
currency terms, effective January 12, 1994. In addition, the authorities have set the following
objectives for 1994-96: (a) accelerate real GDP growth to more than 3.9% a year; (b) limit inflation,
as measured by GDP deflator, to approximately 3% by 1996 after a rapid increase in 1994 as a result
of the currency adjustment; ; and (c) limit the worsening of the current account deficit of the balance
of payments to 16% in 1994, and reduce it to 12% by 1996.
10.   After 50 years with a fixed exchange rate regime, external adjustment is expected to have
major short-term effects on the standard of living. Food producers have benefitted from the
devaluation as witnessed by an increased demand for rice and livestock products in neighboring
countries. However, the supply response to the shift of relative prices will take some time and the
associated benefits will be fully visible only in the medium term. Meanwhile, some of the visible
impacts will be negative, as indicated by an inflation rate of 29% (as compared to around 3% in
previous years). Food prices in urban areas have been particularly affected. For example, the price
of cereals has risen by 24%, sugar by 28%, oil by 31%, fish by 47%, salt by 52%. In addition,
transportation costs have risen by about 34% and the prices of health- and hygiene-related products
have risen by approximately 19%. These higher costs have further reduced the purchasing power of
the poor thus threatening their food security situation and malnutrition levels. In an environment of
increased poverty and unemployment caused by previous economic depression and unsuccessful
internal adjustment, it may be politically and socially difficult to sustain the implementation of the
new reform program. Unless a serious deterioration of the poverty levels is prevented, the benefits
of the initial sacrifice will be at risk.
11.   Therefore, the major challenge for IDA is to provide a quick and visible response to the
perceived negative social impacts of the reforms, without jeopardizing the longer term objectives of
effective and efficient use of scarce resources. A careful analysis of IDA's policy instruments
reveals that the proposed supplemental credit is the best tool to ensure the two objectives of rapidity
and visibility. Furthermore, making additional funds available under Project embraces two of the
"two and a half legged stool" of IDA's strategy to deal with poverty issues: the rehabilitation and
construction of urban infrastructure, using labor intensive techniques, will allow a greater population
to benefit from basic services and, simultaneously, will generate employment and revenues. Thus,
IDA is pleased with GON's willingness to use NIGETIP's services to launch a frontal attack on
poverty.
12.    The proposed supplemental credit would support GON's efforts to expand employment
opportunities and increase incomes, especially in urban areas, to provide a rapid and effective
response to the adverse ramifications of the devaluation. NIGETIP has proven over the past two
years to be an excellent tool for creating employment through the efficient and economic provision of
urban infrastructure. After only two years of implementation, all funds allocated for the civil works
component have been committed. By enabling NIGETIP to maintain a high level of activity for one
more year, the proposed supplemental credit should intensify the positive impacts of the project on



- 4 -
urban households when they are most needed.
13.    Consistency with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The current CAS statement was
reviewed by the Board on May 31, 1994.  It contains a full discussion of recent economic
developments, and IDA's assistance program. The project is fully consistent with both current and
future IDA strategies, which stress the need to focus on five key actions: (i) human resources
development; (ii) slow down population growth and the status of women; (iii) provision of adequate
infrastructure; (iv) environment, agriculture and natural resources management and (v) institutional
development and capacity building.
Description of the Proposed Supplemental Credit
14.   The proposed supplemental credit will pursue all the objectives of the initial project, by
providing US$10.0 million to extend NIGETIP's civil works activities to cover an additional
portfolio of projects in the coming year.  It will continue to finance the creation of useful
infrastructure, to increase employment opportunities, to promote the private sector and to develop
small enterprises. Moreover, in an effort to emphasize the social dimension of the additional works,
a share of the extra allocation will be specifically oriented to sanitation related projects identified by
the beneficiary populations (with the assistance of community groups or non-governmental
organizations (NGOs)). Govermment's contribution for the subprojects and activities financed by the
supplemental credit is US$1 million.
15.   The budgeted US$10 million would finance civil works for a total cost of US$9.57 million.
Sub-projects will be prepared, supervised and executed by the private sector. Maitres d'oeuvre
(consulting engineers) will be contracted to prepare final designs and bidding documents and to
supervise the execution of civil works. The cost of this preparation for accepted projects and their
supervision will be limited to 5% of the total project cost for project design and 5 % for supervision,
i.e., US$0.87 million. NIGETIP's administration fee will not exceed 5% of the program costs, i.e.,
US$0.43 million.
16.    NIGETIP's estimated output of $10.57 million for the coming year constitutes a reasonable
target given the following factors: (a) there are priority projects already identified, as the budget for
the existing Project could finance only 20% of the portfolio of eligible sub-projects submitted by the
municipalities and the central Government; (b) only 60 construction companies out of the 650 pre-
qualified have obtained contracts, so just 10% of the absorptive capacity of the sector has been
utilized until now; and (c) NIGETIP's annual output is worth US$10 million, which after the
devaluation and with an estimate 50% increase in project costs in local currency, is the equivalent of
US$7.5 million at the current exchange rate. The envisaged 16% output increase is conservative,
given the high degree of flexibility and effectiveness of this type of agency.
17.   Project Benefits. The economic benefits under the proposed supplemental credit are expected
from the wider access of the poor and the disadvantaged to urban infrastructure and investment
resources. The Project will better respond to the needs of the poor. Since the bulk of project-related
expenditures will cover local costs, the Project is likely to have a greater multiplier effect on the
local economy than other projects.  It is expected that increases in incomes will translate into
increases in spending, thus boosting the local economy and, therefore, improving the chances of



successful adjustment. At current wage rates, US$11 million expended on labor-intensive works
would generate 4,400 person-years of work.
18.   Program  Objective Categories.  The Project's continued emphasis on job creation and
increased access to services is an important component in GON's anti-poverty strategy. In addition,
the package of services offered to contractors, foremen and individual workers will further improve
the overall capacity of the construction industiy and the indivieiual skill level of the average worker,
thereby stimulating the overall labor market and improving workers' matketability.
19.   Environmental Aspects. (Original project: Category B) The cumulative impact on the
environment of works to be financed under this supplemental agreement is expected to be minor.
Moreover, most of the proposed sub-proiects should have a net positive impact on the environment.
Among the expected positive impacts are reduced water and air pollution, improved traffic
circulation, reduced flooding due to improved drainage capacity, diminished risk of contaminated
water and respiratory disease, reduction in diseases caused by stagnant water such as cholera, etc.
Nevertheless, to ensure that subprojects will not have a negative impact on the environment, the
Manual of Procedures stipulates that subprojects judged harmful to the environment will not be
eligible for execution, and the annual technical audit will also include an environmental component.
20.   Risks. The risks foreseen in the staff appraisal report -- that the volume of employment
created by the project may fall short of expectations and that NIGETIP may misuse its considerable
independence -- have not materialized. Therefore, there are no substantial risks associated with the
supplemental credit.
Implementation of the Supplemental Credit
21.   Institutional Arrangements. Arrangements for implementation of the supplemental credit are
the same as those used for the original Project. The supplemental credit will be subject to the same
monitoring and auditing reporting. Procurement and disbursement procedures would follow the
procedures of the original credit. Given the recent experience under the Project, it is expected that
the supplemental credit will be executed in about 12 months and fully disbursed in 18 months. This
will require an extension of the closing date, currently December 31, 1994, by 12 months to
December 31, 1995. It was agreed during negotiations that GON would request a one-year extension
of the closing date.
22.   Agreed Actions/Changes in the DCA. GON has requested a supplemental credit to provide
additional funds for NIGETIP. It was a condition of Board presentation that GON submit to IDA a
copy of a letter from NIGETIP to GON, acceptable to IDA, in which NIGETIP commits itself to, in
accordance with the Convention and subject to the execution of the relevant amendment to the
Development Credit Agreement dated April 5, 1991, executing additional public works with a value
equivalent to the amount of the supplemental credit and in pirsuance of a program of proposed sub-
projects to be submitted to IDA for approval not later than two months following the effectiveness
date of the aforementioned amendment.  Finally, as mentioned above, it was agreed during
negotiations that GON would request a one-year extension of the closing date.

23.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed supplemental credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Implementation Issues
1.    General Country/Political Situation: The difficult economic situation during the last few
years has been compounded by political instability. These inevitably affected the implementation of
projects in many ways: counterpart funds were not readily available; there were frequent changes in
personnel and thus a lack of continuity in project execution; deterioration in the secu:ity situation in
the north of the country which led the army, in need of equipment, to seize ten v iicles belonging to
the Small Rural Operations Project (four vehicles) and the Agricultural Services Project (six
vehicles). The Government eventually returned these vehicles to the projects, but the lack of the
vehicles over several months adversely affected the project management units' abilities to monitor
field operations. The new Government's coming to power has brought some measure of stability to
the political situation and better attention to the issues affecting project implementation. The
Government has shown more commitment to resolving implementation issues by undertaking its own
supervision reviews and analysis of the portfolio resulting in specific time-bound action plans to
which it has adhered (e.g., Small Rural Operations Project). A monthly meeting of all project
directors, chaired by the Secretary of State for Planning, is held to review and resolve problems.
The Bank's Resident Mission is always invited to participate in the meetings.
2.     Financial Management Issues: The financial constraints resulting from the crisis in public
finance and from lower levels of external assistance throughout the last three years had a major
impact on the availability of counterpart funds for some projects in the portfolio (Health, Public
Works and Employment, Primary Education, Transport Sector). Recent donor assistance (The
Netherlands, EEC) has provided some relief, but a long-term solution which includes clearer
budgetary procedures is necessary. More generally, weak financial management has also been
apparent in a variety of instances, including some mismanagement of funds. The Health Project was
the most glaring example, and it is to the Government's credit that the issue was addressed firmly
and rapidly (a new project director was named and the missing funds returned to the project).
3.    Weak Implementation Capacity: This is primarily due to weak institutional capacity and
frequent changes in project staff. The Bank is addressing these complex issues on a variety of
fronts. Most operations now include capacity building components. Time-bound action plans have
now become the norm. The Resident Mission staff is playing a very active and expanded role in
project monitoring with direct task management responsibility for a number of projects and regular
guidance to executing agencies in problem areas as well as generic issues such as accounting and
auditing.
