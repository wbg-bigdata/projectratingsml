IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF NIGER
PUBLIC WORKS AND EMPLOYMENT PROJECT
CREDIT 2209-NIR
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Public Works and
Employment Project in Niger, for which Credit 2209-NIR, in the amount of SDR 13.9 million
(US$ 20.0 million) was approved on February 19, 1991, signed on April 5, 1991, and declared
effective on December 9, 1991. A supplementary Credit, 2209-1 -NIR, in the amount of SDR 6.9
million (US$ 10 million), was approved on November 10, 1994, signed on December 23, 1994
and declared effective on September 18, 1995.
The two credits, 2209-0-NIR and 2209-1-NIR, were closed on June 30, 1997. The
original closing date was December 31, 1994. At that time, the operations financed by the initial
Credit were almost fully completed. The closing date was postponed to allow implementation of
the supplementary Credit. The last disbursement took place on September 26, 1997.
This Implementation Completion Report was prepared by Christian Diou, Senior
Municipal Engineer, AFTU2, task manager for the project, with the assistance of G6rard
Tenaille, Consultant, and was reviewed by Theodore Ahlers, Country Director for Niger and
Jerome Chevallier, Sector Manager, AFTS3. Preparation of the report started during a mission to
Niger in April 1997, of which the aide-memoire is attached. The Implementation Completion
Report is based on project files, correspondence, the Staff Appraisal Report and the Credit
Agreement. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the Implementation Completion
Report by preparing its own project implementation report in April 1997, updated in November
1997, and through its comments on the draft ICR.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
NIGER
PUBLIC WORKS AND EMPLOYMENT PROJECT
CREDIT 2209-NIR
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    This Completion Report evaluates the Public Works and Employment Project in Niger,
which was implemented by the Executing Agency NIGETIP, an institution created on the model
of the AGETIP agency in Senegal.
Project Objectives
2.    The major objectives of the project were the following: (a) create, at least temporarily,
new employment in urban areas using the private sector, and thereby stimulating small local
private contractors and consulting firms; (b) improve the individual skills of workers and the
competitiveness of the firms involved; (c) demonstrate the feasibility of labor-intensive projects
and to test procedures that will allow the public sector to commission economically and socially
useful projects; and (d) review existing public works programs and recast them with the intent of
speeding up their implementation and enhancing their overall performance.
Achievement of Objectives
3.    The project attained its objectives, as regards the creation of jobs, development of the
private sector, and physical objectives:
(a)   Job creation. The objectives were exceeded. More than 900 works contracts have been
awarded to date, for a total value of CFAF 21 billion. These contracts have led to the creation of
46,760 jobs lasting for an average of 53 days and total wage spending of CFAF 5.28 billion. The
value of wages represents 25 per cent of the overall value of the works, or 35 per cent when one
takes into account of the wages paid to the consulting firms and the personnel costs of the
Nigetip Executing Agency.
(b)   Enhancing the individual skills of workers and the competitiveness offirms. Here, the
objectives were attained. A total of 856 Niger contractors were prequalified by Nigetip (a number
that was recently reduced to 428), and 157 of these firms obtained an average of 5.7 contracts.
84 consulting firms were prequalified (this number has been reduced to 57), and 45 of them have
worked with Nigetip under a total of 442 consulting contracts and 544 works supervision
contracts. Without the Nigetip project, it is likely that a major portion of professionals would
have had to go abroad to seek employment. The activities undertaken have provided them with



. .
-11-
significant opportunities since 1995, primarily through the training and technical assistance that
has been provided to contracting finns awarded, work contracts under the project, to the
consulting firms and to the beneficiaries (in particular the municipal governments).
(c)   Demonstrating the feasibility of labor-intensive sub-projects and procedures. The results
are globally positive. Regarding the labor-intensive techniques, the field results obtained in
Niger, as in neighboring countries, were highly satisfactory. The program which was aimed at
encouraging community participation in maintaining urban infrastructure financed by the project
was partially implemented, and the target beneficiaries of the sub-projects were sensitized. The
preparatory study for setting up a mutual guarantee company was successful, and resulted in the
further development of "Taimako". On the other hand, the study on bottlenecks in public
procurement and tendering did not produce any new regulatory measures.
Economic analysis
4.    The economic analysis conducted during the project appraisal found internal rates of
return (IRR) of 26 per cent (clearing sand from roads), and 51 per cent (pavement rehabilitation).
An ex post analysis was performed in 1997, on the basis of which IRRs were calculated for
various kinds of sub-projects, revenue-generating or not: building rehabilitation (27 per cent),
road paving (21 per cent), drainage (28 per cent), construction of sports facilities (20 per cent),
bus depots (45 per cent), slaughterhouses (39 per cent), etc. These data confirm the economic
soundness of the urban works program managed by the Executing Agency.
Major factors affecting the project
5.    The only major event that affected the project was the devaluation of the CFA franc on
January 12, 1994. The Bank and the Government agreed at that time on the need to set up a
supplementary Credit of US$ 10 million in order to expand employment opportunities, and in
particular to increase the volume of works under the existing project. There were difficulties
with implementation of counterpart funds at the outset of the project.
Sustainability of the project
6.    The project is probably sustainable. This must be looked at from two angles: (a) the
capacity of Nigetip to endure after closing of the IDA credit, and to continue responding to
requests for support from the beneficiaries, local governments and government departments; and
(b) the sustainability of the sub-projects financed under the Credit.
7.    Over the medium term, the agency is probably sustainable, to judge from the capacity
it has shown to mobilize funds from sources other than IDA and the Government. Beyond that
horizon, the agency's longer-term sustainability will depend on the ability of the beneficiaries to
finance sub-projects on their own, or to find the necessary funding by themselves. Given the
current circumstances of Niger's urban sector, it might be suspected that the agency's long-term
sustainability is uncertain.



-iii-
8.    The sustainability of the works themselves is also probable over the medium term, and
uncertain in the longer term. It will depend on the ability of the beneficiaries, primarily the
municipalities, to mobilize the needed funding for maintaining the works carried out under the
project. The agency has already introduced a mechanism whereby it will turn down sub-projects
submitted by beneficiaries who fail to maintain those already implemented.
The Bank's performance
9.    The Bank's performance was satisfactory. The Bank drew upon the lessons from its
experience with the first AGETIP project in Senegal to shorten the preparation time for this
project. The Bank's project supervision was also highly satisfactory. The record of management
stability was excellent: there were only two task managers for the project over the seven year
period.
The Borrower's performance
10.   The Government's performance was satisfactory. It allowed the agency to function as
planned. It was not able, however, to meet its commitments for counterpart funding for the
project in a timely manner, and it failed to take full advantage of the study for improving public
contracting procedures. The performance of the executing agency, Nigetip, can be judged as
highly satisfactory. The Agency launched the project swiftly, and pursued its work at a steady
pace, in scrupulous observance of the procedures manual. Audit reports consistently certified the
accounts as faithfilly reflecting the project's financial situation.
Conclusion, future operations, and key lessons learned.
11.   The project may be considered as satisfactory.
12.   Nigetip has been able subsequently to undertake the Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation
Project (Cr. 2957-NIR, approved on May 29, 1997), a second KfW-financed operation, and a
CFD-financed program  for secondary towns.  Over the longer term, the process of
decentralization in Niger and an in-depth approach to the problems of its cities will demand the
adoption of a more ambitious sectoral policy to promote urban productivity.
13.   There are some important lessons to be drawn from the project, and these are generally in
line with those from other AGETIP projects: (a) an autonomous institute with its own statutes,
such as the Nigetip agency, is fully capable of carrying out public works, quicldy and effectively,
relying entirely on domestic human resources; (b) Nigetip is merely an implementation tool at
the service of the beneficiaries (municipalities and government). It cannot by itself compensate
for the lack of a sound sectoral policy; (c) quality is a very important consideration in selecting
sub-projects; and (d) grass-roots community participation must be assured if sub-projects are to
be sustainable.

A. INTRODUCTION
1.    At the time the project was prepared, the rate of growth of Niger's population (3.2 per
cent) was higher than the average for countries of the Sahel. Moreover, the urban population was
growing at 5.5 per cent a year. In 1991, the city of Niamey accounted for 45 per cent of the total
urban population, and was growing at an estimated rate of 8 per cent, or close to 30,000 people
every year. People tended to regard the problem of under-employment in urban areas as a fallout
from structural adjustment, and this perception reduced the Government's leeway in pursuing the
needed reforms.
2.    To alleviate social problems in urban centers, particularly in Niamey, the Government
hoped to supplement its adjustment efforts with labor-intensive civil works projects that would
have an immediate impact on employment. It set up a coordination group, under the authority of
the National Commission for Economic and Financial Reform, to seek ways of resolving the
growing problem of under-employment. In October 1989, this group proposed a Program to
Alleviate the Social Costs of Adjustment (PACSA), which called for a variety of measures in the
areas of health, population, education, water supply, rural development, environental protection
and public works among others. It was decided at that time to take an approach to
implementation of such works in the urban sector based on the AGETIP (Public Works and
Employment Agency) model, following the successful experience that was then underway in
Senegal, and another that was in preparation for Burkina Faso. IDA was thus able to help the



-2-
Government draw up a similar project for Niger, in a way that combined the goal of
rehabilitating urban infrastructure with that ofjob creation.
B.   PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Description of Objectives
3.    The main objectives of the project, as described in the Staff Appraisal report 9032-NIR,
of January 11, 1991, were:
(a)   to create, at least temporarily, substantial new employment in urban areas as
rapidly as possible, using the private sector, thereby stimulating small local private contractors
and consulting firms;
(b)   to improve, through execution of the works financed by the project, the individual
skills of the workers who would be employed and the corporate competitiveness of the firms that
would carry out the works, so as to develop their capacity to respond to increased opportunities
for sustained employment after completion of the project;
(c)   to demonstrate the feasibility of labor-intensive projects and to test procedures
that would enable the public sector to commission projects that were economically and socially
useful; and
(d)   to review existing public works programs and recast them with the intent of
speeding up their implementation and enhancing their overall performance.
4.    In pursuing these objectives, the following conditions were to be fulfilled: (a) avoiding
any increase in civil service employment; (b) combining low cost and high visibility; (c)
supporting but not replacing other development programs, and (d) using transparent but
expeditious and flexible procedures for subproject bidding, appraisal, contracting and
disbursements.
5.    To achieve these objectives, the project contained the following components: (a) a
program of public facility and infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance in urban areas to be
carried out under labor-intensive schemes by local contractors; (b) a package of services related
to work organization, management and labor force training to be offered on a voluntary basis to
the local contractors that were awarded works contracts; (c) a supervision and monitoring
component to allow progress under the project to be monitored closely, and to prepare the
transition toward locally generated employment; (d) a selective audit of public works programs
to identify bottlenecks and design system improvements; and (e) a package of consultant services
related to (i) a training program for the beneficiaries and consulting firms on the preparation of
feasibility studies and technical project appraisals; (ii) a program aimed at increasing grassroots
participation in urban infrastructure maintenance; and (iii) the preparatory work for the
establishment of a mutual guarantee company.



-3-
Assessment of objectives and risks
6.    The project's objectives were clear and realistic, and were based on experience with a
similar project in Senegal. The goal of implementing the project in three years was an ambitious
one, but in fact nearly 95 per cent of the initial Credit was disbursed within that limit, although
an increase in the initial Credit was decided during Negotiations. The objectives remained valid
for the duration of the project, despite a difficult institutional environment. They were confirmed
in 1994, during preparation of the supplementary Credit, and are still valid today.
7.    The major risk identified during the assessment was the possibility that the country's
economy might not be able to generate stable job opportunities at the rate foreseen for the
program. In that case, it would be necessary to extend the implementation period, which could
have resulted in management cost overruns. Another risk was that the jobs created would tend to
remain concentrated in local government, rather than in the private sector. Neither of these risks
materialized. On the contrary, the construction industry was able to adapt and grow by taking
advantage of the contract tendering process. Such opportunities were multiplied, moreover,
through financing provided by other donors to Nigetip. Finally, a further risk identified, was that
it might be more difficult to supervise and monitor the use of project funds than would be the
case with a conventional investment project, because of the Agency's high degree of autonomy.
Not only did this risk not materialize, but the broad experience that has now been built up in
projects of this kind shows that the procedures in place, when respected, are sufficient to avoid
these risks.
8.    An important risk that was not identified during the project appraisal was that the Agency
may become so effective that it might be used for tasks it was never designed for -- either to take
on contracts that were too large, and hence beyond the scope of its procedures manual, or that
were located outside urban areas, at the request of project managers or donors looking for a
competent executing agency. This risk however did not materialize during the project, because
the Agency was able to concentrate on its area of primary competence: small, labor-intensive
projects in urban areas. There were a few cases where the Agency may have been led to take on
commitments for which it could not properly guarantee completion. This risk, however, does not
relate to the concept of delegated project management itself, which seems to be adaptable to rural
settings, provided a suitably competent structure is set up.
C.   ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
9.    The objectives of the project were attained, in terms of job creation, private sector
development and physical objectives.
Degree of attainment of objectives
10. Job creation. The objectives were exceeded. Table 5 in Part II shows that more than
900 works contracts have been awarded, for a total value of CFAF 21 billion. These contracts



-4-
have led to the creation of 46,760 jobs, for an average duration of 53 days, and the disbursement
of CFAF 5.28 billion in wages. The value of wages represents 25 per cent of the overall cost of
the works, compared with estimates in the appraisal report, which called for a floor of 20 per
cent. The economic analysis conducted during the appraisal forecast a labor component as high
as 33 per cent, taking into account the wages and salaries paid to consulting firms (studies and
supervision) and the personnel costs of Nigetip. Using such a basis for calculation, the value of
wages rises to 35 per cent, broken down as follows: (a) private company manpower: 25.2 per
cent; (b) consultants/salaries: 6.6 per cent, and (c) Nigetip staff remuneration: 3 per cent.
11.   Enhancing individual worker's skills and company competitiveness. The objectives
were attained. 856 local contractors were prequalified (this number was recently reduced to
428), and 157 of these firms obtained a total of 901 contracts. 84 consulting firms were
prequalified (this number has been reduced to 57), and 45 of them have worked with Nigetip
under a total of 442 consulting contracts and 544 works supervision contracts. These are very
significant results, for since 1989 the job situation for engineers and architects already on the
market or returning from abroad after graduation has been very tight. A great many construction
businesses, and a number of consulting firms (about 40 of the 45 that won contrcts from
Nigetip) were created with these specific opportunities in view, with support from an informal
-taining program that involved apprenticeship assignments with Nigetip. Without the Nigetip
project, it is likely that a major portion of professionals would have had to go abroad to seek
employment. The activities undertaken have represented a significant opportunity for them since
1995, at a time when construction and public works activities in Niger were for the most part
effectively shut down. The project has allowed these contractors and consulting firms to prosper
and grow. The training and technical assistance provided to firms awarded work contracts under
the project, to the consulting firms and to the beneficiaries (in particular the municipal
governments) has had a major impact on the sector. In total, over a period of three years, 793
business managers and technicians have benefited from technical training modules, and 250 from
management modules. A training session for consulting firms was also organized with German
cooperation. Twenty-four consulting firms received training over a two-week period on topics
related to planning, preparing bid proposals, and construction techniques using local materials.
12.   Demonstration of the feasibility of labor-intensive subprojects and procedures
testing. The results are globally positive. With respect to the use of labor-intensive techniques,
the field results obtained in Niger, as in neighboring countries, were highly satisfactory, and
showed the broad feasibility of executing subprojects in this manner. These encouraging results
should be viewed against a context where the Agency has to sub-contract studies, works and
supervisory activities to local firms. This approach poses no particular problems for straight-
forward works of the kind regularly undertaken by competent local companies, as was the case
under this project. In future projects, however, it will be important to ensure that the local
resources required for the investments are actually available, or that, if necessary, the works
program can be supplemented by a training and support program for local contractors and
consulting firms.
13.   With respect to the studies and their impact, the results were mixed. The study on
bottlenecks in procurement, contracting, supervision, payments and audits that impede project



-5-
implementation was carried out. The consultants submitted a draft Plan of Action to the
Government in September, 1992, that included a draft decree amending and supplementing
decree No. 89/117/PCMS/PM of April 27, 1989 on the regulation of public procurement. During
the course of 1996, the National Commission on Public Procurement (CNMP) began a gradual
implementation of these recommendations, and succeeded in reducing the number of
procurement steps from 33 to 13. Unfortunately, contrary to earlier expectations, the new
regulations have not been introduced. The program aimed at encouraging community
participation in maintaining urban infrastructure financed by the project has been partially
implemented. The target beneficiaries of the subprojects have been sensitized. The quality of
projects submitted to Nigetip has improved, but there has been little benefit in terms of
community maintenance of infrastructure. Finally, the preparatory study for setting up a mutual
guarantee company was successful. It was presented in 1995, and has helped to strengthen the
Taimako ("Entraide" or mutual aid), a cooperative institution created in 1993 with a statute
allowing it to provide financial guarantees. Taimako now has 1,900 members, including 140
contractors and consulting finns, and it has provided about 50 guarantees for start-up loans and
contract holdbacks under the project. To date, only one guarantee, in the amount of CFAF
600,000, has failed to be recovered.
Economic Analysis
14.   An economic analysis was conducted during the project appraisal stage, on the basis of a
sample of subprojects eligible for financing under the Credit: removal of sand from roadways,
road surface rehabilitation, cleaning out drainage ditches, garbage collection, building repairs and
the treatment of koris (seasonal watercourses). In those cases where internal rates of return could
be determined, they were estimated at 26 per cent (for clearing sand from roads) and 51 per cent
(for pavement rehabilitation). An ex post analysis was conducted in 1997 to validate these data
and to test a suitable method for the economic and financial analysis of projects that Nigetip
could use in the future. Applied to the first set of subprojects proposed under the Urban
Infiastructure Rehabilitation project then in preparation, this method allowed IRRs to be
calculated for various types of subprojects, income-generating or not: building rehabilitation (27
per cent), street paving (21 per cent), drainage (28 per cent), construction of sports facilities (20
per cent), bus depots (45 per cent), slaughterhouses (39 per cent), etc. These data confirm the
economic soundness of the urban works program managed by the Agency, and they have now
been integrated into the method of selecting subprojects for which Nigetip will be responsible
under the new funding agreements with various donors.
D.   FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Factors not attributable to the Government
15.   The only important event affecting the project was the devaluation of the CFA franc on
January 12, 1994. In the wake of this move, a Bank mission visited Niger to discuss with the
Government the possibility of a supplementary Credit that would help to overcome the negative
effects of the devaluation on low-income groups. The Bank and the Government agreed at that



-6-
time on the need to set up a supplementary Credit of US$ 10 million in order to expand
employment opportunities, in particular by increasing the volume of works related to the projects
then underway. Negotiations were concluded in Niamey in August 1994, and the Credit was
approved on November 10, 1994. Effectiveness was postponed three times because, as with the
original Credit, the legal opinion was late in arriving at the Bank. The supplementary Credit was
finally declared effective on September 18, 1995. This led to the extension of the closing date of
the initial Credit, from December 31, 1994 to June 30, 1996. In light of the delay in declaring
the supplementary Credit effective, the 1995 work program of Nigetip was slowed down
significantly, for reasons that had nothing to do with the Agency's own capabilities. In order to
make full use of this supplementary Credit, the closing date of the Credit had to be postponed yet
again to June 30, 1997.
Factors attributable to the Government
16.   The Government was supposed to provide counterpart funding for 10 per cent of project
costs, or the equivalent of US$ 3.3 million. The counterpart contribution for 1992 was paid only
in part (CFAF 150 million of a total of CFAF 412.5 million due), because of the country's
institutional and financial difficulties. To force the project back on track, IDA threatened
suspension of disbursements. The Government then turned to the European Community, and
subsequently to the Dutch Government, and between them, the needed counterpart funds were
finally provided through budgetary support (CFAF 500 million and CFAF 359 million,
respectively). In addition, according to the appraisal report, cofinancing of US$ 10 million was
expected from other donors, in particular the KfW and OPEC. A KfW grant of DM 13 million
was negotiated in 1992, and has been fully implemented. OPEC approved a credit of US$ 4
million on September 11, 1991 (554-P). Unfortunately, OPEC suspended aid to Niger in 1995,
for default on payments. This suspension meant that Nigetip was late in making nearly CFAF
500 million in payments to the contractors, who were consequently obliged to stop work.
17.  Nigetip, the agency created under the project, was in fact responsible only for execution
of the works and services component. The other project components were supposed to be carried
out by the Coordination Unit for the Program to Alleviate the Social Costs of Adjustment
(PACSA), within the Planning Ministry, which moreover had overall responsibility for the
project. So it was Government's responsibility to implement the new procurement guidelines.
Unfortunately, this procedure did not come to fruition, and despite some improvements, the
average lapse of time between the issuing of a call for bids and the signing of a contract has
remained very long.
18.   At the conclusion of the project, the Government asked Nigetip to suspend
implementation of the final portfolio of works that was about to be launched, and to replace the
planned social facilities with customs stations. While this decision may have appeared justified
from the Government's viewpoint (because it would help to increase state revenues), it was a
blow to the beneficiaries, and has led to a certain amount of foot-dragging and resentment on the
part of the local authorities. Furthermore, it definitely was not sustaining the project's rationale.
In order to diminish the impact on the people concerned, the Government has undertaken to
devote future funds to the construction of social infrastructure.



-7-
Factors dependent on the project unit
19.   Nigetip has been able to execute the subprojects and to disburse the credits under highly
satisfactory conditions, despite the difficult institutional environment. This success is due in
large part to the Agency's autonomy, which the Government has wisely preserved, and to its
strict adherence to carefully prepared procedures.
E.    SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROJECT
20.   The project can be said to be probably sustainable. This probability must be looked at
from two angles: (i) the capacity of Nigetip to endure after closing of the IDA Credit, and to
continue responding to requests for support from the beneficiaries, local governments and
government departments; and (ii) the sustainability of the sub-projects financed under the Credit.
Sustainability of Nigetip
21.   Over the medium term, the agency is probably sustainable, to judge from the capacity
it has shown to mobilize funds from sources other than IDA and the Government. Despite the
unfavorable institutional environment, Nigetip has in fact been able to offer itself as the
executing agency for other projects, financed by IDA and other sources to a total of nearly CFAF
36 billion. At the same time, Nigetip has been retained as the executing agency for the new
Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation project. This will represent three to four years of continued,
steady activity for the Agency. Beyond that horizon, the agency's sustainability will depend on
the ability of the beneficiaries to finance sub-projects on their own, or to find the necessary
funding by themselves. Given the current circumstances of Niger's urban sector, it might be
suspected that the agency's long-term sustainability is uncertain.
Sustainability of the subprojects
22.   The sustainability of the works themselves is also probable over the medium term, and
uncertain over the long term. It will depend on the ability of the beneficiaries, primarily the
municipalities, to mobilize the needed fimding for maintaining the works carried out under the
project. The agency has already introduced a mechanism whereby it will turn down subprojects
submitted by beneficiaries who fail to maintain works already in place. Initially, beneficiaries
are likely to set up the necessary maintenance mechanisms so that they can remain eligible for
the funding still available. Over the longer run, however, their capacity to finance this
maintenance will depend on the institutional reforms now under study within the broader context
of decentralization in Niger. It is only through the preparation and introduction of reforms of this
kind that sufficient resources for infrastructure maintenance, at the central and local levels, can
be mobilized.

F.   THE BANK'S PERFORMANCE
23.   The Bank's performance has been satisfactory. The Bank was able to draw upon the
lessons from its experience with the first AGETIP project in Senegal to shorten the preparation
time for this project. A project identification mission was conducted in February 1990. No
further preparatory mission was necessary, and the project appraisal mission followed. During
negotiations, the Bank accepted the Niger delegation's request to raise the proposed amount of
the Credit from US$ 15 million to US$ 20 million. The Bank's project supervision was also
highly satisfactory. The appraisal report called for three supervision missions per year between
1991 and 1993, but this turned out to be unnecessary. In fact, there were two supervision
missions each year, from 1992 to 1995, one in 1996 and a final one in 1997, reflecting the fact
that the closing date of the project had been extended to accommodate the supplementary Credit
agreed in 1994. This pattern of supervision was fully adequate, thanks to the excellent
performance of Nigetip. The record of management stability was excellent: there were only two
project task managers over the seven year period.
G. THE BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
24.   The Government's performance was satisfactory. It allowed the executing agency to
function as planned. Nevertheless, the initial Credit signed on April 5, 1991, was only declared
effective on December 1991, after two postponements, and the supplementary Credit only came
into effect nine months after signature: delays in both cases were caused by the Govermnent's
failure to provide the required legal opinion on time. Moreover, the Government was not able to
meet its commitments for counterpart funding for the project in a timely manner, and the
resulting shortfall had to be made up by appeals to the European Community and the Dutch
Government. Finally, the study for improving public procurement contracting procedures was
carried out in a satisfactory manner, but the Government has not taken it fully to heart, and has
yet to issue the necessary decrees.
25.   As stipulated in the Credit Agreement, the project accounts were audited twice a year by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA. Audit reports were submitted to IDA on a regular basis,
although with some delay, and they consistently certified that the accounts faithfully reflected the
project's financial situation. Moreover, while these were not required under the Credit
Agreement, a technical audit and an analysis of the Agency's operations were conducted in 1995
and 1996, on the basis of which certain improvements in the Agency's procedures were
suggested.
Performance of Nigetip
26.   The performance of the executing agency, Nigetip, can be judged as highly satisfactory.
The Agency was organized as a private body, with its own Board of Directors, chaired by the
General Manager and composed of six members: the Business and Industry Employers'
Association of Niger (SPEIN), the National Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
of Niger (SYNAPEMEN), the National Union of Cooperatives (UNC), the Confederation of



-9-
Labor Unions of Niger (USTN), the Association of Cities and Communes of Niger (AVCN), and
the Women's Association of Niger (AFN). The Agency launched the project swiftly, and
pursued its work at a steady pace, in scrupulous observance of the procedures manual. There
were no problems with procurement or contracting: local contractors and consultants benefited
greatly from the project and from the procedures in place, in particular Nigetip's practice of
making prompt payments. In 1993, the average turnaround time for invoices was 3 days,
compared with the 10 days called for in the procedures manual.
27.   The total financing obtained by NIGETIP from its inception amounts to nearly CFAF 36
billion, or three times the amount provided by IDA. It was only because it could offer assurances
that the investments would be conducted in a fully transparent manner, according to clearly
stated procedures, that Nigetip was able to attract such significant resources.

H.   ASSESSMENT OF PROJECT OUTCOME
28.   The project may be considered as satisfactory. It attained and in fact exceeded its
objectives in terms of job creation, which was its primary raison d'etre, and physical objectives
as well. It had a considerable impact on local contractors, and in particular on the engineering
firms, since Nigetip has consistently been the only agency providing steady work for these
entities.
I.    FUTURE OPERATIONS
29.   The Nigetip experience, and similar experiences elsewhere in sub-Saharah Africa
(Senegal, Burkina Faso, Mali, Togo, Madagascar, Gambia, Benin, Mauritania), have
demonstrated that the objectives of reducing poverty and improving management are in fact
attainable goals when pursued by agencies of this type. Already, a new project has been
prepared and readied for implementation, as called for in the country assistance document (CAS,
May 1994): the Urban Infastructure Rehabilitation project (Cr. 2857-NIR), approved by the
EBoard on May 29, 1997, will provide further impetus to the anti-poverty campaign by prolonging
urban job creation activities. It is expected to become effective shortly. Moreover, in addition to
the first grant provided by the German KfW, a second grant of DM 15 million is likely to
become effective in the near future, now that the previous suspension of disbursements has been
lifted. Finally, the CFD is now activating an operation for secondary towns, in the amount of
CFAF two billion. These are all quick-disbursing projects, aimed at promoting short-term
solutions to the country's current difficulties, and all have a strong social component. Over the
longer term, a sound sectoral policy to promote urban productivity will be required if the
country's decentralization (now in the planning stages) is to proceed, and if the persistent
problems of its cities are to be addressed in depth (improvement of municipal management,
capacity building, resource mobilization, etc.).
J.    KEY LESSONS LEARNED
30.   This project was the first of its kind in Niger. As deemed appropriate at the time of
preparation, the objectives identified were simple and limited in scope. This choice was a good
one and proved to be very appropriate given the current situation of the country. There are some
important lessons to be drawn from the project, and these are in line with those from previous
y Agetip projectsrThe project has demonstrated that:
(a) An autonomous agency with its own statutes, such as the Nigetip agency, is fully
capable of carrying out public works, quickly and effectively, by relying entirely on domestic
human resources. All that is required is to set out clearly and in advance the procedures that are
to be followed, to select the persons needed to apply them, and to make use of them within an
appropriate managerial framework.



-1 1-
(b) Nigetip is merely an implementation tool at the service of the beneficiaries
(municipalities, government), who must retain full responsibility for investment identification,
planning, programming and maintenance. As a tool, the Agency cannot by itself compensate for
the lack of a sound policy for the sector in question (urban development, health, education, etc.).
The links between Nigetip and the sectoral programs or projects should serve to strengthen
project management, especially at the municipal level, and these links need to be clearly thought
out before the agreement delegating that management is drawn up.
(c) Quality is an important consideration in selecting sub-projects. The current ad hoc
approach to operations should be replaced by a single, coherent investment program, extending
over several years as necessary. Despite their highly positive impact, some subprojects have
been accorded insufficient priority by the municipalities. Municipalities would benefit greatly
from a planning framework that would guide the selection of local investments.
(d) Grass-roots community participation must be assured if sub-projects are to be
sustainable, and if there is to be a proper match between the problem and the nature of the
response to it, in particular with respect to the cost of the investment and its maintenance.
Despite the great efforts made under this project, much remains to be done to resolve this aspect.
31.   These lessons learned, as well as the Operations Evaluation Department's audit of Agetip
projects in Africa have been taken into consideration during the preparation of the Urban
infrastructure Rehabilitation Project. The first steps toward improvement are reflected in the
Staff Appraisal Report of this new project (report n°16460-NIR, dated May 6, 1997):
(a) The manual of procedures is updated on the basis of technical and management audits.
The transition period between the two projects was used to adjust the human resources of the
Agency to the work program;
(b) The strengthening of the identification, planmng, programming and maintenance
capacities of municipalities is part of the new project's activities, through inter alia the
establishment of simplified urban development tools, the definition of new methodologies for
urban management and resource mobilization, and provision of basic cartography. This
approach will also be utilized to enhance the coherence of the portfolio of sub-projects submitted
and their quality; and
(c) The new project includes an Information, Education and Communication component
aimed at developing beneficiaries' involvement in subproject identification, preparation and
operation.

NIGER
PROJET DE TRAVAUX D'INTERET PUBLIC POUR L'EMPLOI (TIPE)
Mission d'Achevement
de l'Association Internationale de D6veloppement (IDA)
Christian Diou - AFTU2
(du 13 au 20 avril 1997)
AIDE-MEMOIRE
1.    La mission IDA effectu6e par Christian Diou (AFTU2) et Gerard Tenaille (Consultant)
du 13 au 20 avril 1997 etait la derniere mission de supervision du projet. Elle avait pour
objectifs principaux: (i) de lancer un processus d'evaluation aussi complet que possible des
performances du projet, de son impact et des difficultes rencontrees dans sa mise en oeuvre, tant
par l'emprunteur que par la Banque; et (ii) de revoir, avec le bureau du projet, les dernieres
operations en cours ou a lancer avant la cloture. Elle a beneficie du soutien de Sophie Revillion
(Specialiste Audit et Comptabilite a la Mission Residente de Ouagadougou).
2.    La mission remercie l'ensemble des personnalites rencontrees (liste en Annexe 1) pour
leur accueil et leur disponibilite et tout particulierement Monsieur Roger Nignon, Directeur
G6ndral de l'Agence Nigetip, ainsi que toute son equipe.
3.    La mission a pu disposer du rapport d'achevement prepare par le Gouvernement. Ce
rapport figure en Annexe 2 au present Aide-Memoire. I1 sera actualise par l'Agence aprbs la
cloture du Credit. Des visites de sous-projets mis en oeuvre par Nigetip sur financement du
Credit n.2209-NIR ou sur financement d'autres bailleurs ou d'autres projets IDA ont pu etre
effectuees a Niamey et, a l'occasion d'un deplacement A l'interieur du pays, a Agadez, Tahoua,
Bouza, Madaoua, Dogueraoua, Birni N'Konni, Dogondoutchi, Dosso et Birin N'Gaoure. La
mission s'est 6galement efforcee, A l'occasion de ces deplacements, de rencontrer les autorites
locales, les entreprises et les consultants ayant travaille avec Nigetip.
4.    Le Credit initial, approuve en fevrier 1991, a e mis en vigueur le 9 decembre 1991. -I
6tait presque entifrement decaisse au d6but de l'annee 1994. Le Gouvemement du Niger et
l'IDA ont alors mis en place un financement complementaire de 10 millions de dollars pour
attenuer les impacts negatifs de la devaluation. Ce Credit supplementaire est entre en vigueur en
septembre 1995 et etait affecte a un programme complementaire de travaux, aux etudes
techniques et a la supervision de ces travaux, ainsi qu'au financement des couts d'operation de
l'Agence. Pour permettre sa mise en oeuvre, la date de cloture du projet a e prorogee au 30
juin 1996 puis au 30 juin 1997.

5.    La mission a pu constater que les resultats du projet Travaux d'lnteret Public pour
l'Ermploi (TIPE) semblaient a ce jour tres satisfaisants. En particulier, les previsions de creation
d'emplois et le nombre de realisations physiques etaient tres au-dela des previsions de
l'evaluation. L'Agence a su rester performante depuis sa creation malgre un environnement
institutionnel et economique difficile, ce qui semble prouver la validite du concept. Aucun fait
majeur n'a reellement affecte le fonctionnement de l'Agence qui a ainsi beneficie en 1994 d'un
Cr6dit supplementaire de 10 millions de US$ pour attenuer les impacts n6gatifs de la devaluation
du franc CFA, alors que le Credit initial etait quasiment entifrement decaisse. Les bonnes
periformances de l'Agence lui ont 6galement permis de mobiliser d'autres financements qui
devraient lui permettre d'assurer son fonctionnement a moyen terme, sous reserve d'une mise en
vigueur effective des Credits correspondants. Les modifications du Manuel de Procedures, afin
d'eviter les imperfections constatees lors de la mise en oeuvre des projets, sont actuellement
mises en oeuvre dans le cadre de la pr6paration d'un second projet TIPE (Projet de R6habilitation
des Infrastructures Urbaines, en instance de negociation).
6.    On peut cependant constater un glissement des depenses de gestion de l'Agence qui
exc6dent parfois l'objectif informel de 5% (aucune limite superieure n'est mentionnee dans
l'Accord de Credit, mais ce ratio est celui utilise par Nigetip pour les nouvelles conventions avec
les bailleurs). Par ailleurs, le Gouvemement a souhaite, lors du dernier trimestre de l'ann6e
1996, modifier entierement le portefeuille de sous-projets financ6s par le Credit en cours de mise
en oeuvre. Des travaux non encore engages ont donc ete suspendus et remplaces par des
constructions destinees A abriter des bureaux des services des finances generateurs de revenus
pour l'Etat. Ce changement de programme de construction a provoque un retard de mise en
oeuvre et explique que les travaux soient en cours actuellement. Cependant, l'Agence a confirme
A la mission que les delais d'execution et la date de cl6ture seraient respect6s.
7.    Les observations de la mission, exposees dans le present Aide-Memoire et ses annexes,
devront etre confirmees apres son retour au siege. La mission a 6galement pr6pare un premier
projet de rapport d'achevement qu'elle a laisse A l'Agence afin que celle-ci lui fasse connaitre ses
observations.
Validite des hypotheses initiales
8.    Les objectifs principaux retenus par le Gouvemement du Niger et la Banque pendant la
phase preparatoire du projet etaient les suivants:
(a) creer un nombre substantiel d'emplois dans le secteur priv6 dans les zones urbaines;
(b) ameliorer les competences individuelles des travailleurs qui seront employes ainsi que la
comp6titivite des entreprises;
(c) d6montrer la faisabilite de projets a haute intensit6 de main d'oeuvre et mettre  r essai les
proc&dures qui permettront au secu public de faire executer ces projets -conomiquement
ou socialementjustifies; et
Projet de Travaux d'Int6rdt Public pour l'Emploi - Mission d'Ach6vement- Avril 1997  Page 2



(d) examiner les programmes de travaux publics existants et les remanier de facon a en
accelerer l'ex6cution et en ameliorer la performance en gen&al.
9.    Le programme d'actions qui en decoulait reposait essentiellement sur le financement de
travaux publics et de services dans les zones urbaines du Niger, a mettre en oeuvre par l'Agence
Nigetip, complete par diverses actions dont la mise en oeuvre dependait de l'Unit6 de
Coordination du Programme d'Att6nuation des Coats Sociaux de I'Ajustement (PACSA), sous
tutelle du Ministere du Plan: formation & l'attention des beneficiaires, des entreprises et des
consultants; etude des goulots d'etranglement des procedures de passation de marches; etude
d'un fonds de garantie mutuelle; developpement de la participation communautaire; programme
de suivi-6valuation des activites du projet. D'une maniere generale, la periode de mise en oeuvre
du projet n'a pas connu de remise en cause fondamentale des hypotheses initiales.
Activit6s de l'Agence Nigetip
10.   En six ann6es d'activite, l'Agence a engage pres de 25 milliards de FCFA de projets, dont
21 milliards de FCFA de travaux correspondant i 901 contrats de travaux, auxquels il faut
ajouter 442 march6s d'6tudes et 544 marches de contr6le pour 1'ensemble des conventions de
financement sign6es avec differents projets IDA (y compris le projet TIPE) ou d'autres bailleurs
de fonds. 60% concement la rehabilitation ou la construction de batiments simples et 30% le
drainage de points bas. Le reste conceme des interventions sur diverses infrastructures urbaines,
le debroussaillage, la restauration de sols, etc. L'Agence a ainsi gener6 une masse salariale de
5,3 milliards de FCFA, soit un ratio de main d'oeuvre de 25,2% pour les projets ternines et
r6ceptionn6s, la dur6e moyenne des emplois sur 1'ensemble de la periode s'etablissant a 53 jours.
11.   Le ratio de gestion pour la totalite des op6rations s'dtablit a 7,2% pour 1996, contre 10%
pour l'annee precedente, mais seulement 2,8% pour 1994. Le ratio provisoire pour le debut de
l'annee 1997 s'etablirait A environ 9%. L'Agence prevoit d'atteindre 6.5% sur l'ensemble des
operations au 30 juin 1997, soit au-dela du niveau de 5% souhaite. I1 convient de remarquer
cependant que:
(a) l'Agence a ete amenee a accepter de mettre en oeuvre des sous-projets dans des zones
eparses, tres eloignees et difficiles d'acces. Ces operations ont entrainm une augmentation
des frais de l'Agence;
(b) pour des raisons extemes A l'Agence, des decaissements sur certaines conventions
avec des bailleurs de fonds ont ete suspendues (OPEP), tandis que d'autres ne sont pas
encore actives (KfW, CFD). Cette baisse de l'activite entraine mecaniquement, A charges
de personnel egales, une hausse relative des frais de gestion.
12.   En ce qui conceme le calcul du ratio des frais de fonctionnement, il convient de noter que
lors d'une rencontre des directeurs administratifs et financiers et des conseillers juridiques des
Agences de projets TIPE dans le cadre de l'Association Africatip (septembre 1995) il a ete retenu
Projet de Travaux d'Intfr6t Public pour l'Emploi - Mission d'Achevement- Avril 1997  Page 3



d'effectuer le calcul sur la base de la totalite des activites, et non seulement des travaux ou
services. Cette interpretation permet de comparer les cof1ts de fonctionnement des Agences TIPE
entre elles et devrait pour cela &re maintenue (A moins d'une d6cision de changement de cette
convention par le reseau Africatip). II convient egalement de noter que les premieres
conventions de financement ne prevoyaient pas le financement de frais de gestion. Ceux-ci ont
donc et pris en charge par le Credit n.2209-NIR, ce qui explique les forts taux constates dans le
Cr6dit. Les conventions signees depuis 1996 prevoient desormais cette remuneration.
13.  la mission recommande de plus, pour faciliter le controle des cofits sans porter prejudice A
la qualite des prestations, d'etudier la possibilit6 de se faire remunerer, au delA des 5% prevus
desormais dans les conventions de financement, toute action qui ne releverait pas strictement de
sa fonction de maltre d'ouvrage delegue ou tout depassement justifi6 par des interventions plus
coiteuses. Afin de mettre en oeuvre cette disposition, l'Agence devra se doter, comme pr6vu
actuellement, d'une comptabilit6 analytique et proposer un calcul du ratio de ses frais de
fornctionnement approuve par les bailleurs. Enfin, la mission recommande egalement que
l'Agence prenne en compte sa charge de travail effective (et non plus planifiee) dans la
determination de ses besoins en personnel. Les capacites d'independance de l'Agence sont
fortement conditionnres par l'analyse et la maitrise de ses couts de fonctionnement intemes
rapproches de son niveau d'activite. Cette disposition est d'autant plus imperative que I'Agence
ne pourra, a partir du 1 er juillet prochain, imputer ses frais de fonctionnement que sur les
conventions alors en vigueur.
14.   Au cours de l'annee 1996, 222 marches de travaux ont e  attribues pour l'ensemble des
bailleurs, pour une valeur de 5,1 milliards de FCFA. Le montant moyen du marche est ainsi
passe de 15 millions de FCFA en 1995 A 23 millions de FCFA en 1996. Le nombre d'entreprises
adjudicataires a W de 123 en 1996, soit un ratio de 1,8 marche par entreprise.
15.   Deux nouvelles conventions sont en instance de demarrage: KfW H (5 milliards de
FCFA) et CFDNiIIes secondaires (2 milliards de FCFA). Les etudes sont en cours sur la
convention KfW II et devraient d6marrer en juin prochain pour la convention CFD. Le montant
total des engagements pour l'ensemble des bailleurs se monte desormais a pres de 26 milliards de
FC]FA, pour 35 milliards de FCFA de conventions signees. La difference est attribuable
essentiellement aux conventions KfW II et CFD (pour 7 milliards de FCFA) et a diverses
operations en cours de programmation (don hollande, CFD/Petits marches, etc.). Le tableau
detaille se trouve en Annexe 3.
16.   Parmi ces conventions, il convient de mentionner le cas particulier de l'Accord OPEP
n.55'4P. Les operations financees par ce Credit ont du etre interrompues par l'Agence au debut
de l'annee 1996 a la suite de la suspension par 1'OPEP des decaissements sur le Niger. Cette
mesure a eu comme consequence l'arret d'un certain nombre de chantiers en cours et des retards
de paiements a certaines entreprises concemant les derniers decomptes des travaux en cours au
moment de l'arret des decaissements par l'OPEP. Les dernieres tentatives en vue de la reprise
des decaissements par l'OPEP esperee par I'Agence n'ont pas ete couronnees de succes. Afin
d' eviter un impact negatif majeur sur les entreprises et l'image de l'Agence, la mission
recommande que des dispositions soient prises dans les meilleurs delais pour mettre en place un
Projet de Travaux d'Interet Public pour 1'Emnploi - Mission d'Achevement- Avril 1997    Page 4



financement de substitution. Ce financement serait utilise pour permettre le paiement des somme
dues aux entreprises et l'achevement des travaux engages. II pourrait par exemple ere envisage
dans le cadre du futur credit IDA a mettre en place et confirme lors des prochaines n6gociations
du projet TIPE2. Il a ete convenu que l'Agence preparerait un expose des motifs accompagne
d'un inventaire detaille des contrats concemrs et le ferait parvenir a la Banque dans des delais
compatibles avec le calendrier envisage pour les negociations du projet TIPE2.
Execution du Projet TIPE (Cr. 2209-NIR)
17.   Les projets des portefeuilles 1991-1995 sont entierement termines. Certains projets
finances par le Credit, initialement identifies au titre du portefeuille 1996 ont ete suspendus
depuis fin 1996 a la demande du Gouvemement pour permettre le fmancement d'un programme
d'urgence destin6 a soutenir les efforts du pays en matiere de mobilisation des ressources. Les
operations dont l'execution a ete suspendue concemaient pour beaucoup d'entre elles des
operations identifiees avec une forte participation communautaire dans les departements les plus
pauvres du Niger. La mission a rappele l'importance de ces sous-projets pour les populations.
Comme convenu lors de la suspension de ces operations, la mission recommande que toutes les
dispositions soient effectivement prises pour que ces operations suspendues soient financees dans
un autre cadre. La liste d6taillde de ces nouvelles operations et des operations suspendues figure
en Annexe 4.
18.   L'Agence a confirme que les demiers travaux seraient entibrement termines au 30 juin
1997. Il a ete convenu que l'Agence ferait parvenir A la Banque la liste complbte des operations
funancees par le Credit, par beneficiaire, dbs la date de cl6ture. La mission a souligne qu'il
convenait que l'Agence suive ces derniers engagements avec attention afin de s'assurer que la
totalit6 des engagements n'excederait en aucun cas le montant mis A disposition dans le cadre du
Crddit. Afin de faciliter les operations de cl6ture du Credit, la mission recommande egalement
qu'un delai de quatre mois maximum soit accorde aprbs le 30 juin 1997 pour permettre le
decaissement des sommes correspondant a des depenses eligibles effectuees confonnrment a
l'Accord de Credit avant la date de cloture.
19.   La mise en place d'un systbme de caution mutuelle des entreprises est desormais effective
A la Caisse Populaire d'Epargne et de Credit Taimako (entr'aide, en haoussa). Cette caissse a
commence a fonctionner en 1993 et la premibre caution a ete accordee en 1994. A ce jour, une
cinquantaine de cautions ont ete delivrees dont une quinzaine encore en vigueur. Le montant
cautionne est au maximum de 10 millions de FCFA. La caution est accordee uniquement aux
membres de la mutuelle, dans la limite de 5 fois leur participation au capital, pour un cout de
0,5% par semestre. A ce jour, un seul sinistre a ete enregistre (cautionnement d'une avance de
demarrage). Les cautions delivrees par Talmako representent environ le tiers des cautions emises
dans le cadre des operations de Nigetip. Les entreprises peuvent egalement faire emettre des
cautions bancaires traditionnelles dans le secteur bancaire (en particulier: Sonibank, Credit du
Niger, BIA Niger).

Procedures et suivi des operations
20.   Entreprises. Le fichier courant des entreprises, mis A jour en 1996, figure en Annexe 5.
I1 s'etablit actuellement a 428 entreprises. De maniere generale, la mission a constate qu'il etait
impossible pour l'Agence de controler efficacement les declarations des entreprises, et que, &
l'exception des plus connues ou de cas particuliers, il s'agissait d'un classement effectue sur la
base des declarations recues et consignees dans les fiches signaletiques des entreprises. La
mission a souligne qu'il convenait que l'Agence mette en place un systeme de contr6le realiste
afin d'eviter une perte de conflance dans l'utilisation du fichier. Il pourrait s'agir par exemple,
d'un contr6le systematique des entreprises retenues dans les consultations (verification A
posteriori) ou classees aux trois premieres places. Une concertation avec les services de
l'Equipement pourrait egalement permettre, a terme, une harnonisation des fichiers entreprises
maintenus dans les deux institutions. La mission a enfin souligne que I'Agence devait s'efforcer
de garantir une qualite optimale des travaux au travers de leur execution par des entreprises
qualifi6es: il ne s'agit donc pas simplement d'ouvrir ce fichier A un nombre illimite d'entreprises,
mais de trouver un equilibre entre le nombre d'entreprises et le volume de la demande, de
manibre a favoriser la perennite de ces entreprises. La poursuite des activites de formation des
entreprises, interrompue par le manque de fonds sur le Cr6dit initial, doit donc etre
imp6rativement envisagee.
21.   Maltres d'oeuvre. Le fichier courant des maitres d'oeuvre, mis Ajour en 1996, figure en
Annexe 6. II s'etablit actuellement a 57 bureaux d'etudes etlou de controle. Afin de permettre le
renforcement ulterieur de ces maltres d'oeuvre, la mission recommande que les conditions de
mise en place d'une formation adaptee soient identifi&es au plus vite. I1 conviendrait notamment
d'identifier la structure de sa mise en oeuvre et de proposer le ou les plans de formation adaptes
en fonction des faiblesses constatees dans le dispositif, notamment au niveau du controle.
22.   Suivi financier. La mission a 6galement proc6de, avec l'assistance de Sophie Revillion, A
une revue des operations financibres:
- Organisation et des procedures intemes ainsi que des recommandations des auditeurs
sur les derniers exercices,
- Systemes d'information de l'Agence,
- Methodes et outils de suivi en matibre de contr6le budgetaire, informations analytiques
suivi des engagements, et gestion de tresorerie, et
- Revue des Demandes de Remboursement.
23.   L'organisation de l'Agence en services techniques d'une part, services financiers de
l'autre, relies par un service de contr6le de gestion est coherente. Toutefois le rapport des
auditeurs mentionne tres precisement que ces relations sont plus theoriques qu'effectives et qu'il
faudrait ameliorer les transferts d'informations. Le manuel de proc6dures internes etabli lors de
la creation de l'Agence parait desormais obsolete et devra tre remis a jour. On notera que cette
remise Ajour est deja pr6vue dans les prestations d'un consultant selectionne pour la
rationalisation de l'organisation inteme, dans le cadre de la preparation du projet TIPE2.
Projet de Travaux d'Int6ret Public pour l'Emploi - Mission d'Achevement- Avril 1997  Page 6



24.   Un rapport d'analyse des systemes d'information de l'Agence a et realise par ses
services. Il fait notamment ressortir les points suivants:
(a)    Systeme comptable. Le logiciel comptable de l'Agence est le logiciel SAARI.
Ce logiciel est prevu pour le suivi d'une comptabilite g6nerale de type commercial et ne
permet pas les suivis des travaux de construction. Certaines de ses fonctions, disponibles
sur le marche, ne sont pas utilisees par l'Agence: suivi du materiel, suivi des march6s,
suivi de la paie, suivi budgetaire et suivi analytique. Le projet utilise donc ce logiciel
uniquement pour la comptabilite generale de l'Agence. D'autres fonctions importantes,
specifiques A la gestion des projets A fmancement externe ne sont pas disponibles dans ce
logiciel. II s'agit notamment du suivi des operations par bailleurs, des preparations et des
suivis des demandes de remboursement, du suivi des financements par categories de
d6penses, des enregistrements en devises a des taux variables, etc. Une analyse des
operations par bailleur a dui etre faite par un cabinet exteme au 30 juin 1996 et a
demand6, pour etre effectuee, un retraitement de l'ensemble des operations.
(b) Autres systemes. Les bases de donnees de fournisseurs et le suivi des travaux sont
faits sur des programmes developpes en inteme sur Dbase. Les demandes de
remboursement de l'IDA sont faites sur un programme developpe en interne sur Clarion.
Les autres demandes de remboursement sont traitees sur Excel. Le suivi budgetaire
Projet de Travaux d'Intfrtt Public pour l'Emploi - Mission d'Achevement- Avril 1997  Page 7



est fait sur Excel. La paie est suivie sur un programme egalement developpe en interne.
Certaines informations sont ainsi saisies quatre fois de suite.
25.   La rationalisation de la procedure inteme commandee a un consultant externe inclut la
demande de propositions de rationalisation de ces systemes informatiques. La signature du
marche correspondant est innminente. L'Agence devra sans doute choisir entre l'utilisation plus
ou moins satisfaisante d'un ou deux logiciels existant sur le marche ou la creation d'un logiciel
specifique par un Cabinet de programmation. La mod6lisation des besoins a d6jA et6 en grande
partie realisee par l'Agence. La mission recommande que, outre les fonctions de base
indispensables (comptabilite par convention, bailleur, rapprochement comptabilite en FCFA et
decaissements en DTS, soldes A decaisser, etc.), le dispositif retenu permette le suivi analytique
des engagements par marche (travaux, equipements, consultants) de mani6re a justifier les frais
de gestion appliques par l'Agence. En tout etat de cause, la mise au point de la nouvelle
architecture devrait etre une condition de mise en oeuvre du projet TIPE2, l'organisation actuelle
ayant ete rendue obsolete par le developpement des activites de l'Agence. Enfin, la mission
recommande qu'un dispositif de gestion/prevision de la tresorerie, simple d'6laboration et
d'utilisation, soit mis en place pour eviter les goulots d'etranglement. Ceux-ci seront sensibles
notamment d'ici la fin du credit IDA du fait de la procedure de reduction progressive de l'avance
pour fonds de roulement.
26.   Les DRF n°54, 63 et 64 ont et revues integralement. Les demandes semblent etablies et
suivies avec serieux. Toutefois l'Agence presente en remboursement les avances A justifier sur
frais de ddplacement (carburants, entretien vehicules et divers), avant le retour des pieces
justificatives. Les residus sur ces avances sont enregistrees dans la caisse. II a ete signifie a
l'Agence qu'il ne s'agissait pas de depenses eligibles tant que les pieces justificatives ne sont pas
presentables.
27.' Audit. L'Audit des comptes du Projet au 31 decembre 1996 a ete recu par la Banque dans
les delais. Le rapport certifie les comptes de l'Agence, comme dans le pass6. Des suggestions
d'amelioration dans la presentation du rapport d'audit ont
Projet de Travaux d'Int6r6t Public pour l'Emploi - Mission d'Achevement- Avril 1997  Page 8



cependant ete faites dans un courrier separe. La mission recommande qu'elles soient
officiellement communiquees a I'auditeur et effectivement prises en compte dans le prochain
rapport d'audit (audit des comptes au 30 juin 1997, dui au plus tard le 31 aout 1997).

PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
PUBLIC WORKS AND EMPLOYMENT PROJECT
NIGER
(CREDIT 2209-NIR)
1. PREMIER PROJET DE TRAVAUX D'INTERET PUBLIC POUR L'EMPLOI
1.1. INTRODUCTION
Le Gouvemnement du Niger a eu a mener plusieurs programmes d'ajustement structurel a partir des ann6es
1986. Ces differents programmes avaient pour objectif de renforcer les reformes du secteur parapublic, la gestion
des finances publiques et la libdralisation du cadre legislatif du commerce et de l'emploi. Les mesures de
liberalisation ont encourage la concurrence des produits etrangers sur le marche Nigerien, conduisant a la ferneture
des entreprises les moins rentables sans que la reponse du secteur ne se fasse sentir. Le souci d'attenuer les effets
sociaux de l'ajustement structurel fut a l'origine de la mise en oeuvre d'un programme d'actions pour l'incitation au
depart volontaire (PAIPCE). Ce programme visait a dimunuer la masse salariale tout en contribuant a la creation
d'emplois iimmediats. Le Gouvemement du Niger a ainsi compris que l'allegement du cofit social de I'ajustement
structurel ne pourrait comporter uniquement que des programmes d'insertion et de rdinsertion. Pour cette categorie
surtout, une nouvelle approche basee sur des travaux d'interet public a haute intensite de main d'oeuvre pourrait
attenuer le poids de l'ajustement. Ce programme devrait procurer aux jeunes ddsoeuvrds et ch6meurs, une
occupation temporaire et des revenus. A travers ces travaux une experience et une formation elementaire,
pourraient dventuellement servir de tremplin pour une insertion durable sur le marche de l'emploi. L'elaboration du
programme d'actions a fait appel a ta collaboration des ministeres techniques, des ONG, des organisations de
femmes, des groupes de producteurs, des syndicats des travailleurs de petites et moyennes entreprises, du patronat,
des municipalitds et des bureaux d'etudes. Toutes ces parties ont apporte leur contribution dans l'identification et la
formulation des projets du programme dans un cadre conceptuel que le Gouvernement a ddfmi.
La NIGETIP s'est ainsi constituee comme un des elements cles de ce programme.
Le projet confie a cette agence d'execution est le projet de Travaux d'intert Public pour l'Emploi. Il
consiste en la rdalisation de travaux de rehabilitation, de rdalisation, et en services d'amdlioration de
l'environnement communal par le biais de l'entreprise privee locale contribuant ainsi au renforcement du secteur de
la construction et des capacites des municipalites au NIGER.
La NIGETIP devait d6montrer grace a des procedures simplifiees, basees sur la rigueur et sur la
transparence, que des sous-projets pouvaient etre identifies, faire l'objet d'appel d'offres A la concurrence, etre
executes par des P.M.E. capables de crder des emplois qualifies, payer dans des delais reduits, et assurer une
redistribution de revenus au niveau de l'economie. Ce sont ces objectifs que la NIGETIP devrait realiser sur une
p6riode initiale de 3 ans.
1.2. OBJECTIFS DU PROJET
Les eldments du projet sont les suivants:
* un programme de rehabilitation et d'entretien des infrastructures et des services publics qui doit etre execute par
des entreprises locales dans le cadre de sous-projets A haute intensite de main d'oeuvre,
1



* un ensemble de services lies A l'organisation du travail, a la gestion et la formation de la main d'oeuvre qui
doivent etre offerts a titre benevole aux entreprises locales auxquelles des marches seront attribues au titre de
l'element precedent
* un element supervision et suivi pour voir de pres I'avancement du projet et preparer le passage A l'emploi du
groupe cible avec l'appui technique local.
Ainsi un certain nombre d'objectifs generaux ont ete assignes au Projet de Travaux d'Interet Public pour l'emploi:
* creer au moins A titre temporaire, un nombre significatif d'emplois nouveaux principalement dans les zones
urbaines et periurbaines;
* ameliorer A travers l'execution des travaux finances dans le cadre du projet, le savoir-faire de la main d'oeuvre
employee, la competitivite des entreprises chargees des chantiers et I efficacite des institutions publiques
impliquees de facon A d6velopper une meilleure capacite de r6ponse A l'6conomie et a des opportunites de
creation d'emplois durables au-dela de la periode d'execution du projet.
* demontrer la possibilite d'elargir le champ d'application des travaux a haute intensite de main d'oeuvre
employee et mettre au point des procedures qui pourraient etre reprises par le secteur public pour poursuivre
des activites de meme nature;
* executer des travaux dont le resultat sera economiquement et socialement utile
Le projet de Travaux d'interet Public pour l'Emploi a fait l'objet d'un accord de credit signe en date du
05/04/1991. Le coAit total du projet devait etre de 33,3 millions de dollars US dont 20 millions devraient etre
fmances par le Credit CR 2209 NIR de l'IDA (correspondant A 13,9 millions de DTS), le reliquat de 3,3 millions de
dollars par le Gouvemement du Niger et 10 millions de dollars par d'autres bailleurs de fonds .
A l'origine, la date de cl6ture etait prevue pour le 31/12/1994 mais elle a ete reportee jusqu'au 30/06/1997 A la
demande du Gouvernement afin de pennettre a l'Agence d'executer les travaux prevues dans le cadre du credit
supplementaire , signe le 23/12/1994.
Les cofits du projet ont ete ventiles en 5 categories principales precisees en annexe (en plus du remboursement de
l'avance pour la preparation du projet PPF et du poste non-affect6).
Le projet prevu pour etre acheve au bout de 36 mois a dure 66 mois du fait de deux prorogations pour favoriser un
decaissement integral du credit sur la demande de l'Emprunteur avec avis favorables de la Banque et du retard pris
dans la mise en vigueur du credit supplementaire.
L'unite de gestion est une agence d'execution, structure exteme a I'administration centrale, qui a signe une
convention avec le gouvemement du Niger represente par son Ministere de l'Economie et des Finances. Cette
Agence a ete denommee NIGETIP (Agence d'Execution de travaux d'interet Public pour l'Emploi). Elle a
conserve son autonomie pendant toute la duree du projet et devrait perseverer dans ce sens pour les programmes a
venir .
1.3. FORME INSTITUTIONNELLE
LA NIGETIP est une association sur le plan juridique dotee d'un statut d'ONG de droit prive degagee de toute
entrave administrative susceptible de freiner I'accomplissement de sa mission. Elle dispose d'un statut et d'un
reglement interieur. Elle est administree par une assemblee g6nerale presidee par le Directeur General et dont les
membres fondateurs sont: le Syndicat Patronal des Entreprises et Industries du Niger (SPEIN), le Syndicat National
des Petites et Moyennes Entreprises du Niger (SYNAPEMEN), l'Union nationale des Cooperatives (UNC), I'Union
des syndicats des travailleurs du Niger (USTN), I'Association des Femmes du Niger (AFN) et l'Association des
Villes et Communes du Niger (AVCN).
LA NIGETIP est dotee d'un manuel de procedures qui lui permet de respecter les imperatifs de gestion rigoureuse
et efficace. C'est ainsi que l'on peut remarquer:
2



* pour la gestion technique des sous-projets, une grande transparence et une clarte dans les procedures allant de la
presdlection des entreprises, des dossiers d'appel d'offTes, du ddpouillement de ces dossiers, en passant par les
critares d'attribution de marches jusqu'A la reception defmitive des travaux;
* une rapidite dans l'elaboration des documents et signatures des contrats;
*  une souplesse de la structure par son organigramme et une rapidite d'intervention grace a l'outil de gestion
informatise tres efficient;
* un reglement rapide des factures et decomptes apres certification de livraison des travaux et services, une remise
rapide des moyens de paiement sans aucune intervention exterieure;
* Un respect des principes de reference qui sont: independance, impartialite, efficacite et economie.
C'est grace A son Manuel de Procedures que la NIGETIP a pu executer un grand nombre de sous-projets . En
optant pour le faire-faire la NIGETIP a pu disposer d'un r6seau efficace de maitres d'oeuvre (cabinets d'architectes,
bureaux d'ingdnieurs et autres consultants) classifies pour l'execution des marchds.
L'Agence a ddmontr6 un grand dynamisme au cours de l'exdcution du projet au point de realiser d'autres projets
simnilaires A son projet de base pour le compte du Gouvemement du Niger sur ses fonds propres et sur des fonds
alloues par d'autres bailleurs ( FED; OPEP; ACDI; KFW; CFD-FSD; LUX DEVELOPPEMENT...)
FONCTION TECHNIQUE
Le manuel des procedures decrit de la section II a la section V de fa,on claire et precise les modalites de:
* soumission des sous-projets a l'Agence par les beneficiaires
 classement des entreprises et des categories de travaux
* attribution des marches de travaux
* elaboration des contrats de prestations de services,
* 6tudes et supervision des travaux
Ce Manuel de Procedure a fait l'objet en 1995 et 1996 d'un audit realise par un consultant ( DEME); en vue de son
actualisation. Les recommandations issues de cette etude ont ete prises en compte dans la suite des activites de
I'Agence.
La direction technique coordonne l'ensemble de ces activitds et elabore un rapport tous les 2 mois. Ce rapport
d'activites retrace le niveau d'execution du projet par source de financement ainsi que le niveau de decaissement
pour les travaux et les services . Ce rapport est complete, comme indique dans la section VIII du manuel des
proc6dures, par une analyse statistique des sous-projets executes par r6gion geographique, par type de travaux et
par cat6gorie d'entreprise. Cette analyse doit faire ressortir le ratio de main d'oeuvre pour chaque projet executd
entre autre.
AUDIT DES COMPTES DE L'AGENCE
Conformdment a l'article 4 de l'accord de credit 2209-Nir, les comptes de l'Agence sont audites systematiquement
deux fois l'an depuis 1993 par des auditeurs inddpendants (cabinets ABDOU SIDIBE et KPMG-Paris) acceptds par
l'IDA. Ils elaborent A chaque fois un rapport qui est transmis A l'Association dans les ddlais fixds A l'accord de
credit soit deux mois au plus tard apres les dates de cloture des comptes. Ce meme rapport est transmis dans les
memes delais A l'Etat du Niger et les autres Bailleurs de fonds.
CONTROLE INTERNE
Des contr6les intemes sont rdguli6rement effectues par le Controleur de gestion sur les procedures de l'Agence dans
le cadre de la gestion, d'attribution et d'execution des marches et du systeme d'information. Ces controles font
l'objet de rapports intemes incluant des recommandations .
3



DEMARRAGE ET DEROULEMENT DU PROJET
Le projet a demarre avec 1'execution des six sous-projets test contenus dans le rapport d'evaluation. Cette phase
probatoire a permis a I'Agence de mettre a l'epreuve son Manuel des Procedures pour demontrer sa capacite de
mener A bien le Projet. La mission de supervision de la Banque I'a confffme dans ses conclusions en date du 7
fevrier 1992.
La date de cloture initiale prevue pour le 31/12/1994 a ete prorogee jusqu'au 30/06/1997 sur la demande de
1'emprunteur, et apres la signature le 23/12/94 de l'amendement a l'Accord de Credit.
Ainsi ; I'Agence a successivement execute la totalitd de la premiere banque de projet dans le cadre du credit initial;
puis une deuxieme banque de projets identifiee en 1994 (annee de la devaluation du franc CFA) beaucoup plus
orientee vers des realisations d'assainissement ou d'infrastructures sanitaires .Enfm en Septembre 1996 ; le
Gouvernement a demande et obtenu aupres de l'IDA une reaffectation du reliquat du Credit pour r6aliser son
programme prioritaire de renforcement des regies fmancieres et douanieres. Un nouveau portefeuille fut ainsi
identifie et mis en execution a partir d 'Octobre 1996. Cet episode a contribud d'ailleurs a ralentir 1'ex6cution du
programme des travaux de la 2eme banque de projets.
Pendant toute la duree du projet l'Agence a, tous les deux mois transmis un rapport d'activite au Gouvemement du
Niger, A l'IDA et aux autres bailleurs de fonds intervenant dans son programme d'execution. La production de ce
rapport n'ajamnais fait defaut et a permis aux differents bailleurs du projet de suivre le rythme d'execution du projet
qui est un indicateur de performance de l'Agence . Ces rapports d'activites ont permis au Gouvernement de faire le
point sur la politique en matiere d'emplois et de realisations d'infrastructures urbaines A travers le Niger.
Le projet a fait l'objet de plusieurs missions de supervision de la BANQUE et des autres bailleurs de fonds .Elle a
egalement fait l'objet de plusieurs missions d'evaluation de la part de consultants independants dont notamment la
mission d'evaluation A mi-parcours ( BYNENS 1993 ) et la Mission d'evaluation du programme KFW
(FALKENSTEIN 1995).
PRINCIPES DE FONCTIONNEMENT
L'Agence d'Execution des Travaux d'interet Public Pour 1'emploi (NIGETIP), est une structure privee autonome
mise en place pour la gestion du projet. Elle oeuvre en toute transparence suivant des principes d'independance,
d'impartialite, d'efficacite et d'economie. Pour une meilleure realisation de la mission l'Agence agit par le biais
d'une gestion contractuelle avec l'ensemble des acteurs impliques dans le projet. Cette gestion est formalis6e par
des conventions et des contrats. Avec chacun de ses partenaires (benefuciaires, entrepreneurs, maitres d'oeuvres et
consultants), I'Agence definit d&s le depart des regles d 'execution tres precises et des objectifs de fonctionnalit6:
QUALITE - PRIX (resultats de la concurrence) - DELAI. Pour ce faire l'Agence a realise pour le compte des
entreprises et des bureaux d'etudes, un manuel des procedures de passation des marches
1.4. ORGANISATION ET PERSONNEL
La NIGETIP est dirigde par un Directeur General assiste d'un Directeur Technique, d'un Directeur Administratif et
Financier et d'un Controleur de Gestion. Le Directeur General a les pouvoirs les plus dtendus, lui conferant la
facilite d'assurer au mieux le bon fonctionnement de l'Agence. II a l'entiere responsabilite du recrutement du
personnel et de veiller A l'application correcte du reglement interieur. L'Agence est une structure ldgere qui compte
au total 29 personnes dont 17 cadres pour une efficacite de gestion.
Les coAts administratifs ont pu etre maintenu A moins de 6 % du budget total du programme , malgre une nette
dimunition des activites au cours de l'annee 1995 ; conjuguee avec une plus grande dispersion des activites sur
l'ensemble du territoire. Pour la gestion du projet, l'Agence a su rester conforme de facon permanente au Manuel de
Procedures qui fait partie integrante de la convention et de l'accord de credit.

1.5. IDENTIFICATION ET EVALUATION DES SOUS-PROJETS
Dans un premier temps, la NIGETIP a procedd a une large publicite afm de faire connaltre ses procedures telles
qu'elles figurent dans son Manuel de Procedures . Les projets sont soumis A rAgence par les b6neficiaires
(Administrations Centrales, Communes, Collectivit6s Locales, etc.) par le biais de l'UC/DSAfPACSA. Les dossiers
ne sont recevables que lorsqu'ils sont conformes aux crit6res prescrits dans le Manuel de Proc6dures (section 11-4).
Ainsi, en moins de 3 mois une premiere banque de projets fut constituee . L'Agence evalue les projets selon les
criteres decrits dans le Manuel de Procedures (section II-4) et selon une grille multicritere pr6etablie par l'Agence
elle-meme (cf. document multicritere). Une banque de projets sdlectionnes est soumise A rexamen de l'IDA. Une
fois que cette banque de projets est approuv6e par rIDA, I'Agence fait alors appel aux bureaux d'6tudes qui vont, par
le biais des contrats d'etudes techniques, mener les etudes techniques et pr6parer les dossiers d'appels d'offres.
1.6. EXECUTION DES SOUS-PROJETS
Lorsque la faisabilite d'un projet est reconnue et lorsque ce projet est retenu par l'Agence, cela entratne la signature
d'une convention de mattrise d'ouvrage d6leguee entre le maitre d'ouvrage et rAgence, conformement au modele
preetabli (Manuel de Procedures, section II, annexe 1).
Au cours de l'execution, I'Agence a su utiliser des procedures diligentes A toutes les phases: reception des projets,
pr6selection et confection de la banque de projets, soumission a  rexamen de rlIDA, pr6paration des dossiers
techniques des march6s, notification et demarrage des travaux, paiement des decomptes, et suivi technique, etc...
La duree moyenne du s6jour d'un d6compte A l'Agence est de 6 jours pour toute la periode. allant de 1992 A
1995 . Cette duree moyenne a evolue de 3 jours en 1991 et en 1992, a 4 jours 1993, 6 jours en 1994, 9 jours en
1995 pour remonter a 23 jours en 1996 au dernier trimestre. Les raisons sont imputables essentiellement:
- d'abord a la lenteur (dur6e de remboursement de 2 A 3 mois) et A la suspension des decaissements sur le fonds
OPEP en 1996. A ce jour le compte special n'a pas encore ete credite d'un montant de 250 Millions de F CFA
correspondants a deux (2) D.R.F sans tenir compte des decomptes d'entreprise en instance de paiement au sein de
.'Agence.
- puis a la reconstitution pr6coce du fonds de roulement li6e au passage du Credit Initial au credit complementaire .
L'6tude technique d'un projet prend en moyenne un mois et demi (1,5 mois). La preparation de l'appel d'offres
dure deux (2) semaines et l'attribution de march6 deux (2) semaines. Au total, de retude technique A rattribution
ddu marche, on ne compte que deux mois et demi (2,5 mois). En comparaison, P'tude sur les goulots d'etranglements
A Ia consommation des credits dans le secteur du BTP effectuee en 1992, a montr6 que la duree moyenne de
passation d'un marche (du depot des offres jusqu'a l'enregistrement du marche) est de plus de 7 mois dans le secteur
public.
DELAIS D'EXECUTION DES MARCHES
Le projet etant essentiellement orient6 vers le secteur du BTP, la passation des marches revet une importance
capitale. Les imp6ratifs recherch6s etaient : la souplesse, la rapidite, I'economie, la transparence et l'efficacit6. Ces
imperatifs devraient 6tre garantis a travers un manuel des procedures faisant partie integrante de l'accord de credit.
L'Agence a du adopter un certain nombre de documents types:
* modele de marche
* modele de convention de maitrise d'ouvrage deleguee
* modele de contrat de maitrise d'oeuvre
Ces documents types mis au point et annexes au manuel des procedures ont permis  d'atteindre les imperatifs sus-
cites.
L'existence de ces pieces et leur examen permettent de dire que pour l'essentiel, les dispositions du manuel des
procedures sont respectees, en particulier:
5



- la reponse de 5 soumissionnaires au mininum pour un appel d'offres (faute de quoi l'avis de non objection de la
Banque est requis)
- le seuil de 125 millions de FCFA (250 000 USD) au dela duquel l'Agence est tenue de soumettre sa decision a
l'IDA:
Concernant les avis de non objection I'Agence s'est refer6e a la Banque, chaque fois que de besoin en dtait,
avant de notifier sa decision aux soumissionnaires: les methodes et conditions de passation de marchds n'ont pas
pose de problemes majeurs a I'Agence, le manuel des procedures, qui s'inscrit dans le cadre de l'accord de credit,
prend le pas sur la reglementation nationale. Lesdites procddures ont etd largement diffusdes aupres des partenaires
de I'agence (Maftres d'oeuvre, entrepreneurs, ben6ficiaires) a l'occasion des missions que l'Agence effectue a cet
effet ou des cessions de formation. L'Agence a a cette fin confectionn6 et diffus6 les documents suivants:
* manuel de procedures de passation de marche
* tdr pour les etudes de realisation du dossier d'appel d'offres
* tdr pour les controles des travaux
Par ailleurs, les prix resultant des appels d'offres de l'Agence sont de 10 a 15% plus bas que ceux ddcoulant
d'appels d'offres de meme natures lances par I' administration centrale et ses demembrements.
Un des points forts de l'Agence est le traitement rapide des factures (ddcomptes) et leur paiement aux entreprises.
La duree moyenne du sejour d'un d6compte a l'Agence est de 6 jours. Pour certaines p6riodes de I 'annee 1993 nous
avons meme eu des durees de 1 jour. Le delai exige comme critere de performance est normalement de 10 jours. II
a dte demontre par ailleurs que cette rapidite dans le paiement des decomptes est un facteur important d'economie
pour les entrepreneurs. C'est egalement un element positif dans l'etablissement de rapport de confiance entre
l'Agence et ses partenaires et du renforcement de l'int*r& tres vif que ces demniers manifestent aux des activit6s de
l'Agence.
Concemant 1'execution des marches, il y a quelques cas de depassement de delais qui sont dus & de nombreux
facteurs exogenes, dont notamment la procedure d'exoneration des mat6riaux importes et les frequentes ruptures de
stock de ces materiaux sur le marche. Malgre tous ces aleas on peut estimer a moins de 15 % les cas de ddpassement
de delais contractuel d'execution des marches.
1.7. REALISATIONS
La NIGETIP en aidant les Communes, I'Administration Centrale, les Autorites Locales a realiser un programme
d'entretien, de rehabilitation et de construction d'infrastructures urbaines, contribue et renforce les capacitds
techniques et gestionnelles du secteur prive, notamment les petites et moyennes entreprises et les bureaux d'etudes
du secteur du batiment et travaux publics. Ce qui se traduit par la crdation directe et indirecte d'emplois, dans la
mesure ou ces entreprises et bureaux d'etudes engagent des travailleurs peu ou non specialises et des techniciens
pour executer les sous-projets.
856 entreprises nationales sont pre-qualifiees parmi celles-ci 164 ont ete attributaires de marches au titre du
programme regulier.
La passation des marches a fait l'objet de 6 appels d'offres en 1991 ; 87 AO en 1992; 83 AO en 1993 ; 200 AO
en 1994; 35 AO en 1995; 178 AO en 1996 et 43 AO en 1997 ; soit un total de 632 AO sur toute la periode ,c'est a
dire de 1991 a fm Juin 1997.
5200 dossiers ont e vendus lors des lancements de ces appels d'offre entre 1991 et 1996.
919 marches de travaux ont pu ainsi etre attribues pour un montant de 21 586 923 885 F CFA dont 803 sont
termnins et receptionnes pour un montant de 20,1 milliards F CFA. ParTni ces marches attribues la part des
avenants reprdsentent seulement 2,9% des montants.
49 974 emplois sont crees avec une masse salariale correspondante de 5.439 904 596 F CFA pour une dur6e
moyenne de 53 jours chacun.
6



Un ratio moyen de main d'oeuvre de 25,2 % a ete obtenu pour 1'ensemble de ces realisations .
84 mattres d'oeuvre ont pu etre preselectionnes dont 45 ont eu des contrats avec l'Agence qui les a fait travailler
sur 443 contrats d'etudes et 559 contrats de contrBle des travaux. Le montant des honoraires s'6levent a 1 993 971
549 F CFA.
En six ans d'activite, la NIGETIP a realis6 des travaux de:
* drainage de points bas pour un montant de 6,095 milliards de f CFA
*1 entretien et rehabilitation d'infrastructures urbaines: 1,950 milliards de f CFA
* construction d'edifices simples pour un montant de 10,373 milliards de f CFA
* reparation et demolition de batiment pour un montant de 1,976 milliards de f CFA
* le reste conceme les travaux de debroussaillage et de terrassement, CES/DRS, defense et restauration des sols,
travaux de nettoyage du patrimoine public, d'entretien public, et de plantation d'espace vert.
Les procedures transparentes de passation des marches, le delai reduit des paiements des decomptes (ce
delai est en moyenne de 6 jours) ont e  des elements positifs dans l'etablissement de relations de confiance entre
lAgence et ses partenaires, entrainant ainsi un interet particulier de ces derniers vis-A-vis des activites de l'Agence.
Les engagements au titre du projet TIPE s'!levent A 6.315.540.100 F CFA tandis que celui au titre du credit
complementaire s'6leve A 4.532.642.640 F CFA. Ainsi donc sur l'ensemble du credit IDA 9.464.032.652 F CFA
ont ete d6caiss6s, ce qui donne un taux de decaissement de 85 %. Cela demontre que l'Agence a une capacit6
importante d'absoption de credit.
FORMATION ET ASSISTANCE TECHNIQUE AUX ENTREPRISES
Le programme triennal d'assistance aux P.M.E. du secteur des BTP a permis de former un nombre relativement
6leve de chefs d'entreprises, techniciens et agents d'execution des P.M.E. offrant leurs services A la NIGETIP. Au
total 793 chefs d'entreprises, techniciens et agents d'execution des P.M.E. ont assiste aux modules techniques
dispenses au cours des 3 ans et 250 chefs d'entreprises ont participe aux modules de gestion. Cette formation a
permis aux entreprises d'acquerir un savoir-faire dans l'execution des ouvrages. Elle a pris fm avec le credit initial
Par la suite dans le cadre de la Cooperation Nigero-Allemande , une session de formation de bureaux d'etude a ete
organisee . Ainsi plus d'une vingtaine de bureaux d'etude (24 plus precisement) ont ete formes pendant 2 semaines
sur les themes de la planification des projets, l'etablissement des DAO pour les projets NIGETIP, une initiation aux
techniques de construction en materiaux locaux .
En somme, la NIGETIP a demontre comment l'autonomie de gestion et l'orientation vers le secteur prive
apportaient d'excellents resultats.
IMPACT DU PROJET SUR L'ENVIRONNEMENT MACRO ECONOMIQUE
1. Impact sur l'am6lioration des conditions de vie des populations
L'6valuation a mi-parcours du projet realisee par le Cabinet Bynens ainsi que l'etude de l'impact de la NIGETIP
realisee par le consultant SIMON OUEDRAGO ont montre qu!en 66 mois d'activites, I'Agence a contribu6
fortement A la creation d'emplois, a la reduction de la pauvrete et a l'attenuation des effets de l'ajustement structurel.
Ces constations a mi-parcours ont ete confmnrmes par l'evaluation du programme KFW en 1995 realisee par
FALKEINTEN (VOIR COMMENTAIRE SIMON OUEDRAOGO)
Du debut du projet A Juin 1997 , 49 974 emplois ont ete crees pour la plupart au benefice d' ouvriers non ou peu
qualifies, pour une masse salariale de 5 439 904 596 F CFA.
7



Sur la base des enquetes sur le terrain, l'evaluation a fait ressortir que tous les projets realises repondent a des
besoins reellement ressentis par les beneficiaires institutionnels et apportent aux beneficiaires utilisateurs une tres
nette am6lioration du cadre de vie. C'est ainsi que les travaux d'assainissement par exemple ont permis d'ameliorer
de facon tres sensible les conditions de vie de milliers d'habitants des quartiers urbains auparavant tres insalubres.
Les infrastructures sanitaires construites par l'Agence ont permis une amelioration de la couverture sanitaire. La
construction de centaines de classes sur d'autres credits que l'IDA 2209 ont eu un impact sur le taux de
scolarisation. Enfm la construction d'infrastructures marchandes (bloc sanitaires, marches, autogares, etc...) ont
permis aux collectivites territoriales d'ameliorer leurs recettes.
Toutes ces realisations ont etd faites en harmonie avec les programmes nationaux, ce qui a permis leur mise en
exploitation immediate par la disponibilite de personnels qualifies ( infirmiers et instituteurs... etc) .
2. Impact sur le secteur du BTP
L'evaluation a montre que l' impact de l'Agence sur le developpement et la consolidation des P.M.E. du BTP est une
r6alit6 indeniable.
On compte aujourd'hui 428 moyennes et petites entreprises qualifiees dont 157 ont ete attributaires d'au moins un
march6. Elles ont pu beneficier ainsi de 919 marches attribu6s pour un montant de plus de 21 milliards de F CFA.
Cela fait en moyenne 133 millions de F CFA par entreprise attributaire.
Sur la base des enquetes aupres des entreprises, le rapport SIMON a montre que de nombreuses entreprises
attributaires affirment avoir consolide leur entreprise, ameliorb leur competitivite grace aux r6f6rences et aux
methodes d'organisation acquises lors des suivis des chantiers NIGETIP. Certaines ont pu investir et employer du
personnel permanent.
Egalement l'Agence a fait travailler au 30 Juin 1997, 45 bureaux d'etudes techniques et cabinets d'architectes pour
une enveloppe de contrats signes de pres de 2,milliards F CFA. Certains affirment avoir consolide leur societe et
ameliore leur competitivite en acquerant des ref6rences et des techniques nouvelles & travers les contrats de
NIGETIP. II est important de noter qu'il y avait seulement 4 bureaux d'6tudes avant la crdation de NIGETIP. La
part de contrats octroyee par la NIGETIP a ces bureaux d'etude varie de 75 a 100 % de leur chiffre d'affaire.
L'Agence est arrivee a un point oii son experience est concluante et replicable. Par son experience et son
dynamisme, elle a pu s'agrandir, diversifier ses actions et s'6largir geographiquement. Cette capacite a d'adaptation
et sa souplesse lui ont permis de travailler efficacement dans les zones reputees dangereuses du nord du pays.
Impacts institutionnels
Les performances reelles dans l'environnement instable du pays a fait que l'Agence est devenue sur le plan national
une reference en matiere de gestion des projets. De nombreuses structures (ONG, Administration, Projets...)
consultent l'Agence pour s'inspirer de ses procedures ou solliciter un appui technique.
Au niveau des communes, l'intervention de l'Agence a amend celles-ci a prendre conscience de la necessite d'avoir
une organisation planifiee des realisations et de I 'entretien de leurs infrastructures. L'apport de l'Agence a ete
deterninante dans la gdneralisation de la formule de gerance libre des ouvrages marchands (marches, autogares,
blocs sanitaires publics).
Sur le plan sous regional, NIGETIP etant la deuxieme Agence creee apres I'AGETIPE Senegal, ses resultats ont
convaincus les bailleurs de fonds a etendre cette experience a plusieurs autres pays de la sous region. C'est ainsi que
furent creees des Agences similaires au Burkina Faso, au Mali, au Benin, en Gambie, en Mauritanie, au Tchad, au
Togo et a Madagascar.
Impact environnemental
L'analyse des premieres banques de projets executes par l'Agence montre que la plupart des ses r6alisations ont
pour objectif de:
- ameliorer les conditions d'hygiene et de sante des quartiers insalubres
- limiter la degradation de l'environnement
- lutter contre les inondations
8



- ameliorer la praticabilite des voies de desserte.Cela demontre l'impact positif des realisations de l'Agence sur
1'environnement. Pour ameliorer les performances dans ce domaine, une etude est en cours: elle se propose
d'analyser et evaluer l'impact environnemental des ouvrages deja realises par NIGETIP afm de fournir des
indicateurs pour la mise en place d'un guide pour la realisation des etudes d'impact environnemental pour les
futurs projets que l'Agence executera dans le cadre du Projet de Rehabilitation des Infrastructures (PRI).
Innovation technologique
Dans son souci d'ameliorer le ratio de main-d'oeuvre et de promouvoir les materiaux locaux, I'Agence a
beaucoup contribue A revaloriser les constructions en brique de laterite stabilisee (BLS), en banco cru et en moellons
de pierre ou en laterite induree. A travers un programme de coistruction de plusieurs dispensaires ruraux, de classes
et de cl6ture d'infrastructures scolaires ou sanitaires, I'Agence a initie et realise le plus grand programme
d'utilisation de materiaux locaux jamais entrepris au Niger. La r-altrise de cette technologie par certains bureaux
d'etudes et certains tacherons est telle que des particuliers commencent a l'adopter ainsi  d'ailleurs que
l'administration.
Malgre ces succes reconnus A l'Agence, il y a cependant des insufflsances que les differents audits et evaluations ont
relevees.
1.9. LES LECONS DE L'EXPERIENCE
Les resultats des differents niveaux de suivi et les evaluations a mi-parcours (evaluation socio-economique, mission
d'audit comptable, fmanciere de gestion) ont permis de mener une reflexion tout au long de l'execution du projet. Ce
qui avait pour but de decouvrir quelques points forts et points faibles pour ainsi ameliorer les uns et corriger les
autres.
1. POINTS FORTS
a) Mattrise d'Ouvrage DeI)gu6e
Elle a permis de realiser effectivement les differents ouvrages et avec une rapidite d'execution, toute chose qui
participe A une absorption rapide des credits alloues.
b) la gerance libre des ouvrages
c) la sensibilisation aupres des ben6ficiaires
d) Constitution d'une expertise locale
La formation des maitres d'oeuvre, le suivi des chantiers par ceux-ci et la segmentation des marchds pour toucher un
plus grand nombre d'entreprises prequalifiees, ont permis de constituer une expertise locale qui participeront avec
plus d'efficacite A l'execution des projets A venir.
e) Analyse multicrit0res dans la selection des projets
L'elaboration et la mise en application d'une grille multicritere dans l'analyse et la sdlection des projets a permis
d'aboutir a un systeme de choix beaucoup plus affin6 des projets.
f) La vulgarisation de l'utilisation des materiaux locaux dans l'ex6cution des ouvrages
Le souci de promouvoir l'utilisation des materiaux locaux, de realiser les ouvrages A moindre cofit, de crder le plus
d'emplois et de reduire la sortie de devises a conduit l'Agence A faire deux etudes sur l'utilisation des materiaux
locaux. Ces etudes se sont averees concluantes et des materiaux locaux sont utilises dans la realisation d'ouvrages,
notamment des caniveaux , des petits batiments et murs de cl6ure.
g ) La haute utilisation de la main d'ouevre peu qualifi6e
Un des objectifs de l'agence a ete atteint car les chiffres obtenus ( ratio de main d'oeuvre et part salariale ) sont
sup6rieurs aux estimations.
9



2. POINTS FAIBLES
a) Selection et evaluation des projets
L'Agence doit trouver un mecanisme permettant aux beneficiaires de niieux formuler les projets en ce qui conceme
les priorites et les coats de realisations correspondants et conformement aux procedures de NIGETIP.
Elle doit veiller encore plus sur la qualite des 6tudes. 11 est donc necessaire que les prestations des bureaux d'6tudes
soient plus detaillees et comprennent les plans d'execution et des ri tres plus fiables. II est necessaire et inportant
egalement que les etudes du sol pour les fondations soient faites pour garantir des quantitds les plus exactes
possibles.dans les calculs de structures.
II serait tres commode et avantageux de modifier les procedudes afin d'etablir l'execution des travaux sur rann6e et
obtenir ainsi un meilleur plan de charge des maitres d'oeuvres, des entreprises et l'Agence elle-m8me. Ce qui
commande d'eviter de selectionner les projets en une seule fois par an.
Les beneficiaires utilisateurs doivent etre pris en compte dans le processus de mise en place des sous-projets. DMs la
preselection des projets presentes par les beneficiaires institutionnels, iis feront l'objet d!une reflexion-animation
avec la population utilisatrice afin de l'impliquer des la formulation et d'examiner avec elle les possibilites de leur
participation. Cela pourrait contribuer fortement quant a l'entretien des ouvrages.
b) L'impact des sous-projets
L'impact des sous-projets n'est pas mis en evidence dans les dossiers des projets present6s par les b6n6ficiaires. Cela
,tant la raison d'etre meme des projets, il convient que rAgence considere cet aspect dans les criteres de choix des
projets car it oriente quant au caractere prioritaire du projet.
c) Passation des march6s
L'Agence prend depuis quelques temps en cc,mpte la capacite restante des entreprises. It s'est avere qu'il est aussi
nrcessaire et important de revoir a la hausse le temps accorde aux entreprises pour pr6parer les offres. une plus
grande importance doit etre accordee aux capacites prouvees de 1'entreprise pour I'attribution des marches .
d) Financement de la contrepartie et suspension du cr6dit OPEP
Le gouvemement a tarde a debloquer le financement de la contrepartie nationale.
Le Niger a ete suspendu des fonds OPEP. Cette suspension concerne aussi 1'Agznve dont la reputation de paiement
des decomptes dans des d6lais record a pris un coup. Des travaux en cours actuellement sont arret6s et des
decomptes totalisant plus de 500 millions de francs CFA se trouvent en instance de paiement.
e) Formation des entrepreneurs et des ma^itres d'oeuvre.
Une composante assistance technique aux entreprises et aux bureaux d'dwdes doit etre inclue dans chaque
programme.
