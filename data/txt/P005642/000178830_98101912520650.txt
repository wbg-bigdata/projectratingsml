INTRODUCTION
(i.)      Since Tunisia became independent in 1956, the Government has
emphasized the development of the country's human resources and, in parti-
cular, the health of the population. With health expenditures averaging
close to 2.5% of GDP since independence, Tunisia's health system has registered
impressive gains, as demonstrated by an increase in life expectancy at birth
from 41 years in 1956 to 57 in 1978, a fall in the crude birth rate from 49
to 32 per thousand, and a decline in infant mortality from 202 to 123 per
thousand. Nevertheless, the persistence of potentially controllable diseases,
of high infant mortality and malnutrition, and a loss of momentum of the
public family planning program, indicate that the system must be improved to
better meet the needs of people in rural areas and in the poor parts of urban
areas.
(ii.)     Tunisia's health sector is in transition.  Health services have
hitherto been based on hospitals in urban areas, and had taken the form of
curative, as opposed to preventive care, with disproportionate attention to
the urban as opposed to the rural population. Apart from this disparity
between urban and rural areas, there are still great differences between
regions in the per capita supply of hospital beds, physicians and nurses and
the effectiveness of the referral system. In rural areas, only about 50% of
the population enjoys access to modern facilities. Yet, in urban areas, the
system is quite sophisticated, and hospital beds, obstetricians, family
planning counsellors, physicians and nurses are readily available. This
imbalance is reflected in the higher fertility and infant mortality rates in
rural areas. Both doctors and paramedicals are trained to provide specialized
medicine and curative care of a kind only feasible in the better-off urban
areas, whereas the health status of the urban poor and the vast majority of
country dwellers can only be improved effectively by generalists trained in
health education and prevention, backed up by an adequate referral system.
(iii.)    In recent years the Government has focused attention on this problem
and, encouraged by the results of pilot projects, has shifted the emphasis of
the public health system from curative to preventive care, and is extending
its reach into unserved or underserved areas, by a greatly increased reliance
on appropriately trained paramedicals. The Government is strongly committed
to this health policy which is also supported by local communities. The
administration of health, nutrition and family planning services has been
integrated and decentralized. The proposed project would help the Government
of Tunisia to put these important changes of emphasis and structure into
effect.

I. HEALTH, POPULATION AND NUTRITION IN TUNISIA
A. Health, Population and Nutrition Conditions and Programs
Health
1.01      Since 1969, the Government of Tunisia has made great progress
in developing its public health services and in improving the health of the
people. Vaccination and other preventive campaigns have brought communicable
diseases such as typhus, typhoid and malaria largely under control.. Neverthe-
less, a number of potentially controllable diseases such as tuberculosis,
gastrointestinal and respiratory infections, influenza, hepatitis, skin
and eye diseases, are still prevalent, largely as a result of serious defi-
ciencies in the health system as well as of insanitary enviromnent and
ignorance of hygiene.
1.02      Although life expectancy at birth has increased from 41 years in
1956 to 57 years in 1978, infant mortality ranges from 70 in uTrban to 170 per
thousand in rural areas, giving an average of 123, which is high in comparison
with similar middle-income countries. While some diseases of infancy and
childhood (polio, diphtheria, whooping-cough and measles) are declining as a
result of immunization, airborne, waterborne and nutrition-related diseases
are still prevalent. Lack of pre-natal and post-natal care, especially in
rural areas, where most births go unattended, and malnutrition of both mothers
and children increase the susceptability of infants to disease. Polluted
water is a principal cause of infectious diseases such as hepal'itis and
typhoid. Intestinal parasites such as E.coli, trichinosis, and amoeba are
especially prevalent among school-age children. About half of all deaths in
Tunisia are of children under five, and about half of all child deaths occur
during the first year of life. Premature births, which accouni: for 10 percent
of infant deaths in hospitals and more in rural areas with no access to health
services, are related to the poor health of the mothers. Poor health and
malnutrition result in high drop-out and repeater rates in primary schools and
contribute to the low productivity of labour, especially in agiciculture.
1.03      In the early 1970s Tunisian public health policy was still empha-
sizing hospital-based curative medicine and gave insufficient attention to
prevention. The Government constructed large urban hospitals, and trained
highly specialized medical staff. New hospital construction, planned without
adequate consideration of financial and manpower implications, was at the
expense of primary health care, where diagnosis, treatment and referral
remain below standard. Because the rural population lies largely outside the
referral system, the public health program needed reorientation.
1.04      A 1980 Bank report, entitled Tunisia:  Social Aspects of Development,
pointed out that the availability of health services appeared to be strongly
correlated with the per capita income of the various regions. Great inter-
regional differences in the per capita supply of hospital beds, obstetricians,
physicians and nursing personnel exist. Also, since regional and general
hospitals are located in the towns, there are great differences between urban



and rural areas in the availability of medical treatment. Moreover, because
of the uneven distribution and poor functioning of dispensaries, a large
proportion of the rural poor lacks ready access to basic health services
(Annex 3C). The poor functioning of the referral system is indicated by the
fact that, at the district level the average hospital occupancy rate is about
30%, at the regional level about 70%, while in largest cities hospital
capacity is often overtaxed by patients who have bypassed the first two
levels. Other factors contributing to these unequal occupancy rates are an
insufficient awareness on the part of the rural population of its health
needs, inadequate patient screening and processing by health workers, and the
inadequate peripheral health infrastructure.
1.05      In Tunisia, public health services are provided virtually free in
both urban and rural areas. Private physicians and clinics are however found
only in towns, although decreasing emigration and slower growth of demand
for medical services in urban areas have caused some self-employed physicians
and nurses to move closer to rural areas. At present there is about one
physician for every 3,650 people in Tunisia (ranging from 1/1,465 in Tunis to
1/11,000 in the governorate of Zaghouan). Only 70% of the total population
has access to safe water.  Although most urban households have access to
piped potable water, and are connected to a waste disposal system, the
national water supply company rarely serves rural settlements, which rely
mainly on public wells (76% of all localities in Tunis region, 40-50% in
other regions) or individual water tanks. In rural areas, 60-70% of public
wells are inspected and chlorinated systematically, but in remote settlements
the proportion is much lower (25% in Medenine, Jendouba and Gafsa; 14% in the
isolated settlement of Beja).
1.06      In the mid-seventies, the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), realizing
that a different approach was needed, conducted a number of successful pilot
projects designed to show how, by giving more emphasis to preventive medicine
and the use of paramedicals, better health services could be provided in rural
areas (see para. 2.13). The MOPH has started to strengthen its infrastructure
in peripheral rural areas and to combine the provision of public health,
family planning and nutrition services, hitherto done by several agencies.
In order to meet the requirements of the reorganized service delivery system
in terms of quantity and quality, the training of medical and paramedical
personnel is being revised.
Population and Family Planning
1.07      Official estimates based on the 1975 census put the total population
of Tunisia at 6.3 million in mid-1980, with a current rate of growth of 2.2%
per annum, expected to fall to 2.1% by 1986. The rate of growth actually
increased from 2.0% in 1961 to 2.8% in 1968, and then declined to 2.3% in
1978 partly as a consequence of emigration. The general fertility rate
declined substantially, from an average of 200 live births per thousand women
of reproductive age during the 1960s, to 155 per thousand in 1976. Con-
sequently, the crude birth rate fell from 49 per thousand in 1960 to 32 in
1978, the lowest among Arab countries.



-4-
1.08      Under-reporting in the civil registration system, especially in
rural areas, makes it difficult, however, to assess actual trends in fertility
and mortality. In recent years, both official and unofficial services have
produced a wide range of estimates. The Ministry of Planning and Finance has
recently begun a new analysis of current trends for the preparation of its
sixth development plan. Preliminary results now suggest that population
growth since 1975 has averaged 2.6% per annum, a rate much higher than expected,
largely because of a reversal of the traditional migration pattern and a
rapid decline of mortality, especially of infants. Recession in Europe and
political events in Arab countries have virtually stopped traditional emigra-
tion and caused significant returns of nationals (with their families) work-
ing abroad. By the year 2001, the population is projected to grow to 10 mil-
lion, assuming a regular decline in the net reproduction rate (number of
daughters, per woman, who would survive to the mean age of child bearing)
from an estimated 2.2 in 1980 to 1.15; if fertility remains unchanged, the
population would exceed 12 million.
1.09      The remarkable reduction in the fertility rate was largely due to
the success of the Tunisian Family Planning Program (TFPP), iritiated as the
first in Africa in 1964. The success of the TFPP made Tunisia. a model and a
training ground for Francophone Africa and Arab countries. In order to
expand and improve the program, the National Office of Family Planning and
Population (ONPFP), a semi-autonomous organization under the FOPH, was created
in 1973. In spite of some opposition to abortion and sterilization, the
TFPP has enjoyed broad political, religious and legislative support, and has
been able to achieve a dramatic transformation in family planning knowledge,
attitudes and practice in Tunisia. The ONPFP has formulated a family planning
policy and introduced a wide range of programs, particularly in the areas of
information, education, personnel training, research and evaluation. The
ONPFP provided services not only through its own facilities, but also those of
the MOPH, especially the latter's Maternal and Child Health (NCH) Centers.
Although these services have for the most part served better-off groups, the
TFPP deserves much credit for the decline in the crude birth rate. The 1978
National Fertility Survey showed that 92% of all married women of reproductive
age (MWRA) knew of, and 43% had used, at least one method of family planning.
In 1979, the annual number of family planning consultations in the ONPFP's
facilities passed the 535,000 mark, corresponding to the ONPFP estimate of
137,000 protected MWRA and 50,000 averted births. Taking into account family
planning services provided by private physicians, the estimated total number
of protected MWRA was 180,000 which corresponds to about 63,000 averted births
a year, equivalent to about 19% of actual births. The national prevalence
rate in 1979 for MWRA between the ages of 15 to 49 was 21.3% (16.2% through
the ONPFP program alone).
1.10      A wide range of contraceptive methods characterizes the Tunisian
family planning program. Around 83% of acceptors rely on IUDs, pills,
abortion and tubal ligations. IUDs, inserted free, are most widely used
(34%), followed by oral contraceptives (31%) distributed free by the ONPFP and
sold at a small nominal fee in pharmacies, and abortions (25%) which are legal
and free of charge. Female sterilizations represent more than 10% of new
acceptors.



-5-
1.11      While great strides have been made in reducing fertility among women
under 30 years of age (largely due to increasing age at marriage), there
remains a large unmet demand by women in their 30s and 40s who are still at
risk of pregnancy and are not receiving contraceptive services. The activities
of the ONPFP are supported by a very active information and education campaign
which included, in 1979, 80 articles in local publications, 208 radio programs,
4 television programs and a large number of conferences and seminars backed by
audio-visual materials. However, ONPFP services are largely confined to the
urban population. Rural women, who form about 50% of the target group of
MWRA, account for less than a third of those served by ONPFP. Because of this
urban bias, fertility is generally one-third higher in rural than in urban
areas.
1.12      Since 1977, the official family planning program has been falling
short of its targets of new acceptors. Recent evaluations by USAID and UNFPA
revealed that the rate of increase of new acceptors served by the public
sector program has slowed. However, this shortfall in the public sector was
largely compensated for by the increasingly important role of the private
sector as shown below:

Source: ONPFP.
1.13      The shortfalls of the public sector program are largely due to the
logistical problems which the ONPFP is facing in its efforts to extend services
to rural areas, after having largely satisfied urban demand, rather than to a



lack of potential demand. Tunisia now finds itself in an unusual situation:
the well designed information and education program has had a successful
impact on the entire population, but was not accompanied by a parallel
expansion of family planning service delivery in rural areas. While the
major urban centers are well served, three-fourths of all eligible couples
largely in rural areas are still not able to take full advantage of family
planning. Thus the unmet demand remains great, and has emerged each time
family planning information and services were made more accessible. The
recent evaluation of the Contraceptive Household Distribution Project carried
out in the Sfax region from 1976 to 1979, with USAID support, clearly demon-
strated that family planning practice could be dramatically increased among a
dispersed and largely illiterate rural population. After only two years, the
proportion of married women aged 15 to 44 practicing family planning rose
drastically from 6.6% to 17.7%; the pregnancy rate for women of reproductive
age fell from 20.3% to 17.0%; over one-half of all women practicing contracep-
tion had received a tubal ligation. An encouraging finding for future
program expansion is that family planning acceptance and use varied little
according to the level of education of the woman, and not at all according to
that of the husband, and there was also little association with the husband's
occupation. Finally, the project demonstrated that contraceptive distribution
in rural Tunisia is both socio-culturally acceptable as well as logistically
and administratively feasible. These findings have been especially useful in
the design of the integrated health delivery system.
1.14      The main deficiencies in family planning service delivery identi-
fied by UNFPA and USAID are: a critical shortage of medical and paramedical
services in rural areas; inadequate monitoring and supervision. by ONPFP
of field activities, and logistical and financial constraints keeping the
ONPFP from expanding into rural area. The USAID study also pointed to the
need for an integrated program in which family planning services would be
offered together with basic health care as a means of extending the outreach
of the family planning program and thus reviving its flagging momentum.
Furthermore, in order to ensure that family planning services are not diluted
as a result of their integration into basic health services, a close monitor-
ing of family planning efforts will be needed.
1.15      The Bank concurs with this assessment, and the propcsed project is
designed to support MOPH's new integration policy. But for integration to be
successful, it must result in a strengthening and expansion of both family
planning and basic health services throughout rural Tunisia. If the crude
birth rate is to fall to the Fifth Plan target rate of 30 per thousand in
1986, the proportion of protected MWRA (15-49) must be quickly increased to
about 30%, from 21% in 1979. The Government has decided that all public
health services, including family planning, will be provided by MOPH staff
through MOPH channels, and that the ONPFP will therefore confine itself to
its original functions of policy formulation, research, education and train-
ing. The integration of health and family planning activities, already under-
way in the medical regions of Sousse and Jendouba, is essential if the
government is to extend its family planning program effective]y throughout
rural Tunisia.



-7-
Nutrition
1.16      Malnutrition, although diminishing, is still common.  The fact that,
in terms of percentages of minimum requirements, the average per capita supply
of calories and protein is satisfactory conceals wide differences between
groups and areas as well as specific dietary deficiencies. The results of the
1980 National Food Consumption and Nutrition Survey will only be available in
late 1981, but a similar survey in 1975, showed that on the average, Tunisians
consumed about 2,543 calories per capita per day (115% of the recommended
requirement) and 72 g protein (180% of the recommended intake). Only at
income levels below 100 dinars (US$240) per year did caloric intake fall
below the recommended intakes, and only below 30-60 dinars did protein in-
take become deficient, especially in urban areas. About 14% of the population
in 1975 were unable to cover their minimum daily caloric intake requirement.
This percentage corresponds closely with the 17% of the population below the
absolute poverty threshold in 1975. Malnutrition was a more severe problem
in urban Tunisia, where 18% of the population were unable to meet their
caloric requirements, compared with only 9% in rural areas. According to
the 1975 consumption survey, poor and malnourished people can be found in
all occupations, self-employed and hired workers alike. They are in the
mainstream of economic activity, but with low productivity and/or large
families.
1.17      Vitamin and mineral deficiencies were more widespread than calorie
or protein deciciencies, but it is not known how severe these deficiencies
were. The 1975 survey suggests that well over half of Tunisia's population
were consuming less than the recommended intakes of Vitamin B (riboflavin),
calcium, Vitamin A, and iron. Clinically, about 20% of the cgildren surveyed
in 1975 showed signs of riboflavin and iron deficiencies, and about 9% signs
of rickets, which are indicative of Vitamin D deficiency. About 55% of the
children surveyed nationwide showed evidence of stunted growth, but only 10%
of them showed signs of severe malnutrition. In 1979 about 70% of children
hospitalized suffered from various forms of malnutrition. Most of the
severe cases were in very poor urban areas, where poor sanitation and unstable
family situations predominate.   Anemia caused by iron and folate deficiencies,
and exacerbated by some parasitic infestations, was reported to affect nearly
half of Tunisia's women of child-bearing age and nearly one quarter of the
children, especially in the North West and in the Tunis area.
1.18      The Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology (INNTA), a semi-
autonomous organization under MOPH, was created in 1969. With external
assistance from USAID, FAO, WHO, UNICEF, SIDA and the Canadian Government,
the INNTA's main activities are: nutrition research; assessment of the
nutritional status of children below five years of age and of pregnant
and lactating women; and assessment of regional food supplies in order
to facilitate the setting of agricultural production targets. The INNTA
has also organized applied nutrition programs, covering: nutrition education,
primarily through the mass media; distribution of weaning food for severe
cases of malnutrition; and distribution of vitamins, iron tablets and iodized
salt.



- 8 -
1.19      A staff of 140 INNTA nutritionists is attached to the MCH clinics
to carry out the supplementary feeding and nutrition education. programs. The
scope of this vertical program in rural areas is limited by lack of logistical
support and trained field personnel. Tunisia's Office des Cereales produces
a high protein, high calorie weaning food, Saha, for the supplementary feeding
program and commercial distribution. Through CARE and CRS, USAID has also
been funding a maternal/child feeding project. In 1979 this program reached
about 180,000 children between two and five years and pregnant and lactating
women, particularly in small towns and rural areas; it provided flour, blended
foods and oil. The largest child feeding program is a primary school lunch
program which reached about 260,000 needy children age 6-12 in. 1979, close to
26% of total enrollment. This program is also conducted in cooperation with
CARE, CRS and the Tunisian Government. In addition a "food for work" program
supported by the World Food Program improves the nutrition of about 55,000
workers a year and several times as many dependents. These various feeding
programs are supported by a successful radio nutrition education campaign
designed to modify people's habits, with particular emphasis on improved
methods of child feeding.
1.20      As in the case of family planning services, the Government decided
to make the applied nutrition program an integral part of the public health
services and to use MOPH channels and staff for delivery. The training
of MOPH personnel in nutrition is already taking place, following curricula
prepared by the National Institute of Child Health (INE) and the INNTA. This
reorganization of program delivery should expend its coverage, particularly
in rural areas, and thereby address more effectively the problem of widespread
nutritional anemia as well as moderate-to-severe malnutrition still affecting
up to 20% of Tunisia's children below the age of six years.
B.   Financing of Health, Population and Nutrition Activities
1.21      Total health expenditure in the public sector amounted to 2.7% of
GDP in 1979. At current prices, recurrent expenditure increased from D14.3M
(US$27.2M) in 1971 to D58.9M (US$147.3M) in 1979, i.e., at an average rate
of 19% per annum. Over the past five years, this corresponds to an annual
average increase of 14% in real terms. However, the proportion of the recurrent
budget devoted to health fell from 9.3% in 1971 to 7.8% in 1980. The distribu-
tion of yearly allocations among the various health institutions has remained
practically unchanged since 1973. General hospitals and institutes continue
to receive the largest share - about 60% of total recurrent expenditure,
whereas 28% is earmarked for regional hospitals and 9% for district hospitals.
In contrast, only 0.5% was left to run the 600 urban and rural dispensaries,
excluding salaries accounted for in hospital budgets (see Annex 4A). As a
whole, the wages and salaries of health personnel represent more than 75% of
total recurrent expenditure (Annex 4C).
1.22      An analysis of the recurrent expenditures of the MOPH in 1979
showed that low-income groups eligible for free medical care received 48%
of total expenditure, while 40% was spent on workers and their families
affiliated with the social security system. The analysis also showed that



- 9 -
about two-thirds was spent on hospital care, while outpatient services in
hospitals absorbed 14% of the recurrent budget, dispensaries 16% and MCH
centers 5%.
1.23      Capital expenditure in the health sector has increased consider-
ably in recent years and amounted to D12.7M (US$31.&I) in 1978 and D16.9M
(US$42.3M) in 1979 (See Annex 4B). This latter figure includes DO.6M (US$1.5M)
for health campaigns and grants to the ONPFP (D2.3M or US$5.8M) and the Bal-
neology Office (DO.5M or US$1.3 M). Direct investment in infrastructure
rose from D9.1M (US$22.8M) in 1978 to D13.4M (US$33.5M) in 1979. Of this
amount, ongoing projects absorbed D12.4M (US$31.OM), and new projects DO.9M
(US$2.3M).
1.24      The ONPFP finances its own activities through separate "operating"
and "investment" budgets.  For 1979 the total operating resources of the ONPFP
amounted to D2M (US$5M), while the investment budget was D2.3M (US$5.8M).
1.25      More than two-thirds of ONPFP's recurrent expenditure are financed
by external donors; the larger contributor is USAID (32%), followed by UNFPA
(25%); other bilateral or multilateral donors include WHO, the International
Program for Voluntary Sterilization, and the International Statistics Insti-
tute (World Fertility Survey). USAID and UNFPA provided in 1979 more than
US$473,000 of contraceptives, US$40,000 of drugs and US$132,000 of equipment.
The 1979 investment budget of US$5.8M was entirely financed by the Government
and was earmarked for the IDA-assisted population project.
External Assistance
1.26      Besides the Bank Group, a number of bilateral and multilateral
agencies have provided support for health, population and nutrition activities
in Tunisia since the mid-1960s. Prominent among them have been USAID, UNFPA,
WFP, SIDA and NORAD. WHO, French, Belgian, Canadian, Bulgarian, Dutch and
Chinese agencies have provided technical assistance. USAID has taken the
lead in providing external support for the development of Tunisia's rural
health service network. Since 1965 USAID, with a total contribution of US$26
million, has been the principal external donor to Tunisia's family planning
and nutrition programs. IDA and NORAD have each provided US$4.8 million.
IDA Population Project
1.27      The only previous Bank Group operation in the health sector in
Tunisia was a population project for which an IDA credit of $4.8
million was approved in April 1971. The project was designed to strengthen
the Tunisian family planning program by increasing the number of contraceptive
acceptors, and to improve mother and child health care. It provided for: (i)
the construction and equipment of four maternity hospitals (Tunis, Sousse,
Sfax, Bizerte); 29 MCH centers, and an extension of the Avicenne Paramedical
Training School in Tunis and its post-graduate training section; and (ii) the
provision of management consultants and technical assistance for paramedical
training and the assessment of the maternal and child health program and the



- 10 -
TFPP. The project was at first administered by the MOPH, and later, from
1974, by the ONPFP, and was scheduled for completion by the end of 1975.
Due to initial delays in selecting consultant architects and completing
designs, construction did not begin until 1974, and progress was much slower
than expected. This was partly due to administrative weaknesses in the ONPFP
and to the fact that Tunisia's construction industry was overtaxed by the
heavy construction programs called for by the Fourth and Fifth Five-Year
Plans. The project is now expected to be completed by the end of 1981. As a
result of the delays in implementation and of price escalation, the total
estimated cost increased to about US$35 million, compared with the initial
appraisal cost of US$7 million. Additional financing has been provided by
NORAD (a US$4.8 million grant in August 1976) and the Government. So far,
76 percent of the combined IDA credit and NORAD grant has been disbursed.
1.28      The 1975 Bank sector review ("The Population Program of the Govern-
ment of Tunisia", Report No. 651-TUN), IDA review missions, and other donors
(mainly USAID and UNFPA) were instrumental in drawing attention to, and
securing a reform of the ONPFP's administrative deficiencies. The Bank review
noted that under the leadership of the ONPFP the delivery of family planning
services had been increased and reorganized; more effective motivation and
education campaigns had been conducted; research had been initiated; new
contraceptive methods introduced; and the collection of family planning data
and training of health workers in family planning methods had been intensi-
fied. The review recommended that family planning services should be further
increased, and that they should be provided by MOPH field staff under ONPFP
supervision. However, the MOPH at that time lacked the continuity, commit-
ment, infrastructure and management skills to take up additional operational
responsibilities for family planning delivery. Consequently, the ONPFP
filled the vacuum by expanding its own parallel delivery system despite the
inefficiencies resulting from duplication of facilities, high unit costs and
inability to cover rural areas adequately. Over the next three years, the
Government moved toward the integration of health and family planning services
and began to test a new delivery system through pilot project in Le Kef, Sfax,
Jendouba and Medjez-el-Bab. Pending the outcome of those efforts, the Govern-
ment permitted ONPFP to retain its established delivery system, as applicable
to the Bank-aided project and elsewhere, as a practical way to maintain
momentum in the family planning program.
1.29      The project's impact on infant mortality and child health cannot yet
be determined, since the MCH centers have only recently come into operation.
The urban centers show promising results, but those in rural areas are still
understaffed, and have a low utilization rate; all centers will be integrated
in the peripheral network of MOPH facilities. Three maternity hospitals
have been constructed and the fourth is expected to be completed before the
end of 1981. The extension of the Avicenne Paramedical Training School has
enabled the Government to train specialized nurses and midwives. The IDA
project reflected the general view prevalent ten years ago that vertical
programs and hospital and clinic based post-partum programs were the most
effective method of recruiting new acceptors. Experience in Tunisia as well
as in other countries has shown that this approach is costly and reaches only
a small proportion of the rural population. It has also shown that, to
attract a larger proportion of the rural population and to generate demand for



- 11 -
family planning, other health services have to be offered in conjunction with
maternal and child care and family planning. On the other hand, experience
has shown that more attention should be given during project preparation to:
(a) the preparation of detailed and realistic project implementation schedules;
(b) the type, size and design of facilities to be provided, and their finan-
cial, manpower and training implications; and (c) the relationship between
project components and the existing health delivery system. This has been
taken into account in the preparation of this proposed project, which is
designed to provide health services as close as possible to where people live,
using simple and economic health facilities and paying special attention to
problems of management and training. The proposed project will benefit from
other Bank projects in the same area. The Rural Roads Project (Loan No.
1601-TUN of 1978) and a similar project in course of preparation will extend
the rural roads network, while the Third Power (Rural Electrification) and the
North West Integrated Rural Development projects will meet pressing needs in
the same underdeveloped area.
II. INTEGRATION OF HEALTH, POPULATION AND
NUTRITION POLICIES AND SERVICES
A. Development Planning and Objectives
2.01      The reduction of social inequalities has been a goal of the Tunisian
Government since independence. During 1970-78 Tunisia spent about 16% of GDP
on various social programs, of which public health took the second largest
share. In the mid-1970's the Government became aware of the need for a
radical shift in the emphasis of the public health system, and this awareness
was reflected in the Fifth Development Plan (1977-81). In the health sector,
the Plan gave priority to basic health care and preventive medicine, improved
cost effectiveness, and better regional distribution of facilities and
personnel. So far, progress in these directions has been confined to
regions where pilot schemes have been carried out.
2.02      The Government's health policy, as expressed in preliminary reports
for the Sixth Five-Year Health Plan (1982-86), is to increase life expectancy
and improve health by making basic health services available in all parts of
the country. To this end, the Government is committed to a better balance
between preventive and curative care and to an extension of health services to
underserved and unserved rural and suburban areas. Among the particular
targets is a reduction in infant mortality from 123/1000 to 50/1000.
2.03      The Government has established demographic objectives designed to
keep the population in line with the country s economic development (Annex
1.E). To attain these objectives, the Government will have to expand its
family planning services, particularly in the rural areas, which are not
effectively reached at present. The proposed program, which would be sup-
ported by this project, would take services through the health system to
underserved rural and urban areas, while continuing the specialized ONPFP
clinics in the major cities.



- 12 -
2.04      The national family planning program aims at reducing the net
reproduction rate from 2.2 in 1980 to 1.15 by the year 2001. Chus, the
general fertility rate (15-49), which was estimated at 155/1000 in 1976, would
need to fall to 135 in 1981, and to 120/1000 by 1986. This reduction would
bring the crude birth rate down to 30/1000 in 1986 (from an est:imated 35.3/
1000 in 1976).
2.05      It will not be easy to reduce the general fertility irate because:
(a) the proportion of women in the 25-29 age group, the most fertile group,
which contained 14% of the total number of women of childbearing age in 1976,
will rise to 16.5% in 1981, and 17.6% in 1986; and (b) in 1977, rural women
constituted 53% of all women in the country, but only 12% of a:l new acceptors.
Improved motivational and service efforts are directed at these problems. To
reach the goal of fertility reduction given in para 2.04 above,, about 410,000
births would have to be averted between 1980 and 1986. This would appear to
be feasible considering that in 1979 the corresponding number was 63,000 (see
Annexes 1E and 1G).
2.06      In order to reduce disparities in nutrition between regions and
groups, the Government intends to: (a) improve the nutrition monitoring
system; (b) intensify its nutritional education program; (c) itiprove nutrition
in rural areas by providing nutrition services through the basi.c health care
delivery system; and (d) step up programs to correct specific nutritional
deficiencies of the lower-income groups. The Government is also carrying out
a feasibility study for a food stamp program.
2.07      The proposed project would address major problems which the Sixth
Plan seeks to correct: (a) strengthen MOPH's capacity for policy formulation,
planning, management, and evaluation; (b) complete the decentralization of
management to the operational level begun in 1977; (c) integrat:e the delivery
of health, family planning and nutrition services, with emphasis on prevention
rather than cure; (d) train new categories of public health workers to serve
in teams at the basic health care level; (e) strengthen the public health
component of medical school training and revise the curricula cf paramedical
schools to meet the needs of the integrated system; and (f) expand infrastruc-
ture in under and unserved areas.
2.08      In order to remedy the present deficiencies in the collection
and analysis of health statistics, the MOPH is setting up a management
information system (MIS) to: (a) provide information on inputs (finance,
personnel and other resources); (b) evaluate the efficiency of the system by
relating inputs to activities; (c) relate activities to changes in the health
of the population; (d) evaluate the effectiveness of the system by measuring
the proportion of the population reached; and (e) improve the cost-effective-
ness of service delivery.
B. Integration of Services
2.09      The decentralization and integration of health services got underway
in 1977 through a Presidential Decree and subsequent Circulars issued by the



- 13 -
Minister of Health, which delegated increasing authority to the six medical
regions (Tunis, Tunis-Sud, Sfax, Sousse, Gafsa, and Jendouba). The Decree
and Circulars call for the integrated regional delivery of curative and
preventive medicine, family planning and nutrition activities, and for the
ONPFP and the INNTA to divest themselves of their field activities, and to
concentrate on research, policy formulation, and the training of specialists
in their own fields. The MOPH is now in the process of separating the
management, administration, and the budget of hospital-based medicine from
those of the peripheral basic health services. At the governorate level,
Regional Directors of Health (RDHs), a new stratum of managers, will coordinate
and control all health activities, including budgeting matters; specially
appointed physicians (Chefs des Services de Sante de Base) will be reponsible
for integrating all basic health services under the functional supervision of
the Director of Basic Health Services (DBHS).
2.10      In order to attract recruits to the government health service, the
Government is improving career prospects (in terms of salaries and promotion),
living and working conditions. The Government is revising the training
programs for physicians and paramedicals. Physicians will be offered courses
in epidemiology and internships in the public health service, while courses in
such subjects as health economics, management, planning and techniques of com-
munication have already been introduced into medical schools. The training of
paramedical workers will lay more emphasis on preventive medicine, health
education, hygiene, nutrition, family planning, and techniques of communica-
tion. More attention will be given to training in managerial skills.
2.11      The MOPH is already strengthening the peripheral health network in
rural and suburban areas. Other aspects of health to which the MOPH also
plans to give additional emphasis through integrated services are:
(a) the control of communicable diseases by means of wider
immunization campaigns and earlier diagnosis;
(b) the control of endemic diseases such as tuberculosis by means
of earlier diagnosis and treatment;
(c) the provision of family planning services;
(d) the early identification of malnutrition and the increased
distribution of dietary supplements such as high protein
flour, vitamins and iron; and
(e) the health of mothers and children, with particular emphasis
on pre- and post-natal care, family planning and the systematic
treatment of gastro-intestinal and respiratory ailments, and
malnutrition, i.e., the chief causes of infant mortality;
(f) the strengthening of health education in the fields of sanita-
tion, family planning and nutrition and its coordination among
the agencies concerned; and
(g) the systematic control of water quality and treatment of wells
with chlorine.



- 14 -
2.12      The MOPH has prepared a detailed plan for the extens.Lon of this
integrated approach to medicine which is intended to bring health services
closer to the population by increasing the density of the healt:h network at
its lower levels and providing a more effective and uniform system of referral
to higher levels. The system functions at four different levels:
(a) At the first level, basic services, such as vaccinati.on, the distri-
bution of simple medicines and contraceptives, the detection oi infectious
diseases and malnutrition and the treatment of minor ailments, are provided on
one day every week or every two weeks in "meeting places" (which may be in
public buildings such as chools, shops or private houses) selected by local
inhabitants, by nurses who travel from one meeting place to another. The
catchment area of each meeting place varies from 300-800 people. People whose
needs cannot be met at these meeting places are referred to the dispensaries
at the second level. In areas more than one hour's walking distance from
dispensaries, a somewhat wider range of services, including in-jections, the
distribution of contraceptives, and family planning advice, is provided by
the same visiting nurses in health posts serving localities wit:h 1,500-3,000
people.
(b) At the second level, a family-wide range of outpatient services is
provided in dispensaries, each serving a population from 5,000--0,000 people
in rural areas or from 10,000 to 20,000 in urban areas, by teamis consisting
of two full-time nurses and visiting physicians, midwives and specialists.
Each rural dispensary will serve all people within a 6-km radius. The services
include medical consultations, family planning advice, insertion of IUDs, the
distribution of medicines, contraceptives and food and vitamin supplements,
and nutritional education;
(c) The third level is based on district hospitals, each serving a
population of about 30,000 people. At these hospitals larger t:eams provide,
in addition to the services available at lower levels, hospitalization (includ-
ing maternity wards), minor surgery (including tubal ligation and medical
abortion), Xray diagnosis and dental treatment. Hygiene technicians are
attached to district hospitals; they survey sanitation in public places, the
quality of water supply and public waste disposal. They also treat rural
wells with chlorine. Schools in the district are regularly visited by medical
teams who provide systematic immunization and control, and advise teachers on
health education;
(d) The fourth level consists of the regional hospitals located in the
larger towns, each serving a population of about 200,000 people, and offering
a comprehensive range of services. Patients whose needs cannol: be met at
lower levels may be referred to these regional hospitals.
A summary of staffing and services envisaged at the first three of these
levels is shown in Annex 6A.



- 15 -
2.13      This approach is based on several pilot schemes 1/ carried out
in the 70s which were designed to bring about significant improvements in the
coverage and quality of medical care. The most important of these projects--
sponsored by USAID and implemented by WHO--was carried out in the Medjez-el-
Bab district, covering a population of 76,000. The Medjez-el-Bab project,
which was at first administered by the ONPFP, working mainly with expatriate
staff, was not successful until the MOPH took over full responsibility
for the project and replaced the expatriates with Tunisian doctors better able
to communicate with the local people. The project has produced encouraging
results since 1976: infant and maternal mortality have been reduced by about
50%; infant malnutrition has fallen by 50%; the proportion of family planning
acceptors is about 25% higher than in neighboring rural districts; access to
safe water has been significantly improved, and the main communicable diseases
have been brought under more effective control. The project extended the
proportion of the population covered by health services from 50% to over 80%,
and also resulted in a significant increase in health facility utilization
rates: from 30% to 70% in the district hospital and maternity clinics, and
from about 40% to 100% in local dispensaries. With the encouragement of the
Director for Preventive Medicine of the MOPH and a group of young physicians
from the Tunis Medical School, and in response to popular demand, the MOPH
early in 1980 started to extend the Medjez-el-Bab project to neighboring
areas. The health team approach, upon which the system depends, was success-
ful in attracting Tunisian physicians and paramedicals to work in rural
areas, served previously mainly by expatriates.
C. MOPH Service Delivery System, Organization and Management
2.14      Under the integrated approach, health, family planning and nutrition
services are delivered principally by the MOPH with support from the ONPFP
and the INNTA.
2.15      For MOPH service delivery, the country is presently divided into six
medical regions. A decree reorganizing the MOPH and strengthening decentral-
ized authority has been submitted for signature to the Prime Minister. It
will establish a Regional Director of Health (RDH) in each governorate. The
RDH, vested with full authority on technical administrative and budget matters,
will report to the Minister, through the Director of Basic Health Services
(DBHS), a post also created within the General Directorate of Public Health
(see Annex 12). Under each RDH, a physician ("Chef des Services de sante de
base") will be directly responsible for integrating basic health services.
1/   "Projet de sante familiale dans la region de Gafsa"; "Projet de sante
familiale dans le gouvernorat de Le Kef"; "Renforcement et integration
des services de sante du Cap Bon"; "Programme de medecine communautaire
dans la region du Sahel"; "Experience de planning familial a domicile
dans le gouvernorat de Sfax"; "Experience-pilote d'integration du planning
familial a la sante familiale en milieu rural dans le gouvernorat de
Jendouba."



- 16 -
2.16      In 1979 Tunisia's public health system provided services through
824 basic health care facilities (126 health posts, 503 rural dispensaries, 85
urban dispensaries, 110 mother and child health care centers), and 49 district
hospitals, 20 regional hospitals, and 18 specialized institutions and general
hospitals (Annex 3C). In addition, the National Social Security Fund is
building six poly clinics, including three in Tunis. The ONFFP provided
family planning services in the 110 MOPH maternal and child care centers, 8 of
which included maternity wards, and 316 MOPH dispensaries. The ONPFP also
managed 15 regional education and family planning centers for counseling and
other services, including sterilization. It also operated 45 mobile regional
teams.
Health Personnel
2.17      The physician to population ratio has improved greatly in recent
years from 1/4800 in 1978 to 1/3650 in 1980 (see Annex 3B). By mid-1980,
Tunisia had about 1,730 doctors. Most are in the larger towns, including 760
in Tunis. The public health services employ about 1,330 doctors, including
450 expatriates serving mainly in rural areas. The number of doctors available
for government service is expected to increase significantly in the next few
years, for three reasons: (a) the very rapid increase in the number of
medical graduates; (b) the leveling-off of emigration of Tunisian physicians
to Arab oil producing countries; and (c) the limited growth of demand from
middle- and higher-income groups in Tunisia for the relatively costly services
of private physicians.
2.18      The number of paramedical personnel has increased regularly, from
about 6,400 in 1972 to 10,400 at present. This figure includes 210 high-level
technicians, 550 midwives, 1,230 specialized nurses and 4,080 nurses (see
Annex 3E). Almost two-thirds of these personnel have been trained for, and
serve in, hospitals.
Educational and Training Programs
2.19      The country has three Faculties of Medicine, in the Universities of
Tunis, Sousse and Sfax, with a total enrollment of more than 3,000 students.
Medical education takes seven years: five years of studies followed by two
years of internship. The number of graduates has tripled in the last five
years to about 340 in 1980. Some 500 graduates are expected in 1981, but the
MOPH hopes to reduce future enrollments to reflect its forecast of manpower
needs and avoid the costs associated with educating an excess number of
physicians. This would also help to reduce pressures to expand costly,
specialized, hospital-based services.
2.20      The training of paramedical personnel takes place in 14 regional
schools as well as in facilities for high-level technicians in the Universities
of Tunis and Sousse, opened in 1976. A large paramedical school (300 student
capacity) is under construction in Monastir. The different types and levels
of training provided are as follows:
(a) auxiliary health workers: one-year training after the fourth
grade of secondary education;



- 17 -
(b) nurses: two-year training after the fifth grade of secondary
education;
(c) specialized nurses: three-year training after the seventh grade
of secondary education; specializations include surgery, intensive
care, general care, pediatrics, psychiatry, public health,
laboratory assistance, pharmacy assistance and medical secretarial
(two-year training); and
(d) higher-level technicians: three-year training after the bacca-
laureate; specializations include nutrition, physiotherapy,
radiology, radiotherapy, obstetrics, anesthesiology, biology,
cytology, hygiene and environment, and dentistry.
2.21      Teachers in the paramedical schools are either doctors, pharmacists
or administrators teaching part-time, or full-time trainers. The latter are
experienced specialized nurses or high-level technicians who have undergone a
nine-month training course in the Center for Pedagogical Research and Training
(CRFP) attached to the Faculty of Medicine of Tunis. The CRFP is also respon-
sible for the design and revision of paramedical school curricula. The
teaching staff of the 14 paramedical schools consists of 139 full-time
trainers and 404 part-time teachers.
2.22      The paramedical training system has now more than 3,700 students:
2,300 in the regional schools and 1,400 in the two university sections. The
output of the training system is shown in Annex 3G; in 1980 it comprised 250
auxiliary health workers, more than 500 nurses, 200 specialized nurses and
450 high-level technicians, including 100 midwives.
2.23      The projected output of the training system will be sufficient to
cover manpower requirements arising from current hospital construction as well
as the continuing expansion of the health system. However, a number of
deficiencies, most of which have already been identified by MOPH, need to be
addressed. They mainly stem from rapid, inadequately planned expansion in
response to the high attrition rate due to the migration of qualified nurses
to Europe and Arab countries, now slowing down, combined with increasing
demand for education. Because employment opportunities can hardly keep pace
with the growth of the labor force, and the expansion of the education system,
candidates tend to have more education than the posts available to them
require. As a result, health workers tend to be both over-educated and
over-trained, a situation that breeds frustration and, in some cases, even
affects the quality of services, since workers may consider the performance of
certain tasks as incompatible with their self-perceived professional status.
A good illustration is furnished by midwives, who now receive a university
training qualifying them as high-level technicians in obstetrics and, in
consequence, consider themselves entitled to hospital appointments rather
than work in villages.
2.24      A further difficulty is that responsibilities of most of these
categories of personnel have not been clearly defined, and the corresponding
job descriptions are not always explicit. Curricula are strongly biased
towards hospital and curative care, and do not give adequate attention



- 18 -
to hygiene, family health, family planning and nutrition. Moreover, the
failure to distinguish clearly between job categories sometiries leads to
duplication of training. The need for a reduction in the nuriber of special-
izations, in favor of a more general, multipurpose type of training, and also
for the harmonization of overlapping curricula has now been recognized, and
will be reflected in the revised curricula prepared by the CaFP. The first
year revision is already completed and the curricula for the second and third
years will be undertaken under the project.
2.25      Teaching methods do not call for enough active participation from
trainees and put too much emphasis on theoretical knowledge, at the expense of
practical training, teamwork and communication techniques. Trainers themselves
often lack pedagogical experience and there is excessive reliance on part-time
trainers (doctors, pharmacists, technicians, administrators), a situation
which will be difficult to remedy in the short run. Finally, there is a
general lack of adequate budgetary provision for equipment and teaching
materials, especially in the smaller regional paramedical schools. Moreover,
some buildings are inadequate and poorly maintained.
Drugs and Medication
2.26      Through a central pharmacy, the Government controls; the import,
production, distribution and pricing of all medications, pharmaceutical
products, medical equipment and supplies for both human and veterinary use.
The central pharmacy produces about 55% of the value of all drugs prescribed
in hospitals, and about 12% of the value of those distributed through retail
pharmacies. Of about 270 retail pharmacies, about 80 are ope!rated by the
Central Pharmacy, and 190 by private enterprise. The Central. Pharmacy sells a
wide variety of generic and name-brand drugs to retailers at prices much
higher than cost; this serves to subsidize the cost of drugs made available
through Government services.
2.27      While hospitals and urban dispensaries generally receive adequate
supplies of drugs, rural dispensaries experience periodic shortages, reflecting
the hospital bias of the health system. This results from the existing
budgeting system which does not disaggregate the resource allocations between
hospitals and dispensaries. As of 1982, a revised budgeting system is being
introduced in order to identify specific resources for basic health care, thus
ensuring adequate provision of medical supplies at all levels.
Need for the Project
2.28      Despite substantial progress, several important problems continue
to affect the quality and coverage of Tunisian health, family planning and
nutrition programs. Growth of urban services has far outstripped expansion
in rural areas. A large unmet demand for family planning services persists,
in rural areas, partly because of 15 years of success in information and
education activities. Nutrition outreach is extremely limited, although
nutrition education appears to have met with some success. At the same time,
only about half the rural population has access to adequate health care.
Health services retain a bias towards curative methods and expensive hospital
care. Management, training and logistical deficiencies, acccimpanied by only
slow progress towards integration and decentralization, have perpetuated
inappropriate and costly patterns of health, family planning and nutrition
services.



- 19 -
2.29      The Government's new health policies and programs seek to remedy
those deficiencies. The 1982-86 Development Plan is expected to propose major
improvements in the main areas of priority concern. First, it would strengthen
MOPH central planning and management capabilities by training personnel and
installing a management information system for health surveillance and to
monitor and evaluate the performance and financial aspects of the system.
2.30      Second, the new approach calls for further integration, redirection
and decentralization of health, family planning and nutrition services.
Expansion and strengthening of the rural health care network would correct
rural-urban imbalance; a shift toward broadening the delivery of preventive
services would reduce curative bias. The plan also provides for the training
and deployment of para-professional workers and the development of an effective
system to support and supervise them.
2.31      The Government seeks Bank assistance to carry out these improvements
in eight governorates as a step towards national coverage. The project was
prepared over two years of close consultation with both the Government and
donor agencies, including AID, which is already providing support for the
new program in two governorates and is expected to extend it to two more
during the next year.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Concept and Objectives
3.01      The Government is strongly committed to its integrated health
policy, which is clearly supported by rural populations and community leaders.
The project would help the Government to extend basic health care to the
whole population by 1990 by providing better and more cost-effective health
services for the lower income groups and increasing the efficiency of family
planning and nutrition programs in eight selected governorates. Priority
target groups would be infants, pre-school children and women of reproductive
age. The project draws on the experience gained through the pilot projects
carried out in the seventies, particularly in the Medjez-el-Bab area (para.
2.13), which emphasized the health team approach and the need to: (a) gain
better knowledge of the population's health needs by monitoring basic health
indicators (see Annex 7); (b) strengthen preventive care, with particular
attention to mothers and pre-school children; (c) improve health education;
and (d) encourage Tunisian physicians to serve in rural areas.
3.02      The experience derived from the IDA population project is reflected
in the special attention that has been given to: (a) strengthening the
management capability of the MOPH and its equipment and building unit; (b)
simplifying the design of new health facilities and (c) planning how to meet
the financial, staffing and training requirements generated by the project.
The project will also include a monitoring and evaluation system for the
prompt identification of implementation problems to permit timely corrective
intervention.



- 20 -
3.03      In its first phase the national basic health care delivery system
is being introduced in 12 governorates, of which eight will be included
in the proposed project. For the Bank project, the Government has selected
six thinly populated rural governorates with low per capita income (Jendouba,
Le Kef, Beja, Zaghouan, Kairouan, and Mahdia) and two better developed and
more densely populated governorates where trained personnel and training
institutions are more readily available (Sousse and Monastir). A plan for the
expansion of the new health delivery system to the rest of Tunisia would be
prepared as part of the project.
3.04      Based on achievements in Medjez-el-Bab, the specific objectives of
the project in the eight governorates are to reduce: (a) infant mortality
to about 80/1000 from an estimated national average of 123 per thousand con-
sidered as representative for the project area; (b) the birth rate from about
43/1000 to 36/1000; and (c) morbidity from tuberculosis and other respiratory
diseases, parasitic and viral infections. These objectives are to be achieved
over a five-year period, once the project has become fully operational. While
ambitious, they are attainable where project services operate as planned.
These objectives are to be attained by increasing the proportion of the
population having access to basic health services from about 50% to about
90%, by extending health education and by providing the target population
with services designed to:
(a) reduce infant mortality -- by providing systematic pre- and
post-natal care; improving hygiene and nutrition for pregnant
women and pre-school children; providing treatment of diarrhea
by oral rehydration; identifying women at risk and increasing
attended deliveries; ensuring vaccination against polio,
diphtheria, and measles;
(b) reduce morbidity from common diseases -- by providing earlier
diagnosis and treatment; improving sanitation, particularly as
regards quality control and treatment of wells; extending health
education; strengthening epidemic control programs, and making
greater use of diagnostic equipment.
(c) reduce fertility -- by expanding family planning seruvices,
population education, and counselling and making contraceptives
widely accessible in rural areas; and
(d) ensure easy access to and adequate provision of the above
services, where needed -- by providing the necessary outpatient
facilities and equipment.
Annex 5 summarizes these services and their expected impact on the target
population.
3.05      The Government's pattern of integrated basic health services
delivery has been designed to provide 90% coverage in the following areas:
family planning services; infant inoculations; preventive and curative
services for children; general curative services and hygiene anad sanita-
tion services. Staffing requirements and facility designs take full account
of the daily workload represented by the above demand.



- 21 -
3.06      The population in the project area was estimated at 2.3 million in
mid-1980, i.e. about one third of the country's population. It is expected to
grow by 2% per annum, and is projected to reach 2.5 million or about 35% of
the country's total population, by 1986. About 65% of the project area
population can be considered rural, since only two governorates (Sousse and
Monastir) are highly urbanized (Annex 3A). At 90% coverage, beneficiaries
would include about 81,000 infants, 279,000 children between one and five
years of age and 315,000 married women of reproductive age, including 174,000
receiving family planning services.
B. Summary of Project
3.07      The project would:  (a) improve the management capacity of the
MOPH; (b) strengthen and extend the basic health care delivery system;
(c) increase the scope and effectiveness of communication programs in health,
population and nutrition; (d) upgrade the training system and infrastructure,
and train and redeploy project personnel for the integrated delivery system;
and (e) provide technical assistance to the MOPH in the fields of health
planning, management information systems and curriculum development.
3.08      The project would provide for:
(a)  Management improvement:
(i) Equipment and material for the MIS and project administra-
tion, including 4 sedans;
(ii) Computer services for new programs, data processing, moni-
toring and evaluation;
(iii) Five man-years of technical assistance in health planning
and MIS, and six scholarships (36 man-months) for training
abroad in these fields;
(iv) Local consultant services for the preparation of a plan to
extend the integrated health system to the rest of the
country, and the implementation of the applied research
program;
(v) Internal travel expenditure for project management staff.
(b) Strengthening of Basic Health Care Services:
(i) The construction and equipment of 76 health-posts; 82
rural dispensaries; 11 urban dispensaries; 88 staff
houses; and 8 vehicle maintenance workshops;



- 22 -
(ii)  The remodeling or expansion of, and the provision of
additional equipment for 62 health posts, 201 rural
dispensaries and 25 urban dispendaries;
(iii) Additional equipment for the 21 district hospitals in
the project area;
(iv)  Vehicles:  38 small sedans, 29 four-wheel drive,
19 ambulances and 100 mopeds;
(c) Health, Population and Nutrition Communications:
(i) The construction and equipment of two regional health
education centers, and the remodeling and additional
equipment for the central health education center in
Tunis;
(ii) Equipment, vehicles and material for the retraining
programs and health education campaigns;
(d) Training:
(i) The remodeling of and provision of additional equipment
for six paramedical schools;
(ii)  Vehicles:  4 small sedans and 6 mini-buses;
(iii) External technical assistance in curriculum development
(2 man-years), short-term scholarships for training abroad
of 8 health educators, and local consultant services for
the preparation of training programs and seminars;
(iv) Internal travel expenditure for the implementation of
training programs.
C. Detailed Project Description
3.09      The project would help the Government develop its integrated health
delivery system (see para. 2.12) by strengthening MOPH planning and manage-
ment, and extending the decentralization process begun in 1977. A program of
construction and remodeling would expand peripheral health facilities.
Health education would be extended. The integration of preventive, curative,
family planning, nutrition and sanitation services calls for appropriate
retraining of health workers, and a revision of the curriculum of paramedical
schools. Both would be carried out under the project. Finally, a program of
studies and applied research would be carried out with a view to improving
the efficiency of the integrated health delivery system and preparing for its
gradual extension to the rest of the country.



- 23 -
Management Improvement
3.10      Management System:  Effective rationalization and decentralization
of the integrated health delivery system requires the Government to complete
the process of setting-up suitable arrangements for management, administration
and budgeting of basic health care. The MOPH is appointing a new category
of managers (Regional Directors of Health, or RDH) to take charge at the
governorate level, vested with adequate powers to exercise technical, adminis-
trative and budget control over basic health care. The RDHs will report to
the Minister through the Director of Basic Health Services (DBHS). To assist
the DBHS in planning and programming, the project would provide the services
of one health planner manager (three man-years). The project would also
provide training for the RDHs and other middle-level managers (see para.
3.31). Before negotiations, the Government designated the DBHS. The eight
physicians in charge of BHC in the project governorates were also appointed.
The appointment of the DBHS will be a condition of efectiveness.
3.11      The project would strengthen the MOPH's Management Information
System (MIS) to permit better planning and control of resources. The basic
features of the improved MIS will be: (a) standardized collection forms
covering a limited number of basic health indicators (Annex 7); (b) systematic
data collection by MOPH personnel; (c) the expansion of statistical and
supporting staff and (d) computerized data handling (including new programs)
using the central computer of the National Computer Center and decentralized
regional terminals. The project would provide the services of one management
information expert (two man-years) to assist in setting up the MIS. The
project would also provide twelve computer terminals, calculators and other
equipment and material.
3.12      The MIS provides the tools for:  (a) identifying problems promptly;
(b) sound health planning; (c) better budgeting and more efficient cost-
control of health services; (d) continuous monitoring and evaluation of
inputs, service delivery, and outputs; and (e) maintaining an updated health,
nutrition and demographic profile of the population.
3.13      Studies and Applied Research:  The project would include research
to identify through experience improved ways of meeting health needs in rural
areas and the cost and relative impact of essential services. The project
would finance about 100 man/months of consultants services, preferably local,
to carry out applied research into these questions. The research program
would be designed by the DBHS and the CRFP. During negotiations, the main
topics to be included in the applied research program were reviewed and
agreed and assurances obtained that the consultants qualifications, expe-
rience and terms and conditions of employment will be satisfactory to the
Bank.
3.14      Research topics already identified include:
(a) costs: the costs of preventive and curative services at the
periphery;



- 24 -
(b) behavioral patterns: the results of the National Fertility
Survey, which will be available shortly, will identify
important new areas for family planning research, particularly
into supply-demand relationships; the attitude of rural popu-
lations towards the health system; incentives and disincentives
for health personnel to work in rural areas; and the relative
effectiveness of various channels of health education, such as
the mass media;
(c)  management:  communication within the MOPH; inter-agency
coordination and cooperation at central and local levels;
basic indicators for local health planning and drug distribu-
tion at the periphery; and
(d) impact: comparison between the impact of population, health
and nutrition services in a project governorate and in one
outside the project.
3.15      Project-financed local consultants would also help the DBHS to
prepare a detailed plan for the extension of the integrated health delivery
system to the whole country. The plan will take into account the experience
gained during the first three years of the proposed Bank and U5AID projects.
Strengthening of Basic Health Care Services
3.16      This component would set up basic health care (BHC) services to
reach 90% of the project population with integrated health, nuLrition and
family planning services. These services would be provided by health teams
operating through an expanded and upgraded network of posts and dispensaries
as described in para 2.12, and would include MCH care, endemic disease
control, nutrition and family planning. The teams would also provide health
education as described in para. 3.24. Annex 6B provides a tabLe of these
services.
3.17      The integrated delivery system will extend family planning services
to under-served rural areas where logistical problems and the absence of
links with the health services have limited the effectiveness of the ONPFP.
It will aim at increasing the prevalence rate among family plalning acceptors
in the project area from an average of 17% to at least 25%, which represent
an additional 25,000 new continuing users by the last year of 1:he project.
It will not affect urban areas where MCH centers have proved successful and
will continue to operate.  The new system will promote better nutrition
education, micronutrient distribution, and the supplementary feeding of
malnourished pre-school children and pregnant and nursing women. It will
also improve sanitation through the systematic chlorination and maintenance
of wells, and the training of local populations in waste disposal, personal
and environmental hygiene.
3.18      Service Delivery:  Health, family planning and nutrition services
will be delivered by teams of public health nurses, general physicians and



- 25 -
midwives, who will be assisted by nutritionists, nurse-supervisors, health
educators and sanitary technicians. In rural areas, each team will serve an
average of ten dispensaries on a regular schedule (see Annex 6A). The teams
will supervise resident nurses and monitor the performance of activities at
each dispensary, including the systematic referral of patients. The project
would include incremental operating costs. The system will also provide an
adequate supply of drugs and contraceptives at the peripheral level.
3.19      Infrastructure:  The project would reinforce the health infrastruc-
ture in the eight governorates. Health posts and dispensaries would be
improved or remodeled where appropriate, and provided with additional equip-
ment. Modest staff housing would be attached to existing or new rural dispen-
saries where necessary. Additional laboratory and medical equipment would be
allocated to the district hospitals. The project would finance the construc-
tion and equipment of additional health rooms (76), rural dispensaries (82),
urban dispensaries (9) and staff houses (88). The MOPH building unit carried
out a mapping exercise to determine their location on the basis of population
densities and existing service facilities. Some of the new facilities would
replace inadequate, rented or irreparable existing facilities.
3.20      The settlements at Jebel-Lahmar and Saida-Manoubia in the Tunis
area are being upgraded under the Second Bank Urban Development Project which,
however, provided only sites for health facilities. Jebel-Lahmar, with an
area of over 80 hectares and a population of about 42,000, has only one dis-
pensary; a clinic is under construction. Although Saida-Manoubia covers over
90 hectares with a population of about 32,000, it has no health facilities.
The project would finance the construction and equipment of an urban dispen-
sary in each settlement on sites prepared under the Second Urban Development
Project (Loan 1705-TUN of 1979).
3.21      The Equipment and Building Unit of the MOPH (EBU) has prepared
standard designs for each type of facility (Annex 10) and would supervise
construction, which would be carried out by the Ministry of Equipment, or in
the case of some rural health posts and dispensaries, by regional authorities
acting on behalf of the MOPH. The selection and acquisition of the sites is
not expected to present difficulties in rural areas, where Government owned
land is readily available. The buildings would be small and simple to construct
from mainly local mayerials.2 The nopms for health posts, rural and urban
dispensaries are 50M , 100 M , 150 M respectively. Changes to be incorporated
in the final architectural designs for health posts and dispensaries were
agreed upon during negotiations, and assurances were obtained that the sites
for the four new urban dispensaries will be acquired before December 31,
1981.
3.22      The project would provide ambulances and other vehicles to transport
patients, staff and materials, as well as for the construction and equipment
of a vehicle maintenance workshop in each of the eight governorates. Final
architectural designs for vehicle maintenance workshops are being revised
along the lines agreed upon during negotiations. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the sites for the eight vehicle maintenance workshops
will be acquired before December 31, 1981.



- 26 -
Health, Population and Nutrition Communications
3.23      The communications component is designed to strengthen and develop
the population, health and nutrition activities of the ONPFP, the MOPH, the
INNTA and the Ministry of Education. A working party set up by the MOPH for
this purpose and, composed of two representatives of each, has already drawn
up a communications development program.
3.24      The main purpose of the communications program would be to help
field workers do a better job of motivating families to adopt improved health,
family planning and nutrition practices. Mass media messages would reinforce
individual and group contact between workers and the project population. The
communications effort would be designed to meet two basic criteria:  (a) the
desired behavioral or attitudinal change would be of major importance to
family or individual well-being and (b) it could be accomplished without a
major change in current economic or social conditions.
3.25      The members of the Communications Working Party wouLd organize
in-service training courses for the field workers of all four agencies. The
Regional Directors of the MOPH will coordinate these courses and will ensure
that they are available to all extension workers, of agencies concerned in
informing the public.
3.26      During the first year of project implementation, a sample survey of
peoples attitudes to health and their reactions to health education would be
carried out in order to indentify the critical areas to be covered by the
communications program.  The survey would be included in the studies and
applied research program.
3.27      The project would finance the production of educational visual aids,
especially printed and illustrated materials for primary schools and mothers,
all of which would be distributed nationally. Motivational f:Llms and slides
for training purposes would be produced.
3.28      The project would provide for the construction of two regional
health education centers, one in Sousse and one in Jendouba, which would be
used by the Working Party as training and retraining centers, for group
meetings of community leaders, pregnant women and school teachers, for demon-
strations to all field workers and other government personnel, as centers for
the production of simple visual aids and for storage and distribution.  The
MOPH Center in Tunis would be expanded to.produce more, effective exhibition
material and additional types of educational-visual aids. Assurances were
also abtained that the two corresponding sites will be acquired before
December 31, 1981.
3.29      Since communication activities-are now gravely hampered by lack of
transport, the project would provide two vehicles to enable the Tunis Health
Education Center to maintain liaison in the regional offices, two vans for the
health education centers in Sousse and Jendouba and four vans for the eight
project governorates. These vehicles would be maintained by t:he regional
workshops.



- 27 -
Training
3.30      This component would finance training for middle-level health man-
agers and statisticians, paramedical personnel and their teachers, health
educators and physicians in the project area. It also would finance curricu-
lum development for training of physicians and paramedical personnel and
equipment, vehicles and the remodeling of six paramedical schools.
3.31      Middle-level Managers and Statisticians.  The project would provide
management training for 40 middle-level managers and statisticians. At the
regional and governorate levels they will need, in addition to the skills they
now possess, improved competence in such managerial functions as health
assessment (data collection, MIS), programming (plan of work, scheduling,
budgets), organization and staffing, direction and supervision, evaluation
and control. These programs would be organized by the MOPH in collaboration
with the Faculties of Medicine and Economics of the University of Tunis. In
addition, the project would provide 6 six months scholarships for studies
abroad.
3.32      Teachers.  There are at present 139 full-time teachers (including
14 expatriates) and more than 400 part-time trainers (see para. 2.21). Start-
ing in July 1981, with staff of paramedical schools in the project area, the
CRFP will undertake the systematic retraining of the 125 full-time Tunisian
teachers, through short-term (four weeks) intensive courses. By the end of
October 1981, all 45 full-time teachers in the project area are expected to
have been retrained.
3.33      Health Educators.  The project would provide eight three-month
scholarships in 1981 for the training abroad of members of the inter-agency
working party set up by MOPH (see para. 3.23) in methods of health education
and communication techniques. Upon their return, they will retrain health
educators of all participating agencies, who in turn will teach paramedical
workers and other field staff how to impact health education.
3.34      Physicians and Paramedicals.  The number of public service physi-
cians serving outside hospitals in the project area will be increased from
60 to 80 (see Annex 60). They will all attend one-week seminars on the new
integrated approach, in groups of six (para. 3.38).
3.35      About 1,020 paramedicals are working outside hospitals in the
project area (50 high-level technicians and specialized nurses, 410 nurses
and 560 auxilliary health workers) (see Table 3F). They man 25 urban dis-
pensaries, 36 MCH centers, 201 rural dispensaries and 61 health posts (see
Table 3C). After completion of the project, the peripheral network will
consist of 65 urban dispensaries and MCH centers, 252 rural dispensaries
and 130 health posts. The application of the new staffing patterns described
in Annex 6A to the extended network will entail the recruitment of 500 more
paramedicals (100 high-level technicians and specialized nurses and 400
nurses), i.e., an average of 100 per year over the project period (see Annex
6C). As mentioned above (see para. 2.23), the annual output of the training



- 28 -
system is sufficient to meet the manpower requirements arising from the
hospital construction program as well as from the extension of peripheral
.services.
3.36      The program would thus provide training for about 1,060 para-
medicals as follows:
(a)  retraining of 700 persons -- 50 high-level technicimns
and specialized nurses, 410 nurses, and 240 auxilla:ry
health workers (it is etimated that some 40% of thor,e
presently in service meet the required education and
experience standards);
(b) additional training for 60 persons to meet replacement
needs (20 per year assuming an attribution rate of 2%);
and
(c) additional training for the 300 new paramedicals who will
enter the system before the graduates trained under the
revised curriculum.
3.37      The retraining program for physicians and paramedicals would focus
on preventive care, outpatient treatment of common ailments, health education
and communication techniques. MCH, nutrition and family planning would
receive special emphasis. Two MOPH teams, already trained by the CRFP, would
conduct the program. Each team would cover four governorates and would have
five members: a physician experienced in primary health care, a family plan-
ning educator, a nurse-teacher, a nursing supervisor, and a part-time nutri-
tionist or public health educator. The retraining courses would be spread
over a three-year period. For paramedicals they would consist; of two weeks of
formal training, followed by 2-3 months of field work, and the!n by an addi-
tional week of training. The CRFP has prepared a detailed timetable for the
retraining program, which would be phased with the construction program and
the opening of the new health facilities. By September 1985 all new para-
medicals entering the public health system are expected to have been trained
under the revised curriculum (see Annex 9B).
3.38      The same teams also would organize one-week seminars for physicians
in charge of basic health services in the governorates. These seminars would
pay particular attention to the special role of each member of the team,
while emphasizing the physician's responsibility as team leader. The program
includes training in communication techniques, administration and monitoring.
The medical faculties, for their part, are organizing remedial training pro-
grams to meet the special needs of individual physicians in gynecology,
pediatrics, nutrition and public health.
3.39      Since paramedicals would be retrained in groups of 15 and physicians
in groups of 6, the training teams would be required to organize, during the
three-year period, a total of 70 three-week courses for paramedicals and 13
one-week seminars for physicians.



- 29 -
3.40      Curriculum Development.  The CRFP already has prepared the revised
curriculum for the first year of paramedical schools which will be introduced
in October 1981. In addition to clinical training, the revised curriculum
will include: practical epidemiology; communication techniques; nutrition;
family planning and child rearing. At the end of the formal training period,
paramedicals will receive at least six months on-the-job experience in public
health. The staff of the CRFP, which includes UNDP-financed expatriates,
has been reinforced by additional Tunisian personnel. The project would
provide the services of a curriculum development specialist (two man-years of
technical assistance) to assit the CRFP in revising the curricula for the
second and third year of paramedical training, and the three-year program for
high-level technicians. The revised curriculum for the first year of para-
medical training was reviewed during negotiations and assurances were obtained
that the revision of curricula for the second and third year of paramedical
schools, and the three-year program for high-level technicians, will be
completed in time to be introduced at the beginning of each academic year,
starting in October 1982.
3.41      The MOPH already has started strengthening the public health
training of physicians. Courses in epidemiology, health economics, manage-
ment, planning and techniques of communication have been added to the curri-
culum, while the number of internships in the public health services has been
increased.
3.42      Infrastructure, Vehicles and Equipment.  The project would provide
funds for remodeling and equipping the regional paramedical schools in
Kairouan, Sousse, Le Kef and Menzel-Bourguiba. It would also provide for the
conversion of hospitals in Mahdia and Jendouba into suitably equipped accommo-
dation to replace two existing paramedical schools, which at present have
inadequate facilities. Two new hospitals are to be opened in place of the
ones which would become paramedical schools. Each school would be provided
with additional teaching materials and a minibus to transport students to
rural health centers for practical courses. The two training teams would be
provided with four small sedans.
Technical Assistance
3.43      The project would provide consultant services for the applied
reserach program, the organization of training and the supervision of civil-
works. The project would also provide three specialists for a total of seven
man-years to train MOPH staff in the latest technology in the fields of
health MIS, health planning, and curriculum development. These consultants
and specialists would be engaged under terms of reference and conditions
acceptable to the Bank. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
Tunisian counterparts will be appointed before the arrival of the three
technical assistance specialists.

IV. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT, DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITS
A. Costs and Financing
4.01      The total cost of the proposed five-year project is estimated at
US$41 million equivalent. Base costs are calculated at US$29.6 million
equivalent and contingencies at US$11.4 million equivalent. Taxes and duties,
estimated at US$2.8 million are included. The foreign exchange component is
estimated at US$12.5 million, 30% of total project costs. Costs of construc-
tion, equipment and vehicles account for US$13.8 million, or 46% of base
costs. Computer services costs are US$1.1 million, 4% of base costs.
Technical assistance, consultant services, scholarships abroad, training and
project management account for US$1.4 million, or 5% of base costs. Incre-
mental salaries arising from project implementation are estimated at US$10.7
million, or 36% of base costs. Finally, drugs, contraceptives and other
supplies amount to US$2.6 million, or 9% of base costs. Tables 1 and 2 below
summarize cost estimates by component and by expenditure category.
4.02      Basis of cost estimates.  The costs of civil works have been esti-
mated on the basis of current contracts for the construction of comparable
facilities. Equipment costs are based on current CIF unit prices duties and
taxes, plus local transportation and installation costs. Vehicle costs are
based on unit prices in Tunisia about half of which consists of duties when
the vehicles are not assembled locally. The costs of computer and consultant
services are based on current contracts for similar services. In line with
local experience, cost estimates of technical assistance are based on an
average of US$6,600 per man month for experts and about US$2,000 per month for
scholarships, including travel costs. Estimates of incremental salaries are
based on current MOPH scales. Incremental training costs are based on current
monthly stipends paid to trainees in paramedical schools. Estimates of other
incremental expenditures (drugs, supplies, maintenance, etc.) are based on
actual MOPH budget allocations.
4.03      Contingency allowance.  The project costs include a contingency
allowance of US$11.4 million for (a) physical contingencies estimated at 10%
for civil works and equipment and 5% for computer services, technical assist-
ance and consultant services and other incremental expenditures; and (b) price
contingencies, estimated at 29% of the base cost plus physical contingencies.
Total contingencies represent 38% of-base cost. Price contingencies for
both foreign and local costs were computed on the basis of increases of (a) 9%
in 1981, 8% in 1982 and 7% per annum thereafter for construction; (b) 10% in
1981, 9% in 1982, 8% in 1983 and 7% per annum thereafter for equipment and
vehicles; and (c) 8% in 1981 and 1982 and 7% per annum thereafter for other
types of expenditure (Annex 12 D).
4.04      Foreign exchange component.  The estimated foreign exchange
component is US$12.5 milion, equivalent to 30% of total project cost.  The
calculation of the foreign exchange component is based on the expectation
that (a) all civil works contracts will be awarded to local firms; (b) all

equipment will be of foreign origin and about 90% will be directly imported;
(c) all vehicle contracts will be awarded to local suppliers; (d) about 70%
of the consultant contracts will be awarded to local firms; and (e) all tech-
nical assistance will be provided fr-om foreign sources. The resulting foreign
exchange components for the various categories of expenditure are as follows:
(i) civil works 26%; (ii) equipment 87%; (iii) vehicles 42%; (iv) computer
services 30%; (v) technical assistance, consultant services and scholarships
80%; (vi) training, project management and incremental salaries 0%; and (vii)
drugs, contraceptives and supplies 55%.
4.05      Financial feasibility.  Recurrent public health expenditures
outside hospitals in the project area (estimated at US$6.5 million in 1980, or
4.4% of the total operating budget of MOPH) represent an average of US$2.81
per capita. After completion of the project, recurrent health expenditures
outside hospitals in the project area would reach US$4.19 per capita (a total
of US$10.5 million). During the past five years, current health expenditure
increased, in real terms, by an average of 14% per annum, and amounted to
more than 8% of the total recurrent budget (see Annex 4C). Bank projec-
tions for 1980-1985 show GDP and total public expenditure, both growing at
6.5% in real terms per annum. Because of the Government's social objectives
and its commitment to the expansion of integrated health services in rural
areas, recurrent health expenditure can also be expected to grow at the same
rate. By 1985, recurrent health expenditure outside hospitals in the project
area would then represent 5.2% of the operating budget of the MOPH (compared
with 4.4% in 1980). Incremental expenditures generated by the project during
its last year would represent less than 2% of MOPH's recurrent budget for that
year. This is considered an attainable objective, in view of the Government's
stated policy of redressing the balance of expenditure between hospital and
peripheral services.
4.06      Financing.  The total cost of the project (US$41 million) is to be
financed by an IBRD loan of US$12.5 million equivalent which is equal to the
estimated foreign exchange cost, and a Government contribution of US$28.5
million equivalent. The loan will be at an annual rate of interest of 9.6%
for a period of 17 years, including a grace period of 4 years. The Govern-
ment's contribution will finance the local costs (Annex 12).
B. Procurement
4.07      Contracts for civil works amounting to US$9.2 million including
physical and price contingencies will, for the most part, be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding following domestic advertising and local proce-
dures which are satisfactory to the Bank. These procedures will permit the
grouping of contracts and the participation of foreign contractors (the
prequalification of contractors would be required by the EBU). It is very
unlikely, however, that foreign or even local firms will be attracted by very
small contracts for health facilities scattered over isolated rural regions
of the country; therefore some of the remodelling work and small isolated



- 33 -
buildings will be executed by regional authorities, through force account,
not to exceed an aggregate total of US$3.9 million including contingencies.
The Bank's prior approval would be required for individual civil works
contracts exceeding US$100,000 equivalent.
4.08      To the extent practicable, contracts for furniture, equipment and
vehicles with an estimated total cost of US$7.4 million, including contin-
gencies, will be grouped in packages of not less than US$50,000 equivalent.
Contracts in excess of US$50,000 will be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines for Procurement.
Contracts of less than US$50,000 equivalent, expected to total about US$0.5
million, will be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally in accordance with local procedures satisfactory to the Bank. The
likely size of bid packages for equipment and vehicles is projected to be
about US$300,000. For bid evaluation purposes, a 15 percent margin of
preference, or the actual customs duties, whichever is lower, would be
allowed for equipment,  furniture, vehicles and materials manufactured in
Tunisia.
4.09      The coordinating unit (see para. 5.01) will be responsible for
scheduling all project procurement. Under the supervision of the Secretary
General of the MOPH, the Equipment and Building Unit (EBU) will conduct the
procurement of the construction, equipment and vehicles. The EBU has the
appropriate expertise and will coordinate the procurement with the Ministry
of Equipment and regional authorities as required.
C. Disbursement
4.10      The loan would be disbursed to meet:
(a) 40% of the cost of civil works;
(b) 100% of the foreign cost of directly imported equipment,
furniture, vehicles and materials or 50% if purchased
locally ("off-the-shelf"), and 100% of the ex-factory
price of locally manufactured equipment and vehicles;
(c) 100% of the cost of technical assistance and scholarships,
training and incremental costs of internal travel of project
management staff; and
(d) 60% of computer services.
4.11      Disbursements will be made on the basis of full documentation,
except for: (i) civil works on force account, and (ii) expenditure for local
training and project management, which would be made against certificates of
expenditure, the documentation for which would not be submitted to the Bank,
but retained by the Government for audit and for inspection by project review
missions. No disbursements would be made against drugs, contraceptives and
other supplies. A schedule of disbursement of the Bank loan is presented in
Annex 12 E.



- 34 -
D. Audit
4.12      The accounting department of the MOPH, whose procedures are adequate,
will keep separete accounts for the purposes of the project. Project accounts
(including certificates of expenditure) will be regularly audited by the
Directorate for Financial Control of the Ministry Planning and Finance whose
procedures are satisfactory to the Bank. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that project accounts will be audited annually and that certified
copies of these accounts, together with audit reports will be forwarded to the
Bank not later than six months after the end of the Government fiscal year.
Assurances were also obtained that certificates of expenditure would be
audited internally at least once every six months, and that the relevant
certificates and audit reports will be retained by the MOPH Ior examination by
Bank review missions. These reports would show, inter alia, that the funds
withdrawn were used for the purposes intended, the goods had been received,
work performed and that payments had been made.
V. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Coordination
5.01      The MOPH will set up a special unit attached to the Ministerial
Cabinet to coordinate the project. The unit will report directly to a senior
staff of the Cabinet of the MOPH, who will be appointed project coordinator.
It will be staffed by a full-time project administrator, recruited from senior
MOPH staff, an accountant and support staff. The Project Coordination Unit
will: (a) coordinate all project activities; (b) identify and take steps to
ensure prompt annd efficient implementation; (c) monitor project progress and
expenditures and arrange for the audit of project accounts; cnd (d) maintain
contact with the Bank. Before negotiations, the Government established the
project coordiation unit and appointed the project coordinator and the project
administrator. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the coordi-
nating unit properly staffed and vested with adequate powers will operate
through the closing date of the project, and agreement was reached regarding
the terms of reference of the administrator.
5.02      An Advisory Committee led by the Minister.of Public Health will
be set up to help to ensure that health, family planning and nutrition
services are properly integrated.  In addition to senior MOPEl staff, the
commitee will include the heads of ONPFP, INNTA, INE, CRFP, t:he two Medical
Schools and representatives of the ministries of Social Affairs, Education
and Equipment.  Annex 13 shows how the project would be organized.  Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the Health Advisory Committee will be
set up before March 31, 1982.

B. Implementation
5.03      Project activities will be carried out by various MOPH Directorates
and other Government Agencies, as indicated below:

- 36 -
5.04      Under the supervision of the Secretary General of t:he MOPH, the
Studies and Planning Directorate (SPD) would be responsible for implementing
the Management Information System (MIS) and making the necessary arrange-
ments for computer services with the National Computer Center (CNI). The
SPD will be assisted by an MIS specialist and the statisticians assigned
to each of the eight governorates; it would ensure the prompt. processing of
data for project monitoring and evaluation. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained that the contract with the CNI will be concluded by March 31,
1982 under terms satisfactory to the Bank.
5.05      The CRFP, in conjunction with the Health Training Unit of the MOPH,
will be responsible for adapting the curricula of paramedical. schools to the
Government's new health policy, and for retraining the teachErs. The Director
of the CRFP would organize and supervise the retraining of MCIPH personnel in
the eight governorates (see Annex 9 B.) The ONPFP, the INNTA and the INE
would take part in the retraining program. The Administration and Finance
Directorate of the MOPH would be responsible for the training of the middle-
level managers and for the selection of scholarship candidates. The timetable
for the training programs was reviewed and agreed upon during negotiations.
5.06      Under the supervision of the DBHS, the Health Training Unit of the
MOPH will be responsible for coordinating the health educaticn programs
of the country's principal health agencies, and for improving the quality and
effectivenes of the programs.
5.07      The DBHS will have the overall responsibility for the strengthening
of primary health care under the project. To this end the ONPFP, the INNTA
and the INE would ensure that their field staffs and activities in the project
area are integrated with those of the MOPH. To attract Tunisian doctors to
serve in rural areas the MOPH has agreed to set up a commission to determine
what incentives should be offered. The commission has been instructed to
submit its recommendations before December 1981.
5.08      The MOPH and regional authorities have started to select and acquire
sites for the new health facilities in locations chosen on the basis of dis-
tribution of population, accessibility, and the availability of safe water and
electricity.
5.09      The Equipment and Building Unit (EBU) of the MOPH will be respon-
sible for the supervision of the construction and remodeling program and for
the maintenance of MOPH facilities. The EBU, which has been recently rein-
forced and now has three architects and eight draftsmen, has actively partici-
pated in selection of locations for new health facilities. The EBU will
prepare the working drawings, equipment lists and bidding documents for the
project facilities. The project would provide further reinforcement for the
EBU in the form of consultant architectural services (4 man-years) and two
construction supervisors (6 man-years). The timetable for the construction
program and the supply of project-financed equipment and vehicles was reviewed
and agreed upon during negotiations.



- 37 -
5.10      The Project Coordinator will be responsible for monitoring and
evaluating the progress of the project and conducting a mid-term project
review. The SPD and the eight RDHs will be responsible for the prompt proces-
sing of the data necessary for the monitoring and evaluation of the project.
The project will provide for incremental cost of internal travel by project
management staff; this is considered necessary because of Government's low
ceiling on travel allocations which might adversely affect project management
and field supervision.
5.11      Based upon the mid-term evaluation of the project and the applied
research program, the MOPH will prepare a plan to extend the integrated health
delivery system to the whole country. The plan preparation will be undertaken
under the provision of the DBHS. The Director of the CRFP will select the
consultants for the implementation of the research program and prepare their
terms of reference in consultation with the Bank; he will also oversee the
studies and applied research program.
C. Programming and Budgeting
5.12      In each governorate, the RDHs will prepare:  (a) quarterly work
programs; and (b) annual budget proposals for review and consolidation by the
Project Coordinator and the DBHS. After the program has been approved by the
Health Advisory Committee, the Project Coordinating Unit would notify regional
authorities and excuting agencies accordingly, and forward the approved pro-
gram to the Administration and Finance Directorate of the MOPH for incorpora-
tion in the annual budget. Within 30 days of budget approval, the Project
Coordinator would notify the departments and agencies concerned of the approved
work programs and budgets. The flow of funds would follow established Govern-
ment procedures.
D. Project Monitoring and Evaluation
5.13      Regular monitoring and evaluation would be based on comparisons with
the first (baseline) year of operations. The Government considered the
possibility of undertaking a pre-project baseline survey, or monitoring a
control population outside the project area. With Bank concurrence, it
decided against both possibilities because of prohibitive costs (a baseline
survey would have cost at least US$0.5 million), technical difficulties and,
most serious, manpower implications.
5.14      Physical and financial progress will be monitored by the Project
Coordination Unit by comparing the established quarterly targets with quarterly
status reports from EBU and the RDH in each project governorate.
5.15      By providing systematic and timely data about project activity in
the eight governorates, the MIS would promote the speedy identification and
correction of problems. The MIS would rely on activity, performance and impact
indicators compiled monthly by health supervisors at dispensaries and consoli-



- 38 -
dated quarterly by the governorate statistician, who would then forward the
information to Tunis for analysis (See Annex 8 A). The specific indicators
would include:
(a) activity levels
(1) number of patients, total and new;
(2) number of women whose pregnancy becomes known before the
fifth month;.
(3) number of pregnant women benefitting from prenatal care;
(4) number of women undergoing prenatal antitetanus inoculation;
(5) number of hospital deliveries;
(6) new family planning acceptors;
(7) number of attended births; and
(8) proportion of infants followed during postnatal period
(b) Outreach and performance
(1) prevalence rate of family planning acceptors/number of
eligible couples;
(2) number of cases of acute child diarrhoea with dehydration/
total number of child diarrhoea cases reported;
(3) number of preschool children gaining weight normally/
total number of preschool children weighed;
(4)  number and type of child inoculations begun/total number
of eligible children;
(5) number of children completing immunization series/total
number of children registered for immunization series;
(6). number of persons receiving TB therapy/total number of,
TB cases reported;
(7) total number and type of communicable diseases reported.
(c)  Impact
(1) number of stillbirths;

(3) number of deaths of children under five years of age by
age category;
(4) number and types of new cases of diseases preventable by
immunization;
(5) age specific fertility rates.
5.16      The MIS would also collect and analyze data on recurrent costs of
the dispensary and outreach parts of the health system in project areas in
order to disaggregate the MOPH budget to permit specific provision for
financing the services placed under the authority of the DBHS. These data
would also make it possible to assess alternative unit costs for various
services provided at the peripheral level.
5.17      Data would be collected both in dispensaries and by visiting
nurses whose registers would record births, deaths and pregnancies in the
estimated 200 households in each assigned community. Supervisory staff
would check these registers periodically for completeness and at random for
accuracy.
5.18      The project coordinator and the DBHS will conduct a mid-term
evaluation of the project, focusing on the impact of the health policy, with
particular emphasis on the reduction of morbidity, mortality and fertility
and cost-effectiveness at the periphery. The evaluation will also include
the functioning of the new institutional set-up at the governorate level,
budget allocations for basic health services, logistics, maintenance and
data collection for the MIS. The mid-term review would provide an opportunity
to adjust project targets in the light of the experience gained during the
first two and a half years of project implementation. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that: (a) the mid-term review will be conducted
before January 31, 1984, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank,
and (b) remedial action, satisfactory to the Government and the Bank, will be
taken accordingly.
VI. JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Justification
6.01      The project would assist the government in achieving its objectives
of improving health and nutrition standards while slowing the rate of popula-
tion growth. When fully operational, at 90% coverage, project services would
reach about 2.25 million beneficiaries per year, including more than 700,000
persons now unserved, mainly in rural areas, by adequate health and family
planning measures. In the beneficiaries are included about 315,000 married
women of reproductive age and about 360,000 preschool children. The bulk of
project activity would take place in the Northwest and Central regions, where
income distribution is relatively uneven and significant proportions of the
population live in absolute or relative poverty. By increasing services in
these areas, the project thus would assist the government to attain its
objective of more equitable income distribution, while meeting basic human
needs.



- 40 -
6.02      Attempts to quantify the economic impact of improved health con-
ditions are limited by methodological difficulties and inadequate data.
The project would reduce the number of sick days and thereby contribute to
increased productivity. Although the exact amount cannot be calculated, the
increase would not have to be great to offset the incremental recurrent costs
of the health system supported by the proposed project. The incidence of
disease in Tunisia, as in several other countries, correlates with times of
peak demand for agricultural labor. Illustrative calculations indicate that
if, as a result of better health, each of the projected 600,0C0 full-time
workers in the project area would be able to work two extra days each year,
they would enjoy annual income gains of about US$4.5 million at minimum daily
agricultural wage rates, which would more than cover the $4 million incre-
mental operating costs in 1986 of the integrated health system in the project
governorates.
6.03      While the planned reduction of the birth-rate from 43 to 36 per
thousand in the project governorates is ambitious, it is attainable. Its
achievement would be an important contribution to the Government's objective
of reducing the crude birth rate for Tunisia from 35/1000 in 1976 to 30/1000
in 1986. Substantial unquantifiable benefits would also accrue from improved
child health and lower infant mortality. First, the survival of more children
promotes acceptance of family planning, since the parents attain the desired
family size earlier. Second, improved child health makes education more
effective. Third, the project should help to raise the quality, vigor and
productive capacity of the future work force.
B. Risks
6.04      The Government has clearly demonstrated its strong commitment to
the integrated health policy, which is also supported by local population,
community leaders and young public health physicians actively involved in
field operations. For its part, the MOPH has taken important steps during
project preparation to improve its administrative and planning capability.
Yet the project still faces three main risks. First, as in any large and
decentralized venture, effective coordination and implementation may prove
difficult to achieve. For that reason, the MOPH is establishing a separate
Directorate of Basic Health services whose capabilities will be further
reinforced by Project financed technical assistance. The establishment
of the Health Advisory Committee chaired by the Health Minister, and the
appointment of a project coordinator would promote smooth coordination among
the participating agencies and within the Ministry. Further, the lessons
learned from the IDA Population project have been taken into account in
preparing the present project. The country has a well-developed construction
industry, which can manage the civil works proposed under the project.
Moreover, adequate supervision of the construction program would be assured
through project-financed consultant services. Finally, the technical and
managerial feasibility of the proposed project activities has already been
proven in Medjez-el-Bab. Nevertheless, sustained Government efforts will be



- 41 -
required to ensure full cooperation by agencies like the ONPFP and the INNTA,
accustomed to a high degree of autonomy, in the integrated delivery of services
which they formerly provided separately.
6.05      A second risk is the possibility of lingering resistance to the
shift of emphasis to rural areas and preventive medecine. The frequent
changes of Health Minister--there have been five since 1975--have hampered
continuity of MOPH leadership and enabled part of the medical establishment
to resist such changes as decentralization of administration. However that
attitude is changing as a result of more than four years of implementation of
the integrated policy, particularly in view of the tangible results achieved
so far, and the positive reactions from populations concerned.
6.06      A third risk is the historical difficulty of recruiting Tunisian
physicians to serve in rural areas. This risk is being offset by the rapidly
increasing output of domestic medical graduates, the reversal of the outflow
of physicians to other countries, and a leveling off of competing opportuni-
ties in the private sector. In addition, the Government has appointed a
Commission to report by December 1981 on the incentives necessary to attract
physicians to public health posts in rural areas.
VII. Recommendations
7.01      Before negotiations, the Government:
(a)  Appointed the project coordinator and the project administrator
(para. 5.01);
(b)  Designated the Director of Basic Health Services (para. 3.10),
and appointed the eight physicians in charge of basic health
services in the eight project governorates (para. 3.10).
7.02      During negotiations, the following were reviewed and found
satisfactory:
(a)  Main topics to be included in the applied research
program (para. 3.13);
(b)  Revisions to be made to Final architectural designs for health
posts, dispensaries and vehicle maintenance workshops (paras.
3.21 and 3.22);

7.03      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that:
(a)  The terms of reference for consultants and specialists will
be satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.43);
(b)  The sites for the four new urban dispensaries (para 3.21), the
eight vehicle maintenance workshops (para 3.22), and the two
regional health education centers (para 3.28) will be acquired
before December 31, 1981;
(c)  The revision of curricula for the second and third year of
paramedical schools, and the three-year program for high-
level technicians, will be completed in time to be introduced
at the begining of each academic year, starting in October 1982
(para. 3.40);
(d)  Tunisian counterparts will be appointed before the arrival of
the three technical assistance specialists (para. 3.43);
(e)  Project accounts for each fiscal year will be audited by the
Ministry of Planning and Finance, and that the results of
all audits will be forwarded to the Bank not later than six
months after the end of the Government fiscal year. Certi
ficates of expenditure will be audited internally at least
once every six months, and that the relevant certificates and
audit reports retained by the MOPH for examination by Bank
review missions; these reports will show, inter alia, that the
funds withdrawn were used for the purposes intended, the goods
had been received, work performed, and that payment had been
made (para. 4.12);
(f)  The coordinating unit properly staffed and vested with adequate
powers will operate through the closing date of the project (para.
5.01);
(g)  The Health Advisory Committee will be set up before March 31,
1982 (para. 5.02); and
(h)  The contract with the CNI will be concluded by March1 31,
1982 under terms satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5.04);
(i)  The mid-term project review will be conducted beforle January 31,
1984 under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank and
remedial action, satisfactory to the Government and the Bank
will be taken accordingly (para. 5.18).
Condition of Effectiveness
7.04      The appointment of the Director of Basic Health Services will be a
condition of effectiveness (para. 3.10).
