1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design


1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country background
1.     During project preparation, Senegal’s economy was growing steadily but with
unequal poverty reduction impacts in urban and rural areas. Compared to an average
growth rate of 6 percent in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), growth in Senegal
averaged 4 percent between 2000 and 2005. However, the impact of the economic growth
was inequitable. Significant gaps existed between rural and urban Senegal in terms of
income, education, health, and access to modern services. Poverty incidence ranged from
44 to 59 percent of the population in urban areas but was higher in rural areas, varying
from 72 to 88 percent.

Sector background
2.      Electricity access was low in rural areas and unreliable in urban areas. Less than 4
percent of Senegal’s villages were estimated to have electricity, and in the electrified
villages, less than 30 percent of households have electricity connections. An electricity
network was mainly available in the capital city, Dakar, and four urban centers: St-Louis,
Kaolack, Ziguinchor and Tambacounda. But supply in these cities was sometimes
interrupted during peak demand periods, as the low installed power capacity, running
mostly on costly imported fuel, was struggling to meet the electricity demand growing at
a pace of 25 – 30 MW a year.

3.      Recognizing the electricity access challenges and limited financing, the
Government of Senegal (GoS) pursued reforms to promote private sector participation.
The foundation of these reforms rests on the 1998 Electricity Law (98-29), which
provided the sector legal, regulatory, and institutional framework. The law promotes
private sector involvement in electricity generation and distribution through delivery of
concessions and licenses under the oversight of an independent electricity sector
regulator, established later as the Commission de Régulation du Secteur de l’Electricité
(CRSE). The law also calls for scaling up rural electrification by transferring
responsibility to service rural areas from SENELEC - the national power utility who used
to have a monopoly in electricity generation, transmission, and distribution - to a
dedicated rural electrification agency, set up in 1999 as the Agence Sénégalaise
d’Electrification Rurale (ASER).

4.       The government’s commitment to rural electrification was later reinforced in the
2004 Rural Electrification Development Policy Letter. The policy letter sets a target to
increase rural electrification rate to 30 percent by 2015 and clarified ASER’s operating
mechanisms. Two main mechanisms for involving the private sector in rural electricity
generation and distribution were identified: large-scale concessions and locally sponsored
electrification initiatives, known as ERIL (Electrification Rurale par Initiatives Locales)
or smaller concessions. To facilitate the implementation of concessions, the country was
divided in 18 geographical areas, corresponding to 18 large-scale concessions.

                                             1
5.      In the energy-for-cooking subsector, wood fuel harvest for charcoal production
was unsustainable, despite encouraging results from community-based forest
management. The World Bank-financed Sustainable and Participatory Energy
Management Project, known as PROGEDE I, effective since 1997, was being
implemented and nearing completion. The project had successfully initiated community-
based forest management practices to reduce widespread rural wood fuel exploitation for
charcoal production and sales by urban-based traders. It closed in December 2004 with a
highly satisfactory rating.

Rationale for Bank involvement
6.      The main rationale for the Bank’s involvement was to bring international
experience and trust to set up a public-private partnership framework for providing
electricity services to rural areas. Given the government’s two unsuccessful attempts to
privatize SENELEC in 2000 and 2002, and its strategy to implement concessions in rural
areas, the involvement of the Bank, as an “honest broker?, was thought to be critical to
establishing a framework that could leverage investments from the private sector and
multilateral/bilateral development agencies. The project was the first of its kind that
helped pioneer the public –private sector partnerships in the delivery rural electrification
services in Sub Saharan countries.

7.      The project contributed to achieving the 2003 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS)’s third objective: to improve living conditions among the poor and vulnerable
groups. It sought to increase access to electricity services in rural areas, support
productive uses for income generation, and scale up community-based wood fuel
management, which constituted a means for improving the living conditions of the poor.
The project’s focus on involving private operators also contributed to developing a
private market and associated employment sector, thereby facilitating wealth creation,
another strategic pillar of the CAS.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
8.      The project's development objective is to increase the access of Senegal's rural
population to modern energy services and to ensure the environmental and social
sustainability of wood fuels in urban and peri-urban areas.

9.      The key project development objective indicators, as presented in the credit
agreement, covered not only IDA/GEF financing but also other participating donors. The
indicators are:

     10.     The outcome indicator target for electricity access (35,000 connections) includes
     connections to be achieved through parallel financing. The original financing plan of the
     project involves IDA/GEF financing and parallel financing from other donors and the
     GoS. The parallel financing was to materialize through separate financing agreements
     between other donors and ASER. At appraisal, the African Development Bank (AfDB)
     and KFW/GIZ confirmed parallel financing. Other parallel financing was expected from
     the French Development Agency (AFD) and the European Union. The GoS was also
     expected to not only provide counterpart financing but also parallel financing in a form of
     budget for programmatic village electrification.

     11.     The project was designed as the first of a three-phase adaptable program, whose
     objective was to support the transformation and improvement in the living conditions of
     rural Senegal by: (i) providing lighting and access to modern communication to rural
     households, (ii) improving delivery of social services by providing electricity to potable
     water delivery systems, health clinics, schools, etc., and (iii) enhancing economic
     productivity through the provision of electricity for productive purposes. Moving from
     the project (phase 1 or APL1) to subsequent phases (APL2 and APL3) was subject to a
     number of conditions including timely completion of the concessions. Because the
     project (phase 1)’s implementation was delayed and the number of concessions was later
     reduced from 18 to 10, the subsequent phases were dropped. It should, however, be noted
     that the project (phase 1) is being followed up by a technical assistance operation under
     the Sustainable Energy for All initiative.

12.    For this ICR, the analysis and evaluation will be conducted against the
development objective of the project (phase 1 of the program or APL1).

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
13.     The program will have a positive environmental impact at the global and local
levels. At the global level, it will help reduce net CO2 emissions. At the local level, it
will promote conservation by encouraging the use of: (i) renewable sources of energy; (ii)
efficient lamps and improved cooking stoves; (iii) improved carbonization methods and
improved wood fuel stoves. It will also continue implementation of sustainable forest and
natural resource management that will also reduce deforestation.

14.   Although no GEO indicators were explicitly included in the GEF Trust Fund
Agreement, the results framework indicates the following key GEO indicator:
     Net CO2 emissions reduction and conservation promotion by encouraging the use
      of renewable sources of energy, efficient lamps and improved cookstoves,
      improved carbonization methods, and improved wood fuel stoves. The indicator
      target is 8,000 tons of CO2 emissions reduced.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

17.       The project’s main expected beneficiaries, grouped by intervention areas, were:

Rural electrification (Component 1, 2, and 3)
    Households, small businesses, health centers, and schools located in the three
       concessions areas financed by IDA ((i) Dagana-Podor-St-Louis, (ii) Mbour, (iii)
       Kolda-Velingara): would gain access to on-grid and off-grid electricity, supplied
       by private operators that will be awarded large or small-scale (ERIL) concessions

         ASER: would be provided with four new staff, training, information technology
          equipment, vehicles, and technical assistance in a number of activities including
          the development of local electrification plans, multi-sectorial energy programs
          (PREMs), monitoring & evaluation system and the implementation of a
          communication and education plan.

         CRSE: would receive support for study tours to countries with relevant regulatory
          experience and for participation in regional and international regulatory forums. It

                                               4
       was also expected to receive assistance in carrying out studies on specific rural
       electrification regulatory aspects.

      The Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM): would receive support for training
       and workshop participation or organization and technical assistance in conducting
       specific studies.

Sustainable and participatory wood fuels management (PROGEDE transition component:
component 4)
    100 village-level communities in the Sedhiou, Bakel, and Kedougou sub-regions
       would receive small tools and field equipment to put 230,000 ha of forest under
       sustainable community-based management. They would benefit from the
       proceeds of fuel wood, charcoal sales, and other income-generating activities
       supported by the project.

      Forest services covering the 100 villages, where community-based forest
       management will be practiced, would receive office and field equipment to
       support the communities in their activities (carbonization units, agro-forestry
       enterprises, fuel wood markets)

      Energy Directorate and Forestry Directorate: both would receive office supplies
       including computers and energy database software (household cooking energy
       data, forestry data).

1.7 Original Components (as approved)

18.     The project comprises four components: Three of the four components support
rural electrification and the fourth component supports sustainable access to wood fuels
for cooking.

Component 1 - Financing of investments (IDA: US$16.25 million; GEF: US$3.6 million)
19.    The component was to provide output-based capital subsidies, refinancing and
guarantees to support both rural electrification, and multi-sectorial energy sub-projects
(promoting productive uses of electricity) in three rural concession areas - Dagana-Podor,
Mbour, and Kolda-Velingara. Providing capital subsidies was deemed necessary to
ensure sustainability of rural electrification. The component was also to finance the
preparation of rural electrification proposals from community-based organizations.

Component 2 - Capacity development and institutional strengthening (IDA: US$2.55
million; GEF: US$0.4 million)
20.    The component was to strengthen the capacities of institutions involved in the
implementation of the project to enable them to play their role efficiently. It was to
provide training and technical assistance to ASER (including the administration of the
Rural Electrification Fund), CRSE, MEM, and a Multi-Sectorial Committee in charge of
promoting productive uses of electricity.


                                            5
Component 3 – Implementation, Communication, Monitoring & Evaluation (IDA:
US$2.25 million; GEF: US$0.55 million)
21.      The component was to support productive and social uses of electrification, local
electrification initiatives, outreach and monitoring. The support was to cover:
     Establishment of a committee responsible for promoting productive uses of
         electricity in the three rural areas to be electrified (CIMES); and preparation and
         implementation of productive uses activities.
     Preparation of community-based electrification initiatives and piloting some of
         the prepared initiatives.
     Information, education, and communication campaigns on the rural electrification
         project
     Monitoring and evaluation activities including auditing and reporting

Component 4 – Sustainable Wood Fuel Supply Management, Demand Management and
Inter-fuel Substitution Options (IDA: US$4.1 million)
22.     The component, known as PROGEDE transition phase, was to support supply and
demand-side interventions to improve access to sustainable wood fuels for cooking. On
the supply side, the component was to finance activities to consolidate gains from the
PROGEDE I, such as (i) community-based management of 230,000 ha of forest in the
Sedhiou, Bakel and Kedougou departments, and (ii) acquisition of small tools, field and
office equipment, and other materials for the rural communities, the regional offices of
the Forest Service/Directorate, and agro-forestry enterprises. On the demand side, the
component was to provide technical assistance and office equipment for the Directorate
of Energy and the Directorate of Water and Forests, as well as finance selected studies;
demonstration pilots (i.e. charcoal briquettes, biofuels, etc.); interfuel substitution; and
publicity/communication services for the promotion of improved cookstoves.

23.     Although the number and headings of the project components were unchanged,
the first and fourth components’ scope was slightly modified, following the mid-term
review:

      Component 1: two sub-components were added. The first to finance in-house
       electrical wiring, meters, and other equipment necessary to connect new rural
       customers to power grid recently constructed through the government emergency
       rural electrification program. The second to finance small diesel generators and
       transformers to provide back up. The additions were requested by the Government
       to address pressing demands for electricity given delays in the concessions
       implementation. About US$1.25 million was reallocated to finance the additions.

      Component 4: the component’s closing date (initially December 2007) was
       extended to continue the consolidation of community-based forest management
       activities until the preparation of a separate PROGEDE II project. US$ 2.7 million
       were reallocated to the component.

1.9 Other significant changes

                                             6
24.    The project was restructured twice. The first restructuring extended the project
closing date for three and a half years, from June 30, 2009, to December 31, 2012 to
account for delays in awarding rural concessions. The second restructuring cancelled
SDR 6.4 million from the original credit and changed the delivery of output-based
subsidies to improve disbursement. The partial cancellation was done as part of a
comprehensive performance improvement plan developed after change of project
supervision leadership. It was informed by both implementation progress on the ground
and detailed disbursement forecasts that considered concessionaires' investment
schedules. The cancellation allowed the reallocation of predicted undisbursed funds to the
energy sector financing in Senegal.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

25.      The project was prepared based on a comprehensive background analysis
involving different stakeholders. Over 15 studies were conducted mainly to inform the
design of the concession approach. The studies included, among others, the definition of
the geographic limits of rural concession areas, the development of electrification plans
for three concession areas to provide private operators with background information for
bid preparation, the preparation of concession award procedures, the design of the rural
electrification fund, and the analysis of international and local private sector’s interest in
the concession approach. Emphasis was put on the design of the large-scale concessions
with the consideration that small-scale concessions constitute short-term mechanisms to
address electrification needs in villages that were not in the large-scale concession’s
electrification priority plan for the first three years. Small-scale concessions were to be
later transferred under the management of large-scale concessions owners. The studies’
findings were shared and discussed through workshops with key government agencies
(ASER, MEM, and CRSE) and multilateral and bilateral development agencies including
the AfDB, KFW, GTZ, and AFD.

26.     The project was the first ever large-scale electricity concession project in rural
areas, financed by the Bank in Sub-Saharan Africa, and its design incorporated
innovative features and lessons learned. The rural electrification approach based on
concessions was the first ever public-private partnership model to be implemented in
rural areas in Senegal. The rationale for its adoption lies on the strong need for
complementing limited funding from the government and development agencies with
significant investments from the private sector, and on the private sector’s greater
capacity and expertise to ensure cost-effectiveness in rural electrification and operate and
maintain the network. The government and donors’ funding was provided as subsidies
tied to the concession bidding process, making it an output-based delivery of investment
subsidies. The design of the output-based scheme was informed by lessons that pointed
out that investment subsidies to private sector are more effective when they are provided
based on service output. The project also included a subcomponent, known as PREMs, to


                                              7
promote productive and social uses of electricity, reflecting lessons learned from impacts
assessments of rural electrification programs that revealed the importance of
complementing rural electrification programs with multi-sector measures to increase
income, and thereby contributing to ensure financial viability of rural electrification.

27.     The government’s commitment to the project’s concession-based approach was
adequate overall. During the project preparation, the government divided rural areas into
18 geographic areas to facilitate the implementation of rural concessions. It continued to
provide ASER with an operating budget and fulfilled conditions required to establish the
rural electrification fund. The government reiterated its commitment to the concession
approach in the Rural Electrification Development Policy Letter, issued in July 2004, and
signed by both the Minister of Energy and Mines and the Minister of Economy and
Finance. The letter confirms the adoption of both large-scale and small-scale concession
approaches, establishes a rural electrification fund as the main financing mechanism, and
separates the geographic service areas of ASER from that of SENELEC. The letter sets
out the government’s plan to pursue an emergency rural electrification program to help
increase the rural electrification rate to 62 percent by 2022 from 12.5 percent in 2003. It
also authorizes SENELEC to create a separate subsidiary utility that is allowed to
compete with international private operators for concessions.

28.     Although the project rightly identified a number of risks, some were overlooked.
International and local private sector’s interest in rural concessions was rated high and
the implementation of the proposed mitigation measure—extensive consultations with
potential private operators—successfully addressed the risk. In contrast, ASER’s capacity
to implement the project and CRSE’s capacity to regulate private operator interventions
were rightly rated high. However, the mitigation measure—ensure that key institution-
building elements for ASER and CRSE are in place during the project—lacked specifics.
Also, two risks were overlooked. The first is failure from SENELEC to cooperate in the
concession award process. Though SENELEC was not an implementing agency, its
agreement to let private operators extend its medium voltage network to connect rural
households was required at the concession contract negotiation stage. Also, SENELEC
did not react well to the end of its monopoly in rural areas, making it reluctant to engage
in the rural electrification project. Not accounting for SENELEC’s engagement risk
contributed to implementation delays. The second risk is the inability of various
stakeholders to work in a collaborative manner leading to timely decision-making. Key
inputs in the concession award were provided by not only ASER, CRSE, and SENELEC,
but also MEM, MEF’s procurement control unit, and private operators. Such multiple
interventions raise coordination and collaboration challenges that should have been
considered in the risk analysis. In sum, given the innovative nature of the project, the risk
analysis should have been more comprehensive and the mitigation measures should have
provided for a longer implementation timeframe.


2.2 Implementation




                                             8
29.      The project implementation was significantly delayed as the time for concession
awards and putting in place the appropriate regulatory framework was greatly
underestimated. Award of the first concession took three years, instead of one year as
initially planned. Award of the second and third concessions also took longer, due to an
unsuccessful first biding. After the first concession award, approving service regulations,
which govern electricity delivery to consumers including tariffs, metering, and service
quality aspects took 22 months. Also, the implementation of the ERIL component (small-
scale concession) was delayed for about two years.

30.      The delays were caused by a combination of factors including the innovative
nature of the project, stakeholders’ reluctance to compromise, and ASER’s stretched
implementation capacity. The innovative and untested nature of the project gave rise to
implementation challenges. Procuring a rural concession was a first time experience for
government agencies and the World Bank supervision team. Therefore, thorough and
lengthy reviews involving ASER, CRSE, MEM, MEF’s procurement control unit, and
the WB were conducted to short list the firms and to evaluate the technical and financial
bids. SENELEC had to approve, for the first time, unfamiliar proposals of least-cost
electrification techniques (smaller section of wires, lighter electricity poles, Single Wire
Earth Return - SWER) from private operators. Approving, for instance, the SWER
technique, required a study tour in Tunisia. CRSE, who used to regulate only on urban
electricity production and distribution, lacked sample models for rural electrification, and
had to develop them.

31.     Stakeholders’ reluctance to compromise exacerbated delays. Collaboration
weakened as implementation difficulties arose. For instance, ASER, and CRSE, hosted in
the same building, had to go through the MEM to communicate and hold meetings.
SENELEC held strong resistance against least-cost electrification proposals, taking, for
example, six months to approve simplified standards proposed by the first concessionaire.
MEM’s commitment also weakened. It took two years to approve and issue procedures
guiding subsidy provision to promoters of small-scale electrification initiatives, which
delayed the implementation of the ERIL sub-component. MEM’s weakened commitment
was mainly due to its greater focus to urban electricity issues, with the 2009-2011
electricity sector crises, which increased in intensity in 2010-2011, causing widespread
load shedding in urban areas.

32.      The implementation of the government-funded emergency rural electrification
program distracted ASER from the concession approach and contributed to deterioration
in its financial health and institutional efficiency. From 2002 to 2009, ASER had been
receiving government funding through agreements to electrify about 560 villages, known
as the emergency rural electrification program. The program’s implementation did not
follow Bank fiduciary procedures1, but was however, considered as a complement to the



1
 Bank fiduciary procedures were applicable to IDA/GEF financing stipulated in the credit agreement.
Separate co-financing agreements were signed between other donors and ASER. Also, MEM and ASER
have agreements for implementing the emergency rural electrification program.

                                                  9
World Bank-financed project2. Mismanagement occurred in the use of the government’s
budget for the emergency rural electrification program (Bank financing was not affected).
A number of villages were electrified without appropriate government budget, and not
following national procurement guidelines, leading to ASER’s annual operating expenses
exceeding the government funding. This led to ASER’s debts amounting to 1.3 billion
CFA (about US$ 2.6 million). On the organizational side, since project effectiveness,
ASER’s staff has more than doubled - from 30 to 82 staff members – with recruitment
not related to the achievement of its mission. ASER’s management has changed three
times. Beyond the negative financial, organizational, and reputational impact,
implementing the emergency rural electrification program has distracted ASER focus
from the concession activities.

33.      The recent management change at ASER and MEM has brought positive
developments in the project implementation. Following the March 2012 elections, new
management was appointed at ASER and MEM. The new government reiterated rural
electrification as one of the top energy sector priorities. MEM has, since, demonstrated
strong leadership. It set up timelines for stakeholders to reach compromises, speeding up
implementation. For instance, under MEM’s oversight, CRSE and ONE, the first
concessionaire, agreed on the service regulation terms, that were initiated in 2011. MEM
also approved and issued the ERIL procedures and guidelines, prepared by ASER and
CRSE. MEM requested the review of the number of years that private operators should
guarantee their investments and the request was addressed in 3 weeks. It has been
proactive in addressing requests from ASER to accelerate implementation, and is
monitoring closely implementation progress with regular meetings with involved
stakeholders, which facilitates collaboration and problem solving. ASER’s new
management is making efforts to improve the agency’s financial health and efficiency. A
financial recovery and internal re-organization plan, prepared by an independent
consulting firm, is being finalized.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

34.     M&E design: The project’s M&E system consisted of various platforms including
Excel-based database and geographic information system (GIS). The Excel-based
database integrates the results framework indicators and M&E guidance that were
defined at project appraisal, as well as information collected through baseline surveys and
post surveys of electrified villages. The GIS incorporates socio-economic data on villages
and is used to map out transmission and distribution lines as they are constructed. The
M&E system was enhanced with Bank financing to consolidate existing M&E platforms
into one system and make it web-based and more user-friendly. ASER led the M&E
system modernization in a participative manner, incorporating inputs from a task force
made up of representatives from ASER, CRSE, Department of Electricity, planning
division of MEM, CIMES (multi-sectorial committee), and GIZ. The M&E enhancement
was delayed by: (i) slow approval of the M&E operational plan by the World Bank

2
 The Bank financed in-house wiring for 2,639 households, enabling their connection to grid constructed
under the emergency rural electrification program. Also the project appraisal document indicates that the
government was expected to contribute to the project through parallel co-financing.

                                                    10
(about 6 months3), (ii) replacement of the first recruited M&E consultant who passed
away, and (iii) integration of gender and emissions reduction aspects that were not
initially planned.

35.    M&E implementation: The enhanced M&E system includes a result framework
anchored by 50 indicators at different levels - inputs, outputs, outcomes, and
development objective – and appropriate for monitoring progress towards the project and
environment development objective. For each indicator, means of verification,
assumptions & risks, data collection methods, and institutional responsibility are defined.
The M&E system goes beyond the PDO to track rural electrification impacts on
economic and social development as well as on achieving MDGs. It is being set up,
which involves upgrading the former M&E and linking the GIS platform to the recently
developed version. After completing the M&E upgrade, ASER plans to link it to data
platforms from concessionaires and SENELEC, providing a real-time M&E platform
capable to provide data on the project’s outputs and outcomes.

36.    M&E utilization: The former M&E system was used to monitor the project and
the enhanced system will be the primary M&E tool moving forward. ASER used Excel
spreadsheets to monitor progress against indicator targets and prepare progress reports
and action plans for accelerated implementation. With the GIS, ASER captured progress
in network construction, household connections, and new socio-economic infrastructure.
Moving forward, the upgraded M&E system will constitute the main tool for monitoring
carbon reduction, under the Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement signed with the
World Bank-Carbon Finance. The system will also provide ASER with a monitoring and
impact assessment tool that will inform the government’s overall M&E system put in
place to monitor progress towards targets set in the 2012 Energy Sector Development
Policy Letter.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

37.     Safeguards: Project implementation complied with safeguards requirements
despite minor shortcomings. The Bank supervision team lacked a Safeguards Specialist
during the first four implementation years. This did not however impact safeguards
compliance as no concessions were officially awarded during that period and ASER’s
Director of Studies and Information Systems, who is a trained social and environmental
specialist, has been handling safeguards aspects. Since 2009, supervision missions
included a WB Safeguards Specialist who delivered on-the-ground training to ASER staff
and monitored safeguard aspects. ASER, with World Bank assistance, successfully
conducted public consultations and supported concessionaires in preparing environmental
& social management plans (ESMP). ONE included environmental and social clauses in
contracts with contractors. ASER attempted to develop a guidance note on the
preparation and implementation of ESMPs, and to hire an Environmental and Social

 World Bank supervision team was heavily involved in assisting the government to address the severe
electricity crisis striking urban centers. This affected prompt response to no-objection requests.

                                                  11
Specialist, but has lacked sufficient budget. These are however planned under the
ongoing organizational restructuring.

38.     Financial management: A comprehensive assessment of ASER’s financial
management capacities was conducted at project preparation and led to enhancements by
project effectiveness. ASER maintained financial management satisfactorily the first two
project implementation years. But, since 2008, financial management has deteriorated
with difficulties in mobilizing timely government co-financing and insufficient
government budget. ASER had been using IDA financing to pre-finance services, goods
and works that should have been funded by the government co-financing (US$50,000 in
2011). It also used IDA financing to pre-finance its operating expenses (US$164,000 in
2011), despite World Bank advance warning not to. ASER had, however, regularly
reimbursed ineligible expenses. Another issue was ASER’s weak internal control
mechanisms for the government budget, which is being addressed as part of the financial
recovery and internal re-organization plan.

39.     It should be noted that the 2010 Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP)
indicated that financial management should have been rated unsatisfactory. The ICR team
acknowledges the seriousness of financial management issues, but suggests a balanced
assessment, taking into consideration financial management improvements. Project’s
accounting was regularly updated; interim financial reports were submitted on time and
their quality was satisfactory; and the financial recovery and internal re-organization plan
is being implemented.

40.     Procurement: Although procurement complied with Bank requirements, it was
significantly delayed. Procuring the first concession financed by the Bank took about
three years due to: (i) high learning curve – first time for all involved stakeholders – for
firms short listing and bids evaluation; (ii) slow approval from the Ministry of Economy
and Finance; and (iii) lengthy negotiations between SENELEC and pre-selected operators
over technical network standards. Also the procurement of the second and third
concessions were delayed by unsuccessful first bids and had to be re-launched. ASER’s
project procurement staff was also involved in procuring works and services under the
government-funded emergency rural electrification program.



2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

41.     The experience gained has paved the way for an accelerated implementation and
completion of the rural concessions. Despite the delays, six concessions, as initially
planned, were awarded to international private operators, who constructed on-grid and
mini-grid networks covering 186 villages. With the recent approval of electricity service
regulations, one operator, ONE, is ramping up in-house wiring and meter installation to
connect 8,836 households starting in August 2013. The approved regulations were
applied to two World Bank-financed concessions, and will be applicable to the remaining
four awarded concessions, saving considerable time. Also, least-cost electrification
techniques are now well accepted by SENELEC, which will avoid delays in negotiating

                                            12
the remaining four concessions not yet financed. The ERILs assistance guidelines and
procedures have been issued and will facilitate the acceleration of the sub-component.

42.     Besides the network construction and regulatory gains, MEM is monitoring the
project closely. The Minister of Energy and Mines’ cabinet is setting up a coordination
committee, under his leadership, and comprising the heads of ASER, CRSE, and
SENELEC. The committee will meet monthly or as needed, to discuss emerging issues
and work out solutions. This will provide a platform to quickly address emerging issues
and facilitate the operationalization of the concessions.

43.    The project continues to be financed by a number of multi-lateral and bilateral
development agencies, including AfDB, KfW, AFD and the European Union. The
European Union extended its financing closing date for two years and planned to scale up
the scope of their activities in rural electrification in Senegal. The AfDB also plans to
grant a closing date extension. KFW envisions scaling up its support in the ERIL
component.

44.     Moving forward, the World Bank is providing technical assistance to strengthen
rural electrification operations and plans. Under the Sustainable Energy for All initiative,
funding was mobilized to assist ASER in a number of areas including: (i) improvement of
ASER’s financial health and operational efficiency through the implementation of the
financial recovery and reorganization plan, and (ii) planning for universal energy access
by 2030, through the development of local electrification plans for two concessions areas
lacking financing, and the preparation of long-term energy access plans along with an
investment prospectus to facilitate leveraging financing. The Bank will consider a new
IDA operation once the management and performance of ASER has been strengthened.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

45.    The project’s objective, design and implementation are highly relevant to current
country and global priorities and to the Bank’s FY2013-2017 Country Partnership
Strategy.

46.     Relevance of design: The project’s approach and implementation arrangements
build on the regulatory and institutional framework provided in the Electricity Law (98-
24). Considering the law’s provision to increase electricity access through delivery of
concessions to private operators and the need for complementing limited funding from
donors and the government with capital from the private sector, the project opted to
provide investment subsidies to attract private operators to invest in designed concession
areas. The components for implementing the concessions were well designed, based on
comprehensive studies and thorough analysis of private sector interest involving
extensive consultations with international and local private sector as well as bilateral
development agencies. Instead of establishing a separate, external unit to implement rural

                                            13
electrification activities, the project gave implementing responsibilities to ASER, which
was mandated by the Electricity Law to promote rural electrification with regulatory
inputs from CRSE, and included capacity building and institutional strengthening
activities. This allowed trained staff to remain in place after project end, sustaining
capacity enhancements.

47.     Relevance of objective and design to country priorities: The project’s objective to
increase access to electricity and sustainable cooking fuels for rural population remains a
priority for the government. The October 2012 Energy Sector Development Policy Letter,
issued by the President, sets the objective to ensure sustainable supply of household
cooking fuels-which was part of the project objective-and set the target of 50 percent of
rural electrification rate by 2017, which builds on the project objective to increase
electricity access. To reach the objective and target, the letter calls for expanding
community-based forest management systems and addressing constraints that led to
delays in implementing the project-designed concessions, highlighting the relevance of
the project’s approach to both community-based forest management and rural
concessions. The policy letter’s action plan consistently includes activities to increase
forest areas under community-based sustainable management and complete the
implementation of concessions awarded through the project.

48.    Relevance of objective and design to global priorities: The project-initiated public-
private partnership to dramatically increase rural electricity access contributes to
achieving Senegal’s universal energy access by 2030, one of the three goals of the
Sustainable Energy for All, a global initiative launched in September 2011 by the UN
Secretary General, and strongly supported by the World Bank Group, whose President
now co-chaired the initiative’s high-level Advisory Group. As part of the World Bank
Group’s commitment to the initiative, the Bank’s Energy Sector Management Assistance
Program (ESMAP) has set up a Sustainable Energy for All Facility that provide resources
to World Bank regional energy units to assist selected countries-including Senegal-to
move towards universal energy access by 2030.

49.     Relevance of objective and design to Bank partnership strategy: The project’s
increased rural electricity access objective is one of the expected outcomes (outcome 9B)
from the Bank’s FY2013-2017 Country Partnership Strategy, under the first pillar –
accelerating growth and generating employment. The Bank strategy mentions support for
both sustainable management of household cooking fuels, which was facilitated by the
project’s PROGEDE transition component, and for rural electrification through assistance
from the Sustainable Energy for All. The assistance has been launched and builds on the
project’s concession approach and results to assess remaining gaps towards universal
rural electricity access, and develop an investment prospectus. The project’s objective
and design, therefore, provides a strong basis upon which current lending and assistance
is provided, which indicates its relevance to Bank strategy and interventions.

50.    Relevance of implementation: Project implementation responded to changing
circumstances. Acknowledging delays in awarding and implementing concessions, the
Bank restructured the project component 1 to finance in-house wiring and meter


                                            14
installation, allowing thousands of households to be connected to electricity network
constructed with the government parallel financing. The Bank also changed project
supervision leadership to enable closer monitoring and guidance. A second restructuring
changed the investment subsidy delivery mechanisms, and contributed to increased
disbursement and accelerated implementation. Besides, the inclusion of the PROGEDE
transition phase component was a sound strategic move that responded to government’s
needs and enabled it to continue key successful activities, maintaining momentum
generated by the PROGEDE I till the preparation of a separate investment lending
operation (PROGEDE II). The project also showed responsiveness in reallocating
proceeds to provide an additional US$2.7 million to implement remaining activities and
consolidate the achievements of PROGEDE I.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives

51.     This section analyses the project’s overall efficacy by breaking down the
development objective in two parts (PDO – (a) and PDO – (b)) and evaluating the GEF
objective separately. The analysis revealed an overall moderately satisfactory
achievement of development and GEF objectives.

PDO – (a) to increase the access of Senegal's rural population to modern energy
services
52.     Outcome: 20,386 households, productive and social users gained access to
electricity by project closing; below the initial target of 35,000 households to be reached
through financing from all donors including the GoS, as presented in the credit
agreement. Out of the 20,386 connections:
     16,089 households and productive users gained electricity access through the
        implementation of the government of Senegal’s emergency rural electrification
        program (which is similar to the ERIL approach) by ASER
     2,639 households gained electricity access with World Bank financing in-house
        wiring and meters acquisition and installation to enable connection to electricity
        network constructed under the Government-funded emergency program.
     1,503 households and productive users received electricity connections through a
        the implementation of a small-scale concession (ERIL) financed by KFW/GIZ
        that enabled the installation of solar home systems (SHS) and the construction of
        hybrid (diesel-solar) power plants and mini grids in 73 villages.
     131 households and community facilities gained electricity through three small-
        scale concessions (ERIL) financed jointly by the World Bank and the Netherlands
        cooperation.
     24 solar home systems where installed as part of tests in a large-scale concession
        financed by the AFD

53.     Outputs from the Bank and Co-financiers: Excluding the GoS-supported
emergency program, the project led to 6 awarded concessions—as initially targeted—
resulting in the construction of a network covering 186 villages by the closing date
(please see more details in Table 1). The village breakdown by source of financing is:

                                            15
      66 villages through the first Bank-financed concession. The concessionaire, ONE,
       rapidly expanded the network construction, covering 116 villages by April 2013.
       During the ICR mission, ONE was installing first solar homes systems (SHS)
       through the concession approach, and successfully tested the operation of public
       lighting in 9 villages. The second Bank-financed concession was recently
       awarded to STEG, the Tunisian power utility, and network construction has not
       yet begun.
      47 villages through the AfDB-financed concession
      73 villages through KFW/GIZ-supported ERIL

exceeded. The private operators that were awarded the six concessions and three small-
scale concessions (ERIL) committed in their concession contracts to provide electricity to
107,799 customers. ICR ratings are based on the number of 20,386 customers that were
connected by project close. However, the 35,000 connections target is expected to be
reached by December 31, 2014 and over 100,000 customers are expected to be connected
by 2030.

PDO – (b) and to ensure the environmental and social sustainability of wood fuels in
urban and peri-urban areas.
55.     The project’s PROGEDE transition component ensured environmental
sustainability of wood fuel provision to urban and peri-urban areas through the
establishment of participatory management of wood fuel production, afforestation, and
biodiversity conservation. The component developed community-based forest
management plans whose implementation brought 289,116 ha of forest under the
management of village organizations, exceeding the initial target of 230,000 ha. The
community-based forest management involved harvesting an amount of wood fuel, for
charcoal production, that can be replaced through natural forest growth and afforestation,
ensuring the sustainability of wood fuel production to meet the energy-for-cooking needs
of urban and peri-urban households. 65,817 tons of charcoal was produced per year in a
sustainable manner; exceeding the target of 60,000 tons. Also, 81,908 ha of community-
based biodiversity conservation reserves were established in three villages along the
perimeter of the National Niokolo Kobal Park, contributing to fight against the loss of
specific vegetal and animal species.

56.     The social sustainability was ensured through the empowerment of community-
based organizations leading to increased revenues in villages. Charcoal production from
wood fuel collection has shifted from commercial exploitation by urban-based traders to
participatory management by 465 village and inter-village organizations. The
community-based management involved pre-defined revenue sharing schemes that
enabled charcoal proceeds to trickle down to village inhabitants. In addition to charcoal
production, the component supported various income generation activities including
intensive farming, gardening, animal breeding, and enhanced apiculture that resulted to
additional income. The total income increase was estimated at US$14.6 million per year,

                                                    17
over the double of the initial target of US$6 million – and contributed significantly to
reducing poverty in the participating villages.

57.     The implementation of the PROGEDE transition component has led to three key
reforms undertaken by the government in the household cooking energy sub-sector. First,
the GoS eliminated charcoal quota system that favored wholesale traders from urban
areas. Second, it restricted charcoal production only in sustainability managed forests.
Third, it revised the 1998 forestry code, in order to adapt tax regulations and provide
higher returns to local communities. These reforms were informed by: (i) the knowledge
of sustainable wood fuel harvesting volume, now available thanks to the implementation
of community-based forest management plans in the PROGEDE component, and (ii) the
realization of poverty reduction potential from revenues made by village organizations.
The reforms have been “game-changers? in wood fuel management and supply and are
very important achievements as biomass continues to dominate national energy
consumption patterns.

GEO: The program will have a positive environmental impact at the global and local
levels. At the global level, it will help reduce net CO2 emissions. At the local level, it
will promote conservation by encouraging the use of: (i) renewable sources of energy;
(ii) efficient lamps and improved cooking stoves; (iii) improved carbonization methods
and improved wood fuel stoves. It will also continue implementation of sustainable
forest and natural resource management which will also reduce deforestation.




                                               18
58.     Outcome: The project has helped reduce 604,045 tons of CO2 emissions,
exceeding the project’s target of 8,000 tons. The emission reduction can be broken down
as follows:
      587,045 tons of CO2 reduction achieved through the reduction of deforestation,
        the use of 205,728 improved wood fuels stoves, and of 250 higher energy-
        efficient kilns for charcoal production.

     17,000 tons of CO2 reduction achieved through the installation of 105,768
      compact fluorescent lamps and 1.1 MW of solar PV systems through the
      implementation of the Government of Senegal’s emergency rural electrification
      program including support from bilateral development agencies and through the
      small-scale concession (ERIL) financed by KFW/GIZ.

59.     Expected outcome: Further CO2 emissions reduction is expected. ASER and the
Community Development Carbon Fund, managed by the World Bank’s Carbon Finance
unit, have signed Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreements for a maximum of 175,000
certified emissions reductions (by 2018) that will happened through the installation and
use of compact fluorescent lamps under the World Bank-financed rural concessions. The
CDM Program of Activities (PoA) relative to the energy efficiency component of the
rural electrification program was registered in January 2013 by the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Overall project’s efficacy
60.     Based on the above analysis the achievement of PDO and GEO is moderately
satisfactory. The table below summarizes the analysis.

3.3 Efficiency

61.     A re-evaluation of the cost-benefit analysis, using the appraisal methodology,
revealed substantial project efficiency. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR)
increased to 16.08 percent from the appraisal rate of 13.4 percent. The higher rate is due
to substantial increase in project benefits, which offsets the increase in economic costs.
The benefits for the users have more than doubled because the number of connected users
will triple over the concession period (25 years) with concessionaires committing to
107,799 connections against an appraisal target of 35,000 connections. Also, the
environmental benefits have surged as the amount of CO2 emissions reduction increased
75 times, though the current carbon price has declined (about US$2/tCO2 against
US$4.5/tCO2 at appraisal). In contrast, the construction cost of 1 km of transmission and

                                             19
distribution line has doubled and more financing was received from co-financiers, leading
to a 223 percent increase in the total economic costs. Nonetheless, the increase in
economic benefits from both the users and the environment significantly surpasses the
increase in economic costs—present value of net benefits estimated at US$40.50
million—resulting to a high EIRR. Annex 3 provides more details on the re-evaluation of
the cost-benefit analysis.

62.     Concessions remained financially viable despite construction cost increase. A
financial analysis was conducted to assess the viability of the concession from the
concessionaire’s perspective. The analysis used the same Excel-based software that
performed the financial analysis of three WB-financed concessions at the project
appraisal. It was limited to the first Bank-financed concession, in which network
construction is well advanced and data on construction costs and expected revenues are
available. The electricity tariff used for the analysis is lower (the one approved in 2008)
as CRSE is studying a tariffs increase to reflect higher costs. The analysis revealed that
the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is lower than that at appraisal but remains
higher than the discount rate. . The financial internal rate is 12.22 percent, far below the
PAD’s FIRR of 25.46 percent for the three expected concessions, and slightly below the
concessionaire’s initial FIRR of 15.84 percent in 2008 when bid proposals were
submitted. The FIRR remained, however, higher than the discount rate (12 percent). The
FIRR decrease is mainly due to the dramatic increase of electricity network construction
costs, with the cost of 1 km of transmission and distribution line almost doubling over the
project implementation period. The FIRR is expected to be higher as CRSE is
considering a tariff increase to reflect the cost increase.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63.      The combination of high relevance, moderately satisfactory achievement of
objectives, and substantial efficiency leads to an overall moderately satisfactory outcome
rating. Such rating is higher than that of the July 2010 QALP for the following reasons.
First, the QALP did not incorporate the PROGEDE transition component’s achievements,
which ensured the environmental and social sustainability of wood fuels, including three
major reforms in the household energy sub-sector, a key part of the overall project
development objective. Second, the QALP overlooked the emissions reduction from
avoided deforestation, energy-efficient production of charcoal, and use of improve wood
stoves, which contributed to meeting the Global environment objective highly
satisfactorily. Third, the assessment did not account for electricity connections realized
through Bank financing in-house wiring in support of the government-funded emergency
rural electrification program. Fourth, network construction has expanded after the 2010
QALP and ERILs supported by KFW/GIZ provided electricity to 1,503 households and
productive users by project closure.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts



                                            20
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

64.     Poverty impacts: The project contributed to reduce rural poverty through
increased income and local job creation. As mentioned under the PDO analysis, the
PROGEDE component-supported community-based forest management and income-
generating activities enabled inhabitants in the 465 participating villages to earn
additional income estimated at US$14.6 million per year, which significantly contributes
to reduce poverty. In addition, rural electrification interventions have created and will
create local jobs. ONE has already recruited 12 Senegalese staff at St-Louis, a city in its
concession area, and envisions hiring 29 more in other cities. Other jobs will be indirectly
created with ONE’s plan to hire local contractors/companies to execute in -house wiring,
collect bills, and provide after-sales services for SHS customers. Similarly, as other
concessionaires roll out their operations, more direct and indirect jobs are expected to be
generated.

65.     Gender aspects: The project was gender-informed. The beneficiaries of the
PROGEDE transition component included women who were mostly involved in
gardening, small ruminants and improved poultry rising as part of the supported income-
generating activities. Although the monitoring arrangements for that component did not
explicitly include gender-related indicators, gender aspects were considered, as in the
previous phase. A retrospective gender analysis was later conducted to document gender
considerations. The analysis informed the design of the follow-on separate PROGEDE II
project, which explicitly included gender dimension at the development objective level.
Gender was also considered in the rural electrification components in two ways. First,
ASER included, in the M&E system, a gender-related indicator: the percentage of women
groups with productive equipment using electricity provided through the project. Second,
an assessment of gender considerations in rural electrification was conducted in 2012 and
proposed recommendations whose implementation will help mainstream gender in
ongoing activities.

66.     Social development: The project contributed positively to social development. In
the villages where community-based forest management was introduced, emigration to
Europe has declined, as youth has experienced a dramatic income increase and were able
to improve their living conditions4. The ICR mission team visited villages electrified
through the government emergency rural electrification, and villages being electrified
under WB financing (public lighting was on, under operational tests) and perceived the
impacts of rural electrification on social development: new businesses and income-
generating activities have sprung up; new health centers were constructed that provide
better quality services for longer hours; a number of schools have introduced computer-
based courses; and students have better home study conditions. Village chiefs or
representatives have strongly requested network densification and the acceleration of
household connections under the World Bank financing.

                                                 21
67.    CRSE, SENELEC, and ASER have matured over the project implementation.
CRSE has acquired expertise in developing electricity tariffs schemes for rural areas and
is now well equipped to regulate rural electrification operations. SENELEC has learned
about least cost-electrification techniques. ASER has led the awarding process of six (6)
multiple donor-funded rural electrification concessions out of ten and has completed the
required studies for two out of the remaining four (4) concessions. However, there is a
need to improve its internal organization to make the agency more efficient as it
continues to implement its program of activities.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

68.     Private investment leverage: The project leveraged significant private investments.
Concessions were awarded to international power utilities: (i) ONE, the Moroccan
national power utility, (ii) STEG, the Tunisian national power utility, (iii) EDF, France’s
power utility, and ISOFOTON, a Spain-founded global company involved in solar energy
products design, manufacturing, and supply. The concessionaires have committed, in the
concession contracts, to invest US$51.1 million, against US$11 million of investment
subsidies from the World Bank, US$4.5 million from the GoS, and US$42 million from
co-financiers (African Development Bank, European Union, KfW/GIZ, Agence
Française de Devéloppement). US$1 subsidy from the World Bank has, therefore,
leveraged US$0.4 from the GoS, US$3.8 from co-financiers, and US$4.6 from the private
sector. This level of leverage was not expected at the project design.

69.      Expertise transfer: In addition, least-cost rural electrification techniques and
know-how are being transferred in Senegal. SENELEC has adopted simplified standards
(smaller wire section, lighter electricity poles), proposed by ONE, for constructing
secondary network for which future expansions are not planned. It planned to incorporate
this technique in its network development master plan. SENELEC and ASER undertook
a study tour to Tunisia to learn more about the Single Wire Earth Return (SWER)
electrification, a safe, reliable, and less costly method for distributing electricity to
sparsely populated areas. ASER plans to adopt the method in electrifying villages
through the government-funded emergency rural electrification program. Local electricity
sector contractors are also benefiting from the private sector know-how in network
construction and in-house wiring. The transfer of know-how and least-cost electrification
techniques contributes to enhance efficiency and financial viability of rural electrification
in Senegal.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment
Outcome

Rating: Moderate

71.      A number of factors point out to a moderate risk to development and global
environment outcome. Key positive factors include: (i) currently high government
commitment to the project’s concession approach related to recognition of its importance
in achieving the target of 50% rural electrification rate by 2017, (ii) strong leadership
from the Ministry of Energy and Mines as demonstrated by recent fast processing of rural
operators requests, and (iii) continued support from multilateral and bilateral
development agencies. The moderate risk lies on ASER’s ability to improve its financial
health with expected support from the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Risks related to
tariffs are not expected as the law (98-29) requires CRSE to ensure the financial viability
of private operators, through tariff revisions to recover investment and operating costs.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
72.     Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry was moderately satisfactory. The
project’s large and small-scale concession approach was innovative and consistent with
the government’s vision, legal and policy framework. The design was based on
comprehensive background analysis involving key government agencies. Significant
efforts were deployed to look for co-financiers and coordinate their involvement.
However, the inability of government agencies to work in a synergic manner was a
considerable risk that was overlooked, and the project’s proposed implementation
timeframe did not properly reflect (i) the initial weak financial, procurement, and
technical capacities of ASER, and (ii) the innovative design features. Also, the project
preparation left some uncertainties on the coordination of financing from various donors
and how results would be attributed.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.      Quality of supervision was moderately satisfactory. Since 2007, most of the
project supervision team members-including the task team leader-were based in Senegal,
facilitating continuous support and monitoring. Financial management was regular and
diligently performed. Environmental and social safeguards skills were lacking during the
first four years but were addressed. However, project supervision leadership attention
was diverted towards urban electricity needs to address Senegal’s 2009-2011 energy
crisis that led to massive load shedding. This negatively affected pro-activity in advising
on implementation issues and timely response to requests for no-objection. QALP also

                                                   23
pointed out a lack of candor in rating development objective and implementation progress
during a certain period, and therefore rated quality of supervision as moderately
unsatisfactory in 2010. However, a change of project leadership occured in 2011, and
government counterparts have noticed closer monitoring. Project implementation also
accelerated; a number of concessions were awarded; and disbursement improved.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
74.     Because of the moderately satisfactory performance in ensuring quality at entry
and moderately satisfactory performance during supervision, Bank’s overall performance
is rated moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
75.     Performance of the government – specially the Ministry of Economy and Finance
and the Ministry of Energy and Mines – was moderately satisfactory. The Ministry of
Economy and Finance did not timely provide counterpart financing, resulting in ASER
using WB loan to pre-finance expenses that should have been incurred by counterpart
financing. At the Ministry of Energy and Mines level, project implementation had been
delayed due to the past administration’s (i) failure to set timeframes within which
involved parties—CRSE, ASER, SENELEC and ONE—have to reach compromises and
(ii) slow endorsement—about two years—of guidelines governing the delivery of ERIL
subsidies, prepared jointly by ASER and CRSE. However, the situation has changed
since 2012. The new high-level officials in place at the Ministry of Energy and Mines
have demonstrated strong leadership and succeeded in speeding up resolution of a
number of issues. Considering the recent MEM’s strong achievement and commitment,
the government performance is rated moderately satisfactory.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
76.    Implementing agencies’ performance was overall moderately satisfactory.

77.     The performance of ASER, who implemented three out of the project’s four
components, was moderately satisfactory. Although some implementation delays –
related to inputs from CRSE and SENELEC - were out of ASER’s span of control, the
agency’s execution of the government emergency program over 2008-2010, took away
human resources that may have helped speed up the rural concession implementation.

78.     In contrast, the performance of the implementing agencies for the PROGEDE
transition phase component was satisfactory. The agencies (project coordination unit,
National Water and Forest Directorate, and the Energy Directorate), who highly
successfully implemented the first phase of the PROGEDE project, were the same ones
who executed the PROGEDE transition phase component. The component activities were


                                            24
carried out as planned. An additional funding was allocated and completely disbursed by
the extended timeframe with results exceeding initial targets.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
79.    The combination of the government’s moderately satisfactory performance and
the implementing agencies’ strong moderately satisfactory performance leads to overall
borrower’s moderately satisfactory performance.

6. Lessons Learned

80.      Leveraging private sector investments for rural electrification is possible if the
legal and regulatory framework includes certain incentives. Among the factors that drove
interest from international power utilities are fiscal incentives and legal insurance
included in the 1998 Electricity Law (98-29) and the investment code. The law
emphasizes CRSE’s mandate to regulate in a manner to protect consumer’s rights, while
ensuring the financial viability of private operators, and proposes factors to be considered
in determining private operators’ financial internal rate of return. The investment code
and the agreement signed between ASER and the Ministry of Finance provide private
operators with valued added tax cuts, duty free imports of selected new network
equipment, and legal provisions to repatriate benefits and certain assets. Such legal,
fiscal, and regulatory incentives have been critical to attracting international power
utilities to invest in rural electrification in Senegal.

81.     Implementation of projects with innovative features takes time which should be
properly accounted for at the design stage. Given the novelty of the approach for the
involved government stakeholders, the lack of a number of sample documents –
particularly in the regulation aspects – the initial weak capacity of the main implementing
agency, setting an implementation timeframe of four years, similar to that of repeater
projects, was over ambitious and unrealistic. A longer implementation timeframe should
have been provided to account for the high learning curve and potential implementation
challenges.

82.     Flexibility or pragmatism is needed in certain contexts to achieve results. The
World Bank has required the approval of the regulatory framework governing the
provision of subsidies for ERILs projects (village electrification projects initiated by
community-based organizations or local private operators), prior to allowing the
procurement of ERIL projects. With delays in approving the ERIL regulatory framework,
only 131 electricity connections were achieved through the WB-supported ERIL
approach. In contrast, KfW/GIZ allowed the procurement of ERILs to go through even
though the regulatory framework was unclear. By project closing date, KFW/GIZ-
supported ERIL project realized 1,503 electricity connections, though the electricity
tariffs were later defined in collaboration with CRSE. The difference between the WB’s
approach and that of KFW/GIZ highlights the necessity of flexibility in a certain context
in order to achieve results in limited timeframe.

                                            25
83.     Having a permanent dialogue/consultation platform is critical in accelerating the
implementation of projects with multiple involved stakeholders. The project involved a
relatively high number of stakeholders: ASER, CRSE, MEM, MEF, SENELEC, WB,
AfDB, KfW/GIZ, AFD, and EU. Addressing implementation issues through exchanges
of official correspondence turned was inefficient as compared with bringing together all
involved stakeholders around the same table for discussion. Recognizing the positive
impacts of such form of exchange, the MEM is institutionalizing it by setting up a
permanent consultation platform. This experience highlights the importance of a physical
consultation platform, especially for projects involving multiple stakeholders and
implemented by an agency that is not a ring-fenced, coordination unit.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

84.     ASER, the implementing agency for the rural electrification components, sent
comments on the ICR. ASER’s comments consisted of (i) edits that were incorporated in
the present report and (ii) a proposal for a new rural electrification project.

85.    To consolidate and scale up gains realized with the WB financing, the GoS invites
its multilateral and bilateral development agencies – including the World Bank - to
support a new rural electrification project. The new project will build on the large and
small-scale concession approach designed with WB financing. It will continue the
implementation of the six awarded concessions as well as launch and implement the
remaining four concessions without current financing. Other activities that could be
financed under the new project include:

      Scaling up the implementation of ERILs
      Implementing more PREMs, which is critical to reducing poverty and
       contributing to economic and social development in rural areas
      Densifying electricity networks within concessions to increase electricity access
      Providing ASER with technical assistance to implementing the project. Such
       assistance should include logistics and staff support, which was insufficient in the
       Bank-financed project, but impacts performance.

(b) Cofinanciers

86.     KFW/GIZ provided written comments that were incorporated. KFW/GIZ
indicated that the number of household connections achieved through its financed ERIL
sub-project (known as ERSEN 1) has reached 3,500 connections by April 2013, with the
network covering 150 villages. This was included in the Annex 2—project outputs by
component—of the ICR.

87.     In addition to KFW/GIZ’s written comments, both KFW/GIZ and AFD shared
their views on the project during the ICR mission held in April 2013. They reiterated

                                           26
their support to the project and highlighted that the project achievements are significant
given its innovative nature and the initial weak capacity of ASER and CRSE. They also
mentioned the need for ASER to improve its financial situation and organizational
efficiency. In this regard, the World Bank and the co-financiers agreed to follow up very
closely the implementation of the ESMAP SE4ALL Technical Assistance for Senegal, in
which ASER strengthening and financial restructuring will be addressed.

  Annex 2. Outputs by Component

  Component 1: Financing of investments
  The component provided output-based investment subsidies to private operators, who
  were awarded large and small scale concessions for electrification. It also financed in-
  house wiring to connect households to electricity network constructed under the
  emergency rural electrification program, funded by the GoS. The emergency program
  complemented the Bank-financed project as connections realized under the emergency
  program will be transferred to concessionaires. The table below presents the component’s
  outputs.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

At appraisal, the project’s efficiency was examined by analyzing costs and benefits of the
entire rural electrification program (the project and two additional phases). Fewer data
were provided for the cost-benefit analysis of the program’s first phase (the project). The
first phase (the project)’s benefits for the users were significantly underestimated.
Excluded benefits include:
      Benefits from productive and social users of electricity
      Benefits from rural communities in charge of forest management under the
        PROGEDE transition component. Rural communities have earned US$14.6
        million per year.
      Benefits from urban and peri-urban households who acquired 205,728 higher
        energy-efficient biomass stoves, resulting to savings in household energy
        expenditures.

The cost-analysis of the project was revisited following the methodology used at
appraisal:
    Economic benefits consist of the benefits for the users and the global
       environmental benefits. The benefits for the users are estimated using the gross
       consumer surplus method, which evaluates incremental benefits resulting from
       lighting and use of TV/audio based on willingness to pay. Given the lack of recent
       data on willingness to pay, the same level of benefits per user was assumed.
    Economic costs comprise (i) investments from both financiers (Bank and other
       donors) and private operators, (ii) operation and maintenance (O&M) costs from
       private operators, and (iii) costs for capacity building, communication, and
       technical assistance provided under the project components 2 and 3.
    Global environmental benefits are estimated using a reduced carbon price of
       US$2/tCO2 to account for the current decline of the carbon market. The carbon
       price used at appraisal was US$4.5/tCO2.
    The economic analysis is done over 25 years, the duration of a concession
       contract.

Based on the appraisal methodology, the re-evaluation of the project costs and benefits
revealed an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 16.08 percent, higher than the
appraisal rate of 13.4 percent. The higher rate is due to the following factors (see table
below):
     Economic costs have doubled. The cost increase comes from investments from
       private operators. ONE, who was awarded two concession areas, and whose
       network construction is the most advanced, has documented that the cost of 1 km
       of transmission and distribution line has almost doubled. Other concessionaires
       are expected to also face construction cost increases. In addition to the
       construction cost increase, more financing than that considered at appraisal was
       provided (financing from AFD and European Union). Because of the construction

                                            33
       cost increase and the increased financing, the actual economic costs of the project
       have increased by 223 percent.

      Economic benefits for the users have more than doubled. Concessionaires
       committed to achieve 107,799 connections—the triple of the appraisal target of
       35,000 connections—over the next 25 years. Although the benefits will be
       realized later than expected at appraisal, the present value of economic benefits
       for the users have increased by 250 percent within the concession timeframe.

      Environmental benefits have surged. Though the carbon price decreased, the
       reduced CO2 emissions (604,045 tons) are 75 times more than the amount
       targeted at appraisal (8,000 tons). Hence, the environmental benefits have
       increased 33.5 fold.

      Increase in the total economic benefits (benefits for the users and environment
       benefits) exceeds the increase in the economic costs, leading to a higher NPV of
       net benefits.

A financial analysis was conducted for one concession to assess the financial viability
from the concessionaire perspective, using the same Excel-based software that performed
the financial analysis of three WB-financed concessions at the project appraisal. The
costs and expected revenues used for the analysis were received from ONE, the
concessionaire of the first Bank-financed concession. However, the electricity tariff used
(2008 tariff) is lower as CRSE is studying a tariff increase to reflect higher costs. The
analysis resulted in a financial internal rate of 12.22 percent, far below the PAD’s FIRR
of 25.46 percent for the three expected concessions, and slightly below the
concessionaire’s initial FIRR of 15.84 percent in 2008 when bid proposal was submitted.
The FIRR remained, however, higher than the discount rate (12 percent). The decrease is
mainly due to the dramatic increase of electricity network construction costs, with the
cost of 1 km of transmission and distribution line almost doubling over the project
implementation period. The FIRR is expected to be higher as CRSE is considering a tariff
increase to reflect the costs increase.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR
ASER, the agency that implemented the rural electrification components of the project,
submitted an Implementation Completion Report. The report covers the project activities
in both rural electrification and household cooking energy. The report sets the project
context, presents outputs and impacts in each component, re-assesses the project risks,
reviews the project financing and disbursements, evaluates the performance of the Bank
and the borrower, draws areas for improvement, and makes the case for a follow-up rural
electrification project. The paragraphs below highlights some key points of the borrower
ICR.

The project was designed based on the framework set by the 98-24 Electricity Law,
which created ASER and defined its operating approach—large and small-scale
concessions and support to productive uses of electricity. It was prepared as the first of a
three-phase program. The project objective is to increase access of Senegal's rural
population to modern energy services and to ensure the environmental and social
sustainability of wood fuels in urban and peri-urban areas. The objective was to be
reached through the implementation of four components of which three focused on rural
electrification. On the rural electrification area, the objective target was to reach 35,000
connections with contribution from all donors and the Government of Senegal.

The project led to a number of outputs that are consistent with those described in the
Bank ICR. The implementation of the investments component led to the award of 6
concessions—out of 10 concessions—to internationally-known private operators who
committed to providing electricity to 107,799 households and productive users over the
concession period. The awarded concessions are at different implementation stages with
two concessions at advanced construction stage. Besides the awarded large-scale
concessions, a number of small-scale concessions (ERILs) were implemented, including
(i) KFW/GIZ-financed ERSEN 1 and 2 projects, and (ii) the joint World
Bank/Netherlands cooperation ERIL. The KFW/GIZ-financed ERSEN 1 led to 1,503
household connections by project closure and to 3,500 connections by April 2013.

The performance of the Bank and the borrower is mixed. Overall, the World Bank played
a key technical and financial role. The Bank supervision team supported the
implementing agencies and the government and extended the project closing date at the
request of the Government. However, some shortcomings were noticed: (i) slow approval
of requests for no-objection to award two concessions (Mbour and Kolda-Velingara) and
ERIL sub-projects, (ii) slow approval of disbursement requests, and (iii) lack of
flexibility in the selection of the concessionaire for the Kolda-Velingara concession,
leading to the cancellation of the allotted investment subsidy. On the borrower side,
ASER faced a number of barriers that affected its performance. This was mainly due to
the innovative nature of the project and the lack of readiness of the institutional
framework.

Analyzing the project implementation experience, a number of areas for improvement
were found. Key improvement areas include the following:

                                            40
      ASER’s rural electrification approach: there is a need to re-focus ASER
       interventions only on the large-scale concessions and small-scale concessions
       (ERIL).
      Concession award and effectiveness timeframe: To accelerate the concession
       award and effectiveness timeframe, the following can be done: (i) eliminate the
       prequalification step, (ii) reduce the timeframe for evaluating the bids, (iii) set
       deadlines for approvals, and (iv) enhance collaboration between intervening
       stakeholders.
      Bank’s financing areas: Bank financing allotted for ASER operations and logistic
       equipment was insufficient. In addition, staff salaries were not covered by Bank
       financing. This affected project implementation and should be taken into account
       if there is a follow up project.

A follow-up Bank-financed project would be relevant. The project has led to significant
regulatory, institutional, and private sector involvement gains. ASER has acquired
tremendous experience and learned from the implementation challenges. In addition, the
government is strongly committed to increasing rural electrification. Based on these
factors, the government invites its development partners to support a follow-up rural
electrification project. The follow-up project will build on the large and small-scale
concession approach designed with WB financing. It will continue the implementation of
the six awarded concessions as well as launch and implement the remaining four
concessions without current financing. Other activities that could be financed under the
new project include:

      Scaling up the implementation of ERILs
      Implementing more PREMs, which is critical to reducing poverty and
       contributing to economic and social development in rural areas
      Densifying electricity networks within concessions to increase electricity access
      Providing ASER with technical assistance to implementing the project. Such
       assistance should include logistics and staff support, which was insufficient in the
       Bank-financed project, but impacts performance

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

KFW/GIZ provided written comments that were incorporated. KFW/GIZ indicated that
the number of household connections achieved through its financed ERIL sub-project
(known as ERSEN 1) has reached 3,500 connections by April 2013, with the network
covering 150 villages. This was included in the Annex 2—project outputs by
component—of the ICR.

In addition to KFW/GIZ’s written comments, both KFW/GIZ and AFD shared their
views on the project during the ICR mission held in April 2013. Below are some key
take-away views:

      Both KFW/GIZ and AFD strongly support the project and continue to monitor
       closely project implementation progress. KFW/GIZ financed the ERSEN 1 ERIL
       and is scaling up its support with the financing of ERSEN 2, which aims to
       electrify 201 villages. Besides the ERILs, KFW/GIZ financed one large-scale
       concession (Kaolack-Nioro-Factick-Gossas) that was awarded. AFD financed one
       concession (Kafrinne-Tambacounda-Kedougou) that was awarded to EDF.

      Both co-financiers highlighted that the project is innovative and constitutes a
       learning-by-doing experience for all involved stakeholders, including ASER,
       CRSE, and the World Bank.

      KFW/GIZ indicated that given the innovative nature of the project and the initial
       lack of capacity, the project achievements are significant.

      Both co-financiers look forward to ASER improving its financial situation and
       organizational efficiency.
