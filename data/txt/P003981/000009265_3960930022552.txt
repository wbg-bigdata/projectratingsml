MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PPRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTON AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESiA
FOR A PROVINCIAL IRRIGATED AGRICUTRME DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.   The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of
Indonesia for US$ 125.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed Bank loan
would be for 20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate
and would help finance a Provincial Irrigated Agriculture Development Project.
2.    Background. Agriculture remains the key sector of the Indonesian economy, contributing
about 21 percent of GDP, providing employment to some 55 percent of the labor force and
generating about 56 percent of non-oil exports. Food crops constitute the largest subsector,
contributing 52 percent of agricultural GDP. Rice, the staple food and dominant crop in Indonesia
accounts for about 30 percent of agricultual GIDP and was the most important crop in sector
growth. Trhe large expansion of irrigation infrastructure in Indonesia over the last two decades has
made a major contribution to Indonesia's self-sufficiency in tice. Irrigated rice has been most
successful in Java and Bali, withi a long established tradition of irrigated agriculture, but has not
been matched by a similar performance on the Outer Islands (Sumatra, Sulawesi and Kalimantan).
The construction program has not been accompanied by a coordinated effort to deliver the full
benefits from irrigated agricultural development. The subsector is thus facing some major
challenges which fall into four broad categories - technical, institutional, financial and
environmental. These include requirements to: (a) improve quality control; (b) give more priority
for non-construction and O&M activities; (c) address institutional and human resource constraints;
(d) coor'"nate irrigation programs and agriculture services; (e) improve the monitoring and
evaluatiorx of irrigation perfomance and the impact of irigation on agriculturai production;
(f) improve cost recovery mechanisms and provide adequate counterpart funding; (g) increase
beneficiary participation; and (h) give more consideration to environmental impact of schemes.
3 .   These shortcomings are interdependent and have emnieged as major chaUerges folowing the
major and rapid expansion of infrastructure over the last decade. They have remained unchecked
until recendy because priority has been placed on expanding the irrigation infrastucture, without
confining that the investment programs are generating benefits through increased irrigated
agricultural production. Government has recognized these challenges and issued a policy statement
for the Irrigaton Subsector in 1987 which defined its policy objectives, established new policies
and formulated an action program on subsector-wide O&M funding, institutional strngthening and
cost recovery. More receny, in response to experience under past projects, Government has
increasingly focused on completion and intensified irrigated agricultural development of ongoing
schemes, particularly in the OuterIslands.
4.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's support would be an important
encouragement to Government in the implementation of its sound and well-defined strategy for the
sub-sector. This strategy sets priorities to: (a) upgrade existing irrigation projects so that
deficiencies in design and construction can be remedied and systems can perform as designed;
(b) introduce O&M practices so that irrigation systems can be sustained; (c) provide adequate O&M
funding through provincial allocations and cost recovery from beneficiaries; (d) complete viable
high-priority projects, limidting new projects to those necessary to achieve overall Govemment
objectives, such as food self-sufficiency, balanced regional growth, and crop diversification; (e)
turn over small public irrigation systems to Water Users' Associations (WUAs); and (f) integrate
development to achieve full realization of potential agricultural benefits with focus on land and
agricultural development, settlement aspects and land certification.
5.   As an essential part of the above strategy, the project would focus on the serious gap in
irrigation development on the Outer Islands to date, namely completion of schemes and obtaining
benefits from irrigated agriculture. This phase is an essential prerequisite to the introduction of
efficient O&M (EOM) and related policies of cost recovery, and the turnover of small public
schemes to WUAs, being supported under the ongoing Irrigation Subsector Project (ISSP, Ln.
2880-IND). Thus, the project is an integral part of Bank irrigation subsector strategy in Indonesia.



- 2-
With Bank encouragement and support, Government is likely to give more priority under the project
to sensitive issues such as: inter-agency coordination; the budgetary process; preparation for O&M
until schemes are fully completed and handed over to the provinces; and procedures to test and
certify that schemes are fully operational. This would be in tandem with Bank's support under
parallel operations to address operations and maintenance policy and other institutional reforms.
6.      oject Obiective. The main project objective is to achieve potential benefits from inigated
agricultural development by completing and fully developing ongoing small- and medium-scale
irrigation schemes in 13 provinces on the Outer Islands of Indonesia. Ongoing schemes are those
where the diversion structure and the main distribution system have been completed, but which are
not ready for hand over for efficient operation and maintenance (EOM). A related objecive is to
assist in the development of institutional capacity to enable improved coordination of irrigation with
agriculture and other related activities.
7. .t Desri. The project would comprise: (a) survey, investigations and design; (b)
completion of irrigation works on some 130 schemes serving about 273,000 ha, including
construction of minor canal and drainage systems and preparation for operation and maintenance
(PROM); (c) land clearance and development of about 40,000 ha; (d) agricultural development
acdtvies including seed multiplication programs, trials for problem soils and training of farmer
groups; (e) land titling and certification; (f) environmental protection including forest surveys and
erosion control; (g) settlement of about 1400 families; and (h) coordination and management of
irrigated agricultual development. The project, to be implemented over five years, would provide
funds for civil works, services, equipment, and limited technical assistance. The project is
estimated to cost US$ 215.4 million, including US$ 13.3 million in taxes and duties and US$ 2.7
million in reserve procurement of whicles. The proposed Bank loan of US$ 125.0 million
equivalent will finance about 62.5 percent of financing requirements exclusive of taxes and duties
and reserve procurement of vehicles. Retroacdve financing for up to US$ 2.5 million will be
provided foreligible expenditures aftrAugust 1, 1990. This will enable the project momentum
gained durng preparation to be maintained. A breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. The amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The maps of the
project area are attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9137 dated February 19, 1991, is being
distdibuted separately.
8.    Agre Action. The Govenmment has agreed to the following acdons:
(a) screen, select and commission project schemes in accordance wiffi agreed procedures
and crteria;
(b) undertake project coordination at national and prvincial levels, assisted by consultants
to be retained under agreed terms of referenceby August 15, 1991;
(c) undertake environmental assessments on project schemes and classify catchment areas
of schemes as Protection Forests;
(d) submit for review for each province a coordinated work proguam and cost esdmates no
later than June 30 of each year and coordinated budget proposals for the agreed
provincial work programs by September 30 of each year,
(e)  complete and develop each scheme as defined and agreed under the project before any
additional moderization or expansion to the scheme command area is undetkn; and
(f)  certify and verfy that schemes are complete and can fimcdon effectively before they
are handed over to O&M authorities.



- 3 -
9.     In addition, conditions of disbursement would be: (a) for schemes other than those to be
implemented in the first year, prior approval by the Bank of the scheme design, scope and estimated
costs; (b) for each project provincial program, excluding the survey, investigation and design
component, prior approval by the Bank of the annual budget provisions for project implementation;
and (c) for the irrigation works component in each province, for each fiscal year, an annual budget
provision for O&M satisfactory to the Bank and evidence of satisfactory O&M in the previous year.
10.  Bnefis. The primary benefits of the project would be increased agricultural production,
primarily of rice. The main beneficiaries would be farmers with land within the design command
area of schemes, but which has yet to be fully developed and served by irrigation. Farmers
presently receiving some irrigation would also benefit with the introduction of more timely and
reliable irrigation supply. Major quantifiable benefits at full development would be an incremental
annual production of about t,100,000 tons of paddy. About 127,000 rural families would benefit
directly from the new areas brought under irrigation with improved incomes for an additional
100,00 families presently receiving an irnigation service. The project would settle some
1400 families on schemes in Sulawesi and Kalimantan. An equivalent of 90,000 full-time farm
jobs are expected to be created as a resultofcrop intensificaon. Since project schemes are located
throughout the provinces involved, the project is expected to resut in significant indirect benefits in
more isolated regions of Indonesia. Te project would generate important socio-economic benefits
and alleviate poverty since many beneficiaries are exisdng trnigrants or local settlers. The
project would also generate additional labor demand in isolated areas for on-farm activities as well
as from project implementation activities, mainly benefitfing the landless. In addition, benefits
would accrue from the improved perfonnance and sustainability of irrigation schemes and through
beter coordination and improved management of irigated agriculture by national and provincial
agencies.
11.  Risks. Institutional risks include the need to substantially improve organizatonal and
management arrangements and also include addressing the challenges of inadequate staffing,
reliance on technical assistance and unpredictable funding. These risks are expected to be
minimized by the strengthening of coordination and management arrangements and procedures, and
inclusion of conditionalities linked to coordinated work programs. In this respect, the multi-agency
approach under the project, with a direct financial interest for all agencies involved in irrigated
agdcultural development, would increase public accountability for poor performance. Annual
project reviews would provide opportunities to identify and conrct potential risks in a imely
manner. Technical risks, such as inadequate collection of physical resource data, the quality of
planning and design and lack of scheme completion, would also be addressed through the need to
comply with detailed crteria that focus on quality control and which would be monitored through
review of annual work programs. Environmental risks are small since most project schemes are
substantially complete and parts of the command areas have been under irrigation for many years.
Completion and full development of schemes are not expected to produce a significant change in
environmental conditions. However, some schemes are located in remote parts of the Outer Islands
and surrounded by environmentally sensitive areas. The project would therefore include a specific
environmental protection component under the Ministry of Forestry so that there would be an
agency evaluating environmental impact that is independent of the agencies with responsibility for
the main works programs.
12.  Recommendatio. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Ardcles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
