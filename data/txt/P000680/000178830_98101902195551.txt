REPORT AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPENT CREDIT
TO THE EMPIRE OF ETHIOPIA
FOR A
SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOP?ENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Empire of Ethiopia for the equivalent of US$5.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a second livestock develop-
ment project in athiopia.J1
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report "Current Position and Prospects of the Ethiopian
Economy" (AE-21) was circulated on November 18, 1971. The report of a recent
economic mission is nearing completion. A Country Data Sheet is attached as
Annex I.
3.        Virtually isolated from modern science and technology until the
middle of the twentieth century, Ethiopia is one of the least developed of
all countries. The per capita income is $76 a year and some 85% of the pop-
ulation of 25 million are peasant farmers. Agriculture accounts for about
90% of employment, 58% of GDP, and almost all exports. Manufacture contri-
butes only around 5% of GDP.
4.        During the last two decades the Governnent has made notable efforts
to accelerate the pace of development. Ethiopia is now in its Third Five-
Year Plan. The first two plans gave priority to the development of infra-
structure such as roads, telecommunications and power, and the establishment
of manufacturing industries (mainly government-financed) based on import sub-
stitution. The third plan emphasizes the development of agriculture and of
activities such as training and feeder road building which directly support
agricultural development. However, progress has been slow. Institutions
are changing only gradually, and the slow pace of change has inhibited rapid
growth. At the same time Ethiopia has had a relatively low and somewhat
intermittent capital inflow. Coffee is the principal source of foreign
exchange and the world demand for coffee increases only slowly. Moreover,
export prices fluctuate, leading to large swings in export income. Tith
respect to aid, Ethiopia, unlike many other African countries which were for-
merly dependent, has had no traditional source of technical and financial
assistance.
5.        Over the past decade, per capita GDP has grown at about 2%.
Growth would have been lower but for a 16% annual rate of growth of the manu-
facturing sector based on import substitution. The economy was particularly
sluggish during the late 1960's. There was a sharp upturn in the economy for
about a year beginning in mid 1969 due to high coffee prices, but the economy
/1 The financial plan for this project, including the cost estimates and the
contributions by IDA and the Government, have been based on the currency
values prevailing before the recent devaluation of the US dollar. The
project costs in terms of US dollars are now expected to increase and for
that reason the amount of the IDA credit now recommended is $5.0 million
rather than the $4.5 million given in the remainder of this report and the
appraisal report.



has been slowing down again since mid 1970 and has been sluggish during the
past year or so. Export earnings increased at under 3% in 1970 and in 1971
and, at the end of 1971, external reserves were at an all-time year-end low
of about three months' imports. Partly due to the slow rate of economic
growth during most of the late 1960's and partly because the opportunities
for further import substitution are limited, the growth of manufacturing was
less rapid than before and the inflow of private capital declined. As a
result of these developments the pace of investment and growth was below the
planned targets. Also, while total population grew at 2.5% a year, the
urban population rose at 7% a year and the problem of urban unemployment and
the need for systematic urban planning became evident.
6.        In preparation for the inaugural meeting of the Consultative Group
for Ethiopia in May 1971, the Ethiopian Government reviewed the progress of
the Third Five-Year Plan. In general the Government reaffirmed the main
strategy and policies of the Plan, which were to give priority to the devel-
opement of agriculture and allied activities. However, within the overall
strategy there was some shift in emphasis towards the development of peasant
agriculture in order to realize the Plan's four objectives of broadening the
monetization of the econony, expanding employment in the rural areas,
achieving a more favorable income distribution, and increasing supplies of
domestic food crops. The revised strategy also recognized the need to
increase and diversify exports and to diversify the overall economy
through the development of tourism, manufacturing and mining. In the expec-
tation of an increase in coffee prices based on the incipient price recovery
in 1969, new investment and growth targets were fixed and the development
plan period was extended for a sixth year to July 1974. Unfortunately coffee
trices declined again in late 1970 and although they have risen again since
mid-July 1972, future prices are uncertain and the new investment and growth
targets for the remainder of the extended plan are not expected to be
realized.
7.        TrLning to the longer term future, there is danger that the economic
growth rate may decline to below the population growth rate during the next
fifteen years, unless the rate of growth of non-coffee exports and of total
export earnings is significantly raised, the capacity to increase domestic
resources more fully exploited, investment substantially increased, and absorp-
tive capacity i$proved. Export possibilities other than coffee include live-
stock, fresh fruit and vegetables, pulses, and oil seeds.   Increasing exports
depends in pa rt on providing the appr-opriate price and income incentivesto pro-
ducers and marketing intermediaries, and in part on programs of improvement of
facilities and techniques such as are provided by the project proposed here.
8,        A Bank mission visited Ethiopia to make a comprehensive study of the
agricultural sector and has concluded that the problem of Ethiopian agriculture
is basically one of supply, marketing, and processing, rather than demand.
Livestock has the best export growth potential. The countryts production poten-
tial and the international markets for its non-coffee exports are regarded as
favorable. However, the development of this productive potential is constrained
by inadequate infrastructure, shortage of credit facilities, shortage of skilled
manpower, and land tenure systems. The Government is aware of these constraints
and is taking some steps to deal with them. For example, the Agricultural and
Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) has been established, and legislation for
tenancy reform has been submitted to Parliament.

9.        Both import and export have been affected by two major events in
the past six years. The closure of the Suez Canal raised freight charges
and costs and adversely affected the domestic prices of both imports and
exports. More recently the Government decided to maintain the parity of
the Ethiopian dollar with gold while the USA, its largest export customer,
and some competitors and prospective competitors such as Argentina, devalued
their currencies. The decision has changed the relative prices of imports
and exports in the opposite direction to that needed to discourage imports
and encourage export production.
10.       The Economic Mission examined alternative ways of changing the
effective price of foreign exchange. These included quantitative control of
imports, generalized import surcharges and export subsidies, selective pro-
tective tariffs and export subsidies, and adjustment of the exchange parity.
It is the mission's view that unless one or more of the above measures are
taken, other policy and institutional changes required to promote the
economic development of Ethiopia are liable to be frustrated.
11.       The Bank is taking a number of steps to support the Governmient's
general development effort. The Agricultural Sector Mission has been
referred to in paragraph 8. The Ethiopian Government, with IDA assistance,
has just completed a review of the education sector to enable it to design a
strategy, policies and curricula which will produce the trained manpower
needed for Ethiopia's development. The Bank is executing agency for a UNDP-
financed study of internal air transport with special regard to tourism
development, and for a UNDP project which is providing a team of experts to
help the Government in improving its planning.
12.       Three main difficulties confront Ethiopia - inadequate domestic
resources, a prospective foreign exchange constraint, and an absorptive
capacity problem. A large part of Ethiopia's investment, public and private
will need to be financed externally; since public savings are likely to
fall short of needs, some part of the domestic cost of public investment
will have to be financed from external resources. Simce the outlook for the
balance of payments is not favorable, the needed capital should be imported
to the greatest extent possible on concessionary terms.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ETHIOPIA
13.       Since 1950 when Ethiopia was the recipient of the Bank's first
loan in Africa, Ethiopia has received twelve Bark loans totalling US$108.6
miLllion and ten DA credits amounting to US$83.2 million.   Four loans are
fully repaid and four others are fully disbursecd. Since 1965, IFC has made
four commitments in Ethiopia totalling US$14.1 million.   Annex I contains a
summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and of IFC investments as of
January 31, 1973 and notes on the execution of on-going Bank-IDA projects.
14.       Until 1969, the lending program concentrated primarily on assist-
ing the construction of Ethiopia's infrastructure of roads, power and tele-
communications. Aside from some small amounts for agriculture provided under
loans to the Development Bank of Ethiopia, the Bank Group's first lending for
agriculture in Ethiopia was the credit for the Wolamo Project in 1969. Since
that time four additional credits have been made for agricultural projects -
one to support mechanized cormercial farming at Humera in Northwest Ethiopia,
one for dairy development in the Addis Ababa area and one for coffee pro-
cessing - and one for the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB),
which was partly for agricultural credit and partly to finance industrial
development. In addition credits have been made for an education project and
a highway project with emphasis on feeder roads, and a loan for a water
supply and sewerage project. This shift in the lending program reflects the
Bank Group's new emphasis on agriculture., the increased opportunity for agri-
cultural lending brought about in part by improved sectoral knowledge, and
the heavier emphasis on agriculture in the government's own priorities. This
shift has been greatly assisted by the Bank's Permanent Mission in Eastern
Africa (PW.A), which has had a major role in project identification and pre-
paration in the agriculture sector. 7Xhile the need to finance infraptructure
will continue, the main emphasis of the Bank Group's future lending will be
placed on agriculture and education, and supporting activities in manpower
development, marketing, creditgand transportation.
15.       Daring the next twelve months I expect to present for your approval
loans or credits for two morn agricultural projects, as well as projects in
the fields of education, teleconmunications, aviation and tourism.   One of
the agricultural projects wi:Ll be irrigated farming and the other
would provide a large number of agricultural families with their minimum
needs for extension services tied to credit for basic inputs of fertilizer,
improved seeds, and simple farm implements.   This project will be part of the
Governrent's innovative "MinixmLnr. Package Program" based largely on the experi-
ence of a SIDA pilot program in Ethiopia.   The Minimum Package Program is a
new departure aimed at peasant agriculture which is now receiving increasing
attention and support from the Government. The aviation project would empha-
size internal airports required for tourism development, and the telecommu-
nications lending would help finance the next phase of the country's continu-
ing teleccmrunications development program.   Other projects under preparation
and consideration for Fiscal Year 1974 are three agricultural projects,
one livestock project, furth(er financing for the Agricultural and Industrial
Development Bank (AIDB) and an education project to assist the Government to
iM-lement its decisions on educational reform.



16.       A summary of recent external assistance to Ethiopia by source and
by sectors can be seen at Annex II.  During 1967-71 the Bank and IDA contri-
buted 36% of gross inflows of official capital. This share is expected to
increase substantially during the next few years as amounts disbursed under
Bank loans and IDA credits rise.  Given the poverty of Ethiopia, the need
for capital and at best moderate export prospects, it is planned that as much
of future lending as possible will be in the form of IDA credits.
PART III - LIVESTOCK IN ETHIOPIA
17.       Ethiopia has probably the largest livestock population of any
country in Africa. With about 26 million cattle and 24 to 27 million sheep
and goats and with about 56% of the country's total land surface suitable
for grazing, livestock represents a major national resource to Ethiopia.
However, livestock makes a disproportionately small contribution to the nation-
al economy and export earnings.
1e.       Cattle in Ethiopia are kept as draught aniamls, to provide meat for
family consumption and for sale. They are widely distributed in small herds.
Total offtake of cattle is est:imated at about 1.7 million head per year, or
about 6.5% of the national cattle herd. Of the total offtake, about 700,000
head are consumed on the farm and about one million head enter the money
economy; of the latter, about 870,000 head are used for domestic consumption
and approximately 130,000 are exported.
19.       Sheep and goats account for much of the meat supply in rural areas.
They are produced for the market as a source of cash income, and sold as
soon as they reach a marketable weight. Camels are kept for milk and meat
in the lowlands, but their main use is as pack animals. Equines are are also
used mainly for transport, and the large population of equines and camels may
offer prospects for development of a pet food industry based on aged and
surplus animals.
20.       Neighboring countries are the principal market for Ethiopian live
animals, fresh and chilled meat and ghee (butter oil). A large part of the
live animal exports consists of unrecorded border crossings into Somalia,
compensated by reverse movements of other goods into Ethiopia. Due to close
proximity, and the commercial links of its Arab traders, Ethiopia enjoys
a competitive advantage in the Saudi Arabian peninsula for sacrificial ani-
mals and chilled meat - although Australia has begun to offer strong competi-
tion. These markets could be further developed and expanded in the inter-
mediate term through an appropriate combination of improvements in livestock
production and marketing. Although the demand for unprocessed beef and veal
in the developed countries is expected to remain strong, Ethiopian exports
to these countries are barred by health regulations.
21.       Exports of cooked and canned meat from Ethiopia have been rising
sharply under the impetus of strong demand in Western Europe, particularly in



-6-
Italy. They could increase further if larger supplies of live animals were
available to the canning factories.
22.       Hide production for 1970 has been estimated at 2.7 million of
which 1.2 million were exported. World trade in hides and skins is limited
by supplies. Exports from the developing countries grew at just over one
percent per annum during the 1960's, but trade is expected to increase con-
siderably during the 1970's as larger supplies become available. Because
of poor processing, the present quality of Ethiopia hides and skins is low.
There is scope for improvement and hence for better prices.
Government Planning in the Livestock Sector
23.       The Third Five-Year Plan recognizes the need for a carefully
conceived and realistic livestock development policy including improvements in
the marketing and processing of livestock and livestock products, and it
places emphasis on increased exports.
Constraints to Development
24.       The greatest obstacles to increased production and productivity
are:
(a) livestock diseases;
(b) lack of an organized stockroute and marketing
system;
(c)  inadequate facilities for slaughter and hides and
skin preparation; and
(d) the land tenure system.
25.       The major epidemic diseases of cattle -- rinderpest, foot-and-
mouth disease, and contagious bovine plueropneumonia -- occur in Ethiopia;
effective vaccines are available to control them but are not at present
used to any significant extent. Internal parasites, particularly liver
fluke, are serious problems in cattle, especially in the highland areas.
Diseases, combined with uneven and sometimes low levels of nutrition, lead
to extremely heavy mortalities and slow grovth rates, and exclude unprocessed
meat products from many export markets, particularly in Europe.
26.       The absence of any improved stockroutes with disease control or
suitably spaced grazing/resting areas, results in tremendous losses of
cattle as they move the long distances from production areas to main consumer
centers at Addis Ababa and Asmara.   Such losses are estimated at up to 20%
of initial body liveweight on a 20-day trek. To date, virtually no cattle
are transported by truck although a small quantity are carried on the Addis
Ababa-Dire Dawa-Djibouti Railroad, especially en-route to export markets in
the Gulf states.



- 7 -
27.       The cattle are slaughtered under primitive conditions, usually in
an open field, and are flayed without skill or suitable tools. The hides
are sun-dried and have a low value in the export market. Due to the low
quality of most of the hides almost half of the potential supply is never
marketed.
28.       Of the four main types of land tenure in Ethiopia namely, communal,
leasehold, individual owner occupier and Government land, the first two
adversely affect livestock development. Communal tenure is mainly practiced
in the northern areas of the country (Eritrea, Tigre, N. Shoa, Begemdir and
Gojjam). Land is vested in family or village groups, and its use is allotted
to individuals for cultivation. However, an individual is given no rights
over fallow or grass lands. It is impossible for him to enclose the land to
control movenent of stock, prevent spread of disease or to plant any fodder
crop. Under leasehold tenure, which applies to much of Shoa, and the prov-
inces of Southern Ethiopia, the majority of tenants lack security of tenure
and therefore have no incentive to carry out any development.
Government Services
29.       The livestock sector is characterized by a dearth of Government
services. The staff of the Veterinary Department of the Ministry of Agricul-
ture currently comprises only 58 qualified veterinarians, 36 of whom are
foreign; 200 animal health assistants with two-year diploma qualifications;
and some 450 vaccinators. The veterinary service in the field is seriously
understaffed, and its effectiveness is reduced by budgetary limitations
affecting transportation, allowances, and materials. There are no private
veterinary practitioners in the country. The Animal Production Department,
also within the Ministry of Agriculture, has little impact on stock owners
due to lack of funds and trained personnel. There is no livestock extension
service.
PART IV   - THE PROJECT
30.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Second Livestock Development
Project - Ethiopia" (PA136a dated December 4, 1972) is being circulated sep-
arately to the Executive Directors.   A Credit and Project Summary is provided
at Annex III.
Background
31.       The project was prepared by the Livestock and IMat Board (LM3) with
assistance from the staff of the Permanent Mission in Eastern Africa in the
Spring and Summer of 1971. A credit application was received by the Associ-
ation in October 1971, and a mission to Ethiopia appraised the project in
November/December 1971.
32.       Negotiations for the credit took place from July 10 to 25, 1972.
The Ethiopian delegation was led by H.E. Ato Tesfa Bushen, then Vice Minister
of Agriculture, assisted by H.E. Ato Teferra Haile Selassie, Vice Minister



- 8 -
Municipalities Departmert, Ministry of Interior, Ato Berhanu Wakwaya,
General Manager, Livestock and Meat Board, Dr. Assefa Haile Giorgis,
Director General Veterinary Service, Ministry of Agriculture and Ato Teferra
Wolde Semait, Financial and Economic Counselor, Ethiopia Embassy,
Washington, D.C.
33.       Presentation of the proposal to the Executive Directors was delayed
because of the time required in making satisfactory administrative arrange-
ments between the LMB and the municipalities within which many of the project
facilities would be located.
The Project
34.       The main objective of the project is the provision of integrated
market and stockroute systems in three important livestock producing areas,
and slaughter facilities in 159 towns and villages throughout Ethiopia.
Transportation of cattle by truck would be pioneered and preparation of private
ranching schemes assisted by the project. Funds for preparation of future
projects would also be included.
35.       The project would provide:
(a)  48 primary markets in livestock producing areas and
6 terminal markets in consumer areas;
(b) about 2,500 km of stockroutes;
(c) five cattle trucks to be operated by LMB to move
cattle from ends of the stockroutes to consumer
centers;
(d) 159 slaughter facilities with associated hide sheds;
(e)  funds for employmnt of qualified persons in senior
project positions and for training of project staff;
and
(f)  funds for the preparation of future livestock projects.
Project Description
36.       Location  The project would develop stockroutes, with associated
primary markets in the southern provinces of Arussi, Bale, and Sidamo, to
facilitate sales activities and movement of cattle from producing areas to
the main consumer centers, where terminal markets would be constructed.
Similar developments would be undertaken in the Jijiga area of the Harar
Province, to facilitate the export of sheep and goats to Somalia and the
movement of cattle to Dire Dawda, a key cattle marketing town in eastern
Ethiopia. One stockroute, with associated markets, would be developed in the
north for livestock moving from the Danekil plains towards the consumer
center at Asmara and the meat plants at Kimbolcha and Mekele.



- 9 -
37.       Stockroutes  The stockroute development included in the project
would provide fenced and watered resting points at intervals of about 25 km
along well-defined traditional routes. The majority would enclose adequate
grazing for the livestock passing through and only in a small number, in
areas of dense cultivation, would the traders have to provide feed. The
project would also establish a marshalling yard on the railway at Dire Dawa
to be used to hold livestock for export by sea from Djibuti. The yard
would provide holding pens, water, fodder storage and veterinary facilities.
To ensure that markets, stockroutes and the marshalling yard would be proper-
ly maintained, the Project would set up five mobile maintenance units.
38.       Markets   The markets developed by the project would provide centers
in which properly organized auction sales would be conducted at regular
intervals by trained marketing teams, under the direction of trained live-
stock marketing officers. A veterinary inspection service would also be
provided for the markets.
39.       Cattle trucks   Under the project, LMB would operate five cattle
trucks, each consisting of a lorry and trailer. This would be aimed at
demonstrating the profitability of such operations and encouraging private
individuals to purchase similar vehicles with credit which may become
available from AIDB and replace LNB service, which would then be moved to
other routes.
h0.       Slaughter facilities   The project would construct 159 slaughter
facilities at selected locations throughout the country.   In the municipal
areas, municipalities would provide land, and, if available, water and elec-
tricity. Pesponsibility for design, construction and operation would rest
with the LMB in all locations. Day-to-day operations at slaughter facili-
ties would be directed by small LMB staffs attached to individual facili-
ties. In addition slaughter facilities and hide shed teams would be esta-
blished which would assist the staff of indiVidual facilities in improved
techniques and in maintenance and repair and in financial matters. It was
agreed that arrangements satisfactory to the Association for training of
rembers of such teams would be made by LMB.
h1.       Technical and Administrative assistance    To strengthen LMB manage-
ment and assist execution of the project, the project would provide finan-
cing for accounting consulting services and the following officials at the
LM3 headquarters: (a) the Project Manager and his Deputy; (b) a Financial
Officer and his Deputy; (c) the Head of the Marketing and Stockroute Depart-
ment; (d) the Head of Slaughter Facilities and Hide Shed Department; (e) a
Marketing Specialist; (f) a Construction Officer and Draftsman; and (g) a
Ranching Specialist. Appointment to (c) and (d) above and to the posts of
Project Manager, Financial Officer and Construction Officer of persons
acceptable to the Association would be a condition of effectiveness of the
credit. Wherever these positions are filled by non-Ethiopians, LMB would
employ Ethiopians to serve as deputies with a view to their eventually
taking over such positions. Retroactive financing from the credit has been
proposed for expenditures incurred after July 15, 1972 in an amount not
exceeding $30,000 toward employment of six senior project officials, the
Ranching Specialist, and Accounting Consultant for LMB.



- 10 -
42.       Future Project Preparation   An amount of US$400,000 equivalent
would be included in the prcject to finance preparation of future projects.
The Government has agreed to consult with the Association with regard to
the project or projects to be prepared and to employ personnel and/or con-
sultants, acceptable to the Association, for the purpose.
43.       Related development   In consequence of the project and as a
related development, private development of fattening ranches and operation
of cattle trucks by private individuals are envisaged. It is expected that
financing for about 5 fattening ranches and purchase of 5 cattle trucks by
private parties would become available through the Agricultural and Indus-
trial Development Bank (AIDB), using funds from the IDA credit to AIDB
signed on May 10, 1972. The Ranching Specialist financed under the project
would assist ranchers in the preparation of viable projects.
Project Implementation and Managemnt
44.       The project would be implemented over a four-year period.   LMB
would be responsible for executing all aspects of the project except future
project preparation and employment of the Ranching Specialist which would be
the responsibility of the government. The wells required to be constructed
under the project would be drilled either by the Ministry of Mines or the
National 58ater Resources Commission. The Veterinary Department of the Ministry
of Agriculture would provide required veterinary staff for the project. A
large number of municipalities would be concerned with the project facilities
since some of these would be located in municipal areas. LMB has already
entered into agreements with a substantial number of municipalities which set
out the arrangements for the establishment and operation of project facili-
ties, and the government has assured that arrangements satisfactory to the
Association will be put into effect with the remaining municipalities.
45.       LMB was created by Government Order in 1963 as an independent body
to handle matters relating to livestock, poultry, meat, eggs and related
by-products - including hides and skins. It has broad powers, including the
power to construct facilities, demarcate stockroutes and watering points
and to fix and collect fees for their use. The day-to-day operations of LMB
are the responsibility of a General Manager appointed by a Board of Directors
chaired by the Minister of Agriculture. The Board members are representa-
tives of various government ministries and representatives of traders,
producers and processors.
46.       The LMB presently employs about 100 persons, but the project
would increase this to about 1,200. Although the past operations of LMB have
been satisfactory, this major expansion will create organizational and admini-
strative problems too large to be handled by the present staff.   Therefore,
the recruitment ant-3 training cf additicnal staff and the development of
LMB's management capability to handle the expanded organization are crucial
to the success of the project for which technical and administrative assist-
ance as described in paragraph 41 above would be financed under the project.



Financing Plan
L7.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$6.4 million.   The
foreign exchange component would be US$2.2 million or about 35%. The pro-
proposed credit of US$4.5 million would finance 70% of the total project cost
including the entire foreign exchange cost and US$2.3 million of local expen-
ditures. The local currency financing is justified on country grounds
(paragraph 12 above).  The government would finance $1 .5 million (23%) and
1MB $0.43 million (7%) of the project cost.
L8.       The IDA credit would be made to the government on usual terms
with governTent assuming the foreign exchange risk. Except for credit funds
for future prcject preparation (estimated at US$300,C0C0) which woulc be
directly utilized by government and foreign exchange expenditures to cover
part of the costs of hiring non-Ethiopian staff (which would be passed on to
LYB as a grant), the credit proceeds would be>onlent to LMB at 3/4 of 1% for
the first 5 years and 6% thereafter for a term of 2C years, including a grace
period of 5 years. The financial contribution of the government would be
made available to LMB on terms and conditions not less favorable than the
above. These terms are based on LYB's ability to service the debt from
project income. A project financing agreement acceptable to IDA, covering
the above terms of financing of project costs would be signed between
government and LMB.
Procurement and Disbursement
49.       Since LMB would execute most of the project, bulking of most
items for procurement would be feasible. Purchase of LMB vehicles and equip-
ment under contracts estimated at US$20,000 or more would be subject to
international competitive bidding. The construction of markets, stockroutes
and slaughter facilities would also be subject to international competitive
bidding but because the size of the individual contracts would be small,
advertising would be limited to local papers and those in Ethiopia's immediate
neighbors.
50.       The credit would be disbursed against the c.i.f. costs of imported
equipment, 100% of foreign expenditure for foreign personnel and consultant
services and 75% of all other costs, including civil works.
Economic Benefits
51.       The major benefits of the project arise frcom increased beef produc-
tion and improvement in the quality of hide production. The rate of return
to the Ethiopian economy is estimated at about 22% while the financial rate
of return to LMB would be about 9%. About 50% of the economic benefits
would be derived from meat saved on livestock using the improved markets and
stockroute system; about 30% from hide improvements; and the rest from
services from trucking and slaughtering and beef production on private
ranches. A substantial proportion of the benefits from improved hides are
expected from areas not covered by the slaughter facilities under the project.
The improvements in hide preparation in these areas are expected from the
demonstration effect of the project hide sheds, and the extension efforts of
the slaughter facilities and hide shed teams. Should this improvement not
materalize, then the economic rate of return would be about 15%.



- 12 -
52.       The project would generate additional foreign exchange earnings
from the increased value of hide exports. At full development the project
would result in $1 .0 million of additional foreign exchange earnings
annually.
53.       The project benefits would be well dispersed throughout the rural
areas. Nearly every family in the areas which would be served by the project
own some cattle and would benefit from higher prices resulting from the
operation of the project facilities. There would be substantial employment
effects from the project through the permanent increase in employment in
project facilities (about 1,100, mostly semi-skilled) and of about 3,000 man-
years during the construction period.
5L.       In addition, the project would be the first step in developing
the E&thiopian beef cattle industry by initiating programs to provide essen-
tial infrastructure, by reducing disease through expansion of veterinary
services and controlled cattle movement and by providing information for
future projects. Information obtained from development of the AIDB financed
fattening ranches would help in preparation of more extensive ranching
schemes. Operation of the LMB cattle trucks would provide data on opera-
ting techniques and costs as well as encourage private operators to provide
similar services.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Empire of
Ethiopia and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the
Association and the Livestock and Yeat Board, the Recommendations of the
Committee provided for under Article V, Section I(d), of the Articles of
Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Development
Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
56.       The draft agreements reflect the normal pattern for credits for
livestock projects. The relending of the proceeds of the credit will be
governed by a Project Financing Agreement between Government and LMB,
satisfactory to the Association.
57.       The following conditions of effectiveness are specified:
(i)     execution and delivery of the Project Agreement
between the Association and LNB;
(ii)    execution and delivery of a Project Financing
Agreement between government and LMB;
(iii)   employment of certain key Project staff; and
(iv)    satisfactory arrangements for the training of
certain Project personnel.



58.       I am satisfied that the proposed Developnent Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI  -  REOOiENDATION
59.       I reconmend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.        PROJECTS IN EXECUTION - ETHIOPIA 1/
Third Highway Project:   Credit 35-ET of February 27, 1963 - US$13.5 million
for (a) completion of road construction undertaken in the second highway
project, (b) construction and supervision of (i) a road (110 In) between
Lekempti and Ghimbi, (ii) a road (96 km) between Agaro and Bedelle, (c)
asphalting of 800 km of existing roads, (d) consulting services to provide
assistance to DIA management and for economic and engineering studies of a
road through the Awash Valley. The project has been completed. All construc-
tion work was completed in 1969; however, the closing date has been extended
until December 31, 1973 to allow for the processing of arbitration claims
which, inspite of the unavoidable delays, are progressing satisfactorily.
First Education Project:    Credit 84-ET of February 16, 1966 - The credit of
$7.2 million which assisted in the construction, expansion, furnishing and
equipping of secondary schools (54 new and 23 existing), teacher training
institutes (3 new), and technical institutes (one new and one existing) has
been completed. Project implementation required about six years as compared
with four and one-half as originally anticipated. An evaluation report on
the project is in preparation.
Fourth H4ighway Project: Loan 523-ET and Credit 111-ET of January 15, 1968.
Loan of $13.5 million and credit of $7.7 million to finance: (a) primary
road constructinn - 303 km of road between Awash and Tendaho, 118 km between
Bedelle and Mbta; (b) bituminous surfacing of primary roads - 125 1cm between
Nazareth and Awash, 45 km between Jimma and Agaro; (c) consulting services
for construction,supervision and preparation of feasibility studies and review
of design for 500 km of high priority roads; (d) advisory services and train-
ing. The project was late in starting because initial bids were high requir-
ing changes in specifications and issuance of new bid invitations. Perform-
ance has been good; three contracts have been completed, two of which were
completed ahead of schedule, aid all feasibility studies have been completed.
Power II, Finchaa Hydroelectric Project:    Loan 596-ET of May 9, 1969 -
$23.1 million to assist in financing the construction of an earth-filled dam
on the Finchaa River, a tributary of the Blue Nile, the purchase of three 33
MW generators, the construction of an associated 220 KV transmission line and
terminal substations, and a feasibility study for the next major generation
development project. The project is nearing completion and the power station
commenced commercial operations with two of the three sets commissioned in
early January 1973; about six months behind schedule. The third unit was dam-
aged in transit and commissioning may be delayed by up to six months pending
completion of repairs. Some minor works are still outstanding but all of these
should be completed and the loan fully disbursed by the closing date; December
31, 1973. The cost of the project has escalated by about 20% over the original
estimate but this increase is confined almost entirely to local costs.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.    Tley
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Procurement
Ar-rangements:            Procurement of vehicles and equipment under contracts
estimated at US$20,000 or more will be made in accord-
ance with international competitive bidding. Since
LNB would execute the main components of the Project,
bulking of most items would be feasible. As regards
civil works contracts for construction of markets,
stockroutes and slaughter facilities and equipment
contracts estimated at less than US$20,000, advertising
for bidding would be limited to local newspapers and
papers in neighboring countries because of the small
size of individual contracts.
Estimated Disbursement:                       (US $ million)

Project Management:       In connection with the Project, ten posts will be
created within LMB, of which five or six may have to
be filled by internationally recruited persons.
Appointments to these positions, including that of
Project Mnager, would be for a period of four years.
For those posts filled by non-Ethiopians, Ethiopians
would be recruited to serve as deputies and to event-
ually take over all posts except that of the Construc-
tion Officer, which would cease to exist when the
Project is completed.
