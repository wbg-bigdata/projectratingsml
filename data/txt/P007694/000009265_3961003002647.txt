MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESlDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.N.C. (NAFIN)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES "IU A
TRANSPORT AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT a    XCT FOR THE
MEXICO CITY METROPOLITAN AL.A
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandw!m and recendaton on a proposed loan
to Nacional Financiera S.N.C. (NAFIN) with the guarantee or the United Mexican States for an equivalent
of US$220 million to help finance the Govermnent of Mexico's Integrated Progran Against Air Pollution
for the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA).
2.    Backgcound. The MCMA comprises the Federal I)strict Departent (DDF) and 17 municipalities
in the neighboring State of Mexico (SoM). The MCMA population has grown from less than 1 million at
*           the beginning of the century to 15 million in 1990, and is projected to reach 20 million by 2010. Thirty
thousand industril establishments and about three million vehicles are based in the area. This
concentration of population and economic activity, together with the unfavorable topographic and weather
conditions, are the main causes of one of the most severe air pollution problems in the Western
Hemisphere. Health-based national and internatonal norms for ozone and particuate matter concentrations
are exceeded virtually every day, poWng particularly significant health threats. The highest ozone
concentrations on record ws rldwide were measured in the MICMA in March 1992. Carbon monoxide and
lead are also of concern. By far the largest source of air pollution is the transport sector. Causes of high
emissions include: the scale of transport activities; rapid growth in the vehicle fleet; lack of strngent
vehicle emission stndards and of reliable inspection procedures; a high proportion of old and poorly
maintaned vehicles; and traffic congestion, which results in stop-and-go travel conditions. Limited access
to credit is an important reason for the age of the high-use vehicle fleet.
3.    Attainment of air quality improvements in the MCMA has been hampered by an inadequate policy
framework, by poor coordinadon of the various agencies (federal, state and municipal) involved in policy
implementaton, by the weaknmess of the former Ministry of Urban Development and Ecology (SEDUE)
which bad been charged with setting vehicle emission standards, and of the enviromeal agencies of the
Federal District (DF) and SoM in charge of enforcing them. In the past few years air quality has
deteriorated to the point that it has become not only an important health but also an important political
issue; as a result air quality programs have been expanded rapidly and given much greater emphasis. An
Emergency Air Polludon Control Program was put into effect in 1989; and in September 1990, the
Government announced the Integrated Program Against Air Pollution, which is one of the most
comprehensive and ambitious ever attempted anywhere.
4.    The complexity and magnitude of the sector issues faced has led the Bank to conduct very
comprehensive sector work, which provides a solid underpinning to the proposed project. Internal and
external advisory panels guided the sector and project preparatory work. Two importnt policy issues
addressed under the proposed project are the availability of unleaded gasoline and the extent of misfueling
and reverse misfueling and institutional arrangements. Until November 1991, retail prices of leaded (Nova)
and unleaded gasoline (Magna Sin) were set at 710 and 1,000 Mexican pesos per liter equivalent to
US$0.87 and US$1.22 per gallon respectively. The large price differental encouraged misfueling of
catalyst equipped vehicles with leaded gasoline - a practice which destroys the effefciveness of the catalyst.
Recentdy, the Government has tak  important actions to addr  these issues: (a) in November 1991, the
Government raised the prices of leaded and unleaded gasolines by 55% and 25%, respeivey, brin&g
them to 1,100 and 1,250 Mexican pesos per liter (equivalent to US$1.34 and US$1.52 per gallon). InApril
1992 the price of unleaded gasoline was adjusted downward slightly to 1,220 Mexican pesos per liter,
equivalent to US$1.49 per gallon. The price differential has thus been reduced from 290 (40%) to 120
Mexican pesos (11%). Results from a recent survey carried out in the MCMA by independent consultans
show detectable levels of lead in the tailpipes of 12% of the catalyst-equipped private vehicles sampled, and



2
13% of the public transport vehicles. In the same survey, 28% of the owners of non-catalyst vehicles
reported reverse misfueling, use of Magna Sin in vehicles that do not require unleaded gasoline. Shortages
of Magna Sin have been a problem, 37% of private car drivers and of public transport operators stated that
they had problems finding Mapa Sin; and (b) in January 1992, the President issued a Decree creating a
new, permanent Commission for the Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution in the MCMA
(CMPCCA). The Decree contains seeral features sought by the Bank; in pardcular, CMPCCA is a
permanent insitution with clearly defined objectives and functions and it has a permanent Technical
Secretary and an Advisory Council, where leading scientists and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
are represented. In line with fte terms of the Decree, the DDF has created a new Department, the Generl
Directorate for Environmental Projects (DGPA), which constitutes the Technical Support Team for the
CMPCCA and its Technical Secretary. The Government has also created an Environmenta Trust Fund
(ETF), as the financial arm of CMPCCA with the National Bank of Public Works and Services
(BANOBRAS) as Trustee and with a Techtncal Committee, chaired by the Ministry of Finance and Public
Credit, on which the key members of the CMPCCA and its Technical Secretary are represented. The ETE
is to finance the projects recommended by the CMPCCA. At the end of May 1992, the Mexican Congress
approved a law which merged SEDUE into a newly-created Ministy of Social Development (SEDESOL).
ITe actviies of SEDUE's former Sub-Secetaiat for th Environmnt th  are essential for the proposed
project, i.e. the settng and enforcing of vehicle emission standards and the extension of the air quaity
monitoring sysem in the MCMA, are now the responsibility of the National Instiute of Ecology (IN>,
a dependency of SEDESOL, which is technically and admistratively auuwaomous.
5.          ecti^ . The objectives of the proposed project would be to: (a) reduce the growth
of emissiom of nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOC), carbon monoxide (CO), lead,
and of pardculate matter from transport sources; (b) develop a policy framework to support both transport
and air quality objectives; (c) improve the scientific base underlying the air quality program development
and management; and (d) strengthen insttutional capabilities to effctively plan and implement air-quality
progams over the long-term.
6.    Pit lpt           . The proposed project would comprise five inter-related componnts: (a)
Vehile Copnent (USSI -030.6 mllion in total project cost) including: (i) support to develop, promulgate
and enforce emission standards for new vehicles, (ii) progreive improvements to in-use emission
standar, and npecion and mainte         programs for high-use vehicles and private cars, (iis) lines of
credit to finance the replacement of old, high-use vehicles (taxis, trucks and minibuses) with new, emissio-
controlled vehicles, conversions of high-use vehicles to liquified petroleum gas (LPG) or compressed
natura gas (CNG), re-engining and retrofit of emissions controls, and (iv) impovements to the vehicle
registration system; (b) Fuel Component IU$$34.4 million) to help fund: (i) the installation of vapor
tecovery systems at service stations, and (ii) an alternative fuel pilot program to speed the convesion of
high-use vehicles to LPG or CNG; (c) Transport Policy and Maagement Component (US$2.7 mEillion
to help prepare an integrated Transport and Air Quality Management Strategy for the MCMA to meet both
tansport and air quality objecives. The Strategy would set the context for policies related to travel
demand manement, uban freight management, public transport and transport investment (d) Scint
BaSe Cmponent ( 1S$13.4 million' to help fund consultant services to strengthen air-qualit planning in
the MCMA through an integrated research plan and equipment for extending the air-quality monitoring
system, short-term  pollution feasting and the IMP mobile-source emiso   laboratory; and (e)
Inslitudonal Strengheng  Component (US$5.5 million) to support (i) insdtudonal strengthening of the
CMPCCA Technical Support Team, and of other agencies, particuarly those in the SoM related to air
pollution, and (ii) independent annual enviromnental audits. Ihe total project cost is estimated at
US$1,086.7 million equivalent, including taxes and duties (estimated at US$145.0 million) with a foreign
exchae compont of US$607.2 million (56 percent). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Retroactive financing of up to US$7 million would be granted for eligible project
expenditures incred after May 1, 1992.



3
7.    Proed Ftnncn . The Bank loan of US$220 million would finance about 20% of total projct
cost. Investments supported by the credit lines represent some 92% of total project cost. About two-thirds
of these investments will be financed by the private sector. An important part of the high-use vehicle fleet
modernizadon program would be expected to be financed by individual vehicle or fleet owners, commercial
banks and fnancial leasing. In order to accelerate the program, 77% of the proposed Banc loan proceeds
would be used to support lines of credit through BANOBRAS and NAFIN to finance, through participatig
financial intermediaries (PFIs), new taxis, minibuses, third party trucks ant own-account trucks, conversion
to LPG or CNG, and re-engining and retrofitltng. Erission testing and diagnostic equipment for private
garages would also be financed through the credit lines. In order to maintain maximum flexibility in the
use of funds, there would be no speciflc allocation within the credit lines to sub-components.
8.    The credit lines to be financed by the Bank are aimed pdmarily at individual vehicle owners or
small enterprises having limited access to credit. The forced high-use vehicle replacement program, which
will generate large positive environmental benefits, is unlikely to be implemented on a timely basis and on
the massive scale intended, unless the credit is provided to these beneficiaries on terms which encourage
them to replace their old vehicles with new vehicles rather than with newer but used vehicles. This would
have a positive impact on pollution reduction and justifies below market final lending rates ranging at
present from 27% to 29%, compared with a market rate of about 33%. All these rates are highly positive
in real terms.
9.    NAFIN, as financial agent of the Government, would transfer the proceeds of the proposed loan
to the Government, which would in turn, be responsible for onending the proceeds of the proposed loan
tD BANOBRAS and NAFIN (as executing agencies for the lines of credit) and to the Mexican Petroleum
Institute (IMP), making fimds available through budgetary allocations to SEDESOLAINE, and for
transferring funds to the ETF. The ETF would enter into a contract, satsfctory to the Bank, with the
Government and SoM, whereby the Government (through the DDF) comnits to carry out its project
execution obligations m exchange for reimbursement from the ETF of its relevant project execution
expenditwu. The ETP would be empowered to cease disbursements to an executing agenqy that defauts
on the terms of its contract. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursement of the proposed
Bank loan, and the disbursement schedule for the Bank loan are shown in Schedue B. A dmetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Mexico are given in Scheduls C and
D, respecdively. A Map (IBRD 24056) is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 10673-ME, dated
November 20, 1992, is being distributed separately.
10.   Prjec Implementatio. Under the leadership of CMPCCA's Technical Secretary, the Technical
Support Team for the CMPCCA, including a project coordinator, would be responsible for program and
project coordination and overall supervsion, including the preparation of periodic reports to the Bank.
BANOBRAS and NAFIN would be executng agencies for the credit lines for the high-use vehicle fleet
modernization program and emission testing and diagnostic equipment for private garages. SEDESOL
through INE would be the execudng agency for vehicle emission standards; the DDF General Directorate
of Ecology (DGE) would execute the insecion and maintenance (1M) system, and woud be responsible,
in coordination with the Mexican Petroleum Company (PEMEX) and the SoM, for the gasoline vapor
recovery systems to be instlled at service station tanks and retail gasoline pumps; PEMEX would be
responsible, in coordination with DGE and SoM, for vapor recovery systems insalled at petroleum
terninals and tank trucks; the DDP General Directorate for Environmental Projects (DGPA) would be the
executing agency for the alternative fuel pilot program and the transport policy and management component
(through the Metropolitan Transport Councl (COTAM)), which has no juridical personality, and with the
paticipadon of SoM); the DGPA, in coordination with INE and the Ministry of Health, would be
responsible for work on the scientific base; and the Mexican Petroleum Instute (IMP) woud be
responsible for its own laboratory. The DGPA would be the execuing agency for the institutional
sengthening component. NAFIN would contract a group of independent experts to car out the auml
enviromnental audits.

11.   Lessons from  evious BAnk Inxlvement. The main lessons from three relevant projects (two
in Mexico and one in Brazil), and one ongoing proJect in Mexico, are: (i) that the preconditin for a
successful vehicular pollution abatement program is the existence of a proper legal basis and adequate
institutions to plan, coordinate and implement the program; such institutions must be able to rely upon the
services of well trained professionals and have assured sources of financing; and (ii) that there is the need
for flexibility on the part of the Bank in financing projects in this relatively new field, which Is subject to
frequent technological changes and to improvements in the underlying scientific base.
12.   Proiect Sustainability. During recent months the Mexican authorides have taken a number of
important steps towards ensuring the sustainability of the air pollution control effort. Tey have relied
increasingly on market incentives to control air pollution, as evidenced by the increase in the price of
gasoline. As noted in para. 4, the ad hoc institutions which hand:ad preparation of the and-pollution
program, have been transformed by Presidendal Decree into a permanent Metropolitan Commission, the
CMPCCA with the ETF as its financial arm. A representative of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit
is a permanent member of the CMPCCA and will assume the presidency of the Technical Comiittee,
which will allocate the ETF's resources. This should help ensure the allocation of adequate resources for
the over-all program and the proposed project. The Decree to create the ETF leaves open the option that
resources raised by applying the "polluter pays" principle, (such as the tax on old, heavily polluting
vehicles, recently imposed by the DDF, increased I/M fees and/or possible fuel surcharges in the MCMA)
could be channelled directly to the ETF. At the same time, as noted, the environmental agencies of the
DF have been reorganized and the staff and budget of the new DGPA, which serves as the Technicai
Support Team for the CMPCCA, substantially increased. Under the terms of a new State law, the powers
and responsibilidties of the SoM Ecological Commission have been greatly increased and it has been
transformed into a Secretariat with a much enlarged staff and increased budget resources.
13.   Ratonl for Bank Involvement.  As the Govermnent's economic stabilizaton program
successfiuly consolidates and prospects for sustained economic growth have increased, the Bank's lending
strategy towards Mexico attaches priority to poverty alleviation programs, rebuiding and expanding the
country's infrastructure to permit private sector led growth and addressing environmenta problems. The
proposed project fits into the latter category. The Bank is already contributing to the Emergency Program
through reallocation of resources from Loan 2824-ME (Memorandum of the President, December 22,
1989), and has participated in the development of the Integrated Program from its beginning. Moreover,
the Bank has signed a "broadened" cofinancing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of Japan, under
which it is providing technical assistance concerning the environmental aspects of PEMEX's projects to
produce unleaded gasoline, (which are being financed by the Export-Import Bank of Japan), and will
continue to assess the conistency of the overall Program. The urgent need for action to improve air
quality in the MCMA, the evident commitment of the Government to addresig the issue, and its
demonstrated willingness and ability to take bold actions when necessary to improve air quality jusify Bank
support for the air quality program, despite significant risks (para. 4). The Bank is well placed to assist
the Government to take such a systematic planning approach which, by its scale and complexity, the air
quality problem in the MCMA requires. It can help develop a sustainable institutional arrangement for air
quality planning and coordinadon with a metropolitan focus as wett as the policy framework required for
program development and implementation. It can also lend assistance to help strengthen existing institutions
charged with implemendng air quality programs.
14.   Actions Agrd. During neotdations, agreement was reached or confirmed on the following main
issues: (a) that the Government would: (i) provide unleaded gasoline sufficient to meet demand in the
MCMA throughout project implementation; (ii) ensure that the rates of misfueling of catalyst-equipped
private and public transport vehicles in the MCMA do not increase from the present level; (iii) make its
best efforts to reduce such misfiueling rates; (iv) make its best efforts to resolve any problems of reverse
misfueling; (v) cause the CMPCCA to carry out, through independent consultants and under terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank, an annual survey of the availability of unleaded gasoline and the extent
of misfueling and reverse misfteling in the MCMA; and (vi) make the results of the surveys avai "ble to



5
the Bank for the annual reviews; (b) if the Gasoline Project of PEMEX, financed by the Export-Import
Bank of Japan is not implemented, the Bank may suspend disbursements under its loan; (c) that: (i) by
January 1, 1993, aicenes to operate taxis in the MCMA would not be provided or renewed for taxis that
are more than six years old; (ii) new taxis financed under the program would meet Mexican emissi.on
standards for model-year 1993 and onwards; and (iii) the Bank would need to be satisfied as to the
following items for minibuses and trucks: (1) policies for vehicle replacement, conversion to LPG or CNG,
re-engining, and retrofitting; and (2) measures to avoid the continued use of *replaced vehicles" as high-use
vehicles in the MCMA beyond the age limits set in the Government's high-use vehicle replacement
program; (d) that the CMPCCA Technical Supp>.t Team would form a Working Group between PEMEX,
the DDF and SoM, no later than December 1, 1992 to coordinate the gasoline vapor recovery program;
(e) the Government would provide adequate counterpart funding for the project; (t) that: (i) the DDF would
provide through the implementation period of the project budgetary allocations sufficient to cover, at least,
the cost of 25 professionals of the Technical Support Team and its operational cost; and (ii) the CMPCCA
would develop a training program for the staff of the Technical Support Team, and of executing agencies;
(g): (i) BANOBRAS' and NAFIN's operating rules for the credit lines; (ii) eligibility criteria for PFIs; (iii)
general terms of relending contracts between NAFIN, BANOBRAS and PFls; (iv) infbrmation to be
provided to the Bank fo; authorizing sub-loans; (v) lending rates and terms to PFIs and final beneficiaries;
(vi) that BANOBRAS and NAFIN carry out their promotional campaigns; and (vli) that sub-loan reflows
would be used during the grace period of the Bank loan to finance additional vehicles (including buses)
conversions, re-engining and retrofitfting; (h) procurement arrangements (Schedule B, page 1); (i)
retroactive financing of up to US$7 million equivalent for project expenditures incurred in accordance with
Bank procurement guidelines afer May 1, 1992; (j): (i) timetable for the initiation, completion and
discussion with the Bank of technical assistance and studies, and (ii) implementaton and impact indicators;
(k) that anal reviews would be held each year in September and conclude with an agreed action plan; and
(1) a mid-term review would be held with the participation of the external advisory panel in September
1994, and agree on changes in project implementadon and schedule, if required. A onition for loan
efecd      w ould be presentation to the Bank of satsfactory signed and legally binding contractual
arrangements between NAFIN, the Guarantor, the ETF, and executing agencies.
15.   Environmental Imgat. The proposed operation has an environmental ruting of "C" and is
expected to result in major environmental benefits through reduced air pollution (see para. 16); no potential
adverse environmental impact has been identified.
16.   Proec  enefit. Air pollution in Mexico City is a major and increasing threat to public health.
Benefits due to its abatement include: decreased incidence of illness and premature death due to respiratory
and cardiovascular illness, and improvements in the overall well-being and quality of life of the population.
Data on blood lead concentrations in children, and the effects of these concentrations on intellectual
development and learning indicate that, viewed as an investment in human capital, the project woud have
very high reurns. Increased worker productivity and school performance due to a lessened incidence of
respiratory disease and respiratory discomfort are also likely, and the need to shut down industrial activity
and extend the school holidays would be reduced. Non-health related benefits are expected to include
increased crop yields, reduced damage to building materials and increased tourism. Although it is not
possible to make precise estimates of likely air pollution reductions as a result of the proposed project and
the additiona' Government me es, some tentative esdmates have been made for 1995, by which time
most of the project sub-componnts are planned to be implemented. If no actions were taken, by 1995
motor-vehicle related emissions are estimated to increase by 0.52 miliion toxicity-weighted tons, over the
1989 level, to 1.84 .nillion tos per year. The project would reduce emissions growth by 0.44 million tons,
resulting in motor-vehicle related emissions of 1.40 million tons for 1995, offsetting to a large extent the
esimated emissions growth. Additional Government measures having quantifiable emissions impacts are
esdmated to result in a firther reduction of 0.75 million toxicity-weighted tons, resuting in a measurable
net improvement in environmental conditions by 1995, despite population and economic growth. However,
considering the technical, operational and institutional risks involved in the program, the estinated
emissions reducdons may well -oresent a 'high case' estiation and the emissions reductions achieved



6
may be actually lower. On the other hand, significant uuluantifiable benefits from other project and
Government measures have been omitted from the esdmates.
17.     rlect Rkiks. The project poses technical, operadonal, and institutional risks. Transport air
pollution is a relatively new area for the Bank, and involves many difficult technical issues. There is thus
some possibility that the program may not fully achieve its objectives, or that priorities may be found, In
retrospect, to have been misplaced. To minimize this risk, the Bank has zonducted extensive sector work.
The Bank has also established both internal and external advisory panels, and has retained expert
consultants to provide advice and guidance. The technical basis underlying the proposed project has been
endorsed by the external advisory panel and by participants In an international air quality management
seminar held recently in Mexico City, which included senior representatives from both the German and
U.S. environmental protection agencies, and Mexican and international experts. The decision to rely on
measures which have already been proven in industiaized countries would also help to minimize the riak
of making a serious error, as would the heavy emphasis on studies to develop the underlying scientific base
and evaluation methodology for air quality program planning. Institutional issues will be addressed through
well focussed technical assistance and intensive Bank supervision.
18.   RMLu=dafiW. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Ardcles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
