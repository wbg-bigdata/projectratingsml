0.1 Introduction

The project evaluated in this Implementation Completion and Results report (ICR) is one of
twenty-nine projects funded by the Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF), which are all part of a much
larger programmatic approach to support Nile cooperation. Because of the complementary and
strategic nature of the projects, it would be incomplete to either evaluate the individual projects in
isolation of the overall programmatic framework or fail to look at the role each NBTF project
played in building Nile cooperation. This preface provides an overview of the coordinated partner
support to the Nile countries through and in coordination with the NBTF, to provide background
and context for the individual project ICR that follows.

The NBTF was created to support a trend of increasing cooperation in the Nile region. In 1995,
the Nile governments established the Nile Council of Ministers of Water Resources (Nile-COM)
and designed the Nile River Basin Action Plan, identifying 22 technical assistance projects which
aimed to address economic development and equitable use of the Nile waters. In 1999, the Nile-
COM adopted a long-term Shared Vision: to achieve sustainable socio-economic development
through equitable utilization of and benefit from, the common Nile Basin water resources. More
specifically, Nile Ministers adopted policy guidelines, “to develop the water resources of the Nile
Basin in a sustainable and equitable way to ensure prosperity, security and peace for all its
people; to ensure efficient water management and the optimal use of the resources; to ensure
cooperation and joint action between the Nile Basin countries; to target poverty eradication and
promote economic integration; and to ensure that the program results in a move from planning to
action.?
                                       In order to advance these policy guidelines, the Nile-COM
        Shared Vision                  endorsed cooperation built around a Strategic Action
                                       Program with two complementary concepts: the need to
        Shared                         enable a common basis to achieve the Shared Vision for the
        Vision                         Nile Basin and the need to advance projects that benefited
       Program                         “the people and particularly the poor and disadvantaged in
                  Subsidiary           the Nile Basin.? As a result, Nile-COM endorsed two
                    Action             programs: the Shared Vision Program (SVP) and the
                                       Subsidiary Action Program (see Figure 1). First, the Shared
                   Program
                                       Vision Program was designed to build trust, confidence, and
    Action on the Ground               an enabling environment for the sustainable and equitable
                                       use of the Nile resources among water professionals and the

Design of Early Nile Programs can only be legitimized by action on the ground,? the
                                       Subsidiary Action Program (SAP), one for the Eastern Nile
                                       and one for the Equatorial Lakes, which focused on
investment projects that addressed agricultural needs, environmental risks, energy, and river
management. To implement these programs, the following year the Nile-COM ministers agreed
to establish the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) as a transitional institutional arrangement. At
establishment, NBI’s member states were Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda with Eritrea holding observer status.
Membership is now ten countries with South Sudan joining in July 2012.



                                                  1
In 2001, the Nile Basin governments and international development partners convened for the
International Consortium for Cooperation on the Nile (ICCON) in Geneva to discuss the Nile
Shared Vision and the proposed programs, pledging US$140 million for their implementation.
Based on the interest expressed by the Nile-COM and partners at ICCON, a multi-donor funding
mechanism, the Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF), was established at the World Bank in 2003 with a
consortium of ten international donors 1 to support the countries in their pursuit of the Shared
Vision. Several donors also supported the NBI directly in coordination with the NBTF. With
this considerable partnership, overall financial support to NBI has far exceeded the ICCON
pledges.

Over the ten years, the NBTF supported
twenty-eight completed NBI projects as part
of the Shared Vision and Subsidiary Action
Programs, and an Institutional Strengthening
Project. The last set of projects closed at the
end of 2012 (Table 1). To enable full
disbursement of NBTF funds in support of
NBI, partners to the NBTF agreed a two year
extension of the fund until June 2015. An
additional project, the Nile Cooperation for
Results (NCORE) Project, was therefore                                                                Eastern Nile

0.2 NBTF Achievements to Date

The NBTF supported the Nile countries to            Figure 2: NBI Centers
establish the NBI as a transitional
institutional mechanism. The NBI is the only regional water organization for all Nile Basin
countries, aiming to operate as a catalyst for integrated growth, investment and risk management
to achieve the Shared Vision. To carry out the Shared Vision and Subsidiary Action Programs,
the three NBI Centers were formed; the NBI Secretariat in Entebbe, Uganda and two Subsidiary
Action Program offices, the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
and the Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action Program – Coordination Unit in Kigali, Rwanda
(Figure 2).

  Contributors to the NBTF are: Canada, Denmark, European Commission, Finland, France, Netherlands,
Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom and the World Bank. Partners providing bilateral financing include
Germany, Sweden, and the African Development Bank. The United Nations Development Program and
the United States are active in the development partnership and support efforts to increase Nile cooperation
outside but in coordination with the NBTF partnership.

The governance structure is aligned with the basin-wide/sub-basin structure of the Nile Basin
Initiative, (Figure 3). A Nile Council of Ministers and a Technical Advisory Committee (Nile-
TAC) guides the basin-wide work of the NBI Secretariat (Nile-SEC). At the level of the Eastern
Nile sub-basin, an Eastern Nile Council of Ministers (EN-COM) and an Eastern Nile Strategic
Action Program Technical Committee (ENSAPT) provide governance oversight. In the Nile
Equatorial Lakes sub-basin, the Nile Equatorial Lakes Council of Ministers (NEL-COM) and the
Nile Equatorial Lakes Technical Advisory Committee (NEL-TAC) provide governance services.

Through the ten projects under the Shared Vision Program (SVP), the NBI has improved
collaboration within the Basin. The US$87 million Shared Vision Program was designed to build
trust, strengthen capacity, and advance the enabling environment for investment in the Nile Basin.
The program created networks and partnerships that brought people together across the Basin
countries in various water-related sectors. According to a 2008 opinion poll, 2the program
created measurably greater levels of trust among such stakeholder categories as lawyers, media
professionals and women leaders. Through work on joint projects on a range of critical issues, the
SVP advanced a shared understanding of the need for regional engagement between the countries,
including in water resource management, environment, wetlands, and regional power trade. The
projects yielded a more organized knowledge base, a Decision Support System (DSS) and other
tools to better understand, model and analyze the basin, an inventory of wetlands, plans for
watershed management and regional power generation and transmission, studies of agricultural
productivity and opportunities for water savings, and trained over 2,000 professionals.




Figure 3: NBI Governance Structure

The Shared Vision Program provided platforms to bring country officials together at the policy
and the technical level. Based on these platforms, technical cooperation was strengthened
thereby helping basin-wide processes and practices to be shared and consolidated. By establishing
and managing a shared institution, and by collaborating on development projects and risk-
management strategies, the Nile Basin countries established common principles, without which
long-term cooperation would be difficult. Various project teams are in continuing contact across
countries, through other NBI projects, or other initiatives. The NBI is also establishing an

integrated policy environment, including a suite of policies called the Nile Basin Sustainability
Framework.

The NBI centers have improved the collation, analysis, and access to information relating to the
Nile basin, including a procedures and norms for date and information sharing and exchange. The
NBI has helped foster greater exchange not only on the river itself but on energy, agriculture and
trade opportunities. NBI is a platform that can be used as a mechanism to notify each other of
certain planned development projects using Nile waters.

Given its programmatic nature, the Shared Vision Program was reviewed by the World Bank in a
Programmatic Implementation Completion and Results Report in June 2010 3. The report
reviewed the achievements of the seven thematic projects as well as the umbrella coordination
project (Table 1). The Programmatic ICR found that the Outcomes, Bank performance and
Grantee Performance were all moderately satisfactory, with the risk to development outcomes
being rated as substantial.

While the outputs of many of the SVP projects were mainstreamed into other on-going initiatives,
two SVP projects implemented second phases; the Regional Power Trade Project which
produced a Comprehensive Basin-wide Study of Power Development Options and Trade
Opportunities: Proposed Development Options, Strategies and Investment Arrangements; and the
Water Resources Planning and Management Project extended the closing date until December 31,
2012 to complete the Nile Basin Decision Support System - this second phase of support has been
reviewed in a new ICR. 4

The Subsidiary Action Program helped identify and prepare investments of transboundary
significance to improve the livelihoods of the basin’s neediest populations and promote
sustainable growth through improved watershed management, flood preparedness, agricultural
improvement, power generation, and transmission. It also helped facilitate agreement among
countries to move some investments forward – such as the regional Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric
Project that is expected to make a significant contribution to access to power in Burundi, Rwanda,
and Tanzania. The NBI facilitated US$919 million of investment projects currently under
implementation, with a further US$1.584 billion under preparation (Table 2).

In addition, Subsidiary Action Program has helped the countries to consolidate their knowledge
of the sub-basins and develop new tools and applications to help better identify and plan
investments of regional significance. ENTRO and NELSAP-CU have provided studies and
analysis to their member governments to improve planning and implementation of regional
sustainable development projects. The NBI issues regional flood bulletins with hydrological
forecasts for the Eastern Nile to assist national, regional and community authorities in predicting
floods. University networks, especially in the Eastern Nile, have been strengthened through
collaborative studies, internship programs, and workshops.

                                                                    capacity, to harmonize
corporate management, as well as to consolidate the gains of the SVP and SAPs. The project
started in 2008 and closed in December 2012. Through ISP, the NBI clarified its core functions
developed a five year Strategic Plan and a Financing Strategy to advance its sustainability. As a
result of this work, the Nile governments committed to incrementally increase their direct
financial contributions to the NBI to cover the core costs of the institution by 2017 (FY2018).

The NBI has also developed a suite of Strategic Plans for each Center and a consolidated concept
note of projects for 2013 – 2017 which was presented to development partners in November 2011.
The overarching Strategic Plan, (Figure 4) shows how the NBI’s current work expands its
original programmatic structure including the Shared Vision and Subsidiary Action Programs.

As part of implementing the new Strategic Plan and building on other projects, the NBI prepared
the Nile Cooperation for Results (NCORE) Project. This project is supporting NBI activities in
its three core functions of facilitating cooperation, water resource management, and water
resource development.

The support provided through the ISP enabled results to be achieved across the NBI, including
the twenty-one other SVP and SAP projects that were undertaken by the NBI during ISP
implementation, as well as the subsequent work that was enabled by the ISP project. While a
stand-alone ICR for the ISP project has been produced 7, the breadth of the ISP results can only
truly be assessed when looking at the successes and lessons of the other NBI efforts as well.

0.3 Other Programmatic Evaluations

Given the historic nature of the approach of the Nile Ministers, as well as the lessons that can be
learned for future transboundary efforts, the World Bank and the Development Partners have
recently commissioned an Independent Evaluation of the Nile Basin Trust Fund. While the
Independent Evaluation is still being finalized, it assessed that the NBTF was a highly appropriate
mechanism for funding the NBI’s Strategic Action Program, and that the portfolio of projects was
relevant to the objectives of the NBI. It also highlighted areas needing further strengthening
including sustainability and communications. The lessons learned from the Independent
Evaluation will provide a valuable complement to the project level findings and lessons of the
individual project ICRs.

0.4 Political track of activity

In parallel to the technical activities being undertaken through the NBI, and outside the support
provided by the Nile Basin Trust Fund, the Nile governments undertook negotiations on the text
of a water agreement on the Nile, the Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA). This was
opened for signature, with six Nile countries signing the agreement, although two opposed certain
provisions. One country to date has ratified. Disagreements over the text of the document and
process by which the document was opened for signature have affected the work of the NBI, with
two countries freezing participation in NBI regional activities pending the clarification of aspects
of the disagreement. While the political situation has lessened the impact of some of the
technical activities undertaken by the NBI, the NBI has found ways to continue to advance
cooperation and to provide technical assistance to continue to assist the Nile countries to assess
transboundary issues associated with Nile water management and development.

0.5 Conclusion

International experience has demonstrated that building cooperation in large international river
basins requires sustained engagement over many decades. For Nile Basin governments, shifting
from a national orientation with limited collaboration to a regional approach was, and continues
to be, a significant challenge. The Nile Basin countries with NBI support have made strides in
sharing information, planning development programs and collaborating on investments. Today,
the NBI has strengthened its institutional capacity, partnerships, and regional processes as well as
its tools and procedures for cooperative water resources planning, development, and management
in the Nile Basin – these will further evolve as institutional structures evolve over time. This ICR
is an evaluation of one particular project as part of these overall inter-linked efforts to foster Nile
cooperation and should be viewed in this context.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Sectoral context. Water has played, and continuous to play, a central role in the history and
political economy of the Eastern Nile basin, and has shaped its socio-economic and
environmental dimensions. The Eastern Nile basin constitutes over 60% of the Nile River Basin,
covers approximately 1.7 million kilometers square (km2), and comprises four sub-basins: the
Baro-Akobo-Sobat and White Nile, the Abbay/Blue Nile, the Tekeze-Atbara-Setit, and the Main
Nile from Khartoum to the Nile Delta (see Map). The Eastern Nile basin is an important shared
resource linking Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan (pre-independence of South Sudan), and a small
portion of Eritrea. The system offers substantial opportunities for investments to develop multi-
purpose storage and hydropower, improve agricultural production and improve watershed
management. However, tensions over these resources have been a major constraint to economic
growth and opportunities for trade and regional integration.

The Eastern Nile region is home to about 154 million people, and is characterized by extreme
poverty, rapid population growth, environmental degradation and political instability. Inadequate
development and management of the water resources of the region have been a major constraint
to economic growth and livelihood improvement in a region characterized by extreme poverty,
political instability, rapid population growth, and environmental degradation. Poverty levels are
still very high; in many parts of the Basin, access to basic water, sanitation, and power services is
still very low, and the impacts of water-related diseases are high. Economic development is
uneven and often dependent in many areas on the vagaries of climate (especially given the high
degree of reliance of livelihoods in many parts of the basin on rainfed agriculture) and frequent
floods and droughts undermine progress. Only a small percentage of the irrigation and
hydropower potential has been developed. In existing agricultural areas, yields, crop intensities
and irrigation efficiencies are low. Deforestation and land degradation are serious, contributing
to low soil productivity and increased downstream sedimentation.

The region faces significant challenges in the future. Continued erosion in the highlands,
salinization of the land and waters in the delta, susceptibility to floods and droughts, and inter-
sectoral and inter-regional water conflicts threaten the livelihoods of many in the region and the
trends are not encouraging. The infrastructure to manage climate variability (e.g. multi-purpose
storage or large-scale watershed development) is very limited. Climate change threatens the
region from the point of view of unknown changes in rainfall and streamflow timing and
magnitude, increased crop water requirements, increased evaporation losses, and increased
potential for saline water intrusion. Continuing unilateral development may result in benefits
within each country but are often sub-optimal from a basin viewpoint, posing challenges of water
infrastructure operational coordination, managing system losses, impacting flexibility, and
potentially foreclosing future cooperative options. All this increases the risk that the region will
not achieve the kinds of economic transformation that is required to make substantive poverty
improvements in the entire basin.

The Eastern Nile also offers substantial opportunity for development. The system offers
substantial opportunities for investments to develop hydropower, improve agricultural
production, and mitigate floods and droughts. Meaningful cooperation is essential to both better
take advantage of opportunities and to better face evolving challenges. The transboundary nature
of the Eastern Nile offers a unique opportunity for cooperative development and management to
realize the economic potential of the region by optimizing the development of its water resources


                                                 10
in a larger basin context to sustainably improve water productivity and manage evolving risks
(e.g. floods, droughts, and climate change) that could spill-over to facilitate overall regional
development and collaboration. Such cooperation would require shared knowledge, institutional
capacity, and coordinated and well-analyzed investments.

At the time of conceptualization and preparation of the Eastern Nile Planning Model (ENPM)
Project, the knowledge base of the Eastern Nile basin was fragmented and inconsistent, sharing of
information was minimal (including in the public domain), and there was a lack of shared,
modern, flexible analytical/modeling tools to envision various development scenarios and analyze
their implications from economic, environmental and social viewpoints. There were no strong
stakeholder forums (including among Universities) to use this information and analysis to
systematically inform investment decisions on the Eastern Nile. This status quo was a major
impediment to building consensus on cooperative investments in the basin and deciding where
further studies were required. The ENPM Project was expected to address these issues by
improving the knowledge base, develop a suite of analytical tools, and build capacity to explore
evolving risks and opportunities in the basin.

Regional strategy. Since the 1990s, Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan have made significant strides in
strengthening Eastern Nile cooperation. It started with the launch of the Eastern Nile Subsidiary
Action Program (ENSAP) in 1999, within the framework of the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI). In
launching ENSAP, the Eastern Nile Council of Ministers (ENCOM) agreed to ensure efficient
water management and optimal use of resources, target poverty alleviation, and promote
economic integration through cooperative investments. The first joint institution of the three
countries – the Eastern Nile Regional Technical Office (ENTRO) – was established in 2002 to
oversee the preparation of the Eastern Nile investment program.

During the mid-2000, considerable progress was being made in the preparation of the first group
of ENSAP projects, called Integrated Development of Eastern Nile (IDEN), which included fast-
track projects intended to demonstrate early benefits of cooperation, and multi-purpose track
program and projects expected to be more complex and time-consuming in relation to pursuing
separate national agendas. One of the fact-track projects – largely sectorally-focused, nationally
implemented projects agreed in a regional context – identified as part of the original ENSAP
investment portfolio to be critical to such cooperation was this ENPM Project (hereafter the
Project). There was significant support from all Eastern Nile countries for the Project, including
letters of commitment from Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan.

High level Bank commitment. Since 1998, the World Bank had been intensively engaged with
the countries of the Nile Basin under the NBI to promote cooperative development and
management of the Nile River. It supported the NBI since its inception by facilitating cooperation
and dialogue, coordinating donor contributions through a multi-donor Nile Basin Trust Fund
(NBTF), promoting institutional development, and providing technical assistance and advisory
services. At the request of ENCOM, the Bank played a leading role in the implementation of the
Joint Multi-purpose Program (JMP) aiming at providing the analytical underpinnings to support
investment planning of the Eastern Nile. For the three recipient countries, Egypt, Ethiopia and
Sudan (pre-independence of South Sudan), the Project was consistent with the high level of Bank
commitment to promote cooperative development and management of the Nile and the objective
set in Country Assistance Strategies (CAS) and Country Water Resources Assistance Strategies
(CWRAS) of providing a framework to analyze and prepare future cooperative investments in the
Eastern Nile.



                                               11
Rationale for Bank involvement. The ENPM Project was considered to be a critical input to the
objectives of the NBI and the work of the World Bank. Support for the Project would promote the
objectives of the CASs and CWRASs of the Eastern Nile countries and would provide a
framework for cooperative dialogue and planning of future regional investments. The Project
would also help the Bank to tap its expertise in international river basins and in such knowledge-
driven decision-support processes to assist the Eastern Nile countries in realizing a higher level of
cooperation. Experience in other international river basins had also indicated the need to
strengthen the collation, organization, analysis, dissemination, and use of basin information to
build a shared awareness of key evolving issues in the Basin, and to better inform future
cooperative investments. It was expected that such an activity would also help ENTRO integrate
a decade of detailed studies and strengthen its knowledge and analytical services to the region.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The development objective of the Project, according to both the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) and the Grant Agreement, was that countries in the Eastern Nile operationalize an
improved decision support modeling framework to identify water-related investments and
evaluate them in a regional context.

To track progress towards achieving the above mentioned development objective, the following
key outcome indicators were proposed during the course of Project preparation, as reflected in the
PAD Results Framework and Monitoring (Annex 3):

    •   Number of projects in Eastern Nile for which investment strategies are based on the
        ENPM analysis;
    •   Number of regional and national meetings facilitated by ENPM outputs; and
    •   Number of senior professionals in regional/national institutions using ENPM [products].

Key intermediate indicators, as reflected in the main text of the PAD, were also agreed:

    •   Development of a shared interactive Eastern Nile Knowledge Base and dissemination of
        a State of the Eastern Nile Report;
    •   Development of modeling tools to systematically evaluate Eastern Nile investments in a
        regional context, examining economic, environmental and social aspects as allowed by
        available data;
    •   Strong institutions at regional and national levels (in Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan) with
        adequate capacity and partners (e.g., University Outreach Centers) to be a focal point for
        knowledge and analysis on water investments on the Eastern Nile; and
    •   Collaboration with the Nile Decision Support System (DSS).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

Not Revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

Although the PAD does not explicitly define the expected Project beneficiaries, it is safe to say
that the primary intended beneficiaries of the Project were the NBI (including ENTRO itself,
ENCOM, the ENSAP Team, and the NBI Secretariat through Nile DSS synergy), who would

                                                 12
benefit from the efforts to strengthen Eastern Nile interaction and cooperation; the national-level
governments, and universities from Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan (pre-independence of South
Sudan), who would have a lot to gain from increased knowledge, sharing of information and
analytical tools, capacity building and training; and in general, the 154 million people living in
the Eastern Nile basin, civil society organizations, and donor community, who would
significantly benefit from the joint management of risks of water-related impacts (in particular
floods, droughts and climate change) and the joint development of productive opportunities (in
particular optimization of power and irrigation development and watershed management).

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The Project components were based on the ENPM framework (developed by an international
consulting firm) with inputs from a regional working group conformed by Eastern Nile riparian
representatives. As designed, the Project included the following complementary components:

Component A: Knowledge Base Development. This component’s primary objective was to
develop the knowledge base for the Eastern Nile to provide a shared, synoptic view of the Eastern
Nile basin, including its opportunities and risks as viewed from an economic, environmental and
social perspective. It was expected that the baseline data would be organized systematically in a
Geographic Information System (GIS) platform with an associated web portal, and that an
effective use would be made of modern datasets from satellite remote sensing and other
global/regional datasets.
Component B: Modeling System. This component’s objective was to develop the ENPM
modeling system to include a suite of simulation, optimization and multi-criteria analytical tools.
It was expected that the models would build on a water systems “spine? using tools developed by
the Nile Basin DSS to help analyze the economic, environmental and social aspects of proposed
investments in a water resources systems framework and to evaluate alternative scenarios of the
future. It was also expected that the tools developed would draw upon and contribute to the
knowledge base developed under Component A, and would be flexible enough to adapt to
changing needs and increasing information availability.
Component C: Institutional and Human Capacity Building. This Component was to support a
structured stakeholder process to ensure that the systems developed are driven by multi-sectoral
stakeholder demand and appropriate to support decision-making. It was expected that the
proposed ENPM Project (developed in collaboration with the Nile DSS) and associated training
would strengthen ENTRO as a strong knowledge-driven regional institution, as well as improve
the capacity of national institutions, reducing the current disparity in national capacity for such
activities. Networking with academia and other international river basins were to be pursued to
improve cross-fertilization of ideas and sustainability.

1.6 Revised Components

Not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

Revision of implementation arrangements at Mid-Term Review (MTR). The implementation
modality for the development of the regionally shared modeling systems was changed during the
MTR from using a large consultancy firm to support the development of the ENPM systems to in-
house development at ENTRO. This change was necessary given the deterioration in the regional
cooperation environment related to the Cooperative Framework Agreement and the consequent
                                                13
problems faced by ENTRO (after two countries froze their participation in the NBI) to obtain
approval from ENCOM to proceed with the signing of the large consultancy contract and the
limited time then remaining to deliver on the requested scope of work. Under the new
implementation modality (“Plan B?), substantial emphasis was given to the use of young
professionals from the riparian universities and ministries through the implementation of an
internship program, university partnerships, specialized smaller firm and individual consultancies
(including in-house consultants) for the development of key Project products. This change
provided an opportunity to further build technical capacity within ENTRO and create of a
community of Eastern Nile modelers linked to Eastern Nile universities.

Extension of the closing date. The Project was extended by two months from the original closing
date of October 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012 to allow for orderly closure of the Project
activities after a delayed start, to align with the Nile DSS closing, and to ensure continuity of
ENTRO activities with a new project (Nile Cooperation for Results Project) that was being
prepared to start at the beginning of 2013.

Inclusion of South Sudan. In July 2011, during the course of Project implementation, South
Sudan was declared a sovereign state. South Sudan was then treated as another Project
beneficiary.

Reduction in Project cost. At appraisal, the Project cost and NBTF grant were US$7.1 million
and US$6.5 million, respectively, and at closure they were US$4.65 and US$4.35 million, as a
result of the change in implementation modality mentioned above. The undisbursed grant were
not lost for work on the NBI as this was returned to the NBTF, including to partially finance the
subsequent Nile Cooperation for Results (NCORE) Project.

Changes in the use of the grant proceeds. There were changes in the use of grant proceeds.
Grant proceeds originally allocated for the large consultancy were reallocated for smaller
consultancies, goods and equipment/workshops and training. Since a single category was stated in
the Grant Agreement, this did not require any reallocation.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Lessons of earlier operations were taken into account. Lessons learned from earlier activities on
the Nile Basin and other major international basins were incorporated in Project design. First,
strong emphasis was placed on the development of knowledge base and analytical capacity - good
information and analysis was considered essential for good investment planning. Second,
information sharing among riparian countries, which commenced before Project implementation
with the development of the Eastern Nile One-System Inventory, was considered as the first step
towards analytical work and riparian cooperation. Third, there was significant attention to the
participation of all riparian countries in the development of useful knowledge products and
analytical tools. And finally, the capacity of the Project management team was considered critical
to ensuring the development of useful products. An international workshop organized during
Project preparation to learn from other relevant projects and initiatives on transboundary river
basin also helped shaping Project design. An international consulting firm was engaged to help
prepare the project design document.



                                               14
Preparation adopted a participatory process. During the course of Project preparation, special
attention was devoted to engaging stakeholders to ensure their adequate input into Project design.
Stakeholder participation was initiated through a multi-sectoral regional working group that
guided Project design and preparation. There was substantial commitment to the project from
Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan, with letters of commitment, and also competing demands from
different riparians to have the regional coordination for this Project based in their country - that
was finally resolved with ENTRO and Bank facilitation.

Key risks were assessed. While the political risk was adequately recognized and discussed in the
PAD, no mitigating measure was identified to address the risk arising from the challenges of the
Nile Basin cooperation, which unfortunately materialized one year into Project implementation –
refer to Section 2.2. With the freeze in Egypt and Sudan participating in the regular governance
activities of the NBI, ENTRO was unable to perform its regular activities and processes smoothly
and efficiently. Despite several calls of ENTRO, a meeting of the ENCOM’s members to approve
the contract to engage the primary consulting firm to support the development of the regionally
shared modeling systems never took place. The flexible Project design (discussed below),
although not explicitly acknowledged in the risk section of the PAD, made it possible for ENTRO
to proceed with the immediate tasks and embark on the “Plan B? to achieve the planned project
objective and enhance technical capacity-building even in a difficult cooperation environment.
Apart from the political risk, which was rated substantial, the other identified risks were rated
moderate, and adequate mitigation measures to address them were provided.

Simplicity and flexibility were embedded in Project design. The simplicity in Project design
helped ENTRO keep a focus on implementation of Project activities. The flexibility embedded in
Project design was a critical factor to maintain its relevance. The Project was identified as one of
ENSAP fast-track project back in 2005 to act as a precursor of other NBI projects in the Eastern
Nile basin. There was a long delay between Project identification and appraisal because of the
difficulty in getting agreement among the riparian countries on the location of ENTRO’s ENPM
Coordination Office. In the meantime, other NBI projects (e.g. the Nile DSS, led by the former
ENPM Regional Coordinator) moved forward and carried out some of the knowledge base and
modeling activities that were supposed to be made available under the Project. This overlap
between the originally envisaged activities under Components A and B of the Project and those
undertaken by other projects was analyzed during the MTR and changes were introduced in the
original scope of activities under each component. The simple and flexible design allowed
accommodating the changes while staying focused on the PDO.

Opportunities to build technical capacity within ENTRO and promote gender balance were not
sufficiently explored during preparation. Most of ENTRO’s previous activities for a decade and
World Bank experience in other such projects relied on trying to procure large consultancies to
undertake such tasks. This was also consistent with the Nile DSS approach and ENTRO’s
procurement and technical capacity at preparation. However, with the benefit of hindsight, an
alternative “Plan B? approach seems to have been so appropriate that the Bank may have wanted
to have explore such an option right from the beginning - to build technical capacity within
ENTRO right from the start, rather than rely on a single large consulting contract to provide
implementation support to ENTRO. The difficulty in completing the procurement process of the
largest consultancy services under the Project, which led to the adoption of “Plan B?, was indeed
a blessing in disguise. With regard to gender balance, opportunities to promote gender equity
among ENTRO professional staff were also not explored. During the course of Project
preparation and implementation, professional positions at ENTRO (recruited with intense
competition from among the region’s professionals) were mostly filled by men. ENTRO did
eventually make special efforts to recruit more women as part of the internship program.

2.2 Implementation

Factors that contributed to success

Focus on results. The focus-on-results approach adopted throughout implementation by ENTRO
and the World Bank team was important for encouraging adaptive management while focused on
end objectives. The feedback offered by the large number of riparian stakeholders that
participated in the MTR workshops provided opportunities for modifying implementation
modality in a pragmatic manner to reflect the prevailing realities in the region and meet the PDO.
The focus-on-results attitude of key stakeholders participating in the Project helped the project
achieve concrete outcomes at closing.

Restructuring of ENTRO’s institutional structure. This was also a key factor that greatly
contributed to the success of the Project. The 2010 strengthening of the Water Resources
Planning Unit at ENTRO with highly technically qualified staff resulted in a paradigm shift in
ENTRO’s modus operandi moving away from relying heavily on external parties to deliver its
outputs to building in-house capacity to produce its analytical tools and knowledge products.
Apart from allowing institutionalizing the Project’s activities within the ENTRO’s Water
Resources Planning Unit, this shift also allowed senior staff at ENTRO to move away from heavy
work load associated with contract management to focus more on the development of technical
content.

Solid technical capacity, continuity and strong commitment of key Project management staff,
both on ENTRO and the Bank. The solid technical skills of the Head of ENTRO’s Water
Resources Planning Unit, the Regional Project Coordinators, and the Bank Task Team Leader,
their continuity, their strong commitment towards the Project, and their deep appreciation for
developing local capacity created mutual understanding and trust, which facilitated timely
resolution of implementation problems.

Built-in flexibility in Project design. The fact that the Project activities and implementation
arrangements were not over-specified in the grant agreement and the specification of only one
disbursement category avoided over-burdening both Bank and ENTRO implementation team with
administrative processes during the last year of implementation, and let them focus on delivering
Project results.

University partnerships and an innovative internship program increased ENTRO
implementation capacity. During the MTR, ENTRO was keen on strengthening linkages with
universities located in the Eastern Nile countries, in particular with the three universities with
which ENTRO had already signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) during Project
preparation. In spite of the prevailing regional cooperation tensions, Universities were very eager
to work across borders, and the network of Universities involved with ENPM grew from the
original 3 focal universities to include almost all the major universities in the region. A very
innovative feature was the introduction of a competitive paid internship program at ENTRO for
graduate students, young faculty, and ministry staff from all Eastern Nile countries (including
South Sudan after it was formed) to be resident at ENTRO in batches for a period of about 3
months each. This allowed ENTRO to tap into creative youth talent and cutting-edge skills in the
region, as well as offer them an opportunity to work together in teams across cultures and
contribute to the ENPM products. This innovative internship program was a cost-effective and
cost-efficient way to increase the capacity of ENTRO to deliver and disseminate the Project’s
knowledge and analytical products.


                                                16
Factors that caused implementation problems

Disagreements over the Nile Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA). In mid-2010,
disagreements related to a new water agreement for the Nile (the Cooperative Framework
Agreement) led to a “freeze? in participation of two of the three Eastern Nile countries in official
regional NBI activities, including this project 8. This impacted negatively on all NBI activities –
including this Project implementation. From mid-2010 onwards, ENTRO governance was not
able to meet effectively, there was a low participation from riparian country officials in Project
activities, hiring of country-based staff was delayed, and official representation in regional
workshops was very limited. Despite the difficult political situation, ENTRO was able to flexibly
sustain the Project activities, and in early 2012, the Project was able to rapidly scale-up
implementation in its final year after instituting the changes agreed during the MTR.

Overlapping with other NBI projects. As indicated earlier, due to long delay between
identification and appraisal, and then due to the slow start-up, other NBI projects moved forward
and carried out some of the knowledge base and modeling activities that were supposed to be
made available under the Project, often with different development philosophies and objectives.
Considerable time and effort were devoted to avoid duplication and improve synergy with the
Nile DSS. This in turn caused constantly revisions of the scope of work under the primary
consultancy, which impacted negatively on implementation.

ENTRO fiduciary capacity. The project implementation was also hampered by ENTRO’s
procurement capacity as their limited procurement staff were supporting several major
procurements in several ENTRO projects. Some final procurements related to satellite imagery
could not materialize in this context.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design. The M&E framework of the Project was based on the Results Framework and
Monitoring included in Annex 3 of the PAD. The M&E framework provided a list of outcome
indicators to measure achievement of the PDO as well as intermediate indicators and output
indicators to measure progress on each of the components. It also called for the use of
questionnaires and surveys (including on-line/web-surveys) to obtain regular stakeholder
feedback on Project’s progress and impacts as well as on Project activities. In general, the M&E
framework provided practical guidance for carrying out M&E of the Project and for measuring
progress towards achievement of PDO.

M&E implementation. ENTRO was responsible for the M&E of the Project. A dedicated
ENTRO M&E Officer was responsible throughout Project implementation of tracking Project
results and feeding the ENTRO’s results-based work planning, budgeting and reporting system.
Monthly, quarterly and annual reports were prepared focusing on results and financial resources
utilization. In addition, MTR and Project Completion Report (PCR) were prepared. M&E was
rated between Moderately Satisfactory and Satisfactory throughout Project implementation.
Upgrading during the final stage of Project implementation was due to notable improvements in




8
  While there was a “freeze? in participation, the countries did not officially withdraw from the NBI or
from ENTRO.


                                                     17
the quality of the reports. While the M&E system was in general good to monitor Project
progress, more could have been done in terms of getting feedback from stakeholders to gauge
Project implementation, assessing effectiveness of training and workshops and gathering
information from NBI institutions on the use of Project products. Stakeholder opinion surveys
were planned to be conducted but there were delays in their execution given the completion of
most products only near project closing.

M&E utilization. The M&E system was used by ENTRO management, ENTRO Project Team,
and the Bank Project Team to track Project implementation and results. While monthly progress
reports were disseminated within ENTRO for internal Project management, quarterly and annual
progress reports were also disseminated to all key stakeholders, including ENCOM and ENSAP
Team, for the purpose of information, accountability and learning. The Project was covered by
the NBI’s ENSAP’s dedicated website (http://nilebasin.org/newentro/ ) linked at a later stage to
ENTRO’s new website (http://entroportal.nilebasin.org/ ), which was developed under the Project
and disseminated Project activities and outputs.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards. The Project triggered the Environmental Assessment OP 4.01 safeguard policy and
was categorized as Environmental Assessment (EA) category C because neither environmental
nor social impacts were expected from the technical assistance activities to be supported by it.
Nonetheless, the PAD acknowledges that a Strategy for Addressing Environmental and Social
Safeguards (SAESS) was developed under the NBI Institutional Strengthening Project in 2008,
which would be applicable to all technical assistance projects that fall under NBI, including this
Project. Environmental compliance was monitored as part of the regular supervision missions,
and was rated satisfactory in Implementation Status and Results (ISRs) through the Project’s
period. Guidance on stakeholder consultation including in the SAESS were adopted to engage
stakeholders during the development of database and modeling tools. The assembled data and
developed tools would allow conducting meaningful stakeholder consultations and participatory
planning in the future.

Financial management. Financial management compliance has been rated Moderately
Satisfactory in ISRs throughout the Project period. The financial management system, including
accounting, reporting and auditing arrangements, was in general adequate and satisfactory to the
Bank. Quarterly Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) were submitted timely and were acceptable to
the Bank. The Project benefitted from a stable, adequate and well-trained financial management
staff in ENTRO. During early Project implementation, a problem was encountered with the
transfer of advance funds to national office to support country-based activities. This issue was
resolved immediately after notifying that all activities of the national offices with exception of the
operating costs needed to be centrally funded by ENTRO. Internal controls, however, remained a
challenge throughout Project implementation. Annual financial audited statements and associated
management letters were submitted for the periods 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 and had unqualified
opinions. The final audit of the Project financial statements for the period 2012/2013 will be
submitted in November 2013 together with the first audit of NCORE project. The rating was a
reflection of the low disbursement rate and low budget execution due to the initial delays with the
primary consultancy contract. Budget execution was affected by the regional freeze of Project
activities. Out of the NBTF grant amount of US$6.5 million, the Project was able to utilize
US$4.32 million (66%). In retrospective, the slow disbursement delay should not have influenced
financial management rating.



                                                 18
Procurement. Procurement compliance has been rated Moderately Satisfactory in ISRs
throughout the Project period. In general, procurement was acceptable to the Bank. The
procurement plan was in place from Project start, and was subject to various updates to
accommodate delays with main consultancy contract and reflect consultancy needs arising from
the new implementation modality agreed at MTR. ENTRO procurement staff was familiar with
Bank procurement procedures and was stable throughout implementation. Procurement processes
were organized following agreed procedures. The main consultancy service selection process was
completed after considerable delays, but the contract could not be concluded for reasons related
to the freeze of NBI activities, as well as changes in the scope of work. The Bank provided its no-
objection to ENTRO’s request to proceed with the cancelation of the process, which was cleared
by the Regional Procurement Advisor’s Office after 6 months. Two post-reviews were conducted..
The Project would have benefitted from additional procurement support at ENTRO to speed up
some of the procedures, particularly during the last year of Project implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Sustaining institutional capacity supported by the Project

As acknowledged in the PCR prepared by ENTRO, although the Eastern Nile region has a long
history of institutions working on various aspects of water resources development and
management, at the start of the Project, there was little in the way of a comprehensive knowledge
base for the Eastern Nile basin, and extremely limited information in the public domain.
Calibrated modeling toolsets that allow users to explore a range of development and management
issues that the Eastern Nile basin faced were not available in the public domain. There were no
effective partnerships among or across universities in each Eastern Nile country to work together
on water-related issues of regional interest. Although ENTRO had overseen many major
consultancies related to land and water management, its in-house capacity to organize, use, and
analyze information on Eastern Nile was very weak. The use of modern information technology
(IT) tools was limited and the ENTRO website provided little useful information. Eastern Nile
countries did not really look to ENTRO to provide the knowledge base and modeling services
they needed, especially to support decisions on water-related investments from a regional
perspective.

By mainstreaming Project activities within its institutional structure, ENTRO has been able to
develop an extensive in-house knowledge base and analytical skills. In addition, with financial
support from the Project, ENTRO has improved its IT hardware and software, acquired datasets
and books, improved communication and internet access, and re-organized its office space to
better serve its functions.

As indicated by key stakeholders interviewed by the ICR team and corroborated by the findings
of the stakeholder survey conducted after Project closure, there has been a dramatic change in
ENTRO’s capacity to develop and use knowledge and analytical products to support improved
planning and management of water resources in the Eastern Nile. The extensive knowledge base
developed has also improved the effectiveness and sustainability of previous technical assistance
projects aiming at improving the knowledge base and planning. The modeling and visualization
tools developed are being used by ENTRO to analyze a wide range of development, management,
and climate scenarios in a multi-sectoral context.

According to the feedback obtained during the course of Project implementation and after Project
closure, the Project has also facilitated strong partnerships with academic institutions in the
Eastern Nile countries that have helped establish better professional networks within and across

                                               19
countries, level the playing field, and improve research efficiency. This assessment was
corroborated by the Heads of Water Resources Departments of Ethiopia and Egypt universities
interviewed by the ICR team. They acknowledged that “this has been the first time face-to-face
partnership between African universities? has been fostered for such an effort. The equipment,
books, datasets, modeling tools, internship program, and capacity-building efforts should help
both country government agencies and universities to develop a new cadre of professionals that
are more cognizant of regional water resources development and management perspectives and
can utilize the best available datasets and tools on a more level playing field. The new ENTRO
web portal (expected to be scaled-up to the entire Nile Basin in the next year under the
framework of the NCORE project) has innovative features to improve public access to
information, tools, and knowledge products.

The knowledge base, knowledge products, and analytical tools developed with Project support
have been a valuable source of reference information for country professionals, and have inspired
and incentivized students that participated in the internship program to conduct inter-disciplinary
research as well as masters/doctorate thesis on issues related to Eastern Nile challenges. The
Project products are also expected to provide (and have already begun to provide) a valuable
source of information to professional consultants engaged by the country and regional institutions
to provide insights and advice on critical development challenges and proposed investments. For
example, this includes enhanced support to Sudan and Ethiopia on flood forecasting, to the Tana
and Beles Sub-basin organizations on knowledge products and basin planning, and modelling to
improve existing dam operations and climate resilience.

The efforts made by ENTRO and its partners with the help of the Project should help improve the
development of strong regional and country-level institutions and networks in the Eastern Nile
that have improved access to comprehensive knowledge bases and analytical tools that leverage
existing information and modern IT advances to improve regional cooperation. Thus, the
sustainability of the institutional capacity supported by the Project is not a major concern.

Progress made by the Project will be carried forward

There are a number of current and future activities that are carrying or will carry forward the
progress made under the Project. These include:

Supporting progress under the recently launched NCORE project. After the set of NBTF
projects in the Nile Basin came to a close in December 2012, the 3-year single NCORE project
has been launched for all NBI institutions to support progress towards achievement of the NBTF
projects’ goals. In the case of ENTRO, the NCORE project will support activities that can benefit
from, and build on, the achievements of the Project, namely refining the knowledge base and
analytical tools, updating IT platforms, strengthening the web portal, improving the flood
forecasting work, continuing the internship program and partnerships, enhancing the work on
climate change, environmental and social aspects, dam safety, and developing additional demand-
driven knowledge products and services. In addition, the NCORE project also proposes to expand
some of the good-practice activities initiated under the Project to a basin-wide context. This
would help ensure the short-term sustainability and enhancement of Project’s activities, and
contribute towards planning in the longer-term.

Integrating Project’s results in other initiatives. The work done with the support from the
Project has already been integrated with other ongoing NBI activities. For example, the ENTRO
worked closely with the Nile DSS team to co-locate and co-finance activities to improve the
effectiveness and sustainability of both activities. ENTRO has also worked to help integrate

                                                20
Project outputs into the Nile Information System and Knowledge Management activities, and also
synergize with other activities financed by a number of other development partners, e.g., the
Baro-Akobo-Sobat Multipurpose Development Project supported by the African Development
Bank, other activities relating to knowledge management and GIS financed by GIZ, and several
other proposed activities for the support of bilaterals such as the French, Swiss, and DFID.

Thus, even though the cooperation environment in the Eastern Nile continues to be very difficult
and uncertain, the products and approaches developed by ENTRO for ENPM should not only
help improve the cooperation environment through the desire for riparians to work together on
such areas for mutual benefit, but also continue to prove useful irrespective of the shape or
composition of the evolving cooperative institutions.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Project’s objective was highly relevant for the riparian countries. The development
objective of the Project that countries in the Eastern Nile develop an improved decision support
modeling framework to identify water-related investments and evaluate them in a regional
context was consistent with the development objectives of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan (pre-
independence of South Sudan), and their high level commitment to strengthen Eastern Nile
cooperation. Shared knowledge base and appropriate analytical tools to better support decision
making processes in the Eastern Nile were essential elements of such cooperation. The Project
was also consistent with the needs perceived by the riparians and the commitment made by the
Bank in its respective CASs and interim CWRASs of the Eastern Nile countries to provide a
framework for cooperative dialogue, planning and preparation of future regional investments.

The Project’s design and implementation were also highly relevant. The Project design was
technically sound and the three components were appropriately related to and consistent with the
stated PDO. As indicated in Section 2.1, its design reflected the experience of several other
international basins projects and programs. Preparation was carried out by the Bank in close
cooperation with the three riparian countries and ENTRO. With relation to the relevance of
implementation arrangements, the Project design called for mainstreaming of Project activities
within ENTRO. Consistent with this, the Project’s design should perhaps have put more emphasis
on doing more in-house work, rather than on heavy reliance on a large consultancy.
Implementation modality was modified at MTR along these lines. This change helped ENTRO
staff to move away from a traditional role of being contract managers of large consultancies to
actually doing most of the work themselves.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Progress towards achievement of PDO

To a significant extent, the Project achieved the PDO, as measured by the indicators defined at
appraisal:

Indicator 1: Number of projects in Eastern Nile for which investment strategies are based on
the ENPM analysis. The target was to have at least one major joint multipurpose/national
investments analyzed with Project’s products. This target was surpassed at the end of Project


                                              21
implementation. A range of joint multipurpose project options were analyzed using Project’s
tools. For example, many sizing and cascade versions of proposed Blue Nile mainstream dams
were analyzed 9 using the tools developed under the Project. A number of investments of national
significance were also analyzed in a regional context, wherever possible, related to irrigation,
watershed management, and power systems to contribute to the development of investments
strategies. ENTRO’s products and services are being used by the Africa Development Bank for
the appraisal of one of its projects. The Abbay Basin Authority and its branch offices of the Tana
Sub-Basin Organization and the Beles Sub-Basin Organization are also using ENTRO’s products
to improve sub-basin planning and management and have signed an MOU with ENTRO in this
regard with the Ethiopia Tana and Beles Integrated Water Resources Development Project. The
Project has also helped shape the design of the activities proposed under the NCORE project.

Indicator 2: Number of regional and national meetings facilitated by ENPM outputs. The
target for this indicator was to have at least one regional meeting and one meeting at each of the
riparian countries facilitated by Project’s outputs. This target was also surpassed by the revised
closing date. There have been a number of well-attended workshops organized at the regional
level (4) and at the national levels in Egypt (3), Ethiopia (1) and Sudan (2) facilitated with the
Project products. ENTRO plans to continue to use Project’s products in future workshops and in
engaging regional, country and development partner professionals.

Indicator 3: Number of senior professionals in regional/national institutions using ENPM
products. The target for this indicator was that at least four regional level professionals and two
professionals from each of the riparian countries were proficient in appropriate use of ENPM
system tools. This indicator was also surpassed at Project’s closing date. There are a number of
professionals working in NBI institutions that are using Project’s products. This includes the staff
of the Water Resources Planning Unit at ENTRO, the 46 graduate students and young faculties
involved in the internship program supported by the Project, faculty staff in key university in the
Eastern Nile including Heads of the Water Resources Engineering Departments, and government
professionals. In Sudan for example, the Ministry of Water regularly uses the flood forecasting
supported under the project to make decisions during flood periods, and is also exploring the use
of the RiverWare model to operate its Roseires dam. In Egypt, the Project’s activities and
products have created a new Eastern Nile modeling section in Cairo University, helped
universities better network together and have influenced the design of the curricula of water
resources management courses. In Ethiopia, the Project has improve the use of these tools for
flood management and basin planning in the Tana and Beles sub-basins, and the Project’s
products have helped influence the design of a new program on transboundary water management
has been introduced in the Institute of Water Resource.

Progress towards key intermediate performance indicators

The Project outcomes were also measured by four intermediate outcomes that assess
achievements in the three components.




9
  As usual with World Bank financing of technical assistance, the inclusion and examination of ongoing
and planned infrastructure in a study should in no way be construed as an endorsement of any particular
infrastructure projects by the World Bank, nor by any of the parties involved with the project, other than
where such projects have been specifically considered and expressly endorsed by the World Bank or any
such parties, such as through an actual project financing.

                                                     22
Achievements under Component 1 (Knowledge Base Development). Achievements under this
component were captured through the following intermediate indicator: Development of a shared
interactive Eastern Nile knowledge base and dissemination of a State of the Eastern Nile Report.
By closure, the Project helped develop a wide range of knowledge base and products on the
Eastern Nile. A wide range of multi-sectoral spatial layers were collated, computerized, quality
enhanced, and organized into GIS layers (see Figure 5). Systematic geo-databases were
developed for watershed management, power systems, and irrigation and drainage. Interactive
toolkits were developed to provide easy access to thematic and sub-basin information (see Figure
6). An annotated bibliography was developed for key documents on the Eastern Nile. An Eastern
Nile Atlas was developed to visualize the spatial diversity of the region. A State of the Eastern
Nile Report was also developed to describe the history, context, and future opportunities and risks
in the Eastern Nile. A modern interactive web portal was developed to provide enhanced access
to the Eastern Nile knowledge base and knowledge products. This platform for regional
cooperation provided by ENTRO is addressing the reluctance among Eastern Nile riparian
countries to share data and knowledge.

Achievements under Component 2 (Modeling System). Achievements under this component
were measured through the following intermediate indicator: Development of modeling tools to
systematically evaluate Eastern Nile investments in a regional context, examining economic,
environmental, and social aspects as allowed by available data. By closure, several modeling
tools were developed to provide analytical insights into the resource management and investment
options in the Eastern Nile. This included simulation, optimization, and multi-criteria tools to
examine proposed water investments in a multi-sectoral regional context (see Figure 7). A range
of reputed modeling tools were used to support analysis on the Eastern Nile – including Soil and
Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), the Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC) suite, River Basin
Simulation Model (RIBASIM), RiverWare, Mike Basin, and the Nile DSS framework. Efforts
were made to integrate economic, environmental, and social aspects in spite of the significant
limitations of the available data. The impacts of investments on sensitive downstream areas were
examined for varied scenarios of sizing, phasing, filling and operational strategies. Optimization
tools were developed to examine options to maximize the net benefits of basin development and
management. Flood forecasting tools were improved to help countries provide early warning to
vulnerable residents of flood-prone areas. Climate change analysis was conducted using a range
of the best available Global Circulation Model (GCM) outputs. Tools were developed and
targeted studies undertaken to improve the consideration of economic, environmental, and social
aspects. It is expected that such tools will continue to be refined in the future – immediate follow-
up work to refine the knowledge base and analytical tools and further encouragement for adoption
will be supported by the recently-launched NCORE project.

Achievements under Component 3 (Institutional and Human Capacity Building).
Achievements under this component were measured by two intermediate indicators: Strong
institutions at regional and national levels (in Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan) with adequate capacity
and partners (e.g. University Outreach Centers) to be a focal point for knowledge and analysis on
water investments on the Eastern Nile; and collaboration with the Nile DSS.

With regard to the first intermediate indicator, at the regional-level, the Project has helped
transform ENTRO into a credible center to provide regional knowledge and analytical services.
ENTRO now has the enabling skills, knowledge base, modeling tools, networks, partnerships,
and outreach mechanisms to be able to engage a wide variety of stakeholders to help them make
better informed decisions on issues and options that have regional significance. ENTRO’s
credibility as a provider of knowledge and analysis services has also improved tremendously. A
few indicators of this improvement are as follows. ENTRO’s services were used by the African
Development Bank in the preparation of a project on the Baro-Akobo-Sobat. South Sudan, who is
facing unique challenges in building capacity after several years of conflict, is currently looking
for ENTRO to help build its capacity on water resources management. Both the Tana Sub-Basin
Organization and the Beles Sub-Basin Organization are also using ENTRO’s services to improve
sub-basin planning and management. At the national-level, the Project has had mixed success. It
has helped developed excellent partnerships with universities in the Eastern Nile countries,
helping universities to establish better professional networks both within and across countries,
and to partner with a number of ENTRO activities, including training and workshops (see Figure
8). The internship program established has been pioneering, helping a new generation of potential
water professionals and leaders to acquire new skills, develop new regional collaborations, and
contribute multi-sectoral perspectives to enhance ENTRO’s knowledge and analytical services
(see Figure 9). The Project has also helped improve national government capacity through
provision of equipment and training; however, their full participation (especially in the case of
Egypt and Sudan) has been severely constrained by their freeze in participation in NBI activities.

Figure 8: Examples of Training and Workshops




Figure 9: Example of ENTRO Interns

With regard to the second intermediate indicator, a key concern during preparation was to
maximize the synergy between the overall Nile Basin analytical activities (particularly the Nile
DSS activity of the Water Resources Planning and Management project implemented by the Nile
Secretariat) and the Project implemented by ENTRO. Cooperation was very limited initially (e.g.
limited to sharing knowledge bases, co-locating activities in-country, and helping on each other’s
procurements) due to each project implementing a number of activities with separate multi-
country teams as planned on a very tight timeframe. However, as the Project’s activities really
picked up especially towards the closure, there was much more robust and meaningful
collaboration. This included co-financing key consultancies related to software development for
additional Nile DSS features, adapters for additional models to be added to the Nile DSS
framework, IT equipment and software to Eastern Nile countries, synergizing remote sensing
procurement, and synergy in training and capacity building. This has also helped the Nile
Secretariat and ENTRO to better agree on future knowledge, analysis, and partnership needs
under the new NCORE project.

3.3 Efficiency

The PAD indicates that the Project would contribute to the overall success of the ENSAP by
generating the necessary shared knowledge base and modeling tools and frameworks. Economic
benefits to be derived from the Project in the form of comprehensive information base, capacity
building and training, analytical tools, and stakeholder involvement, were found to be difficult to
quantify in monetary terms. Indeed, a cost-benefit analysis is not well suited to assess the impacts
of technical assistance and capacity building operations such as this operation due to the problems
in the quantification of intangibles and issues of attribution. The benefits of the Project, however,


                                                 26
include a number of economic, social and environmental gains and include both tangible and
intangible outcomes:

    •   Improving ease of access to critical information buried normally in difficulty-to access
        reports through well-organized knowledge base and interactive knowledge products and
        web portal,
    •   Developing a variety of models for analyzing a number of different themes and scenarios,
        to help make more informed decisions even on controversial investments.
    •   Improving university collaboration within and across countries
    •   Developing a new generation of water professionals (e.g. interns) in the region who have
        built strong friendships across countries, and appreciate each other’s’ viewpoints in a
        regional context. For example, Universities in Egypt informed the ICR team that many
        of their ENTRO interns returned from their short 3-month internships with a desire to do
        their masters’ or doctoral theses on regional issues relating to the Nile Basin.
    •   Improving information and tools in the public domain to help improve further analysis
        and decision-support on the basin
    •   Cutting the costs for future analyses – for example, during contract renegotiations with a
        large consultancy (eventually cancelled), ENTRO managed to negotiate down the cost by
        US$1 million just because they could now provide the information in-house instead of
        through a task in the Consultancy.
    •   Improving ENTRO’s credibility to provide knowledge and analytical services in the
        Eastern Nile region. The ENPM Project has helped ENTRO build better on previous
        work and rival any basin entity in Africa at least in terms of a well-organized detailed
        knowledge base, wealth of knowledge products, an impressive range of analytical tools,
        and helping foster a talented network of water professionals.

With regard to the cost-effectiveness of the Project, the PAD indicated that the Project costs
compare favorably to the initial phases of similar decision support systems in other parts of the
world and were expected to be well worth the investment given its expected impacts on designing
and selecting investment scenarios expected to cost billions of US dollars.

The Project achieved high efficiency since it was able to meet (or even surpass) targets by the
closing date with considerable cost savings in the amount of US$2.45 million (estimated project
cost at appraisal was US$7.10 million and actual Project cost at closure was US$4.60 million)
through the use of smaller consultancy contracts and the implementation of the internship
program. Even if the overall costs incurred by the Bank during preparation and supervision are
taken into account, the significant outputs listed in Annex 2, were obtained at a relative modest
costs of US$5.31 million.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The outcome of the ENPM Project is rated satisfactory based on its significant achievements,
high relevance, the satisfactory rating given to its efficacy, and since it achieved the intended
development objective by the closing date.




                                               27
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

The Project activities created limited opportunities for employment, income generation, and
poverty reduction. However, it is expected that potential follow-up investments in the Eastern
Nile would provide greater opportunities for increased employment, which in turn would have
positive impacts on poverty reduction.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

As indicated in Section 2.5, the long-term capacity and institutional development included the
improvement of the knowledge base and analytical capacity at ENTRO and Eastern Nile
countries and the strengthening of networks among Eastern Nile universities. The internship
program has helped young water professionals in the region to network with each other and to
contribute new perspectives to old and evolving challenges. All these will contribute to riparian
countries to envision alternative development scenarios; assess their economic, environmental
and social impacts from a regional perspective; and make informed decisions over the use of the
Eastern Nile.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The Project has resulted in several unintended impacts. ENTRO has become more interested in
building in-house capacity, networking young professionals in the region, putting more
information in the public domain, and develop a more service orientation to its clients. The
information base quality and insights have improved significantly as many public-domain and
commercial models have been used together. ENTRO has been able to attract attention for
collaboration from many agencies – e.g. MOUs have been already signed with UNESCO-IHE
and the Ethiopia Tana and Beles Integrated Water Resources Development Project and the Abbay
Basin Authority and several Universities. A delegation from Malawi recently visited ENTRO
and wishes to have follow-up collaboration as they embark on basin planning exercises in the
Shire basin. Technical papers are being submitted in journals based on the ENPM tools and the
knowledge base and tools are better informing debates on development paradigms. Universities
have indicated that they have stronger networks not only across countries but also within
countries as a result of the ENPM workshops and internship programs. The internship programs
are now intensely competitive as compared to early batches.
Although the Project intended to support basic activities relating to information and analytical
tools and capacity development, it is now easier to see the role its activities could have in
addressing the larger critical information, institutional, and investment issues that the countries of
the Eastern Nile face in the pursuit of their shared goals of socio-economic development and
environmental and natural resources management. As indicated in the PCR prepared by ENTRO,
the work initiated under the Project has contributed to address most of these critical challenges, as
shown in Table 3.

   EN Challenge                  How the ENPM Project has Helped Address the Challenge
                     • A comprehensive knowledge base has been developed for the first time on the
                       Eastern Nile Basin, which has already proved invaluable to support a number of
                       different modeling and other analytical efforts to provide insights into other key
                       challenges that the basin faces.

                     • Internship program involving graduate students and young faculty in the key
                       universities of the Eastern Nile has contributed to develop more systematic
                       knowledge base and to disseminate and use such knowledge.
                     • ENTRO web portal has enhanced public access and use of the knowledge base and
                       products created with the support of ENPM.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

The PCR prepared by ENTRO summarizes the feedback received from Project implementation
partners and users of Project products on three dimensions: knowledge base, analytical tools and
stakeholder partnerships. This summary is presented in Annex 5. The feedback received indicates
that the Project was able to meet its objective and stakeholders using the products and services
provided by ENTRO were very satisfied.

A qualitative assessment of the impacts of this Project and the First Joint Multi-purpose Program
Identification (JMP1-ID) project was gathered though a survey conducted at the NCORE project
launch workshop involving approximately 40 participants. Findings of this survey are also

                                                  31
presented in Annex 5. The main conclusions of the qualitative assessment in relation to the
ENPM Project are summarized below.

Achievement of PDO. The evaluation found the Project had been able to achieve its development
objective. The survey asked participants how strongly they agreed with the statement that the
Project has met its objectives: 28% gave a “strongly agree? response, 38% gave an “agree?
response and 28% gave an “average? response. Only three respondents indicated that the
development objective was not met, and five did not know.

Contribution of recent activities carried out by ENTRO. In relation to the recent activities
conducted by ENTRO, the evaluation found the majority of interviewed stakeholders were
satisfied with ENTRO’s contribution towards the goal of NBI. Participants were asked to express
their agreement with the contribution of the recent activities carried out by ENTRO (with the
support from the Project and the JMP1-ID project) to address key challenges in the Eastern Nile:
95% gave an “average? or better response to the contribution to develop a common vision for the
Eastern Nile, 98% to build capacity for basin-wide development and management and more
efficient use of Eastern Nile resources, 93% to increase awareness about Eastern Nile issues and
the need to jointly develop and use the common resources of the Eastern Nile for the benefit of all,
95% to generate knowledge products and modeling tools for better development and management
of Eastern Nile resources, 98% to strengthen the capacity of ENTRO to provide technical
knowledge helpdesk services to other regional and national institutions, and 88% to strengthen
the capacity of ENTRO to facilitate regional-scale land and water investments.

Assessment of products and services delivered by ENTRO. In relation to the products and
services delivered by ENTRO, the evaluation found the majority of interviewed stakeholders
were satisfied. Participants were also asked to assess the products and services delivered by
ENTRO: 95% gave an “average? or better response to the comprehensive knowledge base and
knowledge products of the Eastern Nile (e.g., systematic geo-database; watershed management,
power and irrigation interactive thematic toolkits; interactive sub-basin toolkits; ENTRO web
portal; Eastern Nile Atlas and Eastern Nile State of the Basin Report), 95% to the public domain
modeling tools (e.g., soil and water analysis model of the Eastern Nile, Hydrological Engineering
Center Reservoir System Simulation (HEC-ResSiM) Eastern Nile system simulation model), 95%
to the commercial modeling tools (Riverware model of the Blue Nile, RIBASIM of the Abay-
Blue Nile, and MIKE-BASIN model of the Nile Basin), 95% to the internship program supported
by the Project, 95% to the Project national and regional capacity building activities (including
workshops, training and IT support), and 88% to informing regional dialogue on strategic water
resources, planning, development and management. Respondents also provided concrete
recommendations to enhance the quality of the products and services, namely, to update database
and model inputs, and review model results; to communicate the reliability of model results; to
establish a policy for sharing knowledge products and analytical tools; to make the models more
affordable; to include all Eastern Nile universities in the follow-up internship program and
expand it to also cover other institutions; and to disseminate further the modeling products
through technical training sessions.

Long-lasting benefits. The evaluation found a strong belief among interviewed stakeholders that
the Eastern Nile institutions will benefit from the Project. Participants responded that the Eastern
Nile institutions will benefit from the various products and services delivered under the Project:
61% gave a “strongly agree? response, 34% gave an “agree? response and 5% gave an “average?
response.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

There have been a number of achievements of the Project in establishing a comprehensive
knowledge base, developing a number of analytical tools, and reaching out to interested
stakeholders. These achievements have helped strengthen ENTRO’s role as a regional knowledge
services provider, as well as helped make information become available in the public domain for
other professionals to build upon. While most of the Project’s activities were designed and
implemented keeping in mind sustainability considerations, there are a few issues that need to be
considered to ensure the sustainability of the Project outcomes over the long-term. Given the
recently launching of NCORE project, there is a good reason to hope that ENTRO’s enhanced
capacity will be sustained in the mid-term.
At present, ENTRO has the best available comprehensive knowledge base assembled on the
Eastern Nile. However, if the knowledge base is not continuously updated to reflect stakeholder
feedback, demands placed on ENTRO’s knowledge and analytical services as well as additional
reports and datasets that are created and/or developed for the Eastern Nile, then, the knowledge
base would become obsolete and irrelevant. ENTRO has to have the necessary technical
staff/skills/partnerships to keep the knowledge base updated.

Similarly, the set of analytical tools developed at ENTRO to address the various issues that are
critical to the Eastern Nile will need to be continuously updated to reflect the rapidly-evolving set
of modern tools. In order to do this, ENTRO has to have the necessary staffing and skills to stay
on top of the new developments in water-related models and build additional partnerships with
relevant regional organizations as well as with other basin organizations.

Similarly, efforts to implement the IT strategy and policy that lays out a vision for a sustainable
information technology framework at ENTRO need to continue so ENTRO is able to adapt to the
rapidly changing IT world. In order to do that, ENTRO needs to have the adequate skills and
financial resources to make the needed investments in videoconferencing to improve interaction
within NBI institutions and development partners and be able to conduct effective distance
learning.

Given the limited participation of Eastern Nile country government professionals during Project
implementation (due to the status of regional cooperation), ENTRO needs to enhance interaction
with country government professionals to ensure that they have access, use, and contribute to
refinement of the knowledge base and analytical tools developed. The sustainability of this
project’s activities are also enhanced by the partnerships developed among Universities and
young professionals in the region, and these would also need to be further nurtured.
In order to sustain outcomes, ENTRO would require continued financing, which has to be done in
a difficult regional environment. Such financing would need to come from the NBI/ENTRO
member states as well as development partners. The Nile Council of Ministers decided in July,
2012 to emphasize member country commitment to maintain minimum functionality of the NBI.
There would be a need for additional country commitment to finance their Government agencies
to better interact with ENTRO to use the Project outputs. Universities have been excellent
partners on the Project and it is expected that their work on the networks they have developed
will actually help them access additional resources to build on the Project work. While the
NCORE Project will extent support to ENTRO during the next three years, there will be a need to
evolve a strategy to ensure ENTRO’s financial sustainability after this project comes to an end.

5. Assessment of Bank and Grantee Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank performance during preparation of the Project is rated moderately satisfactory. The
Bank team had expertise and experience in preparing the Project and had a very good relationship
with the NBI institutions. The Bank knowledge on major international basins and previous
operations in the Nile Basin were well used to shape the design of this operation. The Bank team
put to good use lessons learned regarding Project’s design simplicity and flexibility. As noted in
Sections 2.3 and 3.1, the Bank team did a good job in identifying key Project components, which
were fully aligned with the PDO, and the key elements of the M&E framework. The challenges in
the Eastern Nile basin were well understood by the Bank team.
A key Project design weakness was the heavy reliance placed on the large consultancy contract to
develop most of the knowledge products and deliver the technical assistance. To reflect on the
priority need in capacity building, more emphasis would have been given on the use of short-term
advisors or consultants to assist ENTRO in the delivery of in-house products. Given the initial
limited management capacity within ENTRO to manage a different modality to deliver the
technical assistance through so many consultants, the Bank team was constrained to pursue a
large consultancy. The restructuring that took place at ENTRO during early phase of Project
implementation and the strengthening of its leadership provided the enabling environment to
adopt a different implementation modality. Of course, in retrospect, it may have been more
desirable for ENTRO to be equipped with the right leadership and coordination skills from the
start. Similarly, it may have been desirable (even though difficult in the governance environment
of ENTRO) to have the proposed primary ENPM consultant selected, and strong ENPM user
networks in place prior to project implementation to facilitate a smooth start.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank performance in supervision is rated satisfactory. The Bank supervision missions were
regular, instrumental in identifying critical problems, and according to the interviewed ENTRO
staff, added value. Missions were all led by the same Task Team Leader, who was involved in the
conceptualization and preparation of the Project. Supervision missions were also effective as
learning tools because mission members made strong efforts to undertake training at ENTRO and
disseminate knowledge, and representatives from various institutions participating in missions
were also able to take back new insights and lessons learned. The Bank team worked very closely
and effectively with ENTRO counterparts and showed flexibility in modifying implementation
modality at MTR to adjust to the changing political situation. This was critical for achieving
results. Bank team members located in Addis Ababa also added value to the overall management
of the Project. Proximity to ENTRO allowed closer monitoring and intensive on-the-ground
implementation support, and also helped create trust.
When Project implementation was lagging, the Bank team identified alternative financial sources
(including a grant from the Integrated Land, Water and Climate Trust Fund in the amount of
US$500,000) to hire selective expertise to support ENTRO’s efforts to compensate for the lack of
progress with the technical assistance activities to be supported by the Project. The Bank team
also mobilized support from the Bank Africa Spatial Help Desk to build the capacity of ENTRO
staff and interns in using modern global datasets, earth observation and climate products, and a
range of innovative visualization and interactive tools and knowledge products.

                                               34
One shortcoming in supervision not attributed to the Bank team but to the Bank system in general,
was the slow response (6 months for the Regional Procurement Advisor’s Office clearance) to
ENTRO’s request to cancel the procurement process for the selection of the main consultancy.

Another shortcoming during supervision not attributed to the Bank team but to the Bank
management was the inability to extend the Project beyond December 2012 when a large portion
of the grant was still undisbursed, particularly when the NBTF’s closing date was extended until
end-2014. One year extension would have allowed strengthening and consolidating the Project’s
achievements with the available funds. Bank management decided to close all NBI projects by
December 2012.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall performance of the Bank is assessed as satisfactory. The Bank team had a large role
in supporting ENTRO in turning the Project around and making it a success. The limitation
observed in the quality at entry caused some delays in implementation but had marginal impacts
on the achievement of the PDO.

5.2 Grantee Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

In this particular Project, the “Government? should be understood to include the ENTRO, the
recipient of the NBTF grant, and the Eastern Nile countries represented through the ENCOM.
The combined performance of the ENTRO and the ENCON is rated moderately satisfactory.

The performance of ENTRO during preparation and implementation as described in section 5.2
(b) is rated satisfactory. The significant improvements in its technical capacity and the
mainstreaming of Project activities within its own structure are testaments to the commitment that
the ENTRO afforded to this Project.

The performance of the ENCOM during preparation is rated moderately unsatisfactory. While
water ministries staff from Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan provided inputs into the design of the
Project, and were effective in mobilizing stakeholders to shape Project design, their lack of
consensus on the location of the regional coordination for the Project caused Project preparation
to stall for almost two years. Their performance during implementation is also rated moderately
unsatisfactory, namely because of the freeze of the participation of Egypt and Sudan in NBI
activities that limited government official participation in key ENPM Project activities. It also
resulted in a considerable delay in implementation, which as indicated in section 2.1 was a
blessing in disguise as new knowledge networks emerged and ENTRO’s internal capacity was
strengthened. This also impacted on the ability of two out of the three riparian countries to fulfill
their counterpart funds obligations. During the implementation period, Ethiopia was the only
country to meet its annual contribution to ENTRO.




                                                 35
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The implementing agency for this Project was ENTRO. The performance of ENTRO responsible
for the Project is rated satisfactory during preparation and implementation. ENTRO, with the
support from the Eastern Nile universities were fully committed to the Project from the
conceptualization stage, and were instrumentals in its successful implementation. At the design
stage, ENTRO had conceived the Project to be implemented through a semi-integrated project
implementation unit, partially using its existing structures. The reorganization that took place in
ENTRO during the early phase of implementation improved considerably the performance of the
Project by institutionalizing Project activities within its evolving structure and by putting
excellent technical experts from its Water Planning Unit in charge of the Project. ENTRO
focused its activities towards achieving the PDO and played a very active role in coming out with
an alternative implementation modality to provide technical support. ENTRO also strived to
maintain a balanced composition within its internship program by involving interns from each of
the riparian countries including South Sudan.

A few shortcomings were noted in the M&E system. Although ENTRO had the capacity to
implement the M&E system as originally designed, no much was done in terms of obtaining
regular feedback from Project’s beneficiaries on Project products and services to gauge
implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Grantee Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall performance of the Grantee is assessed as moderately satisfactory. Despite the
shortcomings presented in section 5.2 (a), ENTRO provided unconditional and high quality
leadership and its performance was remarkable. The adjustments on the implementation modality
introduced after the MTR allowed ENTRO to partially make up for delayed implementation of
Project activities, delivered on commitments, and achieved overall outcomes by closure.


6. Lessons Learned

The ENPM Project design and implementation experiences have resulted in a wealth of
experiences that could be useful not only for future work in the Nile Basin but in other river
basins across the world. Some of these (as corroborated in the PCR) are indicated below:

What Worked Well?

Flexible Design: One of the key lessons that this project illustrated was the need to have a project
design that focus on end goals and not be too rigid in the implementation modalities to achieve
these. For example, although regional tensions and the environment for cooperation grew
difficult during project implementation, it was possible to achieve the project objectives, key
indicators, and even surpass most of the indicator targets in the results framework. This was done
through adaptive management where ENTRO worked with the Bank to change implementation
arrangements from the reliance on a large consultancy to doing more in-house work.



                                                36
“Plan B? can sometimes be better than “Plan A?: When the ENTRO governance was not able
to meet for over 2 years to approve the large planned consultancy under the original plan (“Plan
A?), the choice was clear – either to close the project or try another implementation modality. A
“Plan B? was developed to try and achieve the project goals through an alternate implementation
modality of in-house consultants, interns, university partnerships, and specialized smaller firm
consultancies. In the end, it turned out that this new plan was probably much better than the
previous plan as it helped ENTRO professionals to move from being contract managers of a large
consultancy to actually doing most of the work in-house. It also helped build much stronger links
with academia, and develop a wider range or knowledge products. It also helped ENPM to
become better institutionalized within ENTRO and contribute better to other ENTRO activities
(e.g. related to flood forecasting and the Joint Multipurpose Program).

Working Closer with Academia: A key lesson learned has been that, in complex river basins
with largely entrenched government positions, it is critical to broaden the stakeholder pool for
engagement. For a knowledge-driven project such as the ENPM, it was always useful to involve
academia. The ENPM project had proposed to have close working relationships with one focal
University in each of the three target Eastern Nile countries (Addis Ababa University, Khartoum
University, and Cairo University). After initial interactions with these universities and gauging
their strong interest in working together on technical issues relating to the Eastern Nile, ENTRO
decided to expand this network to include all the key technical universities in the Eastern Nile
countries through these three focal universities. This has resulted in unexpected benefits in the
form of improved interaction of technical Universities within the Eastern Nile countries, as well
as drawing from a wide pool of candidates for ENTRO internships. The internship program
initiated by ENPM Project has been extremely useful both to help the interns acquire new skills,
regional perspectives, and collaboration, as well as to help ENTRO develop a wide range of
knowledge and modeling products and better disseminate ENPM Project outputs. Based on this
experience, the NBI has decided to expand such academic partnerships and internships to all the
countries of the Nile Basin in future activities.

Focus on the Public Domain: Often, such projects support the development of high-quality
multi-sectoral knowledge bases, modeling tools, and technical reports. However, these often
remain accessible only by a select few, and new researchers and technical specialists have to
often start from scratch. Also, it is quite surprising that even in complex river basins such as the
Nile with entrenched political positions, so little information and insights even on basic critical
issues and options relating to the basin are easily accessible to the general public. ENTRO used
the ENPM Project framework to develop versions of key datasets, interactive knowledge products,
reports, and modeling tools that could be shared in the public domain. This has been facilitated
by the web portal, university partnerships, internships, and workshops. This should help not only
provide the general public with access to the best available data, tools, and insights on the basin,
but also help current and future researchers to improve the quality of these products and build
further on this work.

One Model or Several? A key decision that has to be made when embarking on the analysis of a
basin as complex as the Eastern Nile is to decide which modeling framework should be utilized.
One school of thought is to use only one model to avoid the situation if different models give
different results. This is often useful in the case of using one shared operational tool (e.g.
forecasting, systems simulation) or for allocations for legal purposes in a mature cooperation
setting. However, in this case, ENTRO decided to use multiple models given the fact that the
issues being analyzed were very varied in the Eastern Nile (e.g. erosion management, flood
forecasting, irrigation systems, power systems, reservoir filling and operations, wetland
management, climate change, etc.) and no one model was available to address all these issues

                                                37
satisfactorily. This allowed ENTRO to use different reputed models for the ENPM Project and
use the results to cross-verify results; although there was little real difference in basic model
outputs (as the laws of physics have to always be met given that they utilize the same knowledge
base for setup and calibration), this allowed for the use of specialized “fit-for-purpose? tools,
improve partnerships with academia and technical interns (who worked on a range of tools), and
be ready to explore new tools being created in a rapidly-evolving marketplace. The ENPM
Project also helped the Nile DSS to build adapters for additional models to expand the repertoire
of models that could be used with the overall Nile DSS framework.

Variety in Knowledge Products: For effective communication of complex issues in the Eastern
Nile and change entrenched mindsets, it is critical that information be communicated in
customized ways to target different stakeholders. A lesson in the ENPM implementation is to try
to develop a range of knowledge products to help better interface with each stakeholder group.
For example, the project helped ENTRO develop products for a non-technical audience to quickly
grasp key issues and options (e.g. the Eastern Nile Atlas, the Eastern Nile State of the Basin
Report, and the Eastern Nile in a Changing Climate). Interactive visualization products were also
developed to help different types of stakeholders interact at their pace and per their interest (e.g.
the interactive One System Inventory, an Interactive Web Portal, animation and interactive PDF
products, etc.). For those more technically inclined, a range of innovative knowledge products
were developed that could be used both with and without specialized software (e.g. GIS datasets,
Google Earth overlays, interactive spreadsheet toolkits, calibrated models, multi-criteria and other
modeling results visualization tools, etc.).


What Could Have Been Done Better?

Project Readiness: The initial slow start of the project could be attributed to many reasons that
provide many lessons in hindsight. One is to have ENTRO work closely with the Bank to have
major procurements (e.g. the primary ENPM consultancy) ready with the necessary clearances on
both sides (e.g. from ENTRO governance) well in advance of project start. Another is to improve
the links with potential users of the ENPM systems even before project start.

Engaging Potential Partners Early: It is often difficult to effectively engage potential users of
knowledge and analytical systems without something to show initially. If early efforts are done
to pilot the knowledge base and tools, it would be easier to attract a range of potential users and
keep them engaged throughout the process. For example, in this Project, after initial discussions
displaying the work ENTRO had done in-house, it was easier to attract interest from Universities
and other knowledge partners. Synergy was also explored with overall NBI through discussions,
coordination, and co-financing of activities of the ENPM with the Nile DSS, even though each
was being implemented in tight timeframes by different groups. In the future, ENTRO could also
use the project outputs to build better relationships with Non-governmental and Civil Society
Organizations (perhaps through federations such as the Nile Basin Discourse) and also with other
Research Networks that exist in the Basin. This will help ensure enhanced dissemination for
more informed dialogue, as well as feedback and suggestions for future work by ENTRO on
knowledge and analytical products. Efforts also need to be made to improve interactions with
government agencies where there is interest and to stimulate interest where not. Efforts could
also be made to use such projects to build national capacity more directly where required and
requested (e.g. there could be opportunities especially in countries such as South Sudan in this
regard).



                                                 38
Need for a Programmatic Approach: Given that the work related to development of multi-
sectoral knowledge bases, analytical tools, and stakeholder frameworks to support planning and
management of water resources in areas like the Eastern Nile will never be completed, there is a
need to conceive and implement such activities in a longer-term programmatic framework. The
ENPM was conceived as a three year project, in which most of the work ended up being done
primarily in the final project year given the governance issues that plagued its implementation.
At the end of the project, it is now really at a stage where many of the activities could be (and
need to be) scaled up, building on the new credibility and capacity that ENTRO has in providing
knowledge and analytical services. These could include more direct helpdesk support to country
governments, an expanded internship program and university linkages, a systematic annual
modeling forum, training workshops and distance learning programs, partnerships with other
basins and global knowledge providers, web portal enhancement, developing shared hydromet
visualization platforms, addressing additional critical areas on the Eastern Nile (e.g. seasonal
forecasting, wetland management, developing additional datasets including primary data
collection to support triple-bottom line analysis), more effective use of evolving IT advances (e.g.
improved use of earth observation products, cloud computing, mobile apps, newer modeling
suites, videoconferencing), scholarships, study tours, and developing a new generation of
knowledge products customized to different stakeholders. Very few of these have been included
in the next NBI project (NCORE) and there is still substantial need for financing to maintain
ENTRO’s momentum in these activities to provide enhanced services to its stakeholders and not
lose its in-house skills. All this calls for a more flexible, longer-term programmatic framework to
conduct such knowledge and analytical capacity building activities.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component A: Information Management and System Development (Actual cost US$1.05
million or 23% of total Project cost)

Development of ENTRO Database. The ENTRO database has been developed to handle both
spatial and non-spatial datasets collected and compiled from different ENSAP projects. The
central database has two separate databases (spatial and non-spatial), which are logically linked.
It can also import datasets from the Nile DSS. The spatial database has been built using enterprise
spatial database engine technology for systematically organizing and handling bio-
physical/environmental and, socio-economic datasets of the Eastern Nile. The non-spatial
database is developed to organize and store time-series hydro-meteorological, characteristic and
parameter datasets, which are logically linked to the spatial datasets. Data series and applications
that feed into ENTRO web portal such as web mapping and time series model data manager are
stored in this database. It is expected that these datasets will be enhanced and improved in quality
over time depending on evolving analysis needs.

Development of ENTRO Web Portal. ENTRO’s web portal has been developed to help organize,
store and disseminate information and knowledge products related to the socio-economic and
environmental conditions of the Eastern Nile. It is categorized into an internal portal (Intranet),
running in a server hosted at ENTRO’s physical premises (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia), and external
web portal, constituting a subset of the internal portal’s content. The portal has interactive web
interfaces which enable users to navigate through ENTRO’s available resources and download its
wide range of data, documents and maps. The web portal manages documents, images, videos,
maps and other application files using a database management system. In general, the web portal
serves as a repository for knowledge bases developed under different ENTRO projects and
collected from other projects in an organized fashion, and as an interface for accessing these
knowledge bases. The tools also allow users to produce maps based on global time-series,
remotely sensed weather data from NASA and other such public domain sources. The portal is
also comprised of a resources center that enable users to search and download data, information
and knowledge products such as project based factsheets, posters, documents, images, maps, MS
Excel based toolkits, and others. The toolkits available through the portal are interactive and
allow users to extract sub-basin level information, focusing in on a singular aspect or more of the
social characteristics, environmental conditions, economic features and institutional aspects of the
Eastern Nile region, based on the user’s preference.

Development of Remote Sensing Analytical tools and Products. Remote sensing products at
ENTRO are derived from publicly available global datasets; e.g., Moderate-resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS), land cover, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
time series. The land cover classification scheme is based on the global International Geosphere
Biosphere Program (IGBP) and produced at 0.5 kilometer pixel resolution. Land cover classes are
assigned by processing the 32-day spectral database using decision tree and artificial neural
network classifiers trained by ground data. ENTRO remote sensing data will be used as
background for mapping, and analysis related to: land cover data and land cover change
information (including changes in urbanization, cropped areas, desertification, forest cover, etc.),
NDVI, evapotranspiration, Nile morphology and change at certain reaches, change detection of
parks, agricultural encroachments to forest land, erosion assessment using remote sensing data,
and satellite altimetry for lake level heights, changes in wetlands, as well as rainfall estimation,
flood extent estimation.


                                                41
Geospatial System Development. ENTRO has organized spatial data into systematic
geodatabases, including an extensive set of metadata for existing spatial datasets, support for
development of customized mapping products (Eastern Nile Atlas), spatial analysis and spatial
products (e.g. animations, interactive PDFs). Metadata of the Eastern Nile is available for the
following parameters: administration, climate, geology, hydrography, land cover, soils,
demographics, economy, health, education, irrigation, dams and hydropower plants, power
interconnection, transport and communication. Data was collected from public domain datasets,
country level feasibility studies and master plans, Cooperative Regional Assessments (CRA)
conducted by ENTRO as well as other ENTRO studies and documents.

Thematic Toolkits. ENTRO has developed a number of technical thematic toolkits to collate
available information and provide analytical tools in an easy-to-use interactive setting that does
not need special software and uses advanced Microsoft Excel functionality. It is expected that
these toolkits would be refined and evolve over time as they are used. These toolkits include:

        o   Watershed Management Toolkit: This toolkit builds on earlier ENTRO work on
            watershed management cooperative regional assessment and includes available
            information on erosion and sedimentation in the Eastern Nile, schematics of sediment
            contribution of various tributaries, as well as a roster of watershed management
            measures and their implications.
        o   Power Toolkit: This toolkit builds on the extensive work carried out under the Power
            Trade CRA and includes information on power demand trends, power supply options
            in the Eastern Nile, detailed available information for each major existing and
            proposed hydropower site, and tools to support analysis of power systems.
        o   Irrigation Toolkit: This toolkit builds on the work of the Irrigation and Drainage
            CRA and includes detailed information on all existing and proposed irrigated
            agriculture areas, cropping patterns, and tools for economic and technical analysis of
            irrigation investments

Sub-Basin Toolkits. ENTRO has developed a number of technical sub-basin toolkits to collate
available information and provide analytical tools in an easy-to-use interactive setting that does
not need special software and uses advanced Microsoft Excel functionality. It is expected that
these toolkits would be refined and evolve over time as they are used. These toolkits include:

        o   Blue Nile Toolkit: This toolkit integrates key existing information on the Blue Nile
            (Abbay) sub-basin and includes clickable schematics of the basin with key
            information related to its basin characteristics, hydrology, and water structures.
        o   Baro-Akobo-Sobat Toolkit: This toolkit integrates key existing information on the
            Baro-Akobo-Sobat sub-basin and includes clickable schematics of the basin with key
            information related to its basin characteristics, hydrology, and water structures.
        o   Tekeze Toolkit: This toolkit integrates key existing information on the Tekeze sub-
            basin and includes clickable schematics of the basin with key information related to
            its basin characteristics, hydrology, water structures, and other features.
        o   Main Nile Toolkit: This toolkit integrates key existing information on the Main Nile
            sub-basin and includes clickable schematics of the basin with key information related
            to its basin characteristics, hydrology, water structures and other features.

Knowledge Products. A brief description of the key knowledge products developed by the Project
is provided below:

       o   Eastern Nile Atlas: This Atlas provides a snapshot of the Eastern Nile, its climate,
           resources, and environment, social and economic characteristics. The Atlas aims to
           strengthen the Eastern Nile knowledge base and promote better understanding of
           shared resources. It also strives to enhance resource planning tools and analysis by
           reconciling maps of the sub-basin with pertinent information. By increasing the
           understanding of climate, resources, environment, social and economic
           characteristics of the Eastern Nile, policy makers would be in the position of making
           informed decisions about the future use of shared resources and increasing public
           domain data about the Eastern Nile.

       o   Eastern Nile State of the Basin Report: The Eastern Nile State of the Basin Report is
           a non-technical document that provides strategic overview of the Eastern Nile key
           issues. The report focuses on the big development challenges in the Eastern Nile
           basin, and addresses the transboundary water resources development and
           management issues from the view of promoting and facilitating economic growth,
           reducing poverty and food in-security; and enhancing social wellbeing. The report
           represents a compilation of existing knowledge that looks at historical water
           management and development, current practices and looks ahead at the water
           development opportunities and potentials and the main obstacles to these possibilities.

       o   Eastern Nile in a Changing Climate Report: This report addresses climate risks in the
           Eastern Nile. It encompasses a review of historical climate risks in the Eastern Nile,
           examination of future climate change scenarios, their implications and coping
           strategies to improve climate resilience

User Manuals. Several user manuals were developed under the Project, including the following:
SWAT, River Ware, RIBASIM, Mike Basin, Nile-DSS, Web Portal, and Eastern Nile Multi-
purpose Optimization System (ENMOS).

Special Studies. Several special technical studies were initiated under the Project, and were
implemented by academia and professionals of Eastern Nile universities (Addis Ababa University,
Khartoum University, and Cairo University). Each university investigated two issues that were of
significance at a national level. The following areas of research were addressed through these
special studies:

       o   Nile Delta Flooding due to Sea Level Rise (SLR) (Cairo University): The study
           investigated scenarios for SLR in the Nile Delta to better understand the associated
           impacts on existing coastal systems, infrastructure and property, and to identify high
           risk areas that are prone to high impact. An inundation model was developed using
           GIS that accounts for connectivity with the sea or lakes. The main input to the
           inundation model is a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In the study, topographic
           maps of scale 1:25,000 were digitized together with the surveying of key features
           using GPS levelling to produce the data required for the DEM. Key features included
           the international road and the road along the Salam canal. The impact of SLR was
           assessed by producing maps for the inundated areas from a 0.5 m, 1.0 m, 1.5 m, 2.0
           m and 2.5 m SLR. The study showed that initially the water will mainly enter the low
           areas from the coastal lakes (Manzala and Burrullus). The embankment surrounding
           the Salam canal would protect the areas behind it till a level of about 1 m. This

                                              43
    embankment is mostly at a level of 2 m and thus it could be possible to increase the
    level for the lower parts of this embankment to act as a dike. The Burrullus Lake
    however, does not include any embankment surrounding it and thus such an
    embankment could be considered.

o   Impacts of Fish Aquaculture Production on Water Quality in the Northern Nile Delta
    (Cairo University): The overall objective of the study was to develop a model for the
    assessment of impacts of aquaculture production on receiving water bodies for
    different operational scenarios. A mathematical material flow analysis model using a
    spread sheet was developed to predict the generated pollutants from fish aquaculture
    production for different scenarios (run-through or recirculating system). The model is
    based on a mass balance approach. Input parameters were the pond volume, inflow,
    initial water quality, filter outflow water quality, water quality of the pond, feeding
    pattern and quantity, and stocking density. The analysis calculated nutrient loads due
    to fish digestion and respiration, fish yield, and output water discharged to the lakes
    for the two scenarios (conventional and proposed).

o   Dam Break Analysis for Proposed Cascade of Dams on the Blue Nile (Addis Ababa
    University): This study analysed impacts of dam breach in the Blue Nile cascade
    using appropriate modelling tools, focusing on three dams: Grand Ethiopian
    Renaissance, Roseires and Sennar dams in the Blue Nile sub-basin. This analysis
    augments knowledge gaps identified through the JMP1-ID project, which aims to
    understand the impacts on the Abay/Blue Nile catchment of reservoir construction for
    hydropower and other development purposes. The study used a one dimensional
    hydraulic model based on Hydrological Engineering Center River Analysis System
    (HEC-RAS) software to simulate dam break inundation. For each dam, the model
    determined breach size and discharge, routing of the breach discharge downstream,
    and determines flood depths at possible hazard sites. The study conducted a literature
    review to determine the most suitable equations for determining breach size and its
    parameters, breach formation and progression, peak breach outflow discharge, water-
    elevation discharge relationship, flood routing and available GIS-based topographic
    maps. This study derived a very preliminary estimate of the area of flooding, depth
    and velocity in flood plain but noted that findings become grossly unreliable as the
    cross section extension in the study was based on 90 m resolution DEM since no
    other survey measurement was possible under the scope of study.

o   Surface-Groundwater Resources Evaluation and Water Balance for Conjunctive Use
    in the Tana-Beles (Addis Ababa University): The main objective of the study was to
    estimate the groundwater hydrology of the sub-basins and to assess potential
    conjunctive use of surface and groundwater. The results of the exercise produced
    three-dimensional values of hydraulic conductivity for seven distinct zones within the
    region, based on their geological properties and flow regimes, as well as
    classification of these zones in terms of their aquifer productivity. The study also
    determined recharge patterns of the aquifer, from rainfall, percolation to the water
    table from rivers, lakes, ponds, and through localized recharge. The study found that
    two major aquifer systems exist in the catchment. A regional flow system occurs in
    the larger fractured rock aquifer of the tertiary and quaternary volcanics. The second
    aquifer system occurs in the unconsolidated sediments that have in-filled the valleys
    by alluvial processes. Groundwater levels in the unconsolidated aquifers show
    seasonal variation and response to river levels with high levels in the wet winter and
    low levels in the summer. The fractured aquifer is hydraulically connected to the

                                       44
            surface water bodies via a continuous saturated zone. Primarily, the major rivers in
            Tana-Beles sub-basin gain water from the aquifer, however, this relationship can vary
            temporally and spatially and will depend on the relative river and groundwater levels.
            As the aquifers are connected to the river network, the authors recommend that these
            aquifers be better managed.

        o   Investigation of the Upstream Interventions on the Groundwater - Surface Water
            Interaction in the Blue Nile Region in Sudan (Khartoum University). The study
            investigated the impacts of the upstream interventions on the interaction between the
            Blue Nile aquifer and the Blue Nile River and its tributaries. The study found that the
            Blue Nile constitutes the primary recharge source for the Blue Nile Basin aquifer,
            and that current abstraction rates from the aquifer are almost recovered by this total
            annual recharge. While the study found that upstream development plans (e.g., Grand
            Ethiopian Renaissance Dam) do not appear to have any significant impact on
            groundwater recharge, on the other hand, increasing abstractions by 50% will not be
            recovered by recharge from the river resulting in a reduction in groundwater storage.

        o   Multi-Criteria Assessment of Productivity, Water Use and Farm Income as
            Influenced by Institutional Changes in the Gezira Scheme (Khartoum University):
            The main objective of the study was to describe the existing situation of institutional
            reform and investigate its contribution in improving water productivity, income
            generation and poverty reduction in the Gezira Scheme. Specific objectives were
            envisaged to determine the cropping patterns and productivity of crops in Gezira
            Scheme after the formation of the WUAs, to specify the necessary steps required to
            ensure that WUAs have a role to play in poverty reduction, and to develop a Multi-
            Criteria Analysis (MCA) tool with relevant criteria and indicators to describe the
            performance of Gezira Scheme under the WUAs. The study showed that the
            livelihood of the Managil group has improved as member were able to best
            understand the advantages of the institutional changes and explored new cash crops
            of their own choice. The Managil group is also situated such that it receives its
            irrigation water supply from the first control structure on the main canal. The
            Southern group was ranked fourth as it was unable to use the opportunity rendered by
            the freedom of choice of crops, and was not involved in the WUAs formation and
            unaware of their functions. The study recommends that in the future, institutional
            changes be discussed thoroughly with all farmers so that they understand the impacts
            of changes on their livelihoods.

IT Strategy and Policy. This strategy, developed with ENPM support, lays out a vision for a
sustainable information technology framework. Many of these achievements need to be sustained
by ensuring that ENTRO has adequate financing and staffing to adapting to the rapidly changing
IT world. This includes updating software versions, hardware, web portal, possible use of cloud
storage and processing, and building mobile apps to take advantage of the new wave of
smartphone and tablet popularity. This also includes investing in videoconferencing (currently
limited by Government of Ethiopia restrictions) to improve interactions within NBI, with partners,
and as an enabling mechanism for effective distance learning.

Component B: Modeling System Development (Actual cost US$1.92 million or 41% of total
Project cost)

The Project has supported the development of a range of modeling systems to examine issues of
interest for the Eastern Nile. This included a focus on different types of models that could
characterize different parts of the Eastern Nile system to provide the required insights, and
included models that could examine:

        o   Hydrological schematics for each of the major Eastern Nile sub-basins with
            associated information.
        o   Water Balance SWAT model for the Eastern Nile basin was developed to examine
            changes in water cycle interactions (e.g. evapo-transpiration, infiltration, runoff,
            “green? and “blue? water, etc.) with changes in afforestation, rainfed and irrigated
            cropping pattern changes, urbanization, other land use changes, hydrology, existing
            and new reservoir operating rules, etc.
        o   Water Systems Planning (simulating a river basin/sub-basin - e.g. turning on/off
            various reservoir options, changing operating rules/filling strategies, varying
            demands such as agricultural/irrigation including recession agriculture, hydropower,
            industrial, environmental flows, etc.)
        o   Optimization Model for Eastern Nile using public domain/low cost tools (e.g. Excel,
            General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) as used in ENMOS): This included
            the formulation of optimization problems (with appropriate objectives, constraints
            and decision variables) – e.g. to maximize net benefits of water resources
            development       and    management      under     resource,   technology,    policy,
            environmental/social/budget constraints; optimizing coordinated reservoir operating
            rules, with functional specifications.
        o   Enhancements of Flood Forecasting Systems at Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan. Flood
            mapping (based on work done under the Eastern Nile Flood Preparedness and Early
            Warning System Projects I&II) to estimate inundated areas and approximate damage
            costs (including implication for recession agriculture and groundwater) for different
            precipitation/flow regimes.
        o   Climate Change Analysis to analyze historical climate variability in Nile Basin and
            analyzing climate change scenarios in Nile Basin (with specific focus on Eastern Nile
            Basin and to assess the vulnerability of Eastern Nile water system to climate risks;
            identify and evaluate climate change mitigation and adaptation opportunities in the
            Eastern Nile system.

Operationalization of Flood Early Warning Systems (in Ethiopia and Sudan). The tools
developed under ENTRO’s flood management activities have built upon work undertaken by a
previous ENTRO project (Flood Preparedness and Early Warning that closed in December 2010).
In Sudan, ENTRO strengthened existing Flood and Early Warning System (FEWS) and in
Ethiopia supported its establishment and operationalization. These tools allow for the production
of spatial maps, daily rainfall forecasts, and daily flood hazard maps for flood prone areas in the
Eastern Nile. The tools are used to develop flood preparedness emergency action plans and for
the purpose of evacuation and early warning program. In addition to daily forecasts that are
primarily shared with National Forecast Centers, weekly flood bulletins are produced and shared
with a wider range of stakeholders including Ministries, Relief Agencies, Non-Government

to cover flood-prone areas in Gambella, Ethiopia was carried out. To generate these maps: (a)
data was collected and validated based on field surveys to produce terrain models; (b) DEM for
the Gambella floodplains was developed; (c) Stochastic and Hydrologic frequency analysis was
carried out to determine flood quintile under different return periods; (d) HEC-RAS hydraulic
model was configured to determine flood depths and velocities; and (e) Flood hazards maps were
produced using ARC-GIS and Hec-GeoRAS Interface in Arc GIS.

Modeling Tools. Several models were developed under the Project:

       o   Soil and Water Analysis Tool (SWAT): This popular public-domain tool was used to
           develop a calibrated model using public domain datasets for the entire Nile Basin
           with a focus on Eastern Nile scenarios. This model was developed with inputs from
           international experts (e.g. from the CEGIS, Bangladesh, and the primary ArcSWAT
           developer from Texas A&M) as well as regional and national experts (including
           universities). This model has also been used to analyze several development and
           climate change scenarios.
       o   RIBASIM: ENTRO worked with Deltares (developers of RIBASIM) to use this tool
           to develop a calibrated water systems model for the Eastern Nile. This water systems
           model was used to analyze scenarios of changing water demands (e.g. municipal,
           industrial, and agricultural based on country master plans) and scenarios of water
           infrastructure (e.g. new dams) and climate in an integrated manner.
       o   RiverWare: ENTRO worked with an international consultant with extensive
           experience in using RiverWare, developed by the Center for Advanced Decision
           Support for Water and Environmental Systems (CADSWES) and used as the primary
           model for managing the Colorado Basin. This system simulation model was used to
           analyze a number of scenarios, particularly related to Blue Nile mainstem projects
           with different filling and operating rules and their impact downstream (e.g. on Aswan
           levels and hydropower generation).
       o   HEC Suite: ENTRO used the set of free modeling tools developed by the Hydrologic
           Engineering Center of the US Army Corps of Engineers. This included the
           development of Eastern Nile system simulation models using HEC-ResSiM to
           explore the impacts of building water infrastructure on the system hydrology. In
           addition, Hydrological Engineering Center Hydrological Modeling System (HEC-
           HMS) and HEC-RAS were also used for the work related to flood forecasting in the
           Eastern Nile.
       o   Nile DSS Platform and Mike Basin: ENTRO also worked closely with the NBI
           Secretariat to improve synergy between the ENPM Project and Nile DSS activities.
           This included the use of the Nile DSS framework and the use of the Mike Basin
           modeling system that was initially linked to the Nile DSS. This included support for
           the use of the Mike Basin modeling platform as part of the JMP1-ID project activities
           of ENTRO.
       o   Eastern Nile Multi-Purpose Optimization System (ENMOS):                 ENTRO also
           developed an optimization system that allows for selecting the optimal values for key
           decision variables (e.g. reservoir releases, cropping patterns, etc.) in order to
           maximize or minimize selected objectives (e.g. maximizing net benefits in the basin)
           subject to constraints (e.g. related to water, irrigated areas, budgets, physical
           infrastructure limitations, etc.). This model, developed by ENTRO professionals,
           with the support of World Bank and University College of London specialists, uses
           GAMS optimization software linked to an Excel Interface for inputs and outputs.

Project cost)

National Networks (Government and academia). The national networks have primarily been
facilitated by academia. The Project has had good success in building university partnerships
across the Eastern Nile universities. This has expanded from the initial set of 3 selected
universities to include: in Egypt, Cairo University, Ain Shams University, Assuit University,
Alexandria University, and South Valley University; in Ethiopia, Addis Ababa University,
Arbaminch University, Bahir Dar University; Ministry of Water and Energy- Flood Forecast
Center; in Sudan, Khartoum University, Gezira University, Sudan University for Science and
Technology, Ministry of Electricity and Water Resources-Hydraulic Research Station; and in
South Sudan, South Sudan University. These universities have met regularly with Project
facilitation and some have also been engaged to conduct special studies building on their
comparative advantage in different technical areas of specialization.

Internship Program. ENTRO’s internship program was established in December 2011, and
involved several advanced graduate students and young faculty from the partner universities and
governments. Participants included specialists not only in water resources, but also those
working on economic, environmental and other aspects in three continuous batches since the
program’s institution: Batch-1, 9 interns (3 each from Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan); Batch-2, 12
interns (4 each from Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan); and Batch-3, 22 interns (from Egypt, Ethiopia,
Sudan, and South Sudan). These interns had been resident at ENTRO office in Addis Ababa for
about 3-4 months each. Some of the interns in previous batches had also been engaged to guide
interns in subsequent batches. The interns had regular meetings and presentations and also
participated in relevant technical trainings.

Trainings and study tours. Many professionals were trained through formal training events and
study tours. These included:

       o   Decision-makers: The Project was able to reach out 10 decision makers in the
           region: ENCOM (3 ministers), ENSAPT (3 senior professional decision makers), and
           the Heads of the Civil Engineering Departments of Cairo University, Addis Ababa
           University, Khartoum University, and Gezira University (4 highly recognized
           professors).
       o   Senior Professionals: The Project managed to secure the involvement of about 8
           senior water-related professionals in the three countries.
       o   Young professionals: The Project focused on developing a large cadre of younger
           professionals (many possibly future senior professionals and decision makers) to
           create and effectively use the knowledge base, modeling tools, and knowledge
           products on a variety of issues of regional concern. A total of 46 interns participated
           in several informal training processes facilitated by the Project.
       o   Specialized training: Trainings were conducted on the following software: SWAT (1),
           RiverWare (2), RIBASIM (2), GIS (1), Remote Sensing (1) and Interactive Spatial
           Knowledge Products (1).
       o   Study tours: Study tours were organized back-to-back with each of the regional
           workshops and included visits to watershed management efforts in Bahir Dar, water
           supply installations in Mekele, high-productivity agriculture in the West Delta in
           Egypt, and other areas of regional interest.


                                              48

Feedback Obtained During Project Implementation

During the course of Project implementation, ENTRO obtained feedback from stakeholders on
Project’s activities and outputs. Below is a compilation of the feedback received group in three
areas: knowledge base, analytical tools and stakeholder partnerships.

Knowledge Base

•   Good innovative products to base shared trust
•   Very important for planning and management
•   Extensive database, requires quality check
•   Developed knowledge is at satisfactory level, needs more integration
•   To some extent, collected data fill the issue of data scarcity
•   Sharing data is still not clear, more refinement is also needed
•   Young scientists have acquired knowledge essential for the challenge of data scarcity they
    used to face

Feedback Obtained After Project Closure

During the NCORE workshop launch, which took place in March 2013, ENTRO conducted a
survey among workshop participants to obtain their feedback on several aspects of the Project and
the JMP1-ID project. A total of 40 participants responded to the survey representing Egypt (4),
Ethiopia (14), South Sudan (3), Sudan (13) and others (6). The survey did not pretend to be
representative of the diverse institutions that participated in or benefited from either project or
both projects, or the stakeholders in the Eastern Nile basin. It is considered however a good
mechanism to gather input from stakeholders on important aspects of the Project implementation.

When asked to indicate how close the objective of the Project has been met, 85% responded with
an average or better answer.

Annex 6. Summary of Grantee's ICR and Comments on Draft ICR

 The Project has basically met its deliverables. All activities have been implemented to produce
 the outputs as planned, and sometimes even much beyond plans, even though implementation
 modalities were adapted as required. Not only ENTRO, but also the three Eastern Nile
 universities, through their relevant professionals, have built significant experience in and
 exposure to the knowledge base and analytical tools required to prepare, design, reach
 consensus on, implement, and monitor complex, multisectoral, transboundary water resources
 development projects. This helped build capacity in a context in which none of the three
 Eastern Nile universities have previously ever embarked upon in a coordinated manner.
 Lessons of experience in the institutional, technical, and planning domain have been acquired,
 which goes a long way into building a strong regional network of modelers and planners. The
 internship program and developed analytical tools are indications of the right steps in this
 direction. Project implementation has been supported by and done in collaboration with the
 relevant professors, researchers, academia and other relevant stakeholders in the three
 countries. The World Bank has provided invaluable support from the very inception to
 implementation. As indicated in the next section, ENTRO also strongly believes that the
 Project results are sustainable, especially with enhanced support of the Eastern Nile countries
 and development partners.

Context
The ENPM Project was identified as one of ENTRO’s “fast track? in 2005 to act as a precursor
for basin-wide activities and provide ENTRO with in-house analytical and knowledge foundation
to support other activities such as irrigation and drainage, power trade and flood management. It
was intended to strengthen the knowledge, modeling, and stakeholder interaction capacity of
regional and national institutions to plan for water resources investments in a regional context,
with appropriate regard to economic, environmental and social aspects. The Project was to be an
essential building block to stimulate cooperative investments in the region. Not only was the
Project the result of cooperation, but it was thought to be able to further cement this cooperation
through regional projects and the consideration of national projects in a regional context. This
was essential to ensure that scarce financial resources are used effectively and that the region can
take advantage of transformational opportunities that Nile cooperation provides.
A key development during Project conceptualization was that a Cooperative Framework
Agreement (CFA) was being negotiated across countries. A Nile Basin Decision Support System
(DSS) was being conceived as an integrating modeling framework for countries to use across the
basin and the Project was actually initially intended to precede and inform the Nile DSS work in
the Eastern Nile. The preparation of the Project was stalled for almost two years as the Eastern
Nile countries could not reach agreement on the location of the regional coordination of the
Project. The increasing tensions and frustrations relating to lack of agreement on the CFA also
added to the delays in Project preparation and implementation, but underlined the need for a
comprehensive knowledge base, modeling tools, and technical networks to develop a common
understanding of the issues and options for regional cooperation.

Development Objective

The development objective of the Project was that countries in the Eastern Nile operationalize an
improved decision support modeling framework to identify water-related investments and
evaluate them in a regional context. This development objective was met.

                                                56
At the start of the Project, there was little in the way of a comprehensive knowledge base for the
Eastern Nile basin, and extremely limited information in the public domain. There was no
available modeling toolsets in the public domain calibrated for the basin to allow for exploration
of the range of development and management issues that the basin faced. There were no effective
partnerships among or across universities in each Eastern Nile country to work together on water-
related issues of regional interest. At a regional-level, although ENTRO had overseen many
major consultancies related to land and water management, its in-house capacity to organize, use,
and analyze the information was very weak. The use of modern IT tools was limited and ENTRO
website provided little useful information. Countries did not really look to ENTRO to provide the
knowledge and modeling services they needed, especially to support decisions on water-related
investments keeping in mind the regional context. As a result of Project implementation, there has
been a dramatic change in ENTRO’s capacity to develop and use knowledge and analytical
products to support improved planning and management of water resources in the Eastern Nile.
The extensive knowledge base developed has also improved the effectiveness and sustainability
of previous investments to improve the knowledge base and planning. Modeling and visualization
tools developed have been useful to analyze a wide range of development, management, and
climate scenarios in a multi-sectoral context. The Project has facilitated strong partnerships with
academic institutions in the Eastern Nile, which have helped improve research efficiency and
targeting. The equipment, books, datasets, modeling tools, internship program, and capacity-
building efforts would help both government agencies and universities to develop a new cadre of
professionals that are more cognizant of regional water resources perspectives and can utilize the
best available datasets and tools on a more level footing. ENTRO has a new web portal (expected
to be scaled-up to the entire Nile Basin in the next year) with innovative features to improve
public access to information, tools, and knowledge products. All this has placed the region in a
much better position to work cooperatively on water resources development and management and
better understand the regional implications of proposed water-related investments so that more
informed decisions can be made.

Performance Indicators
Performance indicators agreed at negotiations were also all met.

Development of a shared interactive Eastern Nile Knowledge Base and dissemination of a State
of the Eastern Nile Report were satisfactorily accomplished. The Project helped develop a wide
range of knowledge base and products on the Eastern Nile. A wide range of multi-sectoral spatial
layers were collated, computerized, quality checked, and organized into GIS layers collated into
systematic geodatabases were developed for watershed management, power systems, and
irrigation and drainage. Interactive toolkits were developed to provide easy access to thematic and
sub-basin information. A modern interactive web portal was developed to provide enhanced
access to the Eastern Nile knowledge base and knowledge products. An Eastern Nile Atlas was
developed to visualize the spatial diversity of the region. A State of the Eastern Nile Report was
developed to describe the history, context, and future opportunities and risks in the Eastern Nile.

Development of modeling tools to systematically evaluate Eastern Nile investments in a
regional context, examining economic, environmental, and social aspects as allowed by
available data was satisfactorily accomplished. A suite of modeling tools was developed to
provide analytical insights into the resource management and investment options in the Eastern
Nile. This included simulation, optimization, and multi-criteria tools to examine proposed water
investments in a multi-sectoral regional context. A range of reputed modeling tools were used to
support analysis on the Eastern Nile – including SWAT, the HEC suite, RIBASIM, RiverWare,

                                                57
Mike Basin, and the Nile DSS framework. Efforts were made to integrate economic,
environmental, and social aspects in spite of the significant limitations of the available data. The
impacts of investments on sensitive downstream areas were examined for varied scenarios of
sizing, phasing, filling and operational strategies. Optimization tools were developed to examine
options to maximize the net benefits of basin development and management. Flood forecasting
tools were improved to help countries provide early warning to vulnerable residents of flood-
prone areas. Climate change analysis was conducted using a range of the best available GCM
outputs.

Strong institutions at Regional and National levels (in Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan) with
adequate capacity and partners (e.g. University Outreach Centers) to be a focal point for
knowledge and analysis on water investments on the Eastern Nile was accomplished with
mixed results. At regional-level, the Project has helped transform ENTRO into a credible center
to provide regional knowledge and analytical services. ENTRO now has the enabling skills,
knowledge base, modeling tools, networks, partnerships, and outreach mechanisms to be able to
engage a wide variety of stakeholders to help them make more informed decisions on issues and
options that have regional significance. The Project work has also benefitted other NBI activities
(e.g. Nile DSS) and has helped shape the next generation of projects (e.g. NCORE) for the NBI.
At national-level, the Project has had mixed success. It has helped developed excellent
partnerships with universities in the Eastern Nile countries, helping universities to establish better
professional networks both within and across countries, and to partner with a number of ENTRO
activities. The internship program established has been pioneering, helping a new generation of
potential water professionals and leaders to acquire new skills, develop new regional
collaborations, and contribute multi-sectoral perspectives to enhance ENTRO’s knowledge and
analytical services. The Project has also helped improve national government capacity through
provision of equipment and training; however, this has been severely constrained by the current
status of regional cooperation on the EN.
Collaboration with the Nile DSS was satisfactorily accomplished. A key concern during Project
preparation was to maximize the synergy with other Nile Basin analytical activities (particularly
the Nile DDSS under the Water Resources Planning and Management project implemented by the
Nile Secretariat). This was very limited initially – each project was concentrated in implementing
its activities on a very tight timeframe. However, as the Project activities started to pick up,
especially during the third year of implementation, there was a much more robust and meaningful
collaboration. This included co-financing key consultancies related to software development for
additional Nile DSS features, adapters for additional models to be added to the Nile DSS
framework, IT equipment and software to Eastern Nile countries, and co-organizing training
workshops. This has also helped the NBI Secretariat and ENTRO to better agree on future
knowledge, analysis, and partnership needs under the new NCORE project.



Activities and Outputs by Components
Component 1 - Knowledge Base Development: A knowledge base was expected to be developed
to provide a shared, synoptic view of the Eastern Nile basins, including its opportunities and risks
as viewed from an economic, environmental and social perspective. Baseline data were to be
organized systematically in a GIS platform with an associated web portal, and modern datasets
from satellite remote sensing and other global/regional datasets were to be effectively used. The
following is a list of the main activities conducted during the course of Project implementation
and their respective outputs:

                                                 58
    o   Design and develop centralized database: A broad range of data sets was collated from
        several sources to develop a comprehensive knowledge base for the Eastern Nile.
        Organized spatial/GIS datasets in the form of geodatabases were developed at ENTRO
        for watershed, joint multipurpose project investments, power, irrigation and drainage, and
        flood management.
    o   Design and develop data management interface: A number of innovative spreadsheet
        tools were developed at ENTRO to provide easy access to critical thematic and issue-
        specific datasets (e.g. related to erosion/sedimentation, water resources, water
        infrastructure, irrigation, etc.). GIS systems were developed to use the geodatabases
        developed for the spatial knowledge base; and modern interfaces (e.g. web-based, offline
        interactive) were developed to visualize the data in the knowledge base.
    o   Develop data analysis tools: A number of knowledge products (e.g. overlays, animations,
        detailed spatial analysis) were developed to provide support to ENTRO activities. A
        number of interactive tools were also developed to provide thematic support.
    o   Establish quality control procedures: In establishing well-structured centralized
        geodatabases, there was significant effort in ensuring that the data from different sources
        were reconciled, harmonized, and formatted in a common framework
    o   Knowledge products, training and outreach: A number of knowledge products were
        developed, including the Updated Eastern Nile One System Inventory, the Eastern Nile
        Atlas, the State of the Eastern Nile Basin Report, the Eastern Nile under a Changing
        Climate Report, input datasets for a range of models, and a number of datasets and
        interactive tools.

Component 2 - Modeling System: The ENPM modeling system was expected to be developed to
include a suite of simulation, optimization and multi-criteria analytical tools. The models were to
be built on a water systems “spine? using tools developed by the Nile Basin DSS to help analyze
the economic, environmental and social aspects of proposed investments in a water resources
systems framework, and to evaluate alternative scenarios of the future. The tools to be developed
were to be draw upon and contribute to the Knowledge Base to be developed under Component 1,
and were to be flexible to adapt to changing needs and increasing information availability. The
following is a list of the main activities conducted during the course of ENPM Project
implementation and their respective outputs:
    o   Identify modeling/decision support system framework: ENTRO explored the evolving
        needs in terms of modeling systems and pursued those that were useful for its ongoing
        activities (e.g. related to watershed management, climate risk management, irrigation
        systems, power systems, and water infrastructure development). A review of a range of
        available models (including the Nile Basin DSS) was undertaken and then ENTRO
        pursued those most suited tools to support decision making.
    o   Fine-tune an apply basin simulation system: Several simulation models were developed
        including the Nile Basin DSS, SWAT, RiverWare, RIBASIM, and HEC tools (including
        HEC-ResSiM, HEC-RAS, HEC-HMS).
    o   Develop and implement basin optimization system: Two basin optimization models were
        developed: ENMOS and RiverWare.
    o   Develop multi-criteria analytical tools: Basic multi-criteria analysis tools were used under
        the special studies.
    o   Define and develop standard system output: Scenario visualization tools, web-facilitated
        tools and individual modeling tools to explore scenarios were developed. Similarly,
        adapters to Nile DSS framework were developed to facilitate visualization of outputs.


                                                59
Component 3 - Institutional and Human Capacity Building: The ENPM was expected to
support a structured stakeholder process to ensure that the systems developed would be driven by
multi-sectoral stakeholder demand and appropriate to support decision-making. It was expected
that the Project activities and training would strengthen ENTRO as a strong knowledge-driven
regional institution, as well as improve the capacity of national institutions, reducing the current
disparity in national capacity for such activities. Networking with academia and other
international river basins was also expected to be pursued to improve cross-fertilization of ideas
and sustainability. The following is a list of the main activities conducted during the course of
Project implementation and their respective outputs:

    o   Facilitate structured stakeholder interaction: At regional level, the Project organized,
        facilitated, or provided inputs to a variety of forums – NBI Forums, Regional Working
        Groups, as well as a set of technical ENPM Project workshops in Eastern Nile countries.
        At the country level, the Project facilitated access to data, tools, and networking among
        professionals in countries; however, the work directly with ministries and policy makers
        was more limited during implementation due to the prevailing Eastern Nile country
        relationship issues. University networking was enhanced under the Project for all Eastern
        Nile universities. An innovative set of internships was established with all key
        universities in the Eastern Nile in order to both contribute to Project’s product
        development and to more effective dissemination by investing in young faculty and
        graduate students from Eastern Nile universities.
    o   Establish and develop ENPM institutional setting/ structures: The Project activities were
        mainstreamed within ENTRO and did not remain just as a separate project to be
        implemented by ENTRO. The revised focus on in-house capacity helped convert ENTRO
        staff to become more hands-on with the knowledge base and models being developed and
        make ENTRO a center of excellence on the knowledge and analytical aspects of the
        Eastern Nile. The Project helped develop a community of modelers working on the
        Eastern Nile and provide them support in the form of data, tools, and networking.
    o   Strengthen institutional and human capacity: The Project helped facilitate significant
        training and capacity building. Within ENTRO, the Project supported IT equipment,
        internet, data, tools, professional development. At the level of regional institutions, the
        Project helped provide inputs to shape future NBI activities; support to NB DSS activities.
        Eastern Nile government institutions were provided with vehicles, some enabling IT and
        furniture. Eastern Nile universities were supported for IT hardware/software and related
        furniture, and books.
    o   Strengthen data availability, accessibility, and quality: The Project was able to develop a
        first set of organized datasets, tools, and reports in the public domain, improved data

Key Challenges Faced and Changes Made During Implementation

There were a number of challenges that were faced by ENTRO – many of these were resolved
without major Project restructuring as the design of the Project allowed for flexibility in
implementation modalities to achieve the development objective and key outputs. The key
challenges that were encountered and the resulting changes made as a part of adaptive
management by ENTRO in consultation with the Bank during implementation were the
following:
Inadequate availability of critical data/information. The knowledge base and analytical capacity
to be developed under ENPM were underpinned by the availability of critical datasets and
information on proposed investments. Access to these often remained a challenge during
implementation. During preparation, activities such as collation of masterplans, the CRAs, the
One System Inventory, and others really helped bring much of the relevant available information
into ENTRO. In addition, during implementation, modern high-resolution global data sources,
including those based on earth observation, were extensively tapped. University partnerships and
internships were used to fill critical knowledge gaps.
Lack of ENTRO governance consent to primary Project’s consultancy. A large consultancy
contract to provide implementation support for the Project was under competitive procurement
process for many months; however, ENTRO could never get its governance to clear this large
consultancy as required as its governance had not met for almost two years during a particularly
tense phase related to the CFA. When it was clear that the selected Consultant would not have
sufficient time to deliver the proposed outputs even if recruited, and given little prospect for an
ENCOM meeting, ENTRO worked with the Bank to modify implementation arrangements. Even
though the development objective, components, and result indicators remained the same,
implementation modalities were drastically changed to allow ENTRO to use in-house expertise
supported by small consultancies to deliver the products. More systematic university partnerships
were also developed and an extensive internship program was initiated. In many ways, this “Plan
B? was considered to be more effective than “Plan A? in terms of building in-house capacity and
bringing a diversity of expertise and outreach opportunities to ENTRO and academia.
Inadequate mainstreaming of Project within ENTRO During preparation, ENTRO had
considered Project to be one of its many projects to be implemented almost like separate project
implementation units within ENTRO. Early in implementation, ENTRO reorganized itself the
need to institutionalize all its “projects? into its evolving structure. The ENPM was one of the
primary activities under the newly established Water Planning Unit. During implementation, as
the Project helped produce credible knowledge bases, analytical tools, and drew on academic
professionals, ENTRO increasingly worked to ensure that all Project’s activities were also
relevant to its other major units and programs.
Inadequate synergy with Nile DSS. The Nile DSS work being undertaken by the Nile Secretariat
needed to be synergized with the Project activities being undertaken by ENTRO. During
preparation, and also during early implementation, areas of synergy were identified among the
Nile DSS and the Project activities, but there were problems to operationalize them as the Nile
DSS work packages got underway, and the Project primary consultancy was stalled. After the
“Plan B? was agreed, the synergy improved significantly, and towards the end of the two projects,
the Project was co-financing and co-organizing joint activities with the Nile DSS.
Tight implementation timeframe. The Project was to close on October 30, 2012 providing a tight
timeframe given the late start for “Plan B?.As per ENTRO’s request, the Bank provided no-
objection to extending the Project by two more months till the end of CY2012 to allow for a more
orderly closure of Project activities and improved synergy with the Nile DSS.

Benefits of the Project
     The work done under ENPM is critical especially for the NBI institutions at the regional-
     level and also critical for each of the Eastern Nile countries as summarized below.

     Regional-Level:
     ENTRO:
     The ENPM project has been instrumental in providing ENTRO with the enabling knowledge
     base, modelling tools, and professional networks and institutional capacity in order to better
     serve its member countries in their efforts to better develop, manage, and utilize the shared
     waters of the Nile Basin. This includes a comprehensive and well-organized knowledge
     base, including spatial information organized into thematic geodatabases. This has also
     enabled ENTRO to more effectively utilize past studies that it has conducted (e.g. the
     Cooperative Regional Assessments) as well as other available global, regional, and national
     information. The quality management and organization of the knowledge base has also
     made it possible to visualize this information in many different forms for publications and
     presentations (e.g. charts, maps, animations), develop input datasets as required for a wide
     variety of modelling tools, and develop a range of thematic and sub-basin toolkits. A range
     of models has also been developed using the available knowledge base to test a variety of
     development and climate scenarios. ENTRO has also built strong relationships with
     regional academic institutions and young modelling professionals through the internship
     programs. This has enabled ENTRO to develop credibility as a knowledge institution that
     has good access to knowledge, tools, and expertise on critical issues facing the Eastern Nile
     and be in a position of being a centre of excellence to provide knowledge and analytical
     helpdesk services to the region. The ENPM project has also helped ENTRO to fulfil its
     mandate on its other activities as shown in the table below:

                          Support for use of knowledge base and modelling tools developed, and ENTRO
                          professionals trained under the ENPM project. In particular, to explore the
Joint Multipurpose        implications of new dams and cascade options on the Blue Nile on flooding,

                          in Sudan and at Aswan in Egypt), and on the recession agriculture along the
                          Blue and Main Nile.
                          The ENPM project has supported the refinement and updating of models used in
Flood Preparedness        the FPEW project, improved the development of linked hydrologic models (e.g.
and Early Warning         near Lake Tana and in Sudan) to improve hydrologic forecasts, improved the
Project                   use of satellite earth observation data products, and supported the continued
                          flood forecasting products issued during flood season by ENTRO.
                          Comprehensive datasets have been developed relating to topography, land use,
                          population distribution, agriculture, soils, climate, etc. to improve understanding
                          of watersheds in the basin. Erosion modelling has been done with the support of
EN Watershed Project
                          models such as SWAT. A detailed watershed management toolkit has been
                          developed to provide easy access to a comprehensive set of data and
                          visualizations on erosion, sedimentation, and watershed management practices.
                          The ENPM work has also proved useful overall for corporate reporting,
                          ENCOM/ENSAPT, NileCOM/NileTAC meetings, building partnerships with
Overall
                          universities and global knowledge institutions and professionals, and to support
                          interactions with development partners.

                                                   62
Other NBI:
The ENPM project has also provided benefits to other NBI institutions. This includes
support to activities of the NBI Secretariat under the Water Resources Planning and
Management Project – primarily the Nile DSS (e.g. through sharing datasets, co-financing of
software development, hardware provision to National Ministries of Water in Egypt,
Ethiopia, and Sudan, and training programs/workshops). The ENPM work has also
influenced the design of the NCORE project aimed at strengthening all NBI institutions
starting 2013.

Country-Level:
The ENPM project has provided a number of country-level benefits to Egypt, Ethiopia, and
Sudan as indicated below:
• National Government Agencies: The ENPM project has supported the provision of
  equipment (IT hardware, software, and modelling tools – both for ENPM and Nile DSS,
  vehicles) and training to the Water Ministries. This has helped improve the links among
  government water professionals in various Eastern Nile countries and with the NBI, as
  well as allow for transfer of knowledge bases, modelling tools, and analytical techniques
  to enhance modernization of water management in the Eastern Nile countries.
• Universities: The ENPM project has built strong relationships with key technical
  Universities in the Eastern Nile countries. This has helped universities undertake demand-
  driven research (e.g. special studies) to respond to critical problems in the Eastern Nile, as
  well as improve partnerships within the universities (e.g. via the Focal Coordination Units
  in one university in each country). They have also been able to provide some of their best
  students and young faculty to work with ENTRO as interns and benefit from, and
  contribute to, the development of a shared knowledge base and analytical tools. The
  knowledge base and modelling tools should also help support future research at these
  Universities. The ENPM Project has also supported the universities with IT hardware,
  related furniture, software, datasets, and books to support current and future generations of
  students working on issues of analytical relevance to the Eastern Nile.
• General Public: The project has made special efforts to improve the availability of quality
  information in the public domain to demystify and improve understanding of complex,
  and often controversial, issues in the Eastern Nile ranging from construction of large dams
  on the Blue Nile to the additional challenges that climate change may bring to the region.
  The new ENTRO website (to be expanded Basin-wide under the NCORE project)
  provides improved access to public domain data, supports easy visualization of complex
  spatial information (e.g. through the Eastern Nile Atlas and online mapping), provides
  easy to read summaries of the Eastern Nile (e.g. through the State of the Eastern Nile
  Report), and provides access to tools so others can build upon this work. The internship
  program and workshops have also helped improve awareness of the need to consider
  national investments in a regional context, as well as build a community of modellers in
  the Eastern Nile.
• South Sudan: South Sudan was declared an independent country in 2012 and was recently
  admitted as an NBI member country. This new country has weak institutions and
  universities (recovering from decades of civil war) and extremely low capacity in meeting
  its challenge to develop and manage its water resources for the benefit of its largely very
  poor population. With the support of ENPM, ENTRO has begun the process of supporting
  this newest African nation by supporting interns from Juba University. At ENTRO’s
  invitation and facilitation, the water-related ministries in South Sudan have also begun to
  participate in technical workshops to showcase and train participants in ENPM products.


                                           63
Sustainability
Many of these activities were designed and developed keeping in mind sustainability
considerations but there remains much to be done. There are a number of technical, financial, and
institutional issues that need to be considered while exploring the sustainability of the Project
activities.

Technical. The technical challenges include the following:
    o   Knowledge Base: The Project has actually helped improve the sustainability of previous
        NBI and other efforts in building the best available knowledge base related to the
        region’s water resources planning and management. This includes the CRA completed
        for power trade, watershed management, and irrigation and drainage as well as
        information from a number of Master Plans and other studies were carefully collated,
        computerized, and organized into systematic geodatabases. A number of other datasets
        were also collated. This has helped ensure that much of the work conducted previously
        with expensive consultancies and stakeholder inputs were collated into a flexible
        knowledge platform. However, this knowledge platform will need to be continually
        updated to reflect stakeholder feedback, demands placed on ENTRO’s knowledge and
        analytical services, as well as additional reports and datasets as they are created/updated
        (incl. from available global/earth observation, regional, and local datasets and research
        products). The knowledge platform developed at ENTRO can serve as a repository of
        updated knowledge on the Eastern Nile to improve the use and sustainability of future
        activities that add to the knowledge base or draw from it. In order to do this, ENTRO has
        to ensure that it has the necessary technical staff/skills/partnerships to keep the
        knowledge base updated. Also, more work is required to update the knowledge base,
        particularly on environmental, social, and economic aspects where more systematic,
        comprehensive, primary data would need to be generated.
    o   Analytical Tools: When the Project was being conceived, there was much debate about
        whether only one modeling platform should be pursued or flexibility should be
        maintained on the choice of modeling platform. At the end, given the lack of an
        integrated modeling platform that could help answer the varied questions that the region
        was trying to explore, ENTRO decided to use the best tools available or that could be
        built/customized to address the various issues that are critical to the Eastern Nile. This
        included use of the Nile DSS platform as well the development of a number of “as
        required? toolkits and models that were fit-for-purpose in analyzing watershed
        management, irrigated agriculture, power systems, flood forecasting, groundwater, dam
        failures, among other themes. This approach could make use of the comparative
        advantages of different state-of-the-art specialized models available today. The Project
        also co-financed activities with Nile Sec to build adapters in the Nile DSS to expand the
        suite of models that could interface with the Nile DSS platform. All this aids
        sustainability as it avoids over-reliance on one tool or set of tools, and can benefit from
        several innovative and creative approaches to addressing critical development and
        management problems related to the Eastern Nile. This also allows the use of several
        modeling tools that build on the information in a common knowledge platform to help
        cross-check and develop new insights on results. This also allows for expanding the
        elements of university partnerships as different faculty and students in Eastern Nile
        universities are familiar with different modeling tools. ENTRO will need to ensure that it
        has the necessary staffing and skills to stay on top of the new developments in water-
        related models and build additional partnerships to explore the use of a rapidly-evolving
        set of modern tools.


                                               64
    o   Information Technology: The Project has managed to leverage advances in modern
        software and hardware to develop a range of appropriate mechanisms to analyze and
        access data and information to generate knowledge products and services. Software
        applications includes the development of a state-of-the-art Web Portal, a range of
        interactive knowledge products including the use of innovative interactive spreadsheets,
        interactive PDFs, animations, offline and online GIS platforms, remote sensing analyses,
        and presentations. Hardware advances facilitated by the Project include the use of
        modern PCs, upgrading the server network, dramatically improving internet access
        speeds, and piloting the use of modern Tablets (iPADs). The Project also helped support
        the development of ENTRO’s IT strategy and policy that lays out a vision for a
        sustainable information technology framework. Many of these achievements need to be
        sustained by ensuring that ENTRO has adequate financing and staffing to adapting to the
        rapidly changing IT world. This includes updating software versions, hardware, web
        portal, possible use of the cloud for storage and processing, and building mobile apps to
        take advantage of the new wave of smartphone and tablet popularity. This also includes
        investing in videoconferencing (currently limited by Government of Ethiopia restrictions)
        to improve interactions within NBI, with partners, and as an enabling mechanism for
        effective distance learning.

Institutional. The most critical issue related to sustainability of the Project activities relates to
institutional issues. In many regional forums (e.g. the Strategic Dialogue between NBI and its
Development Partners), participants recognize that commitment to cooperation the only way to
ensure sustainability of benefits from the shared Nile Basin water resources and that NBI is the
most appropriate platform to take the agenda forward. However, there remain many unresolved
issues to get a basin-wide cooperative framework and move to a comprehensive Nile Basin
Commission. There is also some concern among Eastern Nile partners states regarding some of
the large unilateral investments proposed. This situation results in some uncertainty on the future
structure, staffing, funding, and mandates of the NBI institutions such as ENTRO. This will also
have significant implications for the sustainability of the Project achievements. It should be noted
that if the current capacity of regional institutions to provide such knowledge and analytical
services is diminished or eliminated, it will probably take many years to rebuild the capacity and
networks required to provide such services again.

The ENPM outputs in terms of the knowledge base, knowledge products, analytical/modeling
tools, and stakeholder networks (e.g. university networks and the Eastern Nile modeling
community) are of use not only to ENTRO to support its various evolving activities, but also the
overall NBI. There are also a number of analytical activities related to the use of several different
modeling suites, innovative flood forecasting tools, and interactive thematic/sub-basin toolkits
that can be adapted to work on the rest of the Nile Basin (especially the Lake Victoria/NEL
region). In this respect, it will be critical for NBI Secretariat, Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary
Action Program, and Lake Victoria Basin Commission to benefit from such work. ENTRO also
needs to explore ways to better engage other relevant regional organizations (e.g. RECs, Regional
Climate Centers, Regional Training Centers) as well as build partnerships with other basin
organizations. In particular, it would be useful to strengthen the networking with NGOs and/or
Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) forums such as the Nile Basin Discourse and research forums
that can benefit from, and contribute to, improving public access and user feedback for the
knowledge and analytical products initiated by the ENPM Project.

The role of Eastern Nile country government professionals has been more limited (due to the
status of regional cooperation) and needs enhancing in the years ahead. The Project (directly and
in partnership with Nile DSS) provided limited support to government agencies in terms of

                                                 65
equipment and operating costs. Some government professionals have also participated in regional
forums and internship programs financed by the Project. There is a need for much more enhanced
interaction of ENTRO with country government professionals to ensure that they can access, use,
and contribute to refinement of the knowledge base and analytical tools developed.

One of the highlights of the ENPM Project has been the excellent partnerships with Eastern Nile
universities that have been useful both to academia and ENTRO. It has helped universities to
organize themselves within each country to help contribute to regional issues. For example,
although the ENPM Project started with working with only one university in each country, this
network rapidly expanded to include all other main universities in the region. Project has helped
foster these relationships by organizing joint meetings to allow university expert faculty to
comment on work being undertaken in Project, and to facilitate meetings of modeling specialists
within each country. Special studies have been financed by the project to build on the
comparative advantages of each university to address critical knowledge gaps in the Eastern Nile.
An innovative internship program has been established in ENTRO (so far 3 batches of about 13
interns each have been resident in ENTRO for about 3-4 months each learning regional
perspectives of various thematic issues and contributing to the development of knowledge
products). This work with academia contributes to the overall sustainability of the Project as now
there are a group of interested professionals that will be able to access, use, and build upon the
Project’s products to undertake targeted research and provide advice to governments as required.
This work with academia will benefit from sustained financing especially to continue the
internship program, special studies, regional workshops, and new innovations such as
modeling/app development competitions and hackathons that could inspire the next generation of
creative thinkers to contribute to resolving what seem like intractable problems today related to
water resources development and management in the Eastern Nile.

ENTRO will need to also continue to expand its general communication – the new web portal
should help in this regard, but additional activities will need to be undertaken related to
development of newsletters, updating of email and hardcopy distribution lists, and ways to solicit
and act upon feedback from users of Project’s products.

Financial. The activities undertaken by ENTRO under the Project would need to be sustained
from a technical and institutional perspective as indicated above. However, all these activities (e.g.
hardware/software/website upgrades, staffing, partnerships, internships, targeted studies,
workshops and training, communications and outreach, etc.) would require continued financing.
This also has to be done in a difficult regional cooperation environment. Given the utility of
sustaining the Project activities to promote better-informed regional cooperation, such financing
would need to come from the NBI/ENTRO member states as well as development partners. The
NILECOM decided in July, 2012 to emphasize member country commitment to maintain
minimum functionality of the NBI. There would be a need for additional country commitment to
finance their government agencies to better interact with ENTRO to use the Project outputs.
Universities have been excellent partners on the Project and it is expected that their work done
and networks developed will actually help them access additional resources to build on the
Project work. Development partners have also expressed willingness to continued support to the
NBI programs and projects in the October, 2012 Nile Basin Strategic Dialogue. For example, the
design of the Nile Cooperation for Results (NCORE) project financed by the Nile Basin Trust
Fund and the Cooperation for International Waters in Africa (CIWA) Trust Funds managed by
the World Bank and implemented by the three NBI institutions (NBI Secretariat, ENTRO, and
Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action Program) has a number of elements that sustain the
achievements of the Project.
