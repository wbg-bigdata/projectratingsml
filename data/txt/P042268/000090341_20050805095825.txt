3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

The Project's main development objectives were to: (a) improve through automation the efficiency and
reliability of Provincial Electricity Authority's distribution network and strengthen its operational
capabilities; (b) upgrade the distribution system in South Thailand to meet demand growth at least cost; (c)
strengthen PEA's engineering and management capabilities through the integration of its Geographical
Information System (GIS) with the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system; (d) help
rationalize PEA's interfacing arrangements with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT);
and (e) help investigate issues and options for the regulatory framework for the energy sector. Supporting
PEA in restructuring and corporatization was a rationale for Bank involvement.

At appraisal in 1996, Thailand experienced a rapid growth in electricity demand, fuelled by widespread
industrial and commercial development in provinces around Bangkok. This development placed increasing
demands on service quality and reliability from a utility primarily accustomed to rural electrification.
System reliability and efficiency were eroding. Under this scenario, the Government attached utmost
importance to strengthening operational efficiency and laid down specific targets for reliability and losses.
PEA's response was to embark on an automation project, the like of which had not been introduced even in
more advanced countries. While adequate consulting assistance was provided, the Project stretched PEA's
technical resources to the utmost. Exacerbated by the country's economic crisis (1997-2000), Project
implementation sprawled over seven years. When the Project was conceived, the stage had been set for
commercialization of the three Thai Electricity utilities and it was appropriate to initiate concrete steps for
the restructuring and corporatization of PEA. The Project objectives were thus aptly targeted to the sector's
needs. Further, development of electricity infrastructure was consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) to strengthen Thailand's infrastructure base to regain international competitiveness.
Organizational restructuring and commercialization of PEA was in line with the Bank's and the
Government's sector strategy, but the expectation of its achievement within a rather rigid framework and a
reasonable time frame was ambitious; however, this turned out largely due to factors which could not have
been foreseen at appraisal.

3.2 Revised Objective:

The original objectives remained unchanged.

3.3 Original Components:

The Project had the following main components:

A. Investment Components: - These comprised:

(a) Distribution Automation System, including: (i) a Systems Management Center at PEA's Head Office in
Bangkok; (ii) five, Distribution Dispatching Centers (DDCs) in PEA's Central Region Areas 1, 2, 3,
Southern Region Area 1 and Northern Region Area 3; (iii) 1,600, Remote Control Switches (RCS) in a
total of    1,072 trunk feeder circuits; (iv) 124, Remote Terminal Units in 124 substations; (v)
communication between the substations and the DDCs on microwave and communication between the RCS
and the substations on a UHF radio point to point network; and (vi) consulting services for design,
procurement and supervision.




                                                     - 2 -

(b) Upgrading Distribution in South Thailand, including: (i) 17, 115/33 kV; six, 115/22 kV; and one,
115/115 kV substations, with a total transformer capacity of about 1,650 MVA; (ii) 722 km of 115 kV
transmission lines; and (iii) consulting services for engineering, design and procurement.

B. Technical Assistance Components: - Consulting studies for: (i) Rationalization of Interfacing
Arrangements with EGAT ­ to evolve a rational framework for division of ownership between EGAT and
PEA, an important ingredient towards commercialization; and (ii) Regulatory Framework for the Energy
Sector - to review the regulatory structure and recommend a framework suitable for a restructured
Electricity Supply Industry (ESI).

Both, the Investment and the Technical Assistance components were closely linked to the project objectives.
Recognizing that PEA had no previous experience in: (i) Automation - adequate consulting assistance was
provided; still implementation proved rather onerous for PEA's capabilities; and (ii) Commercialization -
the organizational restructuring steps were phased; yet the rather rigidly conceived annual organizational
changes could not be fully complied with.

The lesson learned to advance land procurement was applied; in practice only one line component
experienced severe right of way procurement delays.

3.4 Revised Components:

The Project components remained unchanged.

3.5 Quality at Entry:

The quality of entry of the Project is rated as satisfactory. Its design and objectives were fully consistent
with Government's sector policies and the CAS. While the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) identified the risk
of delay due to tardy procurement decisions, it could not foresee the extent to which the procurement
process would prolong, resulting in a procurement time of four years instead of two and an overall
installation time of seven years instead of four, for the Automation component. Likewise, the extent of
delays in implementation of the more straightforward distribution expansion component could also not be
visualized. Both these delays were to no small extent caused by the country's 1997-1999
financial/economic crisis which led to a depression of demand and resulted in: (i) a sector-wide resistance
towards implementation; (ii) a drawn out procurement process, exacerbated by Government clamping down
on the utilities' budgets; and (iii) local contractors running out of funds to sustain the pace of installation.
The risk of demand shortfall was recognized but the extent of the impact on demand of the
economic/financial crisis could not be gauged. Risks of delay in land acquisition were predicted, but not
quite the delay which occurred due to environmental considerations affecting ROW of one line component
adjacent to a reserved forest; a testimony to Thailand's evolving environmental consciousness. The Project
complied with the Bank's Safeguard policies and those were fully met.

Organizational restructuring was staged and covenanted but the checkered tale of its implementation
unfolded only over the years (see Section 10 and Annex 10).

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

The Project's overall outcome is rated as satisfactory. Although implementation stretched over seven



                                                       - 3 -

years, it was fully and satisfactorily accomplished. The organizational restructuring and commercialization
objective was and the corporatization objective (registration as a PEA Public Limited Company) would be
satisfactorily achieved, but it fell short of SAR expectation to split PEA into four Regional Distribution
Companies. Additionally, privatization, though not explicitly contemplated in the SAR, is likely to be
attained. The achievement of the objective ­ to improve the efficiency and reliability of the distribution
system, contain losses, improve manpower utilization and strengthen PEA's operations and management
capabilities - was admirably met. Due to PEA's skillful down-scaling of investments as demand faltered, its
overall financial position remained sound.

Objective 1: Improve through automation the efficiency and reliability of PEA's distribution network
and strengthen its operational capabilities.

The system efficiency improvement objective was fully met, with substantive improvements in losses and
manpower utilization (see Annex 1) and operational and management efficiency. These achievements were
due to significant improvements in operation and maintenance practices and well-timed, well-positioned,
and aptly-curtailed investments in distribution infrastructure, in consonance with power demand.
Manpower utilization was improved due to personnel policies that stopped recruitment of non-technical
staff and encouraged early separation. Reliability targets set by PEA were substantially met and significant
improvements in reliability due to automation are expected when the systems are fully operational.

Objective 2: Upgrade the distribution system in the south of Thailand to meet demand growth efficiently
and at least cost.

Although there was an inordinate delay (part of which was contrived and justifiably so) of about four years
in implementation, this objective was ultimately fully met and substations installed under the Project are
carrying satisfactory levels of load, following recovery from the 1997-1999 economic/financial crisis. The
overall implementation delay could be tolerated, and in some ways was a blessing, as it deferred
expenditures and averted creation of under-utilized assets.

Objective 3: Strengthen PEA's engineering and management capabilities through the integration of its
Geographical Information System (GIS) with the proposed Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA) system

This objective is well on its way towards full achievement. The GIS data capture consists of: (i) high
voltage network ­ mainly graphical information (without electrical devices attribute data); (ii) substations -
at a very high level (not extending to devices); and (iii) distribution feeders - with both graphical and
electrical attribute data. Current GIS graphical and electrical attribute data in the MV network is imported
into the SCADA/DMS system (network data model). These are load flow, demand estimation, fault
analysis, etc. Gepgraphical displays for HV applications will be implemented by end 2005, when the GIS
graphical and electrical attribute data models have been developed, and have started importing data into the
SCADA system.

Objectives 4 and 5: (4) Help rationalize PEA's interfacing arrangements with EGAT, an important step
towards its regionalization and subsequent privatization; and (5) Help investigate the issues and options for
the regulatory framework for the energy sector.

These objectives were fully met. Interfacing arrangements between PEA and EGAT are under
implementation. The Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP) link is used across WANs to



                                                     - 4 -

enable the exchange of real-time and historical power monitoring data including measured values,
scheduling data, energy accounting data and operator messages. This information is useful for planning and
operation of the transmission, sub-transmission and distribution systems. As a next step, there will be a
rearrangement of the interfacing areas. PEA and EGAT are currently negotiating the scope of the
obligations between the two utilities and transfer of appropriate facilities from EGAT to PEA.

The Regulatory Framework Study was efficiently managed by the National Energy Policy Office (NEPO)
and its recommendations provided useful inputs to the framing of the Energy Act, the crafting of the
Regulatory Framework and drafting of secondary legislations.

Objective 6: Assist PEA in its efforts towards restructuring and subsequent corporatization.

The Staff Appraisal Report envisaged the following steps towards restructuring and corporatization of
PEA:      Step 1 ­ Decentralization of management to the four Regional Areas (September, 1996)
commencing with business units as cost centers transiting to profit centers (September, 1997). Step 2 ­
Creation of PEA Holding Company (September, 1999) (providing central services such as tariff
coordination, power system management and debt control; with Regional entities as separate corporations
under PEA. Step 3 ­ Separation of non core functions as separate subsidiaries and their eventual spin off.
This transition was expected to take about four years.

Except that PEA would not be broken up into four Regional Distribution Companies as envisaged in the
SAR the objective of restructuring the organization has been and the objective of corporatization would be
met, with PEA registering itself as the "PEA Public Company Ltd." with the Ministry of Commerce in
2005 and possibly privatizing itself as a whole, by way of public offering of a portion of its equity
(probably about 30%) later.

PEA's corporatization and privatization plans call for clear separation among DisCos, SupplyCos and
Non-core businesses and its organizational restructuring involves creation of five categories: (a) Regional
Network Operations,covering network-related functions; (b) Regional Regulated Retail,covering supply to
customers; (c) Competitive Retail and Market Development,covering supply on a competitive basis; (d)
Ventures, covering non-core business; and (e) Support services, covering support and administrative
functions. The separation of Network Operations from Regulated Retail Operations would only be on an
accounting basis (cost-center mode) and not on the basis of creating separate legal entities (profit-center
mode). Potential legal separation could be ushered in later when the Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) and
the Government are prepared for it.

The less-than-expected achievement of this objective is due to vacillations in Government policy (and
Government changes) on sector reform, reluctance of the electricity utilities to espouse major structural
changes (based on legitimate concerns but also special interests); and objection by the unions of the three
utilities to listing on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. Thus, while the basic policy for reform, restructuring
and privatization was maintained in consonance with the Project's overall objective, its implementation
course was quite checkered (see Section 10 and Annex 10 for details).

Financial Objective and Compliance with Financial Covenants:

Inspite of the 1997 economic/financial crisis, the financial objectives of the Project, as defined by its
covenanted financial ratios (a self-financing ratio (SFR) of not less than 25% of three-year average capital
expenditure; a rate of return (ROR) on revalued assets of not less than 4%; a long-term debt to equity ratio
not exceeding 1.5 times; and outstanding short and medium term debt not to exceed 15% of all debt), were


                                                     - 5 -

admirably achieved (see Annex 1).        While maintaining a robust SFR over the entire tenure of the loan,
PEA could not comply with the ROR covenant in most of the years. The ROR covenant was rightly judged
to be inappropriate for assessing PEA's performance and was dropped in June 2001 because the Bank
agreed with PEA that: (i) the SFR, Debt Service Coverage and Debt Equity ratios are already adequate
indicators of PEA's financial health; (ii) the ROR target is inappropriate for a a utility with a large and
lumpy investment program; (iii) it should have the same set of covenants as EGAT and MEA, who were
not required to comply with ROR targets; (iv) in monitoring financial efficiency and setting tariffs, the
Government does not subject any of the utilities to an ROR test; (v) as a state enterprise with a rural
electrification mandate and in view of the economic recession during the project period, its financial
objective is aimed more at sustaining liquidity rather than seeking a profitable return on operating assets;
(vi) its investment projects during the project period to serve the economic recovery program under the
National 9th Five-Year Plan, were non-profitable projects in the short term because most of them focus on
upgrading the operational and service capacity which results in long-term returns; and (vii) current global
thinking of achieving a reformed and effectively regulated power sector was to move away from cost-plus
tariff setting, such as return on assets, towards performance-based tariff setting that encourages efficiency.


Barring 1999, PEA realized positive net incomes. In response to severe demand drepressions following the
1997 emergency, PEA resorted to: (i) prudent financial management; (ii) drastic reduction in capital
investment; (iii) significant improvements in operating efficiency; and (iv) recouping foreign exchange
losses from consumers through the tariff surcharge mechanism. As a result, capital expenditures and
related long-term debt were brought down way below appraisal projections. The tariff for purchase of
power from EGAT increased well above appraisal forecasts, but this was matched by retail tariff increases,
a sign of prudent sector regulation by the Government.

4.2 Outputs by components:

The Project's physical components were fully executed within the two-year­extended loan closing date of
December 31, 2004, with high standards of quality, environmental, social, aesthetical and safety
considerations. Delays were largely due to: (i) Distribution Automation ­ a per se lengthy procurement
process of prequalification and two stage bidding; stalling mid-stream by Government's directive to reduce
budget outlay; consequent price negotiations with the lowest bidder; Bank's refusal to accept price
negotiations; and re-invitation of bids from all pre-qualified bidders once again on a two stage basis (such a
lengthy procurement process, albeit for a complex system, may be a record in Bank's history); and (ii)
Distribution Upgrading - lengthy procurement decisions (a malady from which PEA internal systems have
not recovered); local contractors facing severe financial crunch during the emergency; and unexpectedly
lengthy ROW clearance for a transmission line component on environmental grounds.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

Distribution Automation. At appraisal, the principal benefit "saving in un-served energy" was evaluated at
B45.7/kWh or US$1.83/kWh (US$1=B25), based on a 1986 consulting study, and the Economic Internal
Rate of Return (EIRR) was 12%. A reliable value of this parameter is currently not available. It can,
however, be safely assumed that this value would today be much higher in view of the change in character
of PEA's load from rural/domestic to industrial/commercial. The ICR evaluates the EIRR for two values of
"un-served energy": (i) the value at which the Project's EIRR reaches the thresh-hold viability level of 10%
- this value is calculated at B53/kWh or US$1.26/kWh (US$1=B42); and (ii) the appraisal value of
US$1.83/kWh translated into B76.9/kWh (US$1=B42) ­ this value is calculated at 14.5%. It may be
concluded that Distribution Automation continues to be economically viable, in spite of a long drawn out

implementation time and a severe depreciation in the Baht, primarily because of the drastic cutting down of
expenditure, while maintaining basic functionality.

Distribution Upgrading in South Thailand. The re-evaluated value of the EIRR is 14.5% compared to
13% at appraisal. The higher value is primarily due to capital costs being way below appraisal estimates
and tariffs being maintained at financially and economically viable levels.

4.4 Financial rate of return:

The SAR did not calculate the financial rate of return.

4.5 Institutional development impact:

The Project's institutional development impact is rated as high. As a result of several consulting studies
that PEA undertook (see Annex 7) in compliance with the Project's and the Government's mandates to
commercialize and corporatize, a distinct business-oriented culture gradually emerged. This is expected to
mature as PEA becomes a corporation and is listed on the SET. Due to Government's decision to select
electricity utility Governors on a competitive basis and assign them time-bound performance-linked
contracts, there have been discernable improvements in the efficiency of PEA's managerial and technical
operations. Though PEA was prepared to restructure on a "Profit Center" basis, it had to stop short and do
this only on a "Cost Center" basis, as the concept of wholesale competition was put on indefinite hold by
the Government. Finally, PEA's operations have strengthened considerably due to: (a) Transmission
Rationalization which lays down principles for: (i) cost allocation at the interface of PEA and EGAT,
promoting least cost planning; (ii) analyzing technical constraints and operational requirements; and (iii)
demarcating borderlines of ownership and operational responsibilities; and (b) Integration of GIS with
SCADA, which would create an integrated network model that would: (i) assist PEA in managing efficiently
a giant distribution network; (ii) reduce the System Average Interruption Frequency Index for all
customers; and (iii) improve customer service and outage management capabilities.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

Three factors could be cited: First ­ the 1997 economic/financial crisis severely impacted implementation
of: (i) the Distribution Automation component due to budgetary restrictions imposed by the Government
midstream on the procurement process, leading to re-invitation of bids and consequent major delays in
procurement. The implementation of this component was also substantially retarded due to coordination
problems with the Telephone Authority of Thailand; and (ii) the Distribution Upgrading component due to
contractors not being able to marshal financial resources to carry on with their work. The crisis also
resulted in a dramatic reduction in demand which severely tested the financial strength of the utilities and
diluted their resolve to implement projects. Second ­ the California Power crisis, the adverse reports about
operation of the British Power Pool, and EGAT's stiff opposition to the Power Pool concept, all of which
forced the Government to drop introduction of a competitive power market, proposed by the previous
Government (this was not contemplated in the SAR). Third ­ the unexpectedly strong opposition, at the
eleventh hour, from the unions to corporatization and listing of the utilities on the SET, stalling the process.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

While committed to commercialization and privatization per se, the Government had no compulsion to
introduce complex industry restructuring devised by the previous Government in the face of utilities' strong



                                                     - 7 -

opposition. In deference to the utilities' wishes, the Government proposed corporatization and listing of the
three utilities, as a whole, without breaking them up.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

There were two significant factors: (i) lethargy of the organization in implementing the investment
components of the Project when electricity demand growth was declining; and (ii) the general reluctance of
PEA management, backed by PEA's union (as with all the three Thai electricity utilities) to undertake a
major organizational restructuring that would lead to its break up; and (iii) the unexpectedly long decision
time on procurement matters due to PEA's cumbersome procurement process.

5.4 Costs and financing:

The Project completion cost was US$227 million equivalent against an appraisal estimate of US$325
million equivalent, a reduction of about 30%. The Distribution Automation component was implemented at
a cost 22% below appraisal due to: (i) cutting down on embellishments without sacrificing technical
functionality, in response to the budgetary crunch during the financial crisis; and (ii) the Bank's refusal to
accept price negotiations which resulted in re-bidding and lower prices. The cost of the Distribution
Upgrading component was 35% below appraisal estimate due to: (i) depression in international aluminum
prices by 37%; (ii) 22% lower conductor fabrication cost in Thai Baht reflected at 53% in US dollars, due
to severe devaluation of the Baht; and (iii) the highly competitive local construction market during the
financial crisis, which resulted in a transmission cost of B1.242 million/km versus B1.525 million/km
prevailing at appraisal.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

Project overall sustainability is rated as likely. The Project has been constructed to excellent technical
standards and there is little doubt about PEA operating and maintaining it competently. Further, with the
introduction of the Distribution Automation system, PEA's operational efficiency and system reliability
would be significantly enhanced. The physical sustainability of the Project is thus considered highly likely.
PEA's financial objective to ensure financial strength remain and is expected to remain adequate to support
its growth. While Government is resolved to privatize the three electricity utilities by listing them on the
SET and the utilities are willing to go along with the Government mandate, the threat posed to privatization
by the unions, which has currently stalled the process, cannot be underestimated. Hence, while the
sustainability of the restructuring and corporatization aspect of the Project is rated as highly likely, the
sustainability, or rather the achievement of privatization can at best be rated as likely.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

A summary of understandings between the Bank and PEA for reporting on the Project's operational phase
is presented below (see Aide Memoire, Annex 8). PEA would furnish annually to the Bank, for the next
five years, a summary report on the following:

         ·    the utilization (MW and MWh) of the substations financed by the Project;
         ·    the status of monitoring indicators for financial performance, reliability, losses and manpower
         utilization;
         ·    significant events in corporatization and listing of PEA; and
         ·    any events that may adversely affect the physical and policy components of the Project.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

The Bank's performance in Project formulation is rated as satisfactory. Of particular note are: (i) its
engagement of independent consultants to review the complex feasibility study prepared by an equipment
vendor (who proposed that PEA procure the Automation system on a negotiated basis) and pointing out
serious computational flaws; (ii) its recommendation of prequalification and a two-stage bidding process
for the Automation package; and (iii) its insistence on PEA laying out distinct steps for its organizational
restructuring and corporatization - although the phasing and content of this component changed, it
exercised a continuing pressure on PEA to pursue this goal.

7.2 Supervision:

The Bank fielded adequately staffed supervision missions. It displayed flexibility during the
financial/economic crisis. Recognizing the complex nature of the Automation System, the Bank engaged an
independent expert to review the bid documents and the prequalification process. Throughout, the Bank
maintained a substantial level of dialogue, largely informal, with PEA and the Government on pricing,
sector reform, restructuring and privatization. However, it realized that it could not and hence did not
enforce rigid compliance with covenants on organizational restructuring, considering that PEA's actions
were often beyond its control, being mandated by Government policies which kept changing. The Bank
performance is rated as satisfactory.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:

The Bank's overall performance is rated as satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

The Borrower's overall performance is rated as satisfactory. While its exhaustive preparation of the
Automation component and devising the performance monitoring indicators and targets is rated as highly
satisfactory; its less-than-enthusiastic preparation of the restructuring and corporatization component is
rated as satisfactory.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

Government performance is rated as satisfactory. The previous Government aptly handled the utilities
during the economic/financial crisis from which they emerged with sound positions. Its NEPO managed the
Technical Assistance component of the Project with competence. It also conducted far-reaching studies on
restructuring of the Electricity Supply Industry, drafted the Energy Act, finalized the regulatory regime for
the energy sector, formulated the Power Pool Model and secured Cabinet approval for its proposals. It
introduced a new bulk supply tariff and reformed the tariff structure in preparation for Pool operations.
When the new Government stepped in, it required (at the behest of the three Thai electricity utilities,
especially EGAT) the entire Power Industry plan to be reviewed, particularly in regard to ushering-in of
Pool operations by 2003. It later revised the original models of restructuring and corporatization of EGAT,
Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and PEA (which called for a considerable amount of
un-bundling) and directed that the three utilities be privatized (as a whole) by listing on the SET. And, it



                                                     - 9 -

decided to postpone the Power Pool indefinitely and to continue with EGAT as a Single Buyer.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

PEA's overall performance in implementation is rated as satisfactory. Its deployment and exhaustive
training of a competent team of young engineers to handle the Automation component (the team persevered
in spite of insurmountable problems and over a prolonged period beset with utility financial woes) was
exemplary. The performance of the implementation consultant employed by PEA was of an exceptionally
high standard, without which this Project could not have been brought to a successful closure. PEA's
performance in solving very complex communication problems and resolving ROW issues - is rated as
highly satisfactory. Its implementation of the restructuring and corporatization component is rated as
satisfactory.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

Overall, the Borrower's performance is rated as satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

The following are key lessons learned from this Project:

         · Preparation: Major restructuring, corporatization and privatization of a utility, should provide
             for flexibility, as such actions are often beyond the utility's control, being subject to mandates
             which may change with a change of Government. Marshalling of highly competent experts in
             handling technically complex projects such as Automation (especially when previous
             experience is sparse) cannot be over-emphasized.
         · Economic/Financial: Sudden economic/financial crisis in a country could severely impact
             power demand and could render major distribution investments planned for high sustained
             growth levels, totally unviable. Under such conditions, utilities need to be nimble and take
             timely and drastic measures to restructure their investment plans, exercise great financial
             discipline, and double efforts towards improving operational efficiency. Under these
             circumstances, the Bank would do well to take a flexible and sympathetic approach to
             Government actions and desist from demanding rigid compliance with covenants.
         · Power Sector Reforms: Introduction of complex power pool operations in a developing
             country needs to be thought through with care.           The Thai experience showed that full
             liberalization promised only small efficiency gains (the utilities were already efficient) and the
             costs and risks to justify them proved quite elusive. It was apparent that full liberalization was
             not needed to solve the issues that remain the key concerns of policy makers: the fiscal and
             financial performance of the Thai ESI. Creating a power pool market in a system with
             entrenched bureaucracies and special interest groups did not bring early wins. Active support
             rather than reluctant acquiescence of the utilities is necessary to push through a complex
             reform agenda. The Bank could best play the role of advisor and facilitator for countries that
             have embarked on the path of power sector reforms and should recognize that restructuring
             proposals cannot be cast in stone and could change as Government and utility thinking evolves.

10. Additional Information

Course of Power Sector Reforms (see Annex 10 for details)

 In early 2000, NEPO proposed the creation of a "Competitive Power Pool," departing from the earlier
plan of unbundling EGAT and creating a Single Buyer structure. It proposed a gradual restructuring of
EGAT, PEA and MEA to create an ESI with wholesale competition by 2003. In regard to distribution, a
natural monopoly, it proposed that: (i) access to the wires and tariff levels will be subject to regulation; (ii)
all but a few large consumers would purchase electricity from the (DisCos) of regulated regional
monopolies or Regulated Electricity Delivery Companies (REDCos), and pay for this electricity either
through the REDCos, (SupplyCos) or Competitive Retailers (RetailCos); and (iii) the retail supply function
would be provided by DisCos/SupplyCos or by independent supply companies/RetailCos.

PEA's original plan for corporatization and privatization called for clear separation among DisCos,
SupplyCos and Non-core businesses. It involves the separation of its operating units into five categories:
(a) Regional Network Operations, covering network related functions; (b) Regional Regulated Retail
covering supply to customers; (c) Competitive Retail and Market Development, covering supply on a
competitive basis; (d) Ventures, covering existing and future non-core business; and (e) Support Services,
covering support and administrative functions. The separation of Network Operations from Regulated
Retail Operations would only be on an accounting basis (cost-center mode) and not on the basis of creating
separate legal entities (profit center mode). Potential legal separation could be ushered in later when the
ESI and the Government are prepared for it.

In May 2001 the new Government initiated a complete review of the previous Government's Power Sector
policy and decided to postpone the Energy Act approved by the previous Cabinet. In parallel, EGAT
(sensitized by the California Power Crisis) did some serious rethinking on the creation of a Power Pool by
2003 and advocated a "Third Party Grid Access" model, wherein ownership and operation of the grid
would still be with EGAT but competitors would be allowed to use it, on non-discriminatory terms. In
February 2001 the new Government announced an Agenda on Privatization, which called for listing 16
SOEs on the SET, from 2001 to 2003 (EGAT in the 3rd Quarter and MEA and PEA in the 4th Quarter of
2003).

A Ministry of Energy (MOE) was created on October 1, 2002 comprising five departments ­ Office of the
Minister, Office of the Permanent Secretary, Department of Petroleum Resources, Department of Energy
Business, Department of Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation and Energy Policy and Planning
Office (EPPO) which replaces the erstwhile NEPO.

Subsequently, EGAT, MEA, PEA and the Government decided to drop NEPO's "Power Pool" model.
EPPO proposed a new model: (i) split EGAT into three PowerGens; (ii) create an Independent System
Operator (ISO); (iii) create a Transmission Company (GridCo); (iv) create an Independent Regulator; and



                                                    - 11 -

(v) separate "network" and "retail" functions within MEA and PEA. Disagreeing with EPPO's model,
EGAT proposed an alternative model (i) up to 30% of total demand to operate in a "free market" under a
Power Exchange; (ii) EGAT would maintain the generation functions, and ability to contract power under
new Power Purchase Agreements for future GenCos; (iii) EGAT would maintain the transmission and
system control functions; (iv) MEA and PEA could buy power only from EGAT; and (v) residential,
commercial and small industrial consumers would purchase power from MEA and PEA. MEA and PEA
broadly supported EPPO's model but strongly opposed EGAT's model. The Government called for a wider
debate on the subject. Government's latest decision is to put the Power Pool model on an indefinite hold
and proceed with corporatization and listing of the three Thai electricity utilities on the SET.

An unexpected development in June 2004 was the strong opposition from EGAT and later the MEA and
PEA unions to listing of the utilities on the SET. In response, the Government has commissioned another
study to review the corporatization and privatization process and is also engaged in revising the
Corporatization Act. The corporatization of PEA can be expected towards the end of 2005; the date of its
privatization is uncertain.

Additional Annex 10. Restructuring of the Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) Corporation
of PEA

Chronological sequence of events in restructuring of the ESI and corporatization of PEA:

1997-1998

·  January 1997 - PEA Board approves the new organization structure for FY 97.
·  March 1997­ Ministry of Finance (MoF) approves Senior Management positions.
·  PEA initiates the necessary accounting studies to develop cost accounting procedures and cost
   recording systems to facilitate cost separation.
·  Application made for classification of PEA as a good state enterprise (GSE) - a status necessary to
   empower PEA's management for successful transformation to the new organizational structure and
   enhancing operational efficiency.
·  April 1997 ­ A New Cabinet Resolution forces PEA to change its restructuring process. PEA submits
   an entirely new plan to the Ministry of Interior, comprising:

   o Phase 1 (1996-1998) - Formation of regional distribution units as cost centers with transparent
       cost allocation. Units are to be granted greater operational autonomy and headed by Deputy
       Governors. Certain headquarters functions are to be decentralized to the regions. PEA to achieve
       GSE status.
   o Phase 2 (1998-1999) - Transformation of the regional distribution cost centers to utility profit
       centers.    Non-core functions to be separated and transactions with the regional utility profit
       centers to be on full cost transfer prices.
   o Phase 3 (2000) - Regional utility profit centers to be formed as separate corporate subsidiaries
       under a PEA holding company, which will provide limited central services and policy guidance to
       the utility subsidiaries.

       Observations: The four PEA regional units are no longer envisaged for formation initially as
       profit centers and subsequently as subsidiary companies. Instead only the service function of
       billing and collection will be formed as regional subsidiary companies, with distribution
       operations retained within PEA. In essence the core wires business in the four regions will be
       retained within PEA with no clear indication of progress towards a decentralized corporate
       structure.

1998-1999

·  Severe financial constraints prevent PEA achieving GSE status.
·  September 1998 - Government approves a new Master Plan for State Enterprise Reform (which
   includes privatization of the electricity utilities), prepared at the behest of the IMF. The Plan
   essentially maintains the structural changes proposed earlier, and lays down the following key target
   dates:

   o End-1999                -   PEA to prepare a new Action Plan proposing an organizational structure
       and implementation plan.
   o December 2000           -   Non-core activities established as business units.
   o December 2001           -   PEA reorganized into regional distribution units. Distribution and supply
       established as cost centers.



                                                   - 39 -

   o Mid-2004               -   PEA regional distribution units corporatized.
   o From Dec 2004          -   PEA distribution companies and non-core subsidiaries privatized.

1999 ­ 2000

·  NEPO's Power Pool Study leads to radical rethinking on ESI restructuring. Intensive discussions
   follow between PEA and NEPO on the future shape of PEA. PEA proposes the following strategy:

   o PEA would by end-2003 be restructured to form 12 separate low-voltage (i.e. below 22kV)
       regulated distribution companies, with the 22kV and above network remaining within a
       state-owned PEA as four separate business units.
   o After 2003, the corporatization of the 12 regulated distribution companies as corporatized
       companies would be pursued.

   Observations: Not only is the fundamental restructuring of PEA been delayed further by the Power
   Pool Study, the expected restructuring does not lead to the creation of multiple separate regional
   distribution companies as agreed with the Bank in 1996, although the corporatization of low voltage
   distribution into multiple entities is definitely a positive development.

2000 -2001

·  Significant Progress in ESI restructuring following NEPO's Power Pool Study:

   o Electricity Supply Industry (ESI): Progress in ESI restructuring: (a) the legal framework and
       implementation of the ESI as embodied in the Energy Act is drafted and approved by the Cabinet
       in October 2000; (b) the Cabinet also approves in October 2000, the market structure of the ESI
       proposed by NEPO; (c) NEPO sets up working groups to draft Secondary Legislation; and (d) the
       tariff structure is completely changed, incorporating several reform objectives, including the
       consideration of efficiency gains in the bulk supply tariff and the transparent calculation of cross
       subsidies between the distribution utilities.
   o Distribution: Distribution will be restructured as: (a) access to the wires and tariff levels will be
       subject to regulation; (b) all but a few large consumers would purchase electricity from the
       Distribution Companies (DisCos) of regulated regional monopolies or Regulated Electricity
       Delivery Companies (REDCOs), and pay for this electricity either through the REDCOs, Supply
       Companies (SupplyCOs) or Competitive Retailers (RetailCos); and (c) the retail supply function
       would be provided by DisCos/SupplyCos or by independent supply companies/RetailCos.
   o PEA's Restructuring. While agreeing with NEPO's restructuring proposals which called for
       disaggregating PEA into smaller units, PEA proposes that a transitional structure be allowed with
       the following features and timing: By FY00-02: (a) PEA would remain a state enterprise; (b) the
       wires activities (22kV and above) to be reorganized into 4 Network Business Units of PEA; (c) the
       existing 12 areas to be reorganized into 12 REDCOs within PEA which will operate the retail
       business including metering, billing and supply function of buying power from the pool and selling
       to consumers within their areas; and (d) the non-core business to be organized as autonomous BUs
       (NSBs or non-core NSBs). By FY03-onwards: (a) REDCOs and NSBs to be corporatized and
       possibly privatized; and (b) if performance, efficiency and reliability standards are not met,
       corporatize the 4 Network BUs.
   o PEA establishes Steering Committees on unbundling non-core activities and services, including
       development of new accounting systems. In Oct 2000, PEA's Board approves the transformation of



                                                     - 40 -

       the Construction and Maintenance Unit as a (BU). The study to convert the Business Engineering
       Unit into an autonomous BU is commenced.

2001-2002

·  The new Government starts reviewing the previous Government's Power Sector policy. It announces an
   Agenda on Privatization, which proposes bringing profit-oriented state enterprises under a National
   Holding Company, which would oversee the privatization process. It is subsequently agreed to proceed
   with the preparation of a Plan for listing 16 SOEs on the SET, from 2001 to 2003 including EGAT in
   the 3rd Quarter of 2003 and of MEA and PEA in the 4th Quarter of 2003.
·  PEA's reorganized structure is not materially affected by ESI restructuring - PEA's 12 electric
   administration areas are grouped into 4 regions (for North, Northeast, Central and Southern), each
   headed by a Deputy Governor.         Six deputy governors for Planning and System Development,
   Organization Development, Corporate Services, Economics and Finance, Construction and
   Maintenance, and Business Engineering comprise PEA's non-core activities
·   PEA's next steps to further the restructuring process and the detailed action plan for the activities in
   each of the transitional years are approved by NEPO in March 2001. PEA retains consultant to advise
   it on the details of the planned activities to FY03, including performance targets, unbundling costs,
   management development and performance improvement, HR and IT strategies and issues, commercial
   and financial management systems development, etc.
·  PEA commissions the following 6 studies. One - An Engineering Business Unit Study (to convert the
   Engineering Business Departments into Business Units) by the Chulalangkorn University (Intellectual
   Property Institute). Two - A study to setup the Construction and Maintenance Business Unit. Three -
   A study on Accounting Systems Development by the Chulalangkorn University. Four - The study on
   Restructuring of PEA's Core Business (to un-bundle core and non-core activities and services). Five -
   The Human Resources System Development Study. Six ­ Appointment of advisors for listing PEA on
   the Stock Market.
·  Earlier models formulated for the future structure of PEA are reviewed by consultants undertaking
   Study 4 and a new model is recommended ­ the Hybrid Model, which involves the separation of PEA
   into five separate areas or operating units (OUs) ­ Network Operations (4 Regional units) covering all
   network distribution related functions; Regulated Retail (4 Regional units) responsible for supplying
   electricity to all customers as provider of the last resort; Competitive Retail and Market Development
   responsible for supplying electricity on a competitive basis; Ventures covering existing and future
   non-core businesses; and Support Services covering services such as finance, legal, IT and HR. This
   model is expected to operate in the short to medium term and facilitate transition to any subsequent
   structure that requires further appropriate separations, e.g. between networks and retail and regulated
   and competitive retail. Network Operations and Regulated Retail would operate in a regulated
   environment while Competitive Retail would operate in a competitive environment. The model would
   facilitate management of a uniform national tariff as long as the Government so wishes, maximize
   enterprise value due to a clear demarcation between subsidized and non-subsidized operations and
   introduce competition by enabling competitive retailers. The basic structure of the model is approved
   by NEPO.
·  MoF agrees to extend PEA listing date to 2004, to enhance enterprise value.

2002-2003

·  Significant events in this period comprise:

   o Ministry of Energy:        A new Ministry of Energy (MOE) is established on October 1, 2002,
      comprising ­ Office of the Minister, Office of the Permanent Secretary, Department of Petroleum
      Resources, Department of Energy Business, Department of Renewable Energy and Energy
      Conservation and (EPPO).
   o Energy Act and ESI Reforms: The Energy Act (approved in FY00 by the previous Parliament) was
      crafted on the basis of a NEPO-proposed ESI model that envisaged introduction of a fully
      competitive market structure operating as a power pool by FY04. The three power utilities,
      particularly EGAT, had serious concerns about this model in regard to: (a) unfettered competition
      and prevention of market abuse; (b) price stability; (c) system security and sufficiency of supply;
      (d) impact on rural electrification; (e) subsidization of low-income users and the future of uniform
      national tariffs; and (f) compliance and coordination with the Government's Privatization Plan and
      timetable. EGAT's reservations about the model were exacerbated by the California power trading
      crisis, the collapse of Enron and the lessons learned from UK experience with power pools. In
      August 2002, at the behest of EGAT, the Government agreed to review the ESI reforms and
      instructed the Council of State to hold clearance of the Energy Act.
   o New ESI Reforms : Following unanimous decision by EGAT, MEA, PEA and the Government to
      move away from the "power pool" model, the MOE instructed concerned parties to finalize by
      November 2002 a new model to replace the power pool.
   o The NESA Model: A New Electricity Supply Arrangements (NESA) model was propounded by
      EPPO, which while doing away with the power pool, maintains wholesale and retail competition. It
      proposed: (a) splitting up of EGAT into PowerGen. 1, PowerGen. 2 and PowerGen. 3; (b)
      creation of an Independent System Operator (ISO); (c) creation of a Transmission Company
      (GridCo); (d) creation of an Independent Regulator; and (e) separation of "network" and "retail"
      functions within MEA and PEA. The model allows for the functioning of private retail companies.
      Trading would be permitted through bilateral contracts between any one of the - PowerGens,
      Independent Power Producers, Small Power Producers and new GenCos - on the one hand and any
      one of the retailers - DisCos (MEA and PEA) and direct customers - on the other. This model was
      acceptable to MEA and PEA, with the proviso that separation of "network" and "retail" functions
      would only be through a separation of accounting systems and not through creation of separate
      legal entities (the latter according to MEA and PEA would be impractical in the near term apart
      from entailing increased expenses). The model was not acceptable to EGAT. Its key concerns
      were: (a) the separation of generation into smaller entities could make the Thai generation industry
      vulnerable to increased foreign ownership (via cross holdings and mergers and acquisitions -
      similar to the UK privatization experience) a conflicting goal of the Thailand privatization plan; (b)
      because the Thai power sector is small in comparison with other global competitive power markets,
      economies of scale could not be achieved; (c) Thailand would not be able to play a lead role in the
      ASEAN grid if EGAT is marginalized; and (d) difficulty in meeting the Government's privatization
      schedule if EGAT has to be split up prior to its listing on the SET. A common concern of the three
      utilities is the functioning of competitive markets in a regime where uniform national tariffs are
      mandated by Government policy, which would necessitate introduction of a cumbersome
      subsidizing mechanism.
   o EGAT Partial Liberalization Model: With the stated objectives of ensuring security and sufficiency
      of supply and assuming an active role in spearheading ASEAN grid integration, EGAT proposed a
      model which called for a partial and gradual liberalization of the ESI. Under the model: (a) up to



                                                   - 42 -

       30% of total demand could be allowed to operate in a "free market" under a Power Exchange.
       Large industrial consumers could contract for supply either from EGAT or from GenCos with
       existing PPA or from future GenCos or from MEA and PEA; (b) EGAT would maintain the
       generation function, its present PPA with GenCos, and ability to contract power under new PPAs
       for future GenCos; (c) EGAT would maintain the transmission and system control functions; (d)
       MEA and PEA could buy power only from EGAT; and (e) residential, commercial and small
       industrial consumers would purchase power from MEA and PEA. MEA and PEA strongly
       opposed EGAT's model on the grounds that: (a) they could potentially lose 30% (demand-wise) of
       their large customers; (b) EGAT would be a dominant player in the ESI, with the clout to
       potentially capture a large proportion of the supply market; (c) the wholesale market would not
       function well as the wholesale price of power would be determined by the dominant entity, EGAT
       (the large industrial consumers would have little incentive to buy directly from GenCos); (d)
       majority of the consumers will not have choice of cheaper suppliers; (e) the parallel market, thus
       created, would result in a competitive price enjoyed by large customers at the expense of the 70%
       of consumers who buy directly from the MEA and PEA.; and (f) the issues of a clear subsidized
       mechanism for social responsibilities and the national uniform tariffs would still be unresolved.
   o Current Impasse: To resolve the impasse between EGAT on one hand and MEA, PEA and EPPO
       on the other, the Government called for a wider debate on the subject.
   o Privatization Program: Notwithstanding the current impasse in finalization of the ESI model,
       Government's program for listing of EGAT, MEA and PEA on the SET was maintained - listing:
       EGAT (2004 Q1); PEA (2004 ­ Q3) and MEA (2004 ­ Q2).

·  PEA proceeds with its corporatization and privatization plans in line with the NESA model which calls
   for clear separation among DisCos, SupplyCos and Non-core businesses. PEA's current restructuring
   plan calls for the reorganization of PEA in 3 stages, with the final phase to be the development of a
   hybrid model, involving the separation of its operating units into five categories: (a) Regional Network
   Operations, covering all network distribution related functions; (b) Regional Regulated Retail covering
   the supply of electricity to all customers; (c) Competitive Retail and Market Development, covering the
   supply of electricity on competitive basis; (d) Ventures, covering existing and future non-core business;
   and (e) Support Services, covering support and administrative functions. The separation of Network
   Operations from Regulated Retail Operations would only be on an accounting basis and not on the
   basis of creating separate legal entities. NESA agreed to this as a first step, with potential legal
   separation later.

2003-2004

·  Consensus not yet reached on the final model for restructuring of the ESI. PEA, however, proceeds
   with its corporatization and privatization plan which calls for the reorganization of PEA, involving the
   separation of its operating units into four categories: (a) Regional Network and Regulated Retail
   Operations, covering all network distribution related functions; and the supply of electricity to all
   customers; (b) Competitive Retail and Market Development, covering the supply of electricity on
   competitive basis; (c) Ventures, covering existing and future non-core business; and (d) Support
   Services, covering support and administrative functions. The separation of Network Operations from
   Regulated Retail Operations would only be on an accounting basis and not on the basis of creating
   separate legal entities. Potential legal separation could follow at a later date.
·  Consensus reached in the NEPo Committee meeting on November 26, 2003 on the final model for the.
   This model is termed the Enhanced Single Buyer Model (ESB), whose key features would be:




                                                     - 43 -

 o Account Unbundling between Generation and Transmission and between Distribution and Retail
 o EGAT listed as a whole on the SET, with Government retaining control. Capacity additions
     through competitive bidding overseen by the Regulator.
 o Creation of a Ring-Fenced System Operator within the Transmission Business Unit of EGAT
 o Creation of a strong and effective Regulator to: (a) oversee generation bidding process; (b)
     coordinate long-term system planning; (c) approve PDP,      Grid Code and tariff mechanisms; and
     (d) issue licenses and enforce industry regulations.
 o Clearer Commercial Boundaries between utilities (EGAT, MEA and PEA) with no direct
     customers for EGAT.
 o Promotion of SPPs and Captive Power
 o Listing of MEA and PEA on the SET, as a whole.

· PEA proceeds with its corporatization and privatization plan which calls for the reorganization of PEA.

· Opposition by the Unions: Stiff opposition by the EGAT union (later reinforced by the MEA and PEA
  unions) to Government's proposals to corporatize and subsequently list EGAT, MEA and PEA on the
  SET, stalls the process.
· Notwithstanding the above, PEA's internal processing towards corporatization and privatization is still
  on course and it continues to follow reorganization.
· Government orders another study on corporatization and privatization. In parallel, it starts revising the
  Corporatization Act.

  Observation Considering the current uncertain situation, PEA corporatization can at best be
  expected towards the end of 2005 and possible privatization later.
