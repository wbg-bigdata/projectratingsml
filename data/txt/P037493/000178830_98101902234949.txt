INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO SPAIN
FOR A SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Spain for the equivalent of US$33 million to help finance a second
livestock development project. The loan would have a term of 15 years, in-
cluding 5 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum. The
proceeds of the loan would be relent to livestock farmers for a term of up
to 12 years, including 3 years of grace, with interest at 7 percent for loans
up to 5 million pesetas, and 7.5 percent for loans exceeding 5 million
pesetas. Communal organizations farming other than communal lands would pay
0.5 percent less; communal organizations farming communal lands would pay
b.5 percent on loans of any size.
PART I - ThE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Spain in November/December 1970 and its
report (R71-140), dated May 2u, 1971, hias been distributed to the Executive
Directors. In November 1971 a Bank mission reviewed industrial sector poli-
cies and development. Additional information on the economy was obtained
during a brief visit to Spain in November 1974. Country data are presented
in Annex I.
3.        lhe gradual liberalization and outward orientation of Spain's eco-
iiomic policies since the early 1960's, and the intensification of its econom,ic
links with the European Communities Countries, brought a period of unprecented
economic growth accompanied by far-reaching structural transformation, with
industry and services becoming the leading growth sectors. From 1963 to 1973,
real GNP expanded at an average rate of 6.5 percent a year, with GNP per ca-
pita growing at an annual rate of 5.3 percent to a level of $1,360 in 1973.
Over the same period, the share of the agricultural sector in GDP dropped from
23 to 12 percent, and its share in the labor force from 37 to 27 percent. The
economic expansion not only caused a rapid rise in the standard of living but,
in conjunction with labor migration to Western Europe, virtually eliminated
unemployment.  By the end of 1973, the reported unemployment rate was 1.2
percent, and emerging labor shortages in some regions and activities had led
to a slowdown of net emigration.
4.        Economic growth was accompanied by a strong balance of payments
position. Despite rapidly rising imports the balance on current account has
been in surplus during the early 1970's, due to a high and fast growing level
of exports of goods and services (including tourism and workers' remittances).
Agricultural exports played a major role in the export drive, accounting for
29 percent of total commodity exports in 1973. Together with a continued net



- 2 -
inflow of foreign capital, mostly from private sources, the current surpluses
led to a substantial accumulation of foreign reServes. They increased from
$1.3 billion at the beginning of 1970 to $6.8 billion at the end of 1973,
equivalent to about nine months of commodity imports.
Recent Economic Developments
5.        However, there was a significant worsening in Spain's economic
situation and prospects during 1974 in the wake of the increases in interna-
tional prices for oil and other raw materials. Import prices increased by
42 percent in 1974 while the slowdown in economic activity in Spain's major
trading partners, especially the European Communities, affected the country's
export markets and led to reduced inflows from tourism and workers' remit-
tances. As a result, the current account balance plunged from a surplus of
$560 million in 1973 to an estimated $3,300 million deficit in 1974. higher
oil prices accounted for about two-thirds of the deterioration while price in-
creases for other primary products, especially foodstuffs, added significant-
ly to the import bill. Export prices rose more slowly (by about 23 percent)
thus leaving the country with sharply deteriorated terms of trade.
6.        The steep rise of import prices reinforced the inflationary pressure
already existing as a result of the business boom that had started in 1972.
Wholesale prices rose by almost 20 percent from September 1973 to September
1974, or about twice the rate in 1973. The increase in the cost of living
also accelerated, although at a slightly slower pace. The monetary author-
ities reacted strongly to the inflationary threat and succeeded in reducing
the expansion of the money supply. In this they were assisted significantly
by the changed balance of payments situation, which drained liquidity from
the banking system, and by a general slowdown of business activity that
began to be felt in mid-1974. Industrial production, which had still grown
at an annual rate of 14 percent in the first half of 1974 was expected to
rise by about 6-8 percent during the second half. The turn-down in business
activity was initiated by domestic factors, such as a decline in residential
construction, but was due mainly to the changed external situation. The
bad tourist season further weakened the construction industry. Higher fuel
prices caused cutbacks in automobile production, one of the major industries
in Spain. Uncertainty about the trends in domestic and foreign markets,
together with the tight monetary policy, led to a deterioration in the invest-
ment climate.
7.        The present situation is therefore one of economic retrenchment.
Unemploymienit is becoming a major policy issue as net emigration has declined
sharply. The large deficit in the balance of payments is likely to persist
for some time, even thoughi the growth of imports can be expected to decelerate
sharply and some improvement in the terms of trade may take place.  Exports,
althougih on the whole still highly competitive, are unlikely to remain an
important growth factor until economic activity in Western Europe revives.
Faced with these problems, the Government has to achieve a delicate balance
between anti-inflationary measures and steps to maintain economic activity
and employment at acceptable levels. A program of action recently proclaimed
by tlhe authorities envisages increased public investment in labor-intensive



-3-
projects. The already liberal legislation for foreign investors will be fur-
ther improved and incentives will also be given to stimulate residential con-
struction.  Measures to economize fuel consumption have been put into force
as of November 1, 1974.   With the help of this program the Government expects
to maintain a real growth rate of GNP around 4 percent during 1975, and to
keep unemployment below 2 percent of the labor force. The current deficit in
the balance of payments is likely to be somewhat lower than in 1974 while the
rate of inflation should slow down with the reduced pressure from import prices.
Development Objectives
8.        Spain's long-term development objectives will have to be adjusted
to the changed economic situation. The Third Development Plan (1972-75) now
entering its final year has already led to important structural reforms. Em-
phasis is given to the industrial sector in the expectation of further econo-
mic integration with the European Communities, following a Preferential Trade
Agreement concluded in 1970. For the first time, Spanish planning also in-
cludes measures to combat environmental pollution and to improve industrial
research and make it more responsive to the markets for industrial products.
In agriculture, efforts are concentrated on the development of livestock,
feed grains and oil seeds to substitute domestic production for rapidly rising
imports. Attention is also given to discrepancies in income distribution,
especially at the regional level, through the promotion of growth centers
in the less-developed areas.
9.        Whlile some of these objectives (such as pollution control or urban
development) have become less urgent in the light of present economic condi-
tions, new ones have emerged that claim high priority. One is a long-term
program to develop Spain's energy resources, which was announced last October.
Oil, virtually all of it imported, accounts at present for 58 percent of the
country's primary energy requirements. In industry and transport, the share
of oil consumption is even higher (77 percent). The new program envisages
a thorough exploration of domestic oil and gas resources, with the aim of
covering a significant share of total requirements from local production by
1985. In addition, efforts are being m,ade to accelerate the development of
local coal and hydro-power resources, and to expand greatly the supply of
nuclear energy.
10.       Although the Tlird Plan's overall growth target of 7 percent per
annum will not be achieved, due to the recent slowdown in economic activity,
its public investment program of $13.5 billion will be implemented and may,
in fact, be exceeded. The bulk of these investments is directed towards trans-
port, agriculture, education, urban development, and more recently towards hous-
ing and energy. The share of foreign financing, initially envisaged to be
rather small ($0.6 billion per year), rose significantly in the course of 1974,
as public enterprises were encouraged by the authorities to rely increasingly
on external funds.



-4-
External Assistance
11.       The net inflow of medium- and long-term capital averaged some $730
million per year during 1971-73. Direct investment and real estate purchases
accounted for the bulk of the total while official aid had ceased to be a
source of external financing. During 1974 the net inflow of foreign capital
is expected to have tripled ($2.5 billion). Most of the additional funds
were mobilized in the Euromarket, mainly by public enterprises, and no dif-
ficulties were encountered in raising the much larger amounts. In the next
few years, the need for large scale foreign borrowing is expected to continue
and attempts will be made to approach directly some of the oil exporting
surplus countries.
12.       Total medium- and long-term public debt outstanding and disbursed
at the end of 1973 amounted to $1,536 million, with Bank loans accounting
for 13 percent of the total. Debt service payments were estimated at $365
million for 1973, or about 3.2 percent of gross foreign exchange earnings in
that year. Amortization and interest on Bank loans amounted to about 6 per-
cent of total debt service in 1973. Including service payments for private
debt, the debt service ratio is estimated at 10.7 percent. Although future
debt service ratios could rise significantly as a result of the much larger
external capital requirements, Spain continues to be creditworthy for conven-
tional borrowing in substantial amounts.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SPAIN
13.       The proposed loan, the Bank's eleventh operation in Spain and the
second for livestock development, would bring total Bank lending to $460 mil-
lion. The amount outstanding and held by the Bank as of January, 31, 1975
was $368.8 million, of which $138.8 million was undisbursed.
14.       Five loans, totalling $328 million, have been made in the trans-
portation sector, one for highways ($33 million), three for railways ($205
million), and two for ports ($90 million). The Highways Loan of 1963 (No.
360-SP) which financed road improvements also made provision for a pilot
highway maintenance program, as a first step towards a nationwide maintenance
system. The autonomous State Railways (RENFE), recipient of three Bank loans
in 1964 (No. 387-SP), 1967 (No. 507-SP) and 1971 (No. 772-SP), has been trans-
formed from an obsolete enterprise into a modern and efficient railway system
that now compares favorably with other European railways. A performance audit
of the Railways loans (dated December 27, 1974) by the Operations Evaluation
Department notes the good results achieved by RENFE and attributes them to
RENFE's internal efficiency, the suitability of the Bank's approach and its
sustained and timely attention, the quality of the consultants' work and the
fact that they remained for the several years required, and the rapid growth
of the Spanish economy, which facilitated absorption of personnel eliminated
from RENFE and maintained total demand for transport services. The two



- 5 -
Ports Loans (Nos. 429-SP of 1965 and 885-SP of 1973) brought about major
institutional and financial changes, especially with respect to financial
viability, port administration and the preparation of port development plans.
15.       The Bank made two agricultural loans, a $25 million loan for live-
stock development in 1969 (discussed in paragraphs 22-24) and a $12.7 million
loan for agricultural research in 1971. The purpose of the latter was to
raise the standard of agricultural research through the restructuring of the
key official research organization, INIA (Instituto Nacional de Investiga-
ciones Agronomicas) and reorienting its research activity on a commodity-
oriented basis. This was the first project of this type undertaken by the
Bank. Execution of this project was delayed by a time-consuming reorganiza-
tion of INIA during which the government's financial and administrative sup-
port for the project was inadequate. Considerable improvement in implementa-
tion followed the appointment of a new director for INIA in April 1974.
16.       The Bank has also made two loans for education, in 1970 and 1972,
totalling $62 million. There have been frequent changes in the leadership
of the Education Ministry, and significant uncertainty concerning the Govern-
ment's intention to implement the reform program. The Government does not
intend to adhere to the standard of student accommodations envisaged in the
projects, including the resources devoted to pre-technical training, which
in the Bank's judgment are a key element in the educational reform. Conse-
quently, the Bank has not accepted the revisions proposed by the Government,
and at the request of the Government the undisbursed balance of these loans
amounting to $61.5 million was cancelled on March 25, 1975. Annex II con-
tains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of January 31,
1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
17.       Despite the expected deterioration in Spain's balance of payments
in the short- and medium-run, its reserves, export potfntial and access to
foreign capital markets should ensure that there are no serious constraints
to financing its development program. Considering its relatively high level
of economic development and per capita income, Spain is approaching the stage
where it no longer needs the financial support of the Bank. Limited Bank as-
sistance, especially at the technical level, would still be helpful in direct-
ing Spain's own resources into areas needing further development. The present
project provides an example of this assistance. Only one further operation
is contemplated, namely a loan to assist Spain in financing an innovative
project aimed at developing a market-oriented industrial research strategy.
While this project, planned for FY76, would greatly strengthen Spain's ca-
pacity to develop industrial processes and products needed for its own econ-
omy, it also is of special interest for the Bank because of its pioneering
character. Spain offers especially suitable conditions under which to estab-
lish such a venture, and from it the Bank expects to gain valuable experience
applicable to the development of industry in other less-developed countries.

18.       IFC has made investinents in four Spanish enterprises totalling
$18.8 million (see Annex II, page 2). The loans to Fabrica Espanola Magnetos,
S.A. (FEMSA) (an automotive electrical equipment manufacturer), Banco del
Desarrollo Economico Espanol, S.A. (BANDESCO), Industrias del Papel y de la
Celulosa, S.A. (INPACSA), a pulp and paper manufacturer, have been fully dis-
bursed, and repaid, and IFC has sold its share-holdings in these enterprises.
A loan of $4.4 million to Industrias de Tableros y de Derivados de Madera was
signed June 21, 1974, with an IFC equity participation of $0.9 million, the
total amounting to $5.3 million. IFC does not have any new projects under
consideration.
PART III - THE LIVESTOCK SECTOR
19.       Compared to Spain's overall economic development, agricultural
development has been slow. Despite some progress in increasing farm produc-
tivity, per capita agricultural incon.e throughout Spain is still less than
40 percent of the average income in other sectors and, while it has been
increasing, the rate of growth is also below that in other sectors.    rne in-
come of the farm population is, therefore, falling behind. These income
differences are far more accentuated in the northwest, i.e. in the ,four
provinces of Galicia, the poorest region in Spain and the relative income
position of which has been deteriorating. In 1971, production per person em-
ployed in agriculture in the more advanced provinces ranged from $1,875 to
$2,364 per year, while in the four Galician provinces it ranged from $521 to
$672.
20.       In 1973, livestock accounted for 38 percent of agricultural output.
Cattle population amounted to 4.25 million, an increase of about 14 percent
since 1965; pig population was 7.2 million, an increase of 26 percent in the
same period and sheep population was 17.8 million, a decrease of 15 percenc
from 1965.
21.       Rising incomes in Spain, coupled with the growing tourist industry,
increased the demand for meat, particularly beef and veal, during the early
sixties. A large portion of these increases has been met by imports. Agri-
cultural imports have been increasing at an annual rate of 14.4 percent and
now account for about 20-22 percent of total imports. Between 30-50 percent
of agricultural imports consist of meat and products for use in livestock
raising. Meat consumption is expected to increase by 25 percent and to
reach more than 2 million tons by 1980. Despite higher domestic production,
this will lead to an increasing gap. High world prices for meat and feed
grains would make closing this gap with imports very costly and undesirable.
This situation, together with limitations on expanding the area under cereals
and the very sharp rise in fertilizer prices, point to the need to intensify
efforts to expand domestic meat production through pasture development.



-7 -
22.       Assisted by the Bank's First Livestock Development Loan of 1969, the
government launched a program to initiate major changes in livestock production
and to provide the basis for the further expansion of Spain's livestock sub-
sector. For these purposes the Bank project emphasized technical assistance
so that improved technology could be introduced to increase the carrying capa-
city of the farms and the productivity of the herds. The principal focus of
the project was the establishment of legume based pastures in the dryland
zone of the southwest. Part of the northern region was also included, but on
a pilot basis only and concentrated on smaller livestock farms, to point the
way to possible further large-scale development.
23.       Under this first project, producers borrow to invest in livestock
production on the basis of farm plans approved by the Livestock Development
Agency (LDA) which was established to appraise and supervise sub-loans and to
provide technical services to the farmers participating in the project. The
interest rate for sub-loans was 6.5 percent plus 0.5 percent technical assis-
tance fee. Farmers could obtain credit from participating private savings
banks and the Banco de Credito Agricola (BCA), the agricultural lending agency
of the Instituto de Credito Oficial (ICO), which is in turn responsible to
the Ministry of Finance.   The private credit institutions and the BCA could
obtain up to 100 percent reimbursement for their sub-loans from the Special
Project Fund established for this purpose in ICO, which in turn could withdraw
56 percent of such expenditures from the Bank loan. While the program has not
been in operation long enough for herds to reach their full expected size,
production data from a sample of 54 farms, representing different types of
operations which have completed their investment programs, show that the
output of saleable livestock has increased 320 percent from cattle breeding
farms, 350 percent from sheep farms, and 550 percent from mixed cattle and
sheep operations over and above their levels of production before development.
24.       In addition to providing credit and technical.eassistance, the first
project also aimed to reduce the high proportion of cattle slaughtered as
calves, and thus encourage the production of older and heavier cattle. Accord-
ingly measures were taken to help supply breeding stock to the project and to
modify progressively meat import and marketing policies. The Livestock Pro-
curement Service (LPS) was established and operated by LDA with support from
the veterinarians of the Agriculture Ministry. The first project also provi-
ded for liberalization of import restrictions on beef and veal and greater
efficiency in meat price support operations. The Government has made policy
changes: prohibitions have been placed on slaughtering calves below minimum
weights, price incentives were introduced which resulted in a sharply in-
creased weight of slaughtered cattle and government market activity in beef
has been reduced.
25.       The Government also has other programs that relate to or complement
the LDA livestock program. Credit for livestock producers (but without the
technical assistance which is a major feature of the first Bank project) has
also been available from other Ministry of Agriculture sources; the Instituto
de Reforma y Desarrollo Agrario (IRYDA) and Accion Concertada (AC). Research



in pasture development is also being carried out with Bank assistance unau;-
the 1971 Agricultural Research Loan and contributes to expanding the feed
base for livestock production.
26.       Despite the government's ertor s to increase agricultural incoriue
institutIonal and struzrural problems sLill exist, particularly in the .tre
humid region of the nortt. T'here, extensive areas remain to be develope6
while the climate is exceptionally favorable for pasture production, oftering
excellent opportunities to expand livestock farming.    The region's natural
advantages for such development are now vitiated by problems of land tenure
and farm structure.   Nirie-y percent of the farms in Galicia are 10l ha. or
less.  Fragmentation o- tHrs is excessive     an individual farm of J ha : iSv
consist of 14 or more sepdrate plots of land.   Many farms have been abanc:cec
and consequently become overgrown with underbrush, mostly gorse. OC speciai
interest are 2-2.5 million ha. of communally-owned grazing lands, (incliuding
1.2 million ha. of scrub lands in Galicia), now ineffectively used, buc
capable of development. The government has issued a series of decrees
regulating the use of these lands, culminating in a new land Reform Law in
1973. The Government is taking measures to bring these lands into produc-
tion, and in connectioi witrn the proposed project, a start will be mad- or:
developing them into cattiLe production and fattening farms.
PAf:l rV - THE PROJECT
27.       The proposed project, which is summarized in Annex IIl and detcribed
in detail in the report "Appraisal of Second Livestock Development Projec-''
No. 544a-SP, dated February 28, 1975 was appraised in March 1974.    Negotia-
tions were held in W-ishingtun iri February 1975.  The Spanisn delegation was
led by Mr. Claudic GaUkdarias, Director general, Ministry of Agriculture. 
included representative:, oI thne Ministries of Commerce and Finance.
Project Description
28.       This second project is a logical follow-up to the first BanK asisred
project.  The proposed loan of $33 million, most of which would go to the l
developed area in the northwest, would serve to mobilize an additional $1i6
million within Spain to meet the total cost of the project, which wouid have
the following objectivesz:
(a)  It would reinfofce and expand the application of the technological
innovations begun under the first projiect, for example, the estab-
lishment of legw-based p,astures through the introduction of sub-
terranean clover.   ilWe dissemination of new agricultural tech-
nology through technical assistance and demorntration is a ioig-rerm
task.  After fc'ar years operations in the southwest the LDA has
developed an etfective staff and a successful approach to local
farmers. It should now expand into new areas but its staff needs
the additional years of support that the second project would pro-
vide in terms of technical assistance and financing.



- 9 -
(b) It would increase meat and milk production based on pasture
rather than feed grains. The need to reduce the meat deficit is
now even more urgent than at the time of the first loan, due
to the long-term world shortages of meat and especially of feed
grains, which are also urgently needed for human consumption,
and due to rising prices of imports. Increased production can
be fairly quickly achieved in the southwest, where the program
is already established, and accordingly the second project
continues and expands the program in that area.
(c) It would introduce institutional changes in land tenure arrange-
ments to promote the exploitation of the agricultural resources
in the underdeveloped Galicia region, such as the formation of
associations of owners to develop communally-owned lands. There
the focus will be quite different. While the area to be developed
by the project would be relatively small (22,700 ha.) compared
with the southwest (289,000 ha.), the project would aim to solve
critically important land tenure and structural farm problems
which are presently holding up the development of the potentially
most productive region in Spain for livestock (see paragraph 26).
Once these problems are resolved, and the farming community is
able to observe the results of improved technology based on estab-
lished pastures in a high rainfall area, some 1.2 million ha. of
communally-owned scrub lands now ineffectively used could be
developed for meat and milk production. The project is designed
to set a substantial example leading to this development. Such.
development in the higher rainfall area of the north would go a
long way towards meeting Spain's deficit in meat and milk, as well
as markedly improving farm incomes in one of the poorest regions
of the country.
29.       Credit would be provided for the establishment of improved pastures,
fencing, farm buildings, farm machinery, watering facilities, on-farm roads,
and the purchase of livestock. The project would finance the development of
about:
(a) 400 cattle production farms in the Southwest;
(b) 200 cattle fattening farms in the Southwest;
(c) 150 sheep production farms in the Southwest;
(d) 450 dairy farms in the North;
(e) 350 cattle production farms in the North;
(f) 50 cattle fattening farms in the North;
(g) 100 milk sheep farms in marginal cereal zones (Southwest
and/or Central).



- 10 -
The farms would be owned and operated by private individuals, families or
communal organizations. The communally-owned farms are expected to be ia
categories (e) and (f) above.
Project Costs
30.       The total cost of the project would be $149.3 million.    On-farm
development costs total US$132.6 million (including working capital amounting
to $23.9 million). About 72 percent of the total would be invested in the
southwest, although this region would absorb only about 35 percent of the
Bank loan. Capital investment costs average US$350 per hectare but vary con-
siderably with the type of farm, costs for the smaller farms in the poorer
areas of the north being generally several times greater than those in the
southwest. The cost of operating LDA is estimated at about US$11.2 millicri,
including contingencies, and that of LPS, US$5.5 million. (Further details
of the project costs are given in Annex III).

/1   Short-term working capital.
32.       Continuing the lending arrangements in effect under the first loan,
project funds for relending and for the LDA would be placed in the separate
Special Project Fund in ICO. Farmers would borrow from the private savings
banks and BCA, which could then rediscount with the Fund up to 100 percent of
eligible medium-term sub-loans rmiade by them to farmers participating in the
project. The Fund would refinance at a rate that would leave the credit
agencies with a margin of at least 0.75 percent to cover their administrative
costs and risks. The refinancing rate would be 5.75 percent per annum,
which is approximately the blend rate between the Government's contribution
of $51.1 million equivalent to on-farm development at 4.08 percent and the
Bank rate of 8.5 percent. The credit agencies would finance the working

capital where required. Private bank participation is encouraged by the
legal requirement that they invest at least 13 percent of their resources in
agricultural loans. The government has undertaken to meet any shortfall in
project funds (Section 3.01(a)).
33.       Medium- and long-term agricultural credit in Spain has been tradi-
tionally extended by government institutions at subsidized rates varying from
2.75 percent to 7 percent; for livestock development programs, lending terms
to farmers for similar types of investment under the IRYDA and AC programs,
(paragraph 25) varied from 5 percent to 7 percent. In mid-1974 these rates
were raised to variable levels depending on the size of loans to individuals:
7 percent for loans up to 5 million pesetas and 7.5 percent for loans exceed-
ing 5 million pesetas. Communal organizations farming other than communal
land pay 0.5 percent less; while communal organization's farming communal
lands pay 6.5 percent on loans of any size; this lower rate is aimed at
encouraging the development of the communal lands, each bloc of which is owned
by a number of families. All these rates include an 0.5 percent technical
assistance fee on all loans which contributes to financing LDA's expenses,
supplementing funds from the Government and the proposed Bank loan. The
majority of borrowers in the north would pay the lower rates since, as
smaller farmers, they will be borrowing smaller amounts directly or through
their communal organizations. On-farm investment loans would have terms of
up to 12 years, including a three-year grace period.
34.       The element of subsidization in these rates is made possible by
Government subsidies for agricultural credit, and is justified as providing
incentives to overcome the lagging development of the agricultural sector.
Agricultural investment has increased over recent years, reaching an annual
level of US$750 million in 1972, but is still short of the amount needed to
raise incomes in the agricultural sector to the level of the industrial sec-
tor. While agricultural income has increased significantly over the last ten
years, it has been doing so at a slower rate than in manufacturing. The gov-
ernment is convinced that interest rate subsidies have contributed to raising
agricultural income. It should be noted, that the real rate paid by farmers
is close to 8 or 9 percent, including the 0.5 percent for LDA's administrative
costs, and 1 to 2 percent for the private bank guarantees used as collateral
by borrowers.
Project Implementation
35.       Arrangements for implementation of the first loan would in general
continue under the second loan (see paragraph 23). Livestock producers would
borrow from the participating credit agencies on the basis of farm plans
approved by LDA, which would provide the technical services for project
appraisal and supervision. It is the only institution in Spain which provides
a sound technical and financial approach to livestock production, and the only
one presently making it possible for producers to be provided with both long
term financing and technical assistance to undertake profitable meat and milk
production from pasture. At present all personnel of the LDA, apart from



the Director and two senior staff members, are employed on an annual couL-tact
basis. This situation has prevented the organization from offering adequate
prospects for career development to its staff and developing into an inst1iu-
tion with long-term stability.   The Bank has recommended that the LDA be ~,ven
a more permanent status and that at l1-st two-thirds of the personnel be erm-
ployed as members of the Civil Servxce (funcionarios del Instituto),    The
Ministry of Agriculture has made appropriate representations to the Ministr-y
of Finance and these changes in employee status are now being put into effecc.
In order to deal with the extension of the project area, the Government has
agreed to enlarge the staff, including hiring a consultant experienced in land
development and modern techniques of dairy and beef production from pasture,
as well as short term consultants for assignments relevant to the Project.
In addition the Ministry of Agriculture will employ a seed production
specialist to assist Spain in developing a pasture seed program. Following
continuing difficulties in the operation of the Livestock Procurement Service,
the Ministry of Agriculture adopted in October 1974, a new system for tro-
viding project farmers good quality breeding cattle.   Now farmers   al, choose
between acquiring (a) in-calf heifers which have been mated to sele zted rull'
or (b) female weaners less than one year old that the farmer mates to bulls
of his own choosing.   Under both plans the Ministry will be able t-j scp;vis-
the animals sold. A consicerable share of the Government's staff resour(-t-
will be focused. on the north; LDA already has five teams working there and
expects to set up three rnore.
36.       The extension of the second project to the north and the particular
problems to be faced there, require new initiatives by the Governmeirn. IQ41ile
lending to private farmers will continue, as in the southwest, special mea-
sures are being devised to bring the under-exploited, communally-on.r.ed hdds
into the project.  Development of these lands into livestock farms basec7 :n
improved pasture not only wtll increase production and income for t,L e    s,
but will also demonstrare t!e potential for local livestock product-in orv
a large area in the north.   Utilization arrangements for these lands naT rioc
yet been established, but under committees (Jurados) set up four years agc,
they are now beina surveyed and titles established.   Legally these lancb cou'd
be leased to individuals. The use of leases in such a situation would sti!-
raise practical problems however, and in practice such lands will be opv.iared
by communal organizations made up of the owners, such as grupos sind-      ies
de colonizacion or other types of livestock producers' organizarions. The.
Director of LDA has provided the Bank wich a statement of how thlese lands
would be utilized by these organizations and how LDA would work with theIr.
under the project.   A condition of effectiveness would be that at least ;_V-
blocks of communal larnd in tt,e northern project area would be selected :o
development under the Droject    These 'locks of land would be develo-,ed as
demonstration units and wouia be           lL the first year undet the ',ct.
Procurement
37.       As with agric-ultura.l. Lredtt operations generally, international.
conmpetitive bidding is not iappropriate for this project because the indilri.dual
contracts are small and nulierouz-, they could not be grouped since purchases



- 13 -
would be made over a 5-year period by individuals, and the size and mix ot
farm investments vary substantially between subprojects. The goods and serv-
ices required by farm development, both locally manufactured and imported,
would be procured through existing commercial channels which would also pro-
vide the service facilities. Most machinery, wire for fencing, and building
materials are manufactured locallv and are competitive with international
prices. An adequate number of international firms is represented to ensure
effective competition in the procurement of the required imported goods such
as seeds and certain types of machinery and equipment. Applicable import
duties on farm machinery are generally 25 percent or less while the import
duties on most pasture seeds are below 10 percent.
Disbursements and Auditing
38.       To ensure that Bank funds are channelled primarily into the lower
income area in the north, the Bank would reimburse against 60 percent of
expenditures incurred for eligible sub-loans in the north.    These are expect-
ed to amount to $28.1 million out of the total investment costs in that area
of $35.1 million (excluding working capital) and would absorb $19.5 million
of the proposed loan: this would include the unallocated amount of $2.7
million which would be reserved for the north and assure that the number of
farms to be developed in the north would not be diminished by cost increases.
In the southwest the Bank would reimburse against only 20 percent of expendi-
tures incurred for eligible sub-loans. These are expected to amount to $58.9
million out of total investment cost in this region of $73.6 million (again
excluding working capital), absorbing $11.7 million of the proposed Bank loan.
The loan would also finance 16 percent of the cost of LDA, which would amount
to $1.8 million.
Benefits
39.       The increases in farm family income that are expected to result from
the Project vary considerably between the north and southwest, and with the
type of farm. It is estimated that at full development, participating farmers'
annual income, after debt service but before income taxes, would increase from
2 to 14 fold in the southwest, and from 9 to 85 fold in the north.    After com-
pletion of farm development programs in the southwest some 300 farms are ex-
pected to reach annual incomes of about $16,500, 400 farms should have incomes
ranging from $22,200 to $33,300; and 150 farms (500 ha. dryland sheep farms)
incomes of about $43,30D. The income from many of these farms must be shared,
since they are owned by families with two or three sub-units, i.e. married
sons with thieir own families working with their fathers, brothers working
together, etc. Although the introduction of improved pasture and cattle pro-
duction shoLuld contribute substantially to raising income levels in the de-
pressed north, project income levels there are expected to remain lower than
in the southwest, even after full development.   Four hundred and fifty farms
are expected to have annual incomes of about $5,600; 350 with incomes of
$21,400 and 50 with incomes of $25,000. In this area fragmented farms are
expected to be consolidated, and several owners would share in the develop-
ment of one farm. The communal lands will be operated by groups and the
farms' increased revenue will therefore accrue to a number of owners.

the program gained momentum and by the end of 1974 all the loan proceeds were
expected to be committed. Due to the slow start, however, and the fact that
on-farm investments are phased over a period of two to three years, disburse-
ments from the Loan were not completed by the original closing date of Decem-
ber 1, 1974. Consequently, the closing date was postponed until December 1,
1975. The Agency responsible for execution is now well established and it has
built up an experienced staff capable of expanding its operations. The con-
cept of the program has found firm acceptance in the regions of its initial
operations, and will continue there as well as in new areas under the proposed
second loan.
Ln. No. 699 - First Education; US$12.0 million Loan of June 30, 1970; Closing
date: June 30_, 1974
Execution of this loan is nearly four years behind schedule due to
delays in establishing the Project Unit, frequent personnel changes at high
levels within the Ministry of Education with the subsequent effects on educa-
tional policy. This has delayed execution of the project, and, in the mean-
time, construction costs have risen drastically. Recently there has been a
shift in government policy away from immediate implementation of the 1970
reform program and towards building the maximum number of schools to satisfy
the growing public demand for more places in primary and secondary schools.
Although the Government's education budget for 1974 is higher than ever
before, the Government does not intend to adhere to the standard of student
accommodations envisaged in the project, including the resources devoted to
pre-technical training, which in the Bank's judgment are a key element in the
educational reform. Consequently the Bank has not accepted the revisions in
the loan agreement requested by the Government, which has requested cancel-
lation. The Bank accordingly cancelled this loan on March 25, 1975.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any pro-
blems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read In this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 768 - Agricultural Research; US$12.7 million Loan of June 28. 1971
Closing date: June 30, 1976
While foreign research experts were employed and a fellowship
training program commenced, changes in the leadership of the executing agency
and its internal reorganization delayed obtaining adequate investment plans
for some of the research programs, and as a result sufficient financing to
cover costs of supporting staff, locally procured supplies, etc. A new
president was appointed in April 1974, who has obtained an adequate budget
for the rest of 1974 as well as additional funds for local staff supporting
foreign experts working in the project. The Instituto Nacional de Investiga-
cion (INIA), the Government's agricultural research agency, is seeking supple-
mental funds for 1975 to cover its expanded operations. By the end of 1974
it had acquired and commenced development of suitable farms on which to carry
out its research programs for several of the research centers to be developed
under the project, and plans for the others were progressing satisfactorily.
Because of the delays incurred earlier, we expect the closing date to be post-
poned.
Ln. No. 772 - Third Railways; US$90.0 million Loan of June 30, 1971;
Closing date: October 31, 1975
The original closing date of June 30, 1974 was extended to October
31, 1975 to accommodate late deliveries of rails. The execution of the proj-
ect as a whole is satisfactory.
Ln. No. 832 - Second Education; US$50.0 million Loan of June 21, 1972;
Closing date: June 30, 1977
The difficulties impeding execution of the First Education project
have similarly affected this project. A major element was assistance to the
Polytechnic University of Barcelona in building facilities on a new campus,
which the Covernment has now abandoned. Under these conditions the curriculum
reforms in scientific and engineering education supported by the Bank through
this loan are not expected to be achieved. The Bank has not accepted the
revisions to the loan proposed by the Government, which has requested cancel-
lation. The Bank accordingly cancelled this loan on March 25, 1975.
Ln. No. 884 - Second Ports; US$50 million Loan of March 27, 1973;
Closing date: June 30, 1978
This loan became effective on August 13, 1973. Contractors for
most civil works have been pre-qualified, and tenders have been received and
now are being analyzed. Contracts have been awarded for 58 quay cranes.
Most of the civil works and all cranes have been contracted for. There are
no major problems in this project.

SPAIN: SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                 Spain
Beneficiaries:            5,100 farm families to whom loan proceeds will
be on-lent through financial intermediaries.
Amount:                   US$33 million equivalent in various currencies.
The proposed loan would finance the project's
estimated foreign exchange component.
Terms:                    Amortization in 15 years, including a 5 year
grace period, with interest at 8 1/2 percent.
Relending Terms:          Project funds from the Bank and Treasury would
be channeled to farmers by using the Instituto
de Credito Oficial (ICO) for a rediscount opera-
tion to the Banco de Credito Agricola (BCA)
and private lending institutions. On-farm invest-
ment loans would be extended to farmers for a
term of up to 12 years, including up to three
years grace period, at a total per annum charge
of 7 percent for loans up to 5 million Ptas,
and 7.5 percent for loans exceeding 5 million Ptas.
Communal organizations farming other than com-
munal lands would pay 0.5 percent less than private
farmers on such lands; communal organizations
farming communal lands would pay 6.5 percent on
loans of any size. All of these charges include
a 0.5 percent technical assistance fee.
Project Description:      The project would continue the program and expand
the area of operations of the first-Bank assisted
livestock development project in Spain, financed
under Loan 633-SP. It would extend the application
of major changes in livestock production techniques
aimed at increasing the carrying capacity of the
land and the productivity of the breeding herds to
help meet Spain's increasing demand for meat. A
primary objective would be to resolve problems of
farm structure and land tenure presently limiting
farm modernization and production in the north
of Spain. The project would finance the develop-
ment of about:

Procurement
Arrangements:           International competitive bidding is not appropriate
for this Project because the individual contracts are
small and numerous, they could not be grouped since
purchases would be made over a 5-year period, and
the size and mix of farm investments vary substantial-
ly between subprojects and cannot be predetermined.
The goods and services required for farm developmenrit
both locally manufactured and imported, would be
procured through existing commercial channels which
would also provide the service facilities. Most
machinery, wire for fencing, and building materials
are manufactured locally and are competitive with
international prices. An adequate number of inter-
national firms is represented to ensure effective
competition in the procurement of the required im-
ported goods such as seeds and certain types of
machinery and equipment. Applicable import duties
on farm machinery are generally 25 percent or less
while the import duties on most pasture seeds are
below 10 percent.
Consultants:              Would be employed for technical assistance and
staff training.
Economic Rate of
Return:                 Estimated at 16 percent.
