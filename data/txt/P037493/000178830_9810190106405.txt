PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SPAIN SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1141-SP)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Second Livestock
Development Project in Spain for which, Loan 1141-SP was approved in May 1975
in the sum of US$33.0 million and closed, fully disbursed, in March 1982.
This PCR was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Regional Office following a two week visit to Spain by two staff members and
is based on reviews of the Appraisal Report (No. 544b-SP), dated February 28,
1975; the President's Report (No. P-1559a-SP), dated April 3, 1975; the Loan
Agreement, dated July 16, 1975; the accummulated supervision reports and
correspondence on Bank Group files; and the yearbooks and draft completion
report prepared by the Livestock Development Agency (LDA). Bank staff and
Government officials associated with the project were also interviewed and
their valuable assistance iLs greatfully acknowledged.
This PCR compares actual developments with appraisal proposals and
highlights the principal achievements, issues, and lessons learnt.
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on August 18, 1983, for
comments by October 13, 1933. Comments received are appended in the attached
Annex.
This project has not been subjected to an audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SPAIN SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1141-SP)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The Project was a follow-up on a First Livestock Development Project
for which the Bank grantEd Spain a W25.0 million loan (Loan 633-SP) in 1969.
This first project was ar, initial step of an expected long-term livestock
development program aimec. at introducing major changes in production
techniques and policies to help meet a rapidly increasing demand for meat and
milk. The Project Performance Audit Report No. 1706, dated August 23, 1977,
deemed the first project successful. Most appraisal expectations were
broadly met particularly the establishment of:
(a) a strong Livestock Development Agency with well trained
technicians; and
(b)  a modern credit system for the development of livestock farms
providing long-term loans, sound planning services and
continuous technical supervision for the benefit of farmers and
lending institution (paras. 1.10 and 1.11).
2.       The Second Livestock Development Project, was supported by Loan
1141-SP of July 16, 1975 for $33 million. This project was aimed at
increasing meat and milk production through the development of 1,000 beef
farms, 450 dairy farms and 250 sheep farms in different parts of the country
of which 400 were to be on communally owned grazing land in the Galicia
Region (para. 2.13). The Project was also aimed at strengthening the
technical capabilities oE LDA; establishing of a Livestock Procurement
Service to assist farmers in buying breeding cattle; and developing of a
pasture seed production Jrogram to reduce imports from abroad.
3.       The Loan was three months late in starting and 18 months late in
closing. The former was due to delays in ratifying the Project by
publication in the official gazette and the latter was to allow for the
completion of disbursements by the Bank on incurred expenditures and
outstanding commitments (para. 2.17 and 3.01). Bank disbursements from the
Loan were slow in starting because farm development had to be postponed by a
year following the three month delay in Loan Effectiveness and slow in
building up mainly because onlending banks were slow in rediscounting their
farm development loans with ICO and to a lesser extent because LDA had phased
the Credit Program over a period of seven years and not five as indicated by
appraisal (para. 3.23).

4.       The Project succeeded in financing the development of 1,589
livestock farms of which 862 were in the low-rainfall Southwest Project Area
and 727 were in the high-rainfall Northern Project Area (paras. 3.02 and
3.03). The costs of farm development amounted to Ptas 11,172 million ($151.5
million) and the loans granted to Ptas 8,727 million ($118.3 million)
compared with appraisal estimates of Ptas 6,303 million and Ptas 5,042
million ($132.6 million and $106.1 million) respectively. These loans
financed less than half the number of beef farms (485), more than twice the
number of sheep farms (589) and about the same number of dairy farms (515)
projected by appraisal (para. 3.06). Production increases are estimated at
about 75%-100% per ha on beef farms and 100%-125% per ha on sheep farms in
the Southwest Project Area and 150%-175% on dairy farms in the Northern
Project Area (para. 4.03).
5.       The LDA grew into a bigger, stronger and more effective technical
organization with clearly defined responsibilities over the livestock
development programs of the country and with a secure future in the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (para. 4.05). The LDA also succeeded in
spreading modern livestock development technology throughout Spain and in
concluding agreements of technical cooperation with the banking sector and
with provincial governments for continued support in developing the livestock
industry of the country (para. 4.06).
6.       Despite concerted efforts by LDA the Project failed to initiate
development of montes vecinales (municipally owned grazing lands) in the
Galicia Region because the Land Reform Law of 1973, on which the program was
based, did not change the ownership but only legalized the lease of such land
with the result that bankers were still unwilling to extend credit and
farmers were still refusing to borrow money and/or post personal property as
collateral for the purpose (paras. 3.09 and 6.07). On the other hand the
Project improved the utilization of montes communales (collectively owned
grazing lands) on 86 farms in other parts of northern Spain (paras. 3.10 and
6.06). This was done indirectly by granting development loans to farmers who
owned nearby farms or held long-term leases to such land from the municipal
boards concerned. These loans were, however, mainly used to develop the home
farms and were usually secured conventially by personal collateral or
guarantees.
7.       The LDA technicians assisted farmers in purchasing a total of some
90,000 breeding cattle, 20,000 fattening steers and 511,000 sheep and goats
for their farms (para. 3.08). The Ministry of Agriculture did not establish
a Livestock Procurement Service which was meant to ensure that sufficient
numbers of breeding cattle were available but instead achieved the same end
result with less direct involvement by subsidizing the acquisition of young
calves (para. 3.20). The Project also had little impact on of pasture seed
production in the country (para. 3.18).



-v
8.       The Project also showed that;
(a) sheep and goat farms are more profitable than beef farms in the
dryer parts of the country (para. 6.03);
(b) beef breeding farms in the dry parts of Spain have become
financially unprofitable if they require transformation from an
undeveloped to a developed state by heavy capital investments
during the first two or three years. Instead, smaller
investments in partially developed farms on items known to
generate the greatest benefits were demonstrated to be the best
means of minimizing costs and maximizing returns (para. 2.02);
and
(c) development of communal grazing land is unlikely under
prevailing laws and farmer attitudes concerning the ownership
and administration of such land (paras. 6.06 and 6.07).
9.       The completed project was estimated to cost US$167.8 million and to
have a 14% economic rate of return compared with US$149.3 million and 16%
respectively calculated at appraisal.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SPAIN SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN L141-SP)
I. BACKGROUND
Geography and Weather
1.01     Spain lies between latitudes 36° and 440 north and totals some
504,700 km 2 in area. ALmost half of this area is high plateau averaging
around 700 m in altitude. There are three major climatological zones in the
country, namely:
(a)  the southern and eastern coastal areas with typically
Mediterranean type weather characterized by hot dry summers and
mild wet winters;
(b)  the central plateau with continental type weather characterized
by hot dry summers and cold wet winters; and
(c) the northern coastal area with maritime weather characterized by
moderate frost-free temperatures and year round precipitation.
Rainfall along the Mediterranean coastal areas and on the central plateau
totals only about 350-650 mm annually and, besides being concentrated during
the colder winter months of the year, is patchy, unreliable and subject to
considerable variation from one year to another. On the other hand, rainfall
in the northern temperate coastal area totals about 800-1400 mm and is better
distributed, less patchy and more reliable. In the absence of irrigation, the
southern, eastern and cenitral parts of the country are agriculturally better
suited for the establishment of extensive livestock breeding operations and
the northern parts of the country for the production of milk, beef, lamb and
wool predominantly from improved temperate pastures as is the case in New
Zealand and Ireland.
National Economy
1.02     Spain's population grew at an annual rate of 1.1% during the 1970s
and totalled about 38 miLlion in 1981. The economy recorded an annual growth
rate of 3X in GNP per capita during the same period, reaching a per capita
equivalent of USt5,350 in 1981.
Agricultural Sector
1.03     The contributions of the agricultural sector to the national economy
declined between 1970 and 1981 from about 11.3% of GDP to around 6.3% of GDP.
The notable changes accompanying this decline were.



- 2 -
(a) a reduction in the agricultural labor force both in absolute and
relative terms from about 3.6 million to 2.1 million farm
workers and from around 28% to 16% of the total labor force
caused mainly by the migration of labor from agriculture to
industry and the abandonment of small farms;
(b) a decrease in the relative importance of agricultural exports
from 28% to 22% of total exports;
(c) a parallel decrease in the relative importance of agricultural
imports from 22% to 14% of total imports; and
(d) an increase in agricultural labor productivity averaging about
6.5% annually between 1970 and 1981.
Livestock Subsector
1.04     In 1973, livestock accounted for about 39% of agricultural output
with meat and milk production totalling 1.5 million tons and 5.3 million
liters, respectively. Pork provided the largest volume of meat (587,000 tons)
followed by beef and veal (373,000 tons), poultry (344,000 tons) and sheep
(130,000 tons).
1.05     Livestock production between 1960 and 1973 increased three times more
rapidly than crop production. During this period beef and veal production
rose by about 7% annually; pork by about 6.5% and lamb and mutton by less than
1%. These increases, however, were insufficient to meet the rising demand for
livestock products generated by better incomes (average of about 5.8%
annually) and an expanding tourist industry. As a result meat and feed grain
imports grew rapidly during the first half of this period from about 10,000
tons and 1.6 million ton, respectively in 1961, to around 120,000 tons and 3.5
millions tons respectively in 1966. These import levels, however, remained
more or less unchanged from then until 1973 and the rising demand for meat
during this period was in the main met by increased domestic production which
then totalled about 1.5 million tons annually. The demand for meat was at
that time also projected to continue rising from about 1.6 million tons in
1973 to around 1.8 million tons in 1975 and 2.2 million tons in 1980,
representing 20% and 50% increases over the 1973 level of production.
1.06     Early slaughter of young cattle was characteristic of the Spanish
beef industry in the early 1960s. Nearly 60% of the slaughtered cattle were
then killed as calves and sold as veal compared with about 36% in EEC
countries and 10% in the UK and USA. Measures taken by Government to
counteract this consumer preference for veal, which in effect stifled the
productivity and expansion of the national herd, included regulations
progressively raising the minimum slaughter weight of calves and price
incentives for animals slaughtered above prescribed weights. These measures
were responsible for raising the minimum cold dressed weight (CDW) of calves
to 125 kg by 1973 and the average CDW of cattle slaughtered from 167 kg in
1968 to 210 kg in 1972, representing an increase of about 70,000 tons of beef
worth the equivalent of around US$100 million.



-3-
Livestock Development PoLicy
1.07     In the face of l:he rapidly rising demand for meat, Government's
livestock development poliicy in the late 1960s and early 1970s was in the main
directed at increasing domestic production of livestock products and at
minimizing imports of beef and feed grains because they were becoming
progressively more expens;ive on world markets. Within this broad policy,
primary emphasis was to be laid on the production of beef through the
development of pastoral resources, particularly in the temperate northern
region of the country whiLch, from an ecological point of view, was considered
best suited for the purpose.
1.08     The measures that had already been taken by Government to encourage
investment by the private sector in the livestock industry included:
(a)  medium- and long-term institutional credit on terms considerably
more attractive than those provided by commercial banks --
5.0-7.0% in 1973 compared to ongoing commercial rates of
8.0-12.0%;
(b) minimum price guarantees on slaughter cattle paid by the
Procurement: and Transportation Board (CAT) on behalf of the Fund
for the Regulation and Management of Agricultural Prices and
Production (FORPPA);
(c)  price incentives on cattle slaughtered above prescribed CDWs;
(d)  subsidies on certain farm inputs - up to 20% on seed and
fertilizer costs for pasture development; and
(e) services irk the fields of farm planning and extension by the LDA
and the Agricultural Extension Service (AES), animal health by
the General Directorate of Agricultural Production (GDAP),
research bv the National Institute for Agricultural Research
(INIA) and training by 13 schools and three agricultural plus
four veter:inary university faculties.
In addition, Government passed a Land Reform Law in mid-1973 which was
primarily aimed at expedi ting the development of communal land. The law
essentially continued to prohibit the sale and mortgage of communal land, but
subject to consent by a majority of users, authorized the lease of such land
to private or public entities for periods not exceeding 12 years.   The four
provinces of Galicia in Nlorthern Spain were expected to reap large benefits
from this law because they were then estimated to have some 2.0 to 2.5 million
ha of communally-owned grazing land which, although ideally suited for
intensive pasture development, lay underutilized and covered with gorse and
scrub. This law was at the time considered a major breakthrough in land
reform but, from a practical point of view, was still new and untested when
the Second Livestock Project was appraised in early 1974. The two other
constraints prevailing at. that time were:



-4 -
(a) the shortage of information on the willingness of farmers to
borrow money and of credit organizations to lend money for
long-term development of what essentially was still communal
land; and
(b) the lack of guidelines and procedures to channel funds toward
such development.
Ongoing Livestock Credit Programs
1.09     Government had three main livestock credit programs in operation
prior to appraisal, namely:
(a) the Agricultural Reform and Development Institute (IRYDA)
program, started in 1971 and extending up to Ptas 2.5 million in
credit to individual farmers and up to Ptas 15.0 million to
agricultural associations for the development of livestock
enterprises meeting Ministry of Agriculture criteria;
(b) the Accion Concertada (AC) program, started in 1964, and
extending credit mainly for feedlot fattening of cattle to
produce animals weighing at least 350 kg at 20 months of age;
and
(c) the Livestock Development Agency (LDA) program, started in 1970
under the Bank financed First Livestock Development Project,
Loan 633-SP, to provide long-term credit and technical services
for the development of livestock farms and the improvement of
pastures.
1.10     The LDA program was the only one providing credit to farmers on the
basis of technically feasible and financially viable farm development plans
prepared and implemented under the supervision of qualified staff. This
project, although centered in the dry southwestern region of Spain and based
mainly on the development of subterranean clover pastures for the production
of beef, also included a pilot dairy farm development component in the wetter
northern provinces of the country based primarily on temperate legume and
grass pastures. A total of 577 farms were developed under the project in the
south at an average unit cost of US$ 67,000 and 126 in the north at an average
cost of US$ 16,000 each.l/
1.11     Medium- and long-term credit for the three programs described above
was channeled by Government to the farming community through the Official
Credit Institute (ICO), rediscounting of loans from the official Agricultural
1/ See also Project Performance Audit Report--Spain First Livestock
Development Project (Loan 633-SP), OED Report No. 1706 dated August 23, 1977.

Credit Bank and from the commercial banks. Short-term financing to meet
operating costs was provided entirely by the commercial banking sector.
II.  PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Identification and Preparation
2.01     The Second Livestock Project was identified and prepared by the
technical staff of the Livestock Development Agency (LDA) during the first
half of 1973 with assistance from Bank missions supervising the First
Project.  The project was then meant to:
(a) expand livestock development activities initiated under the
First Project in northern and southwestern Spain in general and
on communally-owned grazing land of the Galicia Region in
particular;
(b)  increase meat production and to a lesser extent milk production;
and
(c) strengthen LDAs technical capabilities.
B. Appraisal
2.02     The preparation report was forwarded to the Bank by the General
Director of the LDA in early November 1973, and the Project was appraised in
February/March 1974. The mission started off by supervising the First
Livestock Project, and, after concluding that achievement had exceeded
expectations, went on to recommend a second livestock project costing about
US$130 million, having a foreign exchange component of some US$28 million
(20%), warranting a Bank loan of around US$28-30 million, and consisting of
four components, namely:
(a)  developing 1800 farms in different parts of the country;
(b) strengthening LDA;
(c) establishing a pasture seed production and marketing program;
and
(d) operating a livestock procurement service.
2.03     The mission's issues paper indicated that the project would have a
"major thrust" in developing communally-owned pastoral land in northern Spain,
particularly in the four agriculturally depressed provinces of Galicia. It
then went on to identify three key issues, namely: communal ownership of
pastoral land in northern Spain; low and variable interest rates on livestock
credit; and deficiencies in LDA staffing. These issues were discussed with
Spanish authorities initially during appraisal and subsequently during two



appraisal follow-up missions in May/June and November/December 1974. They are
described in greater detail in the following paragraphs.
C. Issues
2.04     Communal Ownership of Pastoral Land in Northern Spain.    The appraisal
mission estimated that the area of communal grazing land suited for
development into high-producing permanent temperate pastures totalled some 1.2
million ha in the Galicia Region and around 2.0-2.5 million ha in all of
northern Spain and went on to indicate that most of these areas were then
covered with gorse and scrub. Communally-owned lands in northern Spain had
for centuries belonged either to local municipalgovernments (Bienes Propios),
or to local village farming communities (Bienes Communales), and had, in the
main, remained largely undeveloped and underutilized because they were not
subject to sale or mortgage under prevailing laws.
2.05     The Government of Spain had for long recognized the productive
potential of these communal lands and had issued a series of decrees
regulating their use culminating in a Land Reform Law which came into effect
in 1973. This law continued the ban on the sale and mortgage of communal
lands but, subject to consent by a majority of the users concerned, authorized
the lease of such lands under the auspices of the Minister of Agriculture,
thereby theoretically opening them up for development. The appraisal mission
came on the scene soon after and attempted to expedite the preparation of
guidelines and procedures for leasing and financing communal land development
by recommending that provincial committees be established under the
Chairmanship of the Provincial Delegate of the Minister of Agriculture in each
of the four provinces of Galicia and that each of these committees be charged
with two specific responsibilities, namely:
(a)  locating at least five blocks of communally-owned pastures
suitable for low-cost pastoral development and beef production,
each totalling about 100 ha; and
(b)  investigating the feasibility of leasing these blocks to
provincial savings banks or to a comparable agency for
development by the technical staff of LDA and subsequent
settlement by selected farmers in the community.
These recommendations were subsequently further firmed up in the Bank to the
point where.
(a) Board presentation of the project was made contingent on
the receipt of a written statement from the General
Director of the LDA detailing how communal land was to be
leased and developed under the Project (received late
February 1975); and
(b) loan effectiveness was made contingent on the selection by
LDA of at least five blocks of communal land in the
Northern Project Area suitable for development during the
first year of the Project.



2.06     Interest Rates on Livestock Credit.   The 1973 preparation report
proposed that farmers pay 6.5% interest on long-term livestock development
loans plus 0.5% for the technical services of the LDA, i.e., a total of 7%.
At that time Spanish banks were charging 9-12% on livestock development loans
and 7.5-8.0% on short-tern agricultural loans without providing any technical
services while the Bank's own lending rate to member countries was 7.25%. At
the same time, interest on Government livestock development funds channelled
through the Agricultural Reform and Development Institute (IRYDA) and Accion
Concertada (AC), both of the Ministry of Agriculture, ranged from 5.5% to
6.5%, i.e., 0.5% to 1.5% lower than the 7% interest paid by farmers under the
ongoing First and proposed Second Livestock Projects.
2.07     Bank concern over the low interest rates being charged on official
livestock development credit was brought to the attention of Spanish
authorities before, during and on several occasions following appraisal,
including negotiations. The authorities were urged on each of these
occasions, first to increase the cost of livestock development funds under the
Second Project closer to prevailing commercial interest rates so as to attract
the private banking sector into the Project; and, second, to decrease the
differences in interest rates charged on official livestock development funds
being channelled by Government through IRYDA, AC and LDA (para 1.09) to avoid
unfair competition among the three organizations. Although Spanish
authorities agreed during negotiations to refrain from offering more favorable
lending terms to farmers in the Project Area through other official livestock
development agencies, they made virtuaLly no concessions with regard to
bringing these interest rates more in Line with those for commercial bank
loans. They only agreed to lower rates to communal organizations and for
communal land development to encourage the development of such land. Interest
rates were, however, raised on February 1, 1979, while the Project was being
implemented to 9.5% for cooperatives and 10% for individual farmers compared
to prevailing commercial lending rates of 12-15%.
2.08     LDA Staffing.   The LDA was established in 1969 by Government decree
as a semi-autonomous technical organization within the Ministry of Agriculture
to:
(a)  assist livestock farmers and financing organizations in the
preparation of technically feasible and financially viable farm
development plans;
(b)  assist sub-borrowers in the development and management of their
farms; and
(c)  supervise the sub-borrowers' performance on behalf of the
financing organization concerned.
The LDA had grown to a complement of about 100 technicians and support staff
by early 1974, but only tiae Director and three senior staff members were
permanent civil servants. All the rest were employed on annual contracts
without job security, career prospects or retirement benefits. Many were



- 8 -
unhappy and some had either left LDA or had sought secondary employment
elsewhere because their salaries had not kept up with the cost of living as
had those of other Ministry of Agriculture employees. The appraisal mission
concluded that these working conditions were undermining morale and were
raising serious problems in recruiting and retaining qualified and experienced
staff. Having reached these conclusions, the mission then urged Spanish
authorities to consider placing at least two-thirds of LDA staff on permanent
civil service contracts. Government's acceptance of this recommendation was
officially communicated to the Bank in October 1974 by the General Director of
the LDA who wrote that he had been authorized to fill 68 "permanent" positions
on his staff, and because of this commitment, the matter was not discussed any
further during negotiations or mentioned in the Loan Agreement.
2.09     "Major Thrust" of the Project.   On return to the Bank, and
subsequently at the Issues Meeting, the appraisal mission indicated that the
"major thrust" of the Project should be in the north, particularly in the four
provinces of Galicia, while continuing to expand operations in the southwest
thereby implying that more funds and greater efforts would be expended on the
development of small livestock farms and communal grazing areas in the north
than on large cattle and sheep farms in the southwest (para. 2.04). However,
the first two drafts of the appraisal report called for the development of 850
livestock properties in each of the two project areas and involved the
improvement of ten times as much land and the expenditure of twice as much
money in the Southwest as in the North, namely: a total land area of about
290,000 ha and a total development cost per area of US$74.0 million in the
Southwest, compared with 23,000 ha and US035.0 million in the North.
2.10     The above proposals were initially reviewed in the Bank in late
August 1974 and subsequently in late October 1974 and on both occasions
concern was expressed over the Bank's involvement in the Southwest, mainly
because the Project there seemed directed more at the development of what
appeared to be large cattle and sheep ranches than at the development of small
livestock farms as was the case in the north. These reviews eventuated,
however, in acceptance of the appraisal mission's farm development program
with the proviso that Bank financing of farm development loans should be at a
lower level in the Southwest Project Area than in the Northern Project Area
and not at a uniform 40% as proposed in the first draft appraisal report.
After consultation with Spanish authorities agreement was reached that the
Bank would finance 60% of each farm development loan in the Northern Project
Area and 20% in the Southwest Project Area.
D. Negotiations
2.11     Negotiations were initially scheduled for mid-September 1974, but
were postponed three times by the Bank because of the issues described above
and finally took place in early February 1975. These were completed by telex
on April 7, 1975 following review of the Loan Agreement by Spanish Authorities
and Bank Management.



-9-
E. The Project as Approv ed
2.12     The Second Livestock Project was aimed at:
(a) increasing meat and milk production in the face of rising
domestic demand and external price levels;
(b) introducing institutional changes in land tenure to improve the
utilization of communally-owned pastoral resources in the
Galicia Region of northern Spain; and
(c) reinforcing technological innovations begun under the First
Project to consolidate the position of LDA as a technical
development agency.
2.13     The Project consisted of three components, namely;
(a)  Credit Program.   Development of 1,700 farms by financing
establishment and renovation of pastures; construction of farm
buildings, fences, roads and water facilities; and purchase of
livestock and machinery. Half of the farms would be in the
Southwest and the other half in the Northern Project Area; of
the latter 400 farms were expected to be communally owned.
(b) Technical Services. Provision of extension and animal health
services by LDA to assist farmers in planning, developing,
operating and managing thieir farms and to protect their animals
from disease. This component also included funds for training
LDA technicians within Spain and abroad.
(c)  Livestock Procurement Service.     Purchase of livestock for
Project farmers under the technical supervision of the Ministry
of Agriculture with assistance from LDA.
2.14     The Project was estimated to cost a total of Ptas 8,651 million
(US$149.3 million), have a 16% economic rate of return, benefit about 5,100
farm families, generate an incremental 35,000 tons of beef, 10,000 tons of
lamb and mutton, 800 tons of wool and 20,000 tons of milk at full development,
and warrant a Bank Loan of US$33.0 million. The financial rates of return for
the various farm models ranged from 12--13% for dryland beef farms and 24-27%
on sheep producing farms in the Southwest Project Area to 39% and 100% on and
dairy and beef fattening Earms in the Northern Project Area.
2.15     The Project was to be jointly financed by farmers, credit agencies,
Government and the Bank a, the following respective percentages: 19%, 16%,
43% and 22%. Funds for farm development were to be channelled by Treasury,
first through the Official Credit Institute (ICO) and then through the
Agricultural Credit Bank (BCA) and commercial lending institutions utilizing a
rediscount operation. Loans to farmers were to be for periods of up to 12
years inclusive of a 3-year grace period at an annual interest rate of 7.0%



- 10 -
for loans to individuals and 6.5% to communal organizations. All of these
charges included a 0.5% technical assistance fee to LDA. The US$33.0 million
Bank Loan to Government was for a term of 15 years, which included a 5-year
period of grace and bore an interest rate of 8.5%.
F. Board Presentation
2.16     The Loan was approved by the Bank's Board of Executive Directors on
April 15, 1975.   The presentation theme was "Government's Program for the
Development for Pasture of Underutilized Land in Northwestern Spain". In the
discussion that followed, concern was expressed over the income distribution
effects of the Project; the danger of stimulating inefficient production of
livestock products through subsidized interest rates and the rationale of
financing meat and milk production in a country to replace cheaper imports.
In reply it was pointed out that the greater portion of the Loan was earmarked
for small farm development in the heavily populated northwestern part of the
country and that interest rates on other official lines of livestock
development credit had, on Bank recommendations, been raised by Government to
Project levels (para. 2.06). The Loan was signed on July 16, 1975.
G. Loan Effectiveness
2.17     Loan effectiveness was initially scheduled for October 15, 1975 but
was postponed twice to December 15, 1975, due to delays in publication of the
Loan Agreement in the Spanish Official Gazette.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Costs and Benefits
3.01     Project implementation started in January 1976 and ended in March
1982. In March 1980, the LDA stopped accepting new applications for farm
development loans. During this period, the Loan Agreement was amended four
times namely:
(a)  in January 1978 to add three provinces (one in the North and two
in the Southwest) to the Project area;
(b)  in August 1978 to add three more provinces (two in the North and
one in the Southwest) to the Project area;
(c)  in September 1980 to postpone the Closing Date of the Loan from
October 1, 1980, to March 31, 1982, and to reallocate USt2.7
million from Category 3, (Unallocated), to Category lB
(Southwest Project Area); and
(d)  in November 1980 to reallocate US$1.1 million from Category 1A,
(Northern Project Area) to Category lB (Southwest Project Area)
and to increase the level of Bank financing of Category 1B



- 11 -
expenditures from 20% to 60% of amounts disbursed by ICO for the
Project--the former because demand for credit in the Northern
Project area did not materialize to the extent envisaged by
appraisal and the latter because of marked post-appraisal
increases in the direct and indirect foreign exchange costs of
farm development.
The project was estimatec. to cost US$167.8 million and to have a 14% economic
rate of return compared with US$149.3 million and 16%, respectively estimated
at appraisal.
B. The Credit Program
3.02     Appraisal Projections.    The credit program outlined by the appraisal
mission was based on the development of 850 livestock farms in each of the two
project areas (Table 1). The capital development costs of the program were
estimated to total Ptas 0,303 million (US$108.7 million) and to average about
Ptas 5.0 million (US$86,200) per farm in the Southwest Project Area, and Ptas
2.4 million (USt4l,400) per farm in the Northern Project Area. Long-term
credit requirements were estimated at 80% of total costs. Nearly two-thirds
of the long-term development loans were earmarked for the Southwest Project
Area and the remainder for the Northern Project Area.
3.03     LDA Achievement;.   The Project financed the development of 1,589
livestock farms, 862 in the Southwest Project Area and 727 in the Northern
Project Area, i.e. 101% and 85% of appraisal projections, respectively (Table
2). The capital development costs and the long-term loans provided by the
program totalled Ptas 11,172 million and Ptas 8,727.0 million, thereby
exceeding appraisal estimates by about 70% at current prices.     In the
Southwest Project Area capital development costs and long-term loans were
about 90% and 85% higher than appraisal forecasts. Capital development costs
and long-term loans in the Northern Project Area on the other hand, were only
about 45% higher than appraisal estimates (Table 3).
3.04     Processing of Loan Applications.    A total of 2,985 loan applications
were received in the Southern Project Area and 3,223 in the Northern Project
Area (Table 4).   During the first two years, 18% of the applications
culminated in loans in Southwest Project Area and 14% in the Northern Project
Area. These ratios of loans to applic:ations more than doubled in the second
two-year period to 43% and 31% respectively, with the result that twice as
many loans were granted -luring the latter period than the former. The overall
loan/application ratio was one in three in the Southwest and one in five in
Northern Project Areas.
3.05     Onlending Banks.   Savings banks accounted for about 41% of the loans
granted and 46% of the funds lent (Table 5). The Agricultural Credit Bank
(BCA) came next (24% and 22%, respectively) and was followed by rural banks
(22% and 16%, respectively) and private banks (13% and 16%, respectively).
Savings banks were generally more active in the Southwest Project Area than in
the Northern Project Area while the opposite was the case with rural banks.
About 45% of the number of loans granted and 56% of the funds lent were
guaranteed by mortgage of property (Table 5). Personal guarantees were used



- 12 -
to secure another 31% of the number of loans and 23% of the funds lent. The
remainder were secured by bank and/or Communal Guarantee Agency (ASICA)
endorsements. Loans were in the main secured by mortgage of property in the
Southwest Project Area (about 60%) and by mortgage of property and/or personal
guarantees in the Northern Project Area (around 35% each). Generally there
was greater use of personal guarantees during the last two years of project
implementation than in the first two, particularly in the Northern Project
Area.  Endorsements by ASICA were also more common in the Northern Project
Area than in the Southwest Project Area (Table 6), reflecting the relatively
lower levels of farmer affluence in the North.
3.06     Types and Sizes of Farms.   The Bank loan financed the development of
a greater number of dairy and sheep farms and a smaller number of beef farms
than was projected at appraisal; namely: 515 dairy farms instead of 450; 589
sheep farms instead of 250 and 485 beef farms instead of 1,000 (Table 7).
Most of the dairy farms were in the Northern Project Area (497) and close to
80% of the beef farms and sheep farms were in the Southwest Project Area. (377
and 467). There was less beef development in the Northern Project Area than
was estimated at appraisal (108 farms instead of 400) and there was greater
emphasis in the Southwest Project Area on cattle and sheep breeding (670
farms) than on cattle fattening (58 farms) or milking sheep (65 farms) (paras
6.02 - 6.04).
3.07     Dairy farms in the Northern Project Area varied greatly in size and
were generally larger than the 6-ha dairy model presented in the appraisal
report, averaging about 20 ha in the Galicia Region and around 12 ha further
east in the Cantabrico Region. Beef farms in this project area ranged from 30
ha to more than 600 ha with most being well in excess of the 50-ha appraisal
model. On the other hand sub-borrowers farm sizes in the Southwest Project
Area tended to be closer to appraisal estimates with the smaller and more
intensive livestock farms having some land under irrigation and ranging from 5
ha to 200 ha, and with the larger nonirrigated farms ranging from around 200
ha to well over 500 ha.
3.08     Farm Development Inputs.   The Bank loan financed the purchase of
89,250 breeding cattle, 19,927 fattening steers and 510,799 sheep and goats.
It also financed the development of 1,589 farms totalling 460,619 ha in area
compared with 1,700 farms and 311,700 ha estimated by appraisal. Nearly 40%
of the amounts loaned for farm development were spent on the purchase of
livestock (Table 8). Next came expenditures on pasture development and farm
buildings which amounted to about 20% each. The balance went mainly for
machinery, irrigation, electrification and water reticulation. Expenditures
on livestock as a percentage of total expenditures were in line with appraisal
estimates but those on pasture development were about a third lower.
Expenditures on farm buildings as a percentage of total expenditures were 50%
higher than appraisal estimates and those on farm machinery 50% lower. There
were minor differences between Project Areas in investment percentages on
livestock and pasture development. Expenditures on buildings and machinery
were proportionately greater in the Northern Project Area due to the
construction of dairy sheds, milking parlours and trench silos and the



- 13 -
purchase of milking equipment and silage making machinery.    Irrigation
expenditures in the Southwest Project Area were lower than projected by
appraisal because fewer farms of that type were developed there.
3.09     Development of Communal Land.   The LDA initiated preparations for
implementing this component of the Project first by opening a new regional
office in the Galicia Region soon after appraisal in early 1974 to work
closely with the General Directorate of: Agrarian Reform in formulating the
communal land development program requested by the Bank (para. 2.05) and in
selecting five communal areas suitable for development into livestock farms
during the first five years of Project implementation as stipulated in Section
5.01(b) of the Loan Agreement. The LDA continued to promote communal land
development after the Loan was declared effective and generated interest among
27 communities. Farm development plans were subsequently prepared for these
communities but none were financed.
3.10     The LDA was somewhat more successful in developing communal land in
other less densely populated parts of Northern Spain outside the Galicia
Region. This was done indirectly on farms whose owners had secured long-term
leases to nearby communal grazing land from the municipal councils concerned.
The long-term loans granted for the development of these farms were, however,
secured by mortgages on property and by personal guarantees. Expenditures on
the leased communal grazing areas were minimal and went mainly towards meeting
recurrent costs such as fertilizers rather than towards capital developments.
These farms totalled 86 in number and about 66,000 ha in area for which
long-term loans amounting to Ptas 336 million were granted (Table 9).
3.11     Cancellations and Rescheduling.   About 7% of the number of loans
granted representing arouad 6% of the funds lent were cancelled (Table 10).
Another 17% of the number of loans granted representing 4% of the funds lent
were rescheduled. There were no marked differences in the rates of
cancellations and reschedulings of loans between the two Project areas.
Failure to carry out part or all of the farm improvements agreed upon in the
development plans and forced sale of livestock in the Southwest Project Area
during the drought years of 1980 and 1981 were the main causes for
rescheduling. Failure to abide by the conditions of the loans and
unauthorized sales of livestock financed by farm development loans were on the
other hand the main reasons for cancelLations.
3.12     Working Capital Loans.   Appraisal projections included a sum of Ptas
1,386.2 million (US$ 23.9 million) in Project costs for loans to finance
incremental working capital. These were to be provided by the Spanish
onlending banks where required. No such loans were, however, required during
the course of Project implementation.
C. Technical Services
3.13     Farm Development.   During the six year period of Project
implementation LDA technicians processed a total of 6,208 applications and
prepared a total of 1,958 farm development plans of which 1,589 were approved



- 14 -
(Table 4). The average technician prepared about four farm development plans
annually during the lifetime of the Project and about five during the peak
years of 1977-1979. Each development plan, on average, required about four
farm visits.
3.14     Monitoring of Farms.   The LDA monitored about 25% of the farms in the
Northern Project Area and the data collected provided valuable feedback
information for the preparation of new farm development plans. Attempts to
monitor farms in the Southwest Project Area were not as successful because
many were being managed by absentee landlords with hired labor. Consequently,
there is a shortage of information on sub-borrower performance in this project
area.
3.15     Staff Training.   A total of 57 technicians attended courses within
Spain during the six-year period of Project implementation and 44 were sent
abroad on study tours. The training covered a wide spectrum of topics related
to livestock production and cost to about Ptas 12.9 million.
3.16     Research.  The research activities of LDA were in the main focused on
pasture development and in many cases were collaborative efforts with the
National Agricultural Research Institute (Instituto Nacional de
Investigaciones Agrarias, INIA). In the Southwest Project Area emphasis was
on screening subterranean clover cultivars to find varieties suitable for the
different ecological zones of the area; on trace mineral deficiency studies,
particularly molybdenum; and on production of legume seed innoculums. These
innoculums are being produced by INIA for the farming community and are
readily available in the project area. In the Northern Project Area, research
efforts were directed mainly at gorse clearing, pasture establishment and soil
fertility problems, particularly lime, phosphorous, molybdenum and copper.
Many results have already been published and others are in the process of
preparation, particularly a book on pasture development in southern Spain by
LDA technicians.
3.17     Publications.   The LDA prepared and published a national livestock
development program in January 1980. Other publications included six year
books, four conference proceedings, 15 bulletins, 14 articles, and 198
technical notes.
3.18     Recruitment of Seed Production Specialist.    The Loan provided funds
for the recruitment of a seed production specialist within one year of the
Effective Date of the Loan to assist Government in developing a seed
production program in Spain (Loan Agreement Section 3.02(b)). A Bank
supervision mission reviewed the matter in June 1977, and recommended that
this commitment be waived because Government's seed production program had met
with considerable success. Spanish authorities were therefore advised in due
course that the Bank would consider waiver of the above covenant on receipt of
an official request but there is no record on Bank files indicating that one
was received.



- 15 -
3.19     Recruitment of Livestock Consultant.   The Loan also provided funds
for the employment of at least one livestock consultant (Loan Agreement
Section 3.02(a)). Two were recruited in January 1976, one for each project
area. The Southwestern area consultant was unable to surmount language and
communication problems and served only six-months. The Nothern area
consultant performed very well and his appointment was extended for a total of
three years. The Bank was consulted on all those actions and expressed
agreement with them.
D. Livestock Procurement Service
3.20     Procurement of Breeding Cattle.   The Ministry of Agriculture did not
operate a formal livestock procurement service along the lines indicated in
Schedule 4B of the Loan Agreement but instead subsidized the acquisition of
qualified young animals by cattle farmers, namely one free heifer for every
two animals purchased front approved lots. The LDA also assisted farmers in
locating and selecting suitable animals. Breeding cattle were bought for
Project farms without difficulty.
E. Accounts and Audits
3.21     Accounts were kept by ICO in respect of the Project and by LDA.
These accounts were audited by the General Accounting Office as indicated in
Section 4.02(b) of the Loan Agreement and as is Government practice in Spain.
Procedures followed were satisfactory.
F. Reports
3.22     The LDA was not bound under the Loan Agreement to prepare progress
reports on the Project and did not do so. The livestock development
activities of the agency were however briefly summarized in a series of six
yearbooks (1976-81). The LDA was also not bound under the Loan Agreement to
prepare a completion report on the Project but agreed to do so at Bank
request. A Spanish first draft copy of the report was obtained by the
completion mission, and it. was heavily drawn upon in the preparation of the
present report.
G. Disbursements from thet Bank Loan
3.23     Bank disbursements from the Loan were more than one year behind
appraisal estimates in starting and from then on gradually built up momentum.
The initial delay was caused by the postponement of the Effectiveness Date
from mid-September 1975 tc, mid-December 1975, which essentially meant the loss
of one whole year so far c!s pasture establishment and pasture consolidation
were concerned. The subsequent sluggish buildup of disbursements was largely
due to slow rediscounting of farm development loans with ICO by the onlending
banks. Many such banks simply held on to the loans they had granted and
forwarded them to ICO in batches, either when they were in need of funds or
when the loans exceeded a certain number or amount. The LDA also contributed
to the slow buildup of Bark disbursements by initially spreading expenditures



- 16 -
on farm development over a period of seven years and not five as expected at
appraisal. Bank disbursements totalled US$31.2 million ( US$15.7 million in
the Northern Project Area, US$15.5 million in the Southwest Area), absorbing
the US$28.5 million provided in Schedule I of the Loan Agreement for farm
development loans and the US$2.7 million unallocated. Bank disbursements on
technical services were in line with the funds provided by the Loan totalling
US$1.8 million.
IV. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT OF PROJECT
A. Overview
4.01     The Project was successful in disseminating modern livestock farming
technology throughout Spain and in strengthening the technical capabilities of
LDA. The LDA was also successful in mobilizing livestock development funds
from provincial and rural savings banks, securing staff and/or offices from
provincial governments, and concluding an agreement with BCA calling for
technical collaboration on future livestock development programs funded by
Government. The LDAs regional offices and staff were transferred to State
Government as of January 1, 1982, and are now functioning, more or less,
independently of Headquarters in Madrid on all non Bank-financed livestock
development activities.
B. Dissemination of Modern Livestock Farming Technology
4.02     The modern livestock farming technology introduced into parts of
southwestern and northern Spain under the First Livestock Project was
disseminated under this Project to virtually all parts of the country through
the granting of nearly 1,600 long-term farm development loans. This
technology is now widely accepted by the farming community, the banking sector
and the Ministry of Agriculture and includes:
(a) the establishment of new pastures and the renovation of old ones;
(b) the improvement of livestock housing and handling facilities
such as barns, sheds, fences, silos, milking parlors, stock
yards and farm machinery;
(c) the provision of extension and animal health services, the
former to assist farmers in planning, developing, operating and
managing their farms and the latter to protect their animals
from disease; and
(d) the supply of long-term loans to finance farm development costs
and livestock purchases.
The accent throughout was on production of inexpensive nutritious pastures
and/or forage crops; on better management of animals and pastures; and on
long-term planning, extension and supervision. Pastures were based on



- 1 7 -
subterranean clover in the southwest and on temperate perennial legumes and
grasses in the north. The cost of conventional fencing to properly utilize
and manage these pastures, however, became progressively more prohibitive as
the Project progressed and led to wider use of cheaper electric fencing
systems operated from mains or batteries. This trend towards electric fencing
will no doubt spread in the future with the introduction of high voltage solar
energizers developed in New Zealand during recent years.
4.03     Surveys of cattle breeding farms carried out by LDA in southwest
Spain have shown that the livestock development package described above can
increase stocking rates by about 50% (from around 0.16 cows/ha to around 0.24
cows/ha) and calving rates by about 10 to 15 percentage points (from around
65%-70% to around 80%). These increases can raise weaner liveweight
production by about 75%-100% (from around 23-25 kg/ha to around 40-50kg/ha).
Improvements in lamb production have not been reported by LDA for southwest
Spain but are estimated at about 100%-125%/ha. Monitoring records kept on
dairy farms in the Northern Project Area have also shown that the same package
can increase stocking rates by more than 100% (from around 1.30 cows/ha
toaround 2.7 cows/ha) and milk production in cows by 20%-25% (from around
3,500 liter/cow to around 4,300 liter/cow), and at the same time reduce
concentrate consumption by about 25% (from about 2,300 kg/cow to 1,700
kg/cow). Production coefficients for the different types of livestock farming
in other parts of the country would be influenced greatly by weather, rainfall
and soil type but should range between the figures quoted above for the
Southwestern and Northern Project Areas.
C. Institutional Development of the LDA
4.04     Offices, Staff and Budgets.   Three general directors headed the LDA
between January 1976 and Mlarch 1982, while the Project was being implemented.
The first was in office until September 1977, the second until December 1980
and the third is still in post. The LDA operated out of one headquarters
office in Madrid and five regional offices in Coruna, Santander, Leon, Madrid
and Sevilla when the ProjEct was started in early 1976 (Table 11). The staff
then totalled 104 and consisted of: 7 veterinarians, 21 agricultural
engineers, 37 agricultural technicians and 39 support staff. Although the
General Director had indicated more than a year earlier (para. 2.08) that he
had been authorized to fi]l 68 "permanent" positions, only he and four others
held such appointments ancl all the rest were still on annual contracts (Table
12). Most were dissatisfied with and suspicious of these contracts, first
because they did not provide job security, career prospects, retirement
benefits or cost-of-living adjustments, and second because they hinted that
Government might consider disbanding thte LDA after the Bank-financed project
was completed.
4.05     Three additional regional offices and 13 new provincial offices were
opened up during the first: four years of project implementation to give LDA
complete coverage over the northern, southern, western and central parts of
the country (Table 11). Staff numbers were increased to 236 by early 1982
including 49 on secondment: to LDA from various provincial governments,



- 18 -
namely: 32 veterinarians, 32 agricultural engineers, 77 agricultural
technicians and 95 support staff (Table 12). The conditions of employment
with LDA were also improved starting in early 1978 with the award of
"dedicacion exclusiva" appointments (more pay for more work), to regional
managers and "funcionarios permanentes" appointments (permanent) to technical
and support staff and by early 1982 virtually all the technicians (104) and
most of the office employees (65) were on such contracts. These appointments
greatly improved staff salaries and benefits and gave LDA employees the
recognition and security they had long sought. Government support of LDA was
further manifested by increased budgetary allocations which rose from about
Ptas 163 million in 1976 to around Ptas 423 million in 1981, i.e. a 160%
increase (Table 13). Income generated from technical fees represented only
about 20% of LDA expenditures during the peak years of farm development
(1977-1980) and the balance was financed through the government's regular
budget.
4.06     Work Program.   The General Director of LDA got the Project underway
in early 1976 by according priority to the recruitment of staff, the
establishment of new field offices and the development of livestock farms.
His successor, who took up office in September 1977, continued to implement
the Project with vigor but soon concluded that the farm development funds
provided by the Loan were fast being committed and that the prospects of a
third livestock development loan from the Bank were uncertain at best. He
therefore commissioned his staff to:
(a) prepare a national livestock development program in which LDA
was to play the lead technical role; and
(b) mount a campaign aimed at marketing LDA's technical expertise to
individuals and organizations interested in promoting and
financing livestock development in the country.
The General Director also added six provinces to the Project Area- three on
each of two separate occasions--in January 1978 and August 1978 (para. 3.01)
and initiated LDA activities independently of the Project in three other
provinces, thereby extending the agency's presence over all livestock
producing areas of southern, western, northern and central Spain.
4.07     The national livestock development program was drafted in August
1979, and was published by the Ministry of Agriculture in January 1980. This
advocated the expenditure of Ptas 20 billion over a five-year period to
quadruple the carrying capacity of some 500,000 ha to around 200,000 animal
units!1. The program was well received by provincial governments and by the
banking sector and led LDA into concluding agreements with:
(a) 17 provincial governments for the secondment of staff and/or the
provision of office space in return for LDA technical assistance
in livestock development;
1/ One animal unit (AU) equals one cow plus a calf or six sheep or six goats.



- 19 -
(b) 27 provincial savings banks and 19 rural savings banks under
which a total of about Ptas 6,300 million in private sector
funds were ccmmitted over a period of five years for medium- and
long-term livestock development credit (Table 14); and
(c) the BCA, for technical collaboration on Government funded
livestock development programs--about Ptas 5 billion budgeted
for 1982.
The national livestock development program also led to a series of directives
in the Official Gazette which essentially endorsed much of the livestock
development technology and terminology used by LDA. The LDA thus ended the
Project in early 1982 with larger and better livestock development
capabilities than in early 1976. Furthermore, these capabilities are now
fully recognized and actively sought by the Ministry of Agriculture, the
provincial governments, the banking sector and the farming community.
V. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
5.01     Project implementation was compromised by a marked deterioration in
the terms of trade of live:;tock enterprises. Cattle raising was the activity
most severely affected by this shift in relative prices; sheep raising was
somewhat less seriously af;fected.   Selected input and output price indexes and
variations in the financiaL rates of return of the main indicative farm models
are presented at Tables 15 and 16.
5.02     The increase in input prices was fairly uniform among the different
activities; beef prices, however, and to a lesser extent milk, lagged the most
behind the ascending current and capital input prices.     The impact was
particularly severe in the extensive cattle raising operations in the
Southwestern Project Area. Studies by LDA staff have concluded that the ratio
of prices received to prices paid in southwestern ranches improved slightly
during the early 1970s and reached a peak in 1976; after 1976 the ratio
worsened markedly and by 1981 it was over 20% below the 1976 level.
5.03     The Appraisal Report presented eight farm models that offered
financial rates of return ranging from 12 % for a 500-ha dryland cattle farm
to 39 percent for a 6-ha dairy farm and 100% for a 50-ha cattle fattening farm
(Table 16). Project developments were heavily concentrated in four of those
major models, namely;
(a)  extensive cattle raising in the Southwest;
(b) extensive sheep raising in the Southwest;
(c)  dairying in the North; ancl
(d) beef farming in the North.



- 20 -
5.04     The financial rate of return of the extensive cattle raising (500 ha)
model started at a modest level of 12% at appraisal and fell to 8% by 1977.
Beef prices recovered sharply in 1979, bringing the rate of return back to the
appraisal estimate, and fell markedly in 1980 as drought conditions worsened,
lowering the rate of return to below 1977 levels. By 1981 the price
relationships had stabilized and the estimated return had regained the 1977
level of 8%, where it currently stands. If the present situation is to be
interpreted as reflecting lasting changes in market conditions, the clear
inference is that livestock development policy in Spain has to be
reconsidered, as the relative price assumptions on which the extensive cattle
development component of the project was based seem no longer to apply (paras.
6.02 and 6.03).
5.05     The financial rates of return of the dryland sheep farm (24%) and the
dairy farm (39%) fell in 1977 by about one third from the appraisal estimates
to 15% and 25%, respectively. They have remained at approximately the same
level since then. Those activities, dairying in particular, remain
financially viable, in contrast to extensive cattle ranching in the Spanish
Southwest.
5.06     As established at appraisal, financial prices in Spain are not
basically different from World prices and are therefore used for economic
analysis. Subsidies are negligible in relation to aggregate costs. The
breakdown of farm investments undertaken under the project by type of activity
was approximately 45% for cattle raising, 30% for sheep farming, and 25% for
dairy farming. Using these proportions to weigh the corresponding rates of
return, a point estimate of the project's economic rate of return for purposes
of comparison with the 16 percent estimated at appraisal, would be 14
percent. This point estimate, however, is not very meaningful as it hides the
fact that a major project component (extensive cattle raising) has been
rendered economically unjustified by changes in factor and product markets.
VI. SPECIAL ISSUES
A. General
6.01     During implementation, the beef cattle breeding proposals adopted at
appraisal became unprofitable in the drier parts of the Southwestern
ProjectArea and unpopular with the farming community in the Northern Project
Area. Also, despite concerted efforts by LDA, the Project failed to develop
communally-owned grazing land in the Galicia Region.
B. Beef Farming in Southern Spain
6.02     Costs and Prices.   The capital and recurrent costs of farm
development rose more rapidly between 1976 and 1980 than the farm gate prices
of livestock products (para. 5.04). These disproportionate increases in costs
and prices lowered the financial rates of return on the beef breeding farm
models below acceptable levels in the Southwest Project Area, from 12% at



- 21 -
appraisal (1975) to 8% in 1981. Native pastures on farms in the drier parts
of this project area have low carrying capacities and, although stocking rates
can be doubled and calving rates increased by 15 percentage points (para.
4.03), such farms simply cannot generate the revenue to pay for the inputs
needed to transform them from an undeveloped to a developed state at present
costs and prices. This situation was further aggravated by droughts which led
to destocking, and to rescheduling and cancellation of loans on many cattle
breeding farms particularly in 1980 and 1981. The same disproportionate
increases in costs and prices also lowered the profitability of cattle
fattening on irrigated farins in the Southwest Project Area and as a result
only about a quarter of the farms projected by the appraisal mission to
participate were financed by the Project (Table 7).
b.03     Development of Cattle Breeding and Cattle Fattening Farms.    The LDA
faced the challenge of rising costs and stagnating prices by: (a) selecting
partially developed cattle farms instead of undeveloped ones to minimize costs
and maximize returns; (b) concentrating on inputs with high production
benefits such as livestock purchases, pasture rehabilitation, and stock yards
to improve management and animal health and by reducing investments in
housing, irrigation, farm machinery and pasture development which, by
comparison, were expensive; (c) placing greater emphasis on the development of
farms based on sheep and goats because these animals are better suited to low
rainfall areas, are more resistant to droughts and give quicker returns than
cattle and also because sheep and goat farms are usually cheaper to develop
than cattle farms; and (d) approving loans on the basis of cash flow analysis
and rescheduling or canceLling loans when farmers got into financial
difficulties.
C. Beef Farming in Northern Spain
6.04     Although beef fa-ning system remained profitable in the North despite
the changes in relative prices (para 5.05), farmers did not show much interest
in either beef breeding or beef fattening and preferred instead to develop
dairy farms which gave quicker and higher returns.
D. Development of Communal Land
6.05     Categories of Coimunal Land.   Communal grazing lands in Spain are
divided into two major categories on the basis of ownership and
administration.
(a) "Montes Comiuunales en Mano Comun" - referred to as Bienes
Propios in the appraisal report . These are found throughout
Spain and were initially established under Roman Law. They are
owned by individual municipalities and are administered by
municipal boards. The boards usually rent the grazing areas
under their jurisdiction to the highest bidder for one to ten
years giving first priority to the inhabitants of the municipal
district concerned. Areas not being used by the inhabitants of
a village can be rented to outsiders but are usually leased to

forestry development and are then known as "Montes
Consorciados". Some of the montes communales have a "public use
designation" and are then known as "Montes de Utilidad
Publica." These are usually administered by ICONA and not by
municipal boards. They are sometimes rented out by ICONA for
1-10 years but with a restriction on investments for the
improvement of infrastructure.
(b)  "Montes Vecinales en Mano Comun" - referred to as Bienes
Communales in the appraisal report. These are found in the
Galicia Region and in the provinces of Asturias and Zamora.
They were initially established under Germanic Law and are
collectively owned by the inhabitants of individual villages. A
"Junta de los Vecinos" or neighborhood board is elected annually
by each village to administer the montes vecinales and to attend
to other village affairs. Village communities in the
undeveloped rural areas of northwestern Spain are highly
suspicious of outsiders over the issue of montes vecinales
because historically many had lost control over and eventually
ownership of these lands when "Ayuntamientos" were made
responsible for their administration in the 16th Century and
because they had only recently regained rights to them under the
Rey de Montes of 1957. The ayuntamientos were essentially rural
administrations consisting of several parishes or "parochias"
each of which was in turn made up of several villages or
l"aldeas".
6.06     Development of Montes Communales.   The Project was instrumental in
improving the utilization of leased montes communales on 86 farms in several
northern provinces outside the Galicia Region but did not alter the status quo
or set any precedents so far as land tenure was concerned (para. 3.10). The
fixed term leases to montes communales remained unnegotiable. These areas did
not attract any development capital but were simply used to supplement grazing
on the nearby home farms which were themselves being developed by their owners
under the Project with conventionally secured loans.
6.07     Development of Montes Vecinales.   The Project provided funds for the
development of 400 livestock farms on communal land in the Galicia Region.
This in effect meant the establishment of new livestock farms on bare
montesvecinales for the inhabitants of about 400 villages and, in practical
terms, the borrowing of money for building farms, dairies, sheds, fences and
roads; developing and renovating pastures; and buying livestock and
agricultural machinery. The LDA was expected to launch this program by
first: (a) publicizing Government's montes vecinales development proposals in
the rural areas of Galicia; (b) generating interest among the villages of the
Galicia Region in establishing livestock farms on montes vecinales and in
borrowing money for the purpose; and (c) cooperating with banking institutions
in preparing guidelines and procedures for extending long-term credits to
village communities for the establishment of livestock farms on montes
vecinales.



- 23 -
6.08     The LDA was reasonably successful in publicizing the program and in
generating interest within a number of villages in developing such farms, but
made no headway in convincing either the banking sector in extending credit or
the village communities in borrowing money and posting personal property as
collateral for the purpose because the Land Reform Law of 1973, on which this
component of the Project is based, did not affect the ownership of montes
vecinales but merely authorized their Lease. In the final analysis such lands
were still communally owned and were therefore inalienable, nonnegotiable and
unlikely to attract any development capital from the banking sector because
prevailing laws banned their mortgage or sale.
VII. BORROWER AND BANK PERFORMANCE
7.01     Borrower's Performance.   The Borrower accorded priority to Project
implementation and supported LDA by awarding permanent contracts to staff, by
improving salaries and benefits, by recruiting new employees, by opening
additional offices, and by increasing budgetary allocations, thereby giving
the agency a secure future within the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food and a clear mandate over the country's livestock development affairs
(paras. 3.13, 4.05 and 4.06). The three General Directors who headed LDA
while the Project was being implemented all followed a common policy that was
responsible for strengthening the technical capabilities of the agency and for
extending modern livestock development technology to all parts of Spain
through the development of about 1,600 livestock farms (paras. 3.06 and
4.05). The agency also showed initiative and foresight by preparing a
national livestock development plan and marshalling the cooperation of the
Central Goverment, provincial administrations and the banking sector to
actively support this plan. As a result, the livestock development activities
undertaken under the two Bank-financed livestock projects have continued
(para. 4.06, 4.07). However, the agency would be well advised to accord
greater emphasis to monitoring the performance of livestock farms in the lower
rainfall areas of Spain than has been the case so far.
7.02     Bank Performance.   The Bank supervised the Project on ten different
occasions during the six years of project implementation. Seven staff members
spent a total of 26.3 manweeks on these missions. The Bank also financed two
consultancy studies, one on soil fertility and the other on pasture research.
7.03     Bank supervision missions initially focussed on resolving LDA's
staffing problems, on expediting the credit program, on accelerating loan
disbursements and on initiating the development of communal grazing lands in
the Galicia Region. Later on the missions also became involved in furthering
LDA's continued participation in the country's livestock development programs
after this Project came to an end. All the above problems were eventually
resolved except the development of communal land in the Galicia Region.
During all this time, the: discussions with Spanish authorities were always
frank and cordial.
VIII. LESSON LEARNT
8.01     The Project clearly demonstrated two principal ingredients of
successful agricultural credit projects namely;



- 24 -
(a) sound technological packages capable of significantly increasing
productivity in the areas being developed; and
(b) effective extension capabilities to disseminate these packages
among the farming communities concerned.
These ingredients are mentioned here merely to emphasize their importance in
the design of such projects.
8.02     The Project showed that:
(a) sheep and goat farms are more profitable than beef farms in the
dryer parts of the country (para. 6.03);
(b) beef breeding farms in the dry parts of Spain have become
financially unprofitable if they require transformation from an
undeveloped to a developed state by heavy capital investments
during the first two or three years. Instead, smaller
investments in partially developed farms on items known to
generate the greatest benefits were demonstrated to be the best
means of minimizing costs and maximizing returns (para. 2.02);
and
(c) development of communal grazing land is unlikely under
prevailing laws and farmer attitudes concerning the ownership
and administration of such land (paras. 6.06 and 6.07).

Dear Sir,
We just received the copy of the draft which means the first step
of the whole process of the Departament Project Evaluation in order to -
get the final report of the Second L.D.P. of Spain. So, the final project
Completion Report, needs as you say in your letter, our approval of the -
draft received.
In our opinion, due to the fact that the draft it is based on a -
previous document done by our technical staff which it was discused with
Dr. Koury and Dr. 3allesteros, we agree in all the main conclusions expo-
sed,and the reasons which are pointed out in the document received are in
line with our wiews of the subject. However, before October you will reci
ve more detailed comments about the draft.
We always beJeved on the success of that Loan. Unfortunatly the -
development of the beef farms in the Southwest of the Country failed a li
ttle by the lack of cashflow generated with the necesary investiment and
low return of the beef cow.
The develooment of farms loans in the "Montes Comunales" of Gali-
cia it is mainly a social and legal problem which at the present it is -
away of our posibilities.
Tharking your good preparation of the draft and with our regards
to all your people involved in the project.
Sincerely yours.
EL SUEBDIRECTOR GENERAL DE LA
PRODJOCION ANIMAL
Joaquin   de ndez
Ps: I enclose the first draft of   e Spanish document that it was utili-
ced as I mentioned above    your people during their stay.

Dea.- Sir.
Thank you very much for your letter and the enclosed draft about
the first stage of the Evaluation Report of the II loanagreement, that        I
received just before the and of my holidays in August.
I replay to you as the actual Technical Director of Programs ---
(Director de Programas) of the Agencia. Some months ago, due to the fact
of an small reorganisation within the Ministery of Agriculture, I left the
direction of the "Agencia de Desarrollo Ganadero".
At the moment, all the previous director's functions are carried
out by the deputy general director of animal production (Subdirector Gene-
ral de Producci6n Animal). According to the new organisation, the figure
of director of the Agencia does not exist any more. However, the organism
Keeps all its commitements with the farmers and the objetives of its work,
and so its annual budjet as before (Organismo Aut6nomo). I have sent the
draft and your letter to the actual "Director" : Joaguin Serna Hernandez
who I think he will write to you as well soon.
I have a look to the document, and I agree in all the main con--
clusions of the draft. I remember that we discused the matters with the -
two experts that stay with us in November.
I hope we will be in contact ih the near future, you will have -
all my colaboration as I did before. I thik that will be a sucess the fi-
nal completion report of this second livestock Developement Program, as it
has been the impact of the Agencia de Desarrollo Ganadero on the develope-
ment of the livestock industry on the extensive areas and ofcourse in dai-
ry farms of the North of the country.
Sincerely yo
