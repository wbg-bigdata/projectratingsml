INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO FOR
A PETROLEUM SECTOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the People's Republic of the Congo for the equivalent of US$5
million to finance a Petroleum Sector Technical Assistance Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report entitled "People's Republic of the
Congo - Economic Trends, Current Issues, and Prospects" (report No. 2213-
COB) was distributed to the Board on June 8, 1979. Its conclusions are
integrated in this report.
Structure and Potential
3.        With an area of about 340,000 km2 and a highly urbanized and
unevenly distributed population of about 1.3 million inhabitants, the Congo
occupies a strategic position on a transport corridor that reaches into
Central Africa and provides access to the Atlantic Ocean at the country's
second largest city, Pointe Noire. Prior to 1972 the per capita GNP was
modest but, with the start of oil production in that year, per capita income
rose reaching US$500 by the end of 1977.
4.        The economy is heavily dependent on import substitution manufactur-
ing, transit transport, trade, and Government services. In part, this results
from the priority given to the Congo's regional role in administration and
trade during colonial days and from subsequent Government development poli-
cies. Agriculture occupies more than 50 percent of the population but has
been declining in importance and now accounts for only 10 percent of the GDP.
Crop production was adversely affected throughout the 1970s by high rural-
urban migration, labor problems, and a decade of neglect of smallholders by
the Government. Forestry provided the main export during the late 1960s and
the early 1970s and was a major stimulant of downstream activities,
particularly transport, but timber production contributes little to GDP
directly due to its low value added. Mining was not a significant contributor
to GDP prior to 1973/74.



-2-
5.        Large scale oil production began in 1972, boosting value added in
mining from 3 percent of GDP to 19 percent by 1974. Between 1974-78, varia-
tions in oil production triggered the expansion and contraction of GDP.
Government oil income rose to an average 30 percent of budgetary revenues
between 1974 and 1978. During the same period, crude oil accounted for the
bulk of merchandise exports and, together with rapidly rising oil export
prices, substantially contributed to dampening the effect of import price
inflation on the overall balance of payments.
6.        A striking feature of the Congolese economy is the size of the
public sector. In 1977/78, Government spending accounted for about 30 percent
of the GDP. The para-statal sector, with about 85 financially-autonomous
entities, dominates modern sector agriculture, manufacturing and services.
The growth of Government employment, now at about one civil servant for every
26 Congolese, has been exacerbated by rising enrollment rates in the Congo's
obsolescent educational system and the long-standing Government practice of
hiring all high school and university graduates who could not find jobs
elsewhere.
7.        The country's development potential is promising although there
are numerous constraints. Agricultural and forestry services remain largely
unexploited. The Congo's non-oil mineral wealth is little known while the
petroleum potential is not yet fully explored. In public enterprises, sub-
stantial excess capacity exists and, with appropriate policies and minimum
investments, a resumption of growth is feasible. The country's heavy
river-rail-port transport system, the Agence Transcongolaise des Communica-
tions (ATC) is facing major problems and has yet to reach its full potential.
The hydroelectric potential is considered substantial but the low level of
demand and long transport hauls are significant constraints on early
development.
Past Performance
8.        During the 1960s real GDP grew by approximately 4 percent per year.
The Government pursued a moderate socialist program, expanding the public
sector only gradually while attempting to improve smallholder agriculture.
The period saw the surge of forestry development in southern Congo which
stimulated transport and related services and boosted exports. Manufacturing
expanded as investment opportunities for import substitution were taken up,
mostly by foreign private investors. The bulk of public investment was
financed by external sources at concessional terms.
9.        A new Government came to power in 1968 committed to accelerating
the establishment of a socialist state. At the same time, resource prospects
improved with the discovery of oil and optimistic forecasts of future produc-
tion rates. Rapid expansion of the public enterprise sector followed as some
existing enterprises (transport, water and power distribution, agro-indus-
tries) were taken over by the Government. Later, new ventures were entered
into (petro'eum refinery, small scale industries, the state farm system)
financed by foreign loans on commercial terms. Between 1970 and 1972 the
outstanding debt doubled to CFAF 74 billion or 83 percent of the 1972 GDP.



-3-
However, the expansion of the public sector lead to a serious decline in
production due to inadequaLte management, overemployment and lack of working
capital. Simultaneously investments in the private sector (except in
petroleum) stagnated as the most obvious investment opportunities in
manufacturing were exhausted and the business climate became uncertain.
10.       The Government supported the failing public enterprises with sub-
sidies while continuing to expand civil service employment and educational
opportunities. These policies accelerated the rate of Government spending,
reduced the efficiency of formerly productive enterprises, distorted the
allocation of resources and led to an alarming public finance situation. In
1972, the Treasury deficit had reached 20 percent of budgetary revenues and
was financed throughout 1969-72 largely by accumulating arrears to public and
private suppliers and creditors. Rising domestic consumption and the high
rate of public and private investment financed from abroad widened the
resource gap which stood at 26 percent of the GDP in 1972.
11.       In 1973/74 significant increases in revenues from oil production
temporarily arrested the deterioration of the economy. The quadrupling of oil
prices and a peak output of 2.4 million tons in 1974 resulted in a major
improvement in the country's terms of trade, a consequent increase in the
capacity to import, a doubling of budgetary revenues between 1972 and 1974, an
even larger increase in exports, and a tenfold rise in foreign exchange
reserves. Although domestic consumption and investment also escalated, the
sharp rise in gross domestic income helped reduce the resource gap to 11
percent of GDP. The rise in public expenditure was channeled towards the
rescue of the failing public enterprise sector, new investments and an
increase in civil service wages by an average of 30 percent.
12.       Between 1975-77, real GDP fell by about 2.5 percent/year.  Unfore-
seen geological difficulties in a major offshore oil field (Emeraude) brought
about a fall in petroleumL output by 25 percent in 1975 and production remained
below the 1974 level until 1978, when a second offshore oil field was put into
production. In 1977, the irreparable flooding of a potash mine further
depressed the mining sector, while the stagnation of activities in other
sectors aggravated the effects of reduced oil production. Public sector
manufacturing continued t:o decline as the Government, in financial difficulty,
was unable to continue to subsidize the sector. Several enterprises had to
close down or reduce their output resulting in a sharp rise in unemployment.
Forestry production decliLned owing to depressed demand in industrial coun-
tries, the long-run depletion of the most easily accessible forests in coastal
areas and transport probLems which impeded the development of new resources in
enclave regions. Exploitation of forestry resources also became unattractive
to private companies because of Government measures to monopolize the
marketing of logs which added to the uncertainty of logging in the Congo
and led to the departure of many small- and medium-scale foreign operators.
In turn, the stagnation of forestry seriously undermined the financial
position of the national railway, the ATC.
13.       At that time, the ATC's foreign debt obligations were escalating as
it undertook a large modernization program, which included the realignment of



-4-
part of the CFCO railway. This program was financed by a large group of
multilateral and bilateral sources, including the Bank. Major problems are
being encountered in the completion of the project which is plagued by
substantial cost overruns.
Public Finances since 1975
14.       When oil production fell in 1975, the Government drastically reduced
its investment program but the wage bill could not be compressed, and a
huge Treasury deficit of CFAF 21 billion, or about 50 percent of 1975 reve-
nues, resulted. Only half of the deficit could be covered by domestic and
foreign borrowing and arrears thus rose sharply. In the following two years,
budgetary revenues remained depressed and the Government further reduced its
investment program. Nevertheless, the wage bill continued to rise and the
external debt service became unsustainable as loans on commercial terms,
committed in the 1970-75 period, came to maturity. Even after exhausting most
sources of deficit finance--including advances by the oil companies and
large-scale bilateral borrowing to sustain public consumption--a substantial
budgetary gap remained financed largely by arrears (including about 25 percent
of maturities on the external debt). At the end of 1978, total Treasury
arrears had reached CFAF 60 billion or 100 percent of 1978 budgetary revenues.
15.       The Government's liquidity problems exacerbated the financial
problems of public enterprises since operating subsidies had to be curtailed
and the Government was unable to pay for goods and services. Public entities
responded by withholding taxes owed to the Government, further aggravating the
Treasury's liquidity position. In 1976, the only year for which a consoli-
dated profit and loss statement is available for the majority of public
enterprises, the sector as a whole was in deficit with expenditures exceeding
revenues by about 5 percent.
Balance of Payments
16.       The vulnerability of the domestic economy to international
market fluctuations and urban consumption patterns is reflected in the
balance of payments. Before the oil boom, the current account deficit
steadily widened reaching 31 percent of GDP in 1972. It was covered by
capital inflows from public and private sources so that, on the average,
the overall balance was slightly positive. In 1973/74, the current balance
improved and, in 1974, a large overall surplus was recorded. Subsequently
the overall balance steadily deteriorated owing to depressed exports,
import price inflation, rising interest payments on the public and private
debt and stagnating capital inflows. The deficit reached CFAF 10.6 billion
in 1978 or 16 percent of exports. The persistent deficits on the overall
balance were financed by arrears of payment and drawing down reserves of
the central bank and commercial and development banks which, in May 1979,
stood at US$11 million or less than one month of merchandise imports.
Money and Credit
17.       The effect of the financial difficulties of the public sector on
the banking system's ability to extend credit was delayed. In 1975/76, the



- 5 -
system was liquid enough to continue to expand outstanding credit to the
Government and the private sector at an average 30 percent/year. In the
following two years credit extension decelerated sharply. The main causes
were the failure of public enterprises to repay short-term credits, thereby
exerting pressure on statutory liquidity ratios and the country's poor credit
image abroad which led foreign correspondents of Congolese banks to require
the domestic banking system to deposit abroad part of their liquid assets to
cover open letters of credit. This reduced the liquidity available to the
domestic economy and produced a de facto increase in minimum reserve require-
ments.
The External Debt
18.       At the end of 1978, the outstanding external debt (including
undisbursed amounts) was estimated at CFAF 197 billion, or 110 percent of
the 1978 GNP. On the basis of public debt servicing obligations (excluding
accumulated arrears), the overall debt service ratio stood at 14 percent
while the Government's debt service obligations accounted for 19 percent of
1978 budgetary revenues. During the 1975-78 period, arrears were accumulated
on about 25 percent of the public debt service obligations, so that arrears of
principal and interest stood at about CFAF 13 billion at the end of 1978. As
the Congo's credit image abroad worsened, the borrowing terms hardened and the
Government was increasingly unable to obtain development finance at normal
terms. Although the Government was able to reschedule part of its debt
service with bilateral donors throughout 1976-78, public debt servicing
obligations are still expected to rise in the next three to four years. This
would place an added burden on scarce public sector resources unless further
substantial debt rescheduling and refinancing can be obtained.
Current Programs
19.       Throughout 1975-78, the Government attempted to adjust to shortfalls
in revenues by reducing its investment outlays, cutting subsidies to public
enterprises, reducing the retirement age of civil servants and imposing
salary deductions on salaLried employees. To improve financial administration
and provide for some investment financing from domestic resources, the Govern-
ment isolated its investment fund from Treasury control and is presently
earmarking resources, including the salary deductions, for investments. In
1978 the Government initiated a two-year action program totalling CFAF 130
billion aimed at rehabilitating the public sector, completing ongoing programs
and launching a minimum number of new ventures. While overambitious in its
scope and time frame, the program has enabled the Government to focus on some
critical issues in rehabilitating the public sector such as improving finan-
cial reporting and monitoring, adjusting salary scales to productivity in the
country's state farms and enforcing better management.  To restore the produc-
tivity of large industrial public enterprises, the Government is seeking, with
some initial success, to conclude management contracts with foreign firms.
20.       An attempt at implementing a comprehensive financial stabilization
program is being undertaken within the framework of the 1979 IMF Second
Tranche Standby program. The program aims at reducing the o-erall level
of public arrears by CFAF 1 billion and limiting new external e tA undertak
ings of maturities of less than 15 years to CFAF 8 billion.  Thro. ¾ the



-6-
rescheduling of CFAF 7.4 billion of debt service obligations with bilateral
donors and oil companies, compressing public demand, stepping up the collec-
tion of tax arrears owed by public enterprises, and implementing selective tax
increases, the Government hopes to meet the program's objectives. Indica-
tions for the first semester of 1979 show that the rise in external arrears
has largely been arrested.
Current Issues and Prospects
21.       The present public finance impasse constitutes the most serious
handicap in pursuing a normal pace of development in the Congo. The size
of public liabilities will require a sustained medium-term stabilization
effort to allow the Government to reduce public consumption, contribute to
local and recurrent cost financing and improve its creditworthiness. An
essential element of a stabilization strategy will be to roll over the
country's large external debt but, in the absence of a comprehensive medium-
term stabilization program, there is little hope that the Congo will obtain
the level of debt relief that would be required to improve its finances. A
medium-term stabilization program would also falter in the absence of
measures by the Government to stimulate growth without which resource
generation would be insufficient and austerity measures would have to be
prolonged, with risks of serious social disruptions. The Government is
thus committed to undertaking such a program and considers short-term
scabilization measures to be intermediate steps to halt the financial
deterioration, reinforce monitoring institutions and undertake medium-term
development planning.
22.       The sectors that could contribute to growth in the medium- and
long-term are the following:
(a) Petroleum
Accelerating development of petroleum resources remains an
urgent need as increased oil revenues provide the only imme-
diate and medium-term solution to overcoming the Government's
financial problems.
(bj Forestry. The accelerated development of forestry resources
has the potential for launching the non-oil econorny on a
sustained growth path well into the 1990s. Aside from
transport constraints, Government marketing policies and
institutions appear to constitute a bottleneck to attracting
foreign private partners.  The Bank has pursued with the
Government an intensive dialogue on forestry poll.es during
the past year.
Transport.  The railway realignment project was designed to
relax north-south transport constraints and to facilitate
the development of northern forestry resources.  Improvements
in ATC's operations and finances are also being pursued with
the help of foreign assistance. As mentioned in Annex III,
the project is facing serious difficulties and a comprehensive
review of the railway transport program is now under way.



-7-
The Government is allocating some resources to the improve-
ment of feeder roads. However, major additional efforts will
be required to rehabilitate the road network which, as a
result of lack of maintenance, has deteriorated to the point
where many trunk roads have become impassable.
(d) The public enterprise sector. The rehabilitation of public
enterprises could provide a short- and medium-term impetus to
growth. The Government is carefully scrutinizing rehabilita-
tion programs and using public funds to provide credits to
those enterprises which have formulated acceptable programs.
Some enterprises are benefitting from management contracts
with foreign partners. The IMF program requires that the
Government undertake a generalized compensation of arrears
involving the Government and public enterprises that would help
to clarify the working capital position of public entities.
A commissicin has been appointed to this effect.
(e)  Smallholder agriculture.  Government programs emphasize
the rehabilitation of smallholder agriculture. A number of
new institutions have been set up or are being studied to
deliver services and credit to smallholders including two
autonomous extension and marketing boards for cash and food
crops, a price stabilization board and an agricultural
credit system.   Producer prices have recently been raised
by 15-30 percent although, on the average, they remain lower
than prices offered in traditional markets. A number of
bilateral aLnd multilateral aid agencies are financing or
studying caLsh and food crop development programs. An FAO/CP
mission has just completed a general sector identification
mission. Its report, including a number of sectoral issues,
will soon be discussed with Government officials.
23.       In summary, the Congo confronts serious financial difficulties
as well as structural obstacles to its economic development. Its compara-
tively high average per ca6pita income level is derived from a narrow
economic base of its regional transport network and mining sector. A large
proportion of the rural arnd urban population is poor. To support the
Government's efforts at stabilizing finances, expanding the opportunities
for economic growth in high priority sectors by influencing sector policies,
and fostering the transition to an economy with wider access to commercial
finance and capable of servicing debt on more conventional terms, external
aid agencies should extend concessional assistance to the Congo to finance
the foreign exchange and a, share of local project costs for the priority
sectors discussed above.



-8-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE CONGO
24.       Bank Group commitments in the People's Republic of the Congo
amount to US$97.9 million from three Bank loans (US$76 million) and seven
IDA credits (US$21.9 million)l/. Seven loans and credits totalling US$46
million have been fully disbursed. Ongoing projects include the Second
Education project, a Livestock Development project, and the Realignment of
the CFCO railway.   Annex II contains a summary statement of loans and
credits up to October 1979 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
25.       The transport sector is of essential importance not only to the
Congo itself, but also to neighboring countries. As a consequence, nearly
half of Bank Group lending to the country has been in this sector and both
IDA and the Bank have helped finance investments in the ATC system, and in
highways which link the ATC networks with Congo's major centers of economic
activity. As reported in Annex III, ATC is facing very serious difficulties
as is the realignment of the CFCO. Whatever reorganization of its program
results from discussions under way, additional financing will be required.
The Government and the Association are also planning to prepare a Second
Highway Maintenance project and a River Transport project.
26.       Improving the quality of education and reorienting it to the
manpower requirements of the economy are the main preoccupation of the
Government in the education sector. Our First Education project helped
with teacher training as well as vocational and technician training. The
Second Education project helps the training of forestry technicians and
teachers for primary and technical schools.
27.       A Livestock project is being implemented which aims at significantly
increasing local beef production, largely for consumption in major urban
areas. The purpose of the project is to reduce the country's dependence on
imported meat products.
28.       The Technical Assistance project proposed in this report would help
the Government improve sector management and strengthen the Government in its
dialogue with the foreign owned oil companies. An oil exploration project
aimed at directly accelerating exploration is also being considered by IFC.
29.       Throughout 1974-78, gross international public capital flows
(including debt refinancing and budgetary support) amounted to about US$600
million. At the end of 1978, the outstanding disbursed debt stood at US$690
million of which 9 percent was held by the Bank Group. The Bank Group share
in the public debt service is estimated at 6 percent for 1979 and at an
average 7 percent over the 1980-85 period. The proposed project will not
significantly alter the Bank Group's exposure.

PART III - THE PETROLEUM SECTOR
Introduction
30.       The petroleum produced in the Congo is exported in its entirety as
crude, while all refined petroleum products required for internal consumption
are imported. Consequent:Ly past and current developments in the petroleum
sector do not have any direct impact on demand or supply in the domestic
energy sector. For this reason only matters related to petroleum explora-
tion and production are discussed in the following paragraphs.
31.       The discovery oE large petroleum accumulations in the Congo in
the late 1960s and the sulbsequent development of these resources has had a
major impact on the economy. At present oil exports account for 70 percent
of merchandise exports an,d, throughout 1972-78, the balance of payments of
the oil sector was positive and helped to contain the deterioration in the
Congo's external finances in other sectors. In particular, the quadrupling
of oil prices at the end of 1973 produced a sharp and positive reversal in
the country's terms of trade, raising the Congo's capacity to import and
protecting the economy from the rapid import price inflation that occurred
between 1974 and 1978. Oil income in the form of income taxes and royal-
ties now accounts for 30 percent of total budgetary income.
32.       Although a small onshore oilfield, Pointe Indienne, was discovered
before independence, significant exploration efforts only started in 1968.
As of September 1979, three production concessions have been granted to
oil companies following offshore oil discoveries and recoverable reserves
from these fields have been estimated at 35-40 million tons. Over the past
three years, production of crude oil has averaged 2 million tons; from 1981
onwards, production is expected to reach 3.2 million tons per annum.
33.       However, much more exploration has to be carried out to evaluate
fully the Congo's petroleum potential. The deep offshore and a large onshore
sedimentary basin called the Cuvette, have barely been investigated; recent
progress in geophysics might enable oil companies to overcome geological
difficulties which so far have prevented identification of potential oil pros-
pects and should lead to the discovery of accumulations similar to those
which have been proved economic to develop in the neighboring enclave of
Cabinda and in Gabon.  Furthermore, accumulations discovered earlier and found
commercially unattractive may, with increasing oil prices, become commercially
viable.
34.       An increase in oil exports appears to constitute the best short-
and medium-term prospect for a resumption of economic growth and for an
improvement in public firnances. This could be achieved by development of
oil fields already discovered and an increase in the exploration effort
carried out by the oil companies. While the Government wishes to ensure
that the petroleum resour-ces are being explored and developed as quickly as
possible, the oil companies have expressed concern over the political risks
involved in operating in a country which has, in the past, altered the legal
and fiscal basis for its operations without prior consultatioa



- 10 -
35.       The Government recognizes this situation and acknowledges that
the establishment of stable relationships with oil companies, and providing
them with the right incentives to invest, particularly in exploration, must
remain important Government objectives.
Institutional Framework
36.       The Ministry of Mines and Energy has jurisdiction over the develop-
ment of mining resources, including petroleum resources; three departments
in the Ministry are in charge of Studies and Planning; Mining; and Energy
and Fuels respectively. The Mining Department is responsible for issues
relative to oil exploration, while the Energy and Fuel Department deals with
commercialization of inter alia oil products. While considerable efforts have
been made in defining the duties of each department, a critical shortage
of qualified and experienced staff has seriously limited the effectiveness of
the Ministry.
37.       In 1974, the Government nationalized the retail outlets of
foreign oil companies, and created HYDROCONGO, a national oil company in
charge of oil, transport, and distribution of oil products.l/   HYDROCONGO
presently imports and distributes all oil products consumed in the Congo.
With annual sales approaching US$80 million, HYDROCONGO is one of the
largest corporations operating in the Congo and it has a staff of 1,100,
including 120 at middle and senior management levels. HYDROCONGO is also
the agency in charge of the management of the Government's interest in
exploration/production agreements with foreign oil companies. As such,
HYDROCONGO has a minority interest (15 to 50 percent) in a number of oil
exploration permits granted recently, on which no discovery has yet been
made.  The presence of HYDROCONGO in oil exploration and development should
become more and more significant, since it will, henceforth, become associated
with all new ventures, without bearing the exploration risk. HYDROCONGO is
presently facing serious difficulties which are acknowledged by its management.
It is a young organization with vast responsibilities. It lacks sound
management information systems and budgetary control procedures and, taking
into account the scope of its activities, the financial management is
inadequate. There is general agreement, by the Government and HYDROCONGO,
that there is an urgent need for external assistance aimed at strengthening
the organization both in retailing of oil products and in oil exploration.
38.       The petroleum legislation is typical of former French colonies
in West Africa, and is, in fact, an offspring of the French "Code Petrolier"
which grants an exclusive right for exploration on a well defined area for
a given period. In the Congo, permits are for an initial period of five
years, and can normally be renewed twice for additional five-year periods;
1/ The foreign companies have been compensated with the exception of AGIP
which contested the amounts offered by the Government. This case has
been submitted to ICSID and a decision is expected before the end of
the year.



- 11 -
25 percent of the initial area has to be surrendered at the expiration of
each period.  The permit agreements provide for minimum levels of expendi-
tures by the permit holders over each five-year period. The permit
agreements also cover the fiscal arrangements applicable before and after a
discovery.
39.       In the event of a discovery, the permit holder can apply for
a concession, which covers the area where the deposits have been found.
Such concessions are at present valid for 50 years. The revenues to the
Government accrue primarily in the form of a royalty and income taxes
charged to each concession. As the map shows (IBRD Map 14455), the entire
offshore of Congo within the 200 m depth limit is now covered by permits;
the three offshore concessions (Emeraude, Likouala and Loango) belong to
Elf Congo and Agip Recherches Congo, and result from discoveries these two
companies made on their Pointe Noire Grands Fonds and Madingo permits.
Present Status of Oil Exploration
40.       The recent exploration effort started when the predecessor of
what is now Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine (SNEA) of France and Agip of
Italy each applied for permits in 1968. They then created local subsidiaries,
Elf Congo and Agip Recherches Congo (ARC) in which the Government has a 20
percent equity share.l/ Elf Congo took the offshore Pointe Noire Grands
Fonds permit and later the onshore Loeme permit (1973) while ARC took the
offshore Madingo permit. Subsequently, following a then current practice
of risk sharing, Elf Congo and ARC took shares in each other's offshore
permits, Elf Congo remaining the operator of the Pointe Noire Grands Fonds
permit, and ARC of the Madingo permit. These efforts resulted in the
discoveries of Emeraude (Elf Congo - 1969), Loango (ARC - 1971) and Likouala
(Elf Congo - 1973), on which the two companies took concessions. Emeraude
started to produce in 1972 and Loango in 1977 and production is expected to
start on Likouala mid-1980. The infrastructure of each field consists of
well platforms, processing platforms, and a gathering network, together
with crude oil pipelines, to a terminal at the coast (Djeno) which is owned
jointly by the two companies. Several other companies hold offshore
permits but so far have made no discovery. It may be noted in this context
that the SEAGAP companies (Agip, Getty, Hispanoil, Phillips) drilled,
without success, one well during 1978 in a water depth of 1,325 m, a record
water depth at that time.. The Government is currently negotiating an
exploration permit (Kayes-onshore) with several oil companies.
41.       While discovery and subsequent development of its petroleum
resources had a major impact on the Congolese economy, results fell short
of expectations: (i) in the case of Emeraude, one of the largest fields
1/   The agreements also provide that, should production of each company
reach 10 to 20 millLon tons per annum, the Government's equity sharc will
be increased to 30 ipercent.



- 12 -
discovered in Africa, the recovery ratio 1/ turned out to be 3 percent
(against 10 percent - 30 percent in most cases) because of unfavorable
features in its six reservoirs, and the low viscosity of the oil; and (ii)
in the case of Loango, substantial cost overruns were incurred in its
development as a consequence of unexpected rock problems which necessitated
the use of new technology (gravity platforms) and of the need to initiate
secondary recovery at the outset.
42.       These disappointments contributed to growing strains in the
relations between the oil companies and the Government, culminating in 1975
when royalty rates and taxes were increased by the Government in an effort
to increase sagging revenues. Both Elf Congo and ARC reacted by stopping
all exploration efforts. At end-1977, an agreement was reached on acceptable
levels of royalties and taxes. The agreements reached also provided tax
incentives to the companies to accelerate exploration by lowering taxes on
petroleum produced from fields discovered after November 1977 but before
December 1980. As a consequence exploration activities were resumed. One
major and two minor discoveries have been made since, and the companies are
in the process of applying for further production concessions.
Role of the Bank Group
43.       Acceleration of the oil exploration effort in the country is
an important objective of the Government, and it is the Government's
intention to pursue this policy in partnership with private enterprises.
However, the Government recognizes that it does not have at this time the
technical and financial expertise to carry on a meaningful dialogue with
the oil companies currently exploring and producing or with companies which
may be interested in other provinces than those currently under contract.
This renders the partnership unstable and open to misunderstandings and
distrust. To strengthen the Government, some assistance was obtained under
UNDP financing until 1976 and ad hoc advice has been sought from private
sources since.  However, this falls short of what would be required for the
Government in general and the Ministry of Mines and Energy in particular to
fulfill its functions adequately. The Government made a request to the
Bank to help strengthen its capability in the petroleum sector, particularly
in two major areas: (i) in helping to identify the needs for technical
assistance to the Ministry of Mines and Energy and HYDROCONGO, so that they
could play a meaningful and constructive role in the identification and
development of the country's hydrocarbon potential; and (ii) in helping to
match foreign investments with an enhanced data base and institutional
improvements. The Government also requested Bank Group participation in a
direct effort to accelerate exploration; Elf is currently holding discussions
with IFC to explore the possibilities of such an intervention.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Introduction
44.        The proposed project was identified during the visit of a Bank
mission to the Congo in October 1978 and it was appraised in June 1979.
Negotiations were held in Washington on November 16, 1979, and the Congo-
lese delegation was lead by Mr. R. Adada, Minister of Mines and Energy. Key
events and special conditions are presented in Annex III. No Staff Appraisal
Report has been prepared.
Project Objectives
45.        The objectives of the proposed project are:  (i) to strengthen
the capacity of the Ministry of Mines and Energy to supervise exploration and
development of petroleum resources and distribution of products; (ii) to
strengthen the capability of HYDROCONGO to handle efficiently its oil import
and distribution functions and its interests in oil exploration ventures with
foreign partners; (iii) to review the possibility of increased recovery from
the Emeraude field; (iv) 1:o carry out preliminary studies on areas where no
exploration has taken place so far; and (v) to carry out additional related
studies as required.
Project Description
46.        The proposed project would contain the following components:
(a) Assistance to the Ministry of Mines and Energy
In order to strengthen the Ministry's capability to (i) nego-
tiate new esxploration ventures; (ii) supervise their imple-
mnentation; (iii) review and analyze technical and financial
data submitLted by oil companies; and (iv) establish appropriate
policies in the sector, it is proposed to finance a petroleum
geologist, a financial expert, and a petroleum engineer, each
for a two-year period. As required, they would also assist
HYDROCONGO under (b) below.  Local counterparts would be
assigned to each expatriate. In addition the services of a
legal expe,rt would be sought from other sources of financing,
who would 'be attached to the Minister of Mines and Energy
himself. The Ministry of Mines and Energy also attaches con-
siderable importance to the restructuring and strengthening
of HYDROCOiNGO. In consultation with the Association, the
Ministry invited proposals from management consulting firms
to (i) review and make appropriate recommendations regarding
the respec tive roles of the Ministry and HYDROCONGO in the
petroleum sector; (ii) carry out a diagnostic study of HYDRO-
CONGO aimed at identifying existing deficiencies and require-
ments for external assistance; and (iii) prepare terms of



- 14 -
reference for the implementation phase. HYDROCONGO fully
supports this move, since it is aware of inadequacies in
managements methods and systems (para 37).
(b) Assistance to HYDROCONGO
On the basis of the likely conclusions of the diagnostic
study referred to above, it is proposed to finance experts
for HYDROCONGO and training programs, both in the Congo and
abroad. The amounts reserved for this component are deemed
adequate to establish the managerial and technical viability
of the company although further assistance may be required
after project completion.
(c) Special Studies
(i) No exploration has been carried out so far on the
Congo's interior sedimentary basin known as the "Cuvette"
because, until recently, it was not considered attractive
for petroleum exploration; the remoteness and difficulty
of access to the area represented additional impediments.
The Government considers, and the Association agrees,
that it would be worthwhile to carry out investigations
on a limited scale to gather data and use them to
attract oil companies to apply for permits. Following
a review of available data, and of the various feasible
alternatives, the Government proposed, and the Association
has agreed that an airmagnetometric survey constitutes
the best course of action. A possible outcome of this
survey could be a report which would be sold to oil
companies. Any proceeds generated from such sale would
be used, in consultation with the Association, for
activities related to the petroleum sector (see Section
3.03 of the draft Development Credit Agreement). The
amount reserved for this component is based on recent
quotations and is considered adequate.
(ii) As mentioned earlier, the original production of the
Emeraude field has fallen short of expectations. In
view of the considerable size of the known oil in place
(500-800 million tons) and the low recovery ratio (3
percent), the Government wishes to appoint independent
experts to review engineering data (reservoir and
production) and the programs of Elf Congo to enhance
oil recovery. These experts could also propose the
implementation of a pilot test. A report would be
submitted to the Government which would then have
discussions with Elf Congo. Elf Congo is agreeable to
this proposal and has promised to cooperate fully with
the experts appointed by the Government.



- 15 -
(d) Other Stuldies
A provisiLon is proposed for studies related to the petroleum
sector which have not been identified as yet; their purpose
would be to strengthen the Ministry, particularly in negotia-
tions with oil companies, and in the monitoring of their
activities. Such studies will be carried out under terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Association by consultants
selected in accordance with IDA guidelines. (Section 3.02
(a) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Cost Estimate
47.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$5.6 million equiva-
lent, excluding duties and taxes from which the project is exempted. The
foreign cost component is estimated at about US$5 million. The cost of one
expert-year has been estimated at US$110,000 (at 1980 prices), including
overhead costs; this amount is reasonable, taking into account the high level
of specialized expertise required and salaries prevailing in the petroleum
industry.
48.       The proposed 1DA credit would finance the entire foreign exchange
component amounting to a total of US$5 million. The local cost component
would be financed by the Government and HYDROCONGO. Salaries of counterpart
staff have not been inc:Luded as such counterparts would be selected from among
existing staffs of the Ministry of Mines and Energy and HYDROCONGO.
Specialized Services and Disbursement
49.       The selection of consultants would be carried out in accordance
with the Association's guidelines for use of consultants. Regarding special-
ized technical services (airmagnetometric survey of the Cuvette), it is
proposed to obtain three quotations only as the contracts would be relatively
small. Disbursements wiLl be made against 100 percent of foreign expenditures.
Project Implementation
50.       The Ministry of Mines and Energy would be in charge of the
implementation of the whole project. The appointment of the experts who
would assist the Ministry will take place in early 1980. With respect to
the management consultants, A.D. Little (U.S.) has been selected to implement
the first phase. The contract is expected to be signed in January 1980.
The second phase would also be implemented by management consultants
provided that the Government and the Association are satisfied with the
scope and nature of the recommendations of the initial study (see para. 46
(a) above). To finance the experts for HYDROCONGO, and the implementation
of training programs, tihe proceeds of the credit for this component would
be onlent to HYDROCONGO at 10 percent interest over 10 years, including a
3-year grace period. A review of HYDROCONGO's financial situation indicates
that the onlending of the proceeds of the IDA credit would have only a
marginal impact on HYDROCONGO's finances; it would represent less than 6



- 16 -
percent of HYDROCONGO's long-term debt and less than 2 percent of its total
assets. The conclusion of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between HYDROCONGO
and the Ministry of Mines and Energy would be a condition for disbursement
of this component (see Schedule I of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
51.       The project would assist the Government in its efforts to strengthen
the institutions in the petroleum sector. The availability of national
expertise in petroleum matters, which at present barely exists, would help
stabilize relations with the oil companies currently active in the Congo
and would provide the Government with the technical data to enable it to
negotiate more advantageous terms in new contracts. Improvement of
Government relations with oil companies should therefore stimulate invest-
ment and help maximize benefits derived by the Congo from its existing
resources. The project does not face any special risk.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's
Republic of the Congo and the Association, and the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article V Section I (d) of the Articles of
Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
53.       Features of special interest are referred to in Section III of
Annex III of this report.
54.       I am satisfied that the proposed IDA credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
55.       I recommend the Executive Directors approve the proposed Develop-
ment Credit Agreement.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Ln. No._1349   Second Education Project:  US$8 million Loan of May 5,
1977; Effective Date: November 29, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
The project provides for strengthening of educational planning
and creation of a primary teacher college, an education publications unit,
a technical teacher training department and a forestry school. The project
is about 2 years behind schedule due to political and administrative
reorganization and consequent changes in personnel, delays in the architec-
tural design program and contract awards. Outstanding issues concern the
construction contract awards for two institutions and the inactment of key
legislation. Work is progressing on the educational planning component.
Construction has started on the primary teacher training college and the
forestry school.
Cr. No. 435    Livestock Project:  US$5.6 million Credit of November 2, 1973;
EffectiVE Date: April 11, 1974; Closing Date: _December 31,
1981
The project is designed to increase beef output and surplus beeeding
cattle and to provide training and applied research. Herd development is
still a problem although 300 head of breeding stock were recently purchased
from Zaire and another contract for the supply of a further 350 head has been
signed with Zaire. The target for the herd size to be achieved under the
project has been revised downward to 10,000 head. Revenue from sales will be
lower than anticipated and, on the basis of revised projections, will not
exceed operating costs until 1983. Nevertheless, long-term viability can be
achieved by renewed emphasis on livestock purchase and by continuing purchase
beyond the original project period (1980 onwards). Considerable progress had
been achieved on the training and research components and in establishing a
ranching system suitable to the country. The building program still has to be
completed and the project manager is considering the building contract and
completing this component with its own staff. Only limited action has been
taken on reducing operating costs due mainly to labor union pressure on the
wage bill. Since IDA financing for this category has ceased, following
exhaustion of resources for this category, Government has replaced this
financing with a budget contribution. A potential problem will be supplying a
replacement for the expatriate veterinarian position which was recently
vacated.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action taken to remedy
them.  They should be rcad in this  iease, and wiLL the uLLderstanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 1228   Second Railway Project:  US$38 million Loan of April 12, 1976;
Effective Date: November 22, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
1980
The project covers ATC's 1974-78 Investment Plan of which the
major component is the realignment of 88 km of the CFCO railway. After an
initial setback caused by a guerilla attack on the construction site, work
was resumed in December 1977 and progressed swiftly during the very favor-
able rainy season of 1977-78. The attack on the work site caused a first
project cost overrun, including physical and price contingencies from
US$149 million to US$169 million which was financed by the co-donors
(excluding the Bank). However, grave technical problems were encountered
in 1978-79 both in the tunnels, due to major geological faults, and on the
earthworks where slope instability in the deep cuts will result in additional
volumes and, in some cases, will lead to major changes in the alignment of
the new railway section.   Geological investigations to solve the above-men-
tioned problems are still underway and may result in an increase in the
total cost of the realignment works of the order of magnitude of US$150
million. With the assistance of independent consultants appointed in
accordance with the recommendations made by the co-donors at the Brussels
meeting, ATC has the situation now under control and it should be possible
to complete the works by November 1981 or about two years behind schedule.
Final cost estimates through completion of the project based on a complete
set of engineering data are now expected to be available in March 1980 when
a new financing plan will need to be set up. The Government is also
addressing the problem of financing its arrears to the project through
loans from France secured by prospective increased oil production which
will also help shore up ATC's critical financial position. The Bank is
pursuing an intensive dialogue with the Government to improve forestry
policies and stimulate development in this sector which is basic to the
viability of the project.
