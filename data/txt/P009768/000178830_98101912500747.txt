FARAKKA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
I. THE POWER SECTOR
Background
1.01      Economic growth and improvement of the standard of living in India
depend critically on the development of the power sector. In the present
stage of economic development, the demand for power grows roughly twice as
fast as the economy. Because the power industry is relatively capital inten-
sive, its share in total fixed asset formation is increasing rapidly: the
power sector, which has made great strides in the last two decades, is today
the largest economic sector in the country in terms of investment. The sheer
size and increasing complexity of India's power sector, as well as economic
considerations, necessitate an approach to system planning which, to a much
larger extent than in the past, should concentrate on nationwide power devel-
opment and aim at making use of economies of scale through construction of
larger, more efficient power stations and interconnected high voltage trans-
mission systems.
1.02      The strategy of the Government of India (GOI) is to intensify cen-
tralized planning of generation and high voltage transmission with a view to
ultimately centralize control through a national grid with the operation of
generating plant on a merit order basis. To this end, GOI established in 1975
two power generating companies, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC)
and the National Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC) to construct and operate large
thermal and hydro power stations and associated transmission. Consultants have
been engaged to assist the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) in undertaking
a 400 kV system study to determine the configuration and parameters of the
future interconnected national power system. GOI also decided to proceed
with the construction of four large thermal power stations of 1,100 MW to
2,100 MW capacity located at coal fields and supplying bulk power to the
States via an interconnected 400 kV transmission system. Construction of
three such developments, the 2,000 MW Singrauli, the 2,100 MW Korba and
the 2,100 MW Ramagundam projects, has been started with IDA/Bank financial
assistance, each project consisting initially of 600 MW of generating plant
and transmission (Credits 685-IN Singrauli, 793-IN Korba, 874-IN and Loan
1648-IN Ramagundam). An IDA credit of US$300 million has recently been
approved for the second stage of Singrauli, comprising two additional 200 MW
units and two 500 MW units. NTPC's fourth large thermal power plant is the
1,100 MW Farakka plant, located in the Eastern part of the country about 250
kms north of Calcutta. The first stage of this power plant, comprising three
units of 200 MW each, is the subject of this report. Bank Group finance of
US$250 million is proposed comprising a loan of US$25 million and a credit
of US$225 million.
Energy Resources
1.03      India's main commercial energy resources are coal, oil, natural
gas and hydro power. There are also resources of nuclear fuels, principally
uranium and thorium, and India's power program includes the construction of



-2-
further "CANDU" type heavy water reactors using domestically produced natural
uranium as fuel. Two nuclear power stations have been constructed to date
and a third is under construction. Some geothermal energy sites have also
been identified, but the potential appears to be limited.
1.04      coal is by far the most extensive indigenous fossil fuel; reserves
are estimated at 83 billion tons of which some 21 billion tons have been
proven. Additionally, total reserves of lignite at the Neyveli field in Tamil
Nadu are estimated at around 2 billion tons. If low quality coal, e.g., coal
with high ash and moisture content, is excluded, the estimate of commercially
usable coal and lignite is reduced to approximately 24 billion tons which,
on a forecast countrywide usage, would be adequate for about 50 years under
current assumptions of economic growth.
1.05      By comparison with coal, proven reserves of oil are small.  However,
oil and gas exploration programs continue. Exploration and drilling activities
to date have already proven an estimated 230 million tons on shore, and recent
off-shore discoveries west of Bombay in the Arabian Sea have led to delinea-
tion of fields with proven recoverable reserves of about 250 million tons of
crude oil and 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Other reserves of
natural gas, which are found in India both alone and in association with
crude oil, are estimated at over 100 billion cubic meters.
1.06      The potential of hydroelectric power resources is estimated at
70,000 MW of which some 11,000 MW has already been developed. A further
4,700 MW is scheduled for commissioning by FY1984 (see Table 1.2) and some
23,000 MW is currently under investigation or scheduled for investigation.
Some 70% of the total potential is in the Northern and Northeastern regions.
Greater emphasis on hydro-power investments is planned.
1.07      Oil and natural gas have important alternative uses and it is un-
likely that they will be a significant factor in the generation of electric
power. The Government intends, therefore, to base the development of generat-
ing facilities for the foreseeable future on coal or lignite burning thermal
stations and hydroelectric power stations and to gradually develop a small
nuclear program.
Past Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.08      The Bank has made nine loans to India for power projects amounting
to US$334.5 million and IDA thirteen credits totalling US$1,471 million. Of
this amount US$1,170.5 million involves financing of generating plant; US$23
million the purchase of construction equipment for the Beas hydroelectric
project; US$380 million the provision of high voltage transmission; and
US$232 million the purchase of rural electrification equipment. Nine loans
and credits for generating plant, the Beas project (Credit 89-IN) and the
first three transmission projects (Loan 416-IN Credits 242-IN and 377-IN)
have been completed. The Fourth Transmission Project (Credit 604-IN) is
nearing completion and the whole credit amount of US$150 million has been
committed. The third Trombay Thermal Power Project (Loan 1549-IN) was
approved in April 1978. The Ramagundam Thermal Power Project (Credit 874-IN
and Loan 1648-IN) and the Second Rural Electrification Project (Credit 911-IN)



are still in the preliminary implementation stage. The credit for the
Second Singrauli Thermal Power Project (Credit 1027-IN) was approved in
May 1980. Commitments to April 30, 1980 totalled some US$500 million
on the four thermal power plant projects (Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam
and Trombay) and US$150 million on the two Rural Electrification Projects
(Credits 572-IN and 911-IN).
1.09      The Singrauli, Korba and Trombay projects are on schedule.  The
Ramagundam project, the Fourth Power Transmission Project and the First
Rural Electrification Project are proceeding satisfactorily notwithstanding
initial delays in implementation and the substantial delay in preparation
of specifications and review of tenders for the more sophisticated load dis-
patch equipment in the case of the transmission project.
Sector Institutions
1.10      The principal agencies in the industry are:  (i) the State Elec-
tricity Boards (SEBs); (ii) the Atomic Energy Commission; (iii) the Central
Electricity Authority (CEA); (iv) Regional Electricity Boards; (v) the two
central power corporations (NTPC and NHPC); and (vi) the Rural Electrification
Corporation Ltd (REC).
1.11      The SEBs are constituted by the State Governments under the provi-
sions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, to promote the coordinated
development of the generation, supply and distribution of electricity within
their respective States in the most efficient and economical manner, and for
the control and regulation of other supply undertakings which are private
licensees. These comprise municipal utilities such as Bombay Suburban Elec-
tric Supply Undertaking, and private utilities, the largest of which are the
Tata Electric Companies, (Bombay), the Calcutta Electric Supply Company (CESC),
and the Ahmedabad Electric Supply Company. At the present time, the States
effectively own or control well over 90% of electricity supply facilities.
While the SEBs are corporate entities in their own right and enjoy some
autonomy in the management of their day-to-day operations, they are under
the control of their State Governments in such matters as policy, capital
investment, tariff changes, borrowings, pay scales and personnel policies.
1.12      The CEA was formally created in 1950 with responsibility for devel-
oping a national policy for power development and coordinating the activities
of the various planning agencies involved in electricity supply. At that
time, it came under the Power Wing of the Central Water and Power Commission
(CWPC). As a result of administrative changes introduced in October 1974,
responsibility for power was transferred to the Ministry of Energy, which was
created at that time to bring together ministerial responsibility for coal and
power. This involved the transfer of the Power Wing of the former CWPC to the
CEA, which now comes under the Department of Power of the Ministry of Energy
and is responsible for developing a sound national policy for the electricity
supply industry. The Department of Atomic Energy, which is directly responsi-
ble to the Prime Minister, deals with nuclear power generation.
1.13      CEA's powers were enlarged through amendments to the general
provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, which were enacted on



-4 -
November 30, 1976. In addition to its general responsibilities for national
power policies, it is now responsible for the formulation and coordination
of plans for power development, optimization of investments in the power
sector for the whole country, development of interconnected system operation,
training of personnel and research and development. It includes specialist
engineering organizations which provide comprehensive project engineering
services to the electricity supply industry. The Thermal Department also
takes responsibility for monitoring the performance and maintenance records
of thermal power stations and for organizing the training of power station
personnel. The Economic and Commercial Department accumulates data on econo-
mic, finance and accounting aspects of the power industry in India, both at
Center and State levels, with particular reference to the operations of the
SEBs. The emerging role of CEA in financial affairs is evidenced by the
conveying of statutory authority 1/ on it to formulate, in conjunction with
GOI, policy for the accounting treatment of depreciation of fixed assets
in the power sector in India. CEA is also playing a leading role in advising
State Governments on the measures to be taken to implement the amendments
to the financial provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, and is
also providing information to the various working panels of the Rajadhyaksha
Committee (para 1.42). A recent major achievement for the CEA was the adop-
tion by the SEBs of a uniform system of commercial accounting, devised by it
over a period of time. This system, which applies to all SEB accounts from
April 1979, brings uniformity to the procedures relating to the maintenance
of accounts, and, for the first time, enables direct inter-Board comparison
of financial results.
1.14      The SEBs and the other licensed electricity undertakings are required
to submit their investment proposals to the CEA for technical and economic
appraisal and to the Energy Division of the Planning Commission for inclusion
in the Five Year Plan. The Planning Commission is responsible for the alloca-
tion of Plan funds among the States and among sectors. Planning of generation,
transmission, and distribution development has traditionally been undertaken
by each SEB for its own State rather than on a regional or national basis.
However, with the rapid growth of the power sector and with the resultant
increasing complexity of operation, GOI sees the necessity for an integrated
national approach to sector development.
1.15      As a means of improving collaboration between the SEBs and estab-
lishing power systems on a regional rather than a State basis, Regional Elec-
tricity Boards (REBs) have been set up for the Northern, Southern, Eastern and
Western regions. The chairmanship of each REB is assumed in rotation by the
Chairmen of the SEBs within the region and they are staffed by engineers
seconded from their constituent SEBs. The general functions of the REBs are
to plan integrated operation of the power systems in the region for the maximum
benefit of the region as a whole, coordinate overhaul and maintenance programs,
determine generation schedules to be followed and the power available for
transfer between States and determine a suitable tariff structure for the
transfer of power within the region. At present, the Boards function mainly
1/   Amendment of Section 68 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948.



in an advisory role in relation to the SEBs. As mentioned, the REBs were
established between 1964 and 1966 by common resolution of the State and
Central Governments, to help develop integrated power systems in the respec-
tive regions, and thus prepare for the transition from separate power systems
at State level to regional systems and finally to an interconnected national
grid.
1.16      NTPC and NHPC are at present not intended to take a leading role
in the generation and sale of power in the States. At the present time, the
construction of four large central thermal power stations has been started as
mentioned in paragraph 1.02. All of these developments are being constructed
and will be operated by NTPC. NHPC will construct and operate large hydro-
electric projects. A transmission wing has also been established in NHPC to
design and construct the 220 kV and 400 kV overhead transmission associated
with hydro-projects, and any other transmission work which it might be commis-
sioned to undertake. In most States, the SEB will continue for some time to
be the largest power undertaking.
1.17      REC was incorporated in July 1969 under the Indian Companies Act,
1965, as a company wholly owned by GOI, under the general supervision of the
then Ministry of Irrigation and Power (now under the Ministry of Energy).
REC's chief objective is to finance rural electrification schemes throughout
the country, acting as a financial intermediary with technical expertise,
and administering funds received primarily from GOI. It is REC's function
to ensure efficient allocation of these funds by establishing policies,
procedures, and criteria for the formulation, approval and implementation
of such schemes. In doing so, REC is directed to adopt a "project approach,"
coordinating electrification with other inputs in rural development in order
to achieve increased agricultural production and overall economic development.
Existing Facilities - All India
1.18      The total installed generating capacity in the whole of India as
of March 31, 1979 was just under 29,000 MW, including about 2,225 MW of non-

1.19      Transmission is at 132 kV and 220 kV and, general'ly, lod ce
are interconnected by 132 kV and 33 kV subtransmission lines. Distribution
voltages are 11 kV and 415/240 V. The supply, in general, is reliable, but
power shortages, especially during the summer months, necessitate shutdowns
and brownouts. System losses have been reduced in recent years but they are
still high accounting for about 20% of units sent out.  This subject is under
examination by the "Committee on Power" (see para 1.42).
Power Supply/Demand Balance - All India
1.20      India's installed power generating capacity increased at an annual
rate of 10.3% during the 1950s and 1960s while gross electricity generation
grew at just under 12% during this 20-year period due to better utilization
of generating capacity. Although local and intermittent shortages occured
during this period, system failures did not present a major problem. However,
by the early 1970s, the supply situation had grown more serious and potential
demand consistently outpaced supply in a number of states. This situation was
due to several factors such as: failure to impleme.at projects in accordance
with planned schedules; inadequate transmission development; operating and
maintenance problems leading to a low plant availability factor of around 72%;
inadequate budget allocations and; the absence of monsoon rains, particularly
during the early 1970s, leading to lower hydro output.
1.21      The shortage situation was most serious in 1974/75 and 1977/78 and
is again extremely serious now, particularly in the Eastern Region. The
estimated deficit of energy throughout India in 1974/75 was about 11,000 GWh
(14.1%); this fell to 8,600 GWh (10.3%) in 1975/76 and to 5,100 GWh (5.8%) in
1976/77, but increased to 15,800 GWh (15.5%) in 1977/78. Data for 1978/79
indicate that the deficit was of the order of 10%.
1.22      Power shortages, particularly in the industrial sector, have affected
the output of the country and the cost in terms of industrial production fore-
gone has been substantial (generally, energy restrictions fall on industry and
there is relatively little loss to the economy on account of power shortages in
either the residential or agricultural sectors). Lost value-added due to lost
industrial production because of power restrictions, could weil be in the
neighborhood of 3% of GDP. 1/
1.23      The growth of the power sector during the last 10 years and the
pattern of consumption during this period is shown in Annex 1. Sales to agri-
culture and irrigation have increased substantially during the 1970s, mainly
because of the rural development programs. Industrial demand as a proportion
of the total demand has declined, and there has been a small but steady increase
in domestic demand. It is expected that this pattern of demand will continue
with a gradual improvement in the annual load factor.

No. 2335-IN, paragraph 68).

Future Development - All India
1.24      The countrywide peak demand in 1977/78 was 15,520 MW.  According
to CEA's estimates, unconstrained demand is expected to be about 20,300 MW in
1979/80, 18,600 MW of which is expected to be met by available plant capacity.
Installed capacity in 1979/80 is expected to reach about 31,900 MW of which
29,700 MW would be utility plant with the balance of 2,200 MW non-utility.
1.25      The development program provides for an expansion of generating
capacity by about 19,000 MW during the five-year period 1979/80-1983/84,
including the nuclear power plants which are scheduled to come into operation,
bringing the total planned installed capacity to 45,000 MW. The additional
capacity scheduled for commissioning during this period is shown in more
detail in Table 1.2. Furthermore, the construction of some 15,000 km of
400 kV transmission lines is planned to enable full integration of the
regional systems and the evacuation of the output from the proposed large
thermal power stations.

1.26      Table 1.3 shows the planned annual installed capacity aggregating
about 45,600 MW in 1983/84, the available capacity, the peak load and the
forecast of energy requirements and availability (not taking into account
diversity). The data referring to the peak load and energy requirement in
1978/79 show that demand was constrained by supply. The estimated unsuppressed
power and energy demand would have been about 10% higher (see para 1.21). The
forecasts of peak load and energy requirements are based upon continuous mon-
itoring of development trends during the preparation of the annual electric
power surveys of India. If the program of generation development can be
achieved on time, the present shortage of energy would be eliminated from
1982/83 on, but there would still be a capacity deficit through the five-year
period due to a low availability factor of generating plants. The peak avail-
ability in India under present operating conditions, is around 60% of installed
capacity. This availability factor is expected to improve gradually as a

result of the development of system interconnection and the improvement of
maintenance practices.

1.27      Table 1.3 also indicates that both peak load and energy requirement
are estimated to grow at an average annual rate of around 10% during the five
year period 1978/79-1983/84. The forecast capacity deficit decreases from
around 10% of the system load in 1979/80 to 4% in 1983/84 and the energy
availability exceeds energy demand by some 3% in 1983/84. These are varia-
tions which are less than the accuracy of any of the forecast data inputs, but
they demonstrate that, if anything, a case could be made for sanctioning more
capacity than presently planned for commissioning during the five-year period
ending 1983/84, particularly since all-India data mask shortages in specific
regions, which may develop due to insufficient interconnection.
Regional Demand and Supply - Eastern Region
1.28      The major Eastern Region supplying authorities are the Bihar State
Electricity Board (BSEB), the West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB), the
Orissa State Electricity Board (OSEB), the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC),
the Calcutta Electricity Supply Corporation (CESC), and Durgapur Products
Limited (DPL). Each of these authorities (publicly owned boards and corpora-
tions with the exception of CESC) has generating facilities and supplies
electricity to final consumers.
1.29      The three SEBs and CESC supply all final consumers of all categories
in their areas of jurisdiction. DVC's supply to final consumers is limited
mainly to industrial consumers in the Damodar Valley. OSEB usually supplies
surplus energy from its hydro generation to BSEB and some to Andhra Pradesh.
Of the total energy flows in the region, about 20% are accounted for by
inter-authority exchanges. Similarly, about one-third of total capacity demand



- 9 -
at peak is made available between authorities (Annex 2). Total energy supplied
(and consumed) in the region in 1978/79 was 12,800 GWh; maximum regional coin-
cident peak demand covered during the same fiscal year was 2,342 MW. This
represents only a minimal increase in terms of energy, and a decrease by almost
100 MW in terms of availability over the previous year. This disappointing
performance is mainly due to significantly lower availability of firm capacity
in West Bengal in spite of an increase in installed capacity, and has led to
restrictions on demand. At present, WBSEB (including CESC) and DVC are the
authorities with the largest available capacity in the region, together
accounting for more than 50% at peak. BSEB and OSEB together account for
about one-third of peak capacity in the region. In 1978/79, the net import
from outside the region was negligible. In effect, the region operates as a
self-contained system.
1.30      In March 1979, 81% of installed regional capacity consisted of
thermal plant, the remainder being hydro. Orissa, with its higher developed
hydroelectric resources, had a thermal capacity of only 18% but the other
SEBs rely almost entirely on thermal plant. The high dependence on thermal
plant makes the region vulnerable to unplanned outages of thermal equipment,
a situation that arose frequently in West Bengal in 1978/79. No change in
this regional pattern is expected to take place in the short term.
1.31      The pattern of electricity consumption in the region shows a pre-
dominance of industrial use accounting for about 70% of total consumption
(about 62% nationwide). Railway traction takes a larger share than nationally.
Overall, therefore, the region is even more industrially oriented than the
Indian average (Annex 3). No major changes in the shares of individual con-
sumer groups are expected in the future.
1.32      During the five years 1975-79, installed capacity in the region
increased by about 4.5% per year to reach 4,750 MW in March 1979. The avail-
able capacity, however, deteriorated in absolute terms during 1977/78 and
1978/79, falling from 55% of installed capacity to about 49%. An increase
in this percentage is expected in coming years, after expected correction of
present difficulties. Energy consumption has been growing at approximately
7.5% per year for the five years up to 1978/79, with particularly high growth
in Bihar and Orissa. West Bengal recorded an annual growth of consumption of
only 4.5% per year, again due to the drop in available energy in the WBSEB
system in recent years (Annex 4).
1.33      By 1983/84, an additional 3,015 MW (increase of 64%) is expected to
be added. About 50% of this increase will be accounted for by WBSEB and CESC
together. Presently available information indicates that a further 1,975 MW
of new capacity has been approved to come onstream between 1984 and 1988, about
30% of this increase being attributable to the proposed project. About 53%
of this increase beyond 1984 will be thermal capacity. The basis for this
capacity extension plan is the demand forecast conducted in the form of the
periodical comprehensive power surveys (Annual Power Surveys-APS) by the CEA,
and amended by deliberations of the Planning Commission, SEBs, and the National
Development Council. At the time of publication of the Tenth APS in 1977, it
was envisaged that about 3,140 MW of an unconstrained potential peak demand



- 10 -
of more than 3,300 MW in 1978/79 would be met. However, preliminary data on
peak availability in 1978/79 indicate that it was only 2,342 MW. The demand
forecasts have been scaled down subsequently by the CEA and the Planning Com-
mission's Working Group: unconstrained potential peak demand in 1983/84 is
now estimated to be about 4,850 MW (a reduction by 10% from the Tenth APS
estimate), 4,463 MW of which is expected to be met by available plant. The
estimated capacity shortfall in the years until 1984 will reach almost 650 MW
in 1981/82, then decrease to about 400 MW in 1984/85. GOI general policy with
respect to this deficit is to resort to demand restrictions rather than to
meet demand by installing thermal capacity with short gestation periods (e.g.
gas turbines).
1.34      Tentative projections of demand beyond 1984/85 indicate a growth
of potential peak demand in the region by about 9% per year to reach an
estimated 7,480 MW by 1988/89. Similarly, the potential energy requirement
is expected to grow by 9% per year to about 43,170 GWh (Annex 5). Expected
resource constraints and possible slippage in project implementation make it
doubtful that these requirements can be met. It is likely, therefore, that
persistent shortages at peak will continue well beyond 1984, even under
conservative assumptions of demand growth.
Future Integrated System Operation
1.35      With the increasing size of the power sector in India and its far-
reaching impact on the country's economy, annual surveys and Five-Year Plans
at the State level have become insufficient as a basis for power development
planning. The larger size of power plants, their consequent longer construc-
tion period--in average six to eight years for thermal plants and eight to
ten years for hydro plants--as well as their gradual interconnection require
a long-range perspective for investment decisions on a regional and national
level.
1.36      Recognizing the need for coordinated power development throughout
the country, provision was made in Credit 604-IN to help finance the cost of
consultants to study the technical, financial and economic aspects of a long-
term national plan for the sector. Such a plan should include, inter alia,
detailed demand forecasts, investigation of power generation schemes to meet
load growth requirements for a 15-20 year period (indicating costs and sequenc-
ing of investments to optimize resources), development of primary grid confi-
gurations, including the 400 kV system study which CEA has started but which
has come to a temporary standstill mainly due to lack of overall planning,
coordination of power plans with plans for other sectors (determining resource
requirements), and recommendations on responsibilities and needed operational
policies at the State, regional and national levels. Such a study is an
essential prerequisite for formulating sound policies for future development
of the sector and GOI has indicated its intention to complete such a study by
April 1982, based on the terms of reference suggested by the Association (see
para 1.47).
1.37      The operation of regional systems, which will be integrated in the
future into a national grid, requires large numbers of personnel who would have
to be trained in the use of sophisticated load dispatch equipment and inter-
connected systems operation. A UNDP project designed to assist CEA in devel-
oping programs for training staff to operate the future load dispatch centers



- 11 -
came to a halt in 1977, primarily because of personnel problems, and lack of
counterpart staff. However, GOI plans to reactivate the project during the
first half of 1980, and is currently finalizing proposals for program imple-
mentation for submission to UNDP. The Association will be kept informed about
the development of the program.
Bank Group's Strategy in the Sector
1.38      The Bank Group's strategy in its involvement in the Indian power
sector, has been one of cooperation with GOI in seeking solutions to the many
difficult and politically sensitive problems which have confronted the Indian
electricity supply industry since Independence. The sensitivity of Center-
State relations, because of concurrent jurisdiction over the electricity
supply industry, has dictated that a policy of persuasion rather than one
of explicit leverage would produce better results.
1.39      The Bank Group's main objectives in the sector are:
(a) assistance in accelerating the installation of gene-
rating and transmission capacity and promoting measures
to improve the operation and maintenance of existing
plant, in order to gradually eliminate the prevailing
power shortages in the country;
(b) assistance in introducing long-range system plan-
ning on a nationwide basis which would assure imple-
mentation of a least-cost power development program;
(c) promotion of appropriate measures with respect to
improving the sector organization and training; and
(d) strengthening of the finances of the institutions
involved in the sector, particularly of the State
Electricity Boards (SEBs), through setting of rate-
of-return targets or levels of self-financing and
advising in designing of appropriate tariff systems.
1.40      Progress'towards achieving the above goals has been hindered by con-
stitutional factors. Under the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948, power supply
is a "concurrent" subject. This means that the responsibility for supplying
electricity is shared between the Central Government and the State Governments,
requiring full agreement between the Center and the States for the implement-
ation of most actions. The States operate, and develop, through their Elec-
tricity Boards, most of the power facilities. The consequence of this arrange-
ment in many instances has been a parochial approach where a national or at
least regional approach would have been more beneficial. On the other hand,
it is debatable whether Central initiative could have been taken much further
in the time available. The radical proposal that would have enabled power
system generation and bulk supply to be exclusively a Central responsibility,
would have meant a considerable upheaval and would have raised fundamental
political and constitutional issues going well beyond efficiency considerations.



- 12 -
1.41      Given these difficulties, results achieved so far have been
encouraging. They are the following:
(a)  with the establishment of the Regional Electricity Boards
(REBs, para 1.15) and later of NTPC and NHPC, the first
important steps towards an improved organizational structure
of the power sector have been made. GOI intends to gradually
strengthen the authority of the REBs and to increase their
role of coordinating the SEBs in matters of power development
and operations;
(b)   CEA was reorganized and had its powers enlarged through the
amendment in 1976 of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948 (paras
1.12 and 1.13);
(c)  a recent amendment of the financial provisions of the Elec-
tricity (Supply) Act 1948 requires that tariffs be set at
levels sufficient to enable the SEBs to finance a reason-
able proportion of their investment program from internal
sources;
(d)  recently, SEBs in the Eastern Region have been developing
and partially implementing plans designed to improve their
financial performance. These plans consist of tariff
increases, rationalization of manpower requirements and
other cost effective measures;
(e)  with a view to the reassessment of tariff policies, the major-
ity of the SEBs have recently completed tariff studies based
on marginal cost pricing principles. The Bank Group's review
of these studies recommended the standardization of certain
assumptions so as to produce a uniform methodology for general
application by all SEBs. To assist in this standardization
process, CEA is establishing a specialist department to inter-
act with the SEBs and to keep the Bank Group advised of future
developments;
(f)  NTPC's generation/transmission construction program (paras 3.01
and 3.02), which is in the process of staged implementation
with Bank Group assistance, will make an important contribution
to the gradual elimination of the present deficit in the coun-
try's power balance and is planned in the national interest,
a move away from the provincial as was present in the past with
State/SEB operations. The proposed project would help to con-
tinue this program.
1.42      Going beyond these achievements, Indian authorities have recognized
that with the rapidly expanding power sector in the country, all aspects of
the sector have to be reviewed and that satisfactory solutions have to be
found for the various sector problems. Consequently, GOI established a
high-level committee in November 1978, called the "Committee on Power" under



- 13 -
the chairmanship of V.G. Rajadhyaksha, former member of the Planning Comr-
mission.   This committee has been assigned the task to examine and make
recommendations for improvement of the following aspects of the power
sector:
(a) power planning;
(b) project formulation and implementation;
(c) operation and maintenance;
(d) organization and management;
(e) finance, financial management and tariffs;
(f) rural electrification; and
(g) research and development.
Draft reports by the seven expert panels assembled for this purpose have been
completed and have been reviewed by the committee. The committee is expected
to submit its findings to GOI in May 1980. The Bank Group will continue to
take an active interest in the committee's progress.
1.43      There are two specific remaining areas which have been the cause of
concern to the Bank Group and also have been the subject of continuing dia-
logue with GOI. They are:
(a) the weakness of nationwide long-range planning for power
development; and
(b) the weak financial position of some SEBs which, for
instance, have not always been able to achieve the
covenanted rate of return of 9-1/2%.
1.44      The growing recognition by GOI of the high priority which needs
to be accorded to the power sector has been reflected in a rising share of
investment resources being allocated to power generation and transmission
--from 16% of total public sector outlays during the Fourth Plan to 19% in
the Fifth Plan and an estimated 23% tentatively earmarked in the draft
Sixth Plan.
1.45      More realistic planning and improved construction monitoring pro-
moted by CEA has already led to quicker gestation of power projects. During
the Fourth Plan (1969-74) installed capacity rose from 14,300 MW to 18,500
MW, involving a shortfall of some 50% against targets set. By contrast, the
Fifth Plan (1974-78) witnessed an increase from 18,500 MW to 26,000 MW, a
shortfall of only 18% against the target. Standardized layouts and stream-
lined construction procedures have already brought down implementation time
for new thermal projects from an average of 71 months in 1974-75 to 53 months
in 1978-79. Further progress in accelerating the generation program should
result from the installation of larger thermal units (200 MW and 500 MW).



- 14 -
1.46      Better capacity utilization is another major sectoral planning
objective. Poor coal quality has imposed design constraints which are
gradually being mastered. A daily monitoring system has been established by
CEA to monitor generation from 150 major and medium power stations. Measures
are in hand to accelerate the stabilization of newly installed thermal power
units, to better monitor breakdowns, to ensure adequate supplies of spares
and to initiate rehabilitation programs for units which require it. Train-
ing programs at all levels are being strengthened with the assistance of
the Central Electricity Generation Board (UK) and the VGB of West Germany.
1.47      In the continued effort of the Bank Group in dealing with the long-
range problems of the power sector in India, it was decided to concentrate
on the two areas at para 1.43 above. During appraisal of this project and
negotiations for the Second Singrauli Thermal Project discussions were held
with CEA, NTPC and NHPC on the content of a long-range power development study
designed to prepare a least-cost power development program as well as CEA's
capability to undertake such study with its own staff. GOI agreed with the
terms of reference suggested by IDA. The study has been commenced and is to
be completed by April 1982 (para 1.36).
1.48      From a commercial point of view, the financial performance of several
SEBs, the sole customers of NTPC, has been marginal (for detailed explanation
see Annex 6) and even in years where 9-1/2% rates of return were achieved, a
number of SEBs were not able to meet their debt service requirements. 1/ There
are several reasons for this unsatisfactory performance, such as insufficient
generating capacity which does not permit utilization of the market potential
to the fullest extent, less than efficient operating of existing plant, lack
of monsoon rains leading to severe load shedding and blackouts, railroad and
coal mine strikes resulting in insufficient coal supply, and low tariff levels.
Overall, sector institutions have been contributing less than 10% towards
sector investment. Interest bearing loans 2/ from State Governments have up
to now provided about 80% of investment requirements with the balance of funds
coming from outside borrowing sources such as, public subscriptions, REC, ARDC
and LICI.
1.49      In the context of this project, special attention was directed to
the Eastern States, the beneficiaries of Farakka power. The Eastern Region
power sector comprises the States of Bihar, Orissa and West Bengal. It is
characterized by many important and sensitive load centers, involving major
infrastructure industries, such as steel and coal mining. About 40% of the
installed capacity is operated by the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), a
GOI statutory body. Another 10% is operated by a private license (CESC) in
the Calcutta metropolitan area. The balance is shared by the SEBs of the
1/   However, in all States except one, duties are levied on electricity
sales. Including such taxes as a benefit to the States/SEBs increases
the returns by up to 5 percentage points. Furthermore, a recently
enacted GOI tax on kWh generated is also equivalent to a return of
about 2-3 percentage points. The total return in economic terms is
therefore substantially higher than the commercial return to the SEBs.

three States concerned. With State duties and Central excise tax on power
viewed as integral part of power revenues, the rates of return for the public
power agencies of the Eastern Region are estimated at the following levels
(1980): West Bengal, 11.4%; Orissa, 12.1%; Bihar, 4% and DVC, 25.2%. In all
cases, there is scope for improvement in finances of the agencies concerned
through increased generation and sales, reduced auxiliary consumption and
lower transmission losses. There is also scope for more stringent cost con-
trols and more effective management, particularly in Bihar. Recognizing the
need to enhance financial performance of the Eastern Region SEBs, GOI through
CEA held discussions with the State Governments concerned in late 1979 and
agreement was reached about enhanced monitoring and improved accountability
to achieve improved financial management of the SEBs.
II. THE BENEFICIARY - NATIONAL THERMAL POWER CORPORATION LIMITED
Legal Status and Authorities
2.01      NTPC, the beneficiary of the proposed credit was established in
1975 under the Companies Act, 1956. The Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, has
been amended to give the Corporation statutory recognition. NTPC is a company
wholly owned by GOI under the general supervision of the Ministry of Energy.
Its initial authorized share capital of Rs 1,250 million (US$149 million) was
increased in May 1979 to Rs 3,000 (US$357 million). The Corporation has a
Board of Directors which should consist of not less than four and not more
than fifteen, some of whom are part-time. At present there are seven Directors.
2.02      The Companies Act, 1956, confers broad powers on NTPC to carry out
its work. However, the tariffs to be applied as well as any changes in such
tariffs, its investment plans and annual capital budgets, have to be approved
by the Government. NTPC is also subject to periodic examination by the
Committee on Public Undertakings--a body established by GOI to monitor the
performance of public sector enterprises.
2.03      The main objectives for which the Corporation was established are:
(i) to design, construct, and operate large central thermal
power stations and projects; and
(ii) to transmit and sell the power generated.
NTPC will initially own and operate the associated 400 kV transmission system
over which power will be distributed from each plant and sold in bulk to State
Electricity Boards. Later these systems will be part of the 400 kV intercon-
nected regional systems which, still later, will-be integrated into the
national grid.
2.04      NTPC's present program provides for the construction of four thermal
power stations (Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka). It is also possi-
ble that NTPC might ultimately take over the 510 MW Badarpur station near
Delhi (ultimate planned capacity 720 MW). Presently, NTPC is in charge of the
operation of Badarpur on a management fee basis.



- 16 -
Organization and Management
2.05      NTPC's organization which at present is necessarily construction
oriented is shown in Annex 7, page 1. The complete range of management systems
for all disciplines now under formulation are shown in Annex 7, pages 2 and
3. These are based on the philosophies explained in the NTPC publication
"Framework for Project Management" which was first discussed with NTPC during
negotiations for the Ramagundam project and further reviewed by the mission
during appraisal. The organization is adequate.
2.06      NTPC has adopted a two-tier organizational structure:  one at the
central/corporate level and the other for the projects. In addition to normal
corporate level responsibilities, activities such as the development and form-
ulation of policies, and other services relevant to the projects, have been
centralized. These are Technical Services, Contract and Procurement Services,
Quality Assurance and Expediting, and Project Management Services. Other
departments at the central level are Corporate Planning and Marketing,
Corporate Finance, Personnel and Administration.
2.07      The second tier, which embraces project activities, consists of a
project organization for each of the four power plants under construction.
Each project organization is headed by a General Manager who is entrusted
with total responsibility for implementation of all aspects of the project's
construction program.
2.08      Good progress has been made in building up the organization since
1975 when NTPC was established. The Chairman and Managing Director was
appointed in early 1976 and the number of staff appointed by February 29,
1980, was 2,658 comprising 521 executives, 131 executives in training and
2,006 non-executives. These include 17 executives and 35 non-executives
for the Farakka power station. NTPC has also taken over the majority of
the employees of the Badarpur Project and Power Station (see para 2.04).
2.09      Present indications are that NTPC is developing along sound lines.
It has a Chairman and Managing Director who is a competent administrator with
an established reputation in the formation and development of large industrial
undertakings. He has taken a great personal interest in developing a compre-
hensive project management system as well as designing the organization and
procedures, while building up an establishment of highly motivated engineers
and staff. Remarkable progress has been made in all activities in the four
years since his appointment and providing this impetus can be maintained with
no deterioration in management, NTPC should, with the assistance of consultants,
be capable of handling the present large development program. Site organiza-
tions are effectively functioning at the Singrauli, Korba and Ramagundam proj-
ects. The centralized functions which, in addition to the corporate personnel,
are planning and finance, provide the engineering, contracting and project
management input. They are organized to meet the project requirements and
to ensure an effective coordination of the projects under construction.
Training
2.10      NTPC is a young organization which is growing rapidly to meet the
demands of its large construction program. The next phase of expansion will



- 17 -
involve the need to recruit and train operating staff. When all current
developments have been completed and commissioned, NTPC's establishment will
have grown from a present 2,658 to a figure in the neighborhood of 10,000.
The importance, therefore, of implementing training programs for the various
expertises required during the construction and operational phases cannot
be too highly stressed.
2.11      Fortunately, NTPC has placed special importance on this aspect of
its organization, and training programs are being developed by the Corporation
which will, in due course, be backed by a training school equipped with simu-
lators, financed both from the proceeds of Credit 793-IN and from the proposed
loan and credit, and other modern facilities for instructing and training the
operating staff.
2.12      NTPC's training programs which so far have concentrated on pre-
operational spheres of activity such as Planning, Design, Construction and
Management, are now additionally being aimed at its operational sphere. Some
of the current major activities are:
(a) Professional engineering training for Executive Trainees
(Engineering).
(b) Professional engineering training for Supervisory Trainees
(Engineering).
(c) Management development programs.
(d) Seminars and lectures on selected topics.
(e) Familiarization courses for both accounting and managerial
staff on the accounting systems and procedures being imple-
mented by NTPC's consultants.
Recruitment of young executive trainees is mainly from engineering graduates
belonging to mechanical, electrical and civil disciplines on appointment,
who are inducted into a one-year training program. The first group of young
executive trainees was recruited in February 1977, the second in December
1977 and the third by mid-1978 comprising 35, 45 and 84 members respectively.
The fourth group comprising 131 trainees was recruited in 1979 and training
commenced on November 25, 1979. The training programs have been well designed
to provide exposure to power stations under construction and operation, equip-
ment manufacturing plants, engineering descriptions and project management
services. For these purposes, assistance is taken from a large faculty of
experienced engineers and managers selected from all over the country.
2.13      With the first 200 MW generating unit scheduled to commence commer-
cial operation in FY1982, NTPC has finalized comprehensive plans for training
operational staff, particularly the non-supervisory staff in the various tech-
nical and non-technical trades, to provide foremen for the first two units at
Singrauli. The manpower for these is being drawn from experienced staff as
well as from fresh recruitment. Recruitment of manpower has commenced and key
personnel, such as the station superintendent, are already in position.
2.14      On-the-job training has high priority.  The methodology includes
classroom lectures, participation in group exercises and discussions supported



- 18 -
by direct reading, audio-visual presentations and plant visits. Overall
training plans and arrangements at this time are satisfactory.
Sale of Power from the Project
2.15      As in the case of NTPC's other projects being financed with Bank
Group assistance, GOI has undertaken to allocate at least 85% of Farakka's
power to the Eastern Region States, the remaining 15% will be sold in accord-
ance with priorities to be determined by CEA to States with the greatest need.
During negotiations, GOI confirmed that allocation of 85% of the output of
power from the project to the SEBs of Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa and the
DVC had been agreed in principle. Undertakings to this effect from these
organizations would be forwarded to the Bank Group by October 10, 1980.
Accounting Organization and Systems
2.16      NTPC and its management consultants report good progress in the
planning of NTPC's finance and accounting organization (Annex 8) and in the
design and implementation of accounting systems and procedures. The design
of accounting systems for both the construction and operational phases of
NTPC's activities has been completed. Implementation of systems for the
construction phase is either complete or at an advanced stage both at the
corporate center at headquarters, and also at the sites, while the consul-
tants' proposals for the operational phase are at an advanced stage of
discussion with management. To familiarize staff with the systems and
procedures, training courses are being conducted by the consultants in
conjunction with staff members from NTPC's corporate center.
Audit
2.17      The audit of NTPC's accounts and records is undertaken by a profes-
sional auditor appointed by the Company Law Audit Board, on the recommendation
of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. The auditor is normally a
member of the Indian Institute of Chartered Accountants, and his audit report
on NTPC's financial statements is subject to comment by the Auditor General.
The current auditor Messrs. V. K. Mehta and Company, Chartered Accountants,
Delhi, has audited NTPC's accounts since its incorporation and their audit
reports have expressed satisfaction at the state of the company's affairs
during this period. It should be borne in mind that NTPC's activities will
cover only project construction until FY1982 when power will be sold for the
first time. NTPC has already undertaken in connection with previous credits
(and loan) to submit to the Association/Bank audited financial statements
within seven months of the end of the fiscal year to which they relate, to-
gether with a certified report by the auditor, and a review of the accounts
by the Director of Commercial Audits. This has been restated in connection
with the proposed loan and credit.
III. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
3.01      NTPC's present development program comprising the four central
thermal power stations Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka, with asso-
ciated 400 kV transmission, is part of India's power development program



- 19 -
which is described in paragraphs 1.24 through 1.27. The four power plants,
totalling 7,300 MW, have been located at coal fields, since it is more eco-
nomical to transport electricity than coal to the load centers.
3.02      The first stages of the four central power stations consisting in
each case of three 200 MW generating units and associated transmission are
under construction. The commissioning of the power plant units is scheduled
between February 1982 (first 200 MW unit at Singrauli) and July 1989 (last
500 MW unit at Ramagundam).
The Project
3.03      The project represents the first stage of the Farakka development
comprising three 200 MW units with associated transmission totalling about
410 km of 400 kV lines.
3.04      Farakka is NTPC's fourth plant in the series of large thermal
power stations to be constructed by NTPC, to feed into a 400 kV system and
supply bulk power to the SEBs. The present planned capacity of Farakka
is 1,100 MW; however GOI is considering its extension to a final capacity
of 2,100 MW.
3.05      The proposed site of the Farakka power station is in the Murshidabad
District of West Bengal. The station is to be located on the west bank of the
Farakka feeder canal and will utilize coal from the Hurra block of mines of
the Rajmahal coal fields in Bihar.
3.06      The unit size of 200 MW rather than 500 MW was adopted for the first
stage of the power plant so that each unit would represent only about 4% of the
expected peak load in the Eastern Regional grid at the time of commissioning.
A 500 MW unit would represent over 10% and would limit the flexibility of
operation of the power grid. In addition, with the regional 400 kV network
not yet being fully developed by that time, the sudden outage of a 500 MW unit
could create system stability problems. The second stage would be designed
for three 500 MW generating units although only one such unit is planned at
this time.
3.07      The main criteria for site selection were availability of coal and
cooling water. The Hurra basin of the Rajmahal coal fields contains an area
earmarked for open-cast mining with about 340 million tonnes of proven mine-
able coal reserves. The mines would have a productive life of about 85 years,
supplying the amount of coal needed by the power plant with a capacity of
1,100 MW. The present production program for the new mines to supply the
project envisages a build up from 1.1 million tonnes per year in 1983/84 to
4.2 million tonnes per year by 1985/86 and 5 million tonnes from 1986/87
onwards. The mine will be operated by Eastern Coalfields Ltd., GOI's mining
company for the Eastern Region, an experienced company which has developed
and operates a substantial number of other mines. During negotiations GOI
agreed that necessary steps will be taken to ensure adequate coal supplies for
the efficient operation of the project. Coal will be transported from the
Hurra mines some 50 km from the power station by a captive rail transportation
system which is to be installed for this purpose. As in the case of NTPC's



- 20 -
other three power plants under construction, a merry-go-round system would be
constructed, in this case with a total length of 87 km. The rail system will
be owned and operated by NTPC.
3.08      The power station's cooling water requirements would be met from
the Farakka feeder canal where an abundance of water is available. The mini-
mum flow in the canal is estimated at over 25,000 cu. ft./sec, and the esti-
mated requirements of cooling water for the 1,100 MW power station is less
than 8% of the canals minimum flow. The cooling water will be returned to
the canal some 1.5 km below the intake point. The Farakka Barrage Authority
has given gn undertaking, confirmed by the Central Water Commission, to supply
up to 84 m (3,000 cu. ft.)/sec for consumptive use. Availability of water
for the project should therefore present no problems.
3.09      The operation of the Farakka power station will be integrated
with the Eastern Regional System and its power output will be allocated to
the States in the Eastern Region. For the first 600 MW phase the associated
transmission to evacuate power from the power station will comprise 400 kV
single circuit transmission lines between Farakka and Durgapur and Farakka-
and Jeerhat aggregating 410 km. In the second phase, an additional 230 km
of 400 kV line will be added between Farakka and Mokamah.
3.10      The project consists of:
(a) acquisition of land, civil works comprised of roads, cul-
verts and other miscellaneous preliminary works, power
station and residential buildings, plant foundations,
railways, canals, ducts and other works associated with
the circulating water systems;
(b) three 680 tonnes/hour boilers and three 200 MW turbo-
generating units complete with all auxiliaries and
ancillary electrical and mechanical equipment including
the switchyard; and
(c) the 400 kV transmission lines comprising one 165 km single
circuit line from Farakka to Durgapur and one 245 km single
circuit line from Farakka to Jeerhat.
(d) a training simulator.
The project is described in greater detail in Annex 9.
Estimated Cost
3.11      The estimated cost of the project, excluding interest during con-
struction and duties and taxes, is about Rs 4,119 million (US$490 million).
On the assumption that most of the contracts will be won by Indian suppliers,
the direct and indirect foreign currency costs are estimated at about Rs 521
million (US$62 million) and the local currency costs at Rs 3,598 million
(US$428 million). The estimated cost of the project is set out in Annex 10
and summarized in Table 3.1 below:

3.12      The estimates for the main items of equipment are based on the quota-
tions received during 1977 and 1978 for similar types of plant and equipment
for the first stage of the Singrauli, Korba and Ramagundam developments with
prices escalated to 1979 levels. Transmission costs are also based on esti-
mates received for the 400 kV transmission associated with the three power
plants mentioned above and on the costs of 400 kV construction at various
locations in India. Physical contingencies of 10% on civil works, and of 5%
on plant and transmission costs have been allowed to provide for unforeseeable
factors. In assessing price contingencies, it has been assumed that contracts
will be fixed price or with ceilings on price inflation for turbo-generators
and boilers (as was the case of NTPC's three other power plants under con-
struction). Costs for equipment and erection have been escalated at 6% for
1979, 10% for 1980, 7% for the years 1981-1983 and 5% for the years after 1983.
These assumptions have resulted in price contingencies of 37% for civil works,
22% for the turbogenerator and boiler package, 48% for other electrical and
mechanical equipment, 49% for the coal handling and transportation equipment
and 32% for the transmission component.
Project Financing
3.13      The proposed loan and credit aggregating US$250 million, represent-
ing about 51% of the cost of the project (excluding duties and taxes and
interest during construction), would be applied to the CIF and/or ex-factory
costs of plant and equip-, ment. Civil works, plant erection costs, inland
transportation costs, interest during construction, duties and taxes and any
other costs not financed from the credit, aggregating about US$277 million,
would be financed by GOI in the form of loan and equity capital.



- 22 -
Engineering and Construction
3.14      The desirability of obtaining technical advisory services from
consultants was discussed during negotiations and it was agreed that since
the basic designs for the Farakka project would be largely of a repetitive
nature, a retainer consultant satisfactory to the Bank Group, would be
engaged to (i) review deviations from earlier power station designs and
(ii) assist NTPC as necessary in the design of and preparation of speci-
fications for the power station. NTPC will also use sub-consultants as
required. A total of 100 man months at US$10,000 per man month with an
aggregate cost of US$1,000,000 of which US$200,000 would be foreign exchange,
would be provided under the proposed loan and credit.
3.15      NTPC, under its competent chairman, has developed a comprehensive
project management system, including program coordination and supervision
of construction of the power stations. However, in view of the magnitude of
its construction program, NTPC agreed under the Second Singrauli Thermal
Power Project to conclude not later than October 15, 1980 all contractual
arrangements for the engagement of consultants to review its project manage-
ment and information systems and their initial implementation. A similar
covenent to this effect has also been included for this proposed loan and
credit.
Procurement
3.16      Procurement of all equipment to be financed from the proposed loan
and credit, would be on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank Group's guidelines. Documents for individual con-
tracts above US$1,500,000 equivalent (estimated to be at least 95% of the
Credit) would be subject to prior review by the Bank Group. Bidding documents
for equipment, including tender analyses and recommendations for award of con-
tracts, would be prepared by NTPC and approved by the Bank Group. To facilitate
contract coordination, the invitation to tender for major plant contracts would
be on a supply, deliver and erect basis. This could include civil works in
certain cases where these cannot be disassociated from the plant contract--
i.e., coal handling, substation structures, transmission lines, but such civil
works would not be financed from the proposed credit. Local manufacturers
would be expected to bid for all categories of equipment. A domestic pre-
ference of 15% or the import duty, whichever is less, would be applied in bid
comparison for equipment contracts. To prevent administrative procurement
delays, in case the lowest evaluated bidder is a foreign manufacturer, GOI,
as in previous loans and credits, agreed during negotiations that it would
grant import permission for such items without further review by any agency of
the Government. There are competent local contracting firms in India and also
manufacturing facilities covering most of the equipment for the project. All
items not financed from the proposed loan and credit will be subject to local
procurement procedures, which are satisfactory.



- 23 -
Disbursements
3.17      Disbursements from the proposed loan and credit would be made
against 100% of the cost of technical advisory services of the retainer
consultants appointed by NTPC (see para 3.14) the and against cost of the
equipment to be financed from the proposed loan and credit on the following
basis:
(a) 100% of the ex-factory cost of equipment procured in India
after international competitive bidding; and
(b) 100% of the foreign cost of equipment procured from
abroad.
The estimated disbursement schedule is given in Annex 12.
Ecological Aspects
3.18      The Indian National Committee on Environmental Planning and Coordina-
tion of the Department of Science and Technology, has indicated no objection
to the Farakka Project on environmental grounds, and NTPC will comply with
all environmental quality standards prescribed by that committee in the design,
construction and operation of the project. Appropriate action should be taken
during the Farakka design stage to deal with the principal environmental
problems which are:
(a) Location. The proposed Farakka power station is a pit head
station and is situated far from any urban area. Accordingly,
there are no problems other than the need to ensure the health
and environment of the operating staff who will be housed in
a residential area to be constructed some 4 or 5 km from
the power station.
(b) Stack Emission. Electrostatic precipitators with an efficiency
of 99% will be installed to take care of the high ash content
of the coal. The stack will be of such a height as to ensure
that particulate matter is dispersed in the atmosphere to reduce
pollutant fall out concentrations to acceptable levels. The
coal is of low sulfur content (0.3-1.5%) and sulfur dioxide
levels in the gas are within permissable limits.
(c)  Heat Dissipation.  The power station's requirement of cooling
water will be met from the Farakka feeder canal, and will
be returned to the same canal through a discharge channel
to a point about 1.5 km downstream, where a suitable dif-
fusion device will be provided. After leaving the power
house there will be some heat dissipation in the discharge
channel. The maximum temperature rise in the feeder canal
due to the return of cooling water is estimated to be
2-3 C. Water in the canal will gradually return to its
normal temperature as it flows downstream.



- 24 -
(d) Ash Disposal. The ash will be pumped as a slurry, through
a pipeline, to an ash dump area located some 6.5 km from the
power station. Skimmers would be provided to obtain rela-
tively ash free water from the disposal area before going
to natural drainage.
3.19      With regard to the safety and occupational health of employees,
safety regulations for power stations, to which all operating personnel must
conform, will be strictly enforced. The turbine hall of a modern steam tur-
bine power station, which is the noisiest area of the plant, has a sound
pressure level of less than 90 decibels which is well below the maximum
acceptable threshold for the normal 8 hour/day shift worker.
Project Risks
3.20      The project represents one segment of an overall development program
comprised of 7,300 MW of generating plant and some 7,000 km of 400 kV trans-
mission. It is part of a tightly designed program with plant and transmission
coming in at phased intervals throughout the period 1982 through 1989. Main-
taining this program on schedule requires careful coordination and expert
supervision at all levels. The principal risk is the possibility of slippage
which could give rise to delayed commissioning of plant and loss of benefits.
With a program of construction of this magnitude, there is no guarantee that
some delays will not occur, but these should be kept to a minimum through
careful coordination and supervision during construction and careful attention,
when placing contracts, to the capability of manufacturers to meet the delivery
schedules.
3.21      Other risk areas are in engineering design, cost overruns and prob-
lems in commissioning and operation during the early operational stage with
resultant loss of revenues. There is also the risk of damage due to fire,
explosion, etc, but this is covered by insurance provided by the respective
contractors during the construction stage and by GOI through its self-insurance
policy after commissioning.
3.22      These risks have been carefully assessed and the following safe-
guards taken:
(a) NTPC is being assisted by consultants, and this should minimize
problems as regards engineering and design;
(b) Plant and equipment costs are based on similar works currently
in progress in India; provision has been made for cost escala-
tion and there should be little risk of any substantial cost
overrun unless inflation exceeds estimates; and
Cc) a number of 200 MW generating units will have been in opera-
tion for some years before the project is commissioned, thus,
providing experience and trained manpower for the project.

IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
4.01      Financial forecasts of NTPC's annual operations through FY1991
(Annexes 13 through 15) are based on a capital investment program (Annex 14,
page 2) which envisages the construction of four large thermal power stations
with a combined capacity of 7,300 MW, together with almost 7,000 circuit
kilometers of 400 kV transmission lines at a latest estimated cost of Rs 48
billion (US$5,714 million equivalent). The power stations and transmission
lines will be commissioned on a phased basis during the period February 1982
to July 1989.
4.02      Concurrently with this construction program, NTPC is responsible
for the operation and development of the Badarpur power station in Delhi.
This involves directing operations of the 510 MW thermal generating plant
(initially 300 MW plus a 210 MW extension constructed and commissioned by
NTPC), and for construction of a further 210 MW extension already sanctioned
and due for commissioning in September 1981.
Future Earnings
4.03      NTPC will become operational in February 1982 when its first 200 MW
generating unit at Singrauli is expected to be commissioned. Additional gene-
rating capacity scheduled for commercial operation during the succeeding seven
year period, is set out in Annex 16, page 1, paragraph 2(a). NTPC's projected
earnings are based on the assumption that NTPC would supply bulk power at 400
kV to State Electricity Boards at a tariff level which would enable it to earn
a reasonable return on its investment. This was defined in connection with
previous credits and loan as being a tariff level sufficient to produce a rate
of return of not less than 9.5% on the book value of the average net fixed
assets in service in FY1989 1/, and applied from the time of commissioning of
the first generating unit in Singrauli in 1981/82 2/.
4.04      Several changes were necessary in a number of assumptions underlying
NTPC's financial projections, because of: slippage in the commissioning dates
of operating plant, release of GOI funds as equity capital in the earlier years,
followed by loan capital in later years and cost revisions in the overall
investment program. The effects of these changes are to:
(a) increase the bulk selling price by 12% over the level esti-
mated at the Ramagundam appraisal, bringing it to just over
29 paise/kWh;
1/   The first fiscal year in which all generating units at Singrauli were
projected to operate at 5,500 hours a year.
2/   There are no requirements within India either statutorily or for commer-
cial accounting purposes, to note fixed asset and depreciation data at
current price levels. The equivalent in real terms of a 9.5% rate of
return on an historic rate base in FY1989 is about 7.5% (Annex 17).



- 26 -
(b) eliminate losses during the initial years of operation; and
(c) reduce by some 5% the overall cost of the investment program.
4.05      The income statement (Annex 13) shows the projected earnings perfor-
mance for FY1982 through FY1991. Mainly because of a substantially reduced
interest charge, resulting from the revised financing arrangement referred to
in paragraph 4.04, NTPC will become profitable in its first year of commercial
operation, FY1982. Earnings will rise rapidly thereafter, following the rapid
commissioning of plant from FY1984 through FY1989, and will reach the stipu-
lated rate of return of 9.5% in FY1989, rising to 11.4% by FY1991. Internal
resources will generously cover debt service requirements in the initial years
FY1982-FY1986 and adequately thereafter.
4.06      Regulating NTPC's annual earnings is a function imposed on GOI by
the amendment to Section 75A of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948. Under
the amendment, GOI is required to specify the quantum of annual surplus which
should be earned so as to provide from internal resources a reasonable contri-
bution to capital investment, and to pay dividends on the equity capital.
Under present assumptions, NTPC's internal resources would not be adequate
to meet these commitments until FY1988. At the negotiations of the Second
Singrauli Project, GOI confirmed that while NTPC's surplus would be regulated
from the time NTPC became revenue earning (FY1982), the appropriate amount of
surplus would depend, in part, upon NTPC's future investment program at that
time. It was thus premature to specify a surplus at this stage. However,
the 9.5% rate of return would be retained as a minimum requirement in FY1989
and thereafter.
4.07      As in earlier credits and loan, it has been restated for the pro-
posed loan and credit that NTPC would achieve in FY1989 and maintain there-
after a rate of return not less than 9.5% on net fixed assets in operation,
and to set tariffs from the time the first generating unit at Singrauli is
commissioned, at levels not lower than estimated to achieve the required
9.5% rate of return in FY1989.
Taxation
4.08      NTPC is liable for income tax under the Indian Income Tax Acts.
Because of the large capital expenditure program between FY1979 and FY1988
liability to tax will not arise in the foreseeable future and a tax equaliza-
tion reserve is not necessary.
Financing Plan FY1977-FY1986
4.09      The following table sets out the financing plan for the ten-year
period FY1977 through FY1986 (the year during which the project is scheduled
for completion).

4.10      The financing plan covers the proposed project construction period
and provides for construction of the ongoing Singrauli, Korba, and Ramagundam
Projects, the Second Singrauli Project, and the proposed Farakka Project,
together with the balance of the generation and transmission construction
program, discussed at paras 3.01 and 3.02. GOI is expected to request addi-
tional financial assistance for the balance of the program. The cost of the
proposed Farakka Project represents almost 10% of construction expenditures
in the financing plan. GOI would provide the capital required by NTPC in the
form of debt and equity in a ratio not exceeding 1:1.
4.11      The proposed loan and credit aggregating US$250 million would be
relent to NTPC in accordance with an acceptable onlending agreement, as a
condition of effectiveness of both the loan and credit.  As in previous
operations, the terms of the on-lending agreement would provide for final
maturity in 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and repayment of



- 28 -
principal in equal semiannual installments, with interest payable on out-
standing loans at 10.25% per annum. This is the rate of interest at which
GOI currently lends to industrial and commercial undertakings in the public
sector, and compares with about 16% charged by domestic lending institutions
for similar types of lending. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by
the Government. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that GOI will
provide the balance of funds required to complete the project on terms satis-
factory to the Bank Group and to provide any additional funds which might be
required due to cost overruns or other unforeseeable factors.
4.12      Bank Group financing of the proposed Farakka Project, US$250 mil-
lion, together with Bank Group financing of the total Singrauli development
and the first stage developments of the Korba and Ramagundam stations, in
aggregate US$1,150 million, represents some 42% of the total costs involved,
excluding duties, taxes, and interest charged to construction.
Internal Cash Generation
4.13      The Source and Application of Funds Statement presented in Annex
14 shows the rapid buildup of internally generated funds from the time NTPC
becomes revenue earning in February 1982. An unusually high debt service
coverage of 9 times and 6 times in FYs 1982 and 1983, respectively, is caused
by the mainly equity financing in those years. Financing by means of loan
capital in succeeding years reduces the coverage ratio to a more balanced
level reaching 1.3 times in FY1989, when the total Farakka development would
be commissioned.
4.14      The level of internal cash generated is determined by the assump-
tions made in the financial projections (Annex 16). Surplus funds arise in
FY1988 and accelerate rapidly thereafter. It is reasonable to assume that,
having reached a satisfactory level of financial viability, NTPC would be
expected to commence paying dividends on its equity share capital. This
is a decision which will have to be made by GOI in due course, and will be
influenced by decisions on whether or not to expand the activities of NTPC
beyond the current investment program. A decision could also be made to
pay off GOI loans in advance of their maturity, thereby saving interest and
improving NTPC's profit-
ability.
Future Finances
4.15      Forecast condensed balance sheets through FY1991 are presented in
Annex 15. The balance sheets reflect the build-up of the construction pro-
gram, the commencement of commercial operations in February 1982, and the
financing of NTPC's capital requirements by GOI through a combination of
long-term borrowing and equity capital, so as not to exceed a debt/equity
ratio of 1:1, with equity being released initially followed by loan capital
later.   Table 4.2 below shows NTPC's projected financial position at three
significant points in its development:
(a) at March 31, 1982 - end of year when NTPC becomes revenue
earning;



- 29 -
(b)  at March 31, 1986 - end of year following commissioning of
the proposed Farakka Project; and
(c)  at March 31, 1990 - end of year in which the last unit in
the investment program would be commissioned.

4.16      The above table shows that by March 31, 1982, just after the point
at which NTPC becomes revenue earning, total capitalization would be about
Rs 14,000 million (US$1,667 million), with a debt/equity ratio of 2/98. Four
years later - end of FY1986, after the Farakka Project would be commissioned -
total capitalization would have almost tripled to about Rs 42,000 million
(US$5,000 million) with a debt/equity ratio of 45/55. Over 60% of the con-
struction program will have been completed at this time. By March 31, 1990,
when the balance of the construction program would be completed, capitaliza-
tion would be about Rs 47,000 million (US$5,600 million) with an improvement
in the debt/equity ratio to 38/62. The improvement in the debt/equity ratio
between FY1986 and FY1990 reflects the assumed cessation of expansion and its
associated financing, combined with significant increases in the level of
retained earnings, caused by improved profit volume. NTPC's authorized share
capital would be raised progressively during the period FY1980 through FY1984
(Annex 15) to reach a figure of about Rs 22,000 million (US$2,620 million).
It is currently RS 3,000 million (US$357 million).



- 30 -
4.17      The level of working capital in NTPC's balance sheet assumes that
its customers (SEBs) would have credit terms of 30 days. Monthly billings
for energy sold would be running at the rate of almost US$3 million in FY1982.
US$47 million in FY1987 and US$116 million in FY1991. Accordingly, delay
in payment of accounts by SEBs would adversely affect NTPC finances. This
is not regarded by NTPC as a serious problem because, under existing circum-
stances in India, credit terms of less than 30 days for interstate transfers
are common. In addition, penalties for late payment of accounts would be
imposed. Further reference to this subject will be made during dialogue with
GOI and NTPC on the bulk tariff issue (para 4.19).
Borrowing Powers
4.18      The Companies Act 1956 (Section 293.1(d)) restricts borrowing by
NTPC to less than the aggregate of the paid up share capital and the "free
reserves" (i.e., those not set apart for a specific purpose) except with the
consent of the corporation in general meeting. During negotiations NTPC
agreed to inform the Bank Group beforehand of any proposal to alter or modify
existing limitations on the borrowing powers of its Board of Directors.
NTPC's Bulk Tariff
4.19      This is a matter which was first discussed during the appraisal and
negotiation of the First Singrauli Project (Credit 685-IN). Since the first
200 MW unit was not scheduled to come into commercial operation until early
in calendar year 1982, this matter has awaited the formulation by GOI and NTPC
of the strategy for the sale of power from the central thermal power stations.
The dialogue was resumed at negotiations of the Ramagundam Project (Credit
874-IN and Loan 1648-IN) and continued during appraisal and negotiation of
the Second Singrauli and Farakka Projects. Subjects discussed included the
regionalization of the bulk tariff; the form of contract with SEBs and REBs,
covering operating practices, financial requirements, arrangements for settle-
ment of disputes; and the structure of proposed tariff. These matters are
discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs.
Regional Tariffs
4.20      There appears to be a valid case for regionalizing NTPC's bulk
tariff to better reflect the nature of the individual NTPC thermal power
stations as integral parts of regional power systems, at. least until a national
power grid is established. This could be achieved in a manner compatible with
NTPC's tariff covenant with the Bank Group (para 4.07). If the total capital
base at FY1989 was broken down over each of the four stations and operating
costs and revenues for the various years similarly allocated, a bulk tariff
for each station in each region would emerge. This exercise was undertaken
during appraisal and produced the following approximate bulk tariffs:



- 31 -
Paise/kWh 1/
Singrauli (Northern Region)                23
Korba (Western Region)                     31
Ramagundam (Southern Region)               34
Farakka (Eastern Region)                   32
Average (All Regions)                      29
A comparison of the Farakka bulk tariff with bulk exchange tariffs in the
Easter Region is contained in Annex 18.
Commercial Arrangements for Sale of NTPC Power
4.21      NTPC has prepared a draft contract for the sale of power to its
customers in the Northern Region (mostly SEBs). The draft explains the
manner in which power (including NTPC's) would be distributed to individual
customers in the region through the Regional Load Dispatch Centers, the com-
mercial and financial arrangements for the sale of NTPC's power, and the
arrangements for the settlement of disputes. During negotiations of the
Second Singrauli Project, GOI confirmed that NTPC's draft contract was
being examined in the context of a proposal to study the feasibility of a
common agency selling power from all central projects in a region to SEBs
at a common rate, so as to optimize operation of regional systems. The
feasibility and the several technical, operational, commercial and institu-
tional aspects of this proposal needed examination. Once a view had been
taken on the concept of a pooled tariff for central generation in a region,
NTPC's commercial arrangements for the sale of its power would be finalized.
During negotiations, GOI agreed to finalize these arrangements at least
six months before the start of commercial operation of the first Farakka
unit currently scheduled for December 1984. Continuing dialogue would be
maintained with the Bank Group on this subject.
Tariff Level and Marginal Cost
4.22      At the present time, while no output will be sold by NTPC for sev-
eral years to come, it is irrelevant to talk of marginal cost-based tariffs
at 1979 levels. NTPC is not an existing expanding system, but has to be
treated as the beginning of such a supply system. By definition, practically
all costs of the system known in 1979 are future, marginal costs of supplying
incremental demand. In order to arrive at marginal costs in future years when
power is actually sold, assumptions about the future expansion and operation
of the system, and about inflation expectations have to be made (Annex 19).
1/   While interest during construction has been calculated on a "total
company" basis, some inequities may emerge in allocating the interest
to individual stations, due to the fact that loans as distinct from
equity finance may have been allocated to specific plants, on a "first
in-first out" basis, whereas it might be more equitable to allocate
interest on an "average cost of capital basis". The figures above would
require some adjustment if this were the assumption. Nevertheless they
are useful for purposes of illustration.



- 32 -
4.23      Assuming that capacity expansion investment will continue for the
foreseeable future in line with growing demand, and that, ultimately, NTPC
will be operating at the limit of its capacity, the estimates of marginal-cost-
based tariffs for 1984/85, the first year of operation of all four stations
range from 35 to 37 paise/kWh (US44.2-4.4) as a one-part tariff, and Rs 935-
1,022/kW/year (US$111-122) plus 9.1-11.2 paise/kWh (USJ1.1-1.3) as a two-part
tariff (Annex 19). The discrepancy between these figures and the financially
determined tariff levels (para 4.20) is, of course, attributable to the fact
that present financial projections are based on investment tapering off in
the later years, while the marginal cost concept allocates full marginal cost
of additional capacity to incremental demand if this demand occurs at full
capacity utilization.
4.24      Notwithstanding the limitations of the marginal cost approach, it
will be necessary to consider it as an input into tariff construction in later
years, when marginal cost will start exceeding the financial tariff that is
planned to remain fixed in absolute terms throughout the projection period.
Any intention to expand NTPC operations after the late 1980's or an integra-
tion of NTPC capacity into a future national generating authority will have
to take into account the need to provide for future investment and to post
proper price signals to SEBs and consumers.
4.25      The Bank Group has been encouraging SEBs to carry out marginal cost
based tariff studies aimed at establishing tariff levels based on economic
considerations. Ten major SEBs have so far completed their studies while a
further three SEBs are expected to complete their studies shortly. During
negotiations the Bank Group received an undertaking from Orissa SEB to carry
out a similar study which would be completed by May 1981.
V. JUSTIFICATION

available to meet part of forecast demand in the Eastern Region within the
foreseeable future.

5.02      Given the existing and forecast power shortages in the Eastern
region, the need for additional capacity is urgent. Capacity of the required
amount can only be provided by thermal plant with a sufficiently short gesta-
tion period. Possible hydro sites require extensive engineering studies,
and those hydro projects that can be constructed within a reasonable time
will be undertaken as parts of concurrent SEB investment plans. The nuclear
alternative was excluded because of the long gestation period.
1/   For purposes of justification, the project is defined as the full
Farakka program at time of appraisal of 1,100 MW generating capacity,
thus properly allocating all initial infrastructure expenditure to the
total final capacity.



- 33 -
5.03      Although the theoretically most attractive solution to provide
thermal capacity quickly might be the expansion of existing coal-fired gener-
ating stations, the expansion potential of existing stations in the region is
limited and sufficient capacity could not be brought on stream by using this
hypothetical solution. The only realistic alternatives are, therefore, either
the proposed project (a coal-fired station near the pithead supplying the whole
region), or a series of smaller stations near load centers that would be the
natural choice of the SEBs in the absence of a large centrally operated
project.
5.04      The alternative consisting of smaller stations at the load centers
might encompass three new sites (in Orissa, Northern Bihar and near Calcutta)
and the expansion of an existing station in the Damodar Valley area with an
aggregate capacity equal to that of the proposed project. With the exception
of the Orissa site, all locations would require transport of coal over sub-
stantial distances. The largest station (420 MW) would supply Calcutta, and
the second largest (330 MW), Northern Bihar load centers (Annex 20).
5.05      As the transmission facilities included in the proposed project are
designed to serve not only for the evacuation of Farakka power, but also for
other energy flows in the region, an allowance for some additional transmis-
sion investment has been made in the cost of the alternative solution. This
includes not only the transmission necessary for the evacuation of power from
the Orissa pithead station, but also the "regional" element (Annex 21).
5.06      The costs of both the project and its alternative have been phased
to provide capacity and energy in the same pattern (Annex 22). All costs are
expressed in economic terms, i.e. in CIF/FOB prices where available and ad-
justed by the appropriate conversion factors to border prices where necessary.
Unskilled labor has been shadow priced at 75% of the market wage, skilled
labor at full market wage. The economic cost of coal has been derived from
production cost expressed in border prices (Annexes 23 and 24).
5.07      The project constitutes the least cost solution for satisfying
1,100 MW of demand in the Eastern Region gradually from 1985 onwards. Annex
25 shows the present values of the cost streams of the project and of the
alternative assuming opportunity cost at capital at 10%, with a sensitivity
test at a discount rate of 13%. The results show the advantage of the project
over its alternative of Rs 633 million (US$75 million) at the 10% discount
rate, and Rs 443 million (US$53 million) at the 13% discount rate. The proj-
ect is more attractive than the alternative at discount rates up to about 35%.
The cost advantage of the project rises with higher fuel cost and is slightly
less if the cost of capital goods increases.
Benefits
5.08      Quantification of economic benefits arising from the implementation
of an expansion of generating plant integrated into a existing and growing
system is not easily established. A two-stage approximation approach has
been adopted for the proposed project: (a) average retail tariffs in the
region have been assumed to represent a proxy for the minimum observed will-
ingness of consumers to pay for power; and (b) in order to quantify some addi-
tional consumer surplus beyond this minimum, the cost incurred by industry



- 34-
in maintaining and operating standby generating sets has been assumed to
represent a proxy for industrial consumers' willingness to pay for continuo-ss
power supply (Annex 26).
5.09      Corresponding to the definition of benefits as willingness to pay
at the retail level, additional costs of transmission and distribution invest-
ment as well as for operation and maintenance have been allocated to project
cost in line with the general regional incremental investment pattern. This
additional cost is net of the transmission element already included in the
project cost. The incremental amount of energy sold has been adjusted to
account for system losses typical for the region (Annex 21).
5.10      The weighted average of tariff revenue at retail level in the East-
ern Region has been established at 27.8 paise/kWh in 1979 prices, and converted
to border prices for purposes of the comparison with economic cost.  The indus-
trial tariff revenue is replaced by the observed average willingness to pay for
continuous power supply 1/. The minimum economic internal rate of return
quantified in this way is 13%, increasing to 15% if more frequent outages occur,
resulting in a higher utilization of standby sets.
5.11      The internal economic rate of return is likely to be considerably
higher than the minimum quantifiable estimate of 13%, if the derived consumers'
and producers' surplus of industrial, agricultural and commercial output made
possible by the alleviation of shortages is taken into account, and if indirect
benefits accruing to the Indian economy would be fully considered. Benefits
accruing to domestic consumers are also understated by the use of the tariff
as benefit. Were retail tariffs alone used as the proxy for benefits, it
would be noted that tariffs charged final consumers are inadequate to recover
the incremental cost of the project.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During negotiations the following issues were raised with GOI and
satisfactory agreement or assurances were obtained with regard to:

FARAKKA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Regional Demand and Supply - Eastern Region
Shortages and Restrictions
1.        During 1978/79, Orissa SEB was the only supply authority in the
region with a comfortable power supply position, supporting neighboring Bihar
during times of capacity and energy shortage. No officially notified restric-
tions were in force in Bihar, but ad hoc load shedding procedures were used
when available peak capacity was insufficient. Similarly, DVC had to resort
to temporary restrictions for its industrial consumers and for the supply
to CESC, due to unscheduled outages at some generating units.
2.        WBSEB's official restrictions on consumption and load have been in
force since July 1976. The main provisions are (i) a 15% cut in the potential
unrestricted maximum demand of industrial consumers, (ii) one day of the week
without supply for industrial consumers, (iii) availability of evening peak
supply for domestic and most large industrial consumers only. These rather
severe cuts have been intensified during 1979. Low plant availability appears
to be one of the primary reasons for the shortages; it is expected that the
cuts in supply will have to be maintained for several years to come.
The Project in the Regional Context
3.        At the time of appraisal, the allocation of generating capacity from
the proposed project to individual supply authorities in the region had not
been decided on. It is, however, expected that allocations will be roughly
in line with the present relative capacities of the participating authorities.
In 1984/85, the first 400 MW of project capacity are to be made available
to the region. From 1985/86 onwards, the full 600 MW of the project will
form part of regional capacity. At that time, this will be the equivalent
of about 10% of unrestricted potential peak demand in the region, a significant
contribution to the easing of shortages.
4.        In terms of energy supplied to the Eastern region grid from the
project, the following annual availability is projected:
1984/85                        750 GWh
1985/86                      1,950 GWh
1986/87                      2,850 GWh
beyond  1987/88                      3,300 GWh
At the maximum, this will represent about 8% of total regional unrestricted
energy demand.

INDIA
FARAKKA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Financial Position of the State Electricity Boards and DVC
1.        The problems associated with the SEBs' financial position have been
the subject of continuing dialogue with GOI. Under previous transmission
Credits/Loan, the beneficiary SEBs undertook to achieve and maintain rates of
return after tax of 9.5% (on a rate base stated at actual cost), in some cases
on a graduated basis, in order to take account of particular circumstances
(see Attachment 1). In all cases the 9.5% rate was to be achieved by FY1979.
Results have been moderately successful, with a wide variation in performance
between SEBs. By FY1977, seven out of the sixteen major SEBs achieved
their target rates of return, with a further two SEBs reaching their targets
in FY1978 with the help of rural electrification subsidies from their State
Governments under the conditions of eligibility for the Second Rural Electri-
fication Project (Credit 911-IN). Uttar Pradesh SEB expects to reach 9.5%
in FY1979 mainly due to State Government rural electrification subsidization
commencing in that year, again under eligibility criteria of Credit 911-IN.
The other six SEBs, while not reaching the stipulated return, showed improving
trends through FY1977. However, the situation generally deteriorated during
FYs 1978 and 1979 to leave seven out of the sixteen major SEBs with their
rates of return below the stipulated target. This group included two Eastern
Region SEBs, Orissa and Bihar (which along with West Bengal SEB and the DVC
will be the recipients of Farakka power).
2.        The main reason for the poor financial performance of some of the
SEBs was that tariffs have not kept pace with increases in operating costs,
thus not ensuring that a healthy ratio between operating income and capital
base is maintained during periods of expansion. Other factors which have
adversely affected financial performance were: low availability of plant and
of power imports from neighboring State systems, and increased cost of these
imports because of a higher proportion of expensive thermal power where pre-
viously cheaper hydro power was available. It can be justifiably argued that
the situation faced by some SEBs did not constitute "normal circumstances" and
that the achievement of covenanted rates of return could not realistically be
expected.
3.        The financial performance of the Eastern Region SEBs and the DVC 1/
was discussed with GOI and CEA officials during appraisal. The performance of
1/   Overall responsibility for power supply in the Damodar Valley area is
vested in the DVC, a statutory body set up under the Damodar Valley
Act of 1948. The DVC operates power plants to meet the load demands
of the Damodar Valley area and also supplies bulk power to Bihar and
West Bengal SEBs and the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation (CESC)
to meet part of the power requirements outside the valley area.

the DVC was an exception to the general trend. Over recent years, rates of
return (including duties and taxes) in excess if 20% were achieved, a credit-
able performance which is expected to be maintained in the immediate future.
It was pointed out to the mission that there were special problems associated
with the power industry in the Eastern Region which required special treatment.
This region was the most vulnerable area in India as regards power availability.
Installation of additional capacity lagged behind the performance of States in
other regions primarily because of a lack of financial resources. Some of
these States have contributed up to 40% of their expansion programs.  The
States in the Eastern Region, particularly Bihar, have, in the past, lacked
the financial resources for larger investment in power facilities and Bihar
has its own particular problems in organizing its electricity industry to meet
the growing demand.
4.        Bihar has one of the lowest per capita incomes in the whole country
and a high unemployment rate. Projections received from the Bihar SEB for the
three years up to March 31, 1983 (Annex 6, Attachment 2) indicate that a rate
of return of less than 2% will be achieved. This performance has been viewed
with great concern both at Center and State levels. The matter has been taken
up with the Bihar State authorities at the highest levels to see how improve-
ments can be introduced. It is recognized that the conditions in the Bihar
SEB are somewhat different from most other Boards in the country. Generating
stations have had operational problems which have curtailed electricity output.
The Bihar SEB, as well as the State Government, have been advised and assisted
by the Center in studying these problems further. In addition, CEA has been
made responsible for monitoring the progress of these studies with a view
to the introduction of an action plan for overall improvement. A number of
problem areas requiring special attention have already been identified, more
particularly those relating to professional management, procurement of spare
parts, training and project implementation. In the circumstances, the imme-
diate restoration of the covenanted rate of return of 9.5% cannot realistically
be expected. Indeed, the introduction of any financial rehabilitation program
must first await the outcome of the investigations currently going on in Bihar.
In the meantime, CEA will keep the Bank Group advised of developments in these
endeavors. A formal report on the position of the Bihar SEB will be sent to
the Bank Group within the next six months.
5.        The following is the position with regard to the other two SEBs
in the Eastern Region:
Orissa:    The rate of State electricity duty charged to con-
sumers is extremely high in comparison to the general
norm, being equivalent to as much as 5% of capital base,
as against a target of 1.5%. Consequently, if the
gross economic return is compared with the target of
11% (including duties) the annual projections through
FY1983 (Annex 6, Attachment 2) show that the target
will be exceeded by 1.9 percentage points in FY1981,
3.0 percentage points in FY1982 (when the covenanted
rate of return of at least 9.5% will also be achieved)
and 2.5 percentage points in FY1983. This performance
is considered as satisfactory, considering the periodic

low availability of hydro power in recent years in
what is a predominantly hydro system, coupled with
chronic low availability of some thermal plant--a
combination of events which led to low generation and
consequently reduced sales and revenues.
West
Bengal:   The Board achieved its covenanted rate of return (un-
audited) of 9.5% in FY1979. However, because of the
doubling of installed capacity projected during the
three years to March 1983 and the phased build up to
stabilised generation of the new plant, additional
revenues will not be received in proportion to increases
in capital base. Consequently, rates of return projected
for the four years ended March 1983 (Annex 6, Attachments
1 and 2) of from 7.0% rising to 9.3% must be regarded as
reasonable. The mission was informed that efforts are
being made to complete modifications and improvements
in existing installed capacity in order to improve avail-
ability factors and boost revenues. The Bank Group will
be kept advised of developments.
6.        Recognizing the need to improve the financial performance of the
Eastern Region SEBs in a comprehensive manner, GOI, through CEA, held dis-
cussions with the State Governments and their SEBs in November 1979. There
was general consensus that concerted efforts were necessary to improve the
finances of the Boards. Agreement was reached on the introduction of the
following measures:
(i)  SEBs would prepare accounts half yearly, the results to be
monitored by both the Sate Government at higher levels and
also by CEA;
(ii) a monthly reporting system by SEBs and Central agencies on
project implementation would be reactivated;
(iii) targets for reducing transmission end distribution losses
and auxiliary consumption;
(iv) a system of accountability would be enforced for non-
performance of targets; and
(v)  CEA would issue guidelines and would review financial
performance every six months.
The introduction of the above measures would go a long way towards bringing
greater control over the financial management of SEBs. CEA will keep the
Bank Group advised of progress in their implementation.

7.        The financial provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, were
recently amended to put the operations of the SEBs on a more commercial basis
by enabling them to generate internally a reasonable contribution to their
capital investments. Under the Amendments (Section 59(1)), the State Govern-
ments are now required to specify the level of annual surplus which should be
earned by their SEBs to enable them to comply with the amended legislation.
The manner in which this will be achieved is a subject which has been under
evaluation by both the State Governments in conjunction with their SEBs, and
by the finance panel of the Rajadhyaksha Committee. Complex issues are involved
which will require "tailoring" by each State Government to meet the particular
circumstances of its SEB, while at the same time giving due consideration to
State resources and impact on consumers. CEA has issued guidelines to the
State Governments and the SEBs explaining these issues and pointing out the
measures that need to be taken by each of them and the options which are
available.
8.        The guidelines emphasize the following aspects:
(i) special steps to increase sales volume;
(ii)  economies in both operating costs and capital expenditure;
(iii) more efficient asset utilization;
(iv)  timely commissioning of new projects;
(v) reduction in line losses;
(vi)  improved financial management;
(vii) tariff revisions to reflect cost of supply;
(viii) capital structure adjustments - SEBs may now receive funds from
the State Government in the form of share capital, and State
Government loans may now be converted into share capital;
(ix)  disposal of arrears of State Government loan interest; and
(x) basis for charging depreciation of fixed assets.
9.        Because of the far reaching consequences of the above measures, the
State Governments and their SEBs are awaiting the findings of the Rajadhyaksha
Committee before implementing financial policies to give effect to the financial
amendments of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948. The Committee's report is
expected to be presented to the Government in May 1980.

1/ Target rate of return in general is 9.5%. When this was established in 1964, it was also conceived that an average excise tax
or duty equiivalent to a return of 1.5% would be applied, making the total expected return 11%.  Effective March 1978, GOI has
levied an additional excise tax of 2 paise/kWh of generation which is not included above.  This would add an estimated 2-3
percentage points to the returns noted.

-/ Reduction in return is due to a large increase in capital base for that year because of the commissioning of
new plant, not compensated by increased revenues until the plant is fully stabilized (normally takes 3/4 years).
- High return due to relatively low capital base and because of the impact of additional revenue earning activities.

FARAKKA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Description of the Farakka Development
1.        The Farakka development is one of a series of large thermal power
stations planned by the Government of India, to feed into a 400 kV inter-
connected transmission system and supply bulk power to the State Electricity
Boards (SEBs).
2.        The Farakka 1,100 MW power station is to be installed on the West
Bank of the Farakka feeder canal and will utilize coal from the Hurra block
of mines of the Rajmahal coal fields in Bihar.
3.        The plant will consist of three 200 MW and one 500 MW generating
units with boiler plant, ancilliary electrical and mechanical equipment and
associated 400 kV transmission. The Project, which represents the first stage
of the development, will consist of the three 200 MW installations.
4.        The 200 MW turbines will be thre2 cylinder, tandem compound type
with initial steam conditions of 150 kg/cm  and 535 0C.  The generators will
be hydrogen cooled and will each be rated at 235,300 kVA.  The boilers will
be natural circulation, pulverized fuel fired, balanced draft type using the
direct firing system. Each boiler will have a continuous evlporation rating
of 670 t/h with a superheater outlet pressure of 155.5 kg/cm and temperature
of 540 C. Each 200 MW generating unit will be connected to a 250 MVA trans-
former and will feed power into the 400 kV system.
4.        The 500 MW turbine will be three cylinder reheat condensing type
having one HP cylinder, one double flow IP cylinder and one double flow LP
cylinder with initial steam parameters of 168 kg/cm  and 538 0C/538 C.  The
generators will be water and hydrogen cooled, each rated at 588 MVA. The
boiler will be controlled circulation, pulverised fuel fired, balanced draft
type using the direct firing system. The boiler will have a continuous
evaporati n rating of 1,700 t/h with a superheater outlet pressure of
178 kg/cm and temperature of 540 0C. Each generating unit would have 4 single
phase 200 MVA 21/400 kV transformers and will feed power into the 400 kV system.
5.        The salient features of the development are shown below: -

POWER STATION
Capacity                         -  1,100 MW (3x200 MW + lx500 MW)
Fuel                             -  Coal from the Hurra Block of Rajmahal
coalfields, located about 50 km from
the power station. Consumption of the
1,100 MW power station at 5,500 h of oper-
ation per year is about 4 million t/year.
The average calorific value of the coal is
3,600 kcal/kg; moisture 3.7-10.1%; ash 19.7-
44.5%; sulfur 0.3-1.5%.
Transport                        -  Unit train continuous system with bottom
of Coal                             discharging wagons.
Cooling System                   -  The power station's requirements of cooling
water are proposed to be met from the Fasakka
feeder canal with a flow exceeding 575 m
(20,500 cu ft)/sec. As there is an abundance
of water available from the canal compared to
cooling water requirements, the power station
would be designed for once-through cooling.
The estimated requirements of cogling water
for the 1,100 MW station is 45 m (1,600 cu
ft)/sec, almost all of which would be re-
turned to the canal. The consumptive water
requirements for boiler make-up and township
would be comparatively small. Water will
flow from the feeder canal through a channel
up to a pump house where it will be pumped
to the power house. Provision is allowed
for a second stage pump house, in line with
the first stage, which may be constructed
later. After cooling the condensers, the
water will be discharged into a channel
through a discharge duct and lead back into
the feeder canal at a point approximately
1.5 km downstream of the intake, where a
suitable diffusion device will be provided.
Temperature of the water in the feeder canal,
will rise 2-30C as a result of this, but it
will gradually cool down to about its orig-
inal temperature as it flows from there.

Ash Disposal                     -  The ash disposal area is available approxi-
mately 6.5 km from the power station site.
Ash would be pumped as a slurry through a
pipeline. Skimmers would be provided to
obtain relatively ash free water from the
disposal area which would overflow to
natural drainage.
Land                             -  A total area of approximately 1,175 ha
(2,900 acres), excluding land for the coal
transportation system, is required for the
project. This includes about 290 ha (720
acres) for the power station, switchyard,
coal storage etc. and 120 ha (300 acres) for
the residential colony. An area of about
750 ha (1850 acres) would be acquired for
ash disposal.
TRANSMISSION
400 kV lines   first stage       -  (Farakka-Durgapur      : 165 circuit km
required        (600 MW)            (Farakka-Jeerhat       : 245   "       "
second stage        Farakka-Mokamah        :  230   "      i
Also associated switchgear, telemetry and
metering equipment, land, buildings and
other miscellaneous works.

NOTE:  Section XVII(8) of the 6th Schedule of the Electricity



- 73 -
ANNEX 16
Page 3 of 5 pages
(Supply) Act 1948, provides for depreciation "from the
beginning of the year of account next following that in
which the particular asset became available for use in
the business". Under the recently enacted financial amend-
ments to the Act, in the future depreciation is to be
charged in accordance with the directions to be issued by
GOI. GOI has issued a notification covering FY1979 which
makes no change in the 1948 Act provisions. Notifications
covering future years will be issued in due course.
(g) Tariffs. NTPC has an obligation to achieve a rate of return
of not less than 9.5% on the forecast average net fixed assets
in service by FY1989, and from the commencement of its commer-
cial operations in FY1982 to set tariffs at levels not lower
than those required to achieve a 9.5% rate of return on the
forecast data for FY1989. On this basis, and bearing in mind
the time it takes for the generating plant to reach an operating
level of 5,500 hours a year, the average price of 29.08 paise/kWh
calculated on the FY1989 estimates, is assumed as the average
price for all sales from February 1982.
(h) Fuel. Fuel costs are based on the prices per ton shown in
paragraph 2(c) and escalated until FY1982. Thereafter a fuel
clause is assumed in the bulk supply contract, to permit
adjustment to meet any further variation in fuel costs. The
effect of any fuel price variation is shown separately in the
forecast expenses and recovered by means of a fuel surcharge.
(i) Rate Base
(i) Singrauli. Construction costs are based on 1979 prices
escalated at rates given in schedule below except where
orders have been placed when escalation is applied from
award date onwards. The main plant equipment costs for
the three 200 MW phase are, however, based on the award
made in 1978.
(ii) Korba. Construction costs are based on 1979 prices
escalated at rates given in the schedule below.
(iii)  Ramagundam.  Construction costs are based on 1978 prices
escalated at rates given in the schedule below; however,
the main plant equipment value for the three 200 MW units
is based on the actual awarded value in 1980.
(iv) Farakka. Construction costs are based on 1978 prices
escalated at rates given in schedule below.
(v) Escalation Schedule
Price escalation:



- 74 -                   ANNEX 16
Page 4 of 5 pages
a. 6% per annum for the year 1979-80
b.  10% per annum for the year 1980-81
c.  7% per annum for the years 1981-82 through 1983-84
d.  5% for year 1984-85 and onwards
The turbine generators and steam generators are, however,
subject to the following maximum price escalation from the
date of order:
Singrauli 200 MW units - 25%
Korba, Ramagundam &
Farakka 200 MW units   -  20%
500 MW units for all
projects                 -  15% turbine generators
20% steam generators
Physical Escalation:
Civil works              -  10% of construction cost
Equipment                -  5% of equipment cost
(j) Capital Requirements
(i) The proposed loan and credit would be relent by the GOI
to NTPC for a period of 20 years from the date of with-
drawal of the first installment including a 5 year initial
grace period, and repayable in equal semi-annual install-
ments of principal, together with interest at the rate of
10.25% per annum on unpaid balances.
(ii) Other capital requirements would be advanced by GOI in
the form of debt and fully paid up equity capital, pro-
vided that the unpaid debt at the end of each year would
not exceed the sum of the issued share capital and the
"free" reserves, that is to say those which are not
required for specific purposes. Advances would initially
be in the form of equity capital (up to FY1984) and loan
capital thereafter.
(iii)  GOI loans (including the onlending of both the proposed
loan and credit and also previously approved credits and
loan) are assumed to finance either defined projects or

NTPC's Bulk Tariff (Eastern Region) and
Bulk Exchange Tariffs in the Eastern Region
1.        The proposed regional financial bulk tariff of about 32 paise/kWh
for supply from Farakka to the Eastern Region should be considered in the
general context of "bulk" tariffs and costs obtaining in the Region. Tariffs
charged between supply authorities for energy exchanges in 1978/79 were as
follows:
Paise/kWh
- BSEB purchase from OSEB                         21-28
- DVC purchase from OSEB                            28
- Emergency exchange                                11
2.        These exchange tariffs at voltages similar to that proposed for
Farakka are arrived at after reaching a compromise on opposing views. In
theory, an elaborate system of guidelines exists in the Eastern Region,
defining the method of calculating cost-related tariffs. In reality, however,
the tariff is often agreed on only after lengthy negotiations.
3.        It should be borne in mind that the present exchange tariffs, if
regularly adjusted for general inflation, could reach a range of 18-46 paise/kWh
by 1985, when the first Farakka energy will be supplied, and a level of 22-56
paise/kWh by the late 1980's: at that time the Farakka tariff is still projected
to be at 32 paise, thus falling behind the general average regional exchange
tariff level.
4.        The cost of energy supply at high voltage levels in the Region
can be estimated by using the following samples of average financial cost as
calculated by SEBs:
Paise/kWh (1979) /a
OSEB                                            10
WBSEB                                           18
Weighted average                                16
/a Including cost of purchases.



- 78 -               ANNEX 18
Page 2 of 2 Pages
5.        Again assuming adjustment for inflation, the average SEB cost
of supply at voltage levels comparable to NTPC's would be 24 paise/kWh in
1985, and would rise to about 29 paise/kWh by 1989. NTPC power is likely to
be more expensive than the SEB's accounting estimate of the cost of their own
generation in part because depreciation is less on the old assets owned by the
SEBs and in part because some SEB energy comes from hydro plant with very low
operating cost. Particularly for SEBs such as Orissa, (or any SEB relying on
hydro power to a large extent), NTPC power will appear to be a costly purchase.

Regional Marginal Cost Analysis of NTPC Operations
1.         The following assumptions are necessary to make marginal cost
analysis for NTPC a relevant exercise that can enter as an input into tariff
considerations:
(i) each station is reviewed as an independent system
selling power in bulk to the Region concerned.
(ii) Whether or not there will be additional investment by NTPC
in each Region beyond the presently planned program, NTPC at
each of its regional stations will ultimately operate at its
capacity limit. This implies that any incremental demand will
have to be satisfied by further investment, and justifies
the inclusion of representative marginal capacity cost in the
tariff.
(iii) All sales of energy will be at the level of 400 kV.
(iv) There will be no seasonal and only minor daily variation in
NTPC's load demand: all stations will be operated as base
load for the participating SEBs, thus eliminating any peaks
in NTPC operations.
(v) For each station, the program of commissioning of units and
annual hours of operation is taken as planned by NTPC.
2.         The method used for the computation of an approximation of long-run
marginal cost is the concept of Average Incremental Cost (AIC), smoothing
out any fluctuations by averaging over the entire known investment program.
The results are expressed in terms of both (i) a uniform energy charge per
Region, incorporating both marginal capacity and energy costs; and (ii) a
two-part tariff consisting of a capacity charge and an energy charge, recover-
ing marginal capacity and energy costs, respectively.
3.         The basic computation is performed in terms of constant 1979 costs.
In order to arrive at marginal cost in future years when energy will be sold
to SEBs, it is assumed (in the absence of a longer-term investment plan) that
any investment necessary to satisfy incremental demand beyond NTPC capacity at
that time will have the same pattern as the investment envisaged for the late
1970's and 1980's. For this purpose, marginal cost for future years is
arrived at by updating the 1979 marginal cost by a projected inflation rate
of 10% per year initially, decreasing to 5% in 1984. All marginal costs are
expressed in constant market prices of the year in question, and discounted at
10% p.a.

FARAKKA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Additional Transmission and Distribution Cost
1.        The draft plan 1978-83 provides for about 58% of the expenditure to
be allocated to generation, the rest to transmission, distribution and rural
electrification (i.e. rural distribution). Non-generation expenditure, there-
fore, accounts for about 70% of generation expenditure.
2.        The cost of the project already includes a transmission element which
accounts for about 10% of the generating plant component. The difference to
the regional average is, therefore, allocated to the project to enable a
comparison with tariff revenue at retail level: an additional investment
necessary to serve final consumers.
3.        Operating and maintenance expenditure on the additional transmission
and distribution facilities is assumed to be 2% of the cumulative value of
the assets installed.
4.        The split by cost components of the additional investment is
assumed to be similar to that of the original transmission component included
in the project, and is expressed in identical economic terms.
5.        The amount of energy sold to final consumers is arrived at by
reducing the kWh sent out from the project (after auxiliary use) by the
average regional system losses:

Shadow Pricing of Costs and Benefits
1. Conversion Factors
Where CIF or FOB prices of tradeable goods (or tradeable inputs
into domestically manufactured goods) are not readily available, the following
factors are used to convert domestic costs of non-traded goods to border
prices:
Standard conversion factor                       0.87
Capital goods conversion factor                  0.78
Local materials conversion factor                0.87
2. Shadow Wage Rate
Before converting labor cost to border prices, using the standard
conversion factor, the following assumptions about the economic value of labor
are made:
Skilled labor: 100% of market wage,
Unskilled labor: 75% of market wage.
Furthermore, about 60% of the total labor cost of the project in terms of
1979 market prices are assumed to be attributable to skilled labor.
3. Aluminum Component of Transmission
The domestic aluminum price being subsidized, it is necessary
to use the higher CIF price to establish economic cost at a time of import
necessity. The aluminum content of the domestic ex-works cost of conductor
(excluding the labor content) is about 50%. A CIF price of $1,800/ton is
applied to this cost element, increasing it by about 20%.
4. Economic Cost of Coal
Rather than using the domestic administered price of coal, its
economic value is expressed by identifying the average production cost as
follows:

Labor cost is assumed to consist of 50% skilled and 50% unskilled
labor; stores to consist of capital goods and local materials; capital goods
costs are converted to border prices at the capital goods conversion factor,
other expenditure at the standard conversion factor. The economic cost of
coal amounts to Rs 68-70/t. An average of Rs 69/t is used.
For the alternative to the project, the following cost of coal is
assumed, reflecting transport from the closest location:

5. Opportunity Cost of Capital
A range between 10 and 13% is assumed to reflect the rate of return
on public investment in the economy.
6. Benefits
The alternative use of consumers' expenditure for electricity is
assumed to be expenditure on a basket of tradeable goods. Consequently, the
standard conversion factor is used to convert the benefit proxies to border
prices.

FARAKKA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Economic Benefits
1.        The approach used is one of identifying a proxy for the minimum
benefit that reflects the willingness of consumers to pay for incremental
power supply. The traditional method is to use tariff revenue for this
purpose, bearing in mind that actual, non-quantified, benefits are consid-
erably higher, both because of the existence of a consumers' surplus, and
because of the non-market, subsidized level of power tariffs. Some of this
surplus is identifiable if the cost incurred by industrial consumers for the
purchase and operation of diesel standby generating sets is included in the
benefits instead of the industrial tariff revenue only. A further refinement
would be to express benefits in terms of industrial and agricultural output
gained by the project's alleviation of power outages that interrupt production.
Other benefits such as greater work, leisure, and educational benefits accru-
ing to domestic consumers are quantifiable only with difficulty.
Tariff Revenue
2.        The minimum proxy for benefits in the region is arrived at as
follows:
Share of Regional    Average Tariff 1979
State                       Consumption (%)           (paise/kWh)
Bihar                             34                        31.4
Orissa                            19                        16.6
West Bengal                       47                        29.6
Weighted average (financial)                                27.8
Weighted average (economic)                                 24.2
Cost of Standby Generation
3.        The following samples were used to establish the capital cost of
recently purchased standby diesel sets:

Unit size (KVA)           Cost of set (1978 Rs)          Rs/KVA
244                           284,000                2,869
200                           600,000                3,000
315                         1,000,000                3,174
244                           700,000                2,869
Assuming an average 1979 purchase price of about Rs 3,000/kW, plus 10%
installation charges, the total installed cost would be Rs 3,300/ kW. Power
cost can be derived as follows:
Life of set:    15 years
Average utilization: 4,400 hours/year (50% load factor)
Annual        Cost - Rs/kWh
Annual charge at 13% discount rate:         Rs 510/kW          Rs 0.12
Annual O&M cost:                            Rs 180             Rs 0.04
Fuel and lubricant cost at 0.25 l/kWh
@ Rs 1.50/1 (Rs 9/1 for lubricant):                            Rs 0.38
Total cost (financial):                                        Rs 0.54
Total cost (border prices) about:                              Rs 0.52
4.        The economic cost of Rs 0.52/ kWh (at the assumed load factor)
represents the observed maximum willingness to pay for continuous power
supply.  Combined with the average regional industrial tariff of 27 paise/kWh
(Bihar: 34, West Bengal: 22, Orissa: 26) and its economic equivalent of 23
paise/kWh, the resulting average benefit proxy for industrial consumers is 38
paise/kWh in economic terms. 1/ It can be assumed that this represents the
minimum willingness to pay.
1/   Assuming a sloping demand curve for industrial energy inputs.
