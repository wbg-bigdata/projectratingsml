PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
FARAKKA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(CREDIT 1053-IN AND LOAN 1887-IN)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Farakka Thermal
Power Project in India, for which Credit 1053-IN and Loan 1887-IN in the
amounts of US$225 million and US$25 million, respectively, were approved on
June 26, 1980. The credit was closed on December 31, 1988 and the loan on
June 30, 1989, 2 years 3 months behind schedule. The credit was fully
disbursed. However, the loan could not be fully disbursed. An undisbursed
balance of US$12,216,283.43 was cancelled from the loan effective February 1,
1990.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Transport and Energy Operations
Division, Country Department IV (India) and the Energy Division, Technical
Department, both of the Asia Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary,
PaLts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
Prepazation of this PCR was started by the Borrower during the Bank
Group's Supervision Mission in October, 1989. However, subsequently based on
the revised guidelines for PCRs, a fresl draft was begun on arrival of the
Bank Group's final Supervision Mission in February 1990, and is based, inter
alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 2976a - IN), the Development Credit,
Loan and Project Agreements, correspondence between the Bank Group and the
Borrower and internal Bank Group memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
FARAKKA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(CREDIT 1053-IN AND LOAN 1887-IN)
Evaluation Summary
Objectives
The two main objectives of the project were:  (i) to provide NTPC
assistance to alleviate power shortages in the Eastern Region Interconnected
System of India by installing three 200 MW each of coal fired units as the
first stage of NTPC's Farakka Thermal Power Project; and (ii) to assist GOI in
achieving its objective of further advancing the regional and national
integration of the power subsector. (Part I, para. 2 and 3).
Implementation Experience
NTPC successfully implemented the project. However, there were
certain delays in the implementation on account of the contractors' industrial
relations problems including law and order situation in nearabout areas. No.
1 unit was commissioned eight months behind the revised schedule and No. 2 and
No. 3 units were coammissioned thirteen and fifteen months, respectively,
behind the revised schedule. Timely corrective actions taken by NTPC arrested
the possibility of further delays. (Part I, para. 9-12).
Results
The project fully achieved its main objectives through successful
completion of three 200 MW units of the first stage of Farakka station and
associated 400 kV transmission lines. NTPC's financial rate of return on
historically valued net fixed assets for the last four years was between 14Z
and 172 against the covenanted rate of return of 9.5Z for the period FY89 and
beyond. The economic rate of return of the project was about 19Z against the
estimated figure of about 131. (Part I, para. 15 to 19).
Sustainability
Operati)nal efficiency of NTPC, in this power station as well as in
other NTPC plants is good in spite of the continuous high growth rate of the
utility and thus contributes to keeping up benefits from the projects NTPC
carries out. (Part I, paras. 20 to 23)
Findings and Lessons Learned
Major findings were as follows:
(a) Design and engineering work for the project were successfully carried
out in-house by NTPC, based on its experience with earlier projects,
with very limited support from outside. '---t I, para. 4); and



(b) The project site being situated in a low lying area prune to flash
floods with extremely difficult soil condition and high ground water
level, posed difficult civil engineering challenges, which were
successfully overcome by the NTPC. This experience has been
effectively utilized in the implementation of the second stage
Farakka project. (Part I, para. 27).
Lessons to be learned from this project are summarized as follows:
(a) To improve implementation performance and consequently to accelerate
disbursements, key actions should be taken up-front. In the case of
this project, the procurement action should have been proceeded more
quickly (Part I. para. 10);
(b) The Bank Group could have been more forceful in seeking NTPC's
compliance with the receivables covenan.', a critical element to
ensure NTPC's liquidity. (Pa- I, para. 29).
(c) Similarly, the Bank could have be.n more convincing in its efforts to
improve the revenue covenant. (Part I, para. 29); and
(d)  The Bank Group should have acted earlier in encouraging NTPC to
enhance its ability to address environmental and resettlement
matters. In this context, the implementation of the Environmental
Action Plan agreed within the proposed NTPC-Regional Puwer System
Project should be monitored by the Bank very closely (Part I, paras.
13, 14 and 25).

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
Project Identity
Name:              Farakka Thermal Power Project
Credit/Loan No:   Credit 1053-IN and Loan 1887-IN
RVP Unit:          Asia Region
Country:           India
Sector:            Energy
Subsector:         Power
Background
1.       Power shortages of the 1970's and the adverse effect these were
having on the productive sectors of the economy prompted the Government of
India (GOI) to intensify its efforts to balance the demand and supply of
electricity. The strategy of the GOI was to supplement efforts of State
Electricity Boards (SEBs) in increasing installed capacity and the
establishment of high voltage transmission lines. Emphasis was laid in the
power subsector to: (i) accelerating the development of the hydro power
potential and large coal fired power plants at both pithead locations and the
proximity of load centers; (ii) improving the efficiency of thermal power
plants and reducing losses in transmission and distribution networks;
(iii) expanding the rural electrification program; and (iv) strengthening the
organizational and management capabilities of the SEBs. In 1974 GOI decided
to proceed with the construction of first stage of four large thermal power
stations of 600 MW each at Singrauli, Korba, Ramagunidam and Farakka, located
near coal fields and supplying bulk power to the beneficiaries through
interconnected 400 kv transmission systems. GOI established in 1975 two power
generating companies, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and the
National Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC) to construct and operate large thermal
and hydro power stations and associated transmission systems. The feasibility
study of the Farakka project was prepared by NTPC in 1978 and the project
appraisal was made by the Bank group in 1979.
Project Objectives
2.       The primary objectives of the project were to: (a) provide NTPC with
assistance needed to assure its envisaged role, including t:.e alleviation of
power shortages in the Eastern Power Region of the country and (b) assist GOI
in achieving its objectives of fu:-ther advancing the regional and ultimately
the national integration of the power subsector.
Project Description
3.       The Farakka Thermal Power Project (Credit 105'-IN/Loan 1887-IN)
formed first stage of NTPC's Farakka Thermal Power Development program of
2,100 MW (3x200 MW + 2x500 MW + lx500 MW) ultimate capacity located in the



Mursh'dabad District of the State of West Bengal and consisted of the
installation of the three units of 200 MW each and associated transmission
facilities, including the following components:
(a)  acquisition of land, civil works comprising of roads, culverts and
other miscellaneous preliminary works, power station and residential
buildings, plant foundations, railways, canals, ducts and other works
associated with the 'circulating water systems;
(b)  three 680 tonnes/hour boilers and three 200 MW turbo-generating units
complete with all auxiliaries and ancillary electrical and mechanical
equipment including the switchyard;
(c) the 400 kV transmission lines, comprising one 165 km single circuit
line from Farakka to Durgapur and one 245 km single circuit line from
Farakka to Jeerhat; and
(d) a training simulator.
Acquisition of steel for structural works under NTPC's ongoing projects was
subsequently included under the scope of the project.
Project Design and  _anization
4.       Based on the experience gained by NTPC in executing similar projects
at Singrauli, Korba and Ramagundam, for the first time complete design and
engineering work for the Farakka Project was carried out in-house by NTPC with
very limited support from Indian consultants in a few areas.  However the
Project Design Memorandum was reviewed by a foreign consuilting firm.
5.       At the time of appraisal, NTPC had adopted a two-tier organizational
structure--one at the central/corporate level and the other at the project
sites. Technical services, contract and procurement services and quality
assurance, etc. were centralized.  For each of four power plants, a project
organization group under the control of a General Manager was organized to
manage the implementation of the particular project.
6.       NTPC was reorganized, subsequently, after the appraisal to have
three-tier organizational structure:
(a) corporate level;
(b) regional level; and
(c) project level.
7.       The Corporation is headed by a Chairman and Managing Director (CMD),
who is assisted by five full-time functional Directors, namely, Director
(Projects), Director (Operation), Director (Technical), Director (Finance) and
Director (Personnel). At the Corporate Office, corporate planning, central
procurement and vigilance functions are headed by Executive Directors
reporting to the CMD. For the purpose of the administration and execution of
work at the sites, the Corporation is divided into five regions (North, West,
East, South and National Capital Regions) whose headquarters are at present
located at Allahabad, Nagpur, Patna, Hyderabad and Delhi respectively.  These
regions are under the control of Regional Executive Directors who are



- 3 -
responsible for the implementation and operation and maintenance of power
plants and transmission systems in respective regions. Every power plant and
regional transmission unit is headed by a General Manager.
8.       The new structure has the advantage of reducing and optimizing che
span of control of the CMD. The structure provides for decentralization of
line responsibility while retaining centralized systems in areas such Is long-
term planning, basic engineering, procurement of critical equipment and
spares, quality assurance, co-ordination with the World Bank and other
financing agencies, inspertion etc.
Project Implementation
9.       The implementation of the project consisting of three 200 MW units
and associated 400 kV transmission lines have been completed with about one
year delay frem the revised implementation schedule. The first unit was
commissioned in January, 1986 and subsequent units in December, 1986 and
August, 1987 respectively.
10.      At the time of appraisal. the last 200 MW unit (third unit) of the
project was scheduled to be commissioned in August, 1985 based on the award of
the main plant equipment contract (i.e., boiler and turbo-generator) in
November, 1980 (zero date). The notice inviting tenders for the main plant
equipment was issued in September, 1979. Bids were opened in May, 1980 dfter
the negotiations for financing were held. However the award was made in May
1981, one year after receiving the tenders. The revised schedule for
commissioning of the last 200 MW unit, based on this zero date, was May 1986,
considering four years for commissioning of the first 200 MW unit from the
date of award for the main plant equipment and six months for eac' ubsequenL
200 MW units thereafter.
11.      Although NTPC implemented the project ia a similar manner to other
projects and awarded the other critical cont.acts to experienced contractors
in accordance with the revised schedule, delays as explained in para. 9 above
were experienced. The major reasons ware mainlv due to the contractors'
industrial relations problems including the law and order situation in near-
about areas.
12.      In spite of all timely efforts towards corrective actions taken by
NTPC, these constraints adversely affected the progress of the project. In
order to arrest further delay, contingency arrangements were made for
transportation of coal by rail-cum-road instead of Merry-Go-Round (MGR) systeml/
and also a coal crushing plant was installed because of delay in readiness of
main coal handling plant.
13.      The implementa.tion of the Project, including the subsequent expansion
phases of another 1500 MW,2/ required the acquisition of 1,683 hectares (4,207
acres) resulting in compensation of 10,550 families affecting 12 villages.
Part of the required area was needed for dumping the ash. A limited number of
shops were also allotted to oustees in the NTPC complex. There was no need to
construct a dedicated colony as no homesteads were lost. NTPC has also
1/  There were delays in implementation of the MCR system and the coal
loading infrastructure at the mine. Both of them were completed and
began operation in 1988.
2/ Farakka II (Ln. 2442-IN) for two 500 MW units and the proposed NTPC-
Regional Power Systems Project, includes Farakka III (one 500 MW unit).

provided civil amenities in the relocation colonf.es, including medical
facilities, periodic visits by medicsl officers and preventive check up,
public health is increasingly deteriorating in the colonies, partly as a
result of a larger squatter settlement which has grown arour.d the area.
Limited numbers of oustees were given employment ar.d on-the-job training by
NTPC, and employed through various contractors working for the project.
However, no employment opportunities have been provided to a majority of the
oustees, because of their low level of skills. However, it has to be
recognized that there are limits to NTPC's ability to resolve all the
environmental issues associated with a powez development project and that the
local government authoritics should be responsible for the public
infcastructure needed in the context (if a large project development. NTPC has
also taken appropriate mieasures with regard to stack emissions and water
effluents. They regularly monitor these aspects of environmental protection
and so far comply fully with environmental quality standards prescribed by the
Government.  Therefore no ecologi,al problems are envisaged.  In addition,
NTPC has begun a continuous afforestation program.
34.      As a result of problems encountered and experience gained,
particularly in Singrauli, as well as in other projects, including the Bank-
financed Kotba, Ramagundam and Farakka thermal-,.ower plants, the Bank
encouraged NTPC to become more aware of the particular complexities associated
with environmental and especially with resettlement iqsu's. In recent
projects -- e.g. the Talcher Thermal Power Project (Ln. 2845-IN) and the
proposed NTPC-Regional Power Systems Project -- the approach has been from the
beginning more cor'"rehensive. In the Talcher project a detailed environmental
impact assessment .as prepared prior to beginning the construction works. In
the case of the proposed NTPC-Regional Power Systems Pro4ect, NTPC first
recruited staff specialized in social and environmental sciencts and then
undertook a review of the environmental aspects at the four abovementioned
Bank-financed power stations in order to implement corrective measures to
adequately rehabilitate and preserve the physical and social environment in
those areas affected by these projects. To achieve this, NTPC has prepared an
Environmental Action Plan (EAP) addressing aspects related to:
(i) preparation of Environment Impact Assessments for existing and future
projects; (ii) resettlement and improvement of living conditions of the
displaced population; and (iii) development of afforestation plans. In
Farakka, an element of the EAP is the Environmental Impact Assessment (ETA),
which wao carr-.ed out by NTPC staff. The implementation of the EAP will be
monitor-i by the Bank very closely.
Project Results
15.      The project fully achieved its main objectives through successful
complecion of 600 MW additional power generation capacity and associated 400
kV transmission lines. The generation from the project after commercial
oppration was 4,972 GWh as of the closing date (December, 1989). The unitwise
decails are given in Part III.
16.      The estimatel cost of the project at appraisal was USS527.1 million.
The final cost is about US$627.79 million as shown in Part III. The increase
ln total cost of about 19Z is mainly due to physical changes based on the
detailed engineering and due to price escalation.
17.      The estimated disbursements at appraisal and actual disbursements are
given in Part III. The original closing date of loan/credit was March 1987.
Actually the crrdit was closed on December 31, 1988 and loan on June 30, 1989,



after two extensions.  Disbursements against commitments were made till
June 30, 1989 for credit and till December 31, 1989 for loan ard outstanding
balance of USSl2,216,283.43 was cance.lled from the loan cffect_ e February 1,
1990.
18.      The allocation of the loan into various categories and actual
disbursement catcgory-wise are shown in Part III. The original allocation was
revised in December 19e6 to reflect changes in financing for the erection and
structural steel works.
19.      In the SAR, the ex-ante internal economic rate of return (IERR) for
the project was estimated at about 1.3 percent, based on measurable economic
costs and benefits associated with a 1,100 M4 davelopment. The ex-post IERR
for the 600 MW development i about 19 percent as shown in Annex 1.
Project Sustainability
20.      As in most power projects, the econLomic evaluation of the project in
both, the SAR and the PCR, uses revenues from sales as a proxy from economic
benefits and therefore fails to give the full picture. Further,
sustainability of benefits from power projects is closely linked to that of
the sector and of the utility. Therefore, in the present context, it has to
be asceitrined in a rather qualitative way, through the factors that affect
it.
21.      The political and economic environment has been stable and is
expected to continue to be so. For many years there have been shortages in
the supplv of electricity. These are likely to persist, because, although GOI
is strongly committed to the development of the power sector as one of the
bases for both industrial and rural development, the Government is not in a
position to allocate the full amount of funds the sector would require to meet
the demand. The unresolved discrepancies between the states' and GOI's
positions concerning the organization and the roles of the various entities of
the sector may tend to lead to economically sub-optimal solutions, but not to
an extent that they would endanger sustainability of benefits from existing
facihities, in general, and from the Farakka power plant, in particular.
22.      The institutional setup of the sector is progressing, albeit slowly,
towards a structure combining as much as possible regionalizat.on of
operations with countrywide optimization of the use of resources. There is
still a long way to such optimization.
23.      The project was si!-cessful in that all the three units were completed
satisfactorily and are genierating the much-needed electricity for the Eastern
Region. NTPC's capacity in designing and implementing 200 MW units was
successfully tested when the Corporation designed and supervised the complete
project. Operational efficiency of Farakka and NTPC's other power plants and
transmission systems is good in spite of the continuous high growth rate of
the utility and thus contributes to keeping up benefits from the projects NTPC
carries out. Strengthening of NTPC's project design, implementation,
operation and maintenance capabilities together with the realization of
successfully operating 600 MW additional operating capacity are indicators
that show that benefits from the project would be sustained over the long-
term.



-6-
IDA/Bank Performance
24.      The performance of the Bank Group from the project preparation
through project completion was satisfactory. The Bank Group maintained good
relations with the beneficiary throughout the execution of the project and
fostered an environment conducive to increased Bank Group involvement with
NTPC. To date the Bank Group has assisted NTPC in implementing a total of 13
projects. With a total assistance of about 4 billion dollars. Through these
operations the Bank Group has been strengthening the institutional and
financial viability of the corporation. It is important to highlight that,
during this initial decade of development, NTPC and the Bank Group developed a
close relationship, during which the Bank Group has endeavored to support NTPC
in each step of its development, in a manner that goes much beyond the
substantial financial assistance extended to its expansion plan.
25.      The Bank Group has also continued addressing a number of shortcomings
of broader sectoral concern. Major items are:
(a) During the preparation of the recent projects, a more comprehensive
and up-front approach towards environmental protection, resettlement
and rehabilitation issues has been adopted and an Environmental
Action Plan, aimed to complement earlier efforts has already been
drawn up for Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka projects, under
the recently negotiated NTPC-Regional Power Systems Project;
(b) Implementation of an Action Plan to liquidate accumulation of arrears
receivdbles from SEBd.
(c) Development of the Power Management Institute (PMI) to provide
specialized training in management and other aspects of the power
sector.
Borrower Performance
26.      The performance of NTPC was generally commendable and met most of the
expectations of the appraisal report.
27.      For the first time complete design and engineering work for the
project were successfully carried out by the NTPC in-house based on its
experience with earlier projects, with very limited support from outside.
Further, the project site being situated in a low lying area prone to flash
flood with extremely difficult soil condition and high ground water table
level, posed difficult civil engineering challenges, which were successfully
overcome by the NTPC. This experience has been effectively utilized in the
implementation of the second stage Farakka project. The quality assurance and
inspf,tion system which include manufacturing quality plans, field quality
plans, quality audit and surveillance was good.
28.      The project management system, successfully implemented at the
earlier project, was also successfully utilized. However, there were certain
delays in the implementation because of the reasons as explained earlier.
Despite all timely cor.-ective actions by the NTPC, various constraints
affected the project progress.
29.      The financial performance of 'TPC during this period of
implementation and initial years of operation were satisfactory. In
particular, !'4PC has been able to expand and diversify its sources of project



financing. Recently, NTPC has flc-aled bonds in the domestic market in three
public issues, as well as two private placements, for a total of about
Rs 16.83 billion (US$990 million at the exchange rate at the time of these
financial operations). Further data on NTPC's finances are given in Part III.
The covenanted rate of return from April 1, 1988 on historically valued fixed
assets in operation was 9-1/2 percent.  Against this, the rates of return
achieved by NTPC from FY84 to FY89 are given below:
Fiscal year                FY84    FY85    FY86   FY87    FY88    FY89
Financial rate of return 11.2    12.7    16.8   17.0    16.4    14.8
These high level of rates of return did not translate in adequate self-
financing ratios (the average for the last six years was 6.7Z), partially
because of NTPC's ambitious expansion program and partially because the actual
cash flow generated by operations was affected by poor collections, which
during the last four years have increased to levels equivalent to up to five
months of sales, above the covenanted two months ceiling. This highlights a
shortcoming of the rate of return covenant which does not differentiate
between income accrued and income actually received. Suggestions to modify
the revenue covenant were not agreed to by GOI and NTPC. To correct the
collections problem, an action plan has been drawn up in consultation with the
Bank Group.
Project Relationship
30.      Good relationships were maintained by the Bank Group with GOI, NTPC,
and other participants in the project.
Consulting Services
31.      As explained under para. 4, complete design and engineering work fo;
the project were carried out. in-house by NTPC with very limited support from
Indian consultants in a few areas. However, the Project Design Memorandum was
reviewed by a foreign consulting firm. The performance of the consultants was
satisfactory.
Procurement
32.      Bank guidelires were strictly adhered to by NTPC.  The average
procurement time per contract -- from the .ssuance of bid documents to
contract award -- was nearly one year, consisting of around 3 months for
bidding and about 7-9 months for bid evaluation. This latter time is
certainly too long and constitutes a major source of implementation delay.
However, somne progress in this regard has been made so far in subsequent
projects undertaken by NTPC (e.g. Farakka II). NTPC is in the process of
finalizing with the Bank a standard bidding document which is expected to cut
down the time lag substantially. Several contracts were amended to include
either supply or spare parts for equipment or additional quantity of material.
No significant claims were raised by bidders.
Project Documentation and Data
33.       The project's legal agreements adequately reflected the Bank Group's
interests in a satisfactory execution of the project. The staff appraisal
report was comprehensive, well prepared and provided a useful framework for
the Bank Group and NTPC during the project implementation. The Borrower
regularly submitted Quarterly Progress Reports for the project. This has been

used for planning the visits of the supervision missions to India, which often
included site visits, in addition to review meetings at NTPC Corporate Office
in New Delhi.

FARAKKA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(CREDIT 1053-IN AND LOAN 1887-IN)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A. Adequacy and Accuracy of Factual Information in Part III
1.       Part III of the PCR'prepared by the Bank includes statistical data
covering all aspects of the operation and implementation of the project.
The factual information relating to NTPC, contained in this section, have
been found to be based on the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) prepared by the
Bank for the project, discussions between Bank and NTPC during various
supervision missions and quarterly project progress reporting by NTPC.  The
information included is adequate and correct.
B. Comments on the Analysis in Part I
2.       The analysis made by the Bank under Part I is quite comprehensive
and has covered all important aspects. However, although this analysis is
generally based on factually correct infornmation, there are certain issues
which need to be examined keeping in view the background of developments as
they took place to better appreciate the events. Some of these are as
follows:
i. Procurement (reference para 10 and 32 of Part I)
3.       Since commissioning of the NTPC Power Plant units is reckoned (as
4 years for 200 MW units) from the date of award of main plant equipment
(i.e. zero date), overall delay in prcject implementation (as compared to
SAR estimates) on account of procurement delay can be largely attributed
to the delay, if any, in the award of main plant equipment.
4.        Notice Inviting Tenders (NIT) for the main plant equipment package
for this project was issued in the second week of September, 1979.
However, bids could be opened only in May, 1980 (after a period of 8 months
after NIT and 14 months after Government of India (GOI) approval for the
project), after negotiations for the financing were held. The negotiations
for the project could be held only in May 1980 on account of the
requirement of obtaining undertakings from the beneficiaries in the Eastern
Region regarding their willingness to take power in accordancp with agreed
allocations. Thus, even though advance action for procurement was taken by
issuing tenders, further action could not be taken until the completion of
negotiations.
5.       The award for main plant equipment was made in May 1981, a year
after bid opening. Nine months were taken for evaluation, longer than
normal, due to delays in receipt of certain clarifications from evaluated
bidders. The award was made after the Bank's concurrence to the award
recommendations, which took three months.



- 10 -
6.       In the context of average time taken for procurement consideration
of all packages, as mentioned in Part I of the PCR, it may be noted that
the time taken has shown a declining trend in the subsequent projects. For
Farakka II project, 53 out of 60 packages took less than 3 months from bid
invitation to opening. 39 of these packages were finally awarded in less
than 8 months from bid opening. In case of the National Capital Thermal
Power Project (NCTPP), 16 out of 24 packages took less than 3 months from
bid invitation to opening and 17 of these packages were finally awarded in
less than 8 months from bid opening. NTPC is in the process of finalizing
with the Bank a standard bidding document, which is expected to cut down
the time lag further.
ii. Financial Issues
a. Receivables (reference-para 29 of Part I)
7.       Regarding NTPC's outstanding dues against the sale of power, it
may be noted that with a view to limit the accounts receivables to a
reasonable level, a covenant was provided first in the Loan Agreement for
the Rihand Power Transmission Project and was repeated in subsequent
projects vis. the Combined Cycle Power Project, Talcher Thermal Power
Project and National Capital Thermal Power Project (NCTPP) requiring NTPC
to maintain its accounts receivables at a level not exceeding billing for
the two preceding months. The Bank is aware of NTPC's continuous efforts
to bring down the receivables. This issue was also discussed in detail
during negotiations held with the Bank in December 1989 for financing of
NTPC's Regional Power System Project. Based on these discussions, NTPC, in
consultation with GOI and the beneficiaries, has drawn up a time bound
Action Plan for liquidation of arrears and bringing down the receivables to
covenanted levels. The outstandings by end March 1990 stood at 4.6 months
of average sales. NTPC and GOI are making intensive efforts to persuade
the beneficiaries to comply with the provisions of the Action Plan. Some
of the recent developments indicate that NTPC's and GOI's efforts in this
regard are beginning to bear fruit.
b. Adequacy of Revenue Covenant (reference para 29 of Part I)
8.       For sometime now the Bank as been of the view that the revenue
covenant (requiring 9.5Z of ROR in the fiscal year beginning April 1, 1988
and thereafter agreed under this project, and subsequently modified to 7Z
in FY84/85 through FY89/90 and 9.5Z from FY90/91 to FY94/95, and a
satisfactory level thereafter) has its shortcomings. The reasons stated
are:
i)   It does not cover NTPC's present cost of capital; and
ii)   It assumes that all income is actually rece -ed (whereas there
have been outstanding dues against the benei.ciaries of NTPC
power).
9.       At the time the loan agreement for the Farakka project -as signed,
the marginal cost of funds to NTPC was 10.125Z (10S return on equity and
10.25Z interest on a loan with equity and a loan provided by GOI in the ratio
of 1:1). This was generally matching with the covenanted rate, especially
considering that equity was to be provided first before the loan component for
financing NTPC projects. As shown in Part I, NTPC's financial rate of return
had averaged 16.25Z during the last four years.



- 11 -
10.      During the recent negotiations for the Regional Power System Project,
the Bank had suggested modifications in the rate cf return covenant,
considering the present increased cost of borrowing. GOI and NTPC had
affirmed that they would endeavor to take the necessary steps to enable NTPC
to continue to earn an lIZ rate of return commencing in 1990-91.
iii. Rehabilitation of Land Oustees (reference para 13 of Part I)
12.      Regarding rehabilitation of the land oustees/affected persons due to
acquisition of land for the Farakka project, NTPC had complied with all
relevant rules/norms prevalent at that point in time. This includes payment
of mandatory compensations to the land oustees. There was no need for
constructing a dedicated colony as no homesteads were lost. Since then, in
recent years, there has been a continuously growing concern about the
rehabilitation aspects, especially of large projects. Conscious of its
responsibilities in this regard, under the Regional Power System Project,
which has recently been negotiated. NTPC has prepared an Env`.ronmental Action
Plan comprising a review of environmental and rehabilitation aspects of NTPC's
Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka projects. For Farakka, a socio-
economic study has been undertaken under the Action Plan to identify the need
for additional infrastructure in settlement areas. It has been agreed under
the Action Plan to identify the need for additional infrastructure in
settlement areas. It has been agreed that the intent of the Environmental
Action Plan is not to reopen or reconsider individual/family
rehabilitation/resettlement packages already provided to the project-affected
persons in the past. 'T'he purpose of the assessment is to determine the need
for community development assistance for the affected people.
C. Evaluation of the Bank's Performance
13.      Farakka Thermal Power Project was the fourth in the series of large
thermal power projects (Singrauli, Korba and Ramagundam being the other three
projects) and the first in the Eastern Power Region of the country taken up by
NTPC for implementation during its first phase of development. The assistance
extended by the Bank contributed substantially in bringing the project to
fruition. The project was supervised closely and an adequate number of site
visits under supervision missions were made. Excellent cooperation existed
between the Bank staff and NTPC during the implementation of the project. In
fact, this relationship continued to grow and to date the Bank group has
extended financial assistance to NTPC to the extent of nearly US$4 billion for
the implementation of 13 projects. This includes the assistance provided by
the Bank for the 2x500 MW expansion program of the Farakka project under the
Second Farakka Thermal Power Project.  NTPC's Regional Power System Project,
which includes the Farakka Stage III (1x500 MW) expansion program has been
negotiated. With the approval of assistance for this project, the Bank Group
would be involved in the total Farakka Project up to its ultimate capacity.
D. Evaluation of the Borrower's Own Performance
14.      At the time the Farakka Thermal Power Project was envisaged, it was
expected that the Project, on completion, would contribute significantly to
the easing of power shortages in the region. With the satisfactory completion
of the project, albeit with some delays, NTPC has been able to achieve this
main objective as the generating performance of the units at this station has
been satisfactory and the power station is supplying much needed electricity
to the Easterr. Region, which continues to suffer from peaking as well as
energy shortages. The project has also contributed to the overall development
of the area.



- 12 -
15.      Right from inception, NTPC.had adopted as an organizational objective
achievement of self sufficiency in the design and engineering of large thermal
power stations and high voltage transmission lines. With the experience
gained in the earlier Singrauli, Korba and Ramagundam projects, NTPC neared
this goal in the Farakka project.  For the first time, entire design and
engineering for this project were successfully done by NTPC in-house with very
limited support from consultants.
16.      It has been recognized that NTPC has set for itself a tight time
schedule of commissioning 200 MW units within 4 years from the date of order
of the main plant equipment.  To achieve this objective, NTPC had also
developed and applied its Integrated Project Management and Control System
(IPMCS) in its projects. While the use of the project management system and
close monitoring had assisted NTPC in commissioning its units in other
projects either on time or, in some cases, even ahead of schedule, in the case
of the Farakka power project, even though the proven project management system
was adopted and critical contracts wore awarded to experienced contractors who
had carried out similar jobs in other projects, there were delays in
commissioning of the units due to reasons beyond the control of NTPC.  The
delay was caused by contractors' industrial relations problems, including the
law and order situation in nearby areas and frequent interruptions in the
power supply.  NTPC had taken every effort at all levels to contain this
situation.  In spite of all the timely efforts taken by NTPC, the progress of
the project was adversely affected.  On the technical side, NTPC had taken
care to provide for contingency arrangements, keeping in view the possible
delay in the readiness of the main coal handling plant.
17.      With the completion of the project and with NTPC staff operating the
commissioned units now, it has been possible for the organization to bring
about a change for the better in the industrial relations climate in the area.
Having gained experience in the handling of such industrial relations
situations (through the contractors' problems), it has been possible for NTPC
to avoid such major adverse situations in the implementation of the ongoing
Farakka expansion stage project.
18.      NTPC has recognized training, both managerial and technical training,
as one of the most important aspects of organizational development.  it is
significant that the Farakka power project assisted by the Bank includes
procurement of a full scope 500 MW thermal power plant training simulator.
There already exists at NTPC's Korba site a 200 MW training simulator. This
equipment simulates actual operating conditions and is very useful for
training power plant operators and technicians.

B. Economic Impact
(1)      In the appraisal report, the return on investment was calculated for
the full Farakka program at the time of appraisal of 1,190 MW generating
capacity to demonstrate the relationship between tariffs and the economic cost
of the development. It was defined as the discount rate at which the present
worth of the economic cost associated with the development equals the present
worth of the economic benefits over the life cycle of the development. The
measurable costs included:
(a) capital and labor costs involved in the development of generation and
tran._..ission facilities.
(b) the annual operation and maintenance costs; and
(c) fuel costs.
The benefits were measured in terms of the revenues to be derived from the
sale of electricity.
(2)      Based on measurable economic costs and benefits associated with the
1,100 MW development, the ex-ante internal economic rate of return (IERR) was
estimated at about 132. Actual tariffs hav3 been higher than those envisaged
and this has more than compensated for a higher project cost and longer
construction period. The same approach results in an ex-post IERR of about
191 for the 600 MW development (Annex 1) which compares favorably with
opportunity cost of capital, implying the NTPC's bulk supply tariffs for the
Eastern Region continue to adequately reflect the economic cost of supply.

C. Financial Impact
(1)      As per the agreement, NTPC was to sell power from the projec  to SEBs
in the Eastern Region 1/ under bulk supply contracts satisfactory to the Bank
Group and GOI was to ensure that all necessary steps were taken to obtain an
undertaking from respective State Governments to purchase, in the aggregate.
not less than 85Z 2/ of the output of power from the Project. GOI and NTPC
have complied with their commitment despite an initial delay in the signing of
the bulk supply contracts. NTPC's operating and financial performance,
however, was not adversely affected by this delay.
(2)      NTPC's actual and project financial statements for the period
FY83-FY89 are presented in Annexes 2 to 4. The most salient feature of NTPC's
operations during the period FY84-FY88 is the spectacular growth the
corporation experienced. While net fixed assets in operation has increased
4.62 times, sales of electricity increased by more than 6 times. Even more
striking is the high level of investment in projects under construction.
Work-in-progress at the end of the period was almost 1.37 times that of assets
in operation. This reflects the continuation of a highly accelerated
expansion program which, in turn, explains why the self-financing ratio
remained modest during the period, representing only 6.7Z of the total
financing requirements, despite the reasonable rates of return achieved
(around 161 in the last three years, well in excess of those projected in the
appraisal reports, and much higher than the 9.5% requial, under the loan as a
target for FY89). Debt service coverage was very cnomf3;-able during the
period because repayment of debt started only in FYeg. Surrent ratio, which
was below one during the earlier part of the period '          r.,>-7ed to 1.8 by FY89.
However, a closer look at thc working capital posit:;r  *~f NTPC reveals,
starting in FY83, a very unsatisfactorv collection 'r  K-:nance.  Under recent
loans, a covenant was introduced that req4uires that NP.    receivables should
not exceed the equivalent of two m.ithb of sales.  Howe%.!r, despite its best
efforts, NTPC has not 1'een able t: achieve this covenarn , target.  The GOI,
Bank and NTPC have agreed on a set of actions that are e p'ected to correct the
situation.  Satisfactory first steps of this action plar.   a condition for
the presentation to the Board of thL proposed Regional P   r Systems Project,
which would cover NTPC's further investments.  The follow  g table represents
the key operational results forecast in the appraisal rep rt compared with
actuals:
1/  Power from the Project was to be solu in bulk to the State Electricity
Boards of Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa and the Damodar Valley
Corporation.
2/ The remaining 15Z was to be sold in accordance with priorities to be
determined by CEA.

(3)       The Appraisal Reports' financial forecasts anticipated that NTPC
would eventually achieve and maintain from FY89 onwards (the first year in
which the 2,000 MW Singrauli power station was expected to be in full
commercial operation) a rate of return of not less than 9.5Z on the original
cost of its average net fixed assets in service. As shown above, actual rates
of return were considerably higher than forecast. This was partly because of
the introduction of higher than forecast tariffs (see table below), and partly
due to better operation performance including higher than expected plant load
factor achieved at NTPC stations than the targets set in the appraisal report.
NTPC's average plant load factor increased from 582 in FY85 to about 74Z in
FY86, to 79.6% in FY87 and 75.6% in FY88 at the Ramagundam, Korba, Farakka and
Singrauli power stations. The early stabilization of the Ramagundam 200 MW
units, increased availability of the Singrauli units (both 200 and 500 MW) and
a sustained high level of performance of Korba units (both 200 and 500 MW),
were the main reasons for this performance.

(4)      During the FY85-FY89 period, NTPC financed 572 of its rapid growth by
borrowing. GOI financed about 53Z of NTPC's total requirements, two-thirds of
it through equity contributions and the balance as loans. This denotes a
heavy reliance on GOI support, which during NTPC's initial period of growth
was a sound policy. The Bank Group has financed approximately Rs 18.37
billion, or nearly one-fifth of NTPC's total financial requirements over the
past five years. GOI's loans have a total maturity of 20 years, including 5
years of grace and an interest rate which has changed over time and currently
is 152 p.a. It is worth noting that NTPC has floated bonds in the domestic
market in three public issues, as well as two private placements, for a total
of about Rs 16.83 billion (US$990 million at the current exchange rate), which
helped to finance about 212 of NTPC's total investment in the past five years.
The latest issue included two types of bonds: one carries a 132 p.a. rate of
interest and a maturity of 7 years; the other pays 9Z p.a., tax free, and is
redeemable in 10 years. In addition, NTPC has raised funds in Japan through a
syndicate of banks and financial institutions. Finally, NTPC has received
financing directly or through GOI, from the OPEC Fund, the Saudi Fund, the
Governments of the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom, the Soviet
Union, Sweden, France, Norway, Italy and most recently, untied funds from
Japan. In FY88, NTPC completed two interest rate swaps from fixed to floating
interest rates. GOI's policy requires a return of not less than 102 on NTPC's
equity. However, this return on equity has thus far not been translated into
dividend payments and the totality of NTPC's profits has been retained in the
Corporation to help finance its large expansion program. This policy will be
maintained in the foreseeable future.
