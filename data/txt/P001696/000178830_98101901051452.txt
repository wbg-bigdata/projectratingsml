PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALI
SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT - CREDIT 383-MLI
and
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT - CREDIT 599-MlI
Preface
The following are project completion reports on two highway
projects in Mali, the Second Highway Project, approved in April 1973
(Credit 383-MLI, US$9.5 m originally, credit amount increased to
US$17.8 m in June 1975) and the Third Highway Project, approved in
December 1975. (Credit 599-MII, US$10.0 m).
On completion of the Second Highway Project, it had originally
been envisaged to keep undisbursed funds, over US$1 million, as a reserve
against outstanding contractor's claims. Subsequently, the Government
informed the Bank that any payments on claims would be settled with Mali's
own funds; at Government's request, US$1,040,000 were reallocated to
finance maintenance equipment. The closing date was postponed to March 31,
1983. As of May 16, 1983, US$43,000 remained undisbursed.
The two Project Completion Reports were prepared by the West
Africa Region based on consultant, Government and Bank reports, and infor-
mation collected by final supervision missions in January 1981 (Credit 383)
and June 1980 (Credit 599). The assistance of the Government and the
Ministry of Transport, in particular, is gratefully acknowledged.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, these Completion Reports were read by the Operations Evaluation
Department but the projects were not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Reports were sent to the Borrower; however, no comments were received.

Highlights
A country-wide transport survey financed in 1967-69 by the United
Nations Development Programme with the Bank acting as executing agency laid
down the framework for a strategy in the road subsector. This survey con-
cluded that, with the exception of a few trunk roads requiring rehabilita-
tion/reconstruction, the main sector needs were improving highway maintenance
and building feeder roads. The two highway projects subject of this audit,
as well as the First Project, and the Fourth Project (currently underway)
were framed in the survey's recommendations.
The main physical components of the Second Project were the improve-
ment of two paved roads, Bamako-Bougouni (155 km) and Faladie-Segou (223 km),
continuation of highway maintenance and feeder road betterment program,
procurement of highway maintenance equipment and studies; the main components
of the Third Project were the improvement of 1,200 km of feeder roads, in-
cluding provision of two ferries, a program to eliminate backlog maintenance
on 944 km of paved roads, assistance to a Training Center established in the
previous project, and preparation of a national transport plan.
During implementation, the two projects had to be reduced in scope
due to cost overruns stemming from bids significantly higher than expected
during a period of high world-wide inflation in the Second Project and to
delays in implementation, mainly due to slowness in Government procedures
coupled with high inflation, in the Third Project. The main changes were de-
letion of the USAID-financed Bamako-Bougouni Road (lowest bid was US$18.7 m
compared to a US$4.6 m estimate) from the Second Project and reduced number
of kilometers executed in the Third Project, 856 km instead of 1200 km of
feeder roads and 250 km of backlog maititenance instead of 944 km. Had the
projects been executed as originally envisaged, there would have been a cost
overrun of 105% in the Second and 40% in the Third.
Other important highlights are:
In the Second Project:
-    The creation of a domestic training center in sub-
stitution for fellowships abroad (paras. 3.06 and
3.16), which was later assisted also under the Third
Project. While the training of Malian staff actually
carried out during the initial operation period of
the center fell substantially short of expectations
(paras. 3.10 and 3.11 of Third Project), the center
should in the long run greatly contribute to the
development of the institutional capacity of the
Ministry of Works; the importance of the center is
further enhanced by the use of Malian instructors
(para. 4.02).



- vii -
While the Government met most of the covenants, it
failed to provide the funds it agreed to for highway
maintenance. This was due largely to the fact that
fuel taxes, the main source of the Road Fund, were
more and more frequently paid with checks drawn on
the Postal Checking System (PCS), which was basically
insolvent. Suppliers of spare parts became increasing-
ly unwilling to accept postal checks and road mainte-
nance deteriorated considerably as the Ministry of
Works became short of equipment and of operating in-
puts (paras. 3.23 - 3.25).
As a result of cost being double the original estimate,
without a parallel adjustment in benefits, the con-
struction of the Faladie-Segou Road had an economic
rate of return of 15%, about 50% below the appraisal
estimate, but still fully satisfactory (paras. 5.06,
5.07).
In the Third Project:
-    The problems encountered with highway maintenance
financing and the postal checking system in the
Second Project remained virtually unchanged during
the Third; the problem was further compounded
because a large part of the Road Fund's liquid re-
sources was used as the Malian contribution to sub-
stantial, mainly foreign-financed road investments
(paras. 4.01, 4.02).
-    The Government was slow in signing contracts for
technical assistance and in appointing trainees
(para. 4.04).
-    The preparation of the National Transport Plan study
left much to be desired; it had a cumbersome pre-
sentation and lacked unity (partly the result that
it was carried out by French, German and Malian per-
sonnel, inadequately coordinated), was very descrip-
tive and had little straightforward economic analysis
or consistent conclusions and recommendations. Large-
ly reflecting Government's objectives and priorities,
it proposed unrealistically high road investments,
unsupported by economic analysis and in clear conflict
with available and potential financial resources
(paras. 3.12, 3.13).
-    Overall, the feeder roads had a lower economic return
than expected at appraisal, but were still satisfac-
tory; the roads in the cotton-growing area had better
returns than expected, while those in the groundnut-
raising area were only marginal. As had been expected,
the road maintenance component had a high return of
about 50% (paras. 5.04 and 5.08).



MALI
SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT - CREDIT 383-MLI
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Landlocked Mali covers about 1.24 million km2, with 90% of its 6.3
million population living in rural areas. The country has a simple transport
system which provides minimum transport facilities to most areas of the
country, with road and rail being by far the most important modes. At the end
of 1980 the classified road network comprised about 14,200 km of roads and
tracks, of which only about 3,300 km (including 1,670 km of paved roads)
provided all-weather service; an additional 1,300 km were non-classified. It
is estimated that 750 km of earth roads will be upgraded to paved standards
within the next five years. The Malian Railway extends 640 km from Koulikoro,
57 km east of Bamako, via Kayes to the Senegalese border where it joins the
Senegalese Railway leading to the ocean port of Dakar; the total distance by
rail to this port is 1,285 km. River transport on the two major rivers
crossing the country, the Niger and the Senegal, is limited by poor navigation
conditions, making it usable only seven months of the year. Air transport is
served by international airports at Bamako and Gao, and several small air-
fields open to domestic traffic.
1.02      The Bank Group-s involvement in the transport sector began prior
to independence when what was to become the Malian Railway benefited in part
from a US$7.5 million loan (Loan 100-FR) granted to the French agency managing
the railways in Francophone West Africa. Since independence in 1960, the Bank
Group has financed three railway projects totaling US$26.3 million, four
highway projects totaling US$52.5 million for strengthening and maintaining
the primary and secondary road networks, and the construction and improvement
of about 1,300 km of feeder roads. The first financing agreement in the
transport sector (First Railway Project, Credit 95-MLI, US$9.1 million)
was signed in 1966 and the first Credit for a highway project (Highway Mainte-
nance Project, subsequently referred to as First Highway Project, Credit
197-MLI, US$7.7 million) was signed in June 1970. Credits for the Second and
Third Highway Projects and for a Road Maintenance Project (Fourth Highway
Project) were signed in May 1973, January 1976, and March 1981 respectively.
1.03      A countrywide transport survey financed in 1967-69 by the United
Nations Development Programme with the Bank acting as executing agency laid
down the framework for a strategy in the road sub-sector. The survey con-
cluded that, with the exception of a few trunk roads, the main road system
could serve the transport needs of the country without heavy investment, but
that highway maintenance needed to be improved and feeder roads constructed.
As recommended by the above survey, the Directorate of Public Works (DPW)
prepared a highway maintenance and feeder road program which formed the basis
for the above IDA-financed First Highway Project. Also, the three subsequent
IDA highway projects have been aimed at these same objectives.



- 2 -
1.04      The technical assistance and training'part of the First Highway
Project was reasonably successful to the extent that it contributed to the
reorganization and strengthening of the country's DPW. A serious shortfall in
available local funds prevented expectations of improved highway maintenance
from being met fully, and only 470 km of the programmed 1,450 km betterment of
feeder roads were completed (Project Performance Audit Report No. 1913 dated
February 16, 1978). IDA continued to participate in the financing of technical
assistance and training under the Second Highway Project, the subject of this
report, and under the Third Highway Project (Credit 599-MLI dated January 9,
1976) which also included a feeder road program. The Road Maintenance Project
(Credit 1104-MLI dated March 11, 1981) continues to emphasize maintenance of
the road system.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      The First Highway Project included feasibility and detailed engineer-
ing studies for Mali½s two oldest paved main trunk roads, built in the early
fifties, which link the capital Bamako with Bougouni to the south and with
Segou to the northeast. The feasibility study and preliminary engineering
were completed in February 1972 but due to staffing difficulties and delays in
soil testing, the final engineering and preparation of bidding documents were
not completed until March 1973. Originally improvement works on these two
roads comprised the major elements of the Second Highway Project; technical
assistance for road maintenance and procurement of road maintenance equipment
were also included.    Later, the Government requested that the project include
detailed engineering for improving the Dioila-Sikasso (180 km) and Kati-Kolokani
(105 km) Roads-for which feasibility studies were being carried out with
Government financing. Subsequently the Association determined that the former
road was not economically feasible, while the latter was included in the
project and extended to cover the sectiQn Bamako-Kati (10 km).
2.02      During project preparation and appraisal, the Association informed
the Government that review of the road transport industry had indicated the
desirability of investigating the adequacy of the policy for road freight
services. One issue of concern was the official ceiling price for road freight
transport which, unchanged since 1967, appeared insufficient to cover total
transport costs. At negotiations, the Government agreed: (a) to include a
trucking industry study in the project which would define measures aimed at
improving the efficiency of road transport, review transport tariffs, and
propose an implementation schedule for increased transport tariffs; and (b) to
implement the study recommendations.
2.03      The Government also requested that the Association finance an
additional tranche of road maintenance equipment to replace USSR-made equipment
which, in addition to being old, could not be repaired or maintained because
spare parts were not available. After a review of the Government's estimates
of equipment needs, the Association agreed to finance under the project the
foreign cost of equipment which could not be covered by the envisaged USAID
parallel co-financing of the project (para. 2.05). Negotiations began in
Washington on February 26, 1973 and were substantially completed in three days
since no major issues were to be settled. The agreed project included the
following items:



- 3 -
(a)  improvement of the Bamako-Faladie-Bougouni Road (about 155 ki);
(b)  improvement of the Faladie-Segou Road (about 223 kmn);
(c)  continuation of the ongoing highway maintenance and feeder road
betterment program, with supplementary technical assistance and
training;
(d)  procurement of equipment fQr highway maintenance;
(e)  detailed engineering by consultants for upgrading of the Bamako-
Kolokani Road (120 km); and
(f)  a study of the trucking industry.
2.04      The total cost of the project as described above was at the time of
appraisal estimated at US$20.5 million equivalent, of which US$5.8 million was
to be local cost (about 70% taxes) and US$14.7 million foreign cost. A

As indicated, IDA and USAID were to finance all foreign and a considerable
amount of local cost, other than taxes.
2.06      The Government and the Association persuaded USAID to increase the
amount of its loan from the initially envisaged US$6.6 million to US$9
million to cover costs of additional maintenance equipment to be procured in
the US and spare parts for existing and new US equipment.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness and Start-Up
3.01     The Credit Agreement was signed May 23, 1973.   Although August 20, 1973
was set as the target date for Credit effectiveness for which there were no
special conditions, the Credit was declared effective on September 12, 1973.
The first action was the selection of consultants for supervision of the road
construction for which bids were expected to be called in mid-1973. Four
consulting firms were invited to submit proposals; three were received. The
Government recommended signing a contract with a US firm. Following the
Associations's concurrence, the Government signed the contract for supervision,
but not until July 1974 for the reasons set forth below.
3.02     A major difficulty in the start-up period was the delay in prepara-
tion of the engineering studies for the Faladie-Segou and Bamako-Faladie-
Bougouni Roads. The consultants financed under the First Highway Project
should have submitted the final engineering and bidding documents for both
the Faladie-Segou and the Bamako-Faladie-Bougouni Roads by February 1972,
according to their contract. After several contract extensions and delays,
however, the Government received the final documents only in September 1973,
This circumstance, and the less than adequate standard of the documents sub-
mitted, 1/ prompted the Government (with the Association's agreement) to
request the US firm selected for construction supervision to review and complete
the bidding documents under a contract financed with the Government's own funds.
3.03     The postponement in finalizing the engineering study of the two roads
had an important impact on project performance. Whereas bids were expected to
be called in June 1973, they were received one year later, in May 1974 when
the full impact of rampant inflation, which began in late 1973, affected the
offers (paras. 3.05 and 3.06).
Revisions of the Project and the Credit Amount
3.04     When bids for the Bamako-Bougouni Road were opened in May 1974,
the lowest bid, namely US$18.7 million, proved to be four times the US$4.6
million estimate, including taxes but excluding contingencies. This bid
figure could be partly explained by the inflation which set in after appraisal
and the technical difficulties encountered by the project. One other reason
may be that, because of USAID's parallel financing, bidding was restricted
to US contractors which reduced competition and the bidders, having had little
experience with executing works in French-speaking West Africa, showed high
risk aversion. When negotiations with the lowest bidder to reduce his bid
failed, the Bamako-Bougouni Road was eliminated from the Project and USAID
cancelled US$5.75 million from the US$9 million loan; the balance was allocated
for US equipment, spare parts and training. Subsequently, the US granted an
additional amount of US$400,000 from the Sahel fund for improvement of a
bridge on the Boug6uni Road excluded from the project.
1/   Deficiencies involved lack of geotechnical data, inadequacy of some
technical solutions proposed for pavement strengthening, incompleteness
of bidding documents and discrepancies between such documents.



-6-
3.05      When, in May 1974, bids were opened for the Faladie-Segou Road to
be financed by IDA, the lowest bid was MF 5.3 billion (US$11.8 million
equivalent) or 66% higher than the MF 3.2 billion (US$6.9 million) appraisal
estimate (excluding contingencies). Although 29 contractors were prequalified,
only five participated in the bidding. Nonetheless, the Association,
satisfied that adequate competition had taken place, agreed to the Government's
proposal to award the contract to the low bidder (a German firm) and gave
consideration to financing its share of the cost overrun of the project,
estimated at US$8.3 million. Credit 383-MLI for the Second Highway Project
was amended accordingly by increasing its amount from US$9.5 million to
US$17.8 million in June 1975. In the meantime, in October 1974 the Govern-
ment awarded the contract for MF 5.3 billion. Works were to be completed by
April 1977 under the supervision of the US consultants.
3.06      In June 1974, the Government proposed to use Credit funds originally
intended for fellowships abroad (US$50,000) for financing the creation of a
permanent training center for road maintenance personnel. The Government
indicated that the International Labour Office (ILO) had requested that at
least 20 participants be designated to attend a special course for Malian
personnel at a cost of US$120,000. The Government pointed out that it pre-
ferred a practical training approach which would better suit the operations of
Malian technical services and proposed the change. The Association approved
the Government request.
Reconstruction of the Faladie-Segou Road
3.07      This major item of the project was plagued from the beginning with a
number of setbacks which caused a three-year delay in completion.     The more
important causes of the delay were the following:
(a)  The consultants responsible for detailed engineering under
the First Highway Project did not respect the completion date
stipulated in their contract and produced incomplete documents
with some inadequate technical solutions, thus necessitating
review and correction in the bidding documents by the consulting
engineers responsible for supervision of the works; this process
caused a delay in award of contract of about one year (para. 3.03).
(b)  As a consequence of the rapid deterioration of the road, soon
after the contractor's mobilization the decision was made to
extend reinforcement of the foundation courses to the entire
length of the road (223 km), rather than over 60% as originally
planned. The contractor agreed to the changes in quantities
and with the Association's concurrence, Contract Amendment No. 1
was signed May 20, 1975 increasing the contract amount by 17%
to MF 6.2 billion (US$14.8 million) and extending the construc-
tion time by three months to July 1977. Credit funds were then
increased in June 1975 to cover the Association's share of the
cost overrun (para. 3.05).
(c)  The level of cooperation between the contractor's project manager
and the consultant's resident engineer was less than satisfactory
thus leading to their eventual replacement.



- 7 -
(d)  The contractor was requested to keep in place the existing pavement
and to add layers to strengthen and widen it, as well as correct the
cross sections and vertical alignments with only minimal volumes of
earth works, but nevertheless with strict geometric specifications.
Working with such minimal volumes of earthworks proved, however, to
be impractical. Consequently the concept of the reinforcement works
was changed by the consultant-s replacement resident engineer: he
decided to use the existing pavement as material for a sub-base
course by scarifying and recompacting it with adequate profile and
to apply on top a 15cm base course of quarry material and a double
surface treatment. This procedure simplified the works considerably,
permitting the contractor's higher productivity and leading to the
signature of Contract Amendment No. 2 in April 1977, which extended
the completion date another 21 months to April 1979 and increased
the cost to MF 7.2 billion (US$17.0 million) or 36% over the original
contract. Under that amendment the contractor renounced all previous
claims which had accumulated to some US$3.8 million.
3.08      Most of the contractor's equipment had arrived in April 1975 but
because of the above events he was slow in starting the disputed works.
At the end of 17 months (through September 1976), after two dry working
seasons, only about 15% of the works were completed. However, after Amend-
ment No. 2 was signed and the contractor had appointed a new project manager,
operations went smoothly. After extending the completion date another month
to carry out some additional work requested by the Government, the works were
completed and provisionally accepted May 28, 1979.
3.09      After completion of works the contractor presented a series of 15 claims
totaling about MF 3.3 billion (US$7.8 million, representing an addition of about
36% to the construction cost of MF 9.0 billion (US$20.4 million) including price
escalations of MF 598 million and taxes. The Government, assisted by the con-
sultant, has so far accepted but not yet paid claims for MF 263 million
(US$0.6 million). Dissatisfied with this proposed settlement, the contractor
has decided to go to arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce in
Paris. The arbitration process may take anywhere from a few months to two
years or more.
Continuation of the Program for Road Maintenance and Feeder Road Betterment
3.10      The road maintenance and feeder road betterment programs were
implemented under the First Highway Project at a slower pace than envisaged at
the time that project was appraised (para. 1.04). In fact, serious efforts to
improve maintenance operations only started in late 1973 after the credit for
the Second Highway Project was already signed. Also the Feeder Road Betterment
Program included in the First Highway Project had a lower output than expected,
namely only 470 km instead of 1,450 km. Therefore, technical assistance
provided to DPW under the First Highway Project was extended under the Second
Highway Project. To ensure that the objectives of both projects were achieved,
amendments to ongoing contracts extended the technical assistance to DPW by the ILO



-8-
to DPW by the ILO with 120 man-months to assist in the reorganization
of the Equipment Service, and by French consultants with
65 man-months for the improvement of road maintenance operations. These
consultants completed their extended services respectively in June 1974 and
June 1975; however, the French consultant's team remained in the field to
provide additional services under the Third Highway Project. When this
technical assistance ended, the feeder road brigades were able to continue
work on their own satisfactorily. Road maintenance operations improved
through 1974, but the decline in resources for current expend.tures in the
following years (para. 3.25) resulted in reduced maintenance activities.
Procurement of Road Maintenance Equipment
3.11      The road maintenance equipment provided under the project was
procured through international competitive bidding. The specifications and
bidding documents had been prepared by DPW with assistance from ILO's tech-
nical assistance team. The Government's evaluation of bids and contract
proposals were approved by the Association in January 1974. This project
component did not present any particular problem and delivery was
completed by June 1975 at a cost in accordance with the estimates,
including price contingency.
Detailed Engineering for the Bamako-Kati-Kolokani Road
3.12      A preliminary study of the Kati-Kolokani Road (105 km) was carried
out in 1971 by a Mali-France joint venture of consulting firms, with Govern-
ment financing. The study recommended upgrading the gravel road to paved
standards around 1975; the rate of return was estimated at 14%. A Bank mission
which visited Mali in April 1973 determined that it would be advantageous to
study also the link of Kati with the urban network of Bamako (10 km), and the
Government requested the addition of a feasibility study and engineering
for this section to the project.
3.13      A contract for the Bamako-Kolokani study was signed in September
1973 with the joint venture which had carried out the preliminary study.
Including a two-month extension granted later, the contractual period for the
study expired in March 1975. The consultants submitted a preliminary report
on the feasibility of the Bamako-Kati section in mid-1974, followed by a final
report dated March 1975 for the full length of the road. The second report
had not, however, taken into account various comments made jointly by the
Government and the Association, and the consultants were requested to review
their report. An amended final report was finally issued in April 1977, a
delay of about two years. The improvement of the Kolokani Road has been
postponed and the Government used the funds intended for the Kolokani Road to
cover the cost overrun of the Second Highway Project. Priority consideration
has been given to including the improvement of the Bougouni rather than the
Kolokani Road in an IDA Highway Project.

Study of the Trucking Industry
3.14      This study, for which outline terms of reference had been agreed
during negotiations in February 1973, was completed in April 1977 when
the consultants submitted the final volume of their report. Reasons for the
long duration were: the Ministry of Transport's (MT) lack of familiarity with
Bank Group procedures regarding the utilization of consultants and deadline
extensions required by the consultants. Although the Association had some
doubts that the Belgian consultant chosen by the Government had submitted the
best technical offer, it accepted the Government's proposal to award the
contract to this firm, which on the basis of its general reputation could be
expected to do a satisfactory job. The draft contract was received and
approved by the Association in July 1975 and was signed in November 1975.
Field work was completed by March 1976 according to schedule, despite the
fact that the consultant had experienced some personnel problems. The draft
report was due in July 1976 but, at the consultant's request, the Government
agreed to extend its completion date by two months. The consultant finally
submitted the report in several volumes between December 1976 and April 1977,
and the Association received a copy in May 1977.
3.15       The main findings and recommendations of the report were that:
(a) tariffs for transportation of goods were inadequate and should be
increased; (b) the small truck fleet was aging and should be partly renewed;
and (c) storage facilities for the State marketing companies should be
expanded. Although the forecasts of agricultural production for the years
1978 and 1981 appeared unrealistically high, the report's recommendation to
revise transport tariffs was useful. The Government increased the tariffs in
1977 and hired consultants with its own funds to help implement other report
recommendations which were addressed to improving operations of the State-
owned Office National des Transports, the regulatory agency for road transport
in Mali. Owing to a shortage of funds, however, the consultants' contract was
cancelled after a few months and thus little progress has been achieved.
Construction of a Training Center (CPTP)
3.16      Following the Association-s approval to substitute creation of a
domestic training center for fellowships abroad (para. 3.06), the Government
called for locally advertised bids in September 1975 to build the nucleus of a
permanent training center for DPW personnel. Some classrooms, a library, a
workshop and an office for the director were completed by September 1976. In
December 1977, the Government requested and the Association agreed to use the
balance left in the credit account earmarked for training to improve the older
buildings. In June 1979, the Government launched a local call for bids to
build an enclosing wall, a store and some ancilliary facilities. The ensuing
contract was cancelled, however, because of the contractor's default to start
the works. Subsequently, the Government negotiated a new contract with the
second lowest evaluated bidder and the works were finally completed by May
1981 (para. 3.21).

Implementation Schedule
3.17      Despite the Government's and the Association's efforts to solve
the problems connected with the reconstruction of the Faladie-Segou Road
(paras. 3.07-3.09), this project element was completed about three years
behind the appraisal schedule (Table 2). The implementation of the other
project elements took second place behind the solving of this overriding
implementation problem. Although the Government began implementing the
study of the Bamako-Kolokani Road and the study of the trucking industry
expeditiously, it soon lost momentum during project execution because all
its efforts were concentrated on speeding up the reconstruction of the
Faladie-Segou Road. The same is true for the Bank-s supervision missions,
which spent most of their time in the country solving the intricate technical
problems of this road construction and in settling disputes between the
Government, represented by the supervising consultants, and the contractor.
The final works under the project were completed in May 1981, although it had
been expected that the project would be completed in late 1976.
Costs
3.18      At the time of appraisal the total cost of the components to which
IDA contributed was estimated at US$11.8 million equivalent, including taxes
(Table 3). By May 1981 the actual cost amounted to about US$24.2 million
equivalent, including taxes, or 105% above the estimate. Virtually the entire
cost overrun can be attributed to the road construction element and the need
to extend supervision of works because of the delays. The major causes of the
overrun were: (a) world-wide inflation which accelerated dramatically between
the time cost estimates were prepared (December 1972) and the completion of
construction (May 1979); and (b) the quality increase following the decision
to reinforce the road foundation over its'entire length instead of limiting it
to 60% (para. 3.07). The incidence of inflation accounted for about 80% of
the cost overrun; the quantity increase was responsible for the other 20%.
Performance of Consultants
3.19      Consultant   services were used under the project to: (a) supervise
road reconstruction works; (b) provide extended technical assistance to DPW;
(c) prepare technical studies for the Bamako-Kolokani Road; and (d) analyze
the trucking industry and make recommendations for improvements. Consul-
tants performed satisfactorily, although the trucking industry study and the
studies for the Bamako-Kolokani Road were completed behind schedule. Coopera-
tion between the first resident engineer of the consulting firm for supervision
of road reconstruction and the contractor was inadequate during the first
eighteen months of the works. The resident engineer was inflexible in apply-
ing the contract specifications, even when they were technically not realistic.
Relations improved after the contractor replaced his project manager and the
consultant appointed a new resident engineer who changed the design which
facilitated the contractor's work.



Performance of Contractors
3.20      The German contractor for reconstruction of the Faladie-Segou Road,
implemented the works slowly initially because of insufficient equipment and
the lack of a well prepared working plan and schedule. When the works were
already more than one year behind schedule, in June 1976, the contractor
blamed for the slow progress both the rigidity of the supervising consultant
and the uncertainty in the scope of work which, at the time, had not been as
yet properly defined. The situation changed for the better after Amendment
No. 2 was negotiated at the end of 1976 when the nature of the works were
adapted through more realistic design (para. 3.07 sub (d)). The rate of
construction was greatly increased and works were completed only 17 days after
the extended contractual completion date.
3.21      Contracts for construction of the training center were awarded to
domestic contractors following locally advertised calls for bids. The first
tranche of works was completed with a six-month delay. The contractor for the
second tranche never started the works because of lack of funds. After some
months, the Government cancelled this contract, collected the contractor-s
performance bond and awarded a new contract to the second lowest evaluated
bidder who started work in January 1980 and completed it by May 1981.
Performance of the Borrower
3.22      The Government followed as closely as possible the implementation
of the amended project. One of the best DPW engineers was assigned to the
supervision of road construction and the supervising consultant often acknowl-
edged this engineer's contribution to the progress of works. The Government s
technical competence during implementation and the overall control exercised
on the project were, in general, satisfactory. With regard to the studies
the Government made a good start but because of other pressing priorities,
subsequently lagged in the follow-up work. As a result, target dates for
submission of reports were greatly exceeded.
3.23      The Government's performance in observing covenants included in the
Credit Agreement was mixed. Records of operations and expenditures regarding
the project were adequately maintained (CA Article IV, Section 4.01). Data
collection for the planning of maintenance, improvement and extension of the
road network was reasonable (CA Article IV, Section 4.02). Adjustments in
road freight tariffs recommended by the trucking industry study were implemented
(CA Article IV, Section 4.06). However, the control of vehicle axle loads
(CA Article IV, Section 4.03), could not be implemented because the necessary
equipment was not available.
3.24      The Government undertook also to:    (a) maintain adequately the road
network and provide the required funds for this task (CA, Article IV, Section
4.04); (b) manage efficiently the Road Fund, and allocate to it amounts
sufficient to cover road expenditures (CA, Article IV, Section 4.05). At
negotiations the Government and the Association agreed on amounts to be
budgeted for road maintenance and equipment renewal. Inability to fulfill



-12 -
these obligations, however, caused major shortcomings in Government perfor-
mance. The amounts spent on road maintenance were generally lower than
those agreed upon, as shown in the following table:
Amounts for Road Maintenance
(in millions of MF at current prices)
Year                                1974    1975     1976    1977    1978
Agreed at negotiations              1,024   1,171    1,317   1,466   1,525
Budgeted                            1,188     700      660     961   1,669
Spent                               1,282     841      730     961   1,519
In real terms, the shortfalls were even greater than shown in the above
table because of inflation after 1973, which could not be envisaged at
negotiations. Of MF 1,610 million (US$3.7 million) to be spent for equipment
renewal during 1974-1978 as agreed during negotiations, only MF 516 million
(US$1.2 million) was spent by May 1980. This amount was satisfactory, never-
theless, because an estimated US$3.25 million expended on equipment, spare
parts and training was supplied by USAID under Loan 625-H-007 (para. 3.04),
which is more than double the amount envisaged at the time of appraisal.
3.25      For the most part the rapid   decline  in  resources for road
maintenance expenditures following 1974 was caused by the development of
peculiar financial circumstances affecting the Road Fund. 1/     Fuel taxes,
the main source of Road Fund revenues were more and more frequently paid
with checks drawn on the Postal Checking System (PCS) which, however, was
experiencing increasing difficulty in remaining solvent. As of June 1974
the Banque de Developpement du Mali (BDM), where the Road Fund account was
held, no longer accepted postal checks for deposit and therefore DPW was
forced to open an account for the Road Fund at the Postal Service itself
for the processing of postal checks. Eventually, suppliers of spare parts
became unwilling to accept postal checks and road maintenance deteriorated
considerably. Rehabilitation of PCS' finances is currently a major monetary
policy objective of the Government.
Disbursements
3.26      The unexpected inflationary period during project execution and
the signing of the supplementary credit agreement in June 1975 make a mean-
ingful comparison of actual disbursements with appraisal estimates difficult.
Nevertheless, a partial comparison of disbursements effected before June
1975 and the delayed completion of road reconstruction in May 1979 instead of
1/   The Road Fund was reorganized in 1971 mainly to finance the maintenance
and development of the road network.



-13-
by December 1976 indicate that disbursements lagged much behind schedule.
Table 4 shows that IDA had disbursed, as of March 31, 1981, about US$16.7
million or 94% of the US$17.8 million Credit. As mentioned in para. 3.09,
the remaining US$1 million on the credit account is being kept as a provi-
sion toward settlement of contractors' claims.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
4.01        The Second Highway Project financed the continuation of technical
assistance started under the First Highway Project to train the Ministry of
Works' technical personnel in highway maintenance operations and the construc-
tion of feeder roads. Although the objective envisaged during appraisal to
turn over the operational responsibilities to Malian counterpart staff within
the project period was not achieved and the technical assistance had to be
further extended under the Third Highway Project, considerable progress was
made in the process of training unexperienced staff to become adequate and
fully responsible technicians.
4.02        Government's proposal to substitute the establishment of a per-
manent training center for fellowships abroad will certainly be advantageous
in the long run and greatly contribute to the further development of the
institutional capacity of the Ministry of Works. The use of Malian instructors
to train the Ministry's personnel further enhances the importance of this
training center. Government's efforts in this respect continue to be supported
under the Third Highway Project which finances technical assistance and
fellowships to help these Malian instructors improve their teaching methods.
4.03        Finally, the many administrative and technical problems which had
arisen during the construction of the Faladie-Segou Road and which had to be
solved by the Ministry's staff certainly have also served as stepping stones
to strengthen the minstry's institutional capacity.
V. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
General
5.01      The project as a whole forms part of the Government's policy to
upgrade and preserve existing transport facilities, and through the reduction
of transportation costs, to stimulate and support economic activities which
under Mali conditions, specifically means agriculture. In view thereof, the
more important aspects of the four highway projects financed by IDA since 1970
have been, and still are: improved road maintenance, betterment of feeder
roads, and strengthening and upgrading of one of the country's most heavily
travelled main roads, from Bamako via Faladie to Segou. In this respect it is
regrettable that the Bamako-Bougouni Road, which includes the important
Bamako-Faladi section and was expected to be financed by USAID, had to be
eliminated from the project (para. 3.04).



- 14 -
Technical Assistance and Studies
5.02      It was not feasible to calculate at the time of appraisal, and thus
now to re-evaluate, the economic return of those items of the project which
refer to continuation of technical assistance to the DPW. However, an im-
portant but not quantifiable benefit is that the continued technical assist-
ance and experience DPW staff obtained from involvement in supervision of this
difficult project in close cooperation with experienced Bank staff has further
contributed to the institution building which was begun under the First
Project. By the same token, the economic benefits of the engineering study
for the Bamako-Kolokani Road, the construction of which has been postponed to
a later date (para 3.13), cannot be calculated, nor can the results of the
trucking industry study.
Maintenance Equipment
5.03      With respect to the procurement of highway maintenance equipment,
the added items amounting to nearly US$1 million form only a relatively small
part of the equipment fleet now available to the DPW, including that financed
under the First Highway Project for an amount of US$4.23 million and that
financed by USAID for an amount of about US$3.25 million (including spare
parts and training) (para. 2.06). It is, therefore, not feasible to calculate
separately the economic return on the investment for equipment financed under
the Second Highway Project. At the time of appraisal the return was expected
to be at least 20% based on a rather conservative assumption on vehicle
operating costs. Since inflation affected vehicle operating costs much more
than the equipment procured in 1975 under 1974 contracts but not as much
maintenance was done as was expected due to shortage of operating funds, it may be
assumed that the rate of return remained about the same as at appraisal.
The Faladie-Segou Road
5.04      The economic return on the investment for the strengthening of
the Faladie-Segou Road was at the time of appraisal calculated at 29% on the
basis of comparing the cost of the project with the alternative of increasing
road maintenance expenditure sufficiently to avoid further serious deteriora-
tion of the existing road. In their Final Report dated September 1980, the
supervising consultants presented a rather detailed calculation of the
economic return of the Faladie-Segou Road, based on spot traffic counts
carried out on four sections of the road between January and December 1979.
The result is summarized in the following table:
ADT
length in
km          1979
Section 1 Faladie-Kobadalakoro         22             600
2 Kobadalakoro-Yana            95            500
3 Yana-Kandamini               86            450
4 Kandamini-Segou              20            475
223            490 average



- 15 -
At appraisal the average growth per annum of the vehicle fleet since 1976 was
conservatively assumed to be about 6%, although growth of the vehicle fleet
cannot be accurately established since statistics show only new vehicles
registered and not those withdrawn. It is evident, however, that the growth
of the fleet of trucks (15%) and tractor trailers (about 20% per annum) over
the 1965-1975 period is much greater than was assumed and thus also the
savings in operating cost of this share of the fleet. At appraisal, some
570 vpd were expected in 1979, on average on the full section.
5.05       The following table shows the assumed vehicle operating cost for
1980 (excluding taxes) in MF/km:
Without project    With project
light vehicles                       99                61
pick-up trucks                      155               103
trucks                              323               222
tractor-trailers                    351               237
The above figures are based on a 1977 study for the Sahel by the same con-
sultants. They compare with the 1972 figures for paved roads upon which the
appraisal evaluation was based: light vehicles (< 5 ton) MF 35 per km and
heavy vehicles (> 5 ton) MF 80 per km (Table 14, Appraisal Report).
5.06       The actual cost of the works (without taxes) amounted to MF 6.5
billion 1/ or MF 9.0 billion in 1980. based on 10% interest Der annum during
construction. Based on a 1977 study for road maintenance cost in the Sahel,
annual maintenance cost after 1980 is estimated at MF 1.254 million (US$2,800
equivalent) per km at 1980 prices. Total actual supervision cost amounted to
MF 893 million including interest until 1980. The summary based on the above
data shows an internal rate of return of 15%, or a benefit/cost ratio of 1.63
based on 10% interest. This rate would be about half of the appraisal estimate
but still adequate.
5.07      When comparing the above rate of return of 15% with the appraisal
estimate it must be further taken into account that:
(a)  the cost of the works is more than double the appraisal estimates as
a result of: (i) inflation which started immediately after the
original estimates were prepared; (ii) delays in execution; and
(iii) the road has been improved and strengthened over its full
length, rather than over only 60% of its length as originally
intended;
(b)  without having a solid basis for challenging them, it would appear
that assumed vehicle operating costs at 1980 prices without the
project, as shown in para. 5.05 are on the low side, namely about
MF 99 (US$0.22) per km for light vehicles, MF 323 (US$0.72) per km
for regular trucks and MF 351 (US$0.78) per km for tractor-trailers,
all on bad roads, resulting in savings of about one-third of these
rather low costs after reconstruction of the road to higher standards;
and
1/ at average US$1 = 421 MF.



- 16 -
(c) in their calculations the consultants ignored what would have
been the maintenance cost without the project.
5.08      In view of these considerations, IDA may be satisfied that this
component of the project has been successful, notwithstanding large cost
overruns and delays in its implementation.
VI. THE ROLE OF THE ASSOCIATION
6.01      The country's priorities in the road subsector were well reflected
in project composition and subsequent developments confirmed that the roads
selected for reconstruction were the most important in Mali. Notwithstanding
the fact that the overall increase in vpd on the Faladie-Segou Road was
somewhat less than estimated at appraisal (which may well result from the
introduction of heavier truck and tractor trailers during the construction
years) and that construction costs increased sharply, the ex-post economic
rate of return for this road remains satisfactory (para. 5.06).
6.02      The role of the Association was instrumental in breaking the dead-
lock between the Government consultants and the contractor (para. 3.17). Several
supervision missions which visited Mali more frequently than normal (up to
four times a year), were dedicated to assisting the parties in finding accept-
able solutions to serious conflicts. During the early years, this important
task became the focal point of the supervision missions and absorbed most of
their time, to the detriment of follow-up work on other project elements
such as the engineering study, the trucking industry study, and the Govern-
ment's compliance with covenants in the Credit Agreement.
VII.   CONCLUSIONS
7.01      Although the project was physically completed only recently (May
1981), by and large its contribution to Mali's economy may be considered
positive. That construction of the Faladie-Segou Road was brought to a satis-
factory conclusion, despite the many financial and technical problems which
confronted its implementation, can be considered a success in itself. Also,
further progress has been made in strengthening the Ministry of Works insti-
tutional capacity. The only question which might bear on the final evaluation
of the project are the contractor's claims which are not as yet settled.

MALI
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
CREDIT 599-MLI
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Landlocked Mali covers about 1.2 million km2, with 90% of its
1 million people living in rural areas. This low density population is served
by a 14,300 km road network, of which only about 3,300 km (including 1,670 km
of paved roads) provide all-weather service; a 640 km railway which leads to
the Senegal Railway and the Port of Dakar; the Senegal and Niger Rivers, which
however are only partially navigable; and two international airports at Bamako
and Gao and several small airfields. Thus, internal communications are poor
but in many cases their upgrading is difficult to justify as agriculture,
the main activity, depends on poor soils and irregular rainfall and provides
meager results. Despite a doubling of GDP per capita since 1975, it is still
only US$200 equivalent.
1.02      A country-wide transport survey financed in 1967-69 by UNDP concluded
that highway maintenance improvements and construction of low standard roads
had the highest priority. As a result the Directorate of Public Works prepared
a highway maintenance and feeder road program which formed the basis for the
IDA-financed First Highway Project (Credit 197-MLI, US$7.7 million, 1970).
The technical assistance and training components were reasonably successful,
but a serious shortfall occurred in the maintenance program: only 470 km of
the programmed 1,450 km for betterment were improved (PPAR 1913, 1978). Under
the Second Highway Project (Credit 383-MLI, US$17.8 million, 1973 and 1975),
IDA continued technical assistance and training, and provided for reconstruc-
tion of the paved Faladie-Segou Road (223 km), which was completed satisfac-
torily in 1981, following the solution of technical and financial problems
(PCR, July 1981). The Third Highway Project, subject of this report, and the
Fourth Highway Project (Credit 1104-MLI, US$17.0 million, 1981) also continued
assistance to road maintenance and improvement of feeder roads. Since Inde-
pendence, in the transport sector the Bank Group has also financed three
railway projects, totaling US$26.3 million.
1.03      In general, the main problem throughout implementation of these Bank
Group projects has been the shortage of Government resources, especially for
road maintenance, which has therefore always been below target.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      The Third Highway Project was prepared during implementation of the
Second, with the help of the French consultants who assisted the Directorate
of 2ublic ,Works under the First Highway Project and made a feeder road feasi-
bility study. The project was appraised in January/February 1975. Avail-
ability of local funds was considered the major issue.



- 22 -
2.02      During negotiations, held from October 28 to 30, 1975, it was agreed
to establish a revolving fund in a local bank to avoid the possibility of
delays due to the lack of liquidity of the Road Fund. The project was approved
by the Board, December 11, 1975; the Credit Agreement was signed January 9,
1976 and became effective March 10, 1976.
Project Description
2.03      The project aimed at improving feeder roads and road maintenance,
as well as providing a sound basis for future transport investment decisions.
It consisted of:
(a)  a 3.5-year betterment program for 1,200 km of feeder roads in
the groundnut and cotton-growing areas, including provision of
2 ferries;
(b)  a 3-year program to eliminate the periodic maintenance backlog
on 944 km of paved roads, including provision of spare parts,
equipping of two subdivision workshops, and technical assistance;
(c)   assistance to the Training Center established under the Second
Highway Project, through provision of equipment and technical
assistance; and
(d)  preparation of a country-wide Transport Plan.
2.04      The road sections to be improved or maintained, as well as road
standards, were detailed in the Credit Agreement. Since equipment and man-
power of two force account brigades were already in place since early 1975
and had improved 200 km of roads during that year, the Association agreed to
finance them retroactively. A total of 135 man-months of technical assistance
was foreseen.
Project Cost
2.05      Total project cost was estimated at US$13.4 million equivalent
(Table 1), of which US$8.4 million in foreign costs. UIS$2.8 million in local
and US$2.2 million in taxes and duties. The cost covered operating expenses
of force account brigades, including wages, equipment rental, supplies,
materials and overheads; spare parts; equipment for workshops and the Training
Center; and consultant services. The estimate included a 10% contingency for
quantity variations, except for maintenance where 15% was considered more
appropriate; it included price contingencies over the expected 3-year imple-
mentation period: for civil works, 15% in 1975, 14% in 1976 and 12% there-
after; for equipment and consultant services, 15% in 1975, 10% in 1976 and 8%
thereafter. An exchange rate of MF 450 per dollar was used.
Execution and Procurement
2.06      The National Directorate of Public Works (NDPW) was to execute the
project, except for the Transport Plan wnich would be the National Transoort



- 23 -
Office's responsibility, with the assistance of consultants. Given the
nature of procurement, for frequent and relatively small quantities as works
proceeded, Bank Group international competitive bidding procedures were waived
in favor of local competitive bidding or Government standard procurement
practices, which were acceptable to the Association.
Disbursements
2.07      The Credit of US$10 million was to finance 75% of the total project
cost including taxes, covering all foreign and 57% of local costs. Retro-
active financing by the Association up to US$1.1 million was provided for
road works and 10 man-months of technical assistance costs, incurred in 1975.
It was also envisaged that promptly after the Agreement's effectiveness,
US$500,000 equivalent would be deposited in a Special Account in a local Mali
bank for expenditures under the project; the Account was to be replenished
upon presentation of proper documentation. The expected disbursement schedule
is shown as Table 2; the closing date was June 30, 1979.
Important Covenants
2.08      The Credit Agreement included the following agreements reached at
negotiations:
-    The Government was to exchange views with the Association on interim
results of the Transport Plan Study, and based on the studies,
was to prepare a medium-term physical and financial road maintenance
plan, including equipment renewal, and establish priorities for new
road investments (Section 3.05 of the Credit Agreement);
-    The NDPW was to establish a cost-accounting system (Section 3.05(c)
of the Credit Agreement); and
The Government was to ensure appropriate allocations to the NDPW
and the Road Fund, ensure their proper management and utilization,
and meet all road maintenance requirements before allowing funds for
new road construction works (Section 4.03 of the Credit Agreement).
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      The Credit Agreement was signed January 9, 1976 and made effective
March 10, 1976. By the latter date project execution had already started on
the feeder road program. The start-up period and project implementation were
characterized by Government slowness, mainly in procurement procedures,
breakdown of equipment, shortages of local liquid funds for road main.enence
and a number of other problems, which by their accumulation delayed project
completion and reduced project output.



- 24 -
Feeder Road Program
3.02      Execution of the feeder road program started before credit effec-
tiveness; 200 km were improved in 1975 and bids for the 2 ferries were called
in November 1975.
3.03      The betterment brigades were constituted with equipment procured
in 1971 under the First Highway Project, which by 1976 was rather old and
subject to frequent breakdowns, and the performance of the Public Works
Equipment Service (PWES) was unsatisfactory. The revolving fund was useful
for the procurement of spares and materials, but delays in repairs continued.
Partly for this reason, the target of 300 km of road improvement per year was
not achieved; 200 km were improved in 1976. However, the target was recog-
nized as overly optimistic, and in June 1977 the decision was made to: (a)
reduce the program from 1,200 km to 1,000 km; (b) extend its implementation
period by one year, until end-1979; and (c) shift the funds provided for the
200 km no longer to be improved, to a detailed engineering study. The Govern-
ment undertook the renewal of key equipment under either its own budget or the
USAID loan signed in October 1976.
3.04      In all, 856 km were actually improved under the project (Table 4),
and completed in 1980 rather than the original target of 1,200 km by December
1978; in the final year only some 60 km were improved, explained by increasing
equipment breakdowns, delays in spare parts delivery, fuel shortages, and the
fact that 2 months were needed to relocate the brigades.
3.05      Bids for 2 ferries had been called in 1975, but when it was dis-
covered that 40-ton draught ferries envisaged would exceed the depth of the
streams to be crossed, new bids were invited and opened in June 1976. The
lowest bid included a price escalation clause which the Government negotiated
to a fixed price contract, still below the second lowest bid; discussions were
protracted and the contract was only signed in January 1978. The ferries were
delivered within the contractual time and put into operation in June 1979.
Paved Roads Maintenance
3.06      A backlog of maintenance of 944 km paved roads had developed, and
it was expected that over a 3-year program 187 km would be patched, 580 km
resealed and patched, 150 km surfaced and patched, and 28 km receive base
improvements and a double surface treatment. Two units were to be established:
a resealing and patching unit for spot repairing of pavement first, and a
resurfacing unit for periodic single and double surface treatments later.
3.07      The first unit started under the project in April 1976, but the
equipment fleet was unsatisfactory to start the second unit as scheduled:
part of the equipment had been procured in 1972 under the Second Highway
Project and was subject to frequent breakdowns and some items were missing
altogether. In view of thtis, the Association agreed to the Government s
request for reallocation of USS600,000 from operating expenses to procurement
of equipment, not foreseen at appraisal. The equipment was delivered by



- 25 -
mid-1978 but as it required the use of emulsion bitumen which was a new
technique for the Malian staff (it included a bitumen emulsion mixing plant
which required specialized staff to operate), the resurfacing unit was put
into operation in November 1979 only when the technical assistants to the
bituminous brigade arrived. These experts, previously scheduled to arrive in
October 1973, were delayed because of the Government's slowness in finalizing
the relevant contract; the Government had hoped to obtain this aid under a
bilateral grant which failed to materialize.
3.08      On the remaining 700 km, only routine maintenance was carried out,
mainly by NDPW subdivisions with Road Fund financing and partially by the
patching unit with project financing. Inasmuch as most of the works were
carried out later than the original schedule of December 1978, most roads had
deteriorated further. The bituminous brigade was plagued with successive
problems but it should be said that when the brigade was operational the
output for each elementary task was in quantity and quality in line with what
was foreseen at appraisal. The deterioration of the network produced the need
for heavier repairs per kilometer and prompted NDPW's decision to restrict the
bituminous brigade work to the essential Bougouni-Ivory Coast border section.
3.09      In addition to the delays in equipment and technical assistance
procurement and deterioration of the network, the following factors contri-
buted significantly to this shortfall:
-    a number of breakdowns of essential equipment including the break-
down of the power plant that powered the bituminous emulsion
plant;
-    poor management, lack of trained staff in the PiNES and insufficient
spare parts financing--reasons for the inefficiency of PWES identi-
fied in 1978; PWES performance began to improve only in the beginning
of 1980 after a new director was appointed and technical assistance
started to arrive; however, shortages of spare parts plagued the
project until its completion;
-    lack of continuous technical assistance to the bituminous brigade
(18 man-months from October 1979 to June 1980 and 12 man-months from
February to July 1981 financed under the project, and starting
at the end of 1981 one expert financed by FAC (France);
-    failure of 2 small local contractors to supply 25,000 m3 of river
gravel needed by the brigade by December 1980, and when by this date
only 44% was delivered, failure of the Government to take adequate
remedial action--other than setting up an insufficient force account
unit for river gravel production; and
-    cumbersome procurement procedures which require many successive
clearances by different agencies and 9 to 12 signatures before a
contract is effective.

Assistance to the Training Center
3.10      Construction of the Center was underway under the Second Highway
Project but its completion was delayed from late 1975 to July 1976, to January
1977. The same French consulting firm which assisted NDPW under previous
projects for the force account road works and PWES in consortium under this
project was selected to assist further in the setting up of the Training
Center, and its contract was signed in October 1976. When the Government's
expectations to obtain bilateral aid for training of Malian instructors did
not materialize, the technical assistance contract was extended for 20 man-
months to that effect. Furthermore, a contract was signed with a British firm
to secure training in Europe of five instructors. Delivery of furniture,
vehicles and teaching materials for the Center was completed in the first
quarter of 1978, despite the fact that first bids had been already called in
November 1975.
3.11      Whereas it was expected that 200 Malian technical and skilled staff
would be substantially trained, only some 150 will actually have received
training over short periods.
National Transport Plan
3.12      A contract for the preparation of the National Transport Plan was
signed with a French/German joint venture of consulting firms in April 1978,
and at the Government's firm request, included the participation of a number
of civil seryants as experts or counterparts. A draft final report was
completed in May 1979, but presented to the Association only in November 1979.
The voluminous report (about 2,300 pages with no summary) had a cumbersome
presentation, which may be due to the fact that the study was carried out by
three separate teams (French, German and Malian), and that the consultant
spent an excessive amount of time in the beginning organizing work and col-
lecting data, and not enough time at the end in preparing and proposing a
coherent, realistic transport study. By the time the Association was ready to
pass on its comments, the report had already been finalized on the basis of
the Government's comments only. In meetings during February 1980, attended by
the Government, IDA and the consultants on the report, the consultants were
asked to prepare a summary report, which was completed in September 1981.
3.13      The report was very descriptive, lacked unity, and had little
straightforward economic analysis or consistent conclusions and recommenda-
tions. Largely reflecting the Government's objectives and priorities, it
proposed massive investments, particularly for highways and was unrealistic
both in terms of the individual project's economic justification and of
resources, forecasts and allocations. However, it made more sense if the
time-frame and the scarcity of financing were not taken into consideration
and each of the individual reports was accurate.
Bamako-Bougouni Road Detailed Engineering
3.14      The revision of the detailed engineering of the Bamako-Bougouni
Road, carried out under the First Highway Project, was included under the



- 27 -
project when the size of the feeder road program was reduced (para. 3.03), in
the expectation that works could be included under the Fourth Highway Project
(in 1974 the works were dropped from the Second Highway Project). The same
French consulting firm was selected; studies were started in 1977 and completed
in mid-1978, satisfactorily.
Project Actual Cost
3.15      The final project cost is about the same in dollars as at appraisal,
as the works were curtailed to stay within available finances; however, the
average exchange rate resulted in MF 462 per dollar, or 3% more than at
appraisal, enabling also a 3% higher cost in francs. If all the works had
been carried out at pari passu estimates, the project would have cost some
US$18 million, with a 40% overrun. The technical assistance cost more than
doubled as execution was protracted and took 6 years instead of 3; the operat-
ing cost per km of works resulted as the predicted estimate for feeder roads,
but twice the estimate for paved road maintenance, and more than US$2 million
worth of unforeseen equipment and spares had to be procured (Table 1).
Disbursements
3.16      Table 2 shows actual disbursements; they lagged behind, increasing
to 57% of the estimate by the original closing date, which had to be postponed
3 times, to December 31, 1981. However, they followed the Western Africa
disbursement profile. Disbursements per category are shown in Table 3.
Amendments
3.17      The Credit Agreement was first amended 6 months after its effec-
tiveness, June 15, 1976, essentially to reallocate US$600,000 from operating
expenses to equipment purchases for paved road maintenance.
3.18      The Agreement was amended aaain April 8, 1978, to reduce the
feeder road allocation and program size, to include a new category for the
Bamako-Bougouni study; and to add to the disbursement rate of 75% of cost
including taxes, 89% of cost net of taxes, which were equivalent, for con-
sultant services. Following appraisal of the Fourth Highway Project, the
Credit Agreement for the Third was amended again February 26, 1979, to provide
for: (a) 9 man-months of technical assistance for the Training Center, and
fellowships abroad; (b) 50 man-months of technical assistance and spare parts
to PWES; and (c) an increased allocation for paved road maintenance. Finally,
on June 30, 1980, the percentage of disbursement for spare parts was reduced
from 75% to 43%.
Consultant Performance
3.19      The performance of consultants was in general satisfactory; the
consultants who prepared the Transport Plan should have presented a better
coordinated and more concise, realistic report, but then, the reDorting
requirements had not been specified in their contract.

IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Compliance with Covenants
4.01      The Government complied only partially with the Agreement covenants.
The main shortcoming was in the allocation of proper funds for road main-
tenance (Section 4.03) similar to the experience encountered under the First
and Second Highway Projects, and which was identified as the major issue at
appraisal of the project. Execution of the project suffered continuously
from shortages of local funds, which prevented adequate supply purchases.
Furthermore, Road Fund liquidity was minimal given its "replenishment" with
illiquid postal checks, as mentioned in the Second Highway Project PCR: the
Road Fund was to receive revenues from fuel taxes, but oil companies which
collected the taxes were paid for fuel supplies to the Government with postal
checks for a larger amount than was due the Government for taxes collected,
and thus the oil companies replenished the Road Fund with postal checks. The
Mali Development Bank and suppliers came to refuse the illiquid postal checks.
A meeting between the Association and the Government was held in Bamako in
February 1980 to discuss this problem in general, as it was due to overall
country financial constraints and not only to the unwillingness of the Govern-
ment to comply with funding requirements; the decision was made to hold
negotiations of the Fourth Highway Project only after an acceptable proposal
to clear up the Road Fund liquidity problem was made. Then, as no solution
could be found, the Fourth Highway Project was transformed into an interim
Road Maintenance Project; improvements on the Road Fund liquidity problem
were expected to follow an agreement with IMF.
4.02      Furthermore, road maintenance was not given priority over new
investments in resource allocation; a large part of the revenues earmarked
for roads was used as the Malian contribution to mainly foreign-financed road
investments; investment expenditures were on average 4 times the actual
maintenance expenditures on roads.
4.03      The exchange of views between the Government and the Association
on the Transport Plan Study (para. 3.05(a)) was not satisfactory and in
particular was missing when the draft was completed and had the consequence of
substantially reducing the quality, usefulness and timeliness of the Study.
The consultant's draft report was issued just after a supervision mission left
(March 19, 1979); the transport commission set up by the Government to follow-
up the Study issued its comments and discussed them with the consultant in
October 1979. Upon learning in September only that a draft report had been
issued, the Bank requested and subsequently received a copy in October. One
Bank mission was in Bamako December 1979 to discuss major issues on the
proposed Fourth Highway Project but did not discuss and was not informed
about developments on the Transport Plan Study. In February 1980 the Bank
made known its comments which were discussed and agreed with Government but
the .zonsultant had already issued his final report based only on Government
comments recetved in October. From the documents in the Files it is not clear



- 29 -
whether the Government ordered the final report or the consultant issued it
independently, but in February 1980 everyone agreed on the necessity to amend
the contract to allow the consultant to prepare a summary report.
Government Pe-formance
4.04      Besides not complying with the covenants as discussed above, the
Government was slow in signing necessary contracts for technical assistance
and slow in appointing trainees; it did not have or provide equipment as was
required for the project brigades, a circumstance which was aggravated
by the poor repair capacity of the Equipment Service.
4.05      All three highway projects financed by IDA so far included a tech-
nical assistance component directed first to reorganizing and then strength-
ening the NDPW in the execution of its responsibilities in the road sector.
Compared with the situation existing before the implementation of the First
Highway Project, IDA's efforts to contribute to improving the performance of
the NDPW have been successful. In fairness to the NDPW, however, it must be
recognized also that some problems encountered in the past and still being
encountered upon completion of this Third Highway Project, are not the respon-
sibility of the NDPW as an institution. The most crucial problem in the
execution of Mali's highway responsibilities is the shortage of domesticaily
generated funds which has resulted in the limiting of routine maintenance to
emergency road work.
4.06      It must be recognized that efforts will need to be continued for
several years before NDPW's operations in the highway sector have reached
the point where institution building through technical assistance to both
operations and training through NDPW's Training Center can be discontinued.
This circumstance is reflected in the Fourth Highway Project currently being
implemented which again focusses on catching up with the backlog of periodic
bituminous maintenance and on still further improving maintenance operations.
For many African countries which have become independent only recently and
have still a low per capita income, the task of rehabilitating and maintaining
large road networks in huge scarcely populated territories is beyond their
capabilities.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      The economic evaluation at appraisal made separate analyses of
the project's two main components, the Leeder roads program and Dacklog
maintenance. A similar approach Is followed in this report, which also
utilizes the same general methodologies o. the appraisal, although with
changes in some assumptions.



- 30 -
Feeder Roads
5.02      At appraisal, the feeder roads program consisted of 1,200 km of
feeder roads to be built, 660 km in Mali's groundnut zone and 540 in the
cotton zone. The need for the roads stemmed from several agricultural devel-
opment schemes, where the goal was to double production along the project
roads over a 5-year program following their improvement, and to double again
in the next 5 years. Taking a more conservative view of such projections, the
appraisal report assumed a cumulative increase in production of 54% during the
first 5 years, and a cumulative 42% for the remaining 6 years; economic life
of the feeder roads was assumed to be 11 years. The economic evaluation was
based on truck operating cost savings while savings to passenger cars were
omitted, as the rate of return was a satisfactory 17%, excluding such savings.
5.03      In this re-evaluation, actual data and revised forecasts have been
used. Construction of feeder roads covered 856 km, or 71% of the appraisal's
estimate; of these, 432 km were in the groundnut zone, and 424 km in the
cotton zone (Table 4). In the groundnut-raising area, agricultural production
followed a substantially different course from that envisaged at appraisal.
As a result of a combination of poor weather and a slump in the groundnut
(and groundnut oil) world market, production dropped dramatically instead
of increasing; in the Kita/Kolokani area, the most directly covered by the
project's roads, production fell by 27% from 1975 to 1980 (60,000 tons to
44,000 tons) and it is projected that the declining trend will continue in
the coming years. In the cotton-raising area, production performance was much
better.  In 1980, production was 82% higher than in 1975; slower but steady
growth is foreseen for the coming years. In addition, cereal production
increased by 65% during 1975-1980 and an even higher growth rate is foreseen
for the future. On balance, freight traffic is expected to continue to
increase by an average 6.5% per year until the latter part of the decade.
5.04      Uniform farmgate prices are established by the Government and have
been continuously increased; 1/ it is the Government who is the main bene-
ficiary of transport cost reductions. Benefits per ton/km transported are
as estimated at appraisal, at MF 65; 2/ traffic through 1980 and projections
thereafter are based on the agricultural production of the cotton and ground-
nut-raising areas. Feeder roads maintenance costs from the Road Maintenance
1/                                  Producer Price (MF/kg)
1975  1976/77   1977/78  1978/79   1979/80  1982
Groundnuts          40     45        50                         90
Millet/Sorghum      32     32        36
Cotton              75     75       90        95      115      130
2/   If the average feeder road trip is some 40 km, the savings per ton
would be some MF 2,600, equivalent to    % of the groundnut and 3% of
the cotton producer prices in 1978.



- 31 -
Project SAR dated February 6, 1981 were used. An average life of 9 years
has been assumed for the project's roads. Excluding technical assistance and
ferry procurement costs, the re-estimated rate of return for the feeder roads
program would be 15%; including the technical assistance cost, the return
would be 10%, which compares to the 17% return expected at appraisal (Table 5).
The traffic trends in the two areas covered by the project suggests that roads
in the cotton-raising area had, on average, a better economic return than
expected, while roads in the groundnut-raising area are on average, only
marginal.
Paved Road Maintenance
5.02      In Mali, 944 km of the most traveled paved roads were to be con-
structed, resealed, surfaced, or patched. Traffic on these roads was projected
to grow at 4% per year over the life of the works, which was estimated to
range from 1 year for regular patching to 20 years for reconstruction. The
rate of return for this component was estimated at 120%. However, only about
250 km were covered, or 26% of the original program, and were all on the most
trafficked, Hougouni-Sikasso-Zegoua Road.
5.06      In reassessing the benefits of this component, the following main
elements were considered. Traffic projections and vehicle operating costs
were taken from the Fourth Highway Project (SAR of February 1981) which
estimated that average traffic growth over Mali's main roads was 8% through
1978 and forecast a 5% annual growth beyond this year; traffic counts taken on
the Bougouni-Zegoua Road are consistent with these figures. The composition
of traffic on this road includes a substantially larger proportion of heavy
vehicles than considered at appraisal, and is as follows: 30-ton trucks: 25%;
10-ton trucks: 41%; passenger vehicles: 34%. VOC were estimated on the basis
of the roads' roughness; assumptions regarding changes in roughness values,
with and without the project, are explained in Table 6.
5.07      On the cost side, all costs of civil works, spare parts and road
equipment are included in the re-evaluation. Annual maintenance costs are
based on estimates made in the SAR of the Fourth Highway Project.
5.08      The re-evaluated economic rate of return for the maintenance com-
ponent based on costs and benefits through 1988 and shown in Table 6 is 56%;
when technical assistance costs are also included the return drops to 45%;
which is satisfactory and in line with the high return normally obtained in
highway maintenance programs.
VI. THE ROLE OF THE ASSOCIATION
6.01      Due to the Association's heavy involvement in the First and Second
Highway Projects, the additional preparation by the Association has been
rather light for the Third Highway Project. Although the Credit Agreement for
the Third Highway Project was signed nearly 3 years later than for the Second
Highwav Project Agreement, both projects were substantially completed around



- 32 -
the same time, namely late 1980. Thus, all supervision missions for the
Third Highway Project were combined with those of the Second. But the major
component of the Second Highway Project was the reconstruction of the Faladie-
Segou Road, the execution of which met with many problems with the contractor
and eventually led to a supplementary credit (see PCR for that project dated
July 27, 1981). In addition, major macro-economic problems started to develop
at about the same time and grew rapidly, hindering the preparation of a
full-scale Fourth Highway Project. In view thereof, most of the efforts of
the supervision missions was devoted to assisting the Government in solving
these problems, and with hindsight, the time spent led to some extent to
neglecting problems which arose with the other, somewhat secondary components
of the Second Highway Project. These components were, however, much the same
or similar to those which are the major components of the Third Highway
Project.
6.02      This set of circumstances may be partly responsible for the Associa-
tion's possible lack of awareness and persistent follow-up when it became
obvious at an early stage that the performance of the Government left much to
be desired. There were delays in signing contracts for technical assistance,
and for equipment and spare parts for the PWES, the performance of which was
poor.  As a result, the performance and production of the feeder roads brigades
did not reach the expected level of productivity and that of the bituminous
maintenance brigades lagged far behind the expected level.    Improvements
became evident only about the time the funds of the Third Highway Project
became exhausted.
6.03      Also, no supervision was carried out from April to October 1979,
the key period for the study for a new Transpotation Plan. As a result the
Association did not receive a draft copy of the report in sufficient time to
have its comments on contents and format reflected in the final version
(para. 4.03).
6.04      Whereas the problems with the Road Fund started already with the
implementation of the Second Highway Project, meetings between representatives
of the Association and the Government especially devoted to this issue took
place as late as February 1980.
6.05      The above observations are not intended to blame the Association for
the unsatisfactory performance of the Government. However, apart from the
emphasis on the construction problems signalled in para. 6.01, it would appear
that particularly the 11-month intervals in supervision missions (between May
1977 and April 1978 and again between the latter date and March 1979) occurred
at a time when more frequent follow-up on the events related to the Third
Highway Project would have been desirable.
6.06      Furthermore, the Bamako-Bougouni Road which had been studied earlier
for inclusion in the Second Highway Project but was dropped, was studied again
for inclusion in the Fourth Highway Project. In the meantime no maintenance
was carried out and eventually again the reconstruction proDosal was dropped;
further study updating will be needed for this road, which bv now is verv
degraded although it has the most important traffic, some 530) vpd.



- 33 -
VII. CONCLUSION
7.01      No project in Mali can be isolated from the country's overwhelming
problems. Particularly, the Third Highway Project, a small highway project,
despite the good will of Government and Bank staff had to face an accumulation
of difficulties generated by about all possible sources: claims by a foreign
contractor and consultant developed under the Second Highway Project and
wasted a great deal of energy and staff time; contracts with local gravel
suppliers had to be terminated for unsatisfactory performance; consultants
issued a draft report essential for future transport planning in a form which
hindered discussion on the substance; the need for complementary equipment,
spare parts financing and for improvement in the equipment repair service were
not foreseen; the intervals between supervision missions were overly long at
times; the Association lacked an in depth view on macro-economic problems as
they affected project implementation, Government staff took few initiatives
and were overpowered by bureaucratic difficulties that delayed by several
months each contract signature and implementation; and finally the Government
made the postal checking system illiquid and gave expensive highway invest-
ments with only long-term returns priority over inexpensive, economical road
maintenance.
7.02      Given this context, the project can be considered successful because
71% of the feeder road program was completed; the road with the highest
priority and the most traffic had one section studied for financing under an
expected future project while the second section received periodic maintenance
works and the balance of the paved network, above minimum-level routine
maintenance; staff training was initiated; the PWES implemented a successful
reorganization; and the bases for transport planning were improved.
7.03      The conclusion is that in M4ali, because problems tend to aggregate
and thus it becomes necessary to deal with them simultaneously through longer
and more frequent supervision missions, or alternatively, reinforced technical
assistance, in most cases the proposed time frame of projects should be
considerably lengthened.
