REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI
FOR A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Mali for the equivalent of US$10.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Third Highway Project.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
Background
2.        A report on "Recent Economic Developments in Mali" (233a-MLI) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on September 27, 1973. Country data
are attached as Annex I. The next economic mission is planned for the begin-
ning of 1976.
3.        With a per capita GDP of less than US$100, Mali is one of the poorest
countries in Africa and one of the 25 "least developed" countries identified
by the United Nations. It has faced difficult economic problems during most
of its existence as an independent nation resulting mainly from its geographical
situation and very modest resource position. The Government's policy of hiring
all graduates of secondary and higher schools unable to find employment in the
private sector has exerted constant upward pressure on public expenditure.
The policy to keep essential consumer prices low is implemented through state
enterprises, many of which incur heavy financial losses as a result. These
losses are financed by bank credit, which explains much of the rapid credit
expansion in recent years. Price and credit policies have contributed to
Mali's continued balance of payments deficit. The cumulative effects of the
recent drought in the Sahel, the sharp rise in energy prices and strong world
inflation have dramatically aggravated Mali's economic problem.
Recent Economic Developments
4.        After growing at an average rate of 5 percent a year in 1970-1972,
the economy suffered a major setback in 1973-1974. GDP declined by 6 percent
in 1973 and stagnated in 1974 as the contribution of the primary sector de-
clined because of the drought. In 1973, cereal production was more than one-
third below the 1972 level; there was a slight upturn in 1974, however. Cot-
ton and groundnuts, the main cash and export crops, fell comparatively little
in 1973, but their decline accelerated in 1974. Livestock production remained
relatively high in 1973 because of large-scale emergency slaughtering to mini-
mize the effects of the drought, but fell to about 70 percent of its 1972
level in 1974, reflecting the heavy losses in the livestock population.



-2-
5.        Public savings have remained negative despite considerable improve-
ment in tax collection in recent years. Government current expenditures have
been rising at a rate of over 11 percent annually between 1970 and 1974, chiefly
because of the strong increase of wages and salaries whose share reached 67
percent in 1974. As a result, the overall deficit (excluding investment ex-
penditures financed out of foreign aid) rose from MF 2.2 billion in 1970 (9.2
percent of total spending) to MF 7.7 billion in 1974 (21.2 percent). Never-
theless, the deficits in the drought years 1973 and 1974 remained below what
had been expected earlier for two reasons: (i) Fonds Europeen de Developpement
(FED) made up for the loss of revenue from the cattle tax that had been sus-
pended to help drought-stricken farmers and herders, and (ii) Government ef-
forts to speed up tax collection and improve tax administration led to the
collection of over MF 4 billion in back taxes during 1973 and 1974. Further,
the introduction of a "taxe conjoncturelle" in mid-1974 was expected to yield
another MF 500 million in revenue. Thus, instead of stagnating, revenue in
1973 and 1974 increased faster on average than in the two years before.
6.        The balance of payments, which had improved through 1972 despite a
continued overall deficit, also deteriorated substantially during the past
two years. Although the value of exports of goods and non-factor services
continued to grow at healthy rates, this was far from sufficient to prevent
the resource gap from expanding. Rising prices for Mali's main export com-
modities (cotton, livestock, groundnuts) more than offset the reduction in
volume caused by the drought and some secondary items increased in importance,
but with the value of food imports nearly quadrupling and that of oil imports
more than doubling between 1972 and 1974 total imports of goods and non-factor
services rose almost 100 percent, reaching US$206 million (MF 99.2 billion)
in 1974, and the resource gap surged from US$39 million (MF 19.9 billion) in
1972 to a record of US$112 million (MF 53.8 billion) in 1974 -- equivalent
to 26 percent of GDP against 11 percent in 1972.
7.        As in the past, Malian workers' remittances and other private trans-
fers helped reduce this deficit. Much more importantly, grant aid to the
Government increased from US$21 million (MF 10.6 billion) in 1972 and over
US$49 million (MF 21.7 billion) in 1973 to US$70 million (MF 33.9 billion) in
1974. Official borrowing -- including use of the IMF Oil Facility (SDR 4.0
million in 1974) -- also increased considerably. Nevertheless, the overall
balance of payments deficit soared from US$3 million (MF 1.5 billion) in 1972
to US$26 million (MF 12.3 billion) in 1974. At the end of 1974, net foreign
exchange reserves of the banking system stood at minus US$115 million (MF 55.4
billion). This was made possible by the right to draw on the Operations
Account with the French Treasury, an arrangement Mali has relied upon since
it rejoined the Franc Zone in 1967.
Foreign Aid
8.        Public investment is mainly financed by foreign aid.    During much of
the sixties the USSR and the People's Republic of China were the most important
aid donors. At the end of 1973, they held about one-third each of Mali's ex-
ternal public debt disbursed and outstanding. Aid disbursements (net) from



-3-
Development Assistance Committee (DAC) sources increased from US$23 million
in 1969 to US$70 million in 1973, averaging US$37 million annually during the
five-year period. Roughly half of this amount came from bilateral (France,
United States, Germany, Canada), the other half from multilateral sources
(EEC Fund, United Nations, IDA). Nearly 95 percent of the inflow during 1969-
1973 consisted of grants.
9.        Mali's external public debt outstanding at the end of 1973 was US$368
million, including an undisbursed amount of US$85 million. IDA's share in the
total amount disbursed and outstanding was 7.7 percent. Repayments of prin-
cipal and interest due in 1973 would have claimed about 19 percent of foreign
exchange earnings (15 percent in 1972), but actual debt service payments were
small (1.5 percent in 1972, 1.7 percent in 1973) owing to the rescheduling
since 1970 of Chinese, Russian and some other debts under short- to medium-term
arrangements. Mali received five stand-by credits from the IMF, of which
SDR 5.5 million are outstanding. In March 1974 the IMF agreed to reschedule
SDR 2.5 million of payments due in 1974 and 1975. A further postponement of
payments commitments totaling SDR 2 million was approved in January 1975.
Development Prospects
10.       With rainfall in the 1974/75 season near the 30-year average, Mali's
short-term prospects have improved; harvests are expected to be better than
in the preceding two years and economic growth should pick up in 1975. Despite
this more favorable outlook the Government requested another 150,000 tons of
food aid to make up for local shortages and to rebuild grain reserves. The
Bamako area paradoxically suffered considerable flood damage in the Fall of
1974. Prospects for the 1975 balance of payments still appear relatively
favorable. Tentative estimates show a sizeable reduction of the resource gap
to US$92 million as exports continue to grow while food imports are almost
halved compared with 1974; oil import costs increase by a relatively modest
20 percent. Private transfers should stay at their 1974 level, and grant aid
to the Government is expected to fall little from last year's peak, totaling
close to US$60 million. Private and official borrowing, taken together, is
estimated to be the same as in 1974. As a result, the overall balance of
payments deficit in 1975 would be reduced to US$20 million.
11.       Over the longer run, Mali's growth prospects will largely depend on
the success of the new Five-Year Plan. The Plan covers the period 1974-1978,
but it had a slow start.   As in the past, the economy will also be greatly
influenced by factors beyond the Government's control, such as the weather
and changes in the terms of trade. The Plan's GDP growth target is 7.3 percent
a year. Total planned expenditures (at 1974 prices) are put at MF 395 billion
(US$878 million), of which external sources are expected to finance 85 percent.
As during the 1970-1972 Economic and Financial Recovery Program, the rural
sector, agro-industry and supporting transport infrastructure receive highest
priority, and still greater weight than in the past is given to water resources
and hydro-power development. Two large multi-purpose schemes -- for power
generation, irrigation and possibly navigation -- are planned. One would
involve the construction of a dam at Selingue on the Sankarani River, a



-4-
tributary of the Niger, upstream from Bamako close to the border with Guinea,
the other would consist of the construction of a dam at Manantali on one of
the tributaries of the Senegal River in the west of Mali as part of a huge
program to develop the Senegal River basin for the benefit of Mali, Senegal
and 'Iauritania under the aegis of OMVS 1/. But complex economic, financial
and technical issues raised by these projects and coordination between them
are still unresolved.
12.       Compared with the actual expenditures under the 1970-1972 Recovery
Program, expenditures envisaged by the Five-Year Plan are almost three times
as high overall and over four times as high in the rural sector. The Govern-
ment hopes that new partners will join the traditional sources of aid to help
achieve these very ambitious targets. In view of Mali's low income level, the
Government's limited capacity to quickly generate budgetary savings and the
size of existing external debt, external aid must be on the most concessionary
terms possible and should cover a high proportion of total project costs,
including substantial amounts of local expenditures.
PART II:  BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALI
13.       The proposed credit would be IDA's eleventh operation in Mali,
bringing the total of IDA funds committed to US$93.2 million, most of them
during the past three years. Of the presently outstanding amount (US$83.2
million), US$36.1 million had been disbursed as at September 30, 1975. Annex
II contains a summary statement of these Credits as at September 30, 1975, as
well as notes on the execution of current projects.
14.       Experience with ongoing projects has generally been good, although
the extreme shortage of rainfall and reduced flooding of the Niger River have
seriously hindered production under the Mopti rice project. An exception,
however, should be made for the telecommunications project which has finan-
cial difficulties mainly due to the combined effect of an optimistic original
cost estimate, a two-year delay, unforeseen inflation, a lack of international
competition and currency realignments. Steps have been taken to seek addi-
tional sources of financing and the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique
appears to be willing to provide some additional financing for this project.
15.       Mali has considerable potential for agricultural and livestock
development on which the bulk of the population depends for a livelihood.
In fact, most of the operations envisaged by the Bank Group in the near future
are related in some measure to the rural sector. They include a cotton and
cereal project and a second rice project, the former providing cotton process-
ing and storage facilities and general support for food crop production in

organization in charge of the coordination of development efforts in the
Senegal river valley.



-5-
the south, the latter providing a follow-up to the Mopti rice project. These
two projects are likely to absorb all the remaining funds available for lend-
ing to Mali under the Fourth Replenishment. In addition, there are a number
of projects in agriculture, transport and other sectors for which the Govern-
ment will be seeking Bank Group financing, and if all these projects are to
go forward, a major effort to secure financing from other sources will be
needed to supplement IDA funds.
PART III:   THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN MALI
The Transport System
16.       Mali's transport system is fairly extensive and consists of the
following infrastructure: 13,200 km of roads of which 3,300 km all-weather;
a 640 km railway which links Bamako with Koulikoro and Kayes and then via the
Senegalese Railway with the port of Dakar; 1,650 km of inland waterways,
navigable only about seven months per year; an international airport at Bamako;
and about a dozen local airfields. The two main international routes are:
(a) the railway from Bamako to the Port of Dakar -- 1,283 km,
640 km of which are in Mali -- which carries excluding
drought relief traffic (300,000 tons of grain), about
350,000 tons of international traffic; and
(b) a road/rail combination from Bamako to the Port of Abidjan,
approximately 1,230 km in length (a paved road leads from
Bamako to Ouangolodougou, Ivory Coast, which is on the
railway to Abidjan) carrying about 60,000 tons of total
international traffic.
17.       The Government controls the major transport companies: R4gie des
Chemins de Fer du Mali (RCFM) or Mali Railways; Compagnie Malienne de Transport
Routier (CMTR), a trucking company carrying about 20 percent of total road
freight; Compagnie Malienne de Navigation (Comanav), a navigation company
handling about 70 percent of waterway traffic; and Air Mali, the only domestic
air carrier which also handles a considerable amount of international traffic
to and from Mali.
18.       The Government's transport strategy has focused on developing
local transport infrastructure in support of overall economic growth, on
promoting regional integration, and on building an appropriate international
network to link Mali with the coast. The Bank Group's efforts in the transport
sector, started in 1966 with a credit (Credit 95-MLI) which helped to rehabili-
tate and modernize the railway. In 1969, UNDP financed and the Bank supervised
a countrywide transport survey by consultants which has formed the basis of
subsequent Bank operations in the sector. These have included: a first highway



-6-
project (Credit 197-MLI) for improvement of highway maintenance, upgrading of
agricultural feeder roads, and preparation of pre-investment studies to re-
habilitate Mali's two main trunk roads from Bamako to Bougouni and to Segou;
a second highway project (Credit 383-MiLI) for rehabilitation of the above two
trunk roads and for preparation of pre-investment studies for the Bamako-Kolokani
road; and a second railway project (Credit 384-IILI) for additional equipment
and track renewal. The Government now wishes to update this survey and has
asked the Association to finance under the proposed third highway project
preparation of a new transport plan (para. 29).
Road Transport Industry
19.       The Government, through the 'Ministry of Transport and Public Works
(MTPW), administers the road industry, controlling tariffs and the distribu-
tion of both international as well as important local freight. Trucking or-
ganizations are many and range from a big cooperative consisting of some 550
vehicle owners to individual owners. In 1974, the vehicle fleet was estimated
at about 19,000, of which 63 percent were passenger cars, 21 percent vans and
pick-ups and 16 percent trucks and busses.
20.       The trucking industry is faced with such problems as poor management
and organization and a seasonal work cycle based on the agricultural calendar,
all of which have resulted in a low average load factor. Part of the efficiency
problem also seems to stem from the low truckers' rates which the Government
kept fixed from 1967 until October 1974, when it awarded carriers a 43 percent
interim rate increase. Among other objectives, the trucking industry study
provided for under the Second Highway Project and scheduled for completion
during 1976, will determine how far these fixed low rates have contributed to
a situation in which truckers lack incentives for new investments, and to what
extent inadequate management, organization, and maintenance are responsible
for the difficult trucking situation. During negotiations of tte Second
Highway Project, the Government agreed to implement as appropriate, and
according to a timetable satisfactory to the Association, the study's recommen-
dations.
Highway Administration
21.       The MTPW has overall transport sector responsibilities, and through
the Directorate of Public Works (DPW), is responsible for highway planning,
design and construction and for maintenance of all roads except local dirt
roads and tracks.   The Ministry of Plan shares with the above Ministry the
responsibility for investment planning.
22.       DPW has been extensively reorganized over the past five years, and
the responsibility for highway administration is now shared among several
divisions, each under the direct control of the Director General of Public
Wlorks. The DPW staff includes about 20 Malian engineering graduates, 60 trained
technicians, and 1,500 workers with varying degrees of skill and training.
Technical assistance for strengthening the organization of DPW and training of



-7-
its staff was provided under both the First and Second Highway Projects. The
results have been most encouraging, but further training of laborers, techni-
cians and supervisors is still needed. The Government, with the assistance of
the Association, is setting up a Public Works Training Center for supervisors,
foremen, timekeepers and workers which will complement the existing mechanics
school. The building for the center has been financed under the Second Highway
Project with money for overseas training that was reassigned. Equipment and
technical assistance will be provided under the proposed third project (para. 29).
Road Construction Industry
23.       The Central Technical Service of DPW designs minor roads, while
major highways are usually designed by consultants. The DPW's own surveying
institute and well-equipped National Public Works Laboratory are usually
retained as sub-contractors to participate in highway engineering studies.
The national laboratory is equipped to perform almost all soil and material
tests required for design and supervision. Over the past few years, construc-
tion of major highways has been executed primarily by foreign contractors, and
to a lesser extent by DPW's own forces and the Malian Army (Bamako-Koulikoro).
DPW's forces were equipped under the first and second projects.
Maintenance
24.       DPW's Roads and Bridges Division maintains all roads except local
roads and tracks, and the Highway Equipment Pool maintains the vehicle and
equipment fleet. The previous two highway projects considerably strengthened
the basic organization of both these services. However, due to a lack of
funds caused by factors beyond the Government's control such as expensive
and insufficient fuel supply, inflation, the continuous drought between 1969
and 1973 and the heavy traffic resulting from the Sahelian relief operations
which further damaged the roads, several roads are in poor condition requir-
ing a considerable amount of repair. The Government is unable to carry out
this repair without assistance, particularly on the paved roads. This
assistance will be provided under the proposed project.
Financing
25.       The Government finances highway expenditures with funds derived
mainly from fuel taxes, which are deposited directly in the Road Fund 1/,
while other taxes (import duties on vehicles, equipment and spare parts, and
vehicle registration charges) go into the general budget. In the 1971-1974
period, highway expenditures averaged about MF 4 billion (US$9 million) per
year of which investment accounts for MF 3 billion and maintenance, including
administration, MF 1 billion. According to DPW, estimated road investment
expenditures for the Government's new five-year plan period 1974/78 amount
1/   The Road Fund is used to finance road maintenance and construction
activities as well as DPW's overhead; the Road Fund is administered
by the Director General of Public Works.



-8-
to about MF 12 billion (US$30 million) per annum. These figures, however,
are Planning Office and DPW estimates at underestimated 1974 prices. To
reflect real 1974 prices, they have to be increased by as much as 25 to 100
percent depending on the project.
26.       The Government will therefore have to find additional highway
revenues by increasing fuel taxes or earmarking more or all road user taxes
for highway purposes. This suggests furthermore that the Government will also
have to scale down its investment program for the current five-year period.
The proposed new transport plan will re-evaluate and update the present
five-year plan in the light of the traffic needs, the new cost structure and
the country's financial position.
27.       In order to find a solution to the basic issues raised by these
financial constraints, the Association is proposing to continue discussions
with the Government on the determination of the level of current and capital
resources which can reasonably be set aside for transportation in the light
of transport maintenance and investment needs and other priorities which will
be determined by the proposed transport plan study. During negotiations
Government accepted to give priority to maintenance over investment expendi-
tures in the allocation of resources from the Road Fund and to keep a separate
accounting system for these expenditures (see Sections 4.03 (d) and 3.05 (c))
of draft Credit Agreement).
PART IV: THE PROJECT
28.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Third Highway Project - Mali"
(No. 888 MLI) dated November    , 1975 is being circulated separately.   A credit
and project summary, including a breakdown of costs, is contained in Annex III,
and the project area is shown on the attached map (IBRD 11682). The project
is based on a feeder road feasibility study prepared by French consultants
Bureau Central pour les Equipements d'Outre-Mer (BCEOM), and on the findings
of an IDA appraisal mission. Field appraisal took place in January/February
1975. Negotiations were held in Washington on October 28-31, 1975. The Malian
delegation was led by the Minister of Transport and Public Works.
Project Description
29.       The proposed Third Highway Project provides essentially for follow-
up operations to the improvement of road maintenance and of agricultural
feeder roads, efforts which were initiated under the First and Second Highway
Projects. The project consists of: (i) continuation over 3-1/2 years of a
program for improvement of about 1,200 km of feeder roads in the most pro-
ductive cotton and groundnut areas including the purchase of two ferries for
river crossing on the two most trafficked feeder roads; (ii) a 3-year program
for elimination of the backlog of periodic maintenance on about 944 km of paved
roads, as well as procurement of spare parts and the construction and equip-
ment of two new DPW maintenance subdivision workshops; (iii) procurement of
office equipment, teaching materials, and vehicles for the Training Center of



-9
the Department of Public Works (DPW); and (iv) consulting services for (a)
technical assistance to DPW for implementation of the feeder road improvement
and the backlog maintenance programs, (b) preparation of a training program
for the DPW Center and training teaching staff, and (c) preparation of a
study to establish a countrywide transport plan.
30.       The total cost of the project (including $2.2 million taxes and
duties) is estimated at US$13.4 million equivalent, of which US$8.4 million
in foreign costs (63 percent). The proposed Credit of US$10.0 million would
finance the entire foreign cost of the project and US$1.6 miliion of the local
costs, equivalent to about 89 percent of total project costs net of taxes.
The Government would finance the remaining local costs of about US$1.2 million
equivalent.
Project Execution
31.       Execution of the project will be primarily the responsibility of
DPW, with its sister department, the National Transport Office (ONT), in charge
of transport planning and organization, being responsible for preparation of
the transport plan. The feeder road improvement and backlog maintenance works
will be executed by DPW's own forces established under the two previous high-
way projects. The planned schedule is as follows: improvement of feeder roads,
January 1975 - mid-1978; elimination of backlog maintenance, January 1976 -
December 1978 with some training in 1975; consulting services for technical
assistance and the transport plan study, 1976-78. Since the Government haa
kept feeder road improvement works going with its own funds after January 1,
1975, it is recommended that the Association provide retroactive financing
for expenditures incurred for this project component prior to Board presenta-
tion, in an amount estimated at US$900,000. Retroactive financing should al30
be provided for about 10-months of technical assistance expected to be pro-
vided during 1975, at an estimated cost of US$100,000 and for the purchase
of some materials necessary for the training of the bituminous road mainten-
ance brigade (maximum US$100,000). All consultants for the proposed project
will be employed on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association.
32.       To avoid delays in the progress of work under this project due to
lack of liquidity of the Road Fund, a revolving fund of US$500,000 will be
opened in a local bank immediately after the date of effectiveness of the
credit. The Government will be allowed to use this account for expenditures
for the project eligible for financing under the proposed credit. (See
Section 2.02, para b) through e) of draft Credit Agreement.
Procurement and Disbursement
33.       The two ferries (US$0.6 million) which are simple in construction
and have to be assembled at the site would not be attractive to suppliers
outside those currently established in Mali. They will therefore be procured
on the basis of local competitive bidding. Bitumen (US$2.3 million) may be
purchased from a refinery in Ivory Coast. This procurement method provides
the best transport advantage and will be acceptable to the Association as
long as the prices obtained are in line with international price standards.



- 10 -
Contracts for fuel (US$1 million) and other items estimated to cost less than
US$20,000 each (US$0.3 million in total), may be let oni the basis of the
Borrower's standard procurement procedures provided these procedures shall
continue to be acceptable to the Association. The four vehicles for the
training center and the spare parts for the Highway Equipment Pool (US$0.6
million) will be procured from licensed dealers at list prices which are
reasonable. Details of these arrangements have been agreed upon with the
Government.
34.       Disbursements from the proposed Credit will finance 75 percent of
expenditures for feeder road improvement and for backlog maintenance operations
and will be made on the basis of applications submitted by the Government in-
dicating in detail all work carried out and expenditures incurred. The Asso-
ciation will also finance 75 percent of the cost of the office equipment,
teaching materials and vehicles, for the DPW training center and for consult-
ing services.
Benefits and Justification
35.       Benefits of the feeder road and maintenance elements of the proposed
project will be perceived in lower vehicle operating costs and increased
agricultural production, and overall improved efficiency of the road trans-
port industry. Further, all works will be executed by DPW which will use this
opportunity to strengthen the organizational structure built up under previous
projects financed by the Association.
36.       The economic return on the feeder road component of the project is
estimated at almost 17 percent; even with an increase in all costs or a re-
duction of benefits of 25 percent; the return is still about 10 percent. The
backlog maintenance element of the project has a benefit/cost ratio of more
than 3 at 12 percent interest.

C.   Projects in Execution
Credit 197-MLI First Highway Project. US$7.7 million Credit of June 17,
1970; Closing Date March 31, 1976
The Project consists of a 4-year program for highway maintenance
and betterment of 1,450 km of feeder roads, and feasibility study and detailed
engineering of the Faladie-Segou and Bamako-Bougouni roads.
The Project started in October 1970, and was scheduled for completion
in September 1975, but the Government had already used up all the Credit funds
after completion of about 500 km of feeder roads by the end of 1974. The
Government also procured all goods and services and improved the organization
and execution of road maintenance but did not have enough funds to keep the
equipment operational at all times because of the high cost increases resulting
from the energy crisis and worldwide inflation.
Credit 277-MLI Mopti Rice Development Project. US$9.5 million Credit of
January 6, 1972 (as amended on April 11, 1975); Closing Date
May 31, 1978
Starting in early 1972 after intial delays, the project is progressing
satisfactorily. The construction and disbursements schedules are in line with
appraisal estimates, but, following the US dollar devaluations, provisions for
some additional works and sharp price increases, estimated total project costs
have increased by US$3.6 million equivalent.
An amendment to the Credit Agreement, providing supplementary IDA
financing of US$2.6 million was approved on January 28, 1975. The amendment
became effective on August 7, 1975; all the US$6.9 million under the original
credit has been disbursed.
Credit 321-MLI Telecommunications Project. US$3.6 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Closing Date July 1, 1976
The implementation of the project is about 2 years behind schedule
mainly due to poor OPTM management. Bids for the two main project components
have been recently evaluated by the consultant and ITU (International Tele-
communications Union) Headquarters. Based on these evaluations, total pro-
ject costs appear to have increased from US$4.3 million (US$3.1 million in
foreign exchange) at appraisal time to US$9.3 million (US$7.3 million in
foreign exchange); this is mainly due to the combined effect of an optimistic
original cost estimate, delays, unforseen inflation, lack of international
competition, and currency realignments.



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 5
Steps have been taken to seek additional sources of financing and
the staff is now looking at a possible co-financing arrangement with Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique. OPTM's financial position is still weak
mainly because of increase of billing delays and Government's arrears in
settling its debts to OPTM. However, from recent discussion with Fovern-
ment's officials, we expect that measures will be taken to improve OPTM's
management and financial situation.
Credit 383-MLI Second Highway Project. US$17.8 million Credit of May 23,
1973 (as amended on June 12, 1975); Closing Date July 19, 1977
Two items of the Project, partial rehabilitation of the Bamako-
Bougouni road and procurement of highway equipment, are being financed with
USAID assistance. The Project portion financed by IDA consists of: (i) re-
habilitation of the Faladie-Segou road; (ii) consultants' services for super-
vision of road construction, additional technical assistance to the DPW for
road maintenance and feeder road improvement, and detailed engineering of the
Bamako-Kolokani road; (iii) procurement of highway equipment.
In October 1974, the Government awarded a US$11.8 million contract
for the construction of the Faladie-Sdgou road, main item of IDA portion of
the Project, but the total cost of this road, including contingencies, is now
estimated at US$25 million, because of unexpected inflation and the need for
total rather than partial strengthening which was foreseen at appraisal time.
An amendment to the Credit Agreement providing supplementary IDA financing of
US$8.3 million was therefore approved on June 3, 1975 and became effective on
October 29, 1975. Construction has started but there are some delays because
of late arrival of equipment.
Credit 384-MLI Second Railway Project. US$6.7 million Credit of May 23
1973; Closing Date June 30, 1978
The project was expected to cost a total of about US$9.33 million,
with IDA participation of US$6.7 million, FAC-financing of US$1.8 equivalent,
the rest being provided under Railway's own financing. Bidding results dis-
closed a cost overrun of about US$3.5 million in the foreign exchange com-
ponent of the project. The cost overrun was caused by (a) low original
estimates; (b) sharp increases in world market prices; and (c) the fact that
only single bids were received for some items. Additional bilateral financing
obtained for part of the freight cars proposed under the project (Germany and
France) and of the technical assistance (Canada) partly offset the cost over-
run. However, several items included in the project had to be deleted or
significantly reduced.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 5
Execution of the Second Project is being carried out according to
schedule. Operating performance is satisfactory, and operating targets have
been met. A training program is well under way.
The financial situation of the Railway remained tight because of
delays in implementing tariff increases recommended by the Bank. However,
rates have now been raised as necessary, and the Railway is expected to meet
appraisal financial targets in 1975.
Credit 420-MLI First Education Project. US$5.0 million Credit of July 11,
1973; Closing Date December 31, 1979
Preliminary design work has been completed for all construction
items. Tender documents for the Central School for Industry and Commerce
(middle level technician training) have already been sent to IDA and approved
equipment lists are now under review by the Bank. According to mission es-
timates, the cost overruns in implementing the original program of the lower
secondary science technology centers would be about 70 percent over appraisal
estimates on construction and about 50 percent on furniture and equipment.
However, a revised plan, based on a smaller number of centers has been pro-
posed to the government which must now determine the sites. Curriculum
development work for the new science/technology programs has in general pro-
ceeded according to schedule but needs to be complemented by teacher training
and upgrading, for which few national staff have the training and experience
required. The study of alternatives for basic education is off to a promising
start with strong support from national staff.
Credit 443-MLI Drought Relief Project. US$2.5 million Credit of December
7, 1973; Closing Date June 30, 1976
Despite some delays and procurement difficulties, the project is
proceeding satisfactorily. 24 sub-projects have been approved by IDA. Work
is well under way on most sub-projects and some are already completed. Some
of the sub-projects will have to be reduced due to currency realignments
and price increases making the US$2.5 million insufficient to cover all the
expenditures originally scheduled. More than 60 percent of the credit amount
has already been disbursed.
Credit 491-MLI Integrated Rural Development Project. US$8.0 million Credit
of July 1, 1974; Closing Date September 30, 1978
The Credit will help improve principal farming activities especially
the production of groundnuts and staple cereals in the west central part of
Mali. It includes provision for extension and credit services; rural track
improvement; agricultural research; functional literacy; medical and veterinary
facilities; and an evaluating unit. The project will also finance a study on
millet/sorghum price structure and marketing arrangements. Some initial delays
have occurred, but the project is now progressing satisfactorily.

Credit 538-MLI Livestock Project. US$13.3 million Credit of April 11, 1975;
Closing Date December 31, 1979
The Project aims at the rational use of land and water in the Fifth
Region and will help rebuilding and improving herds of about 100,000 pastoral
families in the Fifth Region to better protect them against future droughts.
It includes provision for livestock extension services and grazing control;
animal health services; construction of 70 wells and 50 ponds; construction
of an abattoir and hide-drying facilities; construction for five livestock
markets; functional literacy; and the preparation of a second phase livestock
project. This Credit became effective on July 24, 1975.

Procurement              The two ferries (US$0.6 million) which are simple
Arrangements:           in construction and have to be assembled at the site
would not be attractive to suppliers outside those
currently established in Mali. They will therefore
be procured on the basis of local competitive bid-
ding. Bitumen (US$2.3 million) may be purchased
from a refinery in Ivory Coast.  This procurement
method provides the best transport advantage and
will be acceptable to the Association as long as
the prices obtained are in line with international
price standards. Contracts for fuel (US$1 million)
and other items estimated to cost less than US$20,000
each (US$0.3 million in total), may be let on the
basis of the Borrower's standard procurement proce-
dures provided these procedures shall continue to
be acceptable to the Association. The four vehicles
for the training center and the spare parts for the
Highway Equipment Pool (US$0.6 million) will be
procured from licensed dealers at list prices which
are reasonable. Details of these arrangements have
been agreed upon with the Government.
Consultants:             Consultants for technical assistance would be arranged
according to procedures acceptable to IDA 135 man-
months of consultants services would be financed under
the Credit to assist the DPW and the ONI of the Ministry
of Transport and Public Works (see para. 29).
Economic Evaluation:     The internal economic return of the feeder road com-
ponent is estimated at almost 17 percent. The
benefit/cost ratio on the backlog maintenance element
is estimated at more than 3. This is equivalent to
a rate of return of about 120 percent.
