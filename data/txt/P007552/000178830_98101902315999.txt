SMALL-SCALE AGRICULTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                   Nacional Financiera, S.A.
Guarantor:                  United Mexican States.
Project Executing
4  Agency:                   Secretariat of Agriculture and Water Resources
(SARH).
Amount:                     US$60 million equivalent.
Terms:                      Repayable in 17 years, including 4 years of
grace at an interest rate of 7.35 percent
per annum.
Project
Description:              The project would promote increased agricultural
and livestock production through the execution of
about 250 irrigation, drainage and livestock
subprojects:
Infrastructure             Area benefited
Sub-projects for                 (ha)
Irrigation                      56,000
Tubewells                    (36,000)
Storage dams                 (12,000)
Pumping from rivers          ( 8,000)
Drainage                        36,000
Livestock raising               58,000
Some 30,000 low-income families would directly
benefit from project works. Average annual family
income for beneficiaries of irrigation and drainage
projects is expected to increase from about US$500
before the project to about US$2,300 at full devel-
opment four to five years later. Incomes of
beneficiaries of the livestock development sub-
projects are expected to increase from an estimated
average level of about US$200 without the project
to about US$1,400 at full development, eight to
ten years later.

INTERNATIONAL BAqK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVFLOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.A.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR A SMALL-SCALE AGRICULTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Nacional Financiera, S.A. with the guarantee of United Mexican States
for the equivalent of US$60 million to help finance small agricultural
infrastructure works under a national plan being implemented by the Secretariat
of Agriculture and Water Resources. The loan would be repaid over 17 years,
including 4 years of grace, with interest at 7.35 percent per annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        Some of the major features of the Mexican economy were analyzed in
"An Updating Report on the Economy of Mexico" (1110-ME), distributed to the
Executive Directors on March 23, 1976. A special economic mission visited
Mexico in April-May 1977 and its report is now in the final stages of prepar-
ation. The discussion which follows reflects the preliminary findings of the
mission.
Past Performance
3.        For most of the three decades preceding the mid-seventies, Mexico
was outstandingly successful in achieving rapid economic growth while main-
taining stability in prices and the balance of payments. From 1940 to 1970,
average GDP growth exceeded 6 percent per year in real terms, inflation
averaged less than 5 perce!nt per year from the mid-1960s to 1972, and the
dollar value of the peso, fixed in 1954, was maintained until the September
1976 devaluation. The Government's role in this achievement was to carry
out direct investments in infrastructure and in key industries such as power,
steel and petroleum, while creating a stable regulatory and institutional
framework, as well as goocl profit prospects, to induce private sector growth.
4.        This strategy produced rapid growth, but led to a sharpening of
contrasts within the Mexican economy. While land redistribution under the
reform of 1915 was continued, most of the peasants who received land could not
improve their economic staitus in the absence of basic infrastructure, credit
and technical assistance. Rapid population growth made social equity even
more difficult to achieve. Population growth in Mexico accelerated steadily,
primarily as a result of reduced death rates, and reached 3.5 percent per
year by 1970. Despite economic growth, the high demographic growth rate made
adequate absorption of the labor force in productive employment difficult.
Some 40 percent of the labor force is either relatively unproductive and
poorly paid, or openly unemployed.



- 2 -
5.        During the 1970s, Mexico experienced increasing public sector
deficits, inflation, large balance of payments deficits, capital flight
and a marked slowdown in the real rate of growth of GDP, which dropped
to 2 percent in 1976--the lowest annual growth rate experienced by Mexico
since the mid-thirties. On September 1, 1976 the authorities abandoned
the fixed exchange rate of 12.50 pesos per dollar that had remained unchanged
since 1954 and let the peso float; in recent months it has remained rather
stable at rates fluctuating between 22 and 23 pesos per dollar. Following
the devaluation, Mexico obtained major support from the IMF.  In the last
quarter of 1976, Mexico was able to draw on the Fund for US$480 million.
For 1977-79, an Extended Fund Facility accompanied by a comprehensive three-
year stabilization program was negotiated. The new Government ratified the
agreement with the IMF shortly after taking office on December 1, 1976, and
to date has complied with the program agreed upon with the IMF.
Current Economic Policy
6.        The present Government inherited a difficult situation upon taking
office on December 1, 1976. High inflation, large public sector deficits, in-
creasing foreign indebtedness and lack of confidence in economic management
indicated a need for economic stabilization. However, the situation also
called for more expansionary policies; economic activity had slowed down, net
private investment was virtually nil, and the gap between new job creation and
growth of the labor force was increasing. High world prices for petroleum
offered profitable investment opportunities in the petroleum sector; indeed,
increased production for export of these products seemed by far the best
way to meet a large part of Mexico's high debt service requirements in the
coming years.
7.        Faced with these conflicting needs and opportunities, the Mexican
authorities adopted a mixed strategy aimed at reducing lower-priority public
expenditures and increasing public revenues, while proceeding with petroleum
and other high-priority investments. The objectives of the Government's
program include control of inflation together with a return to high rates
of economic growth. Better management of public sector expenditures, more
rational pricing and cost control in public sector enterprises, promotion
of private savings, limiting wage increases to justifiable levels, and more
effective cooperation with the private sector are important parts of the
Government's economic strategy.
8.        The measures instituted by the new Administration have already
produced good results. Inflation during the first semester of 1978 slowed
to 18 percent on an annual basis as compared to 31 percent during the same
period of 1977. The deficit in the current account of the balance of payments
declined from US$3.5 billion in 1976 to US$2.2 billion in 1977, and total
public sector financial requirements dropped from 10.3 percent of GDP in
1976 to 7.9 percent in 1977. Mobilization of savings by the banking system
is increasing, and the economy is recovering at a strong pace. The GDP rate
of growth may exceed 6 percent in 1978 as opposed to less than 3 percent
in 1977.



- 3-
Economic Issues and Prosoects
9.        The Mexican authorities have adopted a comprehensive social
program aimed at strengthening the political system, improving income dis-
tribution and the living conditions of the poor, increasing public sector
efficiency and accelerating growth. The program takes into account two
overriding economic priorities--energy development and adequate supplies
of foodstuffs--and takes the form of a three stage economic strategy. The
first stage--the stabilization period--is being devoted to overcome the
serious economic problems the new Government inherited. The second stage
would be devoted to establishing the basis for attaining a high, equitable
and stable rate of growth. During this stage--1979-80--efforts will be
made to overcome supply bottlenecks, increase agricultural production,
improve the marketing system, increase the efficiency and competitiveness
of the country's industrial sector and create the conditions necessary for
a more just distribution of the benefits of growth. Accelerated and equit-
able growth would be the characteristics of the third stage.
10.       Mexico has the human, institutional and natural resources necessary
to attain these ambitious goals. The short-run disequilibria that have
affected the country duriLng the mid-70s have been brought under control;
the new petroleum riches and the country's ability to exploit them have
greatly relaxed the financial constraints on growth. In his last State of the
Union speech President Lopez Portillo announced that Mexico's present oil and
gas reserves amounted to 20 billion barrels on July 31, 1979 and that probable
and potential reserves amounted to 37 billion and 120 billion barrels, respec-
tively. Exploitation of these reserves would allow Mexico to increase produc-
tion of crude oil and natural gas liquids from 894,000 bbl/day in 1976 to
about 2.8 million bbl/day in 1982 and to export the equivalent of about 1.6
million bbl/day of crude oil in 1982 (for approximately US$9.0 billion on the
basis of conservative pr:Lce assumptions), not counting possible gas exports.
11.       The challenge ahead is how to use these vast riches to help resolve
Mexico's long-term development problems which include the following:
(i) Population and Poverty. Many Mexican families have not partici-
pated in the sustained economic growth of the last several
decades. As of 1975, about 4 million Mexican families--45
percent of the total--receive incomes equal to less than
one-half the national average. The members of most of these
families work--more than half of them in agriculture--but
they produce little and receive little. Mexico's labor force
is now growing at about 3.2 percent per year, which implies
an average annual increase by some 550,000 workers during
1975-80; during the 1960s the growth rate was 2.7 percent
per year. The challenge of providing productive jobs for
both new entrants and existing underproductive workers is
awesome.



- 4-
(ii) Stagnation in Agriculture. Crop and livestock production
in Mexico, which had grown by 6 percent per year during
1945-55 and 4.2 percent per year during 1955-65, grew at
only 2.1 percent per year during 1965-75, resulting in
increased imports of corn and wheat.
(iii) Regional Imbalances. The heavy concentration of people,
production, and public services in the Mexico City area--
which has currently a population of about 12 million and
is growing at over 5 percent each year--and the scarcity
of productive employment and services for rural Mexicans
are challenges to urban management, economic development,
and social justice. They imply diversion of some of Mexico
City's future growth to other regions, as well as the
gradual concentration of scattered rural populations into
small towns so that basic public services could be provided
more economically and productive activities would have a
better chance of developing;
(iv) Mobilization of Domestic Savings. Past failures to mobilize
enough domestic resources to pay for public sector spending
have left Mexico with a large foreign debt and a large public
sector deficit. The increase in export revenues that is
expected from petroleum and related products should increase
public sector savings, alleviate the foreign debt problem and
greatly ease the foreign exchange constraint. But larger
domestic savings would be required to reduce the still high
public sector deficit and provide financing for additional
government programs.
12.       In the medium term the prospects for resumption of economic growth
with relative price stability are good. Poverty will remain a problem but
the Government is taking steps to address it. The alleviation of the external
constraint on growth brought about by the expected petroleum earnings (para.
15), together with the Government's efforts to increase public sector savings
and to stimulate private investment, could produce economic growth of 7 to 8
percent per year in the remaining four years of the present Administration.
Resumption of economic growth combined with the intensification of the
Government's family planning program (on October 28, 1.977 President Lopez
Portillo announced the ambitious goal of reducing the population growth to
2.5 percent per year by 1982, then progressively to 1.8 percent by 1988, 1.3
percent by 1994, and 1 percent by the year 2000), the new emphasis on rainfed
agriculture, and the implementation of specific programs aimed at increasing
productive employment should help to address the structural problems mentioned
above.
13.       In agriculture, the current administration has undertaken a far-
reaching administrative reform that will allow broader and more effective
Government action in the sector. Emphasis is laid on productivity gains
and yield increases in both irrigated and rainfed areas. The previous goal
of self-sufficiency in agricultural goods is being rephrased in terms of



the sector's overall capacity to pay for its own imports. Irrigation is
fostered through a nationwide program for small irrigation and drainage works
and rehabilitation of existing irrigation districts to increase efficiency
of water use. The new ernphasis on rainfed agriculture, relatively neglected
in the past, should lead to an increase in the productive potential of vast
areas currently under-exploited and to a reversal of the past t-ends towards
larger income disparities between the modern and traditional agricultural
subsectors. These initiatives, together with the more realistic exchange
rate, promise a resumption of growth in production for both domestic and
export markets and an improvement in the living conditions of the rural poor.
14.       Industry has potential for considerable growth in many sectors,
including import substituation in chemicals, petrochemicals and capital
goods as well as exports of many different manufactured products. Increases
in tourism export earnings are also expected.
15.       Among the benefits of recent public sector investments are the
new possibilities opened to the Mexican economy through the discoveries of
rich petroleum fields. The Government has decided to use these large hydro-
carbon resources to help manage Mexico's heavy debt service burden and to
enhance the country's development prospects. The additional domestic demand
likely to occur due to the large planned increase in Government expenditures
associated with increased public investment and programs aimed at increasing
employment and the productivity of the poor will have to be satisfied partially
through increased imports. Net interest payments are likely to increase
in the future given the rapid increase in foreign debt which occurred during
the last sexennio and the borrowing expected to take place in the years to
come. However, rapidly increasing petroleum exports and favorable prospects
regarding tourism earnings, the recovery of agricultural exports and resump-
tion of growth of manufactured exports have strengthened the balance of pay-
ments outlook and will keep the current account deficit at reasonable levels.
16.       Mexico's debt service ratio has been increasing over the recent past
and reached 48 percent in 1977. This comparatively high debt service ratio is
more a reflection of the low level of exports relative to GNP and the high
proportion of Mexican borrowing from commercial banks than it is an indication
of a high level of external debt relative to the size of the economy. When
middle income developing countries are ranked by the ratio of external public
debt to GNP, Mexico ranks as average. The debt service ratio is expected to
peak at slightly over 50 percent in 1978 and, mainly as a result of the rapid
expansion of petroleum exports, decline sharply to levels of around 30 percent
in the early 1980's. Debt service on Bank loans amounts to about 4 percent of
public debt service; this ratio is projected to decrease over the next two
years and to increase to some extent afterwards. The Bank currently holds
about 8 percent of Mexico's total medium- and long-term public debt, and
this ratio is likely to increase somewhat over the next few years. Mexico
remains creditworthy for borrowing on conventional terms considering the
country's excellent medium- and long-term potential and the well conceived
economic strategy which the Government has adopted to realize it.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MEXICO
Bank Operations
17.       As of October 31, 1978, Mexico had received 56 loans from the Bank
amounting to US$3,068.9 million net of cancellations and terminations; of
these, 33 loans totalling US$1,486.4 million were fully disbursed. The Bank
held US$2,553.8 million of which US$1,114.4 million had not yet been disbursed
and of which US$494.5 million have been recently approved and are not yet
effective. Some 39 percent of Bank lending has been for agriculture and rural
development (18 loans for US$1,204.4 million), 23 percent for power (12 loans
for US$704.8 million) and 18 percent for transportation projects (12 loans for
US$546.7 million); the remaining 20 percent has been for industry (US$352.5
million), water supply (US$130 million), tourism (US$114 million), and urban
development (US$16.5 million) projects. Mexico is carrying out a stabiliza-
tion program, and because of scarcity of counterpart funds some projects fell
behind schedule in 1976 and 1977. Following review with the Government, a
steel loan was terminated (Sec M77-258 of April 5, 1977), the scope of an
irrigation project was reduced and US$100 million from the original US$150
million loan were cancelled (R77-305 of December 13, 1977) and the scope of
several other projects has been modified. Adequate budget support for the
ongoing projects has now been secured. Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans as of October 31, 1978 and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
IFC Operations
18.       As of October 31, 1978, IFC has made 17 investment commitments in
Mexico, for a total of US$202.4 million, of which US$128.6 million had been
sold, repaid or cancelled. The balance held by the Corporation, US$73.8
million, consists of US$64 million in loans and US$9.8 million in equity.
A summary statement of IFC investments as of October 31, 1978 is presented in
Annex II.
Bank Strategy
19.       The main objectives of Bank lending in Mexico have been to:
(i) support policies and programs leading to a wider distribution of the
benefits of economic growth; (ii) strengthen policies and programs leading
to continued economic growth by helping to finance projects that are to make
directly or indirectly significant contributions to output, exports, and
employment; and (iii) help resolve critical adjustment problems that Mexico
is currently facing. The Bank is preferentially supporting projects of high
social priority that help the rural or urban poor, projects that promote
higher levels of employment and production, and those that help to
decentralize economic activity.



20.       Because of the difficult structural problems of Mexico's agriculture
and the sector's crucia]L importance to the country's further development,
the Bank has made agriculture the leading sector for its lending. The Bank
agricultural lending program for Mexico has four goals: first, to increase
productivity of present]Ly-cultivated lands through selected programs of irri-
gation rehabilitation and on-farm improvements; second, to improve the pro-
ductivity of small farmers who receive the benefit of most Bank lending
through programs for (a) rural development, (b) rainfed agricultural develop-
ment (c) bringing new areas under cultivation, and (d) establishing irrigation
and drainage units; third, to complement infrastructure investments with
general support services including agricultural extension and marketing
programs and provision of medium-term credit; and fourth, to promote off-farm
employment opportunities in rural areas through programs of agro- and rural-
industries. The Bank has made seven loans in FY's 72 through 77, totalling
US$579 million, for irr:Lgation, rural development and agriculture and livestock
credit programs. A US$56 mil]ion loan for an agricultural development project
designed to intensify agricultural production in Mexico's humid tropics and a
US$200 million loan for an agricultural credit project were approved by the
Executive Directors in FY78. A US$25 million supplemental loan for the Rio
Panuco Irrigation Project was recently approved. Besides the proposed small-
scale infrastructure project, future Bank lending for agriculture includes
projects for rehabilitatLion of irrigation districts, water control, rural
development and support services.
21.       Bank lending for industry has been aimed at assisting the Govern-
ment's efforts to reduces the balance of payments deficit and decentralize
industrial activities away from the major (and increasingly congested) urban
areas. Thus, a major steel project has recently started operating in a
previously underdeveloped area on the west coast of Mexico, and a fertilizer
project promotes new poles of development in the resource-rich southeast
region and the north central area. A project to promote the development of
small- and medium-scale enterprises and a third industrial equipment fund
project were approved by the Executive Directors in FY78.  A fertilizer
project is currently being processed for submission to the Executive Directors
in the coming months, and a capital goods industry project is under study.
22.       As regards infrastructure, the Bank's operations have been focused
on investments in key areas of the country as well as on institutional reforms
and sector policies aiming, inter alia, at suitable pricing mechanisms to
help generate additional resources for investment financing. The airports
development project (FY74) was designed to support the Government's policy
of regional integration; the third railway project (FY76) supported improve-
ments of institutional aspects and financial management of the sector. The
Mexico City (FY73) and medium cities (FY76) water supply projects have been
instrumental in the establishment of specialized institutions for efficient
provision of drinking water and in the pricing of water at levels more closely
related to costs. A highway sector loan which would help finance a high prior-
ity modernization and expansion of the highway network is being processed for
submission to the Executive Directors in the coming months, and a regional
airports project is under study.



23.       The Government and the Bank have long recognized the regional
economic disparities prevailing in Mexico. In June 1976 the Government
adopted the Law of Human Settlements to provide a new institutional framework
to deal with the pressing problems of over concentration of economic activi-
ties in the larger metropolitan areas, and several projects are now being
prepared to meet the needs for basic urban services for poor families in
selected priority cities. One such project, to assist in the development of
the Lazaro Cardenas conurbation area, was recently approved by the Executive
Directors, and another project for the southeast part of the country is under
study.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Background
24.       During the period 1945-1965, agricultural output grew at a rate of
more than 5 percent per annum. Since the mid-1960s, however, the growth in
production of crops in general and of cereals in particular has fallen below
the growth in domestic demand, while livestock production, accounting for
about one-third of the sector's output, has been growing consistently around 5
percent per annum.
25.       More than 22 million of Mexico's 62 million population live in
rural areas. About 40 percent of the national labor force is engaged in
agriculture, forestry or fishing; the sector accounts for over one-third
of commodity exports. Although agriculture provides important inputs for
industry, its share in gross domestic production has declined from 19 percent
in the 1930s to below 10 percent in the late 1970s. The rural population
comprises three distinct groups of nearly equal size: (i) landless workers,
(ii) private landholders; and (iii) ejidatarios. 1/ The number of landless
families is increasing rapidly because of limited availability of farm land,
even though almost half of the new entrants to the labor force migrate to the
city.
26.       The Mexican agricultural sector is marked by wide disparities in
resource endowment, technology, productivity, and income. While between 1915
and 1965 over half of Mexico's arable and pasture lands were distributed to
landless families under a pioneering agrarian reform program, the land varies
considerably in quality and productive potential from the arid north to the
tropical isthmus. Mexico has been a leader in applied agricultural research,
but the link with the farmer has been weak; as a result, most small farmers
! ve not fully benefitted from modern technology. Access to public services,
credit and infrastructure has been uneven. Together, these factors have
resulted in a sharp duality in Mexican agriculture. One third of Mexico's
cultivated area produces two-thirds of Mexico's agricultural goods. Farmers
1/   Ejidatarios are members of an ejido, which is a form of group land
tenure based on usufruct.

in the irrigated zones and a selected number of rainfed agricultural zones
have developed into procluctive rural entrepreneurs, but most of Mexico's small
farmers work by traditional methods, subsist on a modicum of production from
their farms, and barely participate in the market economy. In an effort to
correct this imbalance, the Government is intensifying technical, promotional,
and organizational assistance to farmers and is concentrating lublic investment
in agriculture on programs benefitting the small farmer and ejidatario.
Government's Policies and Program
27.       The agricultural policy of the Mexican Government has in recent
years focused on increasing production of basic food crops (maize, wheat and
rice) so as to attain self-sufficiency and on raising incomes and living
standards for the poorer sections of the rural population.
28.       The Government:'s strategy for increasing agricultural production
includes measures to increase the cropped area and to increase the productivity
of lands currently being cropped. To increase the area devoted to basic food
crops, the Government is bringing new lands into production and is stimulating
changes in cropping patterns. Development of new rainfed lands is getting
underway mainly in the humid tropical zone, where a largely underutilized area
of about 8 million ha is estimated to have medium to high agricultural potential.
In the short term, development of new lands under irrigation would take place
mainly under the national program for small-scale infrastructure. In selected
cases, medium and large projects are also being undertaken. To induce changes
in cropping patterns that would help offset the decreased area devoted to wheat
and maize during recent years, the Government has recently increased the
guarantee prices of these two crops relative to sorghum and soybeans.
29.       The present administration is placing significant emphasis on programs
to increase farm productivity. A program to rehabilitate those irrigation
districts where infrastructure is inadequate or where lands are in poor condi-
tion has been expanded with important financial support from the Mexican
banking community and the participating farmers. Increasing attention is
being given to development of the potential of rainfed agriculture. The 110
recently established raiLnfed agricultural districts would promote the adoption
of modern technology and would be the basis for strengthening the delivery of
technical assistance and marketing services to farmers. Such programs are
complemented by other public investments to improve the incomes and employment
levels of the rural poor. The most important of these is the national Invest-
ment Program for Rural Development (PIDER) which provides a balanced package
of directly productive, support, and social infrastructure to residents of
Mexico's poorest rural zones.
30.       Thus the Government's agricultural development strategy is to provide
access to modern farming techniques for a higher proportion of its rural popula-
tion. The strategy calls for investments by the Government in education,
applied research and extension as well as in physical infrastructure for
access roads, land clearing, marketing and storage facilities, drainage and



- 10 -
irrigation. At the same time, the Government would stimulate private invest-
ment through the credit institutions. The Bank is supporting the Government's
strategy in both these areas. The tropical agricultural development project,
approved by the Executive Directors in FY78, finances part of the Government's
program to open the humid tropical areas to intensive use. In addition,
projects for irrigation, drainage and improvement of the agricultural extension
and marketing systems are under study. The sixth agricultural credit project,
approved by the Executive Directors in FY78, supports private investment in
agriculture and agroindustries. The proposed project would continue Bank
support of the Government strategy by providing infrastructure and technology
necessary for small farmers to significantly increase their productivity.
The Small-Scale Infrastructure Program
31.       In order to bring the benefits of irrigation to small farmers in
scattered regions of the nation at a reasonable cost, the Government in
1967 established a national plan for small-scale irrigation and created a
specialized agency within the Secretariat of Water Resources to implement
the plan. This agency, now known as the General Directorate for Hydraulic
Works and Agricultural Engineering for Rural Development (OHDR), was successful
in developing a technical and managerial plan for developing localized water
resources for irrigation at reasonable costs.
32.       The program was later diversified to include drainage infrastructure.
Drainage works are concentrated in those zones where high levels of peak rain-
fall make agriculture risky and cause farmers to use their lands for natural
pastures at a low level of productivity. Small-scale drainage sub-projects
typically include land clearing and improving the discharge capacity of a
natural water course. The technical assistance provided under the program
helps to ensure a productive response from sub-project investments.
33.       OHDR's program was further enlarged in 1976 when it absorbed
the Department of Rural Engineering of the former Secretariat of Agriculture
and Livestock. The revised program is called The National Plan for Small
Scale Agricultural Infrastructure Development (PNDR) and includes in addition
to the irrigation and drainage works a program for livestock infrastructure
works. This consists of improving natural pastures and establishing animal
watering points, stables, corrals and fences. Livestock infrastructure
sub-projects would be concentrated in those ejidos where most of the land is
either unused or devoted to subsistence agriculture, where productivity of the
land cannot be improved through irrigation or drainage, and where the land is
suitable only for livestock development. This program provides a strategy to
increase the income level of a large number of poor families presently at
subsistence level.
34.       Users' Associations.  A key feature of the program is organization
of beneficiaries into a Users' Association which after completion of the
feasibility study for the sub-project, and before project execution is under-
taken by the Government, enters into a Participation Agreement establishing
the users' responsibility for administration, operation and maintenance of the
project. It also establishes the users' share in project financing which is
equivalent to 30 percent of total project cost. The Subdirectorate for
Supervision of Rural Development (SUDR) provides the Users' Associations
advice and technical assistance in the operation and maintenance of the units.



- 11 -
35.       The program has been successful in bringing significant increases
in family income to pariticipating farmers. The program has largely been
supported by the IDB, which has made 11 loans amounting to $225 million to
assist in financing a total investment of $547 million in small-scale irriga-
tion projects. The Bankc's two loans for PIDER aggregating $230 million also
provide significant support to this program.
36.       During the first decade of this program for small infrastructure
works, over 360,000 ha owned by 156,000 families were brought under irri-
gated cultivation.  In ]L978, the program will develop irrigation works serving
about 61,000 ha and benefitting 19,000 families.  Currently, of the 5 million
ha under irrigation in Mexico, 1.1 million ha are served by small irrigation
works.  By the year 2000, the Government proposes to double the irrigated
area to 10 million ha; of the new 5 million ha to be brought under irrigation,
33 to 40 percent would be developed under the small-scale infrastructure
program. For the period 1977-82, PNDR is expected to develop infra-
structure serving 570,0()0 ha and benefitting about 200,000 families. The
projected breakdown of the total area is:
Type of Infrastructure Works                      Area (ha)
Irrigation                                 350,000
Drainage                                   100,000
Livestock                                  120,000
PART IV - THE PROJECT
37.       The project is a part of this program and would include about 250
irrigation, drainage, and livestock infrastructure sub-projects benefitting
over 30,000 low-income farm families, most of whom would be ejidatarios.
The project would develop intensive irrigated agriculture on about 56,000 ha
through construction of about 170 sub-projects. A total of 36,000 ha would
be served by pumping from deep wells, 12,000 ha would be served from small
storage dams, and 8,000 ha would be served by pumping from rivers. About
40 drainage infrastructure subprojects serving an additional 36,000 ha would
enable more intensive cultivation by reducing flooding and improving water-
logged soils. Nearly 40 livestock infrastructure projects serving 58,000 ha
would allow marginal lands to be used more effectively. The principal invest-
ments in the livestock infrastructure program would be to improve pastures,
animal watering facilities, stables, corrals, and fences.
38.       A Staff Appraisal Report, entitled "Small-Scale Agricultural Infra-
structure Project," No. 2180-ME, dated December 1, 1978 is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. The project was prepared by SARH and
was appraised by a Bank mission in April, 1978. Negotiations took place in
Washington, D.C. on November 14-17, 1978. The Mexican negotiating team
included Lic. A. Galan of Nacional Financiera, S.A. and Ing. H. Bautista of
OHDR.



- 12 -
Project Cost and Finance
39.       As indicated in the Loan and Project Summary, the project is expected
to have a total cost of US$143.7 million of which US$60 million would be in
foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan would be equivalent to the foreign
exchange cost of the project (42 percent of total project cost).  The remainder
would be financed by the Government (49 percent) and project beneficiaries
(9 percent). Beneficiaries would contribute an additional US$6.3 million in
unskilled labor during construction; the value of this non-cash contribution
is not included in the project cost estimates.
Project Implementation
40.       The project would be executed by SARH.  Within SARH, OHDR has
responsibility for planning, evaluating, executing, and supervising PNDR
works and SUDR has responsibility for providing technical assistance to
project beneficiaries and monitoring agricultural development. OHDR in
cooperation with staff from other agencies would prepare a project report for
each proposed sub-project. The project report would contain information on
the social and technical aspects of the sub-project as well as an economic
analysis of the proposed investments. Engineering of the sub-projects would
follow practices and standards developed by OHDR; works would be simple in
design, taking advantage of locally available materials, labor intensive
construction, and lending themselves to easy maintenance by project benefi-
ciaries. Execution of works would be done by contract or, in certain cases,
by force-account. OHDR has a separate supervision division to inspect and
monitor completion of works.
41.       Beneficiary participation in the planning, execution and operation
of project works would be significant. The Users' Association, managed by
an elected committee of beneficiaries, is organized during the early stages
of sub-project preparation. The Association represents the beneficiaries
in negotiations with OHDR regarding sub-project preparation. At the completion
of sub-project evaluation, beneficiaries through the Users' Association enter
into a Participation Agreement with OHDR which establishes the users' share
in project financing and their responsibility for administration, operation,
and maintenance of project works. The Users' Association has proven an
effective means of promoting cooperative action by project beneficiaries,
not only for the management of their infrastructure, but frequently for
the exploitation of their land and marketing as well.
Cost Recovery
42.       The Participation Agreement with each Users' Association would
define the project and who the beneficiaries are, and provide for collection
by the Association of the full operation and maintenance costs of the units
to be constructed under the project. In addition, beneficiaries would pay a
portion of project investment cost determined by the beneficiaries' capacity
to pay and the need to encourage efficient use of the land and water (Section
3.08 of the draft Guarantee Agreement). OHDR's practice is for the benefi-
ciaries to pay 30 percent of the investment cost of a sub-project, the maximum



- 13 -
allowable under the Federal Agrarian Reform Law. For groundwater sub-projects,
this is done through the purchase of pumping equipment (which typically
represents about 30 percent of sub-project investment cost) financed under
normal credit channels. For surface irrigation, drainage or livestock develop-
ment sub-projects, this is done through contribution of unskilled labor and
materials during construction period (up to a maximum of 10 perzent of the
investment cost) and annual cash payments after completion of construction.
Sub-Project Evaluation
43.       OHDR would be responsible for the evaluation of sub-projects to be
included in the project. OHDR performs the analysis using standard assump-
tions agreed to by the Secretariat of Programming and Budgeting and the IDB.
OHDR's cut-off point for sub-project approval is equivalent to an economic
rate of return of about 12 percent. The Bank would review sub-projects prior
to agreeing to finance them (Section 2.02 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Sufficient information would be provided by OHDR to allow the Bank to check
the analysis. In the case of irrigation and drainage sub-projects, the Bank
would normally review a summary of the sub-project report, and only in excep-
tional circumstances review the entire sub-project report. However, for the
livestock sub-projects, the Bank would review the entire sub-project report
(Section 3.07 of the draLft Guarantee Agreement) because of the greater sensi-
tivity of livestock sub-projects to design criteria and because ORDR is less
experienced in designing and executing livestock infrastructure sub-projects
than irrigation or drairnage sub-projects. Only sub-projects with a rate of
return of at least 12 percent would receive assistance under the project.
Monitoring
44.       ORDR would supervise and monitor physical execution of PNDR works.
SUDR would be responsible for monitoring implementation of farm development
plans and for providing technical assistance to Users' Associations. The
developmental impact of the Bank-financed program would be monitored by SUDR
based on a sample of sub-projects with reports submitted annually to the Bank
(Section 3.11 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
45.       Agricultural credit would be provided to project beneficiaries
through the established network of private and public banks. OHDR has entered
into an operating agreement with the National Rural Credit Bank, Banrural, to
provide for Banrural's participation the preparation of farm development plans
and to ensure the provision of adequate credit for beneficiaries' development
programs. Interest rates typically vary from 11 to 17 percent per annum
depending on loan amount: and the beneficiary's income. Repayment terms are
typically five to seven years but are longer where justified by the type of
investment.



- 14 -
Procurement
46.       Because of the small size and dispersed location of works included
in the project, it is expected that construction contracts would not attract
international bidders. Moreover, Mexico has a well developed and competent
construction industry capable of executing works at competitive costs. There-
fore, civil works contracts would be let through the Guarantor's ordinary
procedures which have been reviewed and are acceptable to the Bank. Equipment
for engineering studies, costing US$1.5 million, as well as construction equip-
ment costing US$8.6 million would be procured through international competitive
bidding; domestic manufacturers would be allowed a preference up to 15 percent.
Equipment for on-farm works, pumping plants and livestock development (US$3.7
million) would be purchased in small quantities under local procedures (Sched-
ule 2 to the draft Guarantee Agreement).
Disbursement
47.       As indicated in the Loan and Project Summary, the loan is expected
to be disbursed over the 4-year period mid-1979 through mid-1983. Completion
of on-farm works in livestock development sub-projects would generally require
longer periods of time than the expected disbursement period for the loan;
thus, while execution of these sub-projects would be undertaken on about
58,000 ha, project cost estimates and financial arrangements are based on a
"time-slice" approach covering investment costs incurred during the four-year
project execution period. Livestock development sub-projects approved by the
Bank for inclusion in the project, but not completed during the disbursement
period, could be considered for supplementary financing under a subsequent
Bank-assisted project or would be financed by the Government out of its own
resources.
Project Impact
48.       The project is expected to increase substantially the incomes of
30,000 low-income farm families. Average annual family income for benefi-
ciaries of irrigation and drainage projects is expected to increase from about
US$500 before the project to about US$2,300 at full development four to five
years later. Beneficiaries of the livestock infrastructure component would
include some of the lowest-income land-holders in Mexico who lead a precarious
existence on lands with minimal productive potential; their annual farm
incomes are expected to increase from an estimated average level of about
US$200 without the project to about US$1,400 at full development, eight to ten
years later. To ensure that project benefits would accrue to low-income
farmers and that the number of beneficiaries would be as large as possible,
assurances were obtained during negotiations that: (a) project beneficiaries
would have a pre-project annual income from farming activities not higher than
US$2,500 per family (Section 1.02 of the draft Guarantee Agreement); and



- 15 -
(b) for each sub-project, average investment per family would not exceed
US$10,000 (Section 3.09 of the draft Guarantee Agreement). While beneficiaries'
pre-project incomes are typically as described above, the cut-off point of
US$2,500 is the same that has been applied under the PIDER program. Experience
shows that this limit is rarely reached.
49.       The project is expected to create approximately 8,300 man-years of
permanent agricultural employment. In addition about 11,700 man-years of
employment during construction, much of which would utilize the unskilled
labor of project beneficiaries, would be created.
Economic Evaluation
50.       The economic rate of return of the project is estimated to be 23 per-
cent based on a weighted average of the rates of return of typical sub-projects.
Rates of return for irrigation sub-projects are generally 30 percent for
projects based on pumping from rivers, 24 percent for groundwater projects and
18 percent for storage dam projects. Drainage sub-projects averaged rates of
return of 26 percent anid livestock sub-projects 16 percent. In calculating
rates of return, labor was shadow priced at between 50 and 100 percent of the
official minimum wage to account for regional variations in unemployment.
Risks
51.       OEDR has a proven record as a successful implementing agency for
small-scale irrigation works. The risk of shortfalls in the attainment of
project goals is thus highest in sub-projects for drainage and livestock
development which constitute relatively new components of the program.  How-
ever, the risks are acceptable due to the technical and administrative capacity
of OHDR and the low technical complexity of these types of sub-projects.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Nacional Financ,era,
S.A., the draft Guarantee Agreement between United Mexican States and the
Bank, and the Report oE the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii), of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
53.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
54.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

Notes: Although the data are drawn from sources generally judged the most authoritative and reliable. it should also be noted that they may not be inter-
nationally comparable because of the lad of ztandardized definitions and concepts used by different countries in collecting the data. The data are, nonetheless,
useful to describe orders of magnitude, indicate trends, and characterioe certain major differences between countries.
The adiusted gcoop averages for each indicator are population-weighted geometric means, excluding the entree values of the indicator and the most
populated country in eoch group. Coverage of countries among the indicators depends on availability of dots and is not uniform. Sue to lack of data.,
group averages for Capital Surpluz Oil iEporters and indicators of access to water and excreta disposal, housing, incoe distribution and poverty are
simple population-weighted geometric means without the exclusion of extreme values.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION: PROGRESS AND PROBLEMS 1/
Ln. No. 793    Zihuatanelo Tourism Project:  $22 Million Loan of January 22,
1972; Effectiveness Date: March 30, 1973. Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
All infrastructure works at Ixtapa and in the town of Zihuatanejo
are complete.  The international airport at Zihuatanejo is now
being served by 35 flights a week from Mexico City. A new
bilateral air agreement between Mexico and the US was signed
in January 1978 that will allow Mexican and US air carriers to
serve Zihuatanejo directly from 23 US cities.  A comprehensive
hotel staff training program has been approved by the Bank and
is under implementation.
Ln. No. 909    Mexico City Water Supply Project:  $90 Million Loan of
June 18, 1973; Effectiveness Date: April 30, 1974.
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Project works are well advanced except in the Texcoco Region.
Overall, more than half of the project works as originally
defined have been completed, and the works in progress are
expected to be completed by the end of 1978. The Government
has proposed that savings in carrying out some components of
the projects be applied to finance new works which would serve
the same objective of increasing bulk water supply to the Mexico
City metropolitan area. The Government is carrying out a
revision of the bulk water rate, on confirmation of which
a recommendation on changes in the project description will
be submitted to Executive Directors.
Ln. No. 968    Seventh Highway Project:  $90 Million Loan of March 1, 1974;
Effectiveness Date: May 29, 1974. Closing Date: December 31,
1978.
Substantial delays have been encountered in the initiation of
project works because of the shortage of budgetary allocations.
Substantial cost increases caused by price escalation were also
encountered. Taking this into account, a change in the scope
of the project was made in August 1977, from 16 roads (1,975
km) to ten roads and part of an eleventh road (1,216 km) which,
because of cost increases, have the same total cost as the
original project. The roads remaining in the project continue
to be well justified as benefits have kept pace with costs.
Completion is now expected for late 1980 or about two and a
half years behind schedule.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in that sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 969    Rio Panuco Irrigation Project;  $77 Million Loan of
March 1, L974; Effectiveness Date: May 29, 1974.
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Construction is over 60 percent completed and termination of
all works is scheduled for 1980. About 67,000 ha were
planted in the previous season; on full development the
project will provide irrigation to 137,000 ha. The technical
assistanc,e program and the land settlement program are pro-
ceeding satisfactorily. However, inflation has been greater
than estimated at the time of appraisal, and project costs have
risen to about US$366 million equivalent from the original
estimate of US$208 million. A US$25 million supplemental Bank
loan was approved July 11, 1978 to help finance the increase in
cost of this project.
Ln. No. 970    Rio Sinaloa Irrigation Project:  $47 Million Loan of
March 1, 1974; Effectiveness Date: May 29, 1974.
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Construction of major project works remain substantially
behind the original schedule; the pace is, however,
accelerating as additional budgetary support is being
provided. Project authorities are rephasing project
construction and integrating parts of the project with
the neighboring Rio Fuerte Irrigation District. Project
costs have risen from US$146 million at appraisal to
US$560 million because of higher inflation than projected
at appraisal and delays in project execution. A substan-
tial reduction in project scope may therefore be proposed
with deferred works to be included in a later project.
Ln. No. 1022   Airport Development Project:  $25 Million Loan of
May 28, 1974; Effectiveness Date: September 16, 1974.
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
The project originally included the construction of seven
regional airports and the expansion of an existing one at
Campeche. Of these, the Guaymas airport works have been
postponed by the Government because of interim improvements
of the existing airport carried out by the local municipality
with its own resources. At Campeche, the Government has
decided to construct a new airport with its own funds
instead of improving the existing airport. Loan proceeds
allocated to Guaymas and Campeche were reallocated in August
1977 to complete construction of the six airports retained
in the project. Works in all the six airports are proceeding
satisfacitorily.

Ln. No. 1053   Papaloapan Integrated Rural Development Project:  $50 Million
Loan of November 15, 1974; Effectiveness Date: January 27,
1975. Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Project implementation is accelerating after delays due to
inadequate budget support. Budget levels have been inadequate
but are under review and are likely to be raised in 1979.
A reprogramming of the project is planned during early 1979
to adjust for these delays.
Ln. No. 1110   Integrated Rural Development Project (PIDER I):  $110 Million
Loan of May 8, 1975; Effectiveness Date: October 29, 1975.
Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
Project investments are generally on schedule and management
is taking actions to further strengthen project implementation.
Special inter-agency agreements regarding the development
credit, agricultural extension, and farmer organization compo-
nents are being implemented. The new PIDER management is
giving priority to ensuring the proper operation and mainte-
nance of earlier PIDER investments. Emphasis is also being
given to strengthening the efforts regarding cost recovery,
investment analysis and programming, monitoring, and rural
industries.
Ln. No. 1111   Seventh Irrigation Project - Bajo Rio Bravo and Bajo Rio
San Juan: $150 Million Loan of May 8, 1975; subsequently
reduced to $50 Million; Effectiveness Date: July 30, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
The Government and the Bank have agreed that, in view of
the size and complexity of the project, its high cost and
the Government's current policy of restraining fiscal expendi-
tures, it would be advisable to carry out the project in
several phases over a longer period of time than the seven
years originally visualized. As explained in Memorandum
R77-305 of December 13, 1977, the loan amount has now been
reduced from $150 million to $50 million to be applied
to the first phase of the project which would be implemented
over four years. A recent mission reviewed the Government's
reprogramming of project investments and a memorandum to the
Executive Directors is being prepared to notify them of the
mission's findings.
Ln. No. 1112   Fertilizer Project:  $50 Million Loan of May 22, 1975;
Effectiveness Date: July 30, 1975. Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Serious construction delays were encountered early in 1977
due to a shortage of resources following the peso devalua-
tion, and the problem was aggravated by the dislocation

caused by changes in the companies' management at about the
same time. Progress of the work on the Salamanca projects,
after recommencement of work in June was, however, extremely
slow and culminated in termination of the main construction
contract in March this year. Since the appointment of a new
contractor in May and the strengthening of FERTIMEX construc-
tion management organization, the speed of the work has
improved and completion is now scheduled for June 1979.
Construction of the 1,500 TPD urea plant at Coatzacoalcos is
also behind schedule, but work in this project is now pro-
ceeding satisfactorily and is expected to be completed by
February 1980.
Ln. No. 1186   Medium Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project:  $40 million
Loan of January 13, 1976; Effectiveness Date: April 26, 1976.
Closing Date: December 31,-1980.
Subloan agreements have been signed with three cities where
construction has begun. It is expected that agreements will be
signed by the end of the year with local authorities for four
additional subprojects which would fully commit the loan funds.
Ln. No. 1205   Industrial Equipment Fund (FONEI) Project:  $50 Million Loan of
April 30, 1976; Effectiveness Date: August 30, 1976. Closing
Date: December 31, 1979.
Demand for financing for industrial projects has strengthened
and FONEI has numerous applications on hand. As of
September 30, 1978, 88 percent of the loan was committed to
industrial subprojects.
Ln. No. 1217   Fifth Agricultural and Livestock Credit Project:  $125 Million
Loan of March 11, 1976; Effectiveness Date: August 30, 1976.
Closing Date: January 1, 1980.
The med:Lum-income producers' category is fully disbursed and
priority is being given to accelerating the project component
benefitting low-income farmers.
Ln. No. 1232   Third Riailway Project:  $100 Million Loan of April 30, 1976;
Effectiveness Date:  June 16, 1976.  Closing Date:  June 30, 1979.
Execution of the project has been generally satisfactory.
Orders have been placed for rails, car components, track
and workshop machinery. Following the devaluation in 1976,
and the budgetary cuts in the stabilization period, and the
slackening in the traffic growth, the railway has proposed
substantial rephasing of its investment plan and procurement
schedule, details of which are being worked out. The execution

period of the project will require to be extended by about two
years. Operational and technical improvements of the railway
continue, though they have not yet been reflected in the
financial performance of the railway on account of inadequate
tariff increases. The Government and the Bank are jointly
working out a revised list of goods.
