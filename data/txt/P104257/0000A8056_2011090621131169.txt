                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is: within a fragile context, to promote a coordinated development approach which builds the capacity of communities to
                         plan for and manage development resources. The key indicators for project success include:
                         a)       percentage of activities identified through the Area Development Plans that receive funding from other sources;

                         b)         percentage of projects with economically and/or socially marginalized groups as main beneficiaries.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Development Objective Indicators are being achieved. 59% of sub-projects target at vulnerable groups and the percentage of financing leveraged from other sources to fund
                         infrastructure stands at approximately 57%. (Targets at this stage of project implementation are 50% and 10%). All 109 targeted villages and neighborhoods have prepared their

                         Community Development Plans (CDPs) and have selected sub-projects for financing as part of cycle 1. The CDPs have also been updated for cycle 2. (Note that the project will be
                         fully implemented in two cycles). The achievement of the PDO is therefore rated as moderately satisfactory.
