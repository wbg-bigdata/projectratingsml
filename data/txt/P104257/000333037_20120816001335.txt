                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A.     SUMMARY

1.      The proposed changes are to (i) refine selected Project Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) to enable better measurement of the achievement of the Project
Development Objective (PDO); (ii) extend the closing date from April 30, 2012 to
October 31, 2013, to allow for completion of all project activities, following protracted
delays in project start-up and initial implementation; (iii) reallocate the Trust Fund Grant
Agreement (TFGA) proceeds to ensure adequate financing for project implementation
and oversight activities following the project’s extension. The proposed modifications
constitute a level-2 restructuring.

B.     PROJECT STATUS

2.      PDO: The objective of the project is to promote a coordinated development
approach which builds the capacity of communities to plan for and manage resources.
KPIs are being achieved. 59% of sub-projects are reaching targeted vulnerable groups;
and the percentage of financing leveraged from other sources to fund infrastructure
identified in community development plans (CDPs) is 57%. The targets for the Mi-Term
Review (MTR) (which was concluded in April, 2011) were 50% and 10% respectively.
The progress towards achievement of the PDO is therefore rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.

3.      Implementation Progress: The project is implemented in two Cycles. All 109
targeted villages and neighborhoods have prepared Community Development Plans
(CDP’s) and have selected and are implementing prioritized sub-projects for Cycle 1
(US$3.4 million). Most sub-projects under Cycle 1 have been completed, however, with
substantial delays. Cycle 2 has been launched recently. The CDPs have been updated for
Cycle 2 and sub-projects are currently being prioritized for selection by the targeted
villages and neighborhoods.

4.     Disbursements are at around 43% as of February 29, 2012. Although this
represents a considerable increase from 22% in April, 2011, the disbursement lag is over
53%. Consequently, implementation progress continues to be rated as Moderately
Unsatisfactory. Procurement, and Monitoring and Evaluation are rated as Moderately
Satisfactory. Project Management and Financial Management are rated as Moderately
Unsatisfactory due to inadequate follow up by the Project Management Team (PMT) on
FM issues following a staffing change, and because the PMT has not yet met actions
agreed in the MTR aimed at improving its technical and management capacity for
implementation.

C.     PROPOSED CHANGES

5.    Results/indicators: Changes include (i) refinement of wording to allow for
improved measurement of the key performance and outcome indicators; (ii) dropping of

                                             4
one intermediate outcome indicator (i.e. KPI No. 12 in Annex 1) as it is already listed as
one of the two PDO outcome indicators. Refer to Annex 1.

6.    Reallocation: There is no change in the categories of expenditures. Proceeds for
West Bank and Gaza, GZ-Village and Neighborhood Development Project, TF:092174,
P104257 will be reallocated as follow:

7.       The proposed reallocation is required to supplement category 3, Consultants’
Services, as an anticipated transfer of project management and implementation activities
for the West Bank villages from Consultants to the staff of the Ministry of Local
Government (MoLG) did not fully materialize due to a lack of staff and staff capacity in
that Ministry. More specifically (i) the MoLG do not have staff members who can take
on the role of community mobilizers in the West Bank; (ii) the participating Joint
Services Councils (JSCPDs) in the West Bank have varying degrees of implementation
capacity, and, particularly, engineering capacity to fully carry out their engineering
design, preparation of bidding documents and sub-projects construction supervision role;
(iii) volume of work in the MoLG, coupled with a virtual hiring freeze due to the PA’s
financial situation has meant that MoLG staff assigned to work on the project devote
considerably less time than initially envisaged during project preparation.

8.      Consequently, some consultant’s contracts require extension. The hiring of
additional consultants is also essential for completion of project implementation activities
and, particularly for oversight of Cycle 2 implementation in the West Bank. Key changes
include (i) an extension of the contract for the Oversight Consultant for the West Bank;
and (ii) extension of contracts and hiring of additional staff for the PMT including an FM
Specialist, Procurement Officer, and an Engineer. The PMT has confirmed that funds
remaining under the Incremental Operating Costs category after the reallocation would be
sufficient for Project management. The funds reallocated from this category would
support retaining PMT staff under the Consultants’ services category.

9.     Closing date: The closing date of the project would be extended from April 30,
2012 until October 31, 2013 to compensate for the initial delays in project start up and in
the implementation of Cycle 1. The delays resulted from the inexperience of the Project
PMT in the implementation of Community Driven Development (CDD) projects and
                                             5
from a somewhat ambitious project implementation schedule at project design. The
extension would allow for (i) a completion of all activities planned for Cycle 2 sub-
project implementation and hence for the PDO to be fully achieved; (ii) completion of all
assessment reports including the Beneficiary Impact Assessment, Technical Audits for
sub-project implementation and the final Project evaluations and reporting.

10.    An updated budget has been prepared by the PMT, reviewed by the Bank and
found to be acceptable. An updated Procurement Plan was sent for the Bank’s review and
was cleared on January 11, 2012.

11.    This will be the first extension of the project.

12.    Implementation Schedule: An updated implementation schedule and plan
corresponding with the proposed new Project Closing date have been submitted by the
PMT and reviewed by the Bank and were found acceptable and realistic.
