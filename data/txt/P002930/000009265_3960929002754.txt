MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
FOR A LIVESTOCK SERVICES PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to Uganda
for SDR 16.1 million (US$21 million equivalent) to help finance a Livestock
Services Project is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be
on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years.
2.        Background.  Agriculture contributes about 75Z of Uganda's GDP
and supports about 2.2 million small producers with average land holdings
of 2 ha. Small scale agriculture is characterized by low capital outlays
and unimproved technology. The sector was devastated by two decades of
political instability and economic mismanagement. Through the Economic
Recovery Program, the Government of Uganda (GOU) hAs begun to rebuild this
sector which is potentially a major source of growth. An Agricultural
Sector Action Program has been drawn up with IDA assistance, which
envisages: (a) improved incentives for producers; (b) establishment of
efficient and competitive marketing arrangements for inputs and outputs;
(c) rationalization of crop processing capacity; and (d) dev lopment of
research capacity and agricultural services to support improvements in
small farm productivity and encourage diversification of the sector,
currently dominated by coffee.   This agenda complements GOU efforts to
build rural infrastructure and activate rural enterprises.
3.        Livestock contributes 30% of the agricultural GDP, ard almost
one-third of farming households depend on livertock for a major part of
their income. Production potential is high because quality pasture can be
grown year-round and animals provide milk, meat, manure and draught power.
Cattle, which make up 90? of domestic animal biomass, are highly vulnerable
to disease, with rinderpest, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia,
trypanosomiasis and East Coast Fever causing most mortality. The presence
of tsetse flies and ticks and the high temperature and humidity in many
parts of Uganda contribute to disease risks and threaten Uganda's livestock
prospects. From the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s, disease control programs
were implemented effectively and the evolution of modern dairying,
ranching, pig and poultry production increased livestock sector
productivity.  Since then, the disease control program has broken down due
to lack of vaccines, acaracides and drugs, the deterioration of services
provided by the Ministry of Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAIF), and the
collapse of the transport and marketing systems. Tsetse flies, which had
been exterminated, have re-established in several areas. Since 1985,
nearly a third o.' Uganda's cattle have been lost to disease. Per capita
consumption of meat and milk has fallen by 502 since 1970. Unless
immediate measures are taken, losses will escalate and production of meat
and milk will be jeopardized.
4.        Measures to control diseases and rebuild the national herd need
to be complemented with measures to ensure adequate nutrition year-round,
to improve cattle productivity and to protect the environment. An increase
in area under forage, using Uganda's excellent potential for legume-based
forage production and capitalizing on recent technological developments, is
therefore urgent and timely. Advanced farmers in Uganda have already



-2-
demonstrated the success of this technology and there is need for a program
to replicate it.
5.        KAIF's capacity to service the livestock sector has been badly
eroded. While the number of veterinarians has increased tenfold to around
500 during the last 20 years, they have been absorbed into MAIF which has
been crippled by an unclear mandate, inadequate salaries, and a lack of
operating funds and supporting investments. For several years MAIF has
been implementing a policy of fully recovering the cost of curative
services involving drugs and acaracides. Government policy is that MAIF
should concentrate on disease prevention, encouraging the development of
private veterinary practices for curative services, and the distribution of
drugs through private channels. With assistance under TA II (Cr. 1434-UG),
a functional review of HAIF has been conducted, including a detailed
inventory of current staff resources and their responsibilities. From this
starting point there is now a need to define and implement a reorganization
plan and an associated timebound and monitorable Action Program to reduce
staff numbers and promote cost effective delivery of selected animal health
services within a more limited mandate for the public sector, incldding
development of private veterinary practices, voluntary retirement schemes,
and staff retraining. The preparation of this Action Program is being
financed uider TA III (Cr. 1951-UG).
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Bank's assistance strategy
aims at restoring productive capacity, while steering the economy towards
long-term growth. Rebuilding the livestock sector is an important element
in restoring agricultural produc:ivity. The establishment of efficient
viable livestock services is therefore fully consistent with the country
assistance strategy. IDA has been involved with livestock sector studies
since 1984 and has been taking the lead among donors in the dialogue in
this sector. Joint efforts between IDA and the Government have identified
the problems in the subsector and led to the preparation of the proposed
project. The project complements other IDA projects such as ERC II (Cr.
1844-1-UG), which aims at supporting the macro framework; the Agricultural
Sector Adjustment Credit, which will underpin the sector framework; and
other proposed agricultural services projects. The proposed streamlining
of MAIF's organizational structure and staffing strength builds on efforts
initiated under TA II and supplements civil service reform initiatives
under ERC II aimeu at functional rationalization within selected
ministries, including MAIF.
7.        Objectives and Main Features.  The project has two main
objectives. The first and immediate objective is to reverse the decline in
livestock numbers by dealing with the alarming animal disease situation.
To this end the project would support an emergency national disease control
program and a tsetse fly control program. The disease control program
would be complemented by improved animal nutrition through support for
forage development. The second objective would be to improve the quality
and cost-effectiveness of livestock services provided by MAIF. This would
involve institutional reform, retraining, and launching the privatization
of veterinary practices. The project, to be implemented over five years,
would need to be followed by an operatior. to broaden and consolidate



- 3 -
institutional reforms and provide further assistance to MAIF's animal
health and production services.
8.        Project Description.  The project would provide funds for: (a) a
national animal disease control prcgram, including the establishment of
mobile service units equipped to control disease outbreaks, and the
rehabilitation of HAIF's diagnostic facilities for disease control; (b) a
tsetse fly control program in the Luwero, Mubende, Masindi and Hoima
districts (areas not covered by other donors); (c) forage development
through seed production and services covering about 7,500 milk producing
farms, 12,000 ha of communal and ranch; areas and 10,000 km of grass strips
to protect terraced cultivation in the southwest; (d) credit channeled
through suitable commercial banks and training to assist in the
establishment of about sixty private veterinary practices; (e)
institutional development, including technical assistance, to help execute
a program to streamline HAIF's organizational structure and reduce its
staffing levels; and (f) project management support to MAIF in the areas of
financial management and procurement. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$24.7 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$17.3
million (70Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursemants, and the
disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Uganda are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Three maps are also attached.
The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8486-UG, dated July 30, 1990, is also
attached.
9.        Agreed Actions.  Terms of reference of key consultants have been
agreed. In addition, assurances have been obtained on: (a) an action
program to streamline MAIF's structure and staffing and to introduce an
improved management information system; (b) preparation of acceptable
annual work programs and a joint mid-term review to be carried out prior to
December 1993; (c) measures to secure counterpart funds, and cost recovery
measures; (d) transfer of curative veterinary services to private
veterinarians; (e) financial arrangements to assist in privatizatTon of
veterinary services, including selection criteria of participating )anks,
composition of committee screening loan applications, operation of a credit
guarantee scheme, and level of interest rates; (f) eventual privatization
of packaging and distribution of forage seeds; (g) phasing out Government
ranches and farms not required for extension and research; and (h)
guidelines for procurement of insecticides. Agreement was also obtained
that prior to credit effectiveness: (a) contractual arrangements for the
recruitment of key consultants would be completed; (b) the Project
Management Committee, comprising key project staff, would be established
and its members appointed; and (c) Subsidiary Loan Agreements between GOU
and the participating banks would be executed.
10.       Benefits, Environmental Impact and Risks.  The project would
reverse the spread of significant livestock diseases and avert major
epidemics which would otherwise decimate the national herd and,
complemented by animal nutrition improvements brought about by expanded
areas under forage, would directly increase the production of animal
products, for which there is a ready market. Crop productivity would



-4-
improve through better soil fertility and draught animal power, and the
forage component would assist erosion control through soil and water
conservation. Control or eradication of the tsetse fly would allow re-
establishment of crop or livestock production into areas currently
infested. Milk production as a result of project impact would support
efforts made by other donors to expand milk processing and marketing
facilities. Many small dairy farmers are women. The project -ould benefit
about 500,000 households, of which 802 depend heavily on livestock for
income.
11.       Since technology for disease control is well tested, risks arise
mainly from weak implementation of components. Technical assistance and
training would reduce these risks. Strengthening the capacity of MAIF and
redefining its functions calls for a high level of commitment, which GOU
has displayed. A similar commitment is required towards efrorts outside
the scope of the project for ensuring its, financial sustainability, and
this has been sought under ERC II.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied th.e the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
