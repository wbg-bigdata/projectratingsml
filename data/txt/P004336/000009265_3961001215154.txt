MEMORAUDJM AND RECONNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO RFPUBLIC OF MALDIVES
FOR A THIRD FISHERIES PROJECT
I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed development credit to Republic of Maldives for
SDR 7.6 million (US$10.0 million equivalent) to help finance a Third Fisheries
Project. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity
of 40 years. Part of the proceeds of the development credit, equivalent to
US$2.6 million, will be onlent by the Government of Maldives (GO), to the
Fisheries Projects Impleme.ntation Department (FPID) of the State Trading
Organization (STO) for 20 years, including 5 years of grace with an interest
rate of 13 percent per annum, reflecting prevailing commercial rates. GOM
will bear the foreign exchange risk. The project would be cofinanced by
Norway, Sweden, the Nordic Development Fund, OPEC Fund and UNDP.
T.  COUNTRY POLICIES AND BAR GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEG!
A. Economic Deve_loment and Prospects
1.1       Economic and Social BackMround.   Maldives is an Indian Ocean
archipelago of an estimated 1,200 small coral islands, of which about 200 are
inhabited. Most of the islands are small, few with a land area in excess of
one sq. km., and are low-lying, with an average elevation of 1.6 m above mean
sea level. The total land area of the islands is 298 sq km, only 10 percent
of which is suitable for agriculture. The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of
the Maldives consists of some 900,000 sq km, more than 3000 times the land
area.
1.2       The population of Naldives was 213,215 in 1990, and it has increased
at a rate of 3.4 percent per annum in recent years. Per capita incomes are
estimated at approximately US$600 per annum, ranking it among the poorer of
the small island economies. Despite smallness, remoteness, and the lack of
natural resources, the Maldives has performed exceptionally well in the 1980s
and in many ways has proven to be a model of development management for other
small island economies.
1.3       Since the mid-1970s, the economy has grown in excess of 10 percent
per annum, driven largely by growth in tourism and commercial fisheries, which
taken together account for about one-third of gross domestic product. Other
rural activities, which include subsistence production, account for
approximately 13 percent of GDP. Other important sectors of the economy
include wholesale and retail trade, and manufacturing, the latter dominated by
a nascent garment industry. Manufacturing and construction together account
for 15 percent of GDP sad wholesaling and transport for 22 percent; government
administration represents a modest 8 percent of GDP.



1.4       The strong performance of the economy has been matched by a
reduction in poverty and improvement in key social indicators. GNP per capita
has increased at a rate of 7 percer.t per annum over the past decade, one of
the highest in the developing world. Infant mortality has been slaahed from
121 per thousand in 1977 to 34 in 1990 while the crude death rate fell from
18 percent to 7 percent oveT the same period. Daily per capita calorie intake
and protein stpply have increased substantially, access to potable water
supply and sanitation facilities have doubled, child immunization is now
universal, and some debilitating diseases such as malaria have been
eradicated. Primary school enrollment has increased from 26 percent in 1977
to 90 percent at present, and secondary enrollment from 2 percent to
21 percent over the same period. Women are active in the labor force,
including accounting for 30 percent of the civil service, but have so far
played a limited role in the thriving tourism industry. The one negative
aspect of rapid economic growth has been overcrowding in Male, the capital
island. Around 26 percent of the country's population now live in Male, and
congestion is severe with a population density of 35,000 persons per sq km and
14 persons per dwelling.
1.5       Rapid economic growth has created a situation of effective zero
unemployment in Maldives despite a high rate of population growth. Indeed,
because of a perennial labor shortage, excess demand for labor is met by
expatriate labor, which grew from 4 percent of the labor force in 1985 to over
15 percent in 1990. The majority of the expatriate labor comes from
neighboring countries, although, in tourism, some expatriate labor comes from
Europe. The tightening of the labor market has led to rising wage costs, and
contributed to an inflAtion rate near 10 percent per annum in recent years
(see Schedule E).
1.6       Following the emergence of large domestic and external imbalances in
the early 1980s, the autherities implemented a strong stabilization program
during 1984-88, involving a substantial tightening of monetary and fiscal
policies and a large devaluation of the rufiyaa in 1987. In response to the
adjustment measures and the continuation of a favorable external environment,
the overall fiscal position and the external current account began improving
in 1985, with both shifting into surplus during 1987-88; gross international
reserves rose significantly from a low of some US$5 million in 1985 to
US$22 million by end-1988.
1.7       Having achieved successful stabilization, the authorities initiated
a program of economic liberalization in 1989. Import quotas were lifted at
the beginning of the year; subsequently, exports of dried and salted fish were
opened to the private sector and a revibaed law on direct foreign investment
was approved to encourage inflows of private foreign capital. The private
sector was permitted to play a greater role in import trade, which previously
had been the exclusive domain of the STO.  In August 1989, sectoral limits on
commercial bank lending were abolished, although controls on interest rates,
through ceilings on commercial loan rates, were retained.  Finally, at the
beginning of 1990, import duties on a broad range of items were reduced.
1.8       Recent Economic Developments.  GDP growth reached 15 percent in
1990, propelled by record levels of tourist arrivals and fish catch. Tourist
arrivals rose from 159,000 in 1989 to 195,000 in 1990; total fish catch rose



- 3 -
from 71,000 metric tons in 1989 to 76,000 metric tons in 1990. Key economic
indicators are shown in Table 1.
1.9       The strong external demand from tourism and fish exports was
reinforced by the easing of monetary and fiscal policies. Following two years
of surpluses, the budget recorded a deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP in 1989; the
deficit rose to 14 percent of GDP in 1990. The widening of the deficit was
largely due to an increase in current expenditures, including extraordinary
outlays for the twenty-fifth anniversary of Independence and the South Asian
regional summit, increased outlays for security and a 40 percent increase in
civil servant wages.
1.10      Monetary policy was relaxed in August 1989 in conjunction with the
removal of sectoral credit limits. Domestic credit subsequently expanded
rapidly, largely to finance buoyant import trade and tourist resort
construction. The credit expansion was financed in part by foreign borrowing
of commercial banks. A further acceler.ttion in growth of credit to the
private sector and the large financing need of the public sector sustained the
high growth rate of domestic credit through the third quarter of 1990.

1.11      The resulting expansion of domestic demand led to a sharp surge in
imports and the erosion of the current account surplus despite strong growth
in exports and tourist earnings as well as a further increase in external
grants. This, in turn, resulted in a decline in reserves, with import
coverage of gross reserves falling to 2.5 months compared with a peak level of
3.2 months in 1988.



- 4 -
1.12      Maldives wee buffetted by major external shocks in the first half of
1991. The Gulf War led to a major decline in touriat receipts in the first
half of the year and also adversely affected the petroleum import bill as well
as shipping and remittance receipts. A second shock came from severe storms
which swept the country in May, damaging or destroying dwellings, boat yards,
tree crops and public infrastructure, and reducing the fish catch. These
corts were partly mitigated by prompt assistance from the intetnational
community.
1.13      Growth recovered in the second half of 1991, led by tourism and is
expected to approach S percent for the year as a whole. However, the
combination of strong growth together with the legacy of expansionary monetary
and fiscal policies resulted in an increase in inflationary preesures and
continued weakening of the external position.  The measures announced in
August-September 1990 to tighten uonetary policy were successful in curbing
credit growth to the private sector and reducing the demand for imports.
However, money supply continued to expand at a brisk pace and domestic
borrowing by GOM remained large during the first half of 1991, thereby fueling
domestic demand. Recognizing the need to restore financial stability, GOM has
moved to adopt a move restrictive fiscal and monetary stance, primarily
through curbing fiscal expenditure and substantially reducing the level of
domestic borrowing by GOM.
1.14      Development Strategv.  Haldives faces three key medium- and longer-
term development challenges:
•    continue to raise living standards and provide employment for a
rapidly growing labor force,
•    ensure broad-based participation in the growth process, particularly
of poorer income groups outside Male; and
*    improve access to social services at all levels.
1.15      The Third National Development Plan for 1991-93 (which is currently
under preparation) and the documents prepared for the 1991 Round Table meeting
respond to these challenges. Fisheries and tourism are expected to continue
to be the leading sectors of the economy. Prospects for major diversification
into agricultural or industrial activities remain limited, yet options for
efficient diversification of products and markets, within tourism and
fisheries, remain strong. Diversification coupled with improvements to social
services in the outer atolls would help reduce further population pressures in
Male.
1.16      Although no major shift is foreseen in the basic growth strategy,
there are a number of ways in which the development setting in the 1990s will
be different from the past. First, there is an opportunity and need for the
private sector to play & greater role in the economy. As a result of
development over the past decade, and the stimulus provided by recent
deregulation measures, the private sector is now more vigorous and capable of
assuming an enhanced role in all spheres of economic activity. Increases in
the number, scale and complexity of needed investments in tourism, fisheries
an4 services dictate a high degree of private sector participation.  At the



- 5 -
same time, GOM will be under increasing financial and institutional pressures
to maintain, upgrade and expand infrastructure and social services suggesting
that it should focus its role in these areas and on creating a sound policy
environment.
1.17      Second, population growth and development will put increasing
pressures on the fragile natural resource base, requiring more careful
environmental management. Finally, while external assistance will continue to
play an im-nrtant role in supporting the country's development efforts, the
limited prospects for increase in such assistance and large financing needs
imply a greater need to mobilize domestic resources.
1.18      A Policy Agenda for the 1990s.  Tc -eet its development objectives
in this setting, the Government will need to:
*    preserve macroeconomic stability and competitiveness, and take
further steps to improve domestic resource mobilization;
*    promote the role of the private sector;
*    expand public investment in infrastructure and basic services,
particularly in the outer atolls; and,
*    upgrade and expand education, health and family planning services.
1.19      Sound macroeconomic management is an essential element in a policy
framework to support private sector development. For Maldives, this would
imply that the fiscal deficit should be narrowed substantially in the coming
years, with strong efforts made to ensure a better balance between domestic
revenues and cutlays. On the expenditure side, this will require careful
prioritization of the public investment program and considerable restraint in
current expenditures. In terms of revenues, efforts will be needed to widen
the tax base, increase cost recovery measures and raise user charges for
public goods and services. Monetary policy should operate in closer harmony
with fiscal policy, and should not bear an excessive share of the
stabilization burden. To contain short-run monetary expansion, the
stabilization measures suggested above should be implemented at an early date.
The early removal of interest rate ceilings will also facilitate the needed
expansion ot credit to the private sector. In the medium-term, introduction
of new treasury debt instruments would allow for a more market-oriented
management of liquidity. Concurrently, continued efforts should be made to
retain competitiveness through flexible management of the exchange rate. Over
time, further build-up of foreign exchange reserves is warranted to cushion
the economy from external events.
1.20      Improving public enterprise performance will reduce the financing
burden on the public aector, increase output and provide additional
opportunities for private sector investment. However, as a growing share of
income flows to the private sector, efficient tax instruments will need to be
devised to finance essential Government services. The two traditional sources
of fiscal revenues--import duties and public enterprise dividends--hold
limited prospects for growth as tariff rates are reduced and as public
enterprises play a smaller role. Recognizing limited institutional capacity



- 6 -
to administer tax systems, GOM will need to introduce a phased program of tax
reform.
1.21      The private sector will play a leading role in the economic
development in the 1990s. The policy environment in the Maldives has
generally been favorable to, and successful in, promoting the private sector,
while recent deregulation measures have provided a further stimulus ir this
regard. To build on this past record, and create an even more efficient,
competitive and adaptive private sector, GOM needs to address remaining
shortcomings in the incentive and regulatory framework, develop laws and
institutions to support a market-oriinted economy and pursue policies to
m8ximize the potential in tourism, fisheries and atoll activities.
1.22      The public sector will continue to play a very important role in the
growth pr:zess, but increasingly less so in directly productive activities.
Instead, the focus of public sector activity would need to shift to providing
economic infrastructure and social services, deweloping an enabling policy
framework to promoting private sector development, Ind mobilizing domestic and
external resources needed to finance growth. Institutional develorment is
also needed in the area of environmental preservation. More so than in many
other nations, the careful management of natural resources is vital to the
continued success of the Maldivian economy. With increasingly tight financial
and staffing constraints and high unit costs of building and maintaining
infrastructure in the outer atolls, GOM will need to: (i) set clear priorities
on infrastructure development that takes into account availability of
financing, recurrent expenditure implications and the capacity to implement
and operate the new facilities; (ii) address cost recovery issues at an early
phase of project development; and (iii) consider commercialization and private
participation in the provision of services and construction of infrastructure,
wherever feasible.
1.23      Rapid population growth will necessitate continued expansion of
preventative and primary health care, and primary education programs. Given
rising income levels, the main focus of social service investments in the next
decade will be in upgrading services and expanding the provision of curative
health services, secondary education and vocational training. Careful
prioritization of education expenditures will be required in light of rapidly
rising service demand, limited teacher supply and expenditure constraints.
Rather than expand coverage too rapidly, emphasis should be placed on quality
upgrading, through teacher training and curriculum development, which, in
turn, would require the consolidation of educational service institutions.
1.24      Considerable progress has been registered in reducing conmiun±cable,
tropical diseases, but more remains to be done. The provision of primary
health care services, especially mother and child health programs, need to be
improved in the atolls through increasing the supply of trained health workers
and drugs, improving transport facilities and decentralizing administrative
responsibility to local levels. As the disease profile shifts, demand for
tertiary health care services will rise. With improvements in mortality and
morbidity, and continued high fertility levels, the population prowth rate
increased from 3.1 percent in 1980 to 3.4 percent at the end of the decade.
GOM has recently put much greater emphasis on child spacing programs but,
urgent efforts are required to: (i) increase contraceptive availability and



- 7 -
awareness; (il) allow private sector provision of contraceptives; and (iii)
integrate population topics into mass media and education curriculum.
1.25      Prospeets for Sustained Growth.l/  Following a year of slow growth
in 1991, the short-term outlook for the Mald±ves' economy is dominated by a
tourism-led recovery and retrencbment in goverment expenditures, which taken
together set the stage for a return to the robust growth of earlier years.
After increasing by about 5 percent in 1991, real GDP would rebound by
8 percent in 1992 before slowing a little to 7 percent in 1993. Regarding
fi3val policy, measures on the side of both revenue and spending are expected
to narrow the overall deficit from 14 percent of GDP in 1990 to just over
5 percent by 1993. Over the medium-term, real growth would continue strong,
in the range of 6 - 8 percent per annum, led by rapid--albeit decelerating--
growth in tourism. Growth in the fisheries sector would slow markedly, to
about 5 percent per annum from almost 10 percent in the 1980s. Slowing growth
over the medium-term would be moderated somewhat by government administration
and agriculture; the government sector would pick-up after the current period
of fiscal consolidation while agriculture would recover slowly from
destruction caused by the severe storm of May 30, 1991 while making inroads
into the resort community as a local supplier of fresh fruits.
B. Bank Group Strategy
1.26      Country Assistance Straterv.  The IDA strategy in assisting the
Maldives Government to achieve its development objectives is to:
*    help sustain the strong economic growth generated -ver recent years
in order to raise incomes and achieve a further re-uction in
poverty, particularly in the outer atolls;
a    broaden access to, and improve the quality of, social services;
*    strengthen institutionel capacity; and
*    facilitate private sector developmenL.
This strategy has been, and will continue to be, pursued through a broad based
approach to development assistance in key growth and social service sectors.
*        1.27      Onaoinm Program.  The IDA program in Maldives has been quite
successful. Maldives has received four IDA credits totalling $24 million
since 1979, two of the credits have been closed. IDA assistance has been
focussed on the main income generating sectors underlying the strong growth
performance as well as on human resource development. The general success of
the IDA program reflects the ability of GOM to set clear priorities, the
capability of institutions to undertake and implement development activities,
project design in tune with lo al capabilities and IDA support for key
strategic sectors that help maximize development effectiveness.

1.28      Two fisheries projects have been completed successfully both with
the objectives of increasing fish production and exports as well as providing
a significant boost to the incomes of artisanal fishermen in the Northern and
Southern atolls. The first project was designed to mechanize privately owned
fishing vessels and to develop more efficient artisanal tuna fishing vessels.
Catches per vessel were substantially increased. The second project was
focussed on strengthening shore based infrastructure and the provision of fish
collector vessels to handle increased tonnage of fish as well as improving the
institutional capacity of STO to manage the collection, processing and
marketing of the catch. GON's strategy for the fisheries sector is described
in paragraph 2.3.
1.29      A critical constraint to development in the Maldives has been a
shortage of skilled personnel. The Education and Training project is
supporting the expansion and upgrading of secondary educationl assistance by
other donors is being provided to address the problems in primary education.
The project is broadening access of people on more remote atolls to secondary
education through the establishment of the first regional secondary school in
the country as well as improving tbs planning and managemert capacity in the
Ministry of Education. Informatl.on on the labor market is being improved to
assist in developing education and training programs more attuned to labor
market needs. Approximately 170 study years of overseas scholarships, are
being provided for higher-level training.
1.30      Provision of regional education facilities will provide greater
equality in access to higher level education, help meet the government's
decentralization objective and, in the longer term, help alleviate poverty in
the outerlying atolls.
1.31      Tourism has been a key growth sector in the economy.  However,
growth in tourist numbers and the intrzduction of heavier, wide-bodied
aircraft meant that the lack of adequate infrastructure risked a decline in
the level of activity aud substantially constrained prospects for further
development in the sector. Support is being provided under the Mhale Airport
Upgrading project to assist the government to provide an infrastructure



environment attractive to potential investors in the tourism sector and to
help ensure the attractiveness of Maldives an a tourist destination. The
runtay and associated ground facilities are   'ng upgraded and the capacity to
handle additional passengers enhanced. The financial management capacity of
the Maldives Airport Authority is being further developed under the project.
1.32      Broadening of secondary education services to regiooal areas will
provide increased opportunity for women to gain skills necessary to enter the
skilled segment of the workforce. Participation of women in one of the key
growth areas, tourism, remains low and relatively few women have risen to
senior levels in government. Increased adoption of canning and freezing
technology in the fish processing industry has contributed to a decline in
employment of women in the arduous task of preparing Maldives Fish.  This has
been offset by increased family incomes and alternative employment
opportunities opening up in agricultural activities.
1.33      Recent economic and sector work by IDA on Maldives has included the
preparation of the 1991 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM). This memorandum
develops a policy reform framework and sets out a strategy to assist in the
establishment of an enabling environment conducive to the maintenance of the
momentum in economic growth generated over the last decade. The CEM served as
a background document for the last UNDP Round Table meeting held in October
1991.
1.34      GOM is preparing a report to the 1992 UN Conference on Environment
and Development which is to provide a detailed assessment of environmental
challenges. This report is also expected to form the basis of the Maldive's
Environmental Action Plan to be submitted to IDA.
1.35      Forward Program.  New lending operations in the short-term will
focus on the fisheries sector (proposed Third Fisheries Project) and improving
the qual: '.y and access to social services including education and possibly
health. Consistent with GOM objectives, assistance should be designed to help
ensure that development benefits are spread more broadly across the country
and shared more equitably.
1.36      GOM's development policy in relation to social services stresses the
need to accelerate human resource development, emphasizing skill formation,
and the need to improve access to and quality of health services. The lack of
an adequate supply of skilled personnel is limiting development options and
programs. Scope exists to build on experience gained from the IDA's ongoing
Education and Training project to further expand opportunities and improve
equity of access to secondary schooling for students on atolls remote from
Male; particularly in the northern group by providing regional secondary
school facilities and continuing to offer training fellowships. Although over
90 percent of primary age children attend school, less than 25 percent of
secondary school age children are en-olled in secondary schools.
1.37      Significant improvements have been achieved in strengthening health
services. But much has yet to be done to address the problems of the limited
number of skilled health workers; the relatively high population growth rate,
3.4 percent; high maternal death rates and the devulopment and implementation
of a rural, decentralized, health care program. Scope exists for IDA to



- 10 -
assist in improving the quality of, and access to, health services--
particularly for women in the outer atolls.
1.38      Further analysie of developments in the Maldives' economy will be
provided under the Bank's regional economic reporting program. Maldives will
continue to provide, along with other island countries, a useful comparator
for the second Regional Economic Report on the South Pacific. New sector work
on Maldives will be undertaken, where appropriate, in the context of -he
Pacific regional sector work program.
1.39      Aid Coordination.  IDA's princiral role in aid coordination is to
support the already established UNDP Round Table p-o.cess which reviews the
Maldives' development and investment needs on a biennial basis. The next
Round Table meeting for the Maldives is due in 1993.
1.40      IDA will continue to work with other donors in developing its
program. Both the second and proposed third fisheries projects involve
multiple cofinpncing as does the airport upgrading project.
1.41      Maldives is on a biennial cycle of consultation with the IME, the
last Article IV Consultation took place in January/February 1991. The IMF is
providing technical assistance to the Maldives Monetary Authority to assist in
the development of the central banking system and its statistical base.
1.42      There are currently nu IFC operations in the Maldives, but the
Corporation is pursuing selected private sector projects in the tourism and
transport sectors.
C. Summary
1.43      Over the past decade, Maldives has exhibited very strong economic
growth coupled with improvements in key social sectors of health and
education. To sustain growth momentum will now require a reorientation of GOM
development policy and strategy with greater focus on restoration of financial
stability, encouraging the private sector to play a greater role in the
economy and broadening the domestic resource mobilization effort. Future
growth will continue to depend on further development of the fisheries and
tourism sectors, with added emphasis on private sector involvement and product
diversification. To support this development strategy, a key priority for GOM
will be continued emphasis on human resource development, particularly in
secondary education and basic health care. The proposed fisheries project
will directly assist one of the prime growth sectors in Maldives as vell as
helping address poverty alleviation in the outerlyi.ig islands. Other future
IDA activity could include further activities related to human resource
development with the objectives of upgrading the quality and improving the
availability of social services. Education and health are possible areas of
future lending operations to be examined with GOM.

It. THE PROJECT
2.1       BackAround.  Fishing is the most important primary activity in the
Maldivian economy, accounting for over 58 percent of the value added of the
primary sector. More than 15 percent of GDP and about 33 percent of foreign
exchange earnings (about 80 percent of exports) derive from fisheries. Its
actual share of GDP may be higher because of unreported catches and processqng
activities related to dried fish. Furthermore, fish processing, transpor
and distribution account for a significant proportion of the manufacturing and
trading activities in the country. Fisheries is also the most important
single activity for the Maldivian labor force, as fishing ir Maldives is
artisanal in nature. In 1990, fishing provided direct employment for about
20 percent of the country's labor force. On many islands, notably in the
extreme north and south of the ccuntry, fishing is the main and sometimes the
only economic activity, and maintenance of an economically healthy fishing
sector is one of the crucial conditions for slowing the migration of young
people to the severely congested Male. Of the 1990 total fish landings of
about 76,000 tons, consisting mainly of tuna (92 percent), about 59,000 tons
(77 percent) of fresh fish equivalent was exported in frozen, canned, dried or
traditionally processed form, with the other 23 percent being consumed
domestically. The trad'.tionally processed products include "Maldive Fish",
parboiled, smoked and dried tuna, which was the major fisheries product
exported from Maldives until the early 1970s, mainly to Sri Lanka. Per capita
consumption of fish is about 90 kg/year of fresh fish equivalent, which is
very high by international standards. Tuna landings have grown 15 percent
annually since 1981, largely due to the mechanization of fishing boats and
investments in processing facilities, and growth prospects for the fishery
sector are good. Due to the abundance of resources near fishermen's homes and
low cost artisanal fishing vessels (dhonis), Maldives has the world's lowest
production cost of tuna, while the pole and line fishing method employed is
environmentally (dolphin) friendly.
2.2       Kev Sectoral Issues.  The main constraint to increased fish
production and export remains inadequate collection and processing capacity,
although substantial progress has been made through the assistance provided by
the two earlier IDA-supported projects. Three of the largest mother vessels
currently freezing tuna are so old that they will have to be scrapped soon,
necessitating immediate action to replace these vessels ith more efficient
shore-based facilities. Restructuring of STO/FPID (the main processor/
exporter of fish) and further participation of the private sector in the
processing and marketing of fish would be opportune because the investment
needs of the sector are straining the public sector's borrowing, management,
and absorptive capacities. It is also prudent for GOM to continue to increase
knowledge of tuna stocks in the Maldivian inshore waters because of lack of
precise estimates of tuna stocks in the Maldivian EEZ, and of the importance
of the sustainable exploitation of the resource. Further improvement in fish
pricing/tariff policy and the institutional ability to do so are also required
to ensure production efficiency and equitable distribution of proceeds.
2.3       Govrunmet Strateag.  GOM's objectives for the sector are to:
increase fish production and its contribution to GDP; preserve its marine
resources and the environment; improve export performance of the sector;
maintain employm*nt and raise income and living standards of the traditional



- 12 -
fishermen, who remain the backbone of the sector. The medium- to long-term
strategy envisages focusing the role of the public sector on the provision of
infrastructure and regulatory and support services, while encouraging the
private sector to participate in the processing and marketing of fish. GOM
believes that private sector participation in the collection and processing of
fish should be formulated in the context of a revised regulatory, legal, and
fiscal environment.  GOM has initiated a study of this issue and decided to
restructure STO/FPID by creating a separate company to handle its fisheries
activities.  In the short-term, GOM wishes to replace and augment the aging
and inefficient floating freezer vessels with shore-based freezing facilities.
2.4       Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement.  Overall, the
performance of the Bank's fisheries portfolio has not been good, as concluded
by the 1984 OED review of past experience with fisheries development (OED
Report No. 4184). In contrast to this general pattern, Maldivian projects
have been an exception.  Bank experience with fisheries investments there has
been highly satisfactory (para. 1.28). The important lessons learned from the
First IDA Project (Cr. 907-MAL) are in OED PPAR No. 5587 and include:
(a) project formulation was expeditiously handled by a team containing an
appropriate range of technical expertise; (b) project design was simple,
flexible and relevant to both the needs of the fishing industry and to the
management and institutional capability of the implementing agency; and
(c) the project did not attempt to address the sector's entire investment
requirement, but concentrated on aspects of immediate priority and on
establishing the groundwork for more far-reaching future investments in the
sector. These lessons are similar to those having emerged from the recently
closed Second Fisheries Project (Cr. 1320-MAL). The proposed project's design
takes into account the lessons drawn from the past IDA experience in Maldives
as well as the Bank-wide experience elsewhere.
2.5       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Based on its successful experience
with the previous two operations in the sector, including assistance with aid
coordination, as well as experience with similar projects in other countries,
IDA is well placed to assist GOM in developing this important sector a step
further. In addition to financing specific investments, IDA's assistance to
GOM is needed at this critical juncture to address emerging policy,
institutional and environmental questions. IDA's experience with private
sector participation in development, strengthening of environmental
monitoring, and institutional development would be instrumental to the further
sustainable development of this key sector of the Maldivian economy. Others
associated with the sector have come to appreciate IDA's leadership role
within the donor community in assisting the Maldives fisheries sector and are
looking forward to collaborating with IDA to maximize the potential of the
sector. The proposed project, which would support small-scale fisheries,
conforms to IDA's fisheries sector policy.
2.6       Project Obiectives.  The project will assist GOM to:  increase fish
production, government revenue, and foreign exchange earnings, at a lower
processing costs increase incomes of fishing households to alleviate relative
poverty; reduce migration to the capital, Male, through balanced regional
growth; and create the environment for increased private sector participation
in the fisheries sector. The project is intended to reinforce the existing
system of artisanal fisheries and small-scale fish collection.

2.7       Project Descrigtion.  The project, which would serve the southern
atolls of Gaafu Alifu and Gaafu Dhaalu, would include the following
components: (a) construction of a port at Kooddoo in Gaafu Alifu for dhonis
and collector vessels, including a deep-water berth for direct loading of
frozen fish onto refrigerated (reefer) vessels; (b) construction of a fish
freezing/cold storage complex on the same island, consisting of a brine
freezing and cold storage plant, support facilities such as power and water
desalination plants, workshops, stores, offices and staff housing and the
supply of miscellaneous operational equipment; (c) strengthening the atoll-
wide fish collection system, including the provision of a fleet of seven
collector vessels (three new and four retrofitted) and local training for
collector vessel captains and engineers; and (d) provision of technical
assistance (TA) to: (i) the Project Implementation Unit for technical studies
and preparation of detailed design of some project facilities, procurement and
supervision of the construction work; (ii) STO/FPID for its own restructuring;
(iii) the Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture (MOFA) for strengthening
fisheries research and statistics, further improving the design of existing
fishing vessels, creating a fisheries economics unit to advise GOM on fish
pricing tariff policy and training of MOFA staff; (iv) the Ministry of
Planning and Environment (MPE) for monitoring key environmental parameters
during project implementation; and (v) the Ministry of Trade and Indur.try
(MTI) for preparing and implementing an Action Plan, emanating from the
recommendations of an ongoing GOM study, for encouraging increased private
sector participation in the fisheries sector.
2.8       The proposed project will be implemented by STOIFPID, and the
Borrower's sector agencies over a six-year period. The project cost is
estimated at US$30.5 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$30.0 million (98 percent) and no taxes and duties. A Project Preparation
Facility (PPF) of US$1.5 equivalent, to be reimbursed from the proposed
credit, has been provided to finance eligible expenditures. A breakdown of
project cost and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Maldives are shown in Schedules C and D,
respectively. Basic economic indicators of the country are shown in Schedule
E. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9880-HAL, dated
November 21, 1991, is being distributed separately.
2.9       AgSeed Actions.  During negotiations assurances were obtained from
GOM on, inter Ilia, the following:  (i) review of fish price levels and
establishment of a Presidential Committee to decide on tuna price levels;
(ii) provision to IDA of a detailed staffing plan for the freezing and cold
storage complex at least 12 months before the commencement of operations;
(iii) allocation of a minimum of 15 newly constructed dhonis to the project
area; and (iv) provision of information to IDA on investment for a cannery on
Laamu atoll or a freezing/cold storage facility in the north (Haa Alifu(Haa
Dha,l) before committing to such investments. Conditions of credit
effectiveness will be: (a) the signing of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between
GOI and STO/FPIDs and (b) the effectiveness of the Norwegian, Swedish, Nordic
Development Fund, and OPEC Fund agreements.



- 14 -
2.10      Environment.  Environmental impact has been assessed for the
construction and operational phases of the project. Project design criteria
would ensure that environmental measures would address impacts concerning the
siting, construction, and operation of shore facilities; and management of the
coastal marine resources (including coral reefs). The above issues were
examined in detail during project preparation and appraisal. Facility design
will take coastal erosion into account, and will also take into account the
control of all waste products. Civil engineering works will utilize imported
rock as opposed to mined coral, and steps will be taken to minimize water
pollution from dredged soil. During the operational phase all solid waste
will be incinerated or compacted for disposal. Containment boome and
absorbents will be provided to combat spilla arising accidentally from oil
transfer activities. An environmental baseline survey will be carried out
during detailed design of the project facilities, and the project would assist
NIPE to monitor key environmental parameters during implementation.
2.11      Role of Women.  Women's responsibilities on the islands have mainly
included the processing of Maldive Fish, the gathering of firewood, now in
short supply, and subsistence agriculture. Other traditional income-
generating activities include coir-rope making, thatch and mat weaving,
crafts, midwifery, and traditional medicine. Processing of Maldive Fish done
by fishermen's wives, while contributing to family incomes, is an arduous
nocturnal task and a strain on the health of women. The project would not
change the current production opportunities for Maldive Fish in the project
area and, therefore, would not reduce the employment and income opportunities
of fishermen's wives. The guaranteed fresh fish collection capacity to be
provided by the project would, however, increase beneficiary family incomes by
about 32 percent, from an estimated Rf 6,300 (US$590) presently to about
Rf 8,300 (US$780). These higher incomes would allow women in the project area
the choice of continuing to process Maldive Fish or engaging in other
productive activities, which may not be as remunerative as processing Maldive
Fish, but would improve their quality of life.
2.12      Benefits.  The project would maintain the current tuna catch in the
project area and ultimately increase it by about 26 percent to 16,300 tons
(about 23 percent of 1990 national tuna catch). Tuna exports will be
increased by about 23 percent to 14,000 tons a year (about 25 percent of 1990
total national tuna exports), at full developments representing gross foreign
exchange earnings of about US$12.0 million annually. The project would
provide direct employment to about 240 Ialdivians in processing and support
services, maintain the annual tuna income of about 2,000 relatively poor
fishing households and ultimately increase it by about 32 percent, whereas the
present annual tuna income will decline by 83 percent in the "without project"
scenario. The project will also increase government revenues. The ERR of the
project is estimated at 24 percent.
2.13      Risks.  The risks appear modest.  Fish resources are abundant,
although seasonal shortages could occur due to changes in oceanic temperature
distribution and weather patterns. Export markets are well established and
demand for frozen tuna is expected to grow. Maldivian tuna is well considered
in the world market due to its relatively large size and good quality; and
would continue to be so, especially because it is "dolphin friendly" in an
increasingly environmentally sensitive sector. Involvement of several



- 15 -
cofinanciers in project financing could lead to some delays and coordination
difficulties. However, experience under the first two IDA-supported projects
has demonstrated that such problems can be minimized by proper planning and
advanced consultation during preparation and appraisal, as has been done for
this project. The operation of a new fish processing complex will present a
challenge and will require strong management. Continued incentives to
fishermen to supply adequate throughput could also affect performance of the
fish processing complex. TA and production enhancement strategies within the
project would address these risks.
2.14      Rec;gmendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed development credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
