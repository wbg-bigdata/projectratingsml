MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROP-1SED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR AN EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING FUND
1.           The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Tunisia for US$12.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would provide investment finance for an Employment and Training
Fund prepared by the Government with Bank assistance. The loan would have a term
of 17 years, including five years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
2.           Background. High levels of open unemployment, currently about 16%,
persisted during the last decade, notwithstanding interventionist economic policies
funded by windfall oil revenues, including massive overstaffing of state
enterprises. High natural population growth, combined with stagnant net emigration,
a young age profile and rising female participation, have made it extremely
difficult to match labor supply with job creation. During 1982-1988, GNP grew 4%
p.a., labor productivity by a modest 1.3%, and employment by 2.7%, slightly less
than the labor force. The sweeping economic adjustment process begur in 1986 has
sharpened the authorities' longstanding concern with this issue. The effects of
fiscal austerity and trade and price reforms on ailing state-supported enterprises
imply some further layoffs of workers in the short term, pending the desire-d
upsurge in investment and employment in more diffuse, small-scale private-sector
businesses stimulated by liberalization.
3.           Tunisia's concerted attack on unemployment involves:  (i) a well
defined population policy;  (ii)  a macro-economic progr.n to stabilize  and
restructure the economy; (iii) a reform of the education and pre-employment
training systems to adjust the profile of the labor force to the needs of the
economy; and (iv) a gradual revision of the labor market regulatory framework and
employment promotion policies. While further progress on labor market deregulation
is sought through negotiations between laboir unions and employer federations, the
Government is taking steps to rationalize tne employment promotion framework, and
relax some administrative regulations related to hiring procedures. At the same
time the Government is addressing some of the most urgent problems in labor market
operations, such as the lack of information available to job seekers and employers,
the lack of effective employment intermediation, the limited provision of on-the-
job/off-the-job training activities to facilitate the placement of unemployed
people, and limited labor mobility.
4.           Rationale  for  Bank  Involvement.  Further  progress  in  economic
liberalization and the requirements of an outward-oriented development strategy,
call for greater attention to micro-level issues of employment and productivity.
By focussing on the structure of labor market intermediation, the proposed
operation complements Bank interventions in the areas of: (i) macro-economic
policies, assisted through five adjustment operations including the FY88 Industry
and Trade Policy Adjustment Loan, the FY89 Structural Adjustment Loan and the FY90
Public Enterprise Restructuring Loan, (ii) education and training supported by the
FY89 Education and Training Sector Loan; and (iii) population to be assisted
through a Population and Family Health operation now in the final stages of
preparation. The proposed loan would assist the Government in improving labor
mobility by developing regional-based intermediation mechanisms for employment and



- 2 -
skills training.   The shift of responsibilities toward local governments and
employers to identify employment opportunities and the move toward private labor
market intermediation are promising new directions for reorganizing employment
promotion efforts. The proposed loan is a low cost approach to labor market
intermediation which may provide a useful benchmark for other countries.  The
Bank's preseice in this critical phase of institutional innovation is instrumental
to the successful continuation of economic adjustment.
5.           Proiect Obiectives. The objectives of the proposed project are: (a) to
accelerate the adaptation of the labor force to rapidly changing job patterns,
through more effective training and labor market intermediation; (b) to consolidate
existing human capital by developing in-company training activities.
6.           Project Description. To achieve these objectives the proposed project
would finance the creation of a regionally based Employment and Training Fund and
an institutional development program. Both components would be implemented by the
Ministry of Vocational Training and Employment (MFPE) through the Office of
Vocational Training and Employment (OFPE), an organization under MFPE's
responsibility.
7.           The EmDloyment and Training Fund (ETF), is designed to finance various
types of sub-projects targeting the placement oi. unemployed people into productive
employment and the productivity of existing workers. Typically a sub-project
consists of one of the following activities: (i) training for placement in a
specific enterprise; (ii) training for self-employment; (iii) in-company training/
extension services; (iv) sub-contracting to private training/placement companies;
(v) allowances for interview/relocation closer to job site. Agreed eligibility
criteria emphasize evidence of long-term unemployment by participants (on the basis
of registration at the local employment office), commitment by enterprises to
recruit upon satisfactory completion of training requirements (on the basis of
contracts), and provision of intermediation services by private entities (the
enterprises themselves, private training/placement companies and independent
trainers recruited on a contractual basis).
8.           At the national level, the operations of ETF would be controlled by
the National Management Committee. This Committee would be chaired by the Minister
of Employment and Vocational Training and OFPE would act as its Executive
Secretariat. The Committee woula provide overall guidance with regard to Fund
activities, and monitor and evaluate implementation. In each participating
Governorate, a Regional Coordination Committee, chaired by the Governor, would help
identify and monitor local ETF sub-projects. On a day to day basis, OFPE regional
representatives, assisted by full time Fund managers, would have primary
responsibility for managing ETF. Private enterprises would directly participate in
sub-project preparation, financing and implementation. Sub-project proposals in
participating Governorates which meet the agreed criteria for any standard activity
and fall under a ceiling of TD 100,000 (US$112,000) would be approved by OFPE
regional representatives. In exceptional cases where the amount of a proposed --tb-
project is above the agreed ceiling, a new activity is introduced, or projects in
a new Governorate are proposed, approval by the Bank and the National Management
Committee would be required. Disbursements on this component would cover 50X of
eligible Fund expenditures, documented by statements of expenditures subject to ex-
post verification and audit.



. 3 -
9.           Since January 1990, the Government has already tested the proposed
ETF organizatior and procedures with USAID bridge financing. Altogether 13 sub-
projects, representing about US$500,000 in disbursements have been identified and
implemented in five different Governorates. A total of about 1,000 unemployed
people are being prepared, through a period of 3 to 12 months of on-the-job/off-
the-job training, for specific semi-skilled jobs in industry and services.
Typically, these people, representative of the target group of the proposed
project, constitute the core of unemployment in Tunisia: '-hey are young (between
the age of 18 and 25), have limited education (between five and nine years of
education), and have experienced long periods of unemployment (one year or more)
or insecure/casual employment.
10.          The Institutional DeveloRment Program would assist the Office of
Vocational Training and Employment (OFPE) in its efforts to improve the quality
and efficiency of its employment/training regional services and to promote the
development of private intermediaries. This will have a multiplier effect on
Government's efforts to tackle unemployment. This component would strengthen key
OFPE services to enterprises (selection, placement and in-company training),
develop information and counseling for job-seekers, setting up a labor market
monitoring system, and strengthen project management and evaluation.
11.          Cost and Financing.   The total project cost of US$34.7 million
equivalent would be financed as follows: (a) a proposed IBRD loan of US$12 million
equivalent would finance 34.5% of total project cost; (b) a proposed USAID loan of
US$4.5 million  equivalent  would  finance  13.0%  of  total  p-oject  cost;
(c) enterprises participating in ETF would finance US$8.5 million equivalent
(including US$0.8 million in taxes), or 24.5% of total project cost; and (d) the
Government would finance the remaining US$9.7 million equivalent (including US$1.4
million in taxes), or 28.0% of total project cost. The proposed Bank loan of US$12
million would finance 66% of the foreign exchange component of the project
(US$3.5 million) and 31% of local costs net of taxes (US$8.5 million). A breakdown
of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.  Amounts and
methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Tunisia are given in Schedules C and D respectively. The staff appraisal report
No. 8630-TUN, dated July 13, 1990, is being distributed separately.
12.          Agreed Actions. During negotiations, the Government agreed that: (a)
before loan effectiveness, ETF would be established through a specially earmarked
budgetary allocation, a manual of procedures would be finalized and the National
Management Committee would be established; (b) specific incentive measures,
referred to in para. 3, would be taken with a view to restructuring employment
promotion programs, and loosening hiring procedures; (c) standard activities,
referred to in para. 7, would be eligible for financing by ETF, under specific
conditions described for each type of activity; (d) a cost-benefit analysis of
existing employment promotion programs would be completed by December 31, 1991 and
a mid-term evaluation study of ETF activities would be completed no later than
December 31, 1992; and (e) fees, which would progressively approximate full cost,
would be charged for the services provided in the area of in-company training and
staff selection.
13.          Benefits.  The proposed project would make a valuable contribution
towards providing employment and income generation for a specifically vulnerable
part of the population (young, poorly educated, low-income, long-term unemployed).



The major quantifiable benefit would be the placement of an estimated 30,000 people
into productive employment over an initial three year period which could be
extended and replicated later. While the objective of the proposed project is not
to 'create jobs' but to adapt the profile of the labor force to existing and
evolving openings, it is clear that the ability of domestic and foreign enterprises
to mobilize and reallocate skilled workers more rapidly will in itself be a
stimulus to more investments and thus additional jobs. This is particullarly true
in a period when sub-contracting for European industries seems to be developing
very fast. The indirect effects of introducing pro-active employment strategies and
improving the efficiency of training systems, in particular within enterprises,
will also increase labor mobility and employers' hiring response to market
conditions.
14.          The restructuring of existing employment promotion programs as well
as the testing of new programs will result in more effective resource allocation
in an area which is claiming an increasing share of Government resources. The
institutional development component, targeting key employment and training
services, will improve the quality and speed of "fit" of job entrants and lower
transactional costs.  The indirect and spinoff benefits, in terms of enhancing
local area initiative capacity, spurring micro-enterprise development and promotion
of private intermediaries, could be substantial.
15.          Environmental Impact.   The project was reviewed under the Bank's
Environmental Assessment procedures a I determined to be in Category C, for
projects which do not result in a significant environmental impact.
16.          Risks.  The major risk lies in the capacity cf regional Government
services to design sub-projects, identify suitable private intermediaries and
manage ETF operations. The first batch of sub-projects implemented satisfactorily
with USAID financing since January 1990 has demonstrated the capacity of regional
OFPE services to plan and implement ETF activities consistent with proposed
guidelines and procedures. During appraisal, particular atf:ention was paid to
decentralizing administration and ensuring that additional tsources - both human
and material - be provided to the various implementing '.;  s at the central and
regional levels.  The other risk relates to possible futut   rganizational changes
within MFPE and its specialized agency, OFPE. This point -ds discussed at length
during negotiations and the Tunisian delegation provided 'tequate assurances that
project implementation would not be adverseLy affected by any such internal
reorganization.
17.          Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
