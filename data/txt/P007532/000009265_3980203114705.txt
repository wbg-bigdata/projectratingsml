PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO - REGIONAL AIRPORTS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1022-ME)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The PCR finds that the project largely met the objectives
envisaged at the time of appraisal (para 9.01). It did so,
however, with substantial time and cost overruns (+93%). These
were partly due to budget limitations (para 3.08), but also
changes to the scope of the project due to much higher traffic in
petroleum producing areas (para 3.09), where two of the largest
airports were located.   Project completion was delayed from 1978
until 1982 but some airports were already operating in 1979 or. a
regular basis.
2.        In addition to larger facilities at the two airports
above, Villahermosa and Minatitlan, the scope of the project was
changed so that one airport was deleted as the local municipality
had extended the present airport (Guaymas) and one airport
(Campeche) was deleted when the Government went beyond the scope
of the limited Bank project. In both cases, traffic had not
developed sufficiently to justify their retention in the Bank
project.
3.        The institution building components of the project had
limited impact (para 6.03), but development in this area did take
place. Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) is now
in charge of a more rational structure of institutions in the
subsector (paras 6.01 and 6.02) more or less meeting the Bank
objectives.
4.        Partly as a result of higher than expected traffic
increase at certain airports but mostly due to the same
inflationary factors that increased construction costs, benefits
4                were much higher than expected leading to an economic rate of
return of 17%. T!e project thus well achieved its economic
objectives (paras 7.04 - 7.07).
5.        Financial performance of the main project beneficiary,
Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA), was good, reflecting a
period of substantial growth (para 5.02). The Government,
however, has not increased tariffs sufficiently to meet some of
the financial covenants (para 5.03). The key introduction of
passenger departure fees was carried out early under the project
but tariff levels were not increased continuously to keep pace
with inflation.

T.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      Mexico covers an area of nearly 2 mill.lon km2. Much of
the country is sparsely populated because of its difficult
topographv and inadequate rainfall, and, althouagh extensive
schemes for agricultural development have iLncreased the areas
under irrigation, the population is urbanizing rapidly - a matter
of concern to the Government. Close to 60% of the population of
54 Inillion in 1973 was urban; this proportion was 52% in 1960 and
43% in 1950. In 1972, about 18% of Mexico's population lived in
the district centered by Mexico City. Although overall
population growth was 3.5% per annum between 1960-1970 - one of
th-e highest rates in the world - urban population growth was
higher than 5% per annum, while rural. growth was only about 1.5%
per annum.
1.02      The Government's aviation policy is based on the
premaise that air transportation plays an important role in
national development and population diffusion. Domestic aviation
has been one of the fastest growing transportation modes. The
Government is attempting to use aviation as of one of several
means to encourage a more even urban development.  It is felt
that, by creating a dependable air transportation system at a
reasonable cost to the users, the population in widely dispersed
communities of the nation will be drawn closer together and be
assisted in their development, as well as being encouraged to
remain in their communities rather than migrate to Mexico City.
1.03      A National Airport Plan (NAP) was developed in 1964 by
a Government-wide committee which provided for a total of 75
airports in Mexico. By 1973, nine of these airports, catering to
long range aircraft, had already been improved, while two more
were tunder construction; 22 others were for medium range aircraft
and the rest for short range.  Except for those already improved
(about 20), the existing facilities were substandard for the
types of aircraft then being added to tbe air carrier fleets.
The NAP envisaged improving all of these facilities to meet "he
present and future demands.
1.04       In 1972, the Bank was asked to consider financing the
construction of 15 regional airports in the medium range group.
Desk analysis prior to appraisal determined that only nine of
these would meet Bank economic justification criteria. During
the appraisal in October 1973, two more complete airports were
dropped but the minor improvement of one of these, Campeche, was
included in the proposed project. The project consisting of
seven complete and one improved airports was approved by the
Board in June 1974.
1.05      The Borrower was NAFINSA (Nacional Financiera S.A.) and
the executing agencies were SOP (Secretaria Obras Publicas, later
changed to SAHOP, Secretaria Asentamientos Humanos y Obras
Publicas), and SCT (Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes).
The Beneficiary was ASA (Aeropuertos Servicios y Auxiliares), the
operator of the airports.



II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Origin of the Project
2.01      The airports to be replaced by the project generally
had lightly paved, short runways obstructed by man-made or
natural obstacles which prevented physical expansion or
threatened the safety of flight. Originally intended for
relatively light single and multi-engine piston powered aircraft,
the airports were totally unsuited for the modern heavier,
faster, more efficient, turbo jet air transports coming into
service. The NAP was developed to establish a priority list for
airports which should be improved. Cursory plans were developed
by SOP for fifteen of the airports and the Bank was asked
unofficially (during a June 1972 supervision mission of Loan
793-ME) to comment on these plans   SOP dropped this list to
twelve, and then following preliminary discussions with the Bank,
to nine for its official request to the Bank.
B. Preparation, Appraisal and Negotiation
2.02      The preparation of the project was carried out by Bank
staff in close collaboration with SOP, SCT, ASA, SHCP, Presidency
and NAFINSA. From the beginning, one of the major objectives of
the Bank was to assure the establishment of a more positive
cooperation between the various Governmental organizations having
aeronautical responsibilities. General coordination by
transportation of SOP, SCT and Presidencia was begun as part of
the Second Railway Loan 825-ME and a Transportation Coordination
Committee was established in 1973. During negotiations, it was
agreed that this Committee would be continued and strengthened.
2.03      The Bank staff had recommended that the Executing
Agency for the airports project be ASA, since ASA would be the
beneficiary in the first instance, and that SOP act as ASA's
agent in designing and constructing the project. This
arrangement was declared unworkable during negotiations and SOP
and SCT were made joint Executing Agencies with the much greater
responsibility placed on SOP, who actually provided all of the
engineering required for the design of the project.
2.04      During appraisal, two of the nine airport projects
presented by the Government failed to meet minimum economic
returns for a feasible Bank project. Upon review during
negotiations, one of these was determined capable of earning a
satisfactory return if only minor improvements were made at the
existing site (Campeche) and the construction of the proposed
replacement airport were delayed for at least five years. Thus,
the project finally accepted consisted of the construction of
seven airports and the exp4'nsion of one other. Two of the
airports were planned to have cross wind runways at some future
date when such runways became justified but originally only
single runways would be constructed at each airport.



2.05      While the Government insisted that ASA maintain its
original status as simply the airport operator, it was agreed
that with its own funds, ASA would reorganize its accounting
system and establish a modern commercial cost accounting system.
In addition, to place ASA on a firm financial footing, it was
agreed that international and domestic passenger departure fees
would be established.
C. Project Description
a.  Physical
Construction of seven new airports at Villahermosa,
Tuxtla Gutierrez, Minatitlan, Poza Rica, Los Mochis, Tapachula
and Guaymas were the main part of the project.
All these airports were to have asphaltic concrete
runways, of 45 meters width and a length between 1,800 and 2,500
meters depending upon elevation and estimated use, lead-in
taxiways, aircraft aprons, terminal buildings, control towers,
fire stations, fuel storage and hydrant systems, electronic and
visual aids, communication systems, automobile parking areas,
fencing, and internal and external access roads of about 5 km
each, except for the airport at Minatitlan, which will be about
33 km long.
Expansion of the existing airport at Campeche, was also
incladed as follows: lengthening the runway by about 30 meters
and strengthening it, enlarging the existing terminal building,
providing new runway lighting, obstruction removal and
navigational aids.
To replace existing installations destroyed to clear
project sites, the Project also included the construction of an
elementary school at Minatitlan, the relocation of part of a gas
pipeline at Villahermosa and the relocation of about 15 km of a
high-tension powerline at Campeche.
b. Engineering
*                        Design, construction contract management and
supervision of construction by Airports Department of SOP of all
contracts, except for those relating to electronic navigational
aids and communications.
Procurement and installation of all electronic
navigational aids and communications by Civil Aviation Department
of SCT.
c. Administrative
Design and implementation of a new cost accounting
system for ASA covering all its airport operations and its
headquarters.
Maintain in operation the Government's Transportation
Coordinating Committee (para 5.09).

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Effectiveness and Start-Up
3.01      There were no special conditions of effectiveness.  The
Loan Agreement was signed June 28, 1974, and the loan became
effective September 16, 1974. The Closing Date was established
as June 30, 1978.
B. Revisions
3.02      The first of three major revisions in the project
occured because of land ownership problems at the Los Mochis
airport site in November 1975 one month after the award of the
earthmoving contract. SOP apparently did not have clear title to
the airport land prior to starting construction, despite Section
3.07 of the Guarantee Agreement which specifically made this
mandatory. After about 1,000 m of the flight strip had been
cleared, a group of Ejidos claimed the land underlying the first
700 m. The Bank notified the Borrower that disbursements to
cover work on the disputed land could not be made until the
problem had been resolved. SOP relocated the entire airport 800
m along the runway centerline to avoid the disputed land.
Additional land purchases were completed in December 1976 and the
Bank advieed the Borrower that disbursements at Los Mochis could
now proceed.
3.03      The second revision was more serious.  Despite the
agreement by the Government to limit construction at Campeche to
an expansion of the existing airport, a supervision mission in
February 1977 discovered that a contract for a completely new
airport at the site earlier reviewed by the appraisal mission had
been awarded in September 1976. After considerable discussion
within the Bank and with the Government, it was decided to delete
Campeche from the project description. In addition, since the
city of Guaymas had expanded its existing airport with its own
funds, the Government had delayed construction of the new airport
from July 1976 to late in 1977.   Finally, the Government's
request to delete Guaymas completely was combined with the
deletion of Campeche and the project description was changed in
August 1977.  The funds for both projects remained in the loan
for use at other project airports.
3.04       The final revision concerned the construction of a
cross wind runway for light aircraft at Tuxtla Gutierrez. This
runway had been shown on the master plan of the airport, but
during the preparation of the project, it had been agreed that
construction would be delayed until such a runway was justified;
a point in time not expected in the near future. However, a
supervision mission in January 1980 discovered that PA contract to
construct this second runway had been awarded in October 1979
one month after the previous supervision mission. At that time,
the construction was being funded by the contractoir because SOP
did not have money for that purpose in its budget. After
discussions with SOP, documentation was finally provlded which



- 5 -
allowed the Bank to accept the second runway as justified.
Hlowever, fundirng for the runway was determined to be solely the
responsibility of the Government and Rank financing was not
affected.
C. Implementation
3.05      During preparation of the project, it was decided that
SOP would separate the various types of work they were
responsible for into four packages for each airport: (a) airport
buildings; (b) aircraft movement areas and access roads; (c)
visual aids and electrical supply and distribution and (d) fuel
storage and distribution. (SCT was to procure its necessary
equipment directly from designated suppliers.)
3.06      International advertising was carried out and a list of
prequalified contractors was prepared showing for which contract
type and location the contractor wished to be considered. For
the 40 possible SOP contracts over 130 contractors registered.
Of these, less than 10 were international firms. Although
international firms were invited to propose, none did and all
contracts were awarded to local firms.
3.07      The original schedule agreed at negotiations called for
the eight (b) type contracts to be awarded at about three week
intervals with the other three contracts (which would take less
time to complete) to follow so as to allow the completioris of all
to coincide. However, from the very beginning, delays were
encountered.  The first award was to be nade in November 1974.
This was delayed until February 1975. All eight of the type (b)
contracts should have been awarded by the end of April 1975. The
last two were indefinetely delayed and finally deleted from the
project (para 3.03). As time went on, the delays became
progressively worse.
3.08      The reason for the delays undoubtedly was the SOP
airport budget.  For instance, in December 1975 the request for
Mex $428.5 million was reduced to Mex $200 million by the
Government. Since other airport work in addition to the Bank
project was in progress, SOP made reallocations of the available
funds and the Bank project work program was stretched out.  This
financial problem continued through to the end of the project and
was intensified when political considerations caused SOP to take
on work not programmed originally during that time period, such
as the sudden decision to enlarge Puerto Vallarta terminal or to
build a completely new airport at Campeche rather than the modest
expansion envisaged by the project.
3.09      An additional factor affected this problem.  Traffic at
Villahermosa and Minatitlan increased at a much greater rate than
expected. As a result, the terminal buildings at both airports
were about doub)?d in size which further delayed the project, as
well as increasing their construction costs.



- 6 --
3.10      The final factor affecting the project delays was the
value of the contracts.  Since they all had escalation clauses,
adjustmerits for inflation kept raising the costs which further
diluted the avaiLable budgeted funds.  To avoid fully disbursing
the loan premnturoly because of rising costs, thie disbursement
rate was dropped from tho orIlginal 42% of total costs to 27%.
Whle thlis extendloc thbe availability of loan ftunds it also added
Lo tho 4elays.
3.11      As the various airports neared completion, SCT procured
the required electronic air navigational aids and communication
equipment.  These were Installed by SCT and SENEAM (Servicios de
la Navegacion y del Espaclo Aereo Mexicano) technicians.
During the appraisal, this organization was then called RAMSA -
Radio Aeronautica Moxicana, S.A. - and was partially owned by
the airlines. It was nationalized in 1978 and now reports to
SCT.
3.1Z      With the exception of Guaymas and Caxapeche, all the
proposed airports were conpleted and are now receiving regular
scheduled service by the type of modern aircraft for which the
project was conceived. Poza Rica was completed and dedicated by
the President March 18, 1.978 and service by AeroNexico started
March 29, 1979. Villahermosa was finished in April 1979 and
service by both AeroMexico and Mexicana started May 5. The
runway at Tuxtla Gutierrez was put in commercial operation when
AeroMexico and Mexicana began operations August 25, 1980.
However, in October 1976, 1800 m of the runway had been provided
with a seal-coat of asphalt so that an insect control program
(cattle screw worms) could operate its aircraft on an interim
basis from the new airport. Tapachula was completed
and AeroMexico began operations in December 1962.   The runway
had been used by agricultural aircraft as early as two years
before. L.os Mochis was completed in December 1982. A regional
airline, AeroCalifornia, began operations with DC-9 aircraft in
October 1982.   Minatitlan was finished in December 1982.
Mexicana transferred its operations to the new airport in October
1982.   The 35 km access road from Minatitlan and Coatzacoalcos
besides providing acces3 to the airport is being heavily
travelled by local. residents, as well as farm and manufacturitng
vehicles (both for supplies and employees).  In addition to being
used by the large commercial transport aircraft, each airport now
has a population of smaller (general aviation) aircraft based at
the airport
3.13      The constructior of all of the facilities funded by the
loan was of good quality. Any minor problems which developed
were rectified.
D.  Reporting
3.14      SOP provided a quarterly construction cost report
through out the project but despite repeated efforts by the Bank,
ASA never provided any reports voluntarily. Attempts were made
by various supervision missions to have the Borrower, NAFINSA,
compile a composite report of SOP and ASA without success. In
fact, during the latter part of the project, ASA was reluctant
to provide any information.



-7-
E. Procurement
3.15      There were no problems with the procurement handled by
SOP. Bank guidelines were followed throughout.
3.16      SCT was authorized to negotiate directly with certain
equipment suppliers rather than advertise. SCT did this but
combined project purchases with non-project purchases in such a
way that determining amounts to be reimbursed was very
difficult. Repeated requests ti SCT and NAFINSA to clarify the
records were unsuccessful and fii.ally NAFINSA stated that no more
applications for reimbursement from Category II, Equipment, would
be made and requested that all remaining funds in that Category
be transferred to Category I, Civil Works. The Bank complied.
F. Performance by Contractors
3.17      Twenty-four major and six minor contracts were issued
by SOP. The civil works contractor at Los Mochis ran into
financial trouble because of the delay of work and eventually was
replaced by SOP.  Except for this, all of the work was of
acceptable quality and the contractors performed well. The work
done by and for SCT was also acceptable and no problems were
encountered.
G. Performance of Consultants
3.18      SOP and SCT did not engage consultants for the
project. They performed all engineering design and construction
supervision with their own forces. This work was acceptable.
(SOP did subcontract some of the architectural design work with
local architects but the control of the project remained with
SOP.)
H. Project Costs
3.19      The original bid prices of the earthwork contracts
exceeded the appraisal estimates by an average of about 12%. The
contract prices for the first four building contracts all awarded
in 1976 exceeded estimates by an average of about 8% but the last
two contracts awarded the latter part of 1978 exceeded the
estimates by about 44%.  The fuel system contracts rose from 65%
above estimates for contracts awarded in early 1977 to 500% over
estimates for the last contract awarded in December 1978 for an
average of about 225% over estimates for the six contracts.  The
visual aids contracts followed a similar pattern. The contract
awarded in mid-1977 was 39% over estimates, while that awarded in
December 1978 was 184% over estimates. The six contracts
averaged 104% over the original estimates.
3.20      The very high costs of the fuel systems could be
explained by the boom in fuel pipeline work in Mexico during that
period. The 100% rise in the visual aids costs reflect the very
high foreign component of this type of material and the
devaluation of the Mexican peso from 12.5 to about 22.5 per U.S.
dollar. Table 3.1 compares the appraisal estimates with the
actual final costs of each contract. Table 3.2 shows the project
cost per airport.

I. Disbursements and Financial Sources
3.21      The reduction of the Government budget allocation to
SOP plus an increase in the scope of this project in addition to
others not contemplated at the time of appraisal Further
aggravated by an unrealistic implementation schedule established
by SOP for the project, combined to make disbursements run
substantially behind the appraisal forecast. Table 3.3 compares
the appraisal and actual schedule of disbursements. Full
disbursement had been expected by June 30, 1978, but only 44% of
the loan had actually been disbursed at that time. In total,
disbursements ran four years behind the appraisal schedule, with
final disbursements made in mid-1982.
3.22       All funds not provided by the loan were provided by the
Government in the annual SOP investment budget.

IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
4.01      Air traffic in Mexico hasi grown very rapidly 4. the
last few years. The best indicatcr is passenger-movewaents which
have developed as follows for the whole of Mexico:
Arriving and Departing Passengers (millions)
Domestic    International
1976                                      10.8            4.0
1977                                      13.8            4.2
1978                                      14.8            5.3
1979                                      19.3            6.5
1980                                     22.6            7.1
1981                                      24.8            7.4
4.02      For the project airports traffic compare' to forecast
is indicated in Table 4.1.  Two of the project air orts are in
areas of rapid petroleum development which clearly influenced
traffic growth. In the others, traffic is slightly below the SAR
forecast. Delays in completing the new airport is the dominant
factor affecting the airport which shows the least growth (Los
Mochis). For the year 1982 despite the fact that the airport was
not quite finished, traffic has increased dramatically and for
1983 traffic is now expected to be close to the original
forecast.
4.03      The results compared to the SAR forecasts of aircraft
movements show more uneven growth. Shifts to heavier aircraft,
as well as from air-taxi services to scheduled flights, have been
very difficult to predict with accuracy. The overall number of
flights, nevertheless, is not as important as the number of
scheduled flights and passengers for the operations and financial
situation of the airports.
4.04      Two airports were deleted from the Bank-financed
project (see para 3.03) Guaymas and Campeche. Traffic at both
has developed less than anticipated. As an example, Guaymas in
1981 had only 49,494 passengers, compared to a forecast for 1981
of 79,100 and Campeche in 1981 4,003 passengers, compared to a
forecast for 1981 of 13,800. For the six project airports in
1981, total arriving and departing passengers were 1,254,000,
compared to a forecasted 950,000 or 32% higher than expected.
This was primarily the result of higher traffic at Villahermosa
and Minatitlan indicated above.
4.05      As anticipated, jet aircraft now operate to the six
project airports. Due partly to higher traffic growth, a shift
to larger aircraft has taken place more rapidly than
anticipated. Both main airlines, AeroMexico and Mexicana now
operate 155-seat aircraft for Minatitlan, Tuxtla-Gutierrez and



- 10 -
Villahermosa with 85-seat aircraft to the other airports. This
change to more cost-effective aircraft has meant a substantial
decrease in real terms in air fares. The average single air
ticket to the three largest airports above changed from US$33.2
in 1976 to US$33.5 in early 1982. At the same time, as a close
comparison, consumer prices in the United States increased some
66%, and operating cost per hour for 2-engine jet aircraft in
Ut.S. domestic trunk service grew from US$835 in 1976 to US$1,718
ir 1981. These cost changes in view of the proximity of the
United States broadly represent US$ cost changes in this period.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER AND THE BENEFICIARY
5.01      Although virtually all of the loan was provided to
SAHOP through Nacional Financiera S.A. (NAFINSA) on behalf of the
Government, the main beneficiary is ASA (see para 1.05). Most of
the financial provisions in the Guarantee Agreement with the
Mexican Government, therefore, relate to ASA and its financial
performance has been the most important. The Loan Agreement with
NAFINSA essenOially only integrates the loan with the SAHOP
budgets for conrstruction.  SCT, apart from its responsibility for
ASA, has had no direct influence on the financial performance.
Indirectly, however, SCT has been a limiting factor constraining
tariff increases for ASA and SENEAM (see para 6.02).
A. Financial Performance
5.02      The financial perfornance of ASA reflects a period of
substantial growth.  Not only has traffic over five-year period
1976-1981 more than doubled, but the integration of fuel services
(para 6.02) has made a major impact on already rapidly expanded
yearly revenues and costs. The development in the 1976-1981
period is shown in Tables 5.1-5.2. Despite these favorable
developments, the overall financial performance of the borrower
for certain years has fallen short of meeting some of the
financial covenants. The main reason for this is inadequate
tariff increases in relation to inflationary increases in
operating costs. Recently, this has been recognized and a
substantial increase, particularly in passenger departure fees,
has taken place in 1982 after ASA became responsible for the
collection of these changes late in 1980. Still even with these
changes, working and operating ratios have been higher than
expected, particularly for the project airports (Table 5.3) where
for 1980 a figure of 150 for the operating ratio was the target
and 155 was achieved, despite higher traffic. In 1981 this
improved to 117. Return on net fixed assets has, for most of the
years, been higher than the 6% target for the operations as a
whole (Table 5.4):
Return of Net
Fixed Assets       Operating Ratlo
See Table 5.4       See Table 5.1
1975                       6.7                  107
1976                        .1                  129
1977                       2.0                  134
1978                       8.0                  114
1979                      12.0                  100
1980                      13.3                  100
1981                       7.3                  103
Mostly, however, the return on Net Fixed Assets has been achieved
through interest income or the passenger departure fee. Without
these the operating ratio indicates a negative return on assets.
Furthermore, assets have not been continuously revalued since
1976.



- 12 -
5.03      In sumtnary, not all of the financial targets have
been met, alshough the most important ones have for most of the
time, if fue- revenues are included.  Fuel supply services are
not nornally a part of air-ort operations. A cost accounting
system was established, reNaluation of assets did take place,
independent auditors were retained and a Government return (see
Table 5.4) of 6% was achieved in 5 years of 7. The project
airports, however, had an operating ratio slightly exceeding 150
irn 1980 and ASA without passenger departure fees did not earn a
4% return (para 5.07 below). The most serious shortcoming,
however, is that governtment counterpart funds to the executing
agency (SAHOP) have not been adequate and, in fact, delayed
implementation by some three years, d,spite the deletion of two
airports, Campeche and Guaymas, from the project.
B. Compliance with Loan Conditions
Conditions Not Complied with in Guarantee Agreement
5.04      Article Ill, Section 3.01(d).  The funds required for
the project were not provided in quantities large enough to meet
the agreed project schedule (para 3.08).
5.05      Article III, Section 3.05(a).  In two instances major
changes to the project were not presented to the Bank for review
prior to the initiation of construction(paras 3.03 and 3.04).
5.06      Article IV, Section 4.06(ii) and (iii) - ASA did not
provide the Bank with its annual audit and financial statement as
required, and in fact, refused to provide this information on two
Enissions.
5.07      Article IV, Section 4.09(a)(ii) - ASA was not able to
meet the 4% rate of return on its operations when the passenger
departure fee is not included in its revenues (tables 5.1-5.2).
5.00      Article IV, Section 4.09(a)(iii)  - ASA has been able
to meet the 6% rate of return on its airports operations
(e:xcluding fuel supply services) even with the passenger
departure fee included in its total revenues only once (1979).
rhis, in combination with Para 5.07, indicates that airport user
charges for other than passengers, i.e., airlines, are not high
enough (para 5.02). Net revenues from fuel supply services has
cornpensated for this shortfall since 1978.
Conditions Met in Guarantee Agreement
5.09      Article III, Section 3.06 - The Government is
maintaining its Transportation Coordinating Committee and SAHOP
did engage consultants to formulate an airport development plan
for the country.  T:!is plan has been followed in all new airport
development.
5.10      Article III, Section 3.07 - SAHOP did purchase all land
required for development of the project prior to construction on
that land with one exception. In that case, a claim arose after
work had started. Frota that moment until all claims had been
resolved, no further work was done at that airport (Los Mochis)
(para 3.02).



- 13 -
5.11      Article III, Section 3.08 - SCT has continued to
maintain an adequate air traffic control and aeronautical
communication system throughout the country first through RAMSA
and now through SENEAM.
5.12      Article IV, Section 4.08 - ASA did identify all its
assets and entered the new valuations in its accounts effective
December 1976, however, no further revaluation has been carried
out since that time (para 6.03).



- 14 -
VI. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
6.01      The Mexican Government has several entities concerned
with civil aviation. At the level of central government, the
main departments are Secretaria de Obras Publicas y Asentamientos
Humanos (SAHOP), previously called SOP, responsible for civil
works construction and maintenance, including airports, and
Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT), responsible for
operatin& the transport system.    At the time of appraisal,
SAHOP was building and maintaining most major airports with an
agency under SCT called Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA),
operating these airports and other agencies providing services
like air traffic control and fuel supply. Air traffic control
and communications was then provided by a semi-private company
called Radio Aeronautica Mexicana S.A. (RAMSA) and fuel at small
airports provided by Distribuidora de Gasolina S.A. (DIGAS) and
at larger airports by Nacional de Combustibles de Aviacion
(NACOA). RAMSA, despite being a separate company, was also under
the responsibility of SCT.
6.02      In late 1978, the Government bought the private
shareholding in RAMSA and established a new Governmental agency
to handle its functions. This new agency is called Servicios de
Navegacion y del Espacio Aereo Mexicano (SENEAM). In 1978-1980
this was followed by an integration of fuel services provided by
NACOA and DIGAS into ASA. Finally, in 1981 the responsibility
for maintaining runways, taxiways and other airport civil works
was transferred from SAHOP to ASA. At the same time,
responsibility for collecting airport passenger fees became the
task of ASA although the proceeds still goes to the Central
Government (Hacienda).
6.03      It is obvious that a project only affecting 4% of the
air passengers in Mexico can have only limited impact on the
institutions involved. Nevertheless, particularly in the early
stages of the project, some institutional improvements did take
place. An ASA cost accounting system was established, an
identification and revaluation of assets was made, maintenance
cost and responsibilities formerly under SOP have been
transferred to ASA and coordination between the agencies has
improved, though still short of what is desirable.

VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
A. General
7.01      As indicated in para 4.01, air transport has been a
rapidly growing mode of transport in Mexico. Its potential was
recognized by the government in a National Airport Plan developed
in 1964. The Bank-financed project can be best described as the
second group of a-rports in this development effort. At the time
of appraisal nine new airports were completed and two were under
construction. Mexico is a country of widely dispersed
communities and some rapidly growing urban centers, primarily
Mexico City. To help integrate the country and promote a more
even urban development, the Government has attempted to create a
dependable air transportation system at a reasonable cost to
users. The two major Mexican airlines were encouraged to buy
more efficient aircraft but substantial infrastructure
improvements were needed at the same time. The economic
evaluation focused on the effects of such improvements on the
eight airports that were part of the Bank project individually,
since most were part of a hub and spoke system with Mexico City
as the hub.
7.02      The evaluation focused on the transport cost savings to
the operators directly affected, i.e., primarily the main
airlines. As was shown in para 4.05, these savings were largely
passed on to the travelers. Other benefits were savings due to
the better use of land for abandoned previous airports sites and
time savings to passengers. This reevaluation mainly reestimates
the actual aircraft cost savings based on present traffic with
anticipated growth. In two cases, benefits from better land use
and passenger time savings were considered important enough to be
included in the new estimate. In the other cases, the residual
land values had not been received either because the land had
been ceded for community use or because the old airport continued
operating for small private aircraft.
7.03      The eight project airports in 1981 served almost 1.3
million passengers of which, Campeche and Guaymas, the two
airports deleted from the Bank project only accounted for
53,000. This gives an indication that their exclusion from the
project was a correct decision from an economic point of view in
both cases (see 3.03).
7.04      A complicating factor for the economic analysis is the
high inflation rate under this period and that the peso has been
undervalued at certain times. Construction costs with 1975
as base ( = 100) in 1981 was 407 whereas consumer prices had only
increased to 335 and the exchange rate changed only from 12.5
pesos/$ to 27.5 pesos/$ from 1975 to 19$1). To convert
construction costs and benefits to the same yearly base can,
therefore, yield different results depending on the methodology
used. Converting all peso amounts to US$ using current exchange
rates, thus ignoring any correction for real cost increases,
leads to an overvaluation of construction costs in US$. This



- 16 -
overvaluation compensates for much of the effect of real (US$)
construction cost increases. The rate of return using this
method is 17% for the six airports with individual rates varying
from 12% to 21%. (See Table 7.1).
7.05      Ignoring exchange rate influences, another method
converts construction cost by an index for these costs to the
price level of 1981, to be compared with benefit calculations in
the prices (in pesos) of that year. This preferred method gives,
again, a return of 17% for the six airports with individual rates
varying from 12% to 22% for the different airports.
7.06      For both methods, the price level for costs and
benefits has been 1981 assuming an 18-20 year life of the
investment and a continued growth of traffic of ?OX, compared to
an average annual growth rate for all domestic air traffic in
Nexico of 18% the last five years and about 16% for the six
project airports.
7.07      The returns estimated above indicate that the project
despite delays and cost overruns is economically viable. The
main reason why rates are lower than the 22-29% indicated in the
SAR is primarily that real cost increases did take place to a
larger extent than anticipated, especially for the most expensive
airports. Thus, the total cost in current US$ wenr from about
US$59 million to US$115 million despite deletion of two airports.



- 17 -
VIII. ROLE OF THE BANK
8.01      The Bank colitributed throughout project preparation and
execution by reviewing and commenting on project selection and
primarily its engineering aspects. During implementation, the
project composition was changed so that one of the airports
(Campeche) was dropped when the Government wanted to construct a
complete new airport.  On the basis of traffic development since,
both the original appraisal decision to stay at lower level of
development of this site and this Bank action were clearly
justified. The Bank also showed flexibility to change the scope
of the project as warranted by developments unforeseen during
project preparation. As a result of very successful petroleum
development traffic in Villahermosa and Minatitlan, terminal
buildings there needed a very substantial increase in size which
the Bank approved. The Bank also agreed to a deletion of the new
airport at Guaymas to allow these buildings, as well as other
higher priority work to be carried out.
8.02      The Bank's role in institution-building has been more
limited. Some of the financial covenants have not been
consistently met but by and large the institutions in the sector
are now better coordinated than before and a more realistic
distribution of tasks have taken place, with ASA now, for
example, responsible for all airport maintenance.
8.03      At the time of the Completion Report Mission, there was
serious considerations within ASA, SAHOP and SCT, that the entire
responsibility for airport design, construction and operation
would be transfered to ASA under the new administration. If
this, in fact, happens, then most of the coordination and
administration problems forseen by the Bank's Executive Directors
during Board Presentation that have not already been taken care
of will be rectified.

IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      The Regional Airports Project has been successful
despite cost and time overruns. The primary objective of
providing a number of local population centers with much improved
airport Infrastructure has been met thereby providing significant
direct savings to users and assistance in integrating thie
country.
9.02      Unfortunately, the financial capability of the Mexican
Government was overestimated and some of the priorities had to Se
modified. Generally, however, changes made were well justified
and the project well executed despite cost increases mainly due
to inflation.

Actual disbursements have been slower than estimated at time of appraisal
for two reasons. First, counterpart funds from the Government were not
furnished as quickly as estimated because of a general shortage of funds
within the Government; and second, processing of disbursement requests
through the Government and the Borrower take approximately one year.
All efforts to have this done more quickly have failed.
