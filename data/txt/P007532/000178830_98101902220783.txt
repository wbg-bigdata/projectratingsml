REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED IOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.A.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR AN AIRPORTS DEVEIDPMENT PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Nacional Financiera, S.A,, with the guarantee of the United Mexican States,
for the equivalent of US$25 million to help finance a project for airports
development. The loan would have a term of 24 years, including four years
of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       "The Economy of Mexico: A Basic Report" (192-ME) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on June 2S, 1973. It was designed to provide both a
long-term perspective on the Mexican economy and a framework for the assess-
ment of short run trends. An economic mission visited Mexico in March 1974
and its report is now being prepared for distribution to the Executive Directors;
the mission's preliminary conclusions are reflected in the discussion which
follows. Annex I contains country data sheets.
3.       For the three most recent of the six decades since the Revolution
of 1910, the success of the Mexican economic system, measured in terms of
GDP growth, has been outstanding. Since 1940, the annual average growth rate
has exceeded 6 percent. And from the mid-1950s to 1972 Mexico was among the
few countries in the developing world to combine a sustained high rate of
growth with monetary and balance of payments stability. The average annual
rate of inflation was less than 5 percent and the dollar value of the peso
was maintained at the level fixed in 1954.
4.       Rapid and sustained growth was the product of successful policies
affecting the mobilization and use of both private and public sector resources.
The role of Government in promoting economic growth was concerned on one hand
with the development of strategic infrastructure and major utility industries
and on the other with policies which featured, in the agricultural sector, the
development of price support, import control and agrarian reform measures,
and in the industrial sector external protection and the provision of fiscal
incentives.
5.       The sectoral allocation of public and private investment was reflected
in a changing structure of output and employment. This featured the growth of
manufacturing industry and the relative decline of agriculture; the latter,
however, continued to be the chief source of employment and accounted in 1970
for 41 percent of the economically active population.
6.       However, given rapid population growth at an annual rate of 3.4
percent over the last decade, economic expansion has not generated suffi-
cient employment opportunities to absorb the labor force which has recently
been growing at about 3.0 percent per year.   In 1973 it was estimated



- 2 -
that about 40 percent of the labor force was engaged in either aargLnal
<<cupations - relatively unproductive and hence poorly paid - or was totally
Euemployed. Partly as a consequence of rapid population growth but also as
a result of the pattern of distribution of incomes and assets in the Mexican
econ=Vy, the strategy which succeeded in promoting rapid growth was not
;-onparably successful in spreading its benefits.  The incidence of poverty
nas now been imch reduced fram earlier levels. But the differentials between
-rich and poor, both between people and places, have probably increased over
s;'ue.
There was, until recently, little evidence (apart from the continua-
tion of the land reform program begun in earnest during the Cardenas regLme
in the 1930s) that Government policies were much ooncerned with these problems.
tr 1970, however, it was apparent that a revised economic strategy - one which
would focus on the improvement of the living conditions of the poor - was
required. It seemed to be understood that this goal should not be pursued at
the expense of rapid growth or of the monetary and balance of payments stability
which appeared to be sine qMa non of sustained economic expansion. The last
three years have demonstrated the Government's determination to develop such a
strategy. The events and trends of this period have also revealed same of the
constraints to doing so.
8.       Among the progressive measures introduced since 1970 are a revision
of the Agrarian Reform Law (1971) which )lad the purpose of democratizing and
increasing the efficiency of the eiido2l system; a new Federal Water Law (1972),
the outstanding feature of which is to izpose minimum and   aximi farm sise
limitations (of 10 and 20 has.) in new irrigation and drainage districts
in an effort to achieve a better distribution of the benefits of public
irrigation programs and to avoid excessive fragmentation; and changes in the
allocation of bank credit which are aimed at increasing the flon of resources
to low income farzers and ejidatarios. These measures are all responsive to
the needs of the rural sector and demonstrate the Government's coneern to
confront them. Another initiative in this category was the introduction
(1972) of a 5 percent payroU tax to finance a new housing progrm for
workers in the lower-middle income groups. It is clear, however, in the
light of the experience of the last three years, that neither the needs
of the poor nor those of the public sector industries (on which the growth
of the econowu as a whole partly depends) can be met without the mobilisation
of additional public sector resources.
9.       In 1971, after the econoqy had begun to show signs of stress in 1970,
the Government took restraining action in order to preserve monetary and
balance of payments stability and the GDP grawth rate fell from the 1960-70
decade average of 7.1 percent to only 3.7 percent, while prices increased by
4.8 percent. In 1972 reneved econamic expansion was stimulated by public sector
j1/ The ejido is a form of collective land tenure based on usufruct rather
than ownership.



- 3 -
expenditures and the GDP growth rate rose to 7.5 percent while prices
increased (in terms of the GDP deflator) by slightly more than 5 percent.
In 1973 a further substantial increase in public expenditures was largely
financed by recourse to increased internal and external borrowing. Private
savings mobilized through the financial intermediaries, which in the past
provided non-inflationary internal financing for budget deficits, fell below
the levels of previous years. Consequently, in 1973 the government's internal
borrowing had a significant effect upon money supply, which increased by 24
percent during the year. This expansion coincided with and was partly
responsible for an acceleration in the rate of domestic price increases. These,
however, also reflected changes in international prices, the impact of which
was especially serious because of a poor harvest in 1972 and the resulting need
to import basic foodstuffs. Consumer prices increased by 22 percent and
wholesale prices by 25 percent during 1973, while the deficit on the current
account of the balance of payments increased by 63 percent over 1972.
10.      In the light of these trends the Government and the monetary
authorities began to take action to stabilize the economy in the middle of
last year. First, monetary policy was tightened from June 1973 onwards.
Second, in an effort to mobilize additional domestic resources electricity
rates were increased by an average of almost 30 percent in October 1973 and
hydrocarbons prices were increased by an average of almost 100 percent in
December 1973.  In aggregate, these measures are expected to yield the
equivalent of almost 2 percent of 1974 GDP for public sector revenues.
Third, the increase in real expenditures in the 1974 budget (approved in
December) was very modest, while the planned use of resources emphasized
the more intensive use of existing fixed investment on one hand and new
investment in productive sectors on tha other. Consistent with a restrictive
monetary program and with restraint in foreign borrowing, the projected
nominal fiscal deficit for 1974 is lower than the final fiscal deficit for
1973, Fourth, interest rates on private savings were increased in March 1974.
11.      These measures are expected to have a stabilizing effect on the economy
in 1974. While the rate of price increases is expected to be higher than
in other recent years, inflation should be substantially lower than in 1973.
Some of the inflationary pressures this year will be derived from a general
increase in wages at the end of 1973 which was negotiated against the back-
ground of deteriorating real incomes of lower paid workers. Furthermore, the
exact amount of inflation in 1974 will depend, in part, on whether an addi-
tional wage adjustment is forthcoming during the year. With respect to the
balance of payments,the stabilization program should have a moderating
influence on the current account deficit which is expected to decline from 3.1
percent of GDP in 1973 to 2.8 percent of GDP in 1974. The deficit will,
however, be higher than it would have otherwise been because of the need to
import hydrocarbons at high international prices.
12.      This impact notwithstanding, Mexico will be relatively less affected
by the world energy crisis than many developing countries. Some 95 percent of
the country's energy requirements are satisfied by hydrocarbons, the balance being
supplied from hydro resources; about 10 percent of total hydrocarbons
requirements have been imported in recent years; the hydrocarbons import bill for
1973 was US$283 million. In 1974 the value of hydrocarbons imports is estimated at



- 4 -
.-S$i418 million. This figure would have been noh higher but for the developsent
t,+' new fields in Chiapas and Tabasco which were formerly expected to amc on-
- treaa in 1975 but are now expected to do so this year. The impact of the
£.nergy crisis on the balance of payments iul  thus be attenuated by the
ortunate discovery of these unusually productive fields.
The rate of economic growth in 1974 will be considerably lower than
ne level of between 7.2 and 7.6 percent which is estimated for 1973, the
present estimate being 4.5 percent. It is anticipated, therefore, that 1974
wilU be a year of fiscal and financial retrenctuent and modest econsaic growth.
14.      While the events of 1573 illustrated the dangers inherent in large
scale deficit financing, they aLso demonstrated the Government's willingness
to take corrective action. Thi3s, together with the record of the Mexican
authorities in econanic management over the last two decades, suggests that
there is reason to accept the Government's assurance that it will continue
to take such measures as are necessary to restore relative price and balance
of payments stability. The Bank and also the Fund are in a continuing dialogue
with the Government regarding these issues.
15.      As of December 31, 1972, Mexico's outstanding disbursed external
public debt was US$4.0 billion, of which the IERD share was US$723 million.
For 1973, net public medium and long-term external borrowing is estimated at
about US$1,:SO million. This represents a sharp increase over the 1972 level
(US$451 million), and reflects the larger public sector deficit in 1973, a
greater reliance upon external rather than domestic borrowing to finance the
deficit, and some borrowing undertaken to offset short-tern capital movementso
The substantial revenue measures recently taken will reduce the public sector's
needs to borrow in 1974. Compared with 1972 and other earlier years, however,
public sector borrowing will be high simply because of world inflation,
Including the higher prices of hydrocarbons imports.
16.      Annex I, Page 4 shows that 41.3 percent of public external capital
contracted in the period 1968-72 was obtained from private banks. This was
the largest single source. International organizations accounted for the
next largest share (22.2 percent) and the World Bank for 14.7 percent of total
commitments. Annex I, Page 4 also shows the sectoral allocation of public
external capital and reveals that power, transport and manufacturing were the
dominant sectors. The terms of recent public external borrowing have continued
to improve in the light of (a) the availability of capital in international
markets and (b) Mexico's reputation as a creditworthy borrower.
17.      During 1974, it is expected that the level of net external borrowing
by the public sector (or guaranteed by the public sector) will be in the order
of US$1,100 million.  Net borrowing of this nagniiude is consistent 'ith
Mexico's debt service capacity. As a result particularly of longer maturities
an borrowing from financial institutions, Mexico's external public debt service
ratio has declined ever the last several years and was 17.3 percent in 1973.



- 5 -
Assuming that the average terns in the future would be about the same as those
which have been recently obtaineds the debt service ratio is expected to remain
below 25 percent dwring the remainder of the 1970s. The Bank's share in public
debt outstanding and disbarsed at the end of 1973 was in the order of 14 percent
while its share in the corresponding debt service was about 10 percent. These
ratios are not expected to change significantly during the remainder of the 1970s.
18.      Mexico thus remains creditworthy for borrowing on conventional terms
provided that the Government continues to follow prudent monetary and fiscal
policies. Its recent actions in the field of public sector prices and the
announcement of an austere fiscal program for 1974 suggests that it intends
to do so.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MEXICO
19.      The Bank has made 36 loans to Mexico, for a total of US$1,813 million
net of cancellations. At the end of March 31, 1974 the Bank held US$1.5 billion
including US$0.7 billion not yet disbursed. Most of these loans have been made
for power, roads aad agriculture. Execution of Bank-financed projects has, on
the whole, been satisfactory. However, disbursements on the US$125 million loan
for the Fourth Power Sector Program were delayed because the Government found it
impossible to effect necessary power tariff changes on schedule. The problem was
resolved when tariffs were increased in October 1973. The National Railways have
not succeeded in achieving the operating ratio targets established under the
Second Railway Project (Ln. 824-ME of May 1972), partly because the required
tariff increases have not been introduced, and partly because of unexpected
labor and fuel cost increases. The railways have now put up to the Government
proposals for a completely revised tariff structure, including tariff increases.
The Government has informed us that these proposals are under active consideration.
20.      IFC has made eleven investment commitments in Mexico amounting to
US$53.1 million, of which as of March 31, 1974., US$35.4 million had been sold,
terminated or cancelled. The US$17.7 million held by the Corporation consist of
US$15.9 million in loans and US$1.8 million in equity. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank loans and IFC commitments as of March 31, 1974, and
notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
21.      Bank lending to Mexico in FY73 consisted of two loans, for agriculture
and water supply, totaling US$200 million. Lending in FY74 has been active, with
four loans aounting to US$281 approved to date; the project under consideration
today will be the last to be submitted for your approval in this fiscal year.
The program in FY74 has also been diversified: loans which have already been
approved include the Las Truchas Steel Project, the Seventh Highway Project and
the Panuco and Sinaloa Irrigation Projects.
22.      In lending to Mexico, the Bank tries to assist the Government in
achieving four major and interrelated objectives. (he objective is to spread
the benefits of growth more widely than before and, more particularly, to
begin to address the problem of rural poverty. A second objective :.s to help
Mexico continue to achieve the remarkable growth of output of the past two
decades, both by investing in projects that directly or indirectly make large
contributions to production and employment, and by supporting changes that
will make existing institutions functi,n more effectively or by creating new
ones that will perform presently neglected functions. A third objective is



- 6 -
4;.o contribute with funds and expertise to the solution of critical adjust-
ment problems that are themselves a result of Mexico's continued growth;
n.rteworthy among these are the problems attendant on a rapid urban expansion,
nd the emerging need to exploit scarce water resources more efficiently.
k fourth objective is to transfer sufficient external resources to complement
fr-xicols quite appreciable domestic savings and provide the necessary funds
lor sufficient economic and social investments in a framework of sound
--<mestic finances and a viable balance of payments.
While the last objective primarily influences the magnitude of
the Bank's program in Mexico, the other three jointly determine its
structure.  Naturally, many operations serve more than one of the ends listed
and may, moreover, support more specific Government objectives. Thus the
recently approved Sinaloa and Panuco Irrigation Projects were designed not
only to help expand production but also to support the Government's policies
on income redistribution as expressed in the Land Reform and Water Laws,
both of 1971. Concern with the vital issue of better water management also
induced the Government, the Bank and UNDP to organize, jointly, a national
water study; the Bank serves as Executing Agency for the UNDP, The Study has
the principal objectives of fonaulating alternative water development
programs for the short, medium and long-term and of adopting key policy
decisions concerning water development and management. It is expected to
use the results of the Study - as they become available - for the identifica-
tion and analysis of future irrigaticin projects.
2L,       Loans in the transport and power sectors are designed explicitly
both to transfer resources to Mexico and to help improve institutional
structures and policies in sectors that play a vital role in industrial and
agricultural production and in the generation and utilization of public
sector resources. At the same time, the Government, together with the Bank,
is attempting to prepare integrated rural development projects in regions in
which income levels are low but where some productive potential can be
identified. One such project, which should be ready for your consideration
in the coming months, will be located in the very poor Papaloapan basin in the
States of Oaxaca, Veracruz and Puebla; another will probably span a wider
area in different regions of the country.
PART III - TRANSPORT IN MEXICO-!
25.       The rugged topography of Mexico, as well as the wide dispersion of
its population, have made transportation a particularly crucial element in
the development of the economy and the integration of the country. Ihiring
the period 1965-72, transport infrastructure has absorbed 23 percent of
public investment expenditures3/ and, as the location, composition and
destination of commodity production shifts over time, further large investment
needs in the sector will have to be met if development is to proceed smoothly,
j/  For details, see "The Economy of Mexico: A Basic Report" (192-ME, June 27,
1973), Volume III.
21 Of these, over one-half was for roads and one-quarter for railways,



- 7 -
26.       Railroads were the main transportation element during Mexico's
first big push toward becoming a modern economy in the late nineteenth
century.  By 1916 the network had grown to 19,000 kmi i.e., it had almost
reached its present extension of about 25,000 knm During the decade of
civil wars following the revolution of 1910, the system however deteriorated
badly. Much of the subsequent investments were devoted merely to making up
the losses of that period.
27.       The process of nationalization of the railways was completed in
1965, and by the late sixties the system, which had been composed of eleven
separate companies, had been consolidated into five government railways.
The most important of these, the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico (N de M),
an autonomous pubLic enterprise, is presently engaged, with the help of a
Bank loan, in a long-term program of modernization and rehabilitation with
a view to reducing costs, rationalizing services and improving overall
performance.
28.       The major problems of the railway subsector are financial and refer
primarily to the fact that tariffs have been held constant since 1958j, while
costs have steadily increased and not been compensated by increasing revenues
or by economies in operations. To help solve their financial problems, the
railways have requested rate increases which are now under consideration by
the Government (See paragraph 19 above).
29.       The long border with the United States has meant that much of the
country's foreign trade is shipped overland. Thus sea trade in recent decades
has been of secondary importance for foreign commerce, but Mexico's ports
do play a significant role in domestic trade which provides 55 percent
of all port activity. Mexico has 36 deep water ports; five of these - Veracruz,
Tampico, Guaymas, Mazatlan and Manzanillo - handle 80 percent of the total
traffic. At present there is under way a long term program of expansion and
modernization of these five ports, for which a Bank loan was made in 1972.
30,       In recent decades roads have becon.e the prime transport mode. The
network of paved roads has grown from about 1,000 km in 1929 to over 70,000
in 1972. More than the railroads, the highways have led to a balanced expansion
of foreign and domestic trade, and to opening up previously inaccessible areas
of Mexico. The principal emphasis in the last few decades has been on the
completion of the primary highway network - some 27,000 km - so as to provide
road connections between Mexico City, state capitals, main production centers,
border crossings and sea ports. While the primary network is a responsibility
of the Federal Government, the secondary network, which has grown from h,200
kms in 1940 to 29,000 kms in 1969, is the joint responsibility of the Federal
and State Governments. The present Administration has greatly expanded the
construction of feeder roads and has launched a program of constructing them
by highly labor-intensive methods, so as to alleviate the pervasive rural
underemployment, During 1973 the program - together with some other rural public
works - gave eaployment to 250,000-300,000 people and is expected to employ

W,OOO during the next few years, if fiscal resources are available.
Air Transport is one of the fastest growing modes of passenger
.uffic in Mexico.  Details on the aviation subsector are given in
---tcraphs 36-43.
The Bank has been associated with the development of the transport
iretor in Mexico for the past twenty years; it has financed seven highway
:-_-oects with loans totalling US$267 milllon, two railway projects with loans
-talling US$136 million, and one port project for US$20 million. Through its
.-rensport projects, the Bank has provided the much needed financing for ex-
3nding and improving the transport system and has assisted in the planning
and execution of investments in the sector. The Barnk has also stimulated
the introduction of a number of institutional improvements in the sector.
Transport Policy and Coordination
5.33      The framework of sectoral policy-making is complex. It includes on
the one hand three secretariats with responsibility for different aspects of
c-olicy making and, on the other, a number of public enterprises resDonsible
for the operation of modal services. The Secretariat of Communications and
Transport (SCT) is in charge of operation of the system by controlling
licenses and tariffs; the Secretariat of Public Works (SOP) is responsible
for road, railroad and airport construction and maintenance, and for program-
rrng investments in these subsectors; the Secretariats of the Presidency
(Presidencia) and of the Navy are responsible for port development. Presidencia
approves all investments in the transport sector. The most important public
enterprises engaged in provision of transport facilities are the National
Hailways, the Airports and Auxiliary Services (ASA), the Air Traffic Control
Services (RAMSA) and the Toll Roads and Bridges Authority.
34.       The three main secretariats dealing with the foinulation of transport
policies and investment programs - SOP, SCT and Presidencia - have recognized
the need for improved transport coordination. A high level inter-agency
commission - the Transport Coordinating Comaittee - responsible for coordinating
policies and investments in the transport sector, was consequently created
under the Presidencia in late 1973. Also, the Government agreed under the
loan for the Second Railway Project to strengthen the planning department of
zST so that it can assist in coordinating long-range transport policy as well
as comment on projects in the transport sector.
35OD,     All investments for roads, railwayE and airports are directly
carried out by SOP, which has just updated a six-year (1971-76) investment
program. The revised program for 1973-77, totalling about US$2.9 billion, allocates
51 percent for Federal and State roads, 35 percent for feeder roads and related
r-aral development investments, 7 percent for railway construction, and 7
percent for airports. This allocation of investmlents anong modes seems
gernerally conEistent with the identifiable needs of the economy0



-9-
The Aviation Subsector
36.      The dispersion of Mexico's population in widely separated ccmmuniti(s
on the one hand and its growing concentration in three urban centers - Mexico
City, Guadalajara and Monterrey - on the other, underscore the need for
efficient communications. Social pressures in the three main cities and the
need for deconcentration as much as the desire to promote balanced regional
development have led the Government to think increasingly in terms of
alternative growth poles. Given the imperativas of such development and of
Mexico's rugged topography, the building up of a strong domestic air net.work
thus assumes primary importance.
37.      The topography of Mexico has already been a key factor in promoting
the rapid growth of domestic aviation. The number of domestic passenger-ion
on the two principal Mexican airlines - Aeromexico (100 percent Government
ownership) and Mexicana de Aviacion (10 percent Government ownership) - went
up from one billion to 4.5 billion between 1962 and 1972. Rapid increase in
passenger traffic is forecast for the future, based on population and income
growth and on additional increases resulting from service improvements.   Thr:
two major airlines are now in the process of upgrading their fleets. Freight
transportation is not yet of major importance (about 40,000 tons per year),
although it has increased in significance in recent years. Several areas: of
the country however offer a good :'reight potential, especially the north-
west vegetable producing region, the southeast shrimp and fish produc½g n   reas
and the heavy industrial areas of the east coast.   Mexico has at pr iscnt 75
airports, 17 of which cater to international traffic; Mexico City is by fr-
the most important, and is the hub of the air network.   In addition to the
two principal carriers, there are eight small feeder airlinr-r operating in
specific regions of the country.
Aviation Sector Organization and Planning
38.      Theoretically, the admiristration and operation of aviation in
Mexico is the responsibility of SCT, but, in practice, it falls under four
organizations which, in the past, had little coordination.   The Direccion
General de Aeronautica Civil (DGAC), within SCT, is in charge of establishing
air routes and procedures, licensing, negotiating bilateral air agreements
and other policy-type matters; it also provides air traffic control serviceS
at some of the smaller airports. The design and supervision of corstrucltion
of airports and other buildings are the responsibility of the Direccion
General de Aeropuertos (DGA) of SOP. After construction, the maintenance
of the airfield operational surfaces (such as runways, taxiways, aprons and
drainage systems) is the responsibility of SOP. The responsibility for the
operation and maintenance of the terminal buildings, maintenance of the field
lighting and collection of landing and rental charges at the 36 main -Jrlports
is that of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxili-res (ASA) (see paragraphs 52-5s).
Most of the remaining airports are operated by municipalities.



- 1O -
39.       Radio Aeronautica Mexicana, S.A. (RAMSA) is responsible for the
operation and maintenance of navigational aids, communication gear, and
is in control of en route air traffic and most terminal traffic. RAMSA
reports to SCT, but is a private corporation which is partially owned by
the Government and the airlines serving Mexico,
40.       Fragmentation of authority for aeronautical affairs has created
difficult problems, such as overinvestment and/or overdesign of facilities,
lack of planning coordination and split responsibility for issues dealing
with aeron%utcal safety. Earlier suggestions by the Bank for the establish-
ment of one governmental agency to handle all of aviation were not accepted
by the Government since, in its view, SCT already has this responsibility.
However, it has now been recogaized that more comprehensive coordination is
desirable, and one of the subcommittees of the Transport Coordinating Committee
created under the Presidencia (see paragraph 34 above) is specifically charged
with coordinating all facets of aviation. This group represents various
aviation organizations, and has been meeting regularly since its establishment
in late 1973. The Government has agreed to ensure the continuance of the
Transport Coordinating Committee, (Section 3.06, Guarantee Agreement).
41.       A national airport plan was prepared in 1964 and provided for the
construction or improvement of 75 airports. Eleven of the airports were to
cater to long-range aircraft, 22 to medium-range aircraft and the rest are
short-range, Of the airports catering to long-range aircrafts nine have been
completed and two are under construction. Of the other airports, nine have
been completed, and the eight airports under consideration in this project
are now of the highest priority in the plan. The Government has also agreed
that the Transport Coordinating Committee will coordinate the preparation
and updating of a new airport development plan for the country. (Section
3,06, Guarantee Agreement).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
42.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's eleventh in the transport
sector and the first for aviation in Mexico. Technical and economic studies
for the project were carried out by SOP, and the project was appraised in
the field in October 1973. Negotiations for the loan were held in Washington
from April 29 to May 9, 1974. The main negotiators were Messrs. Pedro Galicia,
Daniel Diaz Diaz and Carlos Vidali assisted by Messrs. Mario Portilla, German
Sandoval and Jose Balderrama, members of the Guarantor's and the Borrower's
staff. A report entitled "Mexico - Appraisal of an Airports Development
Project" (No. 366a-ME), dated May 241, 1974, is being distributed separately.
Annex III contains a loan and project summary.
Project Descrlption
43.       The project forms part of the National Airports Plan and will consist
of:



- 11 -
A. Construction of seven regional airports to replace the existing ones
in the following towns:
1. Villahermosa (capital of the State of Tabasco), in the
southeast;
2. Tuxtla Gutigrrez (capital of the State of Chiapas), in
the southeast;
3.  Tapachula (State of Chiapas) in the southeast;
4. Los Mochis (State of Sinaloa), on the west coast;
5. Guaymas (State of Sonora), on the west coast;
6. Minatitl;n (State of Veracruz), on the east coast;
7. Poza Rica (State of Veracruz), on the east coast0
B. Expansion of the existing airport at Campeche (capital of the State
of Campeche) on the east coast.
C. Design and implementation of a new cost accounting system for ASA.
44.       In the new airports, the project will finance construction of
runways, lead-in taxiways, aircraft aprons, terminal buildings, control
towers, fire stations, fueling systems, electronic and visual aids and
access roadse  The expansion at Campeche will include lengthening the runway
to permit jet landings and expansion of the termial building. The project
airports have been designed to meet the minimum standards recommended for
domestic airports by the International Civil Aviation Organization.
45.       The project also includes the relocation of (a) an elementary
school presently existing within the area for the terminal building at the
proposed airport for Minatitlan, (b) an existing gas pipeline crossing the
proposed airport of Villahermosa which belongs to the national petroleum
company, and (c) a high-tension powerline skirting the existing runway at
Canpeche.
Project Execution
46.       Execution of project works and contract managen eut will be the
responsibili.ty of SOP through its Directorate General of Airports, except
for the supervision of the navigational aids and communications equipment
installation which will be the responsibility of SCT. The project is
expected to be carried out daring 1974-77.
Cost Estimates and Financing
47,       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$59.3 million
equivalent, including contingency allowances; a detailed breakdown of costs
is given in Annex III. The proposed Bank loan of US$25 million equivalent
would finance the estimated foreign exchange eomponent of the project
including interest during construction (US$4 million). The balance cf project
costs would be financed by the Government out of the budget.

i rocurement and Disbursement
llS.      Contracts at each airport will be divided in five categories: (I)
airport runway, paving, drainage and related works; (2) buildings; (3) fueling
systems; (4) visual aids; (5) electronic aids, All contracts, excepting some
of the electronic equipment, will be awarded through international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bankts guidelines after prequalification of
.nterested contractors.
119.      A portion of the Fifth Contract - Navigational Aids and Communication
-~Iuipment - costing about US$100,000 per airport will be purchased from the
suppliers of similar equipment at airports throughout Mexico fo:r reasons of
standardization.
50   ~    The relocation of the gas pipeline at Villahermosa, the construction
of the school at Minatitlan and the relocation of the powerline at Campeche will
be carried out through separate contracts administered by SOP and awarded in
accordance with the Government's ordinary procedures.
51.       The loan would be disbursed against expenditures representing the
estimated foreign exchange component of all works. Annex III includes the
disbursement schedule for the proposed loan.
Airport Operations and Financial Objectives of the Project
52.       ASA, the authority responsible for operating and maintaining the most
important airports in Mexico, was formed in 1965. It is empowered to raise and
collect charges for the services provided at the airports. ASA appears to be
well staffed and able to carry out its responsibilities adequately. Improvements
are needed, however, in the provision of statistical and financial information
and in clarifying its financial relationship with the Federal Government, The
Government and ASA recognize that a first step towards the institutional improve-
ment of ASA is the design and installation of a modern cost and revenue accounting
system in order to identify the costs of providing specific services and to
permit the periodic assessment of the structure and level of user charges and
determine necessary changes. ASA has agreed to engage specialists in airport
accounting to assist in designing and installing this new cost accounting system0
(Section h.03; Guarantee Agreement).
~3,.      Although ASA is an autonomous institution, it is very new in the Mexican
context and is still in the process of evolving its financial relationships with
the Federal Government. In the past, most airport investment has come out of the
general budget of the Government; airports have then been assigned to ASA to
operate, without placing upon it an obligation to earn a specific return on that
investment. As an operating agency, ASA has not contracted long term debt and
the bulk of its profits has been deposited with the Treasury and used by the
Government as part of its general revenues. The Government now recognizes the
need to review the financial status and policies for ASA; it has therefore
agreed to carry out a study of ASA's policies, including the possibility of
borrowing and servicing the debt, and related matters. The Government has also
agreed to discuss with the Bank the conclusions of the study and their
Lmplementation. (Section 4.04; Guarantee Agreement).



- 13 -
54.      ASA has operated profitably since its formation, and from 1968 onward
its earning power has increased rapidly assisted by phased tariff increases
beginning in 1969. ASA presently earns a net return on fixed assets of about
4-5 percent and is financially sound. The operating costs of ASA are somewhat
understated because some of the maintenance work done by SOP is not charged to
ASA. In addition, there are deficiencies in the accounting for fixed assets.
The Government has agreed that in the future, the cost of maintenance will be
identified by ASA as part of its new accounting system (Section 4.03; Guarantee
Agreement) and that ASA will carry out a revaluation of its assets (Section 4.08).
Agreements have also been reached in respect of ASA's accounts audit (Section 4.06)
and limitation of accoUnts receivable (Section 4.07).
55.      The large investments in airport infrastructure which have been made
in Mexico have been paid in part by user charges and these will continue to pay
for much of future investments. The Government has agreed that ASA's charges be
reviewed so that, not only should ASA as a whole continue to be financially
viable, but also that the Bank-financed project airports should, within a
reasonable tine after construction, generate revenues sufficient to cover all
cash operating expenses, and, thereafter, contribute increasingly to general
overheads. (Section 4.09(a)(i); Guarantee Agreement). ASA will continue to
earn a rate of return on average net fixed assets of not less than 4 percent
(Section 4.09(a)(ii); Guarantee Agreement). The targeted returns for ASA are
considered adequate because the lumpy nature of the proposed investments
precludes a rapid improvement of ASA's rate of return, and many of the older
airports transferred to ASA are financially weak. In order to improve the
overall return on the net fixed assets without increasing the level of landing
fees more than is feasible, the Government has instituted a departure fee for
all passengera, domestic and international, and it has agreed that when revenues
from the departure ree are combined with ASAIs operating revenues, the result
will be a return of no less than 6 percent an ASA's net fixed assets (Section 4.09
(a)(iii); Guarantee Agreement). On the basis of ur cash flow projections it is
expected that ASA would earn sufficient funds to enable it to contribute
substantially to airport investment in the fature. Regarding the project airports,
it is estimated that all eight will cover cash operating costs by 1979 and two
will be able to cover all operating costs, including depreciation and share of
ASA head office expenses, in the iiediate future. Even though all project
airports cannot recover all costs iinediately, they are necessary links in
important air routes.
Economic Benefits
56.      The project would integrate the eight new airports with the existing
domestic jet trunk system Which will include the two airports being developed
for tourism - Zibuatanejos financed by the Bank, and Cancun, financed by the
Inter-American Developrent Bank. Because of the long distances between urban
areas and areas with the best econmuic growth prospects, the service improve-
ment made possible by the proje*t airports will make an important contribution
toward implementing the policy of regional integration of the country. Aviation

is the most rapid and reliable system of long-distance passenger transport
.? well as the most cost effective solution for this type of traffic. Airport
4eveloprent is a vital component in obtaining this objective. The expanded
o,ir route system wil therefore assist in the economic developmet of
'econdary growth centers and thureby lessen the pressure on the main rban
-enters.
The quantified econoxmic benefits of the project aret (a) cost savings
; the two main Mexican airlines, one of them Government-owned and the ther
!--ih Government minority participation; (b) value of existilg airport land
released to ownersp the Government oil company and the local municipalities;
aad (c) reduced handling time for passengers (passenger time savings). The
rate of return for the project as a whole based an aircraft cost savings alone
is 16 perceft. If the value of released land is included, the rate would be
22 percent; if, further, passenger time savings are included, it rises to
9 percent. The economic rates of return for the individual project airports,
exclusive of passenger time savings, range from 11 to 30 percent. In addition,
nonquantifiable benefits will include increased reliability of flights, improved
air safety, expanded touzrism and better economic and social integration of the
country. Recent changes in oil prices have been taken into account in preparing
the economic evaluation of the project.
58.      The savings for aircraft have been estimated as the difference between
the cost of carrying passengers by more productive jet aircraft compared to
slower and sealler propeller aircraft. This comparison has been based only
on the direct operating costs of the aircraft and disregards additional effects
on airline econc' from better utilization of the aircraft. Passenger time
savings have been estimated at working tine saved at US$6 per hour for business
travel and 25 percent of this rate for leisure travelers. This is based on the
average hourly earnings of the economically active Nexican population in 1970
earning more than about US$1,5OO per year.
59.      The existing airlines traffic structure provides a surcharge for
jet flights as compared with propeller services, which would largely cover
the direct time savings accruing to passengers from jet travel, thus trins-
ferring the benefits to the airlines. To then ascertain the benefit/cost
distribution of the airline/airport system as a whole, a separate analysis
was carried out for each route related to the project airports, giving total
estimated costs and revenues (including the surcharge) for each route for
airlines as well as airports. This system analysis too shows a satisfactory
return oan overall investment.
60.      Most of the present airports are poorly located in congested urban
areas, and at least two on the east coast are situated ma land owned by the
Government oil company (PEK1I) which is needed for expansion of plants.
Depending an the zoning regalations in the various towns involved,, the
released land - other than the two P1EX loations - is likely to be put to
high value industrial or residential use. The valuation adopted in the
Appraisal Report takes this factor into account and is based on the market
value assessed by SOP.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION Y
Ln. No. 450     Third Irrigation Project:   $19 Million Loan of May 25, 1966;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
The revised project costs are about 33 percent higher than
estimated, but the project rate of return will not be affected
because of higher than anticipated returns. The Closing Date was
extended by one year to 'December 1973,but the Bank has informally
agreed to continue disbursement until June 30, 1974 in order to
allow time to process final payments. In spite of delays in
construction and land levelling, agricultural development has pro-
gressed satisfactorily; net farm incomes have risen by 38-45 percent,
and over two-thirds of farm population benefiting are ejidatarios.
Ln. No. 527     Fourth Irrigation Project:  $25 Million Loan of January 26,
1960; Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Estimated project costs have risen by about 36 percent. Proj-
ect benefits will be higher than estimated at appraisal, but probably
not enough to fully offset the cost increases. Civil works are about
50 percent complete. The origin&l Closing Date (June 30, 1975) has
been extended by one year to enable completion of works.
Ln. No. 695     Fourth Road Project:   $21.8 Million Loan of June 26, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The project is slightly behind schedule because of initial
delays in budgetary allocations. This problem has now been resolved,
and disbursements have accelerated during 1973.
Ln. No. 747     Third Livestock and Agriculture Project:   $75 Million Loan of
June 9, 1971; Closing Date: September 30, 1975.
Progress continues at a satisfactory rate. Loan funds are ex-
pect-ed to be fully committed by the end of June 1974[ and fully dis-
bursed by the end of September 1974, ahead of schedule.
1/  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Page 4 of 5
Ln. No. 793   Zihuatanejo Tourism Project:  $22 Million Loan of January 22,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
Though the loan became effective only on March 31, 1973, the
physical performance under the project is satisfactory.
In. No. 820   Ports Project:  $20 Millioii Loan of May 17, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1976.
The execution of the project is proceeding satisfactorily,
despite some delays in the preparation of tender documents. The
operations consultants financed under the loan have completed much
of their work . The National Ports Development Stady, carried out
as part of the project, is progressing satisfactorily.   Required
revisions of port charges and tariffs are behind schedule, but the
Government is taking action on this matter.
In. No. 824   Industrial Equipment Fund (FONE) Project:   $35 Million Loan
June 2, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The loan became effective on October 12, 1972. FONEI had a
slow start because of problems in organization and promotion, but
operations have picked up and several sub-loans have been approved
recently.
Ln. No. 825   Second Railway Project:  $75 Million Loan of June 2, 1172;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The new manaL ement of the railways, appointed in May 1973, is
capable, and recent changes in operating practices are expected to
improve operations. Significant progress has been made in procure-
ment and orders have been placed for most of the major items. The
National Railways have not succeeded in achieving the operating
target established under the Loan Agreement, partly because the re-
quired tariff increases have not been introduced, and partly be-
cause of unexpected labor and fuel cost increases, The railways
have now put up to the Government proposals for a completely revised
tariff structure, including tariff increases. The Government has
informed us that these proposals are under active consideration.
Ln. No. 834   Fourth Power Sector Program: $125 Million Loan of June 23,
1972;  Closing Date:  December 31, 1974.
The loan became effective on April 13, 1973. Increase in
power tariffs by December 31, 1972 was originally a condition of
effectiveness of the loan. In December 1972, however, the Govern-
ment and the Federal Electricity Comnission (CFE), the Borrower,
informed the Bank that for reasons of domestic economic policy it
would not be possible to effect the electricity rate increase by
December 31. The loan included $35 million for payments due on
orders placed before December 31, 1971, and which were being joint-
ly financed with other creditors. With the approval of Executive
Directors (R73-23 of February 1, 1973) the Loan Agreement was
amended to separate this $35 million from the remainder of the loan.



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 5
Ln. No. 834   (cont'd)
The loan was made effective, although the $90 million which were
not being used for joint financing with other creditors were
not eligible for disbursement until the power tariffs were in-
creased consistent with the requirement that the Government and
CFE take measures to improve the company's financial position.
Power rates were increased on October 17, 1973.
Ln. No. 909     Mexico City Water Supply Project: $90 Million Loan of June
18, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Effectiveness of this loan was delayed because of difficulties
in establishing contractual arrangements between the Water Commission
and the State of Mexico. In order to permit disbursements in respect
of works in the Federal District - the main beneficiary of the project -
which had already signed its contract with the Water Commission, the
Loan Agreement was amended by deleting the signing of a sales contract
with the State of Mexico as an additional condition of effectiveness
and by establishing that no funds over $40 million equivalent could
be withdrawn from the loan account until said contract has been si-gned.
Ln. No. 910     Fourth Livestock and Agriculture Project:  $110 Million Loan
of June 18, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The loan became effective in October 1973 and the Government)
has begun implementing the Low Income Producers' Sub-Project, a
new departure initiated under this loan. It is proceeding satis-
factorily. Lending under the General Sub-Project, the other component
of Loan 910-ME, will have to await full commitment of Loan 7L7-ME.
Ln. No. 934     Las Truchas Steel Project: $70 Million Loan of September 12,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The loan became effective on October 29, 1973.
Ln. No. 968     Seventh Highway Project: $90 Million Loan of March 1, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 157t5.
In. No. 969     Rio Panuco Irrigation 23roject: $77 Million Loan of March 1, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, l950.
In. No. 970     Rio Sinaloa Irrigation Project:  $47 Million Loan of March 1,
$Q74; Closin   Date: December 31, 1960.
