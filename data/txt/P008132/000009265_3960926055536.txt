MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDE.L OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF $24.4 MILLION
TO ADMINISTRACION NACIONAL DE COMBUSTIBLES, ALCOHOL Y PORTLAND
GUARANTEED BY GOVERNMMET OF URUGUAY
FOR A REFINERY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to Administracion Nacional de
Combustibles, Alcohol, y Portland (ANCAP), Uruguay, for US$24.4 million
equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be for a period
of 15 years, including 3 years of grace at the Bank's standard variable rate,
and help finance modifications to the borrower's refinery facilities as well
as its in-house capabilities in the areas of petroleum procurement, operations
planning and control, and accounting/budget systems improvement. It will also
help finance a study on ex-refinery pricing and the crude oil import tariff
system that will be carried by the Government of Uruguay (GOU), who will also
guarantee the Bank's project loan to ANCAP.
2.       Background.  Petroleum energy, all of which is currently imported,
represents about 50 percent of Uruguay's total primary energy supply, and
accounted for about a third of the country's total imports in 1985. In spite
of signific4nt efforts to explore domestic hydrocarbon resources both onshore
and offshore, significant discovery prospects in the medium term appear
unlikely. The country's most important energy source, namely hydroelectric
power, has been nearly fully developed. Further development of other
indigenous energy resources, namely fuel wood, coal, and wind energy does not
appear promising. The prospects of improving the efficiency of the refinery
subsector to bring about reduction in cost of supply of petroleum products
have been examined and addressed through the proposed project. The country's
single refinery is old, relatively energy-inefficient, and has limited
flexibility in adapting its production profile to the demand. A significant
proportion of crude oil imported for domestic refining had been under
*        bilateral arrangements which have somewhat limited the choice of optimum type
of crude oils, timing, and prices. The current products pricing system is
based on cost plus returns at the refinery level to which fuel excise taxes
are added, thus not providing full incentives to ANCAP to maximize
efficiencies.
3.       Project Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to remove
bottlenecks in the refinery's physical facilities and improve its energy
efficiency through modifications and additions, and at the same time improve
institutional capabilities and systems to achieve high levels of operational
efficiencies. It will thus support the principal objective of reducing the
economic supply cost of petroleum products to the country to levels comparable
to international prices.
4.       Project Description.  The proposed project includes:  (i) equipment
and services to revamp and modernize the refinery's constituent process units
to bring about internal capacity matching, energy-efficiency improvement, and



- 2 -
processing flexibility to handle a wider variety of feedstocks leading to
better match between production and demand of products; (ii) technical
assistance to stren8then ANCaP's in-house capabilities in: (a) crude oil and
products procurement systems; (b) operations planning and control systems; and
(c) accounting, budget, and management information systems; and (iii) funds
tor a study on pricing and crude import tariff systems, to provide the
Government with a rationalized ex-refinery pricing system emphasizing cost
efficiency. The project will be completed by the third quarter of 1991. The
-total cost of the project is estimated at US$31.7 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$24.4 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Uruguay are shown in Schedule C and D respectively. Maps
showing general location and refinery site are attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 6625-UR, dated April 6, 1987 is  9lso attached.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project forms an integral part
of the Bank's country assistance strategy and is in conformance with
Government's objective to manage energy supply efficiently and reduce import
costs. It focuses on the petroleum refining and products supply subsector to
ensure least cost of supply through physical modification and institutional
capability improvements. The project design of the refinery revamp component
follows the Bank's approach to minimize incremental investment by fully
utilizing the current facilities as opposed to ANCAP's earlier plans to
install new, large, capital-intensive secondary conversion facilities. The
Bank's involvement has been instrumental in evolving a more balanced package
of investments, institutional improvement, and policy changes, and enhancing
Uruguay's capability to analyze and address critical issues affecting the
refining and supply subsector.
6.       Actions asreed. The following agreements have been reached with GOU
and ANCAP during negotiations. With the Government that it will: (i) carry
out a study, according to terms of reference agreed with the Bank, covering
ex-refinery products pricing, and crude import tariffs systems; and have the
study completed by April 30, 1988, and submit to the Bank by September 30,
1988 a plan of action and implementation schedule, taking into account the
study recommendations and the Bank's views; (ii) guarantee the punctual
performance of all obligations of ANCAP under the Loan Agreement including
those in connection with imports of goods and services required for the
execution of the Project. With ANCAP that it will: (i) follow prudent
financial practices, and comply with the financial covenants including
consultations with the Bank on any new investment estimated to cost more than
US$15 million; (ii) comply with the auditing and reporting requirements
described; (iii) carry out consultant studies with the objective of
improving: (a) crude and products procurement systems; (b) refinery planning
and operations control; and (c) accounting and management information systems
according to terms of reference, consultant selection criteria, and time
schedule agreed with the Bank.
7.       Justification.  The proposed loan provides the foreign exchange needs
for a high priority project, which is not suitable for packaging under export
credit financing. Alternative commercial banking resources are also not
currently available. The economic rate of return of the project is estimated



-3-
at 24 percent and the economic cost of producing petroleum products at the
refinery after project completion will be competitive with international
prices. The project will, in additions (i) enable ANCAP to develop
capabilities in accounting and information systems and in project management
techniques; (ii) introduce improved liquid effluent, and air pollution
controls; and (iii) permit the Bank to broaden its dialogue with the
Government on pricing of energy products, thus complementina the Bank's
involvement in the power sector.
8.       Risks.  Possible project risks include:  (i) erosion of spread
between international crude and product prices affecting refinery margin; and
(ii) delays in project implementation and consequent cost overruns. Estimates
of project returns have been made assuming a conservatively narrow spread
between crude and Caribbean market product prices. Further erosion of this
spread is not expected. To overcome the risks of slow project execution (and
consequent cost overruns) because of ANCAP's unfamiliarity with similar
projects, the agreed implementation arrangements, including formation of an
appropriately manned task force within ANCAP, as well as the contracting of
systems for engineering, construction and project management assistance to
ASCAP, will ensure timely and smooth project implementation. Both the
financial and economic rates of return are expected to remain over 15 percent
in the unlikely event of the spread between crude and Caribbean market product
prices being further reduced and project costs increasint 30 percent over the
base case.
9.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
