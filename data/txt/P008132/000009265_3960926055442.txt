REFINERY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:               Administracion Nacionai de Combustibles, Alcohol y
Portland (ANCAP).
Guarantor:               Government of Uruguay (GOU).
Amount:                  US$24.4 million.
Terms:                   Repayable in 15 years, including 3 years of grace at
the standard variable interest rates.
Project Description:    The Project aims at reducing the overall cost of
petroleum products supply to the country through:
(i) Refinery Conver3ion consisting of: (a) modern-
izing the refinery by revamping existing units,
installing new process and offsite units, and energy
conservation; and (b) improving liquid effluent
collection and treatment facilities; and
(ii) Technical Assistance (TA) consisting of carrying
out studies aimed at improving: (a) crude oil
procurement and products trading syfftems; (b) planning
and control of production operations using modern
optimization techniques; (c) accounting, budget, and
management information systems; and (d) efficiency of
operation through reform of ex-refinery petroleum
pricing and crude import tariffs.
Project Benefits and    The Project will enable ANCAP to better match
Risks:                refinery production with evolving future product
demand profile through improved flexibility of
production units. In addition, the project wiLi:
(i) strengthen ANCAP's in-house capabilities in
petroleum procurement, operations planning and
control, and accounting, budgeting and management
information system; (ii) enable ANCAP to develop
capabilities in project management techniques; (iii)
introduce improved liquid effluent, and air pollution
controls; and (iv) permit the Bank to maintain its
dialogue with the Government in further improving
petroleum sector policy orientation. Possible risks
include: (a) erosion of spread between international
crude and products prices reflecting refinery margin;
and (b) delays in project implementation and
consequent project cost overruns. Estimates of
project economics have been made for the base case
assuming a comparatively narrow spread between crude
and product prices which prevaileA in the Caribbean

market in the last few years. Further erosion of this
spread is judged unlikely. The Project's Economic
Rate of Return (iRR) for the base case scenario, which
assumes ANCAP's current petroleum procurement
practices is estimated at 24 percent. The ERR would
increase with the implementation of the Project's TA
component. To overcome the risks of slow project
ezecution (and consequent cost overrun2) because of
ANCAP's unfamiliarity with similar projects, the
agreed implementation arrangements, including
formation of an appropriately mnned task force within
ANCAP, as well as the contracting systems for
engineering, construction and project management
assistance to ANCAP will ensure timely and smooth
project implementation within the estimated time
schedule of 44 months from project sero date. Both
the financial and economic rates of return are
expected to remain over 15 percent in the unlikely
event of the spread between crude and Caribbean market
product prices being further reduced and project costs
increasing 30 percent over the base case.

REFINERY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
1.       Administracion Nacional de Combustibles, Alcohol y Portland (ANCAP)
has requested a Bank loan of US$24.4 equivalent for the Refinery Modernization
Project (the Project), for revamping the country's single refinery at La Teja
on the outskirts of Montevideo, owned and operated by ANCAP. The capacities
of the obsolete processing units are mismatched, constraining the refinery to
produce relatively larger amounts of low value fuel oil. There are also
considerable inefficiencies in the production and utilization of energy. The
Project will: (i) improve the flexibility of producing higher-value
diskillate products by debottlenecking and matching the constituent process
units capacities; (ii) improve ANCAP's institutional capabilities in crude oil
and products procurement and trading, and production operations leading to
minimizing products supply costs; (iii) provide assistance to GOU to carry out
a study of alternative producer pricing systems leading to converting the
current cost-plus ex-refinery prices to one aligned to the international
market prices; and (iv) improve ANCAP's financial reporting and budgeting
procedures and management information system.
2.       The possibility of Bank involvement was first identified in late 1981
when ANCAP was developing plans for installing new secondary processing
facilities involving capital investments in the $100-I50 million range.  ANCAP
followed the Bank's initial suggestions to reduce capital investments by
opting for the debottlenecking of existing facilities rather than building new
capital intensive ones. The alternative project design, developed with Bank
assistance, attains satisfactory results at a cost of US$31 million, i.e. 20-
30 percent of the original investment proposal. A consultant feasibility
study commissioned by ANCAP was completed in mid-1986. The Project was
appraised in September-October 1986 by Messrs. N. C. Krishnamurthy and J.
Ehsani of the Energy Department and Mr. F. E. Casariego, Consultant.
PART I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources and Supply
1.1      Uruguay has significant indigenous energy resources, mostly
hydropower and fuelwood. No hydrocarbons are produced in Uruguay at present
and all liquid fuel consumption is met by imported crude oil which is refined
locally, supplemented by imported products.
1.2      During the tast decade, the country has invested significantly in the
development of domestic energy resources increasing their share in total
primary energy supply from 22 percent in 1974 to about 51 percent in 1985.

1.3      Onshore petroleum exploration started in the early 1950s snd offshore
explor&tion in the early 1970s.  Despite repeated attempts by both foreign
investors (Chevron), and ANCAP with assistance of Western Geophysics, YPF and
Petrocanada, no significant results have been obtained. The prospect of
significant hydrocarbon resource discovery in the medium term appears
tulikely.
1.4      Hydropower resources have been nearly fully developed, some with Bank
assistance. During the past eight years, two hydro projects came into
operation: (i) Salto Grande (1,890 MW), a bi-national project with Argentina
on the Uruguay River, which started operation Jn 1979 providing 315 NW to
Uruguay, with an option to increase its share to 945 NW by 1995; and (ii)
Palmar (330 MW) on the Rio Negro, in full operation since 1983. The slowdown
of the economy since 1980, however, has created a temporary overcapacity
situation in Uruguay, despite an increase of power demand in the
residential/commercial sectors (Annex Tables 1.1 and 1.2). Total present
power generation capacity in the couatry is 1,300 MW. Hydropower represents 70
percent of installed electricity capacity and more than 93 percent of total
power generation in 1985. Thermal plants output has been reduced to a minimum
and fuel oil demand for power generation has dropped accordingly from 330,000
tons in 1980 to 14,000 tons in 1985 (Table 1.2).
1.5      Fuelwood is the second largest indigenous energy resource.  Its
annual production increased by about 30 percent over the last decade to about
1.5 million tons (or about 0.5 million tons oil equivalent, MMTOE) from about
600,000 ha. of forest land and is used mostly by the residential and
commercial sector (73 percent) and the balance, increasingly, by industry.
There are increasing concerns about the need for better management of forest
resources and the Government has contracted a Brazilian firm (1UNCATE) to
undertake a study, to be completed within the next few months, for the
improvement of forest resources management. Agreements have been reached that
the Governmeat will furnish to the Bank for comments a copy of the report and
afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to express its views on the findings
and recommendations related to the energy sector.

1.6      Other domestic energy resources comprise farm and animal wastes, and
wind energy. Small quantities of coal are imported. Reserves of peat and
coal have been found but do not appear exploitable economically in the near
future.
1.7      The Government policy of promoting indigenous natural resources,
whenever economically justified, has resulted in impottant structural changes
in the supply of energy resources. The share of petroleum in primary energy
consumption declined from 78 percent in 1974 to 70 p4rcent in 1980 and 49
percent in 1985. This reduction was due in part to lower economic activity
and in part to significant substitution of fuel oil by hydropower in power
generation and by fuel wood in industrial sector as well as electricity for
kerosene in the residential/commercial sectors (paras 1.16-1.17). Petroleum
imports declined from 1.8 NMTOE in 1974 to 1.1 MMTOE in 1985, but increased in
value from US$140 million (or 23 percent of country's total imports) in 1974
to US$230 million (or 34 percent of country's total imports) in 1985. In
1986, however, ANCAP took advantage of the low international oil prices and
increased its import to 1.3  0MTOE, at a total cost of US$132 million (see
Annex Tables 1.9-1.10), a significant part of it (about 0.25 MMTOE) for
inventory increases.
1.8      Further developments of indigenous resources are unlikely in the near
future until the present underutilizea hydro capacity is fully utilized.
Electricity could be used to replace wood increasingly in the residential and
commercial sectors, provided prices offer an incentive for the conversion.
This issue is expected to be dealt with in the study referred to in para
1.5. There is also a potential for reducing the cost of supplying liquid
fuels through a better match between supply and demand for petroleum products,
and improved efficiency in the refinery operations, which will be achieved
through the proposed Project. The possibility of :mporting gas from Argentina
to replace town-gas presently produced from the cracking of naphtha, as well
as petroleum products and wood, may also become feasible in the context of the
planned expansion of Argentina's gas infrastructure system.
Institutional Framework
1.9      The Government's main energy policy-making and administrative body is
the Ministry of Industry and Energy which is responsible for the overall
energy policy orientation. The Ministry consists of two operational
departments: department of industry and department of energy. The latter
con3ists of four divisions: planning, new energy sources, conservation, and
control of energy equipment standards.
1.10     The Office of Planning and the Ministry of Economy and Finance also
play a major role in the sector through their reviewing ANCAP's budget prior
to :rmal government approval. They are also in charge of the periodic review
of petroleum pricing and taxation.
1.11     Government's operational responsibility in the petroleum sector is
exercised by ANCAP which was established in 1931, as an autonomous government-
owned enterprise in charge of import, export, refining and distribution of
petroleum as well as manufacturing of alcohol, portland cement, and
miscellaneous agro-industrial products. The company is also in charge of

1.12     The private sector is active in petroleum transport and
distribution. About 98 percent of the country's retal pump stations are
operated by private companies which distributed about 80 percent of total
petroleum sales in 1985.
Energy Consumption
1.13     Primary energy consumption increased from 2.4 MMTOE in 1974 to 2.7
MMTOE in 1980, or at an annual average increase of about 2.4 percent. Since
then, consumption has declined back to 2.4 MMTOE in 1985. This reflects the
country's economic growth in the late 1970s followed by the recession of the
1980s. Energy consumption of about 6 barrels of oil equivalent per capita is
now half that of neighboring Argentina, which has a comparable CDP structure
and GNP per capita. During the 1974-81 period GDP had been consistently
higher than energy demand growth. The income elasticity of final demand
during this period was comparable with the experienze of developed countries
and about half that of Argentina. This is primarily due to the higher level
of petroleum retaii prices in Uruguay (compared to Argentina) which has
promoted a relatively more efficient use of energy resources. For the 1974-84
period, the income elasticity of energy demand is estimated at about 0.7-0.8
and is expected to remain at that level for the foreseeable future.
1.14     Petroleum products account for the largest share of ti,tal primary
energy consumption, 49 percent, followed by hydro electricity, 27 percent,
wood, 22 percent, and other forms of energy, 2 percent. The residential and
commercial sector remains the largest consumer, with 39 percent of final
energy consumption; followed by industry and agriculture, 36 percent; and
transport, 25 percent. The historical final energy consumption by source, and
by sectors are detailed in Annex Tables 1.1 through 1.5.
Petroleum Supply and Demand
1.15     All petroleum requirements are imported, primarily as crude oil
(refired locally) supplemented by small volumes of products.  Like many other
developing countries with a small petroleum market, Uruguay has limited
flexibility on crude import terms. The relatively small volumes of
excess/deficit of products make marg,nal products trading costly and
difficult. Therefore the main savings in reducing the cost of petroleum
supply would be achieved by: (i) increasing the flexibility of the refinery
yield pattern; (ii) improving the efficiency of crude procurement, and of
refinery operations; and (iii) rationalizing petroleum pricing to ensure
efficient supply of petroleum products.
1.16     Petroleum Supply and Demand Balance.  Consumption of petroleum
products increased from 1.8 MMTOE in 1974 to 1.9 MMTOE in 1980. Since then,
it has been steadily declining to 1.1 MMTOE in 1985, and to an estimated 1.0
MMTOE in 1986. The transport sector is tile largest consumer of petroleum
products with 47 percent of final petroleum consumption; followed by industry
and agriculture, 36 percent; qnd residential and commercial sectors, 17
percent. The structure of petroleum products consumption has changed
significantly in the past seven years with an increasing share of light and
middle distillates. This was primarily due to the increasing share of
hydropower in total electricity generation, reducing fuel oil consumption from
330,001 tons in 1980 to 14,000 tons in 1985. In the residential sector,



- 8 -
kerosene is being substituted by electricity and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
in Montevideo, and by fuel wood in the interior. In industry, the share of
wood and middle distillates in final energy consumption has steadily increased
from 5 percent and 10 percent in 1974, to 27 percent and 29 percent in 1985
respectively, reducing fuel oil share from 66 percent to 32 percent during the
same period. In the transport sector, no major change has occurred during the
last decade except for an increase of gas oil share vs. gasoline in the mid-
1970s which has been subsequently corrected to a large extent by an increase
in the relative price of gas oil vs. gasoline. Annex Table 1.8 details the
evolution of petroleum products retail prices. The structural changes in
petroleum products demand profile are shown in Table 1.2 below.

1.17     Over the past 7 years, the structure of energy demand hes been
characterized by: (i) a major shift to hydro electricity resulting in minimum
fuel consumption for thermal power generation, and continuing depressed demand
growth for fuel oil in the industrial sector; (ii) an increasing preference
for electricity and LPG as household fuel, resulting in a steep decline in
kerosene demand; and (iii) a smaller demand decline of transportation fuels
(gasoline and gasoil) for which there are not viable substitutes, relative to
other products. These trends will continue in the medium-term and it is
expected that despite the projected predominance of hydropower, petroleum will
continue to account for about 50 percent of total primary energy consumption.

1.18     Petroleum Demand Projections.  ANCAP's current petroleum demand
projections are conservative taking into account the recent changes in
petroleum demand profile which are based Ga a GDP growth rate of 2.1-2.4
percent per year for the 1985-19°5 period. The Bank's demand projections are
based on conservative sectoral GDP growth estimates (implying an overall lower
GDP growth of 1.9-2.1 percent p.a. compared to 4.0 percent pea. growth rate
projected in the CPP for Uruguay) and are in broad agreement with those of
ANCAP, except for relatively lower growth of gas oil and higher growth of
kerosene. The Bank's demand projections are compared in Table 1.3 below with
those of ANCAP.

1.19     To ensure that petroleum products are supplied at least cost,
investments are required to enable the refinery to produce more light and
middle distillates and respond more flexibly to changes in demand pattern. In
addition there is a need to strengthen ANCAP's institutional capabilities and
provide incentives for cost reduction through modifying the ex-refinery
pricing system. The Government and ANCAP are aware of these aspects and have
discussed them with the Bank over the past two years leading to the design of
the refinery modernization project.
PART II. PETROLEUM REFINING, MARKETING & DISTRIBUTION
Refining, Supply and Distribution Infrastructure
2.1      To s pply the petroleum demand, ANCAP imported and refined about 1.2-
1.5 million m of petroleum annually, over the last five years. ANCAP owns
and operates sea terminals for impost/export of crude and products.  Crude oil
storage capacity is about 653,000 m (6 months of imports os about 38 percent
of the nominal annual refinery capacity) of which 536,000 m is located at the
sea terminal, connected through a 16 inch, 172 km long pipeline t3 the
refinery. Petroleum products storage capacity is about 415,000 m3 (or 3-4



- 10 -
months of consumption) of which 293,000 at La Teja refinery atnd the remaining
in the interior.  Petroleum products are transported within the country3
through: (i) riverine transportation (ANCAP's barges of 2,800-3,600 m3
capacity); (ii) trucks (16 owned by ANCAP and the remaining through private
contractors); (iii) railway; and (iv) pipelines to La Tablada storage
terminal.
2.2      Except for LPG, which is distributed by three private companies
(Acodike Supergas S.A., Riogas S.A., and COWAR), petroleum products for
domestic consumption are mainly distributed by five companies (ANCAP, DASA,
Texaco Uruguy, Esso Uruguay, and Shell Uruguay), either directly (for more
than 5,000 mJ delivery) or through pump stations. ANCAP is not very active in
retail sales and distributes most of its mark It share directly to large
consumers. In 1985, a total of 1.3 million m of petroleum was distributed of
which 22 percent by ANCAP and the remaining by the private sector (Table 2.1
below). The storage capacities at main storage terminals, and the system of
transport from the refinery tankage are adequate.

Numb$r of pump stations:                  11              566           577
2.3      ANCAP owns and operates the single existing refinery in the country,
which is old, and has relatively inflexible production profile because of
mismatch between the primary distillation and secondary conversion
capacities. Due to the economic recession, the changing petroleum products
demand profile, and the inflexibility of refinery's production pattern, the
refinery in the recent years has been operating significantly below its rated
capacity to reduce exports of fuel oil surplus. This has resulted in imports
of significant volumes of middle distillates.
2.4      In order to bring about a closer alignment between refinery
production and estimated future demand for products, ANCAP initially planned a
major expansion of existing facilities, including installation of new, large
secondary processing facilities, with estimated investments in the range of
US$100-150 million. Upon review of these plans, the Bank proposed an approach
involving debottlenecking of existing facilities, and operations efficiency
improvements which would achieve substantially the same objectives at
significantly lower investments. ANCAP accepted the Bank's suggestions, and
the Project's main component has been designed to better match the refinery's
constituent units capacities, and improve the refinery's energy efficiency.
Petroleum Pricing and Taxation
2.5      Petroleum products consumer prices and taxes are set by the Govern-
ment and revised periodically based on costs plus return to the refinery.



- 11 -
Revisions to product prices are normally initiated by ANCAP on the basis of
estimates of demand, crude oil imports (including import duties), refining,
storage and distribution costs, and wholesalers' and retailers' margins. The
extent and timing of price revisions are determined by the Government after
review. ANCAP's annual profits in excess of amounts determined by Government
are transferred to the Government, taking into account ANCAP's future
investment badgets.  While this system of pricing and taxation effectively
i-sulates the refinery from the volatility of crude and product prices, which
in current market conditions can easily wipe oit all refinery margins, it has
the disadvantage of not providing to ANCAP sufficient incentive for efficiency
improvement and cost reduction.

2.6       Average ex-refinery, retention (retail price net of excise taxes),
and retail prices are significantly higher than the international product
prices (as shown in Table 2.2) because of the existing import tax on crude,
fuel excise taxes on products, operational inefficiencies, and the relatively
low level of refinery capacity utilization, which increase the unit cost of
refining.
2.7       During 1982-83, the Government allowed petroleum prices to decline
substantially in real terms (both including and excluding taxes), primarily to
control inflation. Since then, prices have been adjusted frequently to
compensate fot inflation and devaluations, while assuring ANCAP's financial
viability. In 1985, average retail, and ex-refinery weighted average product

prices were respectively 77 percent, and 16 percent higher than average CIF
import parities. In 1986, tc, compensate for the decrease in international
crude oil prices, the crude import taxes, and product excise taxes have been
increased, but not sufficiently for the Government to capture directlv the
full benefits of lower crude prices. Instead, for 1986 ANCAP is expected to
transfer "excess profits" (profits in excess of US$15 million) estimated at
about US$35 million to the Government. In 1986, the average retail, and ex-
refinery prices were respectively 194 percent, and 78 percent higher than the
average CIF import parities as shown in Table 2.3 below.

2.8      The current cost-plus pricing system is not flexible enough to
respond quickly to international price changes and does not provide enough
incentive to ANCAP for efficiency improvements and cost reduction. Rapid
adjustments to market price conditions have become crucial to efficient
operations of refineries since about February 1986 when the relatively stable
posted prices ceased to serve as a basis for crude oil and products trade.
2.9      ANCAP does not have full access to the new instruments/systems that
have been developed recently by the refinery industry to address these wide
swings in prices of crude and products (e.g. net-back arrangements, hedging
mechanism and futures trading largely through the New York Mercantile Exchange
(NYMEX), crude slate optimization through swapping, etc.). At present, price



- 13 -
variations even on hourly or daily basis often exceed the average refining
margins.
2.10     The current mechanism of ex-refinery pricing and crude import tariff
systems, therefore, needs to be studied and modified to align ANCAP's net
selling price of products to import parities, thus providing an incentive for
ANCAP to achieve and maintain operational efficiency at high levels and to use
adequately the proposed instruments/capabilities to be developed as part of
the technical assistance (para. 2.15). The pricing mechanism, however, should
shield ANCAP from excessive day-to-day variations in the market, and from the
market risk in the interval between crude purchase and products sale (3
months). Excise taxes could then be added to es-refinery prices (adjusted for
storage and distribution costs) to generate revenues for the Government, and
to regulate the relative demand growth of major products, as well as the
overall petroleum products consumption consistent with the country's economic
growth objectives. The study would evaluate the pros and cons of various
alternative pricing systems taking into account the specifics of Uruguay
market conditions and ANCAP's improved in-house capabilities as a result of
the implementation of the TA component of the project. It would also take
into account the impact of the alternatives on Government's fiscal revenues
and ANCAP's financial viability. Agreements have been reached that: (i) GOU
wiil carry out a study according to terms of reference agreed with the Bank,
covering; (ii) the study will be completed by April 30, 1988; (iii) GOU will
exchange views with the Bank on the findings and recommendations of the
report; and (iv) by September 30, 1988 GOU will submit to the Bank a plan of
action and implementation schedule, taking into account the study
recommendations and the Bank's views.
2.11     Retail petroleum prices are well above international prices and do
not appear to create major distortions. Gradual increases, since 1979 in the
retail price of diesel oil compared to that of gasoline together with the
recession of 1980s have reduced the relative demand of this distillate. The
persioting small imbalance between the demand for gas oil a3d that of
gasoline, which cause4 the country to export about 40,000 m of gasoline and
import about 80,000 m' of diesel in 1986, is likely to be considerably reduced
with the optimization of refinery operations.
Role of the Bank
2.12     The Bank's major objective in the energy sector is to assist the
Government's stated energy strategy, which aims at reducing the supply cost of
energy demand without impairing economic growth, throagh enhanced efficiency
in energy use, increased use of domestic hydro-electricity and appropriate
resource allocation through adequate pricing and taxation policies. In the
power subsector, the Bank has made seven loans to date. The latest
Engineering Loan 2484-UR (US$4.0 million, approved in December 1984) and the
Power Sector Rehabilitation Loan (US$45.2 million approved in September 1985)
aim at ensuring a more economic operation and expansion of generating
facilities, rationalizing policy for tariff setting, reducing system losses
and promoting better management of the state-owned electricity company,
Administracion Nacional de Usinas y Trasmisiones Electricas (UTE).
2.13     In the petroleum sector, the Bank's concern has been to minimize
investments while promoting increased efficiency through changes in



- 14 -
institutional arrangements and policies. To achieve this, the Bank has
assisted the Government and ANCAP in reviewing alternative approaches to the
modernization of the refinery and in selecting the least capital intensive
option compatible with the desired improvement in production flexibility.
2.14     ANCAP's initial approach to the modernization of the refinery was
based on a preliminary consultant study in 1981, which recommended
installation of new, large, and capital intensive secondary conversion
units. The Bank reviewed this study in.1982 and concluded that similar
improvement to production flexibility could be achieved at much lower
investment cost. Accordingly, the Bank recommended a major change in approach
and scope of the project with substantial reduction in investment costs by
debottlenecking the existing FCC unit and reducing production costs through
energy efficiency improvements, leaving the installation of new secondary
processing facilities to a later stage, if and when justified. ANCAP followed
the Bank's recommendation, and conducted a preliminary in-house study of the
various components of the revised project scope in 1984. The Bank assisted in
the preparation of detailed terms of reference for a follow-up feasibility
study based on the Bank's recommendations which was carried out by consultants
and completed in mid-1986.
2.15     Besides the abovementio;ied modifications to the physical facilities,
to improve ANCAP's institutional capabilities that would maximize the benefits
of the investments, and minimize the cost of products supply, the TA component
of the Project has been developed, taking into account ANCAP's current
operational and control systems, as well as the environment in which it
operates, characterized by the following features: (i) significant portion of
its crude imports had been procured through counter-trade agreements linked to
export of other commodities, limiting ANCAP's flexibility on crude import
quantities, quality, prices, and timing; (ii) Uruguay's petroleum market is
small with little volumes of excess/deficit of products which make marginal
trading costly and difficult; (iii) it lacks an up-to-date refinery operations
optimization model; and (iv) it is operating in an inflationary environment
with large and frequent devaluations, without an adequate inflation accounting
system in place. The TA component of the project therefore, addresses the
abovementioned areas, so as to develop ANCAP's capabilities in: (i) reducing
crude import cost by developing adequate market intelligence, swapping
arrangements, regional cooperation possibilities, etc.; (ii) introducing a
refinery optimization model to better adapt the quality of procured crudes to
the products demand pattern, as well as to reduce operating cost; and (iii)
improving the management information system (MIS), and implement inflation and
foreign exchange adjustments in the company's accounting system for better
cost control and performance evaluation. The abovementioned measures will
address directly the areas of possible improvements to increase cost
efficiency of domestic refining and products supply through institutional
capabilities improvements. Concurrently, to ensure adequate use of these
instruments and induce ANCAP to further reduce costs and thereafter maintain
the efficiency of operation, the TA component also includes a pricing and
taxation study (paras 2.8-2.10) which will examine alternative ex-refinery
pricing mechanisms that would be based on international petroleum prices while
ensuring ANCAP's continued financial viability.
2.16     By modifying ANCAP's earlier approach, which sought to make only
physical changes to the refinery, to a more balanced package of investments



- 15 -
and policy changes, the Bank has enhanced ANCAP's capability to analyse and
address the issues caused by the current uncertainties in the oil markets.
2.17     As explained in paras 5.3-5.6, continuing the operations of the
refinery is justified with the implementation of the Project, under all
foreseeable scenarios concerning border prices, refinery capacity utilization,
and products demand.
PART III. THE BORROWER: ADMINISTRACION NACIONAL
DE COMBUSTIBLES, ALCOHOL Y PORTLAND (ANCAP)
Introduction
3.1      ANCAP is an autonomous state-owned enterprise organized under the
Ministry of Industry and Energy. It is one of the largest enterprises in
Uruguay and is responsible for hydrocarbon exploration, crude oil and products
import/export, and refining. Sales of petroleum products represent about 93
percent of its turnover, and import of crude oil almost 70 percent of total
costs excluding taxes. Tax revenues from ANCAP's product sales and crude
import (about US$180 million in 1986) provide approximately 20 percent of the
Government's total current revenues. The financial position of the company is
very strong and the projections show that ANCAP's key financial indicators
will remain at high levels under all realistic scenarios, even if crude and
ex-refinery prices were to be aligned to the international market. ANCAP is a
large empleyer even though total employment fell from more than 11,000 in 1973
to about 6,100 presently, partly reflecting lower distribution activities but
also, mere importantly, the freeze on new employment and some layoffs during
the military regime. The professional staff of ANCAP have the necessary
competence in operating its production and distribution functions.
Organization and Management
3.2      Overall corporate direction and management is provided by a Board of
Directors consisting of five members appointed by the Congress for a five-
year term and eligible for reappointment without limitation. The President
and Vice President of the Company appointed by the Congress are also Board
members. The company's formal organization structure is shown in Annex 3.1.
3.3      The company is headquartered in Montevideo.  There are four
operational divisions (Combustibles, Alcohol, Portland Cement, and Agro-
industry), each headed by a manager reporting to the General Manager who
reports directly to the President. In addition to the four operational
departments there are six other divisions reporting to the General Manager,
responsible for: accounting & finance, industrial relations, general
services, planning & budgeting, exploration & development of mineral
resources, and systems.
3.4      The Combustibles Division is in charge of crude imports and refining
and distribution. About 2,000 staff are employed in thia division of which
950 in production, 150 in marketing, 550 in maritime transport operations and
350 in administration. The operations of the Combustible Division is
described in paras. 2.1-2.3.

3.5      The annual investment budget for the subsequent year is prepared and
presented to the Government for approval on July 31 of each year. The
financial statements are audited annually by the Tribunal de Cuentas, the
Government agency responsible for the accounts of the public enterprises. In
addition to the audit responsibility, the Tribunal de Cuentas must also
approve the annual budget prior to the Government's approval.
Investment Program
3.6      During the last five years the Combustibles Division invested an
annual average of US$8.4 million, the bulk of which was in transport and
storage facilities in the 1980-82 period. During the 1983-85 period, no major
investments were undertaken, and routine investment reached about US$2.4
million per annum (Table 3.1 below).

3.7      In addition to Combustibles investments, ANCAP invested US$2.7
million in exploration, and about US$2.3 million in its other activities in
1985. Total 1985 investment was about US$7.7 million or about 5.1 percent of
the revalued net fixed assets.
3.8      Proposed investment budget for 1986, was in the range of US$12.6 to
US$16.6 million, of which only US$ 9.5 million actually materialized. The
Combustibles Division represented about 60-65 percent of total investment.
3.9      For the next five years, in addition to the Refinery Modernization
Project, the company has projected an annual average investment of about
US$11.4 million, of which 55 percent in Combustibles, 5 percent in
exploration, the remaining in Agro-industry, Alcohol, Cement and
Administration, The refinery modernization investment is estimated at about
US$31 million excluding about US$8 million for the refinery tankage
rehabilitation which will be carried out and financed separately by ANCAP
outside the Project scope (Table 3.2 below). The investment for tankage
rehabilitation has been phased out based on a more realistic implementation
schedule. Annual average investments over the next seven years in areas other
than the refinery modernization project are primarily for the replacement and
upkeep of physical facilities and are small in relation to the revalued net
fixed assets of the company (about 7.5 percent).

Operating Results
3.10      The current Uruguayan legislation for the audit of public
enterprises' financial accounts does not require inflation and exchange parity
rates adjustments. ANCAP's 1985 financial accounts have been adjusted by the
Bank for inflation and foreign exchange gains and losses to provide the basis
for projections. Summary historical balance sheet and income statements, both
unadjusted and adjusted are presented in Tables 3.3 and 3.4 below, which show
that ANCAP's financial situation is robust, characterized by minimal long-term
debt, a very comfortable current ratio and liquid assets exceeding current
liabilities.

3.11 *   The company's general financial position is nonetheless strong.  The
current ratio was about 2.6 in 1985 and estimated at 3.2 for 1986, and the
debt:equity ratio was 4:96 in 1985 and estimated at 3:97 for 1986. No long-
term debt has been contracted during the last few years and the outstanding
long-term debt, as of end 1986, is only US$19 million equivalent, of which
US$9.6 million (from Bank of America) has been rescheduled as part of the
rescheduling arrangement of the country's total debt. The internal cash
generation covers comfortably the debt services with a debt service coverage
ratio of 3.0 for 1985. The annual investment program of the company has been
marginal in recent years and was financed from internal cash generation. It
is important to note that the depreciation provisions for 1986 will be reduced
by about US$3.0 million, primarily due to the completion of the depreciation
of the La Teja refinery which was revalued in 1973 with a defined useful life
of 12 years, ending 1985.
3.12     For 1986, the company's net profit is expected to increase
significantly to about US$50 million compared to a turnover of about US$490
million. This is primarily due to the reduction of crude import cost,
following the recent decline in international prices and the high level of
domestic prices (see para. 2.5 and Tables 2.2 and 2.3). To capture the
windfall profit, the Government increased ANCAP's import tax on crude from 12
percent to 45 percent and the average fuel excise taxes, collected by ANCAP on
the Government's behalf, on petroleum products from about 26 percent to about
31 percent, increasing the direct Government take (fuel excise tax and import
duties) from about US$154 million in 1985 to about US$177 million in 1986.
Despite these actions ANCAP's net profits for 1986 is expected to reach US$50
million, including crude inventory gains of about US$15-20 million. Since the
current legislation does not provide for corporate income tax, the Government
decided to transfer to .tself ANCAP's profits in excess of US$15 million,
increasing the total estimated Government take for 1986 to US$212 million.
Projections
3.13     To evaluate the impact of the project and alternative petroleum
pricing and taxation systems on both ANCAP's financial situation and
Government fiscal revenues, a detailed corporate planning model has been
developed by Bank staff, using as a basia ANCAP's 1985 adjusted financial
accounts. The model has been reviewed and revised with ANCAP and the
Government authorities. A more complete discussion of assumptions employed in
the model and financial results projected is attached as Annex 3.2.
3.14     The model shows that ANCAP's profit is very sensitive to petroleum
products retention prices, and crude procurement costs. Based on the current
rates of import duties (45 percent), the presently firmed up international
crude prices (about US$18.0-18.5/bbl CIF Montevideo), and assuming that the
current retention product prices will remain constant in US dollar terms,
ANCAP's net profit (before transfer of excess profit to GOU) would decrease
from an estimated US$50 million in 1986 to between US$1 million and US$6
million in 1987-1990 period, and increase after the project completion to
US$28 million in 1993 (Table 3.5). This is primarily due to higher
international crude prices (US$18.5/bbl CIF Montevideo in January 1987
compared to US$14.8 in 1986), import duties (45 percent at end 1986 compared
to 37 percent average in 1986), and fuel excise taxes (US$15.9/bbl at end 1986
compared to US$15.3/bbl average in 1986); the projections show also that an



- 20 -
increase of US$0.5/bbl of crude import cost over the above cost, with
retention prices unchanged, will reduce ANCAP's profit by about US$8-9
millioL. However, if international crude prices fell back to mid-1986 levels,
ANCAP's profit would increase to US$79 million by 1993. The profits would
increase to US$90 million if, ceteris paribus, crude cost were reduced by
US$1/bbl, which is conceivable if Uruguay can import crude from Argentina with
attendant savings on freight (see Tables 3.7 and 3.8, current pricing
system). The large increare in ANCAP's profits reflects their sensitivity to
crude oil costs. Tables 3.5 and 3.6 below show the projected financial
accounts assuming crude costs to ANCAP at US$18.5/bbl, CIF Montevideo (or
US$27/bbl including import dutles).

3.15     In the context of the proposed ex-refinery pricing study leading to
reform, the model has been also used to evaluate the impact of setting crude
and ex-refinery prices at CIF levels (corrected for internal storage and
distribution costs) on ANCAP's financial situation. However, setting crude
and ex-refinery prices at import parities would make ANCAP too vulnerable to
the present volatility of the petroleum market since ANCAP would have to
assume the risk of price variations between the time the crude is shipped
(f.o.b. loading port) and the time refined products are sold, an elapsed time
of about three months. Under current market conditions these price variations
often exceed the refinery margins. Ex-refinery prices can therefore be
aligned to international prices only to the extent that ANCAP gradually
develops appropriate hedging mechanism to protect itself from the wide swings
in the price of crude and products. Table 3.7 below summarizes the current
and modified ex-refinery pricing systems used for the evaluation.

3.16     Setting of crude and ex-refinery product prices exactly at CIF
equivalents, and the retention prices (retail price net of excise taxes) at
CIF plus internal transport and storage cost, will result in. (i) marginal
losses in the next four years and increasing profits after project completion,
assuming October 1986 spread between crude and product prices; (ii) reasonable
and increasing profits from the beginning, assuming crude to be procured from
nearby sources at a saving of US$1/bbl. Rationalizing the ex-refinery pricing
system to one aligned to international (CIP) prices would still allow ANCAP to
remain financially viable and therefore is prima facie feasible. Table 3.8
summarizes the effect of this pricing and taxation alternative on ANCAP's
financial viability and Government revenues, the details of which are in
Annex 3.2.

Financial Covenants
3.17       Financial projections show that ANCAP's key financial ind5:ators will
remain at comfortable levels under all realistic scenarios, even if prices are
adjusted to the international market. Agreements have been reached with ANCAP



- 25 -
that it will follow prudent financial practices and will: (i) maintain at all
times a long term debt/equity ratio not exceeding 60/40; (Li) not incur
additional debt, if by doing so, the projected debt service coverage ratio
would fall below 1.3; (iii) maintain a ratio of current assets to current
liabilities of not less than 1.3; and (iv) inform the Bank of any preliminary
decisions to undertake any capital expenditure of more than US$15 million and
afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to express its views before ANCAP
makes final decision.
Auditing and Reporting Requirements
3.18     ANCAP's accounts are audited annually by Tribunal de Cuentas, a
statutory Government agency, which has been found competent to certify the
official accounts based on the Bank's experience with other projects under
supervision. Agreement has been reached that ANCAP will submit to the Bank
annual financial reports audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank within six months of the and of each fiscal year, including auditor's
comments whether the covenants in the Loan Agreement are met. The financial
statements of the Company will show separately the Project accounts. Upon
conclusion of the TA component pertaining to accounting and finance system
improvement, and in any event not later than for the year 1988, ANCAP will
separately submit to the Bank its accounts adjusted for inflation and foreign
exchange parity change effects.
3.19     ANCAP would be required to submit to the Bank:
(a) quarterly construction progress reports during the first 24 months of
Project construction, and monthly thereafter through commissioning;
(b) quarterly financial statements (statements of expenditure, income,
cash flow and projections), not later than 30 days after the end of
each quarter;
(c) twelve-month and three-year financial projections within four months
of each fiscal year end; and
(d) quarterly reports of base-line measurements of liquid effluents
quantities and characteristics.
3.20     The financial projections would be initially based on ANCAP's
existing reporting system, and would be changed to the improved system based
on the consultant study recommendations on improvements to ANCAP'S financial
and accounting system.
3.21     Within six months after the Closing Date of the Project, ANCAP would
prepare and furnish to the Bank the Completion Report.

PART IV. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives and Bank Group Role
4.1      The objective of the Project is to reduce the overall economic cost
of supply of petroleum products to the country to levels comparable to
international (CIF) prices. The Refinery Modernization Project will
contribute to: (i) increasing the refinery operations flexibility and energy
efficiency through revamping of the existing facilities; and (ii) improving
and monitoring of production planning, procurement and control systems through
implementation of the technical assistance components. Furthermore, the study
on ex-refinery pricing system will lead to policy reform providing a framework
in which the refinery would operate on a commercial basis, in a competitive
environment.
4.2      The Bank has contributed to a more balanced project design addressing
the main objectives of reducing the economic cost of products supply, as well
as maintaining competitive operations through improved institutional
capabilities within an appropriate pricing system (para. 2.15). In addition,
the Bank has contributed to developing appropriate contracting system for
Project implementation (Para 4.6) that would reduce risks of delays and cost
overruns. At the same time, the scope of contracting will also provide for
developing ANCAP's general project management capabilities during
implementation which would be useful in future investment projects. The
Bank's participation will contribute to efficient and coordinated Project
implementation, and provide a basis for continued discussions with Government
of Uruguay on the pricing system affecting ANCAP's operations.
Project Scope
4.3      The main process units of the refinery, namely the crude
distillation, vacuum distillation, and FCC, are mismatched in capacity
resulting in high production of fuel oil relative to more valuable distillate
products. The process and utilities generation units are based on old, and
relatively energy-inefficient technologies. Furthermore, the liquid effluent
treatment facilities are inadeqjate and contaminate the refinery's cooling
water system. The Project's conversion component will address these
deficiencies through debottlenecking the existing and installing now physical
facilities as described in Annex 4.1.
4.4      Improvements to ANCAP's institutional capabilities in:  (i) crude oil
procurement, and products trading; (ii) refinery production planning and
control; and (iii) accounting, finance and management information systems
development and use, will be addressed through the TA component of the
Project. Each of the abovementioned areas will be studied through
consultants, based on TOR agreed with the Bank. The fourth area of the TA
component consists of a consultant study on ex-refinery pricing and crude
import tariff systems to be conducted under the responsibility of GOU leading
to their reform. The study TOR has been agreed with the Government.
4.5      Incremental utilities requirements for the Project are relatively
small, and current supply arrangements both from internal generation, and from



- 27 -
external sources (part of the electric power requirements from grid, and
potable process water from Montevideo municipality) are adequate. Current
system capacities for products storage and shipment are adequate for handling
additional production of distillates. The general location of the refinery
with external linkages is shown in Map IBRD 20369. The site map showing
refinery plot plan with Project affected facilities is shown in IBRD 20370.
Implementation Arrangements
4.6      Project Management,  The Project will be implemented by ANCAP, except
for the Technical Assistance subcomponent concerning pricing, which will be
implemented by GOU. ANCAP has agreed to appoint a full-time project
management team to be headed by a Project Manager, reporting directly to the
General Manager. ANCAP'S Legal Department will provide necessary part-time
assistance concerning contracting and other legal matters. The Project
Manager, a senior maintenance and construction engineer, with long years of
experience at the ANCAP refinery, has been appointed to the position.
Secondment of other full-time team members from existing ANCAP organization is
in progress. Appointment of the core task force is a condition of Loan
effectiveness. Agreement on Government agency, and personnel responsible for
carrying out the pricing study through consultants, as well as criteria to be
used for consultant selection, will be condition of Loan effectiveness.
4.7      Contracting Arrangements.  The revamp component will be implemented
through two separate contracts, covering: (i) basic engineering of
modification and additions to all plant sections (except kerosene treatment
'nit for which the basic engineering package will be obtained from Universal
Oil Products Company, UOP, the process licensor), and project management
support to ANCAP during implementation; and (ii) detailed engineering,
provision of procurement services, and all construction and startup. The
basic engineering contractor/consultant will be selected through limited
international bidding procedure, based on a list of potential bidders
presented by ANCAP and agreed with the Bank. Considering the particular
experircce required in performing refinery revamp work and in extending
project management assistance, limited international bidding is appropriate.
Selection of the general contractor, based on bidding documents prepared by
the basic engineering contractor on behalf of ANCAP, will include a
prequalification step and will follow the Bank's guidelines.
4.8      Staffing and Training.  There will be no net staff increase on
account of the Project. Existing operational staff will be trained at site
prior to commissioning of revamped facilities by the basic engineering
contractor. Limited number of key ANCAP supervisory personnel will be trained
in plant operation and maintenance at facilities abroad using the particular

Environmental Considerations
4.9      Surface drainage, and effluents from process area presently pass
through an oil-water API separator, and then discharge without further
secondary treatment into a small bay on the sea, which is also the intake
point for cooling water supply to the refinery. Due to original design
inadequacies, and lack of appropriate upkeep and operation, the API separator
discharges significant amounts of unseparated oils into the bay area,
contaminating also the cooling water system.. The present system also lacks
measurement instrumentation to monitor and control effluent quality. At
present there are no Uruguayan laws or standards governing effluent quality
from refineries. The current facilities are judged inadequate from the visual
oil show in the discharge area, and in the cooling water, although there are
no historical records on the quantitative flow rates and contaminants levels
at the inlet and outlet of the separator system. The conversion component
will include investment to modify the existing facilities to improve
separation efficiencies, and reduce levels of oil contamination and suspended
solids to less than 10 parts and 15 parts per million (ppm), respectively
(daily average, in the effluents, along with installation of measurement
instruments to monitor and control quality. After the currently foreseen
improvements are installed and operated as part of the Project, the need for
and extent of secondary treatment required for controlling other pollutants
levels will be determined in relation to Uruguayan effluent quality standards,
currently being developed, and implemented at a later stage by ANCAP outside
the current Project scope. Besides process effluents oil separation
improvements, the Project includes installation of two small oil recovery
separators from tank farm area effluents. The currently operative,
inefficient tank farm separator which also contributes to oil-show in
discharge area will be scrapped. Concerning air pollution, ANCAP does not
monitor air quality in and around the refinery environs, and there are no
Uruguayan air pollution standards. The Bank's loan will finance purchase of
portable instruments to measure concentration at source and at ground level of
S0xV NO , particulates, and heat densities to provide a basis for systematic
air quality monitoring in the future. The need for and extent of pollution
control facilities that may need to be established will be determined and
implemented later by ANCAP outside the Project scope.
4.10     Agreements have been reached with ANCAP that it will:  (i) install
liquid, and aerial effluents measurement devices before June 30, 1989; (ii)
thereafter inform the Bank through quarterly reports on the base line
measurements; and (iii adopt from time to time, in consultation with the
Bank, additional pollution control action in the light of such measurements.
Implementation Time Schedule
4.11     Implementation of the main component to the stage of commissioning
the revamped facilities is estimated to take 44 months from commencement of
basic engineering, defined as Project zero date. Taking into account the
lead-time required to select and position the basic engineering contractor,
the zero date is estimated at December 1, 1987. Basic engineering will be
substantially completed in 6 months, followed by about 6 months lead-time for
selection and positioning of the general contractor. Procurement of major
items will commence immediately thereafter. Civil works followed by erection
works will commence from about the 24th month and completed during a period of



- 29 -
about 20 months, followed by precommissioning and startup operation. The
implementation time-schedule, in the form of a bar chart, is presented in
Annex 4.2, and is considered realistic and achievable.
Capital Cost, Financing Plan, Procurement and Disbursement
4.12     Project Capital Cost.  The total financing required by the Project,
including physical and price contingencies, and interest during construction
is estimated at US$31.7 million equivalent, of which US$24.4 million will be
in foreign exchange. It includes US$0.75 million for financing the technical
assistance subcomponents. The capital cost estimate is given in Annex 4.3,
and summarized below:

4.13     The cost estimates developed in US dollar terms are based on the
feasibility study completed in March 1986 by a consultant company commissioned
by ANCAP, and discussed by the Bank with ANCAP. The Consultant's estimates
are based on US Gulf Coast, January 1986 costs and derived from: (i) budget
quotations for major key equipment; (ii) Consultant's in-house data base for
costs of similar process units built elsewhere, adjusted for capacity
differences, and inflation; (iii) factor costing of piping, instrumentation,
electricals and other item associated with main equipment in process units;
and (iv) estimated man hours for construction works. Adjustments have been
made to translate such costs to Uruguay conditions to estimate base cost
estimates (BCE). The costs of consultants for studies under the TA component
are based on a rate of US$12,000 per man-month. Physical contingency
provision of 20 percent on BCE is estimated as adequate to take into account
possible technical definition changes during process engineering, as well as
to take into account the rather large proportion of cost estimates based on
scale-up factors. Price contingencies are based on annual escalation rates of



- 30 -
13.0 percent p.a. in 1986, 3e1 percent in 1987, and 1.3 percent in the years
thereafter, till project completion.
Financing Plan
4.14     The major portion of the Project cost, about 77 percent, is in
foreign exchange. New external financing to the country is a critical element
for economic growth, because of savings and import capacity constraints.
Suppliers' credit availability has been investigated without success because
of the small size of individual components, which are unsuitable for such
financing.  Since the country's borrowings from commercial banks have reached
relatively high levels, additional borrowing from these sources, is unlikely
in the near future.  Although AMCAP's projected earnings will be at
comfortable levels, such earnings will be in local currency.  It is therefore
critical that the Project financing should cover all the foreign exchange
requirements, which is also consistent with Bank's lending strategy to
Uruguay. The financing plan for the Project is given in the Table 4.2 below.

4.15     The Bank loan of US$24.4 million will be'made to ANCAP, guaranteed by
COU, and will cover 77 percent of the total project cost, or 100 percent of
the foreign exchange costs. US$80,000 will be made available by ANCAP to GOU
to cover the estimated costs of the study on ex-refinery pricing system reform
(paras. 2.8-2.10). The Bank loan will be made at the standard interest rates
for a term of 15 years including 3 years of grace. The foreign exchange risk
on the Bank loan will be borne by ANCAP.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.16     Equipment and materials procurement financed by the Bank Loan will be
carried out through international bidding, except: (i) equipment proprietory
to process design; (ii) items, the supply of which is critical to efficient
and timely project execution; and (iii) small procurement packages estimated
to cost less than US$50,000 each, may be procured through limited inter-
national bidding from at least three qualified suppliers from Bank member
countries, according to the list of goods agreed upon with the Bank. The



- 31 -
aggregate amount of contracts for procurement of above mentioned proprietory,
time critical, and small items categories under the Bank loan will not exceed
US$3 million. Qualified local suppliers will enjoy a margin of preference of
15 percent or applicable import duty, whichever is the lower. The estimated
allocation by procurement categories to be followed during project
implementation is given in Table 4.3 below. The disbursement schedule is
consistent with the profile of Bank financed chemical industry projects and
shown in Annex 4.4. It is anticipated that the Bank loan will be completely
disbursed by end 1991.

4.18     The Bank Review of Procurement.  In respect of services contractor

package, the Bank will review all bidding documents prior to issue and all
selection of services and supply contractors prior to contract award to ensure
conformance with applicable provisions in the Bank's procurement guidelines.
In respect of contract of value less than US$50,000 per package the Bank's
review of procurement actions will be on ex-post basis.
PART V. JUSTIFICATION
5.1      The Project is estimated to cost about US$32 million and will:  (i)
modernize, and improve the refinery's capabilities to better muatch products
demand; (ii) improve ANCAP's institutional capabilities; and (iii) enable GOU
to bring about pricing reform, to ensure product supply at least cost.
5.2      In evolving the project design concerning modernization of refinery
physical facilities, the Bank's initial analyses considered the relative
economics of "refine" or "not refine, and import all products" options



- 33 -
corresponding to: (i) three border price scenarios for crude and products;
(ii) three levels of refinery capacity utilization; and (iii) two stages of
refinery modernization with corresponding estimates of incremental investments
required. The two stages of refinery modifications considered were: (a) FCC
unit conversion to riser cracking, vacuum unit debottlenecking, and energy
efficiency improvement schemes (Stage 1); and (b) in addition to (a) above
convert one of the smaller distillation trains to visbreaker service to
process vacuum unit residues (Stage 2). The analyses results show that: (i)
with the current refinery configuration and operational practices of ANCAP, it
would be more economical for the country to import all products; (ii) domestic
refining, under all sets of capacity utilization and price scenario
combinations, will become economical with Stage 1 of modification; and (iii)
the economics of domestic refining will improve further if Stage 2
modification were carried out. The incremental investment required for Stage
2 is only about US$4 million higher than that required for Stage 1. The
project design is based on Stage 2 modification and reflects a conservative
balance between minimizing incremental project investment, and assuring
refinery economics under a wide range of factors affecting the economic cost
of products supply to the country.
Economics of Domestic Refining
5.3      To supply its domestic demand, Uruguay has two options:  (a) import
crude oil and refine it internally; or (b) import petroleum products. The
evaluation of the "refine" or "import" scenario had been performed for six
cases consisting of: three price scenarios (Annex 5.1); year-to-year optimized
level of refinery capacity utilization; and two different refinery
configurations (current configuration and Project configuration). The results
are reflected in net present value (difference between net benefits of "refine
and import" scenario), and margins calculated as the ratio of NPV of net
benefits over NPV of crude throughputs over the life of the Project. The
results show that the implementation of the Project makes domestic refining
more economic under all price scenarios. It shows also that the economics of
domestic refining is very sensitive to the spread between crude and products
prices (Annex 5.1), and that it can be improved significantly by procuring
crude oil from neighboring countries at low freight costs. Table 5.1 below
compares the economics of domestic refining to products import.

Project Economic & Financial Rates of Return
5.4      Economic rate of return (BR) for the main component is estimated at
24 percent for the Base Case which assumes ANCAP's current crude and products
procurement practices and the relatively low October 24, 1986 spread between
crude and products prices. Products prices used for ERR estimates are based
also on October 1985 Caribbean market prices chosen to reflect the wide range
of the spread between crude and products prices (Annex 5.1). The ERR is
sensitive to cost efficiency of crude oil procurement, increasing to about 46
percent, for the base case investment of US$28 million and base case products
prices, if, ceteris paribus, the CIF c;st of crude procured were to be reduced
by US$1 per barrel.  The ERR will furtler increase as a result of implementing
the Project's TA component, concerning improvements to the production
operations planning and control. On the other hand, if the capital cost were
to increase by 30 percent from the base case estimate of US$28 million, the
ERR for the base-case would reduce from 24 percent to 18 percent. The Project
economics is robust within the range of possible deviations from the base
case, and is at acceptable levels. Increase in crude oil prices to the
current US$18-19 per barrel, does not adversely affect the Base Case ERR
estimate, since products prices have also risen correspondingly. Import mid-
January 1987 international prices imply a slightly larger spread between crude
and average products barrel prices compared to October 1986 prices used in ERR
estimation.

Financial Rate of Return (FRR)
5.5      On the basis of current domestic ex-refinery prices of products, the
Financial Rate of Return (FRR) of the project is very high, estimated at
around 232 percent. If the capital cost were to increase by 30 percent from
the base case estimate, the MRR will reduce to 179 percent. Based on
international prices (crude at CIF, petroleum products at CIF), the FRR for
the Base Cost Estimate is estimated at 21 percent, and will reduce to 15
percent if the capital cost were to increase by 30 percent. Petroleum
products prices used for estimating FRR are presented in Annex 5.2.
Other Benefits
5.6      The Project will also enable ANCAP to develop its capabilities in
project management techniques. It will permit the Bank to maintain its
dialogue with COU in further improving the petroleum sector policy
orientation. It will also introduce improved liquid effluent, and air
pollution controls, which are presently inadequate.
Project Risks
5.7      The main potential risks to the Project are (i) erosion of spread
between international crude and products prices reflecting refinery margin;
and (ii) delays in project implementation and consequent project cost
overrun. The base case assumes a comparatively narrow spread between crude
oil and product prices in the Caribbean market and the current petroleum
procurement practices of ANCAP. Further erosion of the spread is judged
unlikely and such erosion as may take place would not reduce the ERR to



- 36 -
unacceptable levels. The project will be implemented by ANCAP's project task
force, appropriately manned, and supported by the basic engineering consultant
who will assist ANCAP's task force in project management, including provision
of project control systems, which will be useful to ANCAP's future investment
projects also. The contracting system envisages selecting a general
contractor responsible for detailed engineering, procurement services, and all
construction, from among qualified contractors, using international
competitive bidding procedures. The estimated implementation schedule of 44
months from zero date, corresponding to commencement of work by the basic
engineering consultant, takes into account Uruguayan conditions, and is
considered conservative. The risks to successful and timely implementation
are thus reduced to the minimum. In the unlikely event of implementation
delays resulting in cost overruns of up to 30 percent over the base case of
US$28 million, the ERR will still remain at a comfortable level of 17.9
percent.
PART VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Agreements
6.1      The following agreements have been reached with GOU and AMCAP during
negotiations:
A. From the Government that it will:

the Bank, covering ex-refinery products pricing, and crude
import tariffs systems; get the study completed by April 30,
1988; exchange views with the Bank on the findings and
recommendations of the report; and by September 30, 1988
submit to tLe Bank a plan of action and implementation
schedule, taking into account the study recommendations and
the Bank's views;
(ii)   guarantee the punctual performance of all obligations of ANCAP
under the Loan Agreement including those in connection with
imports of goods and services required for the execution of
the Project.
B.     From ANCAP that it will:
(i)    follow prudent financial practices, and comply with the
financial covenants described in para. 3.17;
(ii)   comply with the auditing and reporting requirements described
in paras 3.18-3.21;
(iii)  carry out consultant studies with the objective of improving:
(a) crude and products procurement systems; (b) refinery

Recommendations
6.2      On the basis of the abovementioned assurances and agreements reached
during negotiations with GOU and ANCAP, the Project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$24.4 million to ANCAP, guaranteed by COU, at the Bank's standard
interest rates for a 15 year term including 3 years of grace. ANCAP will
assume the foreign exchange risk and make available US$80,000 to GOV for
carrying out the study of petroleum pricing.

2.       A couplete set of the financial projections followa, together with
the correspond S price and tax assumptions.
3.       Since projections are in constant US dollar and adjusted for
inflation and foreign exchange gains and losses, inflation and parity exchange
rate adjustments are assumed to have neutral effect in the future.
4.       The projections shown are, of necessity, indicative.  In the
financial and economic enviroment presently prevailing in Urugiay, changes in
real demand, real prices, rates of inflation and exchange rates result in more
than the usual uncertainties regarding projections. Nevertheless, the
projections show that if the current system of pricing and taxation prevailo
and if the absolute levels of prices and structure of taxes remin the same in
constant US dolLar, hICAP will make significant profits in the future years.
The projections show also that moving from the currsat system of pricing and
taxation to one that reflecto the international petroleum market prices
(adjusted for domestic transport and distribution cost) will not make AICAP a
loss making company in the long run.
S.       It is important to note that the model is based on the current level
of unit production cost (both for variable and fixed costs) and does not take
into account any positive effeet of the project on ANCAP's financial
situation; except for the crude procurement cost, for which four scenarios
have bae. developed.
6.       Table 3.2.3 below summarizes the assumption on pricing and taxation
of petroleum product.

URUGUAY - REFINERY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
REFINERY PHYSICAL FACILITIES
1.       The Project's conversion component consists of:  (i) converting the
current dense-bed configuration FCC unit into riser-cracking technology,
increasing its capacity from 5,500 b/d to about 8,200 b/d; (ii)
debettlenecking the largest of the vacuum distillation units, primarily by
changing column internals, and increasing its processing capacity consistent
with the expanded FCC unit; (iii) converting one of the smaller distillation
trainsp presently unused, into visbreaking service to process the residues
from vacuum distillation into higher-value distillates; (iv) installing a new
Merox unit for kerosene treatment; (v) changing the current middle
distillates (kerosene and gas oil) treatment unit to FCC product cycle oil
treatment; (vi) revamping and expanding capacity of gas fractionation unit;
(vii) replacing worn-out main water supply pipelines by a new, single large-
diameter cast iron line; (viii) replacing some of the old, energy-inefficient
process heaters by new higher-efficiency ones and installing heat-energy
recovery systems in certain other process and utility heaters; and (ix)
installing improved systems for process effluent treatment facilities, and
installing two new oil separators for tank-farm effluents.
