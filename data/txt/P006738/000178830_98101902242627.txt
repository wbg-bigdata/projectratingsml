INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELORENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATDDN OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR THE CAQUETA RURAL SETTLEMENT PROJECT (Phase II)
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Colombia for the equivalent of US$19.5 million to
help finance a second rural settlement project in the Caqueta Intendencia
of the Amazon Province. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including
four years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The Bank's most recent economic report (Economic Position and
Prospects of Colombia, 138-CO) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on May 18, 1973. A note on major developments in the economy since that
time is included in Annex I.
3.        The Colombian economy has shown impressive gains in the recent
past. The rate of economic growth has accelerated to more than 7 percent
per annum, and the expansion of non-traditional exports has been remarkable.
Such improvements are very much needed in order to accelerate employment
generation and to raise gross national product per capita, currently US$5OO,
one of the lowest in Latin America, to a more acceptable level. Colombia
also needs to spread the benefits from growth more widely in order to surmount
problems of poverty and population pressures in both rural and urban areas.
Concentration of land ownership, technical backwardness, and under--employment
characterize most rural areas. In urban areas, pressures of population
growth, compounded by heavy migration from the countryside, have generated
serious unemployment and a severe housing deficit. Prospects for coping
with these problems seem brighter as a result of the accelerated growth
upon which the Colombian economy has embarked in the past several years.
4.        Recent Government administrations have reacted to rural poverty
and urban unemployment in a more systematic fashion than in the past, but
much remains to be done. In spite of the passage of an Agrarian Reform
Law and the creation of the Agrarian Reform Institute (INCORA) in 1961,
only modest results have been achieved in alleviating rural poverty. Addi-
tional legislation has been enacted which lays a better basis for land
reform but much remains to be done to raise income in rural areas. In
recognition of the problems of urban concentration and unemployment,



- 2 -
Colombia's previous Government placed greater emphasis on urban development,
particularly in the housing field, but despite such action unemployment
continued to increase in most of Colombia's major urban centers. The new
Government, which took office in August 1974, is striving to sustain a high
rate of economic growth while simultaneously attempting to achieve a more
equitable distribution of its benefits, inter alia, through expansion of
employment opportunities and increased investment in education, health and
agriculture. There is more emphasis on the development of agriculture and
industry, and less reliance on the urban construction sector to provide a
stimulus to economic growth. Export diversification continues to be a major
component of development strategy and the Government is currently rationaliz-
ing the export promotion system. These development programs have necessitated
and will continue to require a strengthening of the fiscal effort.
5.        At the latest Consultative Group meeting held in June 1973, members
of the Group expressed the view that growing needs for public investment and
other public expenditures called for increases in domestic fiscal efforts.
While the Government then expressed the intention to further increase revenues
by new tax measures and by increasing the savings of public enterprises, little
progress was achieved, and the fiscal situation remained weak. To overcome
these problems, Colombia's new Government has instituted a comprehensive struc-
tural reform of the fiscal system which includes major modifications of the
sales and income taxes, and a strengthening of the fiscal contribution of
decentralized public enterprises. Discussions between the Government and
the Bank on fiscal issues are continuing.
6.        Golombia's efforts to expand exports have been amply rewarded in
recent years. Merchandise exports amounted to US$1,334 million in 1973, of
which over half came from non-coffee items. Allowing for price increases,
this represents a fourfold increase (representing an average annual real
growth of 24 percent) in non-traditional exports since 1965-67; flowers,
clothing, emeralds, cotton thread and cloth, chemical and pharmaceutical
products, sawwood, and wood products enjoyed particularly large gains, al-
though raw cotton, sugar, meat, and other agricultural products continued
to account for the greatest absolute amounts. Coffee receipts were up
largely as a result of high international prices as the volume of coffee
exports has increased relatively little in recent years.
7.        Rapidly expanding exports accompanied by more slowly rising imports,
despite progressive removal of import restrictions, have created substantial
balance of payments surpluses. Net foreign exchange reserves of the Banco de
la Republica reached at the end of 1973 nearly US$600 million, or
the equivalent of about five months' imports of goods and non-factor services
at the 1973 rate. This compares favorably with the US$345 million and US$170
million held at the end of 1972 and 1971, respectively, and to the deficit
positions that were common prior to 1968. Since early 1974, accelerated import
payments resulting from liberalization of import restrictions and lengthening
of the lag between export registrations and exchange surrender, together with



lower world prices for coffee, moved the current account of the balance of
payments from a surplus position in 1973 to a deficit for the first eight
months of last year. Sharply reduced external borrowing by the Government
has further lowered the inflow of foreign exchange, and reserves declined
by about US$120 million during 197h. Care will have to be exercised in
foreign exchange reserve management since world coffee prices may remain
weak for some time and prices of several of Colombia's non-traditional agri-
cultural exports appear to have peaked, while those of imports are expected
to continue to rise. The new Government is aware of the danger posed by the
weakening in the balance of payments, and since taking office in mid-August
has more than doubled the rate of depreciation of the peso under Colombia's
flexible exchange rate policy, moving it ahead of domestic price increases,
in an effort to hold down the rapid growth of imports and sustain adequate
incentives to exporters. Nevertheless, the Government faces the need to
strike a careful balance between facilitating a reasonable level of imports
and maintaining an adequate level of reserves without incurring too large a
volume of suppliers credits and other short- and medium-term financial
obligations. A longer-term problem is that unless appropriate action is
taken, Colombia will become a sizable net importer of crude petroleum near the
end of the decade, and the pressure on the balance of payments from petroleum
imports, should they become necessary, could be considerable. A high-level
Energy Council is studying exploration incentives, taxation and foreign-exchange
arrangements, product pricing, and other aspects of this problem.
8.         The rapid growth of Colombia's GDP in 1972-73 was accompanied by
a sharply accelerated rate of price inflation. Consumer prices jumped 22 per-
cent in 1973, as compared with 14 percent in 1972,, 12 percent in 1971, and
an average of 7 percent yearly in 1967-70. Food prices, which have a weight
of about 50 percent in the cost of living index, increased by 30 percent in
1973. The authorities have taken a number of measures to dampen price pres-
sures, including liberalization of import controls, reduction of tariffs, and
tighter controls on public expenditure, but given the weak state of public
finances, inflation continued to be a problem throughout 1974 and was running
at an annual rate exceeding 20 percent by year end. To deal with this situation,
the new Government invoked emergency economic pow-ers and moved forcefully to
implement a comprehensive fiscal and monetary reform aimed at strengthening
public finances and at producing a more balanced flow of resources through
Colombia's financial system and at providing the authorities with greater
monetary control.
9.         Colombia's public external debt repayable in foreign currency
amounted to US$2.8 billion at the end of 1974L, or US$2.2 billion excluding
undisbursed commitments. The Bank's share of this external debt (disbursed
only) as of end 1974 was about 26 percent, but this share is expected to
decline to 22 percent in 1978 as Colombia relies to a greater extent on
other external borrowing. Service on this debt is modest (14 percent of
foreign exchange earnings in 1974) relative to other developing countries.
Since exports have risen more rapidly than debt service in recent years,
there has been a decrease in the debt service ratio at a time when economic
growth has accelerated. The debt service ratio is expected to rise moderately
and peak in the early 1980's at about 19 percent as a result of greater capital
inflows associated with a high growth rate. The Bank's share of total debt
service is expected to peak at about 28 percent in 1975 and is likely to



- 4 -
decline to 18 percent by 1978. Should economic growth continue at a rapid
pace, which appears feasible, and should that growth be accompanied by a
further strong expansion of non-coffee exports and the maintenance of sound
economic and financial policies, Colombia should find it possible to secure
the amounts of external capital it needs and to service the indebtedness
that this borrowing would generate. Some of this capital will have to be
provided to finance local costs if total foreign assistance is tc be large
enough to enable the country to cover its resource gap on appropriate terms
and maintain its rate of economic growth at an acceptable level.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA
10.       The proposed loan--the 60th to be made to Colombia--would bring
the total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to US$1,147.2 million (net of
cancellations).  Of the foregoing amount, US$881.4 million is now held by
the Bank, excluding one loan of US$5.5 million which is not yet effective.
IDA has made one credit of US$19.5 million for highways in Colombia in
1961.
11.       Disbursements have been completed on 34 loans and the one IDA
credit. IFC has made effective investments and underwriting commitments
in 21 enterprises in Colombia, totaling about US$30.3 million of which IFC
now holds US$15.7 million. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans, the IDA credit, and IFC investments as of March 31, 1975, and notes
on the execution of the 25 on-going projects.

12.       Since FY 1968, Bank lending in Colombia has become more diversified
than in earlier years. All three loans in the education sector have been
made since then as were four of the eight agricultural loans, five of the
six loans in the water supply sector and four of the loans for industry.



-5-
This compares with seven loans since FY 1968 in the sectors where the Bank
has been traditionally active, i.e., power and transport. Bank efforts
have been focused on production-oriented activities and activities which
carry social as well as economic benefits. Projects being developed will
seek to combine the objectives of increasing output with maximum benefits
in terms of employment and improving the income of the poor, particularly
in rural areas.
13.       We expect over the next several years to make an increasing con-
tribution to the agricultural and industrial sectors, with particular
emphasis on projects involving small and medium size farmholdings and
industrial enterprises. The other major focus of our activities would be
in such social sectors as urban development and water supply. We would
continue to support projects in the traditional sectors of Bank lendling--
electric power and transportation--in those cases where support is required
for necessary institutional development. Projects are currently in an
advanced stage of preparation for industrial finance, agricultural credit,
and land reclamation.
14.       Given the importance of sustaining a high growth rate in agriculture
and the magnitude of the rural poverty problem in Colombia, there is an urgent
need for Bank lending in the agricultural sector with the dual objective of
increasing output and raising the productivity and income of small-scale
farmers. We have moved increasingly into the agricultural sector in the
recent past, and we expect to make a substantial further expansion over the
next few years, with perhaps as much as one-third of our total lending to
be made in the agricultural sector.
15.       The operations of external lenders in Colombia are shown in Annex
I, pages 3-h. While IBRD, IDB, and AID provided about four-fifths of total
external financing to Colombia in the 1961-72 period, their share has de-
creased since then. The IDB has assisted projects in low-cost housing,
university education, agrarian reform, ports, electric power, water supply,
transportation, and industry. AID had shifted the emphasis of its lending
in recent years from program to sector loans, particularly for education,
urban development, and agriculture. More recently it has moved in the
direction of small project loans aimed chiefly at the improvement of
income distribution.
PART III: AGRICULTURE IN COLOMBIA
16.       An exceptional regional diversity in soils and climates enables
Colombia to produce a wide range of agricultural commodities for home con-
sumption and export. In recent years government policy has been successful
in encouraging use of the country's potential to diversify agricultural
productior and reduce the excessive dependence on coffee.  This, ir., turn,



-6-
has contributed to the decline of coffee from about two-thirds to less than
half of total exports.  The overall rate of growth of the agricultural sector
averaged 4.6 percent in real terms during 1965-73, as compared with 2.7 per-
cent during the first half of the 1960's.
17.       Despite the recent favorable growth performance, the sector is
confronted with serious structural problems. Agriculture employs 41 percent
of the Colombian labor force. While open unemployment in the sector has
been estimated at no more than h percent, underemployment and seasonal un-
employment together may raise the overall unemployment average for the sector
to as much as 40 percent. Average per capita income in rural areas is only
half the level of urban incomes, and rural income distribution is skewed,
with the poorest 40 percent of the rural population receiving only 12 percent
of total rural income. The distribution of income is related to the con-
centration of land ownership: the 1970 census showed that the largest 10 per-
cent of farms accounted for 80 percent of all farm land, virtually the same
as in 1960.
18.       The Colombian authorities have recognized that the problems of
rural poverty and unemployment cannot be solved without a change in the
structure of the agricultural sector through a production-oriented agrarian
reform. Government actions since the establishment of the Instituto
Colombiano de la Reforma Agraria (INGORA) in 1961 have aimed at lessening
the concentration of land ownership and income through resettlement on
publicly owned lands and on unused private land which has been purchased
by the Government; by providing irrigation and drainage in areas inhabited
chiefly by small farmers; and by granting more land titles to small farmers.
In its irrigation and drainage districts INCORA has attempted, with varying
degrees of success, to impose legal ceilings on the amount of land that could
be retained by one owner once project works were completed. Elsewhere there
has been little outright redistribution of productive land, however.
19.       A new phase of land reform policies was initiated by the agrarian
reform act of 1973. This bill had two main purposes: first, to substan-
tially improve compensation for expropriation of well-cultivated land and
thus dispel insecurity among landowners able to embark upon agricultural
investment programs and, second, to make it easier for INCORA to expropriate.
20.       As the agency responsible for agrarian reform, INCORA has granted
about 135,000 titles to 3.8 million hectares of public lands and has acquired
some 374,000 hectares of privately-owned land of which 190,000 hectares were
redistributed to 11,300 families. The public lands are mainly in new frontier
regions such as the Llanos and Caqueta. Sixteen irrigation and drainage
projects, including some resettlement and small-farm improvement, have been
initiated, covering some 500,000 hectares. In addition, amendment of the
Agrarian Reform Law in 1968 made it possible for sharecroppers and tenant
farmers to claim title to the land they farm, and nearly 80,000 of them have
applied to IICORA. Of these, some 45,000 have had their claims recognized.



- 7 -
21.       To raise the productivity of small holdings requires substantial
inputs of technical assistance and credit. The IDB, through loans for the
Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario (ICA), and AID, through its agricultural
sector loans, have provided financing for improvements in research and
extension services. AID also devoted a substantial portion of its agri-
cultural sector loans to supervised credit for INCORA beneficiaries; while
these sector loans have been discontinued, as noted above, the Bank is
currently considering a loan for agricultural credit. Meanwhile, the
Government has directed its agricultural credit policies increasingly
toward the problem of the small farmers. For example, an analysis of the
lending activity of the Caja Agraria, by far Colombia's largest agricultural
lending institution, shows that in recent years it has been relaxing col-
lateral requirements and progressively lending more to small farmers.
22.       The new Lopez administration is attempting to formulate policies
which will give long-range direction to and be supportive of programs in
the rural sector. A central part of this process is the development of a
national nutrition plan which wculd project the nutritional needs of Colombia
and translate them into commodity needs; a separate plan will delineate the
agricultural export potential of Colombia. Together these plans would give
focus to both rural development and crop diversification efforts.
23.       In the formulation of projects in the subsistence sector, there
are two trends which are noteworthy. First, there is an increasing
desire on the part of the Government that small farmers be dealt with
collectively (in farmer groups or associations) if wide-scale development
is to occur. The second trend is towards the implementation of multi-
agency integrated development projects designed to serve both the economic
and social needs of the farmers.
24.       The Caqueta II project fits well into the overall policy objec-
tives of the Colombian Government and the lending strategy of the Bank.
It is also in harmony with the policy of successive Colombian Governments
to develop the territories to the east of the Andean region, in the Llanos
and Caqueta, as a means of simultaneously increasing agricultural output
and ameliorating the problem of rural unemployment and poverty. Provision
of social services and other follow-up assistance to established farms in
the colonization areas contributes to continued success of the colonization
effort by providing these recently developed areas with an adequate base
for the growth of output and income.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
Background
25.       Migration to the Caqueta region began during the rubber boom of
the 1930's and has been assisted by the Government since 1959, initially
through a directed colonization scheme but since 1964, when INCORA assumed



- 8 -
responsibility, only in support of spontaneous settlement. In 1971 the
Bank made a loan of US$8.1 million to the Republic of Colombia for the
Caqueta Land Colonization Project (Loan No. 739-CO). The project, admin-
istered by INCORA, was to benefit 8,000 families located in the area
through long-term credit for livestock and construction of roads, schools,
and health centers.
26.       Execution of the first project has suffered from cost
increases resulting from inflation, unexpectedly difficult physical condi-
tions affecting the road construction program, and other problems mentioned
in paragraph 33. Road construction will be approximately 200 km. instead
of the 380 km. foreseen at appraisal, and the number of colonists receiving
long-term credit will be about 1,700, compared with 4,500 originally
projected; however, the amount of credit per settler has been substantially
higher in real terms than anticipated. Disbursements totaled US$7.1 million
as of April 14, 1975 and are expected to be completed by early 1976. The
revised rate of return is estimated at 15 percent, compared with 16.5 per-
cent at appraisal.
27.       A second loan for the Caqueta Project was requested by the Govern-
ment of Colombia in 1973. The project was appraised in January/February 197h
on the basis of a feasibility study prepared by INCORA with the help of
Colombian consultants. Negotiations were held in Washington on April 14-16,
1975, with a Colombian delegation led by Dr. Cristian Mosquera, Director of
Public Credit, Ministry of Finance.
28.       A project appraisal report entitled "Colombia - Caqueta Rural
Settlement Project (Phase II)" (No. 501-CO dated May 2, 1975) is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors. The main features of
the loan and the project are summarized in Annex III hereto.
Pro.Ject Description
29.       The proposed project, a continuation of the ongoing Caqueta Land
Colonization Project, would help finance assistance to settlers in the
Caqueta region, but would differ somewhat from the first project in that
emphasis would be given to follow-up assistance to established farms,
environmental protection, and social services. An estimated 2,850 small
farmers would receive medium- and long-term credit in Phase II, and the
additional economic and social infrastructure would benefit a large pro-
portion of the overall population of the region, which has grown to 12,000
families. As under the first project, loans    would be for acquisition of
cattle and related expenses, reflecting the fact that the project area has
poor soils not suitable for anything but extensive livestock farming. Under
Phase II, some 200,000 hectares of pasture would be improved.
30.       Project execution would require an estimated four years and would
include the following elements: (i) farm development, comprising the clear-
ing of land now under forest and establishing pasture, as well as supervised
long-term credit, mainly for breeding cattle and other basic farm investments;



- 9 -
(ii) supervised medium-term credit for cattle fattening; (iii) road con-
struction, upgrading, and initial maintenance; (iv) construction and
equipping of schools, health centers, supply stores, and administrative
centers; (v) water supply and sewerage; (vi) malaria eradication; (vii)
forestation and erosion control; (viii) technical assistance and training;
and (ix) supply stores, administrative centers, vehicles and equipment
for strengthening of INCORA's project administration.
ProJect Execution
31.        Responsibility for execution would rest with INCORA as in Phase I,
and once again several other official entities would administer project
elements under INCORA's supervision./ Long-term farm credit would be
channelled through Banco Ganadero.
32.        The administrative arrangements for a project of this nature are
complex. Firm written agreements between INCORA and the cooperating agencies
are essential to insure that each agency would carry out its assigned role
in a conscientious and timely fashion. Agreements with Banco Ganadero,
COOPERAGRO, Caminos Vecinales, INDERENA, and ICA, would be signed prior to
effectiveness (Section 6.01 of draft Loan Agreement). Drafts of these
agreements were reviewed during negotiations, and found to be satisfactory.
Agreements with the Ministries of Health and Education, which primarily deal
with the operation and maintenance of facilities to be constructed Lnder the
project, would be signed within six months of the signature of the Loan
Agreement (Section 3.03 of the draft Loan Agreement).
33.       Some changes in the executing arrangements for the project
relate to the correction in Phase II of certain problems encountered. in
Phase I.  Weaknesses have been noted in the road maintenance, education, and
technical assistance elements of the first project.  These would be dealt
with in the proposed project by (i) providing funds directly to INCORA for
road upgrading and maintenance, instead of to the Ministry of Public Works;
(ii) providing funds to INCORA for school construction instead of relying on
self-help methods; and (iii) providing funds to permit INCORA and ICA to
increase their extension staff in the Caqueta region.
A Cooperating agencies would be the following: (i) Banco Ganadero', long-
term credit; (ii) Cooperativa Agropecuaria del Caqueta, Ltda. (COOPERAGRO),
credit for cattle fattening; (iii) Fondo Nacional de Caminos Vecinales of
the Ministry of Public Works (Caminos Vecinales), road upgrading and
maintenance; (iv) Ministry of Education, supply of teaching materials and
operation of schools; (v) Ministry of Health, water supply and sewerage,
malaria eradication, and operation of health centers; (vi) Instituto de
Desarrollo de los Recursos Naturales Renovables of the Ministry of Agriculture
(INDERENA), forestation and erosion control; and (vii) Instituto CoLombiano
Agropecuario (ICA), technical assistance.



34.       There are certain internal problems of INCORA.  The new
Colombian Government plans a reorganization of the agency which
might affect project execution. The loan agreement, therefore,
contains provisions stipulating that events of suspension and
default would occur if INCORA should be divested of the powers necessary
for the efficient carrying out of the project, or if the basic laws of
INCORA should be amended, suspended or abrogated so as to adversely affect
the performance by INCORA of its obligations under the Project. (Section 5.01
(e) of the draft Loan Agreement). In addition INCORA does not maintain its
accounts in such a way as to readily permit evaluation of the costs and
benefits of its programs, or the proper pricing of its revenue-producing
services. The necessary improvements in accounting will be made with the
assistance of the Bank.
35.       Finally, under the proposed project, an evaluation unit would be
created in INCORA to conduct a continuous study of farm budgets and the
rates and effects of settlement, deforestation, and herd development. (Section
2.13(a) of the draft Project Agreement). The unit would be staffed with an
economist, a social anthropologist, and an agronomist-forester.
Long-term Farm Credit and the Cattle Fattenina Program
36.       About 2,850 settlers with holdings ranging from 30 to 200 ha would
receive long-term loans under the project. Some 350 among these settlers
would have had a first loan under the Phase I project and another 350 would
receive two loans under the Phase II project. Initial loans would have ceil-
ings of 10 or 15 breeding cows and one bull, according to farm size. Second
loans would not exceed 10 head, and loans to settlers who already owne:d
cattle would cover only the number needed to bring the total herd number to
25. On average, acquisition of cattle would make up 70 to 80 percent of the
loan amount. The balance of the loan amount would go for fencing, grass
seeds, animal drugs, basic supplies for farm constructions, and, in some
cases, hired labor for land clearing. Loans would be disbursed directly to
suppliers from which the farmer is acquiring the aforementioned inputs and
would cover 100 percent of the cattle and supply costs. Farmers woulcL con-
tribute labor and materials (mainly wood) available on the farm.
37.       The revolving fund started under the Phase I project to expand the
cattle-fattening program of COOPERAGRO would be continued under Phase II.
Two-year-old animals are purchased for fattening by COOPERAGRO members.
After 20 months, the fattened animals are sold under COOPERAGRO's supervision.
The revolving fund would provide the capital needed to make about 200 loans a
year, averaging 15 head each.
Relendinpg TermsL.
38.       Long-term credit would continue to be provided through Banco Ganadero
according to ongoing procedures, which have proven satisfactory. INCORA's
/j Schedule 1 to draft Project Agreement.



field staff receive farmers' applications, and, together with Banco Ganadero's
farm planners, prepare farm plans and loan requests. These requests are
examined by itinerant loan committees, composed of Banco Ganadero and INCORA
staff and a farmers' representative, who determine whether candidates meet
the following criteria:
(a) have been assessed creditworthy by Banco Ganadero;
(b) have no access to other sources of credit on reasonable terms
and possess less than 25 head of cattle;
(c) have at least 10 ha of land cleared and under pasture;
(d) live on and operate a farm of between 30 and 200 ha;
(e) own the farm under written land title or land assignation
contract; and
(f) have agreed to accept INCORA's and Banco Ganadero's supervision
of farm development.
39.       In support of the long-term credit component of the proposed pro-
ject, Bank and Government resources (which INCORA would repay to the Govern-
ment in 20 years, with four years of grace, without interest) would be lent
by INCORA to Banco Ganadero at 9 percent interest, with Banco Ganadero
assuming the credit risk. Banco Ganadero would repay INCORA under an amorti-
zation schedule substantially reflecting the aggregate of the amortization
schedules of the long-term loans to farmers made by Banco Ganadero. The
estimated 2,850 participating farmers would repay Banco Ganadero over 12 years
(including a three-year grace period) at 15 percent interest. INCORA would
thus have the use of some of these repayments for some time prior to repaying
the Government under the aforementioned amortization schedule for the Govern-
ment loan to INCORA. These resources, in addition to those resulting from the
9 percent spread which INCORA would receive, would be used for the execution
and expansion of INCORA's credit and land reform activities. The 15 percent
lending rate to participating farmers compares favorably with an effective
rate of 6.25 percent paid by farmers under Phase I, but it is still a negative
rate of interest should current rates of inflation--over 20 percent per annum--
continue. However, there is some prospect of deceleration of inflation, and
without such assistance beneficiaries with less than 50 ha--above one quarter
of the total--would have little incentive to participate in the program,
given the modest size of their incremental income. Moreover:
(a)  there are at present no satisfactory alternative systems of subsidi-
zation available to assist the settlers in making a success of their
migration to the Caqueta area; several systems, including subsidiza-
tion of cattle prices or the purchase of new settlers' grain
production at higher than market prices, have been investigated,
but they would require complex controls; and
(b)  the problems posed by the inherent fungibility of credit and
possible misallocation of resources are minimized because of
INCORA's and Banco Ganadero's close supervision, the benefi-
ciaries' lack of fungible resources, and because of the fact
that loans are not disbursed to the settlers in cash.

Should the Government decide to change the interest rate regulations affect-
ing agriculture loans currently in force, the proposed interest rate of
15 percent would be subject to review. If the Bank and the Borrower cannot
agree on new conditions of lending within six months, new lending would be
suspended until such agreement is reached. (Section 3.04 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
40G       For the cattle-fattening phase of the project, Bank and Government
funds would be lent by 1IECORA to COOPERAGRO at 18 to 20 percent interest per
annum. When the animals are sold under COOPERAGRO's supervision after 20
months, the individual farmer would receive 60 percent of the gross profit.
(Alternatively, INCORA would be able to make such loans directly to farmers
at 20 percent interest per annum). COOPERAGRO would repay the principal of
the loan to INCORA in two equal installments at the end of the 20th and 40th
month, and INCORA would reinvest in the revolving fund as required to maintain
the fund's value.
Road Construction
41.       About 200 km of roads would be constructed to continue those started
under the Phase I project. The construction schedule, calling for completion
of an average of 50 km per year, corresponds to performance under the Phase I
project during the 1973/74 period. A consulting firm or specialized agency
would handle design and supervision. Road standards would be the same as
those for Phase I roads except that cuts and embankments would be designed
with gentler slopes and protected to prevent erosion. Assurances were
obtained from Government that anti-erosion measures would be taken to
protect project roads. (Section 4.02(b) of the draft Loan Agreement.)
Complementary Road Works
42.       Because of the difficulties encountered in constructing roads in
the heavy forest, more complementary works are required on them during the
first years than on roads constructed in more open and accessible areas.
Thus the project would provide for the purchase and operation of machinery
for upgrading and maintaining such roads during the project period. The
machinery purchased would consist of two motorgraders, one bulldozer, two
loaders, one trailer, eight dumpers, and ancillary equipment. It would
remain INCORA's property and be pooled with equipment owned by Caminos
Vecinales. Annual costs per km for these complementary works would average
Col$20,000 (US$780) during year one but decrease to Col$15,400 (US$600) by
project year four.
Education Services
43.       The project would continue INCORA's school construction program
by building about 30 primary schools, averaging 150 m2 each. The program



- 13 -
would be executed either directly by INCORA or by Instituto Colombiano de
Construcciones Escolares (ICCE), a specialized agency within the Ministry
of Education. The project would also provide each of the 500 primary
schools in Caqueta with sets of teaching aids and a supply of reading
materials. Reading materials would also be supplied for adult training
courses given by Accion Cultural Popular (ACPO).
Health Services
44.       Ten health posts and two health centers would be constructed and
supplied with necessary equipment at average unit costs of Col$0.5 million
and Col$1.0 million, respectively. Some Col$23.8 million would also be
provided for a health program focusing on malaria control and improvement
of hygienic conditions in rural centers.
Forestry and Erosion Control
45.       The project would assist an erosion control program to be imple-
mented by INDERENA. The program would encompass (a) a nine-month study to
identify a suitable pilot project area in the Cordillera where socio-economic
effects of anti-erosive measures could be analyzed and (b) the demarcation
and protection of a 20,000-ha forest reserve in which to conduct trials to
determine the most appropriate species to be planted on eroded river banks
and to replace natural forest for commercial exploitation. The reserve would
also be the basis for identification studies of future reserves in un-
settled areas where larger blocks of forest could be conserved. The establish-
ment of this reserve would give INDERENA its first opportunity to test the
application of protective measures for forest reserves in the Amazon against
settlers' incursions. The problem of overgrazing in the foothills would be
reduced by intensifying farmers' technical assistance. Since conservation
efforts in other parts of the country have often failed because of lack of
financial support, assurances were obtained from the Government that it
would allocate to INDERENA sufficient funds to operate and maintain the
forest reserve after the end of the project development period. (Section
4.03 of the draft Ioan Agreement.)
Technical Assistance
46.       A unified extension service that would improve small farmers'
Animal husbandry methods and pasture management would be established. Pri-
mary objectives would be to reduce overgrazing and increase farmerst income.
This project component would be carried out by INCORA with the assistance
of ICA and would cover the salaries of U1 animal husbandry and two agri-
cultural officers (at Col$120,000 each per year) and 10 additional field
agents (at Col$80,000 each per year) during the four project years, as well
as their vehicles, training materials, and inputs for 'demonstrations.



Project Administration
47.       Project administration costs would cover salaries of INOCRA's
Project Manager and five Section Chiefs; headquarter overheads (about two
percent of investment costs); salaries of additional staff needed to expand
operations, including about 10 credit supervisors; and operations of the
evaluation unit. Vehicles and equipment (particularly topographic) would
also be provided, and three new offices accessible by road in Curillo,
Solano, and Cartagena would be constructed.  Finally, three farm input
supply stores would be built by INCORA in remote rural centers and trans-
ferred on completion to Central de Cooperativas de la Reforma Agraria Ltda.
(CECORA). Assurances were obtained that a draft agreement between INCORA
and CECORA about these stores would be submitted to the Bank for approval
within one year after loan signature. (Section 2.09 of the draft Project
Agreement.)
ProJect Cost and Financing
48.       Estimated project cost is the equivalent of US$37.1 million, of
which US$5.3 million is allocated for price contingencies. The proposed
Bank loan of US$19.5 million would be made to the Government (which would
bear the exchange risk), and the loan would cover 53 percent of total project
cost, including estimated foreign exchange costs of US$8.1 million or 22 per-
cent of the total and a US$11.4 million portion of local costs. The balance
of the local costs would be financed by the Government (the equivalent of
US$12.1 million, or 32 percent of the total) and by the settlers themselves
(the equivalent of US$5.5 million or 15 percent of the total), in the form of
farm labor and materials.
Marketing
49.       Under Phase II of the Caqueta project some 200,000 hectares of
pasture would be expected to be improved, capable of supporting a cattle
population of about 226,000 head. This would result in annual sales of some
40,000 head at full development in 1995. The increased output resulting
from both Phases I and II together would be approximately 75,000 head
annuaIly (30,000 tons liveweight) at full development, or 23 percent over
what regional production would be without the project. The cattle-fattening
element would add an estimated additional 3,000 steers annually to sales.
It should be noted that construction of a slaughterhouse in the region is
envisaged by Banco Ganadero.
50.       Beef production resulting from the project could be readily
absorbed by the domestic marketj which is growing steadily, especially in
urban areas. At present the caqueta region produces about 33,000 tons
liveweight annually of which about 40 percent is marketed locally and
60 percent absorbed by other regions, mainly Cali.



- 15 -
51.       During the early years of the project, as land is cleared, farmers
would raise maize, rice, pigs, and other staple food crops. Output would be
used mainly for on-farm consumption, but any surplus grain production would
be purchased by the Instituto de Mercadeo Agropecuario (IDEMA).
Farm Income
52.       The proposed project would provide credit and other benefits to
families working 30 to 200 hectares. Though the data are not precise,
indications are that such families' per capita incomes may average as low
as US$70, assuming six to seven people per family. Other very rough
estimates indicate that the poorest 140 percent of the Colombian population
receive an average per capita income of about US$100. Our projections
indicate that with total development costs approximating US$6,600 per family,
including the reimbursable loan of US$3,600 per family, per capita incomes
of the some 4,700 families directly participating in Phase I and II would
be raised at full development after 20 years to the order of US$250 for
families working 30 hectares and US$550 for 200 hectare farms. It thus
seems clear that the proposed project would serve the Government's objectives
of increasing output and improving the income of the poor, particularly in
rural areas.
Procurement
53.       Procurement procedures which have proved satisfactory in Phase I
would be continued in Phase II. Road construction and road maintenance
equipment would be purchased by international competitive bidding. A 15 per-
cent preference in such international bidding would be accorded to suppliers
of equipment manufactured in Colombia. Contracts for all other construction
and for purchase of equipment and materials would be awarded on the basis of
INCORA's local bidding procedure, or that of ICCE (if ICCE is utilized by
IhCORA to carry out the school construction program). Local bidding pro-
cedures are acceptable to the Bank because foreign firms would not be
interested in contracts to erect small buildings in that remote Amazon
region, and because the equipment and materials concerned would be in small
quantities. However, certain of the items to be procured under local
bidding would be of foreign origin.
Disbursements
54.       The proceeds of the Bank loan would be used to finance 70 percent
of the amounts disbursed by INCORA for medium- and long-term credit programs;
70 percent; of expenditures on road construction and buildings; 50 percent of
expenditures on water supply and sewerage systems; and 70 percent of expendi-
tures on the education, forestation and erosion control, and technical assist-
ance programs. The Bank loan would also finance 100 percent of foreign-
exchange expenditures on vehicles, equipment, and anti-malaria products or
95 percent of the ex-factory cost of such locally-produced items. About
US$3.3 million of the Bank loan would initially be unallocated as a contingency
reserve. Disbursement would be made against statements of expenditure



- 16 -
submitted by INCORA on behalf of the Government and supported by documenta-
tion which would be available for inspection by Bank supervision missions.
Disbursement claims for long-term credit would be supported by certified
statements from the Banco Ganadero and claims for road construction by
statements from the Engineering consultants.
Economic Rate of Return and Justification
55.       The economic rate of return for Phase II, when costs and benefits
are discounted over a 23-year project life, has been calculated at 13.8 per-
cent. This compares with a rate of return in Phase I of 15.0 percent. The
rate of return for both phases combined is 1.1 percent.
56.       Benefits to farm families in the Caqueta region who are not partici-
pating in the credit program were included in the rate-of-return ca:Lculation
only insofar as such families would benefit from reduced transportation costs
for their farm output as a result of project roads. Neither benefits nor
costs were included for the education and health programs, in view of the
difficulty of quantifying such benefits. Nor were benefits included from
the forestry and erosion control element of the second project, or from the
reduced cost of transportation of persons.
57.       The project would provide direct assistance in the form of super-
vised long-term credit and technical assistance to some 2,850 low-income
farmers. Though the size of their farms would range upward to 200 hectares,
this is not a large holding in an area characterized by poor soils, suitable
only for extensive livestock farming. The maximum herd financed for any
participant would be 25 head, apart from other animals on loan for fattening.
By facilitating the economic progress of these farmers who are highLy moti-
vated to improve the income of their families by migrating to an area
requiring extremely hard physical work in a difficult environment, the
project would be consistent with the objective of more equitable income
distribution in Colombia. Similarly, it would be consistent with the
objective of reducing the pressure of urban migration. In addition to the
2,850 direct beneficiaries, a large proportion of the 12,000 families living
in the region would benefit from the roads, social services, erosion control,
and improved availability of technical assistance and training to be provided
under the project.
58.       Finally, the value of annual meat production in Colombia would be
increased by the proposed project at full development by US$8.9 miLlion
(1974 dollars), which would create indirect foreign exchange earnings by
freeing meat produced closer to ports for export abroad.

PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
59.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Colombia and the
Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and Instituto Colombiano
de la Reforma Agraria, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section h (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of
a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The draft agreements conform to the normal
pattern for loans for rural settlement projects.
60.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
61.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.

COLOMBIA - MEMORANDUM ON RECENT ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS L
A. Recent Economic Developments
Economic Growth
1.         The Colombian economy has performed impressively in a number of
important respects in the past several years. Real growth of gross domestic
product accelerated from an average of 4.7 percent in 1950-67 to an average
of 6.4 percent over the 1967-72 period. During the past two years, Colombia
has sustained even higher rates of growth, 7.1 percent in 1972 and 7.3 percent
in 1973, the highest rates of growth achieved in 25 years. Strong expansion
of the industrial, agricultural, and in 1973, construction sectors, rapid
growth of non-traditional exports, and favorable coffee prices were the key
factors in this achievement. Preliminary indications are that GDP growth has
decelerated slightly in 1974 as a result of a slowdown in the construction
boom and a weakening of coffee prices. While industry continues to be the
leading growth sector, expanding by 10 percent in real terms in 1973 and
accounting for about 30 percent of growth of GDP, a boom in construction
generated an increase in value added by that sector of 12.6 percent. Despite
rapid growth of the labor-intensive construction sector, unemployment has
continued to increase in most of Colombia's major urban centers, in part as
a result of accelerated rural to urban migration. While the rate of growth
of agriculture (4.8 percent in 1973) was well above the historical average,
most of the growth was concentrated in agricultural commodities for export.
Lagging production for domestic consumption, insufficient to keep pace with
domestic demand has contributed to inflationary pressures. Mining production
has declined steadily for the past several years as a result of declining
petroleum production.
Inflation
2.         Inflation has become a serious problem in Colombia and seems likely
to persist for some time, despite a number of measures taken in recent months
to combat it. The cost-of-living index is expected to have risen by about 25 percent
in 1974 as compared to 22 percent last year, 14 percent in 1972, 12 percent
in 1971, and an average of 7 percent per year between 1967 and 1970. Accelera-
tion in the rate of inflation during 1973 and the first quarter of 1974 was
the result of a surge in the level of demand stemming from (a) the substantial
increase in the income of the export sector; (b) the large fiscal deficit in
the cash operations of the public sector; and (c) continued strong private
investment. Rising cost of imports, labor and credit, combined with tight
controls on imports and a decline in the output of agricultural production
for domestic consumption further aggravated inflationary pressures. Measures
adopted in late 1973 and early 1974 to limit the rate of expansion of aggregate
demand and increase aggregate supply have begun to take hold and the rate of
Zi. This memorandum was prepared in January 1975 and incorporates the
preliminary findings of a Bank economic mission which visited Colombia
in that month. The mission's full report will be issued to the
Executive Directors in June 1975.

inflation has declined during the second and third quarters of 1974. However,
increasing pressure for substantial upward wage adjustments from organized
labor and the need to eliminate some subsidies and allow upward adjustment
in prices of a number of items which have been controlled for the past 12
months have caused some increase in the rate of inflation during recent
months. Progress in reducing the rate of inflation in 1975 will depend
heavily upon the Government's success in arresting the deterioration in
public finances which has taken place since 1972.
Balance of Payments
3.         Colombia's rapid growth in 1972-73 was sparked by strong growth of
coffee and most minor exports which permitted a large accumulation of foreign
exchange reserves. Coffee exports increased an estimated 34 percent to
US$630 million, largely as a result of continuation of the upsurge in world
coffee prices (an average of US$0.73 per pound in 1973 as compared to US$0.57
in 1972) which began in mid-1972 as Brazilian coffee production declined. Of
even more significance from the point of view of the long-term growth of the
Colombian economy was the continued strong performance of minor exports which
increased 48 percent to US$680 million. Price rises for these goods accounted
for a significant proportion of the increase, but volume exported also rose
by a substantial 15 percent. Despite the impressive 40 percent increase in
total export earnings which took place in 1973, Colombia continued throughout
most of the year to maintain tight controls on imports. As a consequence the
value of imports exceeded the 1972 level by only 22 percent, not substantially
more than the increase in import prices. The increased real availability of
imported goods accordingly did little to dampen domestic inflationary pressures.
Despite official measures to speed up import payments and to reduce foreign
exchange inflows to the Bank of the Republic arising from private borrowing
abroad, official reserves increased from US$345 million at end-1972 to US$524
million at end-1973.
4.         Export performance during the first seven months of 1974 was out-
standing.  Higher world coffee prices and a 32 percent increase in the volume
shipped resulted in a 36 percent increase in coffee export registrations
during this period as compared to the same period of 1973. Registrations of
non-traditional exports increased 51.4 percent through July, an increase of
over 30 percent in real terms. Exports of manufactured products have been a
major element in the strong expansion of non-traditional exports with earnings
from textiles increasing three-fold, while those from chemicals and pharmaceuti-
cals, and metals and metal products, doubled. Import liberalization has led
to accelerated import payments and there has been a lengthening of the lag
between export registrations and exchange surrender. Thus, despite strong
export performance the current account of the balance of payments has shifted
from a surplus of over US$100 million during the first seven months of 1973
to a deficit of US$80 million during the same period of this year. Sharply
reduced external borrowing by the Government has further lowered the inflow
of foreign exchange, and reserves probably declined by about US$120 million
during 1974.



ANNEX I

5.        The decline in foreign exchange reserves of US$120 million for
1974 by year end still left an appropriate cushion of reserves, sufficient
to cover about 4 months of imports. F-Voreigni exchange reserve lmanagement
over the next eighteen months should aim at preventing further losses, since
world coffee prices may remain weak for some time, and prices of several
of Colombia's non-traditional agricultural exports appear to have peaked,
while those of imports are expected to continue rising. The new government
is aware of the possibility of some deterioration in the terms of trade
and is attempting to sustain the high rate of growth of non-traditional
exports by accelerating devaluation of the peso so as to compensate exporters
for the differential between internal and external inflation. Since mid-
August the rate of depreciation of the peso has been substantially greater
than the differential between domestic and world inflation and the Government
intends to continue this policy for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless,
the Government faces the need to strike a careful balance between facilitating
a reasonable level of imports and maintaining an adequate level of reserves
without incurring too large a volume of suppliers' credits and other short-
and medium-term obligations.
6.        Available data indicate that Colombia's public external debt
outstanding at the end of 1973 came to US$2.6 billion, of which US$1.9
billion had been disbursed. During 1973 contracts were signed to borrow
US$421 million (of which US$305 million were project loans).   The levels and
composition of 1973 borrowing closely approximated the amounts set forth in
the 1973 project list (as described in the May 1973 IBRD Economic Report net
of expected slippage and droppage). An estimated disbursement of US$340
million on public external borrowing occurred in 1973, as compared to US$355
million in 1972 and US$223 million in 1971. While disbursements on project
loans increased 20 percent in 1973, a slowdown of such disbursements has
taken place since late 1973, reflecting a scarcity of local counterpart funds
stemming from a deteriorating fiscal performance.
Public Finances
7.         Deterioration of Colombia's public finances since 1971 has made
it increasingly difficult for the authorities to manage aggregate demand so
as to contain inflation while maintaining a desirable pace of development.
Despite an average annual real rate of growth of GDP in excess of 7 percent,
National Government tax revenue has failed to show any significant increase
in real terms and, as a percentage of GDP, declined from the peak of 9.4 per-
cent in 1971 to an expected 7.4 percent in 1974. This weakening in domestic
resource mobilization through the tax system was, in 1972 and 1973, reflected
in increased Government recourse to general purpose external borrowing to
cover the Government's cash deficit, and in declining real levels of public
investment. In order to overcome these problems, the new Government has
initiated a comprehensive structural reform of the fiscal system which includes
major modification of the sales and income taxes, elimination of the wheat
subsidy, reduction of fiscal incentives for non-traditional exports, and
strengthening of the fiscal contribution of decentralized public enterprises.
The reform has not yet been fully put into effect, but it could, if fully
implemented and supplemented by an urban property tax and measures to
eliminate the excessive subsidy of gasoline consumption, produce a sub-
stantial strengthening of public finances.

B. Development Problems and Policy Requirements
While Colombia's growth arAd balance of payments performance have
been excellent in recent years, lagging performance in several important other
areas could, if permitted to continue, jeopardize the country's developmient
effort. The key areas where policy action is required include improving
the performance of the petroleum sector, expanding public savings and
investment, improving the flow of resources through the financial system
and further improving income distribution and the employment situation.
Petroleum
9.         Colombia is fortunate in having sufficient crude petroleum supplies
to escape any immediate adverse balance of payments' effect of recent in-
creases in world oil prices. However, an unrealistic pricing policy has, in
recent years, encouraged excessive consumption and contributed to a decline
in output. While the internal reference price paid to producers for "new"
crude oil was increased to US$4 per barrel in February 1974, prices to
producers for petroleum flowing from existing fields as well as prices at
the refinery and consumer levels have not been changed since June 1971, and
are far below prices in international markets.
10.        Crude oil production has declined 20 percent since 1970, and crude
exports have stopped altogether. Creation of appropriate incentives for in-
creased exploitation of oil from fields already in prcduction, and a modest
dampening of domestic demand by means of long-overdue price increases, would
permit Colombia to hold off crude oil imports until 1979-80. If decisive
action is taken in the months ahead to encourage exploration and drilling,
it is entirely possible that new oil, sufficient to meet domestic demand,
could become available in 5-6 years. Failure to act in the immediate future,
however, could, in the early 1980's, result in a heavy burden on Colombia's
balance of payments.
11.        Prices of petroleum products are controlled by the Government and
the retail price of gasoline is among the lowest in the world (regular
gasoline is US$0.12/gallon). Considering the country's supply and demand
situation, product prices to the consumer and at the different stages of
production should be increased so as to be more in line with international
prices. Such a price adjustment should be done as soon as possible since
low petroleum product prices have not only discouraged production of petroleum,
but have diverted attention from development of the abundant coal, natural
gas, and hydroelectric resources which Colombia possesses. Hydropower, coal,
and natural gas currently account for only 4 percent, 12 percent, and 17 percent,

respectively, of energy production and there is considerable scope for sub-
stituting these alternative energy sources for petroleum'. To develop them
will, however, require careful planning and sizable capital outlays, as well
as proper pricing to encourage an appropriate energy balance. There is a
close relationship between petroleum pricing policy and the fiscal situation
since price increases of petroleum products would increase the Central Govern-
ment's fiscal resources through further improved finances of the State-owned
oil company, ECOPETROL, and through increased gasoline tax collections. This
would help to overcome the revenue shortfalls which hamper the investment
program and which limit the government's ability to reduce present inflationary
pressures.
Public Savings and Investment
12.        Notwithstanding the booming production and trade conditions of the
economy over the past few years, Colombia's public finance performance has
been disappointing. Largely because of poor tax collections in 1972 and 1973
(especially for the income tax) the real current surplus in both years was
below that in 1971. The real decline in income tax collections in 1973 oc-
curred despite a 7.3 percent increase in real GDP and reveals a serious
weakness in income tax administration. Real public investment spending in
1973, covered in part by severe compression of current outlays and by
US$80 million in Eurocurrency borrowing, fell sharply despite the continued
pressing need for expanded social and economic infrastructure. Preliminary
data for 1973 indicate that the decline in public investment has not been
offset by an increase in private investment and that the share of total
investment in GDP has fallen from an average 21.4 percent in the 1969-72
period to 19.3 percent in 1973. Without substantial strengthening of public
finances, public investment could continue to decline in real terms and the
expansion of the private sector could be constrained by lack of complementary
social and economic infrastructure.
13.         Reliable data are not yet available concerning Colombia's overall
public sector accounts for 1971-74, but enough is known to make it clear that
the decline in National Government investment during this period was not
offset by spending in the rest of the public sector. The new Government is
aware of the need for increased investment by decentralized public sector
agencies and is expected to move rapidly in the coming months to assure an
appropriate increase in the internally generated resources of these agencies.
Deficits of public enterprises in the electric power, water and sewerage,
and telecommunications sectors, with the exception of Empresa Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones (TELECOM),have risen in recent years as a result of lagging
tariffs. Three decentralized enterprises, Empresa Colombiana de Petroleos
(ECOPETROL), TELECOM and Empresa Colombiana de Puertos (COIPUERTOS), have in
the past few years accounted for 90 percent of the total current surplus of
the public enterprises. Dissaving of public enterprises was concentrated in
four enterprises; IDEMA (the Government's agricultural marketing agency), the
Railways (CNR), Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario (ICA), and Instituto Colombiano
de la Reforma Agraria (INCORA). In the rest of the public sector the tendency
has been for savings to decline also since 1969. As a result total public
savings fell from 7.0 percent of GDP in 1969 to 5.0 percent in 1973.

14.       The recently completed fiscal reform contains an impressive array
of measures aimed at (a) increasing tax revenue; (b) improving the progres-
sivity of the tax system by reducing the tax burden on the lowest income
groups, increasing taxes on the highest income groups, and by closing
numerous loopholes which have permitted high income groups to avoid paying
taxes; (c) increasing the elasticity of the tax system; and (d) improving
tax administration. While it will be several months before the revenue
implications of the fiscal reform become completely clear, preliminary
estimates indicate that new tax revenue of about Col$2.5 billion will be
generated in 1975. In addition, elimination of the wheat subsidy has
reduced the need for transfers to IDEMA by an estimated Col$1.2 billion
in 1975. The outlook for 1975 is for a sharply reduced National Government
deficit as the recent revenue generating measures begin to take hold.
The Central Government deficit should be reduced from about 2 percent
of GDP in 1971-72 to 0.2 percent in 1975; but it must be noted that this
is likely to be achieved only with the help of a further reduction in
real terms in investment expenditures by the National Government.
Reform of the Financial System
15.         In August 1974, the new administration introduced a series of execu-
tive decrees and resolutions aimed at domestic monetary reform. These measures
involve restructuring of interest rates, including establishment of a maximum
ceiling on the rate of monetary correction, a simplification of Colombia's
complex reserve requirement system, the elimination of numerous portfolio
requirements, the elimination of several rediscount facilities, and the
adoption of more stringent controls over existing facilities. In broad terms,
these measures should produce a more balanced flow of resources through
Colombia's financial system and provide the authorities with greater control
over the functioning of the monetary system.
Income Distribution and Employment
16.        Despite the paucity of suitable statistics it seems clear that the
existing distribution of personal income is markedly unequal. The poorest
fifth of the population appears to be receiving 3 percent of total income,
while the richest fifth gets about 60 percent. Not much can be said about
changes over time, but since rural incomes seem to be more highly skewed than
urban incomes, the increasing demographic importance of the towns and cities
would seem to present a prima facie case for presuming a modest improvement
in the overall national income distribution. This conclusion is to some
extent supported by national income accounts data which indicate that the
share of wage and salary income of GDP increased from 36 percent in 1950
to 40 percent in 1970. Few Colombians would accept past rates of improvement
as adequate, however, and a great deal remains to be done in order to spread
the benefits of economic growth more widely. Rural land redistribution,
more effective taxation, higher public spending for education and health
services, and a vigorous effort to boost overall production and employment
growth are all needed, together with continuing efforts to prevent abuses
arising from monopoly power. Colombia's authorities have accelerated their
efforts to do all of these things in recent years.



ANNEX I
Page 11 of 12
17.        The employment goal is perhaps the most important of all the major
national objectives in the economic spbere. Increasing and spreading employ-
ment opportunities is the single most effective way to raise the level and
improve the distribution of national income. Data on unemployment are sparse,
but the available figures for 1972 point to an improvement in Bogota accom-
panied by deterioration in Medellin, Barranquilla, and other urban centers.
If rough weights by city are applied, a slight overall deterioration seems
to have occurred. Since 1972 rural to urban migration appears to have
increased and as a result unemployment in Colombia's major urban centers has
increased. The one exception to this has been in Cali where accelerated
rural to urban migration has not been as pronounced because of its rich agri-
cultural hinterland and decentralized agro-industries located in a number of
smaller cities throughout the Departments of Valle and Cauca. The challenge
facing Colombia's authorities is to encourage and shape growth of employment
through the use of excise taxes, depreciation allowances, import tariffs and
general monetary/fiscal policies. Special incentives should be provided to
industries which are labour-intensive and to firms willing to undertake
multiple shifting as a means of increasing employment.
C. The Growth Perspective and Capital Requirements
18.        Recent IBRD Economic Reports on Colombia have concluded that the
economy can sustain a 7 percent annual rate of growth over the long-term
without excessive foreign borrowing, provided that exports can be increased
at a reasonable rate. During 1972-73 this growth target was attained, and
it is likely that in 1974 real growth will again reach about 7 percent. These
high rates of growth were accompanied by a strong export and balance-of-payments
performance, which made possible a large build-up of foreign exchange re-
serves, and a decline in the debt service ratio. Earlier projections now
need to be revised, to take into account recent developments and new
information on the outlook for commodity prices and world inflation.
19.       For the time being it seems safe to assume that the volume of coffee
exports will increase 1.5 percent annually from 1975 through the remainder of
the current decade and that export earnings from coffee in current prices will
increase an average 7.6 percent annually, until 1979. Growth in the volume of
other exports, which include a wide range of manufactured and agricultural
exports, can be assumed to decline from 20 percent in 1975 to 10 percent for
1979.  Thus, total exports would increase in current prices at an average 14.3 per-
eent per year from 1974 on. In real terms the growth rate of total exports may thus
be between 7 mnd 7.5 percent. Imports may be assumed to be about 15 percent of GDP
throughout the projection period provided that Colombia will not require sub-
stantial imports of crude oil. Under these assumptions Colombia will require
public external assistance disbursements totalling about US$3.5 billion during
the five-year period 1975-79. This level of external assistance implies new
commitments averaging US$700 million annually. These public external assistance
requirements imply only modest increases in real terms over recent levels.



ANNEX I
Page 12 of 12
20.       In the past the structure of Colombia's external debt has been
strongly influenced by the receipt of large amounts of development assistance
from international development agencies. This, together with the successful
export performance, explains the low and relatively stable debt service
ratio which Colombia has experienced over the past decade. As a result
of continuing rapid growth of non-traditional exports and favorable coffee
prices, the burden of debt service on the balance of payments declined
moderately in 1973. The debt service ratio (principal and interest pay-
ments as a percentage of exports of goods and nonfactor services) amounted
to a modest 12 percent in 1973 compared to 12.9 percent in 1972 and 14.3 per-
cent in 1971. The debt service ratio is now lower than throughout most of
the 1960s. Despite the expected shift away from external assistance from
international development agencies and the large increase in total external
borrowing (in current prices) which is foreseen at least until the end of
the current decade, the debt service ratio could be kept within manageable
limits during that period provided the Government prudently manages aggregate
demand for imports and avoids external borrowing on unfavorable terms to
cover fiscal shortfalls. On that condition, and assuming that Colombia is
able to sustain its export expansion, the country should have little difficulty
in obtaining the required external capital and in servicing its external debt
obligations. However, some of this capital will have to finance local costs,
if the country is to cover its justifiable resource gap, since the foreign
exchange content of the projectizable portion of the investment program is
likely to be comparatively small.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION &
1.        Summarized below is the current status of all loans signed but not
fully disbursed:
Ln No. 502 Irrigation (Atlantico I); US$9 million, June 1967.
Closing date: original - December 31, 1972;
current - December 31, 1974.
2.        While physical works are almost completed, final payments to con-
tractors will not occur until September 1975. A further extension of
closing date to December 31, 1975, is therefore being considered. The delays
in project execution have been occasioned by poor selection of areas suitable
for irrigation, technical problems in the construction of irrigation and
drainage works, and non-compliance by contractors with established schedules.
Agricultural development has also been slow, due to poor project management
and lack of adequate supporting services to the fanmer. However, INCORA has
now appointed a very capable Project Manager who has brought with him a
competent agricultural team who, it is believed, have the potential to
develop the project satisfactorily under its less than ideal circumstances.
Citrus has now been abandoned as a project crop. Rice is now proposed as a
temporary irrigated crop in order to allow the leaching of salts from the

Closing date: original - June 30, 1972;
current - December 31, 1975.
3.        As of March 31, 1975, US$13.7 million or 98 percent of this loan
has been disbursed. Notwithstanding that the Project is essentially completed,
the Closing Date 8as extended because of delays in procurement and to permit
final payments to suppliers.
Ln No. 575 Electric Power (Interconnection); US$18 million, December 1968.
Closing date: original - February 29, 1972;
current - December 31, 1974.
4.        The original project was completed and commercially operational in
1971. The Bank agreed that an undisbursed balance could be used to finance a
220kv transmission line, Guatape - Barrancabermeja, which would be completed
in the first quarter of 1975, one year behind schedule. The cost of the line
is estimated at US$7.2 million of which about US$4.1 million represents the
foreign component. Because the shareholders have not made their financial
contribution to ISA when due, ISA has not been able to pay its contractors
on time. Another problem facing ISA is the present ownership of its capital
stock, which permits three of the four shareholders holding individually

more than 25 percent of the shares to block any resolution requiring a 75 per-
cent majority. Following discussions with the Borrower and the Government,
ISA's financial situation has improved somewhat but the Bank is continuing
to keep it under intensive review. The Borrower has not submitted any
requests for wfthdrawals from the Bank Loan since October 1974L.
Ln No. 624 Agricultural Credit II; US$17 million, June 1969.
Closing date: original - December 31, 1973;
current - June 30, 1975.
5.        After disappointing performance in the first three years, changes in
project management and organization and an increase in technical personnel
provided the basis in February 1973 for the Bank's agreement to enlarge the
project area awd include lending to small farmers under the project. As a
result, the project is now proceeding in a satisfactory manner. Almost all
project funds have now been committed, and disbursements should be completed
by the Closing Date.
Ln No. 651 Livestock II; US$18.3 million, December 1969.
Closing date: July 31, 1975.
6.        After a disappointing performance during the first three years after
signing, 1970-'72, CAJA's project administration was reorganized and the project
area was extended to cover the entire country. The project has, since early
1973, progress3d satisfactorily. Demand for on-farm investments is high and
disbursements 'have been accelerating. All loan funds have now been comLitted,
and disbursements might be completed before the original closing date of
July 31, 1975.
Ln No. 679 Education II; US$6.5 million, June 1970.
Closing date: original - June 30, 1973;
current - July 31, 1975.
7.        Major civil works have been completed and all nine project schools
have been in operation since January 1973. However, operation of schools is
below the expected level because of inadequate organization and shortage of
local funds to meet current expenditures. Procurement of equipment and
furniture has been delayed. A third postponement of the closing date tD
July 31, 1975,was made to permit payments to be made for expenditures
arising from contracts awarded under this project by December 31, 1 974.
Ln No. 680 Highway VI; US$32 million, June 1970.
Closing date: original - November 30, 1974;
current - November 30, 1976.
8.        The largest component of the project, the paving program, has ex-
perienced conEiderable cost increases and is still experiencing delays. The
Ministry of PLublic Works has taken many steps (supported by the Bank) which
have reduced, although not avoided, delays and contractor bankruptcies. Due
to cost increases, the Bank's participation in the paving program has been
reduced to 15 percent. The status of the other components of the project is
more satisfactory.

Ln No. 681 Chivor Hydroelectric Power; US$52.3 million, June 1970.
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
9.        The first generating unit for the Chivor Hydroelectric Project is
expected to be put into service in mid-1976, a year behind schedule. The
project's foreign and total costs are expected to be 35 percent higher than
originally estimated. Because the shareholders have not made their financial
contribution to ISA when due, ISA has not been able to pay its contractors
on time. Another problem facing ISA is the present ownership of its capital
stock, which permits three of the four shareholders holding individually
more than 25 percent of the shares to block any resolution requiring a 75
percent majority. Following discussions with the Borrower and the Government,
ISA's financial situation has improved somewhat but the Bank is continuing to
keep it under intensive review. The Borrower has not submitted any requests
for withdrawals from the Bank loan since October 1974.
Ln No. 682 Cali Water Supply and Sewerage; US$18.5 million, June 1970.
Closing date: original - June 30, 1974;
current - December 31, 1975.
10.       As of March 31, 1975, about 58 percent of the loan amount was
disbursed. Disbursements were delayed due to a late project start, but the
entire project is now under execution, and it is expected that oonstruction
activities will be finished by mid-1976 which would require a further extension
of the Closing Date.
Ln No. 738 Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage; US$2 million, May 1971.
Closing date: original - March 1, 1975;
current - March 1, 1976.
11.       As of March 31, 1975, about 50 percent of the loan amount was
disbursed. Disbursements were delayed due to initial management and fiscal
problems. A financial crisis in early 1973 has now been resolved through
higher tariffs and tight budget control. Construction is expected to be
terminated in late 1975.
Ln No. 739 Land Settlement Caqueta I; US$8.1 million, May 1971.
Closing date: April 30, 1975.
12.       Because of considerable price increases and unexpectedly difficult
physical problems, project objectives were reduced to about 70 percent of
appraisal targets in August 1973, halfway through the project period. Since
then, the livestock credit program has picked up speed so that the revised
goal for this component should be achieved ahead of time. On the other hand,
the road construction program has fallen far behind schedule although it
is now proceeding at an accelerated pace. Despite these problems, the
project is making a substantial contribution to the successful colonization
of the Caqueta area, and a postponement of the Closing Date is therefore
planned.

Ln No. 740 Telecommunications II; US$15 million, May 1971.
Closing date: June 30, 1975.
13.       Contracts for all Bank-financed goods have been signed; however,
due to initial delays in the procurement of project equipment, a slippage of
up to 18 months in the completion date of some works on the project is now
anticipated.
Ln No. 741 Water Supply (Bogota II); US$88 million, May 1971.
Closing date: June 30, 1978.
14.       Disbursements up to March 31, 1975 amounted to 21 percent of this
loan, only 40 percent of the appraisal estimate. Slow progress in the con-
struction of the vital Palacio - Rio Blanco Tunnel - is the main reason for
the project's delay; the previous foreign contractor has been replaced by
another firm. EAAB's financial situation was weak, but important measures
to improve it have been taken by the Empresa.
Ln No. 742 Development Finance Companies IV: US$40 million, May 1971.
Closing date: original - December 31, 1974;
current - December 31, 1975.
15.       This loan is fully committed. Disbursements are ahead of schedule.
Ln No. 842 Development Program and Export Expansion Project; US$60 million,
June 1972.
Closing date: original - December 31, 1974;
current - December 31, 1975.
16.       The US$10 million DF  portion of this program loan is now almost
fully committed. The last subproject which will utilize the unallocated
balance of the loan (US$943,000) is now under review. Disbursements are
proceeding satisfactorily.
Ln No. 849 Irrigation (Atlantico II), US$5 million, June 1972.
Closing date: March 31, 1978.
17.       Construction of drainage facilities is lagging far behind schedule
primarily due to the poor performance of the contractor having the major
responsibility for the drain construction financed under this loan. Steps
are being taken to either force compliance with the contract or replace the
contractor with another. It now appears that more of the project area will
be devoted to combination cattle feeding and milk production than was previously
envisaged. The returns per ha from such enterprises will not differ too much
from the field crops originally contemplated.
Ln No. 860 Medium-Size Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$9.1 million,
October 1972.
Closing date: September 30, 1976.
18.       As of March 31, 1975, about 16 percent of the loan amount was
disbursed. Disbursements were delayed due to initial serious management
problems. But about 50 percent of scheduled works have by now been completed
and the remainder are expected to be completed in 1976.

Ln No. 874 Guatape II Hydroelectric Power Project; US$56 million, January 1973.
Closing date: December 31, 1978.
19.       The progress of the work is generally satisfactory except for delays
in the resettlement of El Penol and Guatape villages, which means that filling
the Santa Rita reservoir cannot be started before mid-1977, two years behind
schedule. This would be likely to lead to an energy deficit in the inter-
connected system of at least 10 percent from 1978 to 1981. The revised project
cost estimate (US$119.2 million) is 21.3 percent above appraisal estimates,
mainly due to higher costs of the works at El Penol and Guatape. EPM has
failed to achieve the 9 percent rate of return required under the Loan Agree-
ment and it has fallen behind in its payments to ISA, thus contributing to
the problems experienced by the latter (see Loan 681). The Bank has been
seriously concerned about EPM's financial situation. However, a recent
substantial increase in EPM's electricity tariffs has led to some improvement
in the financial situation which the Bank is continuing to keep under intensive
review. The Borrower has not submitted any requests for withdrawals from the
Bank loan since October 197T.
Ln No. 903 Development Finance Companies V; US$60 million, May 1973.
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
20.       Commitments of the loan were interrupted for several months last
year pending agreement on a revised interest rate. Commitments are now
proceeding well, and it is expected that the balance of US$8.4 million
unallocated at March 31, 1975, will be fully committed soon. Currently,
loan applications pending approval exceed the unallocated funds available.
Disbursements are still behind schedule, but in view of the rapid rate of
commitment, they should be completed by the Closing Date.
Ln No. 920 Education III; US$21.2 million, July 1973.
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
21.       Thls loan became effective on January 9, 1974. Shortage of counter-
part funds delayed to September 1974 the opening of construction bids for the
first 22 project institutions. Construction work is therefore one year behind
schedule, but is proceeding smoothly. Procurement of teaching equipment has
been progressing satisfactorily and 40 percent of the purchase orders are being
processed. Implementation of the technical teacher training program and the
various studies for the sector analysis have not moved forward, and the Bank
has informed the Government that prompt action is necessary.
Ln No. 926 Sixth Railway Project; US$25 million, August 1973.
Closing date: June 30, 1976.
22.       Implementation of CNR's Investment Plan is progressing satisfactorily;
track rehabilitation and maintenance, together with workshop production, con-
tinue to improve. Project objectives probably will have to be reduced by 35
percent because of the large increase in the price of materials. CNR's
financial picture has continued to improve because of increased traffic and
tariffs. However, the Government's recent emergency program, which intends
to halt imports of wheat, will have a serious adverse impact on that traffic
between Santa Marta and Bogota.

ments have been made under the loan, and the Bogota office is currently having
discussions with the Borrower (FUNADE) regarding utilization of the loan.
Ln No. 1071 Small-Scale Industry; US$5.5 million, January 1975.
Closing date: December 31, 1977.
24.       The loan has not yet been declared effective. An additional 30-day
period has been granted at the request of the Borrower to enable the bene-
ficiary institution, the Corporacion Financiera Pbpular, to comply with the
remaining condition of effectiveness: the contracting of a consulting firm
to study CFP's organizational structure.

CAQUETA RURAL SETTLEMENT PROJECT (Phase II)
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                 Republic of Colombia
Beneficiary:              Instituto Colombiano de la Reforma Agraria
(INCORA)
Amount:                   US$19.5 million equivalent
Terms:                    20 years, including 4 years' grace at
8-1/2 percent interest.
Relending Terms:     (a)  The Borrower would onlend US$7.3 million of the loan
proceeds to INCORA in support of credit programs
for small farmers, for 20 years, without interest.
The Borrower would assume the foreign exchange
risk. The remainder of the loan proceeds would
be made available by the Borrower to INCORA and
participating agencies as grants.
(b) For farm development credit, ICORA would onlend
to Banco Ganadero at nine percent interest, with
Banco Ganadero assuming the credit risk. Sub-loans
from Banco Ganadero to participating farmers would
have terms up to 12 years, including three years'
grace during which interest would be capitalized,
and would bear interest at 15 percent per annum.
The loan from INCORA to Banco Ganadero would be
repaid under an amortization schedule substantially
reflecting the aggregate of the amortization
scheduleof the long-term loans made by Banco
Ganadero, including three years' grace for capital
and interest.
(c) For cattle-fattening, INCORA would onlend to
COOPERAGRO at 18-20 percent interest. COOPERAGRO
would place the proceeds in a revolving fund to be
used for purchasing animals for fattening by its
members. The animals would be sold under COOPERAGRO's
supervision after 20 months, with the individual
farmer receiving 60 percent of the gross profit.
COOPERAGRO would repay INCORA in two iLnstallments
at the end of the 20th and 40th months. INCORA
would reinvest in the revolving fund as required to
maintain the fund's value. Alternatively, INCORA
could lend directly to individual farmers at
20 percent interest per annum.

ProJect Description:      The project is the continuation of the ongoing
Caqueta Land Colonization Project and would be
developed over a four-year period. It differs
from the first project in that emphasis would be
placed on follow-up assistance to established farms,
environmental protection, and social services. An
estimated 2,850 small farmers would receive medium-
and long-term credit in Phase II, and the addi-
tional economic and social infrastructure would
benefit a large proportion of the overall popula-
tion of the region, which has grown to 12,000
families.

Procurement Arrangements:  Procurement procedures in Phase II would be
similar to those under Phase I. Road construc-
tion and road maintenance equipment would be
procured through international competitive
bidding. School construction and all other
construction, equipment, and services would be
procured under local bidding procedures.
Consultants:               INCORA would employ engineering consultants,
acceptable to the Bank, to assist in analyzing
bids and supervising road construction.
Rate of Return:            The economic rate of return is estimated at
13.8 percent, excluding the benefits and costs
for the education and health program, anid
excluding benefits from the forestry and erosion
control components.
