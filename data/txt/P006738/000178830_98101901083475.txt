SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the second phase of the Caqueta Land Coloniz-
ation Project in the Amazon basin. The Bank made a loan of US$8.1 million
in 1971 (Loan 739-CO) to help finance the first phase. In addition to settling
population from densely populated areas, the project would help increase live-
stock production by small farmers, supporting the "Plan Bovino" carried out
by the Ministry of Agriculture as part of its effort to diversify Colombian
agriculture away from coffee, and improve income distribution.
ii.       Over the last eight years, the Bank has made five loans for agricul-
tural development in Colombia, totaling US$57.4 million (for one colonization,
two credit and two irrigation and drainage projects). All projects underwent
initial difficulties, but at present overall performance is considered to be
generally satisfactory although the irrigation and drainage projects continue
to suffer from poor soil conditions.
iii.      The Caqueta Land Colonization Project (Phase I), to be developed
over a three-year investment period, comprises mainly -- for 89% of project
costs -- farm development credit and road construction. The remaining 11%
is for social infrastructure and project administration costs. Despite
considerable price increases in all project components and unexpectedly dif-
ficult physical conditions, affecting particularly road construction, progress
has been good. At the current rate of progress, the loan is scheduled to be
disbursed by April 1976, or one year behind schedule.
iv.       The Phase II project would be developed over a four-year period
and consists of credit, mainly for breeding and fattening cattle; land clear-
ing and pasture establishment; construction of about 200 km of penetration
roads and complementary road-works; improvement of social services; a forestry
and erosion control program; farmers technical assistance; and project admini-
stration. The project credit program would directly benefit 2,850 farmers,
while infrastructure and supporting services would indirectly benefit a large
proportion of the 12,000 settler families living in the project area.
v.        Estimated total project costs are US$37.1 million, of which 22% or
US$8.1 million, would be foreign exchange. Excluding expenditures for farm
credit and labor, project costs amount to US$19.5 million, of which 38%, or
US$7.5 million, is foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan of US$19.5 mil-
lion, or 53% of total project costs, would cover the foreign exchange com-
ponent and US$11.4 million of local investment cost or 39% of total local
costs.
vi.       Procurement would be through international bidding procedures
in accordance with Bank guidelines for road construction contracts and road
maintenance equipment estimated at US$8.7 million. Other contracts for goods
and services would be procured through local competitive bidding procedures,
which are satisfactory to the Bank.
vii.      The project would be administered by INCORA, which would continue to
be assisted by appropriate Government agencies in executing several specialized



- ii -
project components. The new Government which took office in August 1974 plans
to review INCORA's organizational structure, and the final project organiza-
tion and management proposals would be adjusted if considerable changes of
INCORA are introduced.
viii.     Long-term credit, mainly for purchase of breeding cattle, would
continue to be issued through Banco Ganadero according to satisfactory pro-
cedures used under Phase I. Banco Ganadero and INCORA jointly have the
responsibility for elaborating farm plans and supervising the credit. Banco
Ganadero takes the credit risk. Farmers' repayment period would be 12 years,
with a three-year grace period. The annual interest would be 15%, with
capitalization of interest over the grace period. This interest rate is based
on the general level of interest rates applied to agricultural credit, which
is largely regulated by Government. Under current rates of inflation, these
interest rates are negative in real terms. The recommended rate would be
more than double the rate paid under the Phase I project and equal to interest
paid under other credit schemes by large ranchers in the area and thus, would
be acceptable to the Bank. The proposed terms would be subject to revision if
Government regulations on credit to the agricultural sector are changed.
ix.       Project beneficiaries would have farms of between 30 and 200 ha
and receive one or two loans for up to a total of 25 head of cattle. The
average beneficiary is expected to increase his annual net income per capita,
after about 20 years, from the present level of about US$70 to between US$250
and US$550 in terms of 1974 currency. These incomes compare with a per capita
income in Colombia of US$210 in the rural areas and US$530 in the urban areas
and an estimated US$180 as the upper limit for the lower 40% of total popula-
tion.
X.        The economic rate of return of the project over its 23-year life
is estimated at 14%. Under none of the alternatives considered, which include
either cost increases or benefit reductions of 20%, does the rate of return
fall below 10%. These rates are estimated excluding the costs of social
services, which correspond to 5% of project costs and for which corresponding
benefits are not quantifiable.
xi.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$19.5 million for 20
years, including four years of grace. Government would be the borrower and
assume the foreign exchange risk.



COLOMBIA
CAQUETA RURAL SETTLEMENT PROJECT (PHASE II)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Colombia, through its Institute of Agrarian
Reform (INCORA), has requested a loan to assist in financing the second
stage of the Caqueta Land Colonization Project in the Caqueta Intendencia
of the Amazon Province. The Bank has made five loans for agricultural
development in Colombia in the last eight years, totaling US$57.4 million.
After slow starts, these projects are now performing satisfactorily (Annex
1). The proposed project was prepared by INCORA with the assistance of
PIDELTA, a Colombian consultant firm.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      During the 1965-70 period, GDP grew by 5.8% p.a. and over the last
two years by 7% p.a. During the same two periods, agricultural production,
which accounted in 1972 for 25% of GDP, grew by 4.5 and 5.5%, respectively,
permitting more domestic consumption as well as increased exports of agri-
cultural products. Long-term prospects are that the 5.5% growth in agri-
cultural production will continue as productivity increases and more land
is brought into use.
2.02      Population, about 23 million in 1972, grows by an estimated 3.2%
annually. About 1.5 million agricultural families, or 43% of the economical-
ly active, live in rural areas where there are employment opportunities for
about 60% of available manpower. Of these rural families, an estimated
200,000 are landless. Population density is uneven, with only 3% of the
people living on 67% of the national territory formed by the plains located
east of the Andes.
2.03      Annual income per capita is estimated at about US$210 in the rural
areas and US$530 in the urban areas. An estimated 40% of the population earns
less than US$180 per capita. Not only is rural income lower than urban income,
but its distribution is more skewed: 10% of the farmer population obtains 50%
of the total rural income, while this proportion is about 40% in the urban
areas. Many farmers in the more densely populated areas live at bare subsis-
tence level.
2.04      Colombia's efforts to diversify its agriculture from coffee have
been successful: in 1972, coffee contributed 70% of agricultural export



-2 -
values as compared to 78% in 1969. Among other agricultural exports, livestock
products showed the most significant growth, rising from US$20 million, or
5.4% in 1969 to US$57 million, or 10% of agricultural exports 1/, in 1972.
Annual livestock production is estimated to have had a net growth over the
last 12 years of 5.14% while the extraction rate increased progressively from
11.5% in the 1950-55 period to 14.6% in the 1967-72 period.   In July 1973,
the Ministry of Agriculture initiated a livestock development plan ("Plan
Bovino"), the objectives of which are to increase production, create a better
income distribution among cattle raisers and make possible a higher per capita
consumption of milk and beef, while continuing to increase exports.
B. Banking and Credit
2.05      In 1972, the agricultural credit portfolio totaled about US$400
million, or 25% of all outstanding loans. This portfolio was distributed as
follows: Caja de Credito Agrario Industrial y Minero (Caja Agraria), 47%;
Banco Ganadero, 11%; the other commercial banks, 25%; INCORA, 7%; and others,
10%. Banking and agricultural credit in Colombia and specifically in the
Caqueta area is discussed in Annex 2.
2.06      The Colombian banking system is characterized by a high degree
of Government intervention as reflected by a complex set of regulations on
interest rates and compulsory investment regimes administered by a Monetary
Board, on which the Minister of Agriculture sits as a member. As a result
of the high inflation rates and low interest rates applied in the Government-
controlled market, mobilization of funds by credit institutions is being
made difficult, thus affecting the supply of funds for agricultural lending.
Law 5, passed in March 1973, is expected to offset this scarcity, by requir-
ing commercial banks to invest 15% of their placements in 8% agrarian bonds
issued by the Central Bank. These funds are then relent through rediscount
facilities to all credit institutions for agricultural lending (Annex 2,
paras 9 and 10).
2.07      In September 1974, the Monetary Board issued a resolution fixing the
annual interest rate on loans for agricultural and livestock breeding redis-
counted with Government funds at 15% and for cattle fattening at 20%. An
additional 1%0 is charged to commercial farmers as a contribution to a tech-
nical assistance fund for small farmers. This resolution replaced a highly
variable and complex set of interest rates, which ranged from 14% for large
commercial farmers to 6-1/4% for small farmers. Additionally, all banks
1/   Include hides and skins, beef and live animals for 310,000 head equiva-
lent. These official statistics do not include the estimated 200,000
head annually smuggled into Venezuela, where beef prices are higher.

insist that farmers carry insurance policies covering life and permanent dis-
ability, the premium being 1% a year on the loan balance outstanding. At the
current rates of inflation (22% in 1973), all institutional credit to agri-
culture bears negative real interest rates.
2.08      The increased interest rates that credit institutions will have to
pay to mobilize funds on the financial market as a result of inflation and
the narrow spread of 1% to 3% on Law 5 funds has serious implications for small
farmer lending in Colombia. Credit institutions will tend to compensate their
increased financial costs by reducing their administration expenses through
making larger size loans. Thus, if present low interest rates are maintained
and high inflation persists, small farmer lendings will depend more than ever
on special programs.
C. Instituto Colombiano de la Reforma Agraria (INCORA)
2.09      INCORA was established in 1961 to reform the agrarian social struc-
ture of Colombia and bring about a fairer distribution of land and income
among the rural population. In addition to acquiring unutilized land and
redistributing it to landless peasants, INCORA was also assigned to handle a
wide range of activities, including land titling, technical assistance, irri-
gation and drainage, colonization, and credit to assist land reform benefici-
aries in developing their newly acquired holdings. In 1973, INCORA adminis-
tered 35 projects: 13 for irrigation and drainage, 12 for colonization, and
10 for general agriculture and credit. These groups accounted respectively
for 55%, 20% and 25% of INCORA project expenditures, which amounted to
Col$ 2.5 billion in 1973.
2.10      INCORA's performance has been subject to considerable criticism,
mainly because its social achievements have fallen considerably short of
objectives, but its contribution to agricultural development has been sub-
stantial despite insufficient Government support. With only 374,000 ha ac-
quired and 190,000 ha redistributed to 11,300 families (representing 1.4% of
the 800,000 families eligible to receive land), the agrarian reform program
did not meet expectations mainly because of legal interference by powerful
landlords in the acquisition of more land and lack of financial support to
develop what had been acquired. In its 16 irrigation and drainage districts,
it has settled 4,000 families out of the total of 26,000 projected, but many
of these districts are only in the initial stage of development, as progress
has been delayed because of lack of resources. On the other hand, INCORA has
issued titles for 135,000 farms, totaling 3.8 million ha, located in virgin
public land. Under its colonization projects, involving about 120,000 rural
families, about 700 km of roads have been constructed, as well as schools and
health facilities. In all its projects combined, INCORA has channelled a
total of Col$ 1.3 billion (US$51 million) in credit to 55,000 families.



-4-
INCORA's delivery costs and overdues to loans outstanding are acceptable,
considering the social and development characteristics of INCORA's lending
program (Annex 3).
2.11      INCORA's existing organizational structure consists of four func-
tional departments (legal, administrative, engineering and agricultural
development) and six regional and 25 project offices. Managers of irrigation
and drainage, and agricultural and credit projects are responsible to INCORA's
General Manager through project coordinators rather than through the heads of
the functional departments. This structure is not conducive to operational
efficiency: the main departments are not directly responsible for project
implementation and too little authority is vested in the project managers.
The Colonization Division within the Engineering Department has somehow avoided
these difficulties, however, partly because colonization project managers re-
spond directly to the chief of the division. The new Government which took
office in August 1974 has declared its intention to have INCORA reorganized.
2.12      INCORA's income from operations is inadequate to cover its current
expenditures, which reflects Government's use of INCORA as a channel for pro-
viding government services. According to INCORA's budgetary accounting state-
ments, its net deficit amounted in 1972 to Col$ 165 million, or 3% of total
assets, which amounted to Col$ 5.8 billion in 1972 (Annex 3, Table 8).  Govern-
ment transfers are used in part to cover these deficits.
III. THE CAQUETA COLONIZATION PROGRAM
A. The Area
Location and Physical Features
3.01      The project areas of Phases I and II are the same and consist of
1.2 million ha in the Intendencia of Caqueta in south Colombia, forming a strip
70 to 100 km wide, including the foothills of the Andean Cordillera, centered
on Florencia, and the lowlands stretching southeastward toward the Amazon
basin, between the Caqueta river in the south and the Caguan river in the
northeast (Map 11000).
3.02      The climate is humid and tropical, temperatures remain around 25°C
all year and rainfall varies between 2 and 4 m annually, with a dry period
between December and February. Soils are predominantly deep clay with high
acidity and low fertility and not considered suitable for continuous annual
cropping, but good for permanent pasture. Topography is rolling. The area
is crossed by numerous permanent rivers, and groundwater is usually found
at a depth of 4 m.



3.03      Natural vegetation is a tropical humid forest having only a few
species with commercial value. Erosion is as yet not a critical problem but
measures would be taken to prevent exessive settlement in the Cordillera hills,
reduce overgrazing in the foothills, and provide for some forest cover to be
retained in the lowlands before erosion becomes uncontrollable (Annex 4).
Transportation
3.04      Caqueta is accessible to the rest of the country mainly through a
100-km mountainous road from Garzon to Florencia. Pavement and enlargement
of this road is planned to be started in 1975. Several flights per week also
link Bogota to Florencia. Within the project area, a main access road
(Carretera Marginal de la Selva) runs along the foothills from San Jose to
Puerto Rico, but lack of a bridge over the Caguan River and 15 km of road
prevents linkage with San Vicente, the center of the main cattle area within
Caqueta. Penetration roads outward from this main access road are being
constructed under ongoing programs at satisfactory standards, but more roads
are required to replace ongoing transport of settlers' production from the
frontier to markets by river or on muleback.
The Colonization Movement and Population
3.05      Colonization started in Caqueta during the rubber boom early in
this century. In the late 1930's, large numbers of settlers began to move to
the area as word spread that they could take possession of public land and
that the area was particularly well suited for livestock. Government support
to the colonization movement started in 1959 with a directed settlement scheme
organized by Caja Agraria, but this was not successful because of poor selec-
tion of settlers and inadequate supervision of credit beneficiaries. INCORA
was then made responsible for the Government's colonization programs in
1964. By supporting mainly spontaneous settlers, it avoided the selection
problem, and credit was provided through the USAID-financed supervised credit
program (Annex 2). Population increased from 153,000 in 1969 to 180,000 in
1972 and is now growing at a rate of about 5.5% per year: about 3.5% by
natural growth and the rest through immigration, mainly from the overpopulated
departments of Antioquia and Huila, but also from urban centers (20%), where
migrators accumulated funds to purchase a farm. About 77% of total population
is rural.
Indian Tribes
3.06      Of the 3,500 indigenes surveyed in the project area in 1951, only
about 2,500, living dispersed in numerous tribes, remain in Caqueta today.
While some indigenes have been fully integrated among the settler population,
others have either moved downstream to less accessible areas or are trying to
continue their tribal existence in the area despite the progressive invasion
of some of their land by unscrupulous settlers. Although it is recognized
that the problem would exist whether or not INCORA supported the colonization
movemenant in Caqueta, INCORA has pledged to support the Office of Indian
Affairs in its efforts to implement a Joint study (1974), which recommends
that (a) the Indian lands be surveyed and officially declared reserved for



-6-
indigenous populations, and (b) the possibilities to socially and economically
integrate these populations in the development process be investigated. Im-
plementation of these recommendations has started and, during negotiations,
Government has declared its intentions to strictly apply in the area the
national regulations concerning Indian populations.
Land Tenure
3.07      The average farm size for the 12,000 farms in the area is about 80
ha, with 75% of the farmers occupying farms that are of sufficient size (30
ha or more) to be economically viable for livestock (Annex 5). Since 1964,
INCORA has issued about 10,000 titles in the area for farms averaging 50 ha.
Agricultural Development
3.08      Since livestock was introduced in Caqueta (in 1934), about 500,000
ha of forest have been cleared, and, after a first year under maize or rice,
transformed into pasture. There are about 450,000 head in Caqueta and the
herd is growing at a rate of 7% per year (excluding 1% through introduction
of cattle during the first two years of the Phase I project), with an extrac-
tion rate of 16.4% (6.3% for local consumption and 10.1% for outside Caqueta).
Livestock has become Caqueta's main product and a slaughterhouse will be con-
structed as soon as the Garzon-Florencia road has been improved enough to
permit the passage of large refrigerated trucks. Other important commodities
are maize, rice, plantain and pigs.
Agricultural Supporting Services
3.09      All agricultural credit institutions are represented in Caqueta,
with combined outstanding agricultural credit amounting in 1973 to Col$ 334
million (Annex 2, Table 8). Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario (ICA) operates
a demonstration center for animal husbandry and pasture management at Macagual.
Although ICA, INCORA, and credit institutions provide some sort of farmers'
technical assistance, mainly to credit beneficiaries, their services are insuf-
ficiently staffed and poorly coordinated and therefore remain inefficient.
Social Services
3.10      Social services, particularly education and health, are notably
inadequate in the area. Structures such as schools and health centers per
inhabitant are below national averages for rural areas, and, with the popu-
lation under 12 years old in Caqueta growing at the rate of 5,000 to 6,000
per year, more new facilities are required than the national budget allows
for. Additionally, education services are generally poor: teachers have
inadequate training and teaching materials are in short supply. Health
hazards are also severe, particularly for children: 64% of deaths are of
children less than 15 years old and 50% are those under four years of age.
The main diseases are caused by poor nutrition and lung and gastric infesta-
tions that result mostly from unsanitary living conditions.

B. The Cagueta Land Colonization Project (Phase I)
3.11      In 1971, the Bank made a loan of US$8.1 million to Colombia for the
first Caqueta Project (Loan 739-CO). The project was to be developed over
three years and is administered by INCORA. It was to benefit the 8,000 set-
tlers' families living in the area and provide for the first of three succes-
sive long-term livestock loans to 4,500 settlers, construction of 380 km of
roads, 90 primary schools and six health centers, and improvement of INCORA's
local administration. Total costs were estimated at Col$ 388.4 million
(US$21.6 million), 1/ including US$0.8 million for contingencies.
3.12      In addition to the usual start-up problems, the project has suffered
from: (a) considerable price increases in all fields, (b) unexpectedly dif-
ficult physical conditions affecting particularly the road construction pro-
gram and (c) the lack of participation by settlers in constructing schools
under self-help programs. Credit in the area prior to project initiation was
so short that several farmers had sufficient land already under pasture to
receive at once the equivalent of the three projected loans for a total of
17 head of cattle on average. It also appeared that, to prevent farmers from
selling too young calves, they would have to be given financial assistance so
that they could defer sales and keep the animals until they had been fattened
and could be sold at a more profitable price. These observations led to an
adjustment of proAect objectives, which were set as follows: 1,800 long-term
agricultural loans, 270 cattle fattening loans, construction of about 200 km of
roads, 60 primary schools, six health centers and strengthening of INCORA's
local administration. Total revised costs are estimated at Col$ 473.4 million
(US$19.3 million). 2/
3.13      On April 15, 1975, US$7.1 million (88%) of the loan had been dis-
bursed, and, with all remaining contracts being signed, the project is ex-
pected to be completed by April 1976. Taking into account the difficulties
encountered, performance under the Phase I project is considered to be good
and its contribution to the colonization of the area is highly appreciated by
Government officials and project beneficiaries. It is premature to observe
an improvement of beneficiaries' income, but the possession of a basic herd
has given participants the hope of being able to maintain themselves on their
current holdings (averaging 85 ha), thus stabilizing the land tenure system
in the area. By importing 60% of the breeding cattle into Caqueta, mainly
from the Atlantic coast, the project has also markedly increased the economic
1/   Exchange rate in 1971 was US$1 - Col$ 18.0.
2/   At an average exchange rate of US$1 - Col$ 24.5.

development prospects of an area destined to play a major role in the Govern-
ment's efforts to develop its livestock production. The revised rate of re-
turn of the project is estimated at 15.0% (para 8.05), as compared with the
appraisal estimate of 16.5%. The outstanding problems are the lack of tech-
nical assistance to farmers, for which no explicit allowance had been made,
and the inadequacy of road maintenance under responsibility of Fondo Nacional
de Caminos Vecinales (Caminos Vecinales), an agency within the Ministry of
Public Works. The provision of schools and health buildings also failed to
have the projected impact on the education and health conditions in the area
because inadequate programs did not make full use of the new facilities.
These deficiencies would be taken care of in the proposed Phase II project.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The project, a continuation of the ongoing Caqueta Land Colonization
Project, would assist the settlement of 2,850 farms and provide infrastructural
support to a large proportion of the 12,000 settler families in the area. The
project would be developed over a four-year period and consist of: farm devel-
opment, comprising clearing land now under forest and establishing pasture,
and long-term credit, mainly for purchase of breeding cattle (70% to 80%) and
other basic farm investments (30% to 20%); credit for cattle fattening; road
construction and complementary works; forestry and erosion control; education
and health programs; technical assistance to farmers; and strengthening of
project administration.
4.02      The project would be administered by INCORA, which would be assisted
by appropriate Government agencies in executing several specialized project
components (paras 6.04 and 6.05). Long-term farm credit would be channelled
through Banco Ganadero.
4.03      The project development schedule would be as shown in the following
table:

B. Detailed Features
Long-term Farm Credit
4.04      About 2,850 settlers with holdings ranging from 30 to 200 ha would
receive long-term loans under the project. Some 350 among these settlers
would have had a first loan under the Phase I project and another 350 would



- 10 -
receive two loans under the Phase II project. Initial loans would have
ceilings of 10 or 15 breeding cows and one bull, according to farm size.
Second loans would not exceed 10 head, and loans to settlers who already owned
cattle would cover only the number needed to bring the total herd number to
25. On the average, cattle would make up 70 to 80% of the loan amount. The
rest would go for fencing, pasture seeds, animal drugs, basic supplies for
farm constructions, and, in some cases, for hired labor for land clearing.
Loans would be in kind and cover 100% of the cattle and supply costs. Farmers
would contribute labor and materials (mainly wood) available on the farm (para
5.03).
Cattle Fattening Program
4.05      The revolving fund started under the Phase I project for the cattle
fattening program would be expanded under Phase II. The program consists of
purchasing two-year-old animals for farmers who fatten the animals on their
own farm during about 20 months. INCORA would either make loans directly to
farmers (para 5.05) or lend to Cooperativa Agropecuaria del Caqueta Ltda.
(COOPERAGRO) for onlending to its members. COOPERAGRO members can sell their
fattened animals only under COOPERAGRO's supervision, with 60% of the gross
margin (sa'les pri4ce less purchase price) going to the farmer. The remaining
40% is retained by the cooperative: 35% covers costs of the cooperative, and
5% is deposited in the farmers' capital account. The combined revolving fund
would provide the capital needed to make about 200 loans a year, averaging 15
head each.
Road Construction
4.06      About 200 km of roads would be constructed to continue those started
under the Phase I project. The construction schedule, calling for completion
of an average of 50 km per year, corresponds to performance under the Phase
I project during the 1973/74 period. A consulting firm or specialized agency
would handle design and supervision. Road standards would be the same as those
for Phase I roads except that cuts and embankments would be designed with
gentler slopes and protected, possibly with a local grass, to prevent erosion
(Annex 6). During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government that
anti-erosion measures (Annexes 4 and 6) would be taken to protect project
roads.
q        tm arymn!  Road-Works
4.07      Because of the difficulties encountered in constructing roads in
the heavy forest and the continuous passage on terminated road trunks of heavy
construction equipment operating on the new fronts, complementary works would
be required during the first years to ensure that at the end of the project
period the roads can be handed over to the local provincial authorities in
satisfactory conditions and requiring only routine maintenance. Thus the
project would provide for the purchase and operation of machinery for upgrad-
ing and maintaining such roads during the project period. The machinery pur-
chased would consist of two motorgraders, one bulldozer, two loaders, one



- 11 -
trailer, eight dumpers and ancillary equipment. It would remain INCORA's
property and be pooled with equipment owned by Caminos Vecinales. Annual
costs per km for these complementary works would average Col$ 20,000 (US$780)
during year 1 but decrease to Col$ 15,400 (US$600) by project year 4.
Education Services
4.08      The project would continue INCORA's scho2l construction program by
building about 30 primary schools, averaging 150 m each. The program would
be executed by INCORA and, whenever appropriate, by Instituto Colombiano de
Construcciones Escolares (ICCE), a specialized agency within the Ministry of
Education. The project would also provide each of the 500 primary schools in
Caqueta with sets of teaching materials, assembled by a group of specialists
also within the Ministry of Education, as well as a supply of reading materials.
Reading materials would also be supplied for adult training courses given by
Accion Cultural Popular (ACPO) (Annex 7).
Health Services
4.09      Ten health posts and two health centers would be constructed and
supplied with necessary equipment at average unit costs of Col$ 0.5 million
and Col$ 1.0 million, respectively. Some Col$ 23.8 million would also be
provided for a health program focusing on malaria eradication and improvement
of hygienic conditions (water supply and sewerage) in schools and rural
centers (Annex 7).
Forestry and Erosion Control
4.10      The project would assist an erosion control program to be implemented
by Instituto de Desarollo de los Recursos Naturales Renovables (INDERENA)
(Annex 4). The program would encompass (a) a nine-month study to identify a
suitable pilot project in the Cordillera where socio-economic effects of
anti-erosive measures could be analyzed; and (b) the demarcation and protec-
tion of a 20,000-ha forest reserve (Map 11000) in which to conduct trials to
determine the most appropriate species to be planted on eroded river banks and
to replace natural forest for commercial exploitation. The reserve would be
the basis for identification studies of future reserves in unsettled areas
where larger blocks of forest could be conserved. The problem of overgrazing
in the foothills (para 3.03) would be reduced by intensifying farmers' technical
assistance (para 4.11). Since conservation efforts in other parts of the
country have often failed because of lack of financial support, assurances
were obtained from Government during negotiations that it would allocate to
INDERENA sufficient funds, increasing progressively to Col$ 3.0 million per
year (Annex 4, Table 2), to operate and maintain the forest reserve after the
end of the project development period.
Technical Asistance
4.11      An extension service that would enhance small farmers' (up to 200 ha)
animal husbandry methods and pasture management would be established. Primary



- 12 -
objectives would be to reduce overgrazing and increase farmers' income.  This
project component would be carried out by INCORA with the assistance of ICA
and would cover the salaries of 11 animal husbandry, and two agricultural
officers (at Col$ 120,000 each per year) and 10 additional field agents (at
Col$ 80,000 each per year) during the four project years, their vehicles,
training materials and inputs for demonstrations.
Project Administration
4.12      Project administration costs would cover salaries of INCORA's Project
Manager and five Section Chiefs; headquarter overheads (about 2% of investment
costs); salaries of additional staff needed to expand operations, including
about 10 credit supervisors; operations of an evaluation unit (para 6.10) and
incremental administration costs of other agencies. Vehicles and equipment
(particularly topographic) would also be provided, and three new offices acces-
sible by road in Curillo, Solano, and Cartagena would be constructed. Finally,
three farm input supply stores would be built by INCORA in remote rural centers
and transferred on completion to Central de Cooperativa de la Reforma Agraria
Ltda. (CECORA) (Annex 2). During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
Government that a draft agreement between INCORA and CECORA about these stores
would be submitted to the Bank for approval within one year after loan
signature.
V. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
Project Costs
5.01      Estimated total project costs would be Col$ 1,183 million (US$37.1
million), of which 22%, or Col$ 258 million (US$8.1 million), would be for-
eign exchange. Excluding expenditures for on-farm development, project costs
would amount to Col$ 620 million (US$19.5 million), of which 38%, or Col$ 237
million (US$7.5 million), would be foreign exchange. Base cost estimates are
based on actual costs incurred and the latest bids received for contracts under
the Phase I project, plus information supplied by INCORA and the agencies which
would be involved in the project. Details of these estimates are in Annex 8
and summarized in the table on page 13.
5.02      Physical contingencies of 10% have been included for all items ex-
cept farm credit and labor, to which no physical contingencies has been ap-
plied. In view of the large local cost component (78%), price contingencies
have been calculated in Col$, using the estimated inflation rates in Colombia
of 20% in 1974, 17% in 1975, 15% in 1976 and 12% in 1977 for all items except
livestock, which has been estimated to increase at an annual rate of 15% over
the project period. Project base costs and physical contingencies have been
converted into US$ equivalent at the exchange rate which was in force at the
time of these estimates (September 1974). Price contingencies expressed in
US$ have been calculated by deducting from the above inflation rates an
assumed devaluation rate of 8.5% per year of the Col$ against the US$.



- 13 -
Under these assumptions, price contingencies correspond to 17% in US$(43% in
Col$) of combined base costs and physical contingencies.

million (US$31.6 million) would consist of the proposed Bank loan of Col$ 616.8
(US$19.5 million), or 62% of the balance, and Government funds amounting to
Col$ 387.6 million (US$12.1 million), or 38% of the balance. Annual financial
contributions are shown in Annex 9.
1/   Including price contingencies.

5.04      Bank Loan.  The proposed loan of US$19.5 million, corresponding to
53% of total project costs, would cover the estimated foreign exchange com-
ponent of US$8.1 million and 39% of the local costs, about US$11.4 million, a
large part of which would be for long-term credit for on-farm development.
Government would be the borrower and would bear the exchange risk. The Bank
loan would be at the standard interest rate and repayment would be over 20
years, the approximate economic life of the project, including a grace period
of four years.
5.05      Funds to INCORA.  INCORA would administer Col$ 938.2 million (US$29.5
million) of project funds on behalf of Government. This includes the Bank loan
and Government's contribution to the project components which INCORA would
execute itself. These funds would be utilized as follows:
(a) Long-term Farm Development Credit. Col$ 323.9 million (US$10.2
million) would be lent to Banco Ganadero, at 9% interest, with
Banco Ganadero taking the credit risk, for onlending to project
beneficiaries at 15% (para 6.08). The 6% interest margin to
Banco Ganadero would cover its estimated credit delivery costs
and provide it with a margin as incentive to continue to make
the small size and high risk project loans. Interest earned
from onlending to Banco Ganadero would be credited to INCORA's
project account (para 5.10), as would Banco Ganadero's repayments.
The schedule of such repayments would be related to farmers'
repayment schedule, including a three-year grace period for
capital and interest (Annex 5);
(b) Cattle Fattening Loans. Col$ 5.9 million (US$0.2 million) would
be onlent by INCORA to farmers at 20% annual interest for a
maximum of 20 months or be advanced to COOPERAGRO. COOPERAGRO,
which would take the credit risk, would reimburse the capital
in two equal installments at the 20th and 40th months, and pay
18 to 20% annual interest on the outstanding balance to INCORA.
After seven years, the revolving fund, including both capital
and interest payments would total Col$ 40.7 million;
(c) Road Development, Technical Assistance and INCORA's
Administration. Col$ 375.8 million (US$11.7 million) for these
components would be channelled through INCORA's project account
to private contractors, suppliers, Caminos Vecinales or INCORA's
staff, with INCORA making and receiving payments as appropriate;
(d) Bank's Contribution to Other Components. Col$ 54.1 million
(US$1.7 million) of Bank's reimbursements on other items
carried out by the appropriate Government agencies (para 5.06)
would be channelled through INCORA; and,
(e)  Unallocated.  The amount unallocated has been determined on the
basis of the US dollar equivalent of physical and price contin-
gencies corresponding to items (a) through (d) or US$5.7 million.
The equivalent in local currency is Col$ 178.5 million.



- 15 -
A condition of effectiveness is that INCORA has signed a new agreement (i) with
Banco Ganadero specifying the lending conditions set forth in sub-paragraph (a)
and paragraphs 6.07 and 6.08, and (ii) with COOPERAGRO specifying the new
lending conditions set forth in sub-paragraph (b).
5.06      Funds to Other Agencies.  Col$ 66.2 million (US$2.1 million) (includ-
ing contingencies) would be budgeted by ICCE to the extent that it participates
in the project school construction program, the Ministries of Health and
Education, INDERENA and ICA, and advanced by Government to these agencies for
the execution of their respective project component. Reimbursement under the
Bank loan of appropriate expenditures (para 5.09) would be channelled to these
agencies through INCORA.
5.07      Project funds would be made available by Government in two forms:
Col$ 620.3 million 1/ for infrastructure, forestry and erosion control, tech-
nical assistance and administration would be a grant, while the remainder,
Col$ 384.1 million 1/ for long-term farm development and cattle fattening
loans, would be advanced to INCORA as a 20-year interest-free loan. The grace
period would be of 4 years for the long-term credit and seven years, or the
time needed to establish the revolving fund for the cattle fattening loan.
Cash flow projections (Annex 9, Table 4) indicate that repayments from on-farm
credit would be sufficient to enable INCORA to repay the loan. During nego-
tiations, assurances were obtained from Government that sufficient funds would
be allocated to INCORA and the appropriate agencies to meet the full cost of
the project.
Procurement
5.08      Currently applied procurement procedures, which have proven satis-
factory, would be continued. Road construction and road maintenance equipment
purchase contracts totalling US$ 8.7 million (US$11.9 million including fi-
nancial contingencies), would be let by international competitive bidding in
accordance with procedures outlined in Guidelines for Procurement under World
Bank Loans and IDA Credits. Domestic manufacturers in Colombia would be ac-
corded preferential treatment in bid evaluations, limited to 15% of the c.i.f.
price on imported goods or the customs duties, whichever is lower. Widely
scattered small works such as schools, health centers and administrative buil-
dings and their equipment would be procured in small lots as required. They
would be procured locally under INCORA's competitive bidding procedures, which
are satisfactory to the Bank. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
from Government that the above bidding procedures would be followed and that
INCORA would: (a) employ engineering consultants (para 4.06), acceptable to
the Bank, to assist in analyzing bids and in supervising road construction;
and (b) present, three months in advance, details of the following year's
construction program for Bank concurrence.
1/ Including contingencies.



- 16 -
Disbursements
5.09      Disbursement of the Bank loan would be at the rate of 100% of the
foreign cost of imported equipment, vehicles and materials; 95% of the ex-
factory cost of locally manufactured equipment; 50% of the expenditures for
works to improve hygienic conditions in schools and rural centers, and 70% of
the amount in project sub-accounts for long-term farm credit, the revolving
fund for cattle fattening loans, road construction, construction of education
and health facilities, installations and studies for the forestry and erosion
control program and the technical assistance program. About US$3.3 million
or 17% of the loan, would be unallocated. Disbursement would be made against
statements of expenditure submitted by INCORA on behalf of Government and
supported by appropriate documentation. Disbursement claims for long-term
credit would be supported by certified statements from Banco Ganadero, giving
the number of head received and those already in the farmer's possession at
the time the farmer's loan was approved. Claims for road construction would
be certified by the engineering consultants and INCORA.
Accounts
5.10      Current INCORA accounting procedures follow general procedures of
the Ministry of Agriculture, but they do not facilitate the financial analysis
needed for monitoring project performance. Modifications required are given
in Annex 3. INCORA would prepare annual cash flow statements showing actual
sources and use of funds, segregated according to different sub-headings,
including capital and current expenditures. INCORA would maintain a separate
project account, with sub-accounts for each project component. Government
agencies responsible for implementing a project component would likewise
maintain separate accounts to record project transactions. During negotia-
tions, assurances were obtained from INCORA and the Government that agencies
would set up such accounts, and INCORA indicated that it would seek Bank
assistance to help it change its accounting procedures so as to permit a better
analysis of its financial situation.
Audit
5.11      INCORA's accounts are audited annually by Contraloria General,
reporting directly to the President on Government's and Government agencies'
accounts. This auditing is satisfactory and, during negotiations, assurances
were obtained from Government that INCORA's audited financial statements and
the auditor's report would be sent to the Bank within six months of the closing
date of the accounts.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
.6.01      INCORA would continue to be responsible for project administration
and management. In 1971, INCORA created a Colonization Division of 11 pro-
fessionals at headquarters, headed by a Division Chief to whom eight coloni-
zation project managers in the field report directly. This straight line of



- 17 -
responsibility between the Chief of INCORA's Colonization Division and project
managers has proven efficient in decision-making and, during negotiations,
assurances were obtained from Government that this responsibility chain for
the Caqueta Projects would not be changed without prior exchange of views
with the Bank.
6.02      The Colonization Division is currently within the Engineering
Department and the Colonization Division Chief is responsible to the Director
of that department, who, in turn, is responsible to the General Manager.
This chain of command, however, has proved cumbersome in expediting the final-
izing of contracts with outside agencies. It is expected that the Colonization
Division will be given more authority at the time of the general reorganization
of INCORA. In any case, INCORA's organizational setup would be reassessed once
Government plans are in a more advanced stage.
6.03      The Project Manager in Florencia would be responsible for field
operations. He would continue to be in charge of day-to-day activities
through five section heads, dealing, respectively, with agriculture, social,
legal, engineering and administrative matters. The existing post of Deputy
Manager would be cancelled because it proved to be a useless additional
echelon and an obstacle to training section heads for project manager respon-
sibilities. The Project Manager would himself nominate his replacement
during his absence from project headquarters. The activities of each section
are shown in Chart 8680. In order to ensure proper coordination between the
several project components, the Project Manager would be given authority
over their execution. He would also be consulted on all policy matters
affecting the project administration. The present Project Manager is a
particularly competent individual and it is likely that he will continue in
post. However, should a replacement be required, future appointments would
be made after informing the Bank. During negotiations, assurances on these
points were obtained.
Agreements with Outside Agencies
6.04      On-lending programs with Banco Ganadero and COOPERAGRO and school
construction through ICCE (para 4.08) could be implemented under renewed
agreements that would not differ significantly from those currently in
force. For complementary road-works and road maintenance, forestry and
erosion control and technical assistance programs, INCORA would enter into
agreements, respectively, with Caminos Vecinales, INDERENA and ICA. The
content of their new agreements and a description of the organizations in-
volved are given in Annex 10. Draft agreements between INCORA and Caminos
Vecinales, INDERENA and ICA have been received by the Bank at negotiations.
The signature of the new agreements with the organizations mentioned above
is a condition of effectiveness.
6.05      A new agreement would also be signed with the Ministries of Educa-
tion and Health to continue to staff, operate, and maintain school and health



- 18 -
facilities. The Phase II project, however, would also include more construc-
tion as well as expansion and diversification of the respective programs
(paras. 4.08 and 4.09). During negotiations assurances were therefore obtained
from Government that, within six months of loan signature, current agreements
with both Ministries would be renewed to include the additional facilities
and services, and that the budgetary allocations of these Ministries to operate
and maintain project facilities would be sufficient.
Land Titling
6.06      Until mid-1973, the land registration section of INCORA in Florencia
was responsible for finalizing land titles for Caqueta. However, in an effort
to avoid disputes which had arisen between owners, INCORA increased the pre-
cision standards and temporarily transferred finalization of the titles to
Bogota, with a resulting drop in the number of titles issued. During negotia-
tions, assurances were obtained that: (a) local topographers would be appro-
priately equipped and trained to achieve the new precision standards; (b)
finalization of the land titles would be maintained in Florencia; and (c) the
titling unit would complete about 1,500 titles per year.
Lending Procedures and Terms
6.07      Long-term credit would continue to be issued through Banco Ganadero
according to ongoing procedures, which have proven satisfactory. INCORA's
field staff receive farmers' applications, and, together with Banco Ganadero's
farm planners, prepare farm plans and loan requests. These requests are
examined by itinerant loan committees, composed of Banco Ganadero and INCORA
staff and a farmers' representative, who determine whether candidates meet
the following criteria:
(a)  have been assessed creditworthy by Banco Ganadero;
(b)  have no access to other sources of credit on reasonable
terms and possess less than 25 head of cattle;
(c)  have at least 10 ha of land cleared and under pasture;
(d)  live on, operate and possess a farm of between 30 and 200 ha;
(e)  own the farm under written land title or land assignation
contract; and
(f)  have agreed to accept INCORA's and Banco Ganadero's
supervision of farm development.
6.08      Farmers' repayment period would be over 12 years, with a three-
year grace period.  The annual interest rate would be a nominal 15% 1/
applied on the outstanding balance, with a capitalization of interest over
1/   This interest rate of 15% would correspond to a 23% interest under the
particular calculation method used by Banco Ganadero (Annex 5).



- 19 -
the grace period (the detailed repayment schedule is given in Annex 5).
Assuming a long-term inflation rate averaging 15% p.a., farm budget studies
show that farmers would obtain a net income sufficient to provide them with
the necessary incentives to participate in the project. These studies also
show that if an average annual income of US$78 per capita (para 7.05) (half
the US$175 per capita rural income in Colombia) over the 12-year repayment
period is accepted as a minimum, any higher interest rate would exclude
settlers with 30 to 50-ha farms (more than 25% of the farmers in the area)
from participating in the project credit program,
6.09      In terms of an average inflation rate over the last two years of
20% p.a., the proposed interest rate would be negative. It is the Bank's
policy to require borrowers whenever possible, to charge positive interest
rates on subloans. In this particular case, however, cheap credit is justi-
fied on the grounds that (a) there are at present no satisfactory systems of
subsidization other than through interest rates; several systems, including
subsidized cattle prices or the purchase of new settlers' grain production at
higher than market prices, have been investigated, but they would require
controls on local and national levels which would exceed the scope of this
project; (b) the problems posed by the inherent fungibility of credit and
possible misuse of project credit is minimized because of INCORA's and Banco
Ganadero's close supervision, the beneficiaries' lack of proper fungible re-
sources, and the fact that loans are in kind and invested in the development
of the farm; and (c) because all institutional rates of interest to agricul-
ture are subsidized, it would be impractical to require small farmers to pay
positive rates on their initial loan to start developing their farms, while
large commercial ranchers in the area have access to abundant sources of sub-
sidized credit from Law 5 funds (Annex 2). Under these circumstances, a sub-
sidized rate of interest for project beneficiaries would be acceptable to the
Bank. The problem of preventing the discrepancy between the interest rate
and inflation rate from growing is minimized insofar as the inflation rate,
which has already been decreasing during the first months of 1975, is projected
to return to a 10% to 15% level within about four to five years. Indexing
is currently only applied to the Colombian savings and loans system and the
Caqueta project would not be an appropriate testing ground for such a sophis-
ticated technique to the exclusion of the other agricultural sector credit
instruments. Since the farmers' incentive to borrow project funds depends
largely on other credit terms prevailing in the area, assurances were obtained
from Government that the proposed interest rate and repayment schedule would
be subject to revision if Government's regulations of credit to the agri-
cultural sector are changed.
Pj2ject Evaluation
6.10      A project evaluation and monitoring unit would be set up within
INCORA to conduct a continuous study of farm budgets and the rate and effects
of settlement, deforestation and herd development, using a random sample of
settlers. The unit would be composed of one agricultural economist, one
sociologist/anthropologist and one agriculturalist/forester. These profes-
sionals would be assisted by the agricultural faculty of the Universidad



- 20 -
Nacional de Colombia and by not less than six field surveyors, all being
provided with the necessary operating facilities. In addition to preparing
quarterly progress reports along lines which proved satisfactory under
Phase I, this staff would prepare annual evaluation reports which would give
actual achievements compared with goals shown in the table of paragraph 4.03
and Annex 8, Table 2.
VII. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, PRICES AND FARM INCOME
Production
7.01      Phase II of the Caqueta Project would bring about the establishment
of some 200,000 ha of improved pastures that would support a cattle population
of about 226,000 head, equivalent to about 180,000 adult units (0.9 head per
ha). Beef sales from the project herd would increase progressively to about
40,000 head (about 16,000 ton) at full development in 1995. Additional out-
puts of Phases I and II combined would be about 75,000 head (30,000 tons live-
weight) per year at full development. This would represent an increase of
about 23% over what would be the regional production without the project at
current growth and extraction rates. A separate component would be the
development of a fattening program under which about 3,000 steers (1,200 ton
liveweight) would be fattened and sold every year.
7.02      In addition to cattle, the proposed project would also produce
grains (maize and rice), pigs and other staple food crops. Grain and pig
productions would occur mainly during the development period when crops are
grown on land cleared in the dry season and the residue fed to the pigs.
Although yields are low (around 800 kg per ha), grain crops play an important
role since they provide a substantial part of farmers' subsistence and cash
income during the early years of farm development. Phase II would also yield
an annual steady production of about 6,200 tons of cassava and 25,000 tons of
plantain, mostly to cope with on-farm needs, both human and livestock.
Marketing
7.03      At present, beef production in the region is about 33,000 tons per
year (liveweight), of which about 40% is marketed locally and 60% is absorbed
by other regions, mainly Cali. The project would be in line with Government's
"Plan Bovino" (para 2.04), since it would contribute to (a) reduce the current
shortage of meat products on the domestic market where demand is expected to
increase due to growth of both income and population, especially in urban
areas, and (b) indirectly increase exports. Grain production would be marketed
by Instituto de Mercadeo Agropecuario (IDEMA), which currently buys the sur-
pluses of the small and medium farms through its several agencies disseminated
throughout the project area. Although marketing arrangements are rather poor
in the area, they would be considerably improved with the extension of the
road network and the construction of a slaughterhouse in Florencia (para 3.08).
CCOOPERAGRO assists its members in the sale of their fattened animals, thus
protecting them against unfair pricing methods.



- 21 -
Prices
7.04      In Caqueta, due to its relatively remote location, prices for
inputs are generally higher than in most parts of the country, while prices
for outputs are lower. Prices used in the financial analysis of farm budgets
are those now prevailing in the area, increased by an annual inflation rate of
15% throughout the repayment period of farmers' loans. This rate has been
adopted as an average of price increase for agricultural products in Colombia
(para 5.02). Farm-gate price for beef (liveweighlt) would be USI 49.4/kg
equivalent.
Farm Income
7.05      Three farm models have been selected to represent expected farm
incomes resulting from the project (Annex 5). Model I represents farms from
80 to 200 ha receiving one single loan for an initial herd of one bull and
15 cows. Model II represents a farm from 30 to 80 ha receiving one single
loan for an initial herd of one bull and 10 cows. Finally, Model III, repre-
sents farms similar to the those in Model I, but receiving two loans, the
first for one bull and 15 breeding cows and the second for 10 more cows. A
summary of the settlers' financial position is given below for the repayment
period and at full development.

With families averaging six to seven people, per capita annual total net in-
come at full development would range between US$250 and US$550, as compared
with a present level of about US$70 in the area and with a projected average
rural income in Colombia in 1995 of US$470. These annual incomes and the
capital gains on herd and land would be sufficient to justify farmers' parti-
cipation in the project.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The project long-term credit program would directly benefit about
2,850 settler families, while a large proportion of the 12,000 settler families
living in the area would benefit indirectly from infrastructure works, support-
ing services and increased employment opportunities. During the four-year
project investment period, the project would create an average of 7,000 per-
manent jobs per year. The livestock development program alone would create
permanent fuller employment opportunities for 2,850 families (about 9,000
active persons). The project would also contribute to improving educational
and health conditions in the area. Important secondary benefits would include
the development, albeit on a limited scale, of more efficient agricultural
extension and forestry and erosion control services. General nutrition stand-
ards would improve as a result of the increase in domestically consumed beef
production. Although the specific impact of INCORA's colonization projects
is unknown1, it is likely that they contributed to reducing urbanization. A
study by INCORA on colonization in Colombia (1974) indicates that net urban
migration decreased from 5.3% of total population p.a. during the first half
of the 1960s to 4.1% during the period 1964-70. Conversely, annual rural
population growth increased from 1.3 to 2.1% p.a. during these periods.
8.02    The project would contribute to maintalning a satisfactory land
tenure pattern in the area and thus contribute'to Colombia's efforts to
improve the living conditions of the rural poor. It is estimated that
about three-quarters of the settlers' families in the area would in-
directly benefit from the infrastructure and services provided by the
Phase I and II Caqueta Projects at a combined cost in current terms of
US$6,600 per settler family, including project loans of an average
US$3,600 per family (Annex 8, Table 6). This cost is in line with other
settlement projects and compares favorably with other land development
projects in Colombia, particularly In view of the large share (56%) of
repayable productive Investments -included In these costs.
8.03      Using prevailing market prices, the gross value of incremental pro-
duction from Phase II would be, at full development, about Col$ 225 million
(US$8.8 million). Net quantified benefits, after deduction of project costs,
would amount to about Col$ 165 million (US$6.4 million). In addition, the
project would bring about substantial savings to users of the road system.
The part of these savings, corresponding to beef and grain production other
than that accounted for as output of direct project beneficiaries, has been
quantified and, at full development, would amount to about Col$ 34 million
per year (Annex 11, Appendix 1). These savings have been allocated in equal
proportion to the two phases of the project. Unquantified benefits would
arise from transportation of persons on project roads and from the education
and health programs.



- 23 -
8.04      Because of the geographical location of the area, beef produced
by the project is not likely to be exported, but the supply made available
for local consumption would free a certain volume of produce in more favorably
located areas for exports. Thus, indirectly, the project would contribute
to increased foreign exchange earnings.
8.05      When costs and benefits are discounted over the 23-year period in
which the project's economic life has been assessed, the economic rate of
return of Phase II would be 13.8%. This compares with a rate of return of
15.0% for Phase I. The lower rate for Phase II, is the result of making a
large number of smaller loans. The rate of return for both phases would be
about 14.1%. These rates have been calculated excluding the cost of education
and health facilities, which correspond to about 5% of total costs and, for
which the benefits cannot be quantified.
8.06      To measure project sensitivity to deviations from basic assumptions,
several alternatives have been analyzed, including either a cost increase of
20X or a benefit decrease of 20%. In no case would the rate of return be
lower than 10%. Details on economic analysis are given in Annex 11.
IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations, INCORA handed over to the Bank draft agreements
between INCORA and Caminos Vecinales, INDERENA and ICA (para 6.04).
9.02      During negotiations, the following main assurances were obtained:
(a) sufficient funds would be allocated to INCORA and the appropriate
agencies involved in the project to meet the full cost of the
project (para 5.07);
(b) procurement procedures specified in paragraph 5.08 would be
followed and that INCORA would (a) employ engineering consult-
ants, acceptable to the Bank, to assist in analyzing bids and
in supervising road construction, and (b) present, three
months in advance, the following year's construction program
for Bank concurrence (para 5.08);
(c) INCORA and the other Government agencies involved in the
project would set up separate project accounts, and INCORA's
accounting procedures would be revised to permit a better
analysis of its financial situation (para 5.10);
(d) the straight line of responsibility between the Chief of
INCORA's Colonization Division and the Project Manager would
not be changed without prior exchange of views with the
Bank (para 6.01);



- 24 -
(e) appointments to the post of Project Manager would only be
made after the Bank had been informed (para 6.03);
(f) the Project Manager would be given authority over the
execution of project components; he would be consulted
on policy matters affecting the project decided within INCORA
and on important assignments of staff to project admin-
istration (para 6.03); and
(g) interest rate and repayment schedule of long-term credit
loans would be subject to revision by the Bank if Govern-
ment's regulations of credit to the agricultural sector
are changed (para 6.09).
9.03      A condition of effectiveness is the signature by INCORA and the
appropriate agencies of the following agreements: with Banco Ganadero for
long-term credit specifying conditions set forth in paragraph 5.05(a) and
lending procedures and terms set forth in paragraphs 6.07 and 6.08; with
COOPERAGRO for the cattle fattening program; Caminos Vecinales for complementary
road works and road maintenance; with INDERENA for forestry and erosion control;
and with ICA for technical assistance (paras 5.05 and 6.04).
9.04      The project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$19.5
million for a term of 20 years, including a four-year grace period.

COLOMBIA
CAQUETA RURAL SETTLEMENT PROJECT (PHASE II)
Bank Loans to the Agricultural Sector in Colombia
1.        Including Caqueta Land Colonization Project (Phase I), the Bank has
made five loans for agricultural development in Colombia in the last eight
years, totalling US$57.4 million. The Phase I project is covered in the
main report and the other four are discussed below.
Credit Projects
2.        Loan 624-CO (June 1969, US$17 million).  This loan finances a
supervised credit program of INCORA and, at the time of appraisal, was
expected to improve productivity on about 2,500 medium-sized irrigated
and rainfed farms. After four years of loan effectiveness (end 1973),
INCORA had made 1,700 medium- and long-term loans and 2,500 short-term loans.
During 1970-72, the project was affected by the lack of clarity in application
of the Agrarian Reform Law and by INCORA's reluctance to execute the project
because of a change in its policy. INCORA indeed preferred to concentrate
its resources on farmers who are beneficiaries in the agrarian reform program.
Project performance changed in early 1973 dramatically when INCORA changed
its attitude, increased project staff and made the necessary organizational
changes, and the project area was enlarged. Lending under the project picked
up and was in 1973 higher than the total of the three previous years. The
project is expected to be fully disbursed by mid-1975.
3.        Loan 651-CO (December 1969, US$18.3 million).  This loan supports
a credit project for livestock development and is the continuation of Loan
448-CO of May 1966, the balance of which (about US$3.3 million) was cancelled
in 1972. Caja de Credito Agrario, Industrial y Minero (Caja Agraria) failed
in the 1970-72 period to provide sufficient short-term financing of working
capital to purchase feeder steers but this was resolved in 1973. The finan-
cial situation has since improved and the project has made more satisfactory
progress. Development was further assisted by changes in Caja Agraria and
project administration, extension of the project area to cover the whole
country, including Caqueta, and introduction of a greater flexibility in
regard to on-lending terms. As a result, the number of loans approved in
1973 has exceeded those made in 1972 and disbursements are expected to be
completed, as scheduled in mid-1975.
Irrigation and Drainage Projects
4.        Loan 502-CO (1967, US$9 million).  This loan finances the Atlantico
No. 3 Irrigation Project which provided for the construction of an irrigation,
drainage and flood interceptor network to irrigate 3,900 ha and drainage and
flood protection for an additional 6,000 ha of dry farming land. The project



ANNEX 1
Page 2
also allowed for investments in agricultural machinery, marketing facilities,
field trials, staff training and funds to cover feasibility studies for the
second stage of the project. Because of unexpectedly severe soils quality
limitations, requiring changes in the location and size of the project area,
technical problems in the construction of irrigation and drainage works, and
non-compliance of contractors to time schedules, the first phase works had
to be redesigned and have fallen two years behind schedule. As a result of
this, poor project management and inadequate supporting services to farmers,
agricultural development has been slow and limited in the area covered.
Although INCORA, the project executing agency, took the necessary corrective
measures at the end of 1973, civil works are not expected to be completed
before mid-1974 over a total area to be irrigated of about 3,750 ha. The
closing date has been postponed to the end of 1975.
5.        Loan 849-CO (1972, US$5 million).  This loan finances the second
stage of the Atlantico project. During appraisal, it was decided that devel-
opment of the 6,000 ha of dry farming land, which would be protected from flood
by works financed under the loan for Stage I, would be transferred to Stage II.
Construction of drainage works in this project has also fallen behind schedule,
but INCORA has taken appropriate steps to improve the contractor's performance.
A revised plan for the implementation of the other project components is in
process of being finalized. Although it is too early to pass judgment on the
progress of agricultural development in this area, the land use pattern in the
Stage II area will be less intensive than originally assumed because of soil
limitations.

CAQUETA RURAL SETTLEMENT PROJECT (PHASE II)
Banking and Credit
A. The System of Financial Intermediaries
1.        The Colombian banking system is characterized by a high degree of
government intervention. Most interest rates on both deposit liabilities and
loans are fixed and there is a complex of compulsory investment regimes, special
rediscount facilities and reserve requirements which are employed to allocate
resources mobilized by the banking system priority sectors. The Monetary Board
(MOB), of which both the Central Bank and the Ministry of Agriculture are mem-
bers, is responsible for administering controls on the financial sector.
2.        The Central Bank (Banco de la Republica - BOR) is the bank of issue
and the monetary authority. It administers five special sector finance funds
which extend loans and discount to financial intermediaries. One of these
funds, the Fondo Financiero Agropecuario (FFA), provides funds to credit insti-
tutions for the purpose of financing the agricultural and livestock sectors.
3.        The major financial intermediaries are the commercial banks, the
development finance companies (Sociedades Financieras) and two large official
specialized banking institutions: the Caja de Credito Agrario, Industrial y
Minero (Caja Agraria) and the Central Mortgage Bank (BCI{), which is engaged in
housing finance. Among the 24 commercial banks in Colombia, three are semi-
official: the Banco Ganadero, which is engaged principally in long-term live-
stock finance, the Banco Cafetero and the Banco Popular. The assets of these
intermediaries, totalling Col$ 74.5 billion in 1972, are given in Table 1.
4.        The most significant recent developments in the Colombian financial
sector have been the emergence of the extra-bank market and the system of
savings and loans. Their rapid growth is the consequence of the higher rates
of interest prevailing in this market. The growtlh of the savings and loans
svstem, which indexed interest rates since its beginning in mid 1972, is par-
ticularlv signlificant (its assets were at the eud of 1973 about Col$ 5 billion,
or half of all inistitutional agrictultural credit outstanding).
B. Agricultulral Credit
5.        Institutional credit to agriculture totalled Col$ 8.2 billion in
1971 and about Col$ 9.3 billion in 1972 (Table 2). About 90% of institutional
credit to agriculture is provided by monetary intermediaries, the remaining
being provided by INCORA and its affiliated cooperatives. These figures do



ANNEX 2
Page 2
not include the Fondos Ganaderos, which are livestock funds placing their port-
folios of cattle with recipient farmers on a profit-sharing basis and which
amounted in 1973 to Col$ 0.73 billion. Including the latter, total agricultural
credit amounted in 1973 to Col$ 10.0 billion.
Sources of Funds
6.         As the monetary intermediaries provide 90% of all agricultural credit
in Colombia, the inflation process and its effect on monetary balances should
have a significant effect on the volume of finance available to the agricultural
sector. Prior to 1973, there were no noticeable repressive effects of inflation
on real money balances. However, coincident with the large increase in the rate
of inflation in 1973, from 13.8% to 25.0%, the stock of money, narrowly defined
(demand deposits and currency) grew by 28.9% in nominal terms, or only 3.9% in
real terms, compared to a 10.7% real increase in 1972. The increase in the
velocity of circulation of money and subsequent reduction in real balances
has been concentrated principally in Central Bank liabilities. Nevertheless,
this overall tendency has implications for all institutions dependent on money
issue, including the agricultural banks.
7.         The commercial banking system, including the Banco Ganadero but ex-
cluding Caja Agraria, relies principally upon demand deposit issue for funds.
At year-end 1972, total demand deposit liabilities of the commercial banking
system were Col$ 17,898 million, and savings deposit liabilities were Col$ 3,100
million. In 1972, total commercial banking system demand deposits increased
at a rate of 22.4% versus a 13.8% increase in the price level, or 8.6% in real
terms, and rising inflation had no noticeable repressive effect on these liabil-
ities of the commercial banking sector. A similar trend persisted in 1973,
though the rate of increase in money issue in real terms declined slightly,
with a 23.6% increase in demand deposit liabilities through the end of August,
against an 18.7% increase in the price level, for an annual real rate of in-
crease of 7.4%. Commercial bank savings deposits exhibited a remarkable in-
crease in 1972 of almost 50% in nominal terms and 36% in real terms, partly
because of an increase in savings deposit rates from 4.0% to 8.5%, effective
early in the year. In 1973, however, the trend reversed, with total savings
deposit issue expanding at 18.8% through August, roughly equal to the increase
in the price level for the same period. The Caja Agraria, has experienced a
similar trend in deposit issue. Total savings deposits increased by 40.6% in
1972, versus a 13.8% increase in prices, or 26.8% in real terms. Growth in
these monetary liabilities in real terms has since decreased significantly,
to an annual rate of only 5.0% in real terms through August 1973.
S.         Continued high inflation should continue to retard the rate of
mobilization of funds by monetary intermediaries, and therefore the volume of
finance available to agriculture. Institutions dependent chiefly upon demand
deposit issue, such as the Banco Ganadero and Banco Cafetero, would tend to
be restricted more than the Caja Agraria, which issues savings deposits princi-
pally. The volume of funds mobilized through savings deposits issue is clearly
responsive to higher interest rates, as evidenced by the extremely rapid growth
of the savings and loans and the responsiveness of bank savings deposit flows
to the modest increase in rates instituted in 1972. Therefore, the volume of



ANNEX 2
Page 3
finance available to agriculture will depend to a great degree on government
anti-inflation policies and interest rate policies regarding the agricultural
sector versus the housing, commercial and industrial sectors.
The New Fifth Law and FFA
9.        Offsetting these repressive effects on agricultural finance is the
expected impact of the new Fifth Law of 1973. With the purpose of directing
substantially greater resources to the agricultural and livestock sectors,
the Colombian Congress, with the Ministry of Agriculture's support, passed
Law 5 of 1973, which, through a new forced investment regime, will reallocate
a substantial portion of resources mobilized by the commercial banking system
for lending to agriculture. Under this law and pursuant decrees, 1/ the
commercial banks are required to invest 15% of their placements in 8% agricul-
tural development bonds issued by the Central Bank and administered by FFA.
These funds are then relent through rediscount facilities to financial
institutions, including the commercial banks, for the making of loans for
agricultural and livestock activities. The specialized agricultural lending
institutions, including those classified as commercial banks, such as the
Banco Ganadero, are exempt from this forced investment regime requirement.
10.       The net effect of the provisions of new Law 5 funds on total funds
available to agricultural lendings is difficult to assess in view of the uncer-
taintv as to the allocation by the intermediaries of their other funds to this
sector. Indeed, the intermediaries could in part compensate this increase of
funds to agriculture under Law 5 by diverting their current lendings with funds
provided bv demand and savings deposits from the agricultural sector to other
sectors. However, if there is no such substitution, current agricultural lend-
ings and those of Law 5 funds would increase investments in FFA bonds from 5% to
15% of total commercial bank placements and forced investments, and would in-
crease total finance to agriculture by about Col$ 2 billion, equivalent to about
20% of the 1972 agricultural lendings of Col$ 10.0 billion. This further increases
the intervention of Government in the financial sector, especially in the com-
mercial banking system and principally through the introduction of forced invest-
ment regime requirements (Table 3).
Interest Rates 2/ and Credit Terms
11.       Until September 1974, interest rates in the financial sector varied
widelv. The commercial bank loan rates ceiling had been fixed at 14%, with
an additional 0.5% per year of term after the first.  Effective rates for these
loans were in practice between 20% and 24% because of the required compensating
btdances, fees and charges.  Rates through otlher intermediaries were, in general,
lower. Caia Agrarin rates on livestock loans financed with its own resources
and BOR discounts were as follows:
1/   The last one being that of September 1974.
2/   All rates cited do not include the 1% life Insurance premium charged by
all institUttions.

Caja Agraria was under legal obligation to issue long-term livestock loans for
seven years to farmers without land title as security and 12 years to those
who can provide the mortgage or land title guarantee. INCORA has maintained an
8% interest payment applied on the annual quota under a particular system which
does not provide for capitalization of deferred interest payments during the
grace period. This payment method is equivalent to a 6.25% annual interest
rate on outstanding balances. In September 1974, the Monetary Board issued a
resolution fixing the interest rates at 15% for agricultural and livestock
breeding loans and 20% for cattle fattening loans, made with FFA funds.
Additional fees of 1% to 2% are to be charged to large commercial farmers for
technical assistance. The law requires, however, a corresponding intensifica-
tion of this assistance. Land security requirements have been relaxed.
12.       The general tendency to narrower spreads has serious implications for
small lending in Colombia, and for small farmer livestock lending in particular.
Financial intermediaries will indeed tend to compensate their increased finan-
cial costs by spreading other costs over larger size loans. Given the terms of
the present Fifth Law decree providing for spreads of only 1% to 3%, the re-
sources now being accumulated by FFA must be regarded principally as credit
resources for large, and possibly medium-scale ranches. At the same time,
demand deposit issue, which offers banks their widest spread and often provides
the margin necessary for small farmer lending, is being repressed by inflation.
If present low interest rates and high inflation persists, small farmer lendings
will depend more than in the past on special programs and INCORA for their credit
sources.
C. Agricultural Credit Institutions
13.       The three main agricultural credit institutions are Caja Agraria,
Banco Ganadero and INCORA. The latter is described in detail in Annex 3.
Caja Agraria
14.       Background.  Although in this project, the Caja Agraria would not be
directly involved, it is related to its success. Caja Agraria acts as a bank-
ing agent for INCORA's supervised credit program, provides seasonal credit
within the project area, and is the designated agency from which graduated



ANNEX 2
Page 5
settlers are assumed to obtain needed credit to pursue their development after
initial take-off. Caja Agraria is well known to the Bank, since it administers
the Livestock Development Project (651-CO) and supplies banking and accounting
services for the Agricultural Credit Project (624-CO).
15.        Objectives.  The Caja Agraria was formed in 1931 as a semi-official
_oint stock companv. Its main objective is to improve agricultural production,
mainly by the small farmer, through the provision of credit and inputs. It
also provides some technical assistance to its borrowers and, through its
810 branches (end 1972), it sells agricultural machinery and a wide range of
agricultural supplies and equipment. It also provides savings and insurance
facilities, and administers some agricultural development projects.
16.        Organization and Management.  The Caja Agraria is semi-autonomous,
and makes its own management and lending decisions, within the framework of
Government's general agricultural policy. It is controlled by a 10-man Board
of Directors, comprising the Minister of Agriculture as Chairman, and including
representatives of the President of the Republic, ICA, IDEMA, Central Bank,
Coffee Growers' Federation and Farmers' Association. The Minister of Finance,
although not a member, may also speak and vote at Board meetings.
17.        The Caja Agraria is administered by a General Manager nominated by
the Board, who is assisted by five sub-managers and a Secretary General head-
ing departments covering administration, banking, finance, commerce, develop-
ment, credit and coordination. Branches have a large measure of autonomy and
can approve loans up to certain limits for the various categories.
18.        Resources.  The Caja Agraria is the largest monetary intermediary
in Colombia and relies principally upon savings and sight deposits and BOR
discounts for resources. The breakdown of liabilities of the Caja Agraria,
totalling Col$ 10.3 billion at the end of 1972, is given in Table 4.
19.       Uses of Funds.  At year-end 1972, loans of Col$ 6,293 million accounted
for 61% of total bank assets. Most of the balance is in investments and stocks
of agricultural goods. Agricultural and livestock loans accounted for Col$ 6,038
million, or 96% of total loans. Of this total, 59% is composed of loans to
small farmers. The Caja Agraria has substantially increased the proportion of
its total lending to small farmers In recent years, as indicated in Table 5.
20.       Thle average size of new loans made to small farmers with resources
other than special program sources was Col$ 6,887.  These small loans accounted
for 94% of the number granted and 71% of total new lending.  Loans backed by
mortgage, clhattel, or other guarantees accounted for 49% of total loans out-
standing at year-end 1972 and 72% of thie value of the outstanding agricultural
loan portfolio.
21.        Because of tihe 1972 increase in deposit rates, without compensating
increases in loan rates, Caja Agraria spreads have narrowed. In an effort to
reduce unit loan costs and to attain the Caja's financial goal of a breakeven
In nominal terms, the policy of increasing the proportion of Caja's resources



ANNEX 2
Page 6
allocated to small farmers terminated in 1973. The average small farmer loan
made in 1973 was approximately Col$ 10,040 versus Col$ 6,887 in the prior year,
and the small farmer share of total new lending declined. Small farmer loan
policies will depend in the future upon changes in interest rates charged on
loan and deposit rates. An anticipated shift in financial resources from depo-
sit issue to FFA discounts under Law 5 shouldI also decrease the proportion of
Caja Agraria's lending to small farmers.
22.       Financial Results.  The Caja Agraria aims to make its income exceed
its expenditure by a small margin each year, and to reinvest all profits. The
ratio of overdues to total portfolio is 12%, but most overdues are repaid with-
in the next year. Accumulated provisions for bad debts were Col$ 177 million
in 1972, equal to 2.8% of total portfolio. The Caja Agraria believes that its
bad debt provision policy is extremely conservative, and that actual losses
from defaults amount to only Col$ 30 million.
Banco Ganadero
23.       Objectives. Banco Ganadero was established in 1956 and reorganized
in 1959. Its principal objective is to provide credit for the development
of livestock production. By law, at least 70% of its lending must be in the
livestock sector. The rest may be for commercial and industrial purposes
preferably to small-and medium-sized agricultural processing enterprises.
Of total livestock credit outstanding at year-end 1972, Banco Ganadero pro-
vided 21%, with a total livestock portfolio of Col$ 1,096 million.
24.       Ownership.  Banco Ganadero is a semi-official institution with share
ownership divided between private individuals and the state, 80% and 20% re-
spectivelv, as mandated by Law 26 of 1959. The private share subscriptions
are forced rather than voluntary in character. According to Law 26, 1% of
total assets invested by individuals in ranching must be invested in shares
of either the Banco Ganadero or the Fondos Ganaderos. In addition, recipients
of loans in excess of Col$ 20,000 must purchase shares in the Banco Ganadero
equal to 1% of the value of the loan.
25.       Orgarnization and Management.  Banco Canadero has a Board of five
Directors, one representing the Presidenit of the Republic, one the Minister
of Agriculture, and the others the private sharelhol(ders.  There is no fixed
term of office for lBoard members. The General Manager is supported by the
tliree sulbmanangers responsible for (a) Technical Affairs, (b) Credit (including
ireasurv and Secretariat) and (c) Branches, Accounting, Legal and Industrial.
The Bank operated 80 office branches at mld-year 1973.
26.       Sources and Uses of Fun(ds.  At year-end 1972, total resources of
Banco Ganadero equalled about Col$ 2.8 billion (Table 6).  Demand deposit issue
has been the principal liability (about 35% of total assets) for mobilizing
resources from the private sector. In the past the slhare of cattle in the
portfolio increased, but more and more new loans lhave been allocated to agro-
industries. In 1973 the total livestock portfolio increased only marginally,
from Col$ 1.13 million at year-end 1972 to only Col$ 1.14 million at the end of
October 1973, while the total portfolio increased 7.3% from Col$ 1.37 million



ANNEX 2
Page 7
to ColS 1.47 million. This shift in portfolio composition has reportedly re-
sulted from a reduction in special program lending (AID, INCORA, IDB) and higher
profitability on non-livestock loans for which higher effective rates of interest
can be charged. The average loan made in 1971, 1972 and 1973 had a value of
Col$ 78,000, Col$ 93,400 and Col$ 84,100, respectively, which constitutes an over-
all decline in real terms in the average size of the loan.
27.       Banco Ganadero's principal purpose is to mobilize the maximum re-
sources possible for lending to cattle ranchers, rather than maximize returns
to shareholders. This reflects basically the interests of its shareholders,
including the private shareholders who all are ranchers and whose participation
is determined on a mandatory basis. 3oth the public and private shareholders
also support a low interest rate position with respect to agricultural lending.
In the aggregate, the private shareholders, who are also the recipients of bank
loans, obtain the same overall net benefit, whether they pay higher interest
rates on cattle loans, and earn a real return on their shareholdings, or whether
they suffer a decapitalization of their shareholdings in return for cheaper
cattle credits. As a result, the Banco Ganadero has chosen to accept low rates
of interest for cattle loans and a financial breakeven in nominal terms, rather
than higher rates of interest and higher, possibly positive, returns.
28.       The threat of decapitalization of Banco Ganadero through negative
rates of return to equity is minimized by the formula for mandatory share owner-
ship. The share capital of the bank is basically a function of the assets em-
ployed in ranching in Colombia, and, since these assets are always increasing
in money terms, Banco Ganadero is assured of a continuing flow of externally
financial equity capital.
29.       Banco Ganadero is widely regarded as a well disciplined and efficient
institution operating on commercial principles. However, its ratio of total
costs, excluding interest and provision, to total portfolio was 11.6% in 1972.
This is quite high since Banco Ganadero's portfolio is composed mainly of large-
scale loans, and is long-term in character. Under a new management, put in
office in mid-1972, a cost reduction program was initiated and, as a result,
the cost ratio was down to about 8% in 1973. Profits after provisions increased
commensurately from 2.8% in 1972 to 6.7% in 1973 (Table 7).
30.       Loans overdue at the end of October 1973 were Col$ 121,000, equal
to 8.6% of total portfolio. Ilowever, most of these overdues are repaid by
the end of the following year, and the Banco Ganadero's 1972 provision for
bad debts was Col$ 25.3 million, equal to 1.8% of its loan portfolio, which
is satisfactory.
31.       Conclusions.  Banco Ganadero appears to be an adequately run com-
mercial bank, doing useful work in financing livestock development. Management
appears sound, though there seems to he room for continued improvements in the
overall efficiency of operations. The suitability of Banco Ganadero as a bank-
ing agent for INCORA's small farmer program is open to question, however, since
its ownership and the spreads under which it operates gives the impression that
it is principally large farmer rather than small farmer oriented. Even so,



ANNEX 2
Page 8
Banco Ganadero is committed to livestock development, for wh'ch Caqueta is a
particularly favorable area. It ±s further interested in the prestige associ-
ated with participating in Government and World Bank sponsored operations,
particularly when they are successful. Thus, Banco Ganadero is likely to
continue to participate in the credit program of the proposed project. At
present, however, Banco Ganadero operates with a very narrow spread (less than
a nominal 4%) on World Bank loan funds. This spread would be increased
through raising onlending rates, to adequately compensate Banco Ganadero for
reasonable costs, and assure its full commitment to the program.
D. Agricultural Credit in Caqueta
Caia Agraria
32.       The Caja Agraria manages the largest loan portfolio in the area,
witlh a total outstanding at the end of 1973 of Col$ 134 million (Table 8).
About 10%1 of this portfolio is classified as commercial and industrial and the
remainder as agricultural. Among the agricultural loans, 12% is short term,
73% medium term and 15% long term. All long-term loans are for livestock.
The most important long-term livestock loan program in Caqueta is that supported
by the World Bank (Loan 651-CO). Disbursements under this program totalled
Col$ 6.8 million in 1973 and are expected to increase to Col$ 25 million in
1974, for an average of about Col$ 0.5 million per loan. Total loans with
delinquent payments averaged 4% of total portfolio by the end of 1973. This
delinquency ratio was reduced significantly to 2% at mid-1971 and is now the
lowest for any regional branch of Caja Agraria.
Banco Canadero
33.       Banco Canadero's portfolio in the region of Caqueta - Col$ 107
million in 1973 - contains several programs and is tile second largest agri-
cultural credit portfolio in the region. IJnder the World Bank program, carried
out in association with INCORA (Loan 739-CO), about 1,020 loans were made
averaging about Col$ 70,000 per loan witli 80% of the funds lent going for
cattle. Repayments are over 10 years, with a thiree-year grace period, at an
interest of 8% over quotas, without payment or capitalization of interest
during the grace periocd.  These interest payments correspond to a return of
6.25?: nominal on the initial loan amounlt.  Banco Ganadero's other programs,
which are for large farmers, are mature operations.
34.       Administrative costs incurred in the regional office at Florencia
and Puerto Rico have averaged 4% of all loan balances outstanding over and
above about 4% of headquarters overheads assigned to the Caqueta agencies.
Banco Ganadero employs in Caqueta 10 professionals who share with INCORA the
responsibility for drawing up farn plans, performing credit supervision and
delivering techinical assistance for joint programs. For the World Bank program,
breeding cattle are purchased from farms in Caqueta as well as on the Atlantic
c.-  by a committee comprising experts from Banco Ganadero and INCORA and
Caqtieta farmers' representatives.



ANNEX 2
Page 9
35.       There is at present no delinquency on the World Bank loan program
since this portfolio is still in the grace period. The revolving Fund program
(para 5), a program similar to that of the World Bank, had, in 1973, a ratio
of delinquent loans to loans due of 15.44%.
INCORA
36.       Although INCORA itself manages only about 20% of its total agri-
cultural credit portfolio in Caqueta, it is one of the main channels of credit
funds to the area. In 1973 it channelled to Caqueta credit for Col$ 132 mil-
lion, or 40% of the agricultural credit portfolio directly, through Central
de Cooperativas Agropecuarias Ltda (CECORA), its subsidiary, or through its
affiliated Banco Ganadero program. In 1968 INCORA's direct lendings, mainly
through the supervised credit program, (a USAID financed small farmer credit
program for which Caja Agraria is banking agent) declined significantly in
nominal terms because of the emergence of alternative sources of small farm
credit in the area, difficulties encountered in obtaining AID funds and ex-
pansion of supervised credit needs in other parts of the country. In 1973,
supervised credit loans totalling Col$ 5 million were extended to 356 families,
for an average of Col$ 14,056 per family. Since the beginning of the program,
a total of Col$ 115 million has been lent to 4,198 beneficiaries for an average
of Col$ 36,422 per loan. Credit terms depend on the type of loan but repayment
does not exceed eight years and the interest payments over quotas was 8%.
37.       Traditionally, INCORA, through the supervised credit program, assumes
responsibility for extending credit and assistance to small farmers only at the
initial stages of development. INCORA beneficiaries, when established, are
then, in principle, graduated to commercial credit institutions. In practice,
however, the graduation process is somewhat obscure. Banco Ganadero, though
a commercial institution, has assumed responsibility for lending for livestock
at the early stages of farm development and has thus provided the opportunity
to assist farmers to reach a more advanced stage. Although Caja Agraria, which
has the largest agricultural loan portfolio in the area, has the legal obliga-
tion to extend credit to INCORA graduates, the procedure has never been clearly
established. Part of the difficulty stems from legal restrictions on the terms
of Caja Agraria's loans to farmers without land title, such terms being inade-
quate for this type of lending (para 11), and INCORA's failure to coordinate
its land titling program with the credit policies of the Caja Agraria.
38.       The staff of INCORA's supervised credit program in Caqueta, composed
of 52 supervisors and nine veterinarians, draws up farm plans for recipients
of supervised credit and its affiliated programs with Banco Ganadero. It also
supervises these loans and provides most of the technical assistance received
by loan recipients.
39.       Costs.  INCORA pays a fee of 1% per annum over the balance of its
supervised credit portfolio to the Caja Agraria for all supervised credit
loans. The total costs of credit administration in Caqueta, including fees
to the Caja Agraria, are equal to approximately 13% of its total outstanding



ANNEX 2
Page 10
credit loan portfolio. These costs are slightly higher than INCORA's credit
delivery costs in the country as a whole (Annex 3) because the more difficult
terrain and tle greater geographical dispersion makes the distribution of
credit and extension services more expensive.
4n.       Defaults and Delinquencies.  Of the total portfolio of Col$ 46
million at vear-end 1973, Col$ 13 million was delinquent by more than 30 days.
Overdues amounted to Col$ 6 million, or 13% of all credit outstanding, but
supervised credit program management feels that almost all is recoverable.
Fondo Ganadero
41.       Fondo Ganadero operates in all livestock growing areas, including
the Caqueta. Of total share capital of the Caqueta Fondo Ganadero, 26% is
owned by local government agencies and 18% by INCORA. Combined public and
private sector equity ownership accounts for approximately half of all Fondo
Ganadero's resources, while the other major sources of financing are loans
from the Central Bank. The Fondo Ganadero also has access to the funds of
the FFA provided under Law 5 of 1973. The Fondo Ganadero purchases cattle in
the area of Caqueta and places them with local ranchers. Approximately 90%
of the livestock provided is breeding cattle and 10% fattening cattle. All
profits from Fondo Ganadero herds are then shared, 65% going to the farmer
and 35% to the Fund. Operations have been consistently profitable.
The Cooperativa Agropecuaria del Cagueta Ltda. (COOPERAGRO)
42.       COOPERAGRO is the largest of the affiliates of CECORA, the INCORA-
sponsored major cooperative organization in Colombia. At year-end 1973,
COOPERAGRO's total assets were Col$ 14.8 million. Cooperative member account
for approximately 90% of the share capital of the cooperative and the remainder
is contributed by INCORA.  COOPERAGRO is engaged in the sale of farm supplies
to its members, who total about 3,000 mainly small farmers. It also purchases
cattle for fattening within the Caqueta region and places them with cooperative
members with idle pasture, but because of shortage of capital, only 275 members
(8%) have benefitted from this program. One of the most attractive aspects
is the cooperative control over the sale of the fattened cattle, aimed at
protecting the member's interest. COOPERAGRO's cattle portfolio totalled
Col$ 7 million at the end of 1973, and comprised 48% of its total assets.
The profits oni cattle fattening are shared between the recipient farmer and
the coperative 60% - 40%. One-thirteenth of the recipient's 40% profit must
be contributed to the Cooperative in the form of purchases of shares. Under
and agreement between CECORA and INCORA, (October 1973), Col$ 1 million of
W4orld Bank funds (Loan 739-CO) to INCORA were transferred to the cooperative
from February to June, 1974 as a loan to finance the expansion of its cattle
portfolio. This program was halted in June 1974 because of disagreements
between CECORA andi COOPERAGRO as to the financial obligations of the latter.
It is expected that COPERAGRO will settle these debts in the near future,

thus perniu^..ng tie operation to resume. To ensure however, the continuation
of the program, INCORA would be authorized to utilize the revolving fund to
make cattle fattening loans directly to farmers, in the case the dispute
between CECORA and COOPERAGRO remains unsettled. Supply stores capacity
would be increased with CECORA, which would in due time transfer the stores
to COOPERAGRO.
43.       COOPERAGRO has expanded rapidly in the last five years, and, since
a maaagement change in 1971, has been consistently profitable in real terms.
The delinquency ratio under the cooperative's cattle fattening program is 0%.
CECORA, the parent company, believes that COOPERAGRO's fattening portfolio
can be expanded considerably without undue strain on present management re-
sources, considering INCORA's continued supervision of the program. CECORA
is also one of the leading cattle breeders in Colombia and could provide
animals for the project breeding and fattening programs.

COLOMBIA
CAQUETA LAND COLONIZATION PROJECT
Instituto Colombiano de la Reforma Agraria (INCORA)
Objectives
1.         The Instituto Colombiano de ia Reforma Agraria (Colombian Institute
for Agrarian Reform-INCORA) is an autonomous government institution established
under the Agrarian Reform Law 135 of 1961 to reform the agrarian social
structure of Colombia. Much land is inequitably concentrated in the hands
of relatively few people, while, at the other extreme, landless families are
unemployed and many smallholders are trying to farm areas which are too small
to be profitable. INCORA is responsible for bringing about a fairer dis-
tribution of land and opportunity. Where large and potentially cultivable
areas of agricultural land are being left uncultivated, or are being waste-
fully or inadequately used, INCORA is authorized to buy and develop them.
INCORA is also responsible for increasing production and productivity in rural
areas, particularly by making credit and technical services readily available
to smallholders located in its project areas. To achieve these objectives,
services are provided at a very low cost to recipients and are explicitly
considered by Government as mechanisms for transfer of subsidies.
Operations
2.         In pursuit of its objectives, INCORA initially concentrated its
efforts on land reform. However, because complementary investments were not
being provided by other institutions and in the later years because of strong
political resistance to its land reform activities, INCORA was induced to
diversify its operations considerably. Thus, it has developed a wide range
of projects (it has now about 35 under execution), including projects for
land reclamation, irrigation, land acquisition and parcelling, colonization
of unpopulated areas and consolidation of uneconomic smallholdings. It thas
promoted the issue of land titles to give farmers security of tenure and to
ensure their eligibility for credit. It has introduced supervised credit
and technical assistance to subsistence smallholders to help them develop
into commercial producers.
Organizational Setup
3.         Under INCORA's constitution, directors are chosen so that the
Board reflects broad political parity. The Minister of Agriculture is
Chairman, and the 16 members represent ICA, CAJA, IDEHA, the Geographical
Institute, farmers' associations, agricultural cooperatives, livestock
breeders, farm workers, the Catholic Church, and the Army. Two senators



ANNEX 3
Page 2
and two represenatatives of Parliament also serve.  All have two-year ter,ms.
The General MTanager is nominated hy the President of the Republic, and nis
political affiliations must be different from those of the General Manager
of Caja Agraria.
4.         There are four main departments at the head office level:  legal,
agricultural development, engineering and administration. The Colonization
Division, which is responsible for the Caqueta Projects, is under the
Department of Engineering. This organizational setup is the result of
historic development rather than of a well thought-out plan, but a reorganiza-
tion along more operational lines, taking into consideration the multiplicity
of INCORA's current operations, is being envisaged. These reorganization
plans were still undefined at the time of appraisal but the new structure is
expected to be known before loan negotiation.
5.         Total staff in 1973 was 4,710 of which 1,600, or one-third, were
professionals. INCORA salaries have been frozen at the 1971 level, and the
higlh rate of departure by professionals in the past 18 nonths has weakened
the overall organization. Somehow, the Colonization Division has succeeded
in retaining its most qualified and motivated staff and so has not been
directly affected. A salary increase of about 30% to be effective sometime
in 1974 is being envisaged and if it is accepted, professionals exodus should
be reduced. However, considerable efforts in training will be needed to
compensate for the expertise lost over the past two years.
6.         There are 28 regional offices responsible for executing programs
at regional level and approximately O3 of total personnel operate out of
them. However, most decision-making and planning is still concentrated in
INCORA's office in Bogota. Further decentralization, particularly by delegat-
ing more authority to the project managers, will be considered when higher
salaries permit recruitment of more qualified field personnel.
INCORA as a Credit Institution
7.         INCORA is reasonably efficient in lhandling its credit programs
compared to similar small farmer credit agencies in Colombia as well as in
other countries, considering that (a) INCORA engages in the provison of
credit only to small farmers at the initial stage of their development,
selecting its recipients on the basis of their developmental needs rather
than their ability to pay:  and (b) INCORA assumes mutch of the burden of
providinlg techinical assistance to recipients of bothi its own and affiliated
credit programs.
8.         Tn 1973 INCORA's total credit portfolio amounted to about Col$ 1.28
billion (Table 1). In addition to Its own supervised credit portfolio of
Col$ 847 million, financed solely from its own resources, INCORA has arranged
with the Caja Agraria and Banco Ganadero to provide banking agent services
to deliver the other credits, amounting to about Col$ 430 million, which do



ANNrX 3
Page 3
not appear in ics financial statements (para 17).  The most important Qf
these affiliated programs has been Banco Ganadero's Revolving Fund program,
under which new lendTngs stopped in 1971.
9.          In most of the affiliated programs, current expenses are shared
with the institution responsible for actual delivery. INCORA credit dlelivery
costs comprise technical assistance (80%), administration (3%) and fiduciary
services (17%) (Table 2).  Technical assistance encompasses farm planning,
the actual delivery of goods, collection and supervision, as well as an
extension service component estimated at about 20% of combined costs. Total
costs of credit delivery have been reduced consistently in real terms from
30, of total portfolio in 1964 (Tables 3 and 4) to about 7% in 1973.  The
latter costs are shown below:

(2) Total portfolio (excluding

/1    Excluding financial expenses.
INCORA anticipates that this favorable trend in cost reduction wlll be main-
tained as the cost reduction benefits of its newly emphasized group lending
approaclh are realized.
Delitnquencies
10.        The average ratio of overdues to loans ouLtstanding is 13%, about
16%/ for INCORA's supervised credit portfolio and 4, for the institutions'
affiliated programs (Table 5). This is acceptablc consi(lering the type of
farmers benefitted by these programs.  Loans in the affiliated programs tend
to be granted to recipients at a somewhat wore advanced stage of farml develop-
ment than supervised credit loans.  These differenices rather than management
differences account for the discrepant delinquency ratios between these
pro-rams.  Although overdues are significant, about 65/u are delinquent by
less than one year and only 8% are delinquent by more than two years (Table 6).
Finally, INCORA has classified Col$ 7.6 million of its own portfolio as



ANNEX 3
Page 4
unrecoverable or difficult to recover, equal to only 1% of totaL portfolio.
anv of the unrecoverable loans were those for experimental projects such
as the introduction of non-traditional crops.
Costs of other Operations
11.         General and administrative expenses, including interest expenses
of about Col$ 50 million, totalled Col$ 292 million in 1972, an increase of
about 15% over 1971 expenses in nominal terms (Table 7).  Depreciation and
bad debt reserves against the supervised credit portfolio totalled Col$105
million in 1973. General and administrative expenses, excluding financial
expenses and reserves for depreciation and bad debts, were approximately
Col$ 240 million in 1972, equal to 4.4% of total INCORA assets net of deprecia-
tion and bad debt reserves (Table 8). Accounting practices do not allow a
detailed allocation of costs per type of operation (para 17). However, these
expenses are estimated to be at about 5.5% of investments for irrigation
projects and 4%, for colonization and land redistribution projects combined.
In the Caqueta Colonization Project, where costs are higher because of the
remoteness of the area, actual administration costs amounted to about 9.9%
of investments, including a 2% allocation for headquarters overhead.
Financial Situation
12.         The majority of INCORA's financial resources are Government budgetary
allocations in the form of cash transfers, which have not increased in nominal
terms above their 1969 level of about Col$ 310 million, and highly intermittent
receipts of special Government bonds called Agrarian ISonds. Both types of
transfers are recorded as Government subscriptions of INCORA capital, which
amounted to Col$ 4 billion in 1972.
13.         Some 75, of INCORA's total current income of Col$ 126 million in
1972 came from interest on INCORA's agrarian bonds portfolio. Interest pay-
ments on the supervised credit portfolio and water and land use fees in
irrigation districts are the other principal income sources. Charges on both
these programs (4`' on the credit program because of cleferred interest payments,
and 2%i' of total irrigation district assets) are inade(quate to cover current
costs.  Thus, INCORA generates no funds internally but operates at a current
loss, which amounts to Col$ 165 million, or 3% of total assets in 1972 (Col$ 270
million after depreciation and bad debts withidrawii).  Thferefore, Government
transfers are in part used to cover INCORA current deficits which re~fLects
Government's use of INCORA as a channiel for providirug subsidies.
Cash Fiow
14.         INCORA has increased its cash receipts from  credit sources from
Col$ 184.4 million in 1969 to Col$ 253.6 million in 1973. Hlowever, credit
sources other than the World Bank have been in decline. World Bank disburse-
ments increased from Col$ 1.6 million in 1969 to Col$ 176.1 million by 1973,
equal to almost 707% of total cash receipts from cre(it sources in that year.
Total cash receipts have apparently remained below  Lotal stated expenses,
altliough accounting methods do not permit a detailed assessment of the exact
anlual sources and uses of funds.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
15.        During the period 1969-73, the price level has approximately doubled,
and the plateauing of INCORA's cash inflows has placed the institution under
severe financial strain. Salaries have been frozen, personnel eliminated.
The Government has supported INCORA during this period through large transfers
of agrarian bonds, principally in 1972. However, although these transfers
substantially increase assets, they only moderately alleviate the institution's
cash flow problems. The principal use of these bonds is for the acquisition
of lands for development. INCORA, then, has been provided in recent years
with the bond portfolio it needs to accelerate land acquisition, but it has
starved for cash income sources to, not only develop new projects, but also
to maintain the soundness of its continuing operations.
16.        Although INCORA expects the situation to improve in 1974, there
is no indication that this will be the case, unless Government gives stronger
financial support to INCORA's developmental role. Since foreign-financed
projects are receiving priority for the allocation of available funds, no
lack of Government contribution to Bank projects is expected in the future,
provided the overall lending program channelled through INCORA remains at
a reasonable size. However, if INCORA's budgetary problem is not improved,
there is serious (langer of seeing the institution as a whole dwindle away.
Accounts and Audits
17.        Accounting practices follow the general procedure of the Ministry
of Agriculture. These, however, are inadequate and do not permit detailed
analysis. There is a need for clarification of concepts employed in the so-
called cash accounts for restructuring income statements separating financial
from non-financial items, current from investment expenditures, and cash from
accrual accounts. Furthermore, affiliated credit operations should be fully
accounted for. Finally, INCORA should also fulfill its legal obligation under
the various loan and project agreements for World Bank as well as IDB's
projects, to set up separate project accounts.
Conclusions
is.        INCORA's operations were reviewed in 1967 by a Bank/FAO mission,
which concluded that the agency was operating satisfactorily, and indications
are that INCORA's efficiency in key sectors has improved since. INCOR(A is
indeed operating efficiently in its owl field and would be the most suitable
organization in Colombia to implement the propose(d project, provided Government
financial support is adequate.

CAQUETA RIJRAL SETTLEMENT PROJECT (PI[ASE II)
Forestry and Erosion
A. Background
Introduction
1.         Erosion problems in the Amazon Basin caused by its human coloniza-
tion is receiving increasing attention, and the Colombian authorities have
proposed the inclusion of a forestry and erosion control component in the
project. The authorities' concern about the possible adverse consequences
of the spontaneous and uncontrolled colonization movement in this area en-
compasses the aspects of timber supply and conservation as affected by soil
erosion and changes in the hydrological system. It shouid be stressed that
in Caqueta, the colonization process has as yet not caused timber shortages
and that except in the Cordillera, there are currently no serious erosion
or hydrological problems. However, concern about future development of these
problems is justified and successful precautionary measures taken now would
prevent the necessity of more costly remedial action in the future.
Vegetation
2.         The natural vegetation in the area is a humid tropical forest rmade
up of a miixture of about 250 species without any particuiar predominant type.
Inventory studies show that these forests are poorly stocked with commercial
woods and are not economically exploitable other than by the independent pit-
sawyers who are currently operating in the area. Nevertheless, Government
has high hopes of eventual commercial operations in these forests. Further
details about their market value are given in Appendix 1.
Conservation Problems
3.         Although the airea under consideration forTms one physiographical
unit, there are three subareas, in which differetnt erosion problemas have been
identified: the Cordillera hills, the foothills and the lowlands.
4.          Thie Cordillera.  The portion of the Cordiilera bordering Caqueta
forms the c1tcihIlIent of 1'0ost rivers flowing through the project area, and, thus,
although it is not located within tlhc so-calLed Caqueta Colonization perimeter,
its water suipply influenced bv the agricultural activities in the hillis in turn
inifluetices the water supply of the project area.  Soils in the Cordiliera area
are sandy and prone to land slides.  Because of population pressures, settlers
in this area clear the forest on increasingly steeper slopes to establish



ANNEX 4
Page 2
pasture on wihich overgrazing is frequent.  The soil exposure under the high
rainfall conditions (about 3.5 m/year) creates a serious threat to the
hydrological balance downstream in additioni to local erosion problems.  In
this area, stopping deforestation and introducing partial reforestation is
a necessity.
5.         The Foothills.  The foothills form a transitional zone between the
Cordillera and the Amazon. Soils have a loose structure and high clay content,
making them susceptible to erosion, particularly with the undulating topo-
graphy. They are already fully settled and, to a large extent, transformed
into pasture. The most serious manifestation of potential erosion on farms
would be caused by overgrazing, which is generalized, but has in only a few
cases reached the stage of gully formations. Rivers in this zone are subject
to severe silting, which amplifies their meandering on the flatter areas.
Silting is partly due to malpractices in the Cordillera, but much is caused
by scouring of the river banks, rendered loose and unstable by the removal
of trees along river courses, the initial step usually taken by farmers when
they start to develop their farms. Silted rivers an(d blocked channels cannot
accommodate the increased flow caused by the runoff from pastures, which is
more rapid and of greater volume than from the original forest. Although
from a purely erosion control standpoint, the most appropriate measure might
be the partial reforestation of the area, under current conditions, this
proposal cannot be generalized because it is of uncertain economic justific-
ation and would be unenforceable because of likely farmer resistance. Alter-
native measures, including better pasture management and tree plantings along
river banks, would be undertaken under the project.
6.         The Lowlands.  There is currently no localized erosion danger in the
low-lands, where forest still covers large areas. In the absence of sufficient
scientific studies on the subject, it is generally accepted that, provided
farm development is restricted to suitable soils and topography and that
judiciously located forest strips are maintained (i.e., along the rivers),
serious local erosion problems can be avoided. lowever, the progressive
clearance over large areas of the forest cover that provides an absorptive
layer for the highl rainfall (between 2 and 4 mn/year) will cause changes in
the quantities and periodicity of surface water runoff being discharged in
the rivers, creating over the entire Amazon basin a potential threat of
alternate floods and water shortages. The experience in the fooothilis shows
that farmers clear most of their landi (para 5) an.l therefore the only way to
maintain some forest cover, would be to establish Covernment-controlled forest
reserves.  Such reserves could be establishie(d in thc lowlands, the only part
of the project area still covered withi somne forest.
Legal Status
7.          Ihle Caqueta project area was originaily part of the officially
declared 1/ "Amazon Forest Reserve," which is considered a "Protective Forest
1/    Article 1 of Law 2 of 1959.



Page 3
Zone." Successive resolutions 1/ extracted the area from this reserve wita
the explicit objective of opening it to colonization. The law 2/ requires
recipients of more than 50 ha of public lands to keep 20% under forest and
it allows Government to maintain 10% of the area as a protective zone.  This
farmers' obligation has, however, proven impossible to enforce and, as a
matter of fact, impractical because of the lack of means to ensure that
farmers place these individual reserves in judicious iocations, where they
would have the expected erosion control effect. Experience on fully developed
farm shows that, on average, settlers maintain not more than 5% of their iand
under forest for the protection of a spring or the supply of fencing and
housing wood.
INDERENA
S.         The Instituto de Desarrollo de los Recursos Naturales Renovables
(INDERENA) was created by Decree No. 2420 of 1968 as a public agency within
the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. It is responsible for
the regulation, administration and development of the natural resources in
the country. INDERENA operates through a Board of Directors, presided over
by the Minister of Agriculture, and a General Manager who conducts its
programs through six departments at headquarters --four technical, a legal
and an administrative -- and six regional offices. In 1973 the agency comprised
about 72 professionals, 28 of whom are working at headquarters on forestry
studies within the forestry department (the main technical department). The
agency is funded principally through government budgetary allocations and for
a small part through timber royalties. In 1973, INDERENA's budget was
Col$ 141.5 million (US$5.66 million), Col$ 23 million (US$0.92 million) of
which was allocated to the Forestry Department.
9.         Since budgetary allocations are insufficient, INDERENA has not been
the hoped for tool to implement Government's policies on exploitation and
conservation of renewable natural resources. So far, INDERIENA has concentrated
its meager resources on studies and has been particularly weak in implementing
programs. INDERENA's sectional office in Florencia, for instance, counts only
two forestry engineers and three inspectors and no transportation facilities
to control the 9 million ha of the Caqueta Intendencia.
B. Project Proposals
The Cordillera Hills
10.        The technical solutions to the erosion problems in the Cordillera
hills would be quite simple: no deforestation on slopes of more than 20%
declivity and reforestation of those already cleared and of river banks;
1/    Resolution No. 015 of 1963, No. 141 of 1964 and No. 216 of 1965.
2/    Articles 14 and 15 of special Decreec No. 2278 of 1953.

basic works to stop erosion where it has become pernicious; and farners' tech-
nical assistance to improve pasture management. Ilowever, this would imply that
settlement in the area would be forbidden and farmers with insufficient land
on gentle slopes would be moved to less erosion-prone areas. Such measures
would have socio-economic implications which are still unquantified and re-
quire further studies before a project could be initiated. The objective
of such studies would be to define the most judicious way of applying the
proposed technical measures, minimizing the unfavorable socio-economic
consequences and selecting pilot project areas totalling about 50,000 ha
where the proposals could be tried out. The areas selected should include
several typical water sheds where the initially recommended measures would
be applicable and have a demonstrating effect. If successful, this project
could then be expanded over the 300,000-ha affected area within the Caqueta
Intendencia, or, eventually, all along similarly affected zones in the Cordil-
lera.
11.       The recommended studies would be multi-disciplinary, involving
soil reconnaissance, study of land use patterns, assessment of the status of
erosion and socio-economic analysis. It would be partly based on aerial
photographs that were taken in 1973. This nine-month study would be prepared
by INDERENA, with Instituto Geographico "Agustin Codazzi" (IGAC) and, prin-
cipally, ICA and INCORA's assistance.
The Foothills
12.       In the foothills, the erosion problem is mainly one of pasture
management. To reduce the risk of erosion, in particular the formation of
gullies, an effective extension service should be established to promote
better pasture management techniques, including a wider use of grass varieties
that provide a denser soil coverage. Provision for such an intensified esz-
tension service would be included in the project and is discussed in Annex
10. It is also recommended that strips of forest be planted along river courses;
studies are required to determine the most appropriate tree varieties and
variety trials would be initiated in the forest reserve as well as on selected
farms in the foothills. Furthermore, the steepest slopes (e.g., more than 300)
should also in time and progressively be replanted with trees for protection.
Prolonged clean cultivation should not be practiced on any slope, and on more
gentle slopes under pasture it is advisable to apply simple soil conservation
and anti-erosion measures, e.g., introduction of strips of herbaceous vegetation
along contours.
13.       The most spectacular form of erosion (gullying and land slides)
is found on the cut and embankment of newly constructed roads. In time,
but usually after costly damage to the road and adjacent farms, tthe problem
corrects itself, but a few elementary precautions, including the plantation
of a local grass and avoidance of construction cuts and embankments with
excessively steep slopes, would significantly reduce the problem. Such
precautions would be taken by INCORA in building project roads.



ANNEX 4

Forest Reserve
14.       Within the project area limits, the only block of forest free of
human intervention and of sufficient size to be controllable, covers about
25,000 ha in the southern part of the Caqueta-Orteguaza rivers triangle
(Mtap 11000). To avoid conflicts and ensure a reasonable chance of success,
the boundaries of the reserve should be kept well away from currrent settle-
ments and thus it is recommended that, for these practical reasons, the
reserve be limited to one block of about 20,000 ha.
15.       The area corresponds to about 1.7% of the project area, or far less
than the recommended size from a conservation point of view. However, this
is the last block of forest of significant size still available in the area,
and the only one currently identified as a potential reserve. The establish-
ment of a reserve in this area would have advantages other than conservation.
It would be the first opportunity for INI)ERENA to test the application of
protective measures of forest reserves in the Amazon against settlers'
incursion, and it would also give a chance to investigate ways of managing
and improving the forest resources of the area and study the effects of the
change of vegetation on the environment. Little or no information on either
of these aspects is at present available. This reserve could be further
considered as the first in a system of reserves to be established in the
still untouched areas farther downstream. This and future reserves would
represent lasting examples of the original vegetation after the entire area
has been settled and may yet serve as valuable sources of plant gene material.
For Colombia, as for other Andean countries, this consideration is particularly
important since the natural vegetation of the area represents a narrow stretch
of transition formations between those in the elevated Andes and those in
the lower Amazon basin.
16.       INDERENA should, with INCORA's assistance and before the felling
season starting in September 1974, survey the boundaries of the reserve,
demarcate the area with a 5-m wide path and mark it with posts. The demarcat-
ed area should be proclaimed a forest reserve and legallv transferred 1/ from
INCORA to INDERENA for preservation and management.  Shifts of six guards
with assistants should be established, with housing facilities and animal
transportation, to permanentlv guard the area.
17.       As soon as possible after the reserve is established, INDERENA
should begin the program of investigations outlined in Appendlx 2.  This
program would include surveys to identify areas suitable for establishing
future reserves located deeper in the Amazon Basin. Investment and operating
costs of this program are given in Table 1 and 2.

Forest Exploitation
1.        Two studies have been made to determine the potential of commercial
forest exploitation in Caqueta: a forest inventory by INDERENA; and a trial
by Industrias Forestales S. A.
Forest Type
2.        According to INDERENA's forest inventory, dominant trees in the
Caqueta Project area attain heights of 25 to 35 m and a diameter at breast
height of up to 60 cm. There is little stratification, with only occasionally
herbaceous and scrubby understory. Based principallv an physiographic criteria,
the forests have been classified in two broad categories:
(a) forests on swampy or alluvial flats, which are characterized by
poor drainage and varying frequencv of flooding. These forests
carry, a limited number of tree species. In worse conditions,
palm (Canaguchal) forms pure stands, while areas only periodically
inundated carry such valuable species as sangretoro (Virola Spp)
and bilibil (Guarea trichiliodes).
(b) forests on low hills and terraces, which are characterized by
better drainage, although on flat terraces external drainage
may still be poor and internal drainage impeded. These
forests are floristically rich and contain the largest number
of commercial species, including, besides the sangretoro, the
caimo (Pouteria spp), amarillo (Nectandira spp), achapo
(Cedrelinga Cortaenefermis), comino (Aniba perutilis) and
cedro (Cedrela spp).
Corqmercial Value
3.        The forests are considered to be poorlv stocked with commercial
woods. On average, 25 trees per ha have breast height diameter of 40 cm or
more. On average, their total volume is 71 m3/ha, of whlich 17 m3 (24%) are
marketable on the local markets and 29 m3 (40%) have a potential value as
fence posts or for charcoal but are currently not use(I because of saturation
of demand, the remaining 36% having no commercial value.

Exploitation
4.        The deforested area within project boundaries is currently estimated
at 500,000 ha.  It is estimated too, that some 30,000 ha of forests in the
project area are burned and cleared annually, representing a total vol ume
of approximately 2.2 million m3 of timber, of which only about 1% is sawn
and sold. Exploitation is very rudimentary and undertaken almost exclusively
bv licensed as well as illegal 'pit-sawyers" who cream forests far ahead of
the settlers. The sawyers convert the trees manuallv at the stump int-o blocks
(0.1 x 0.3 x 3 m). Because of poor accessibility, transport is by hand or
animals (i.e. about 10 km/day) to the nearest river. Thus, movement is both
slow and relatively expensive, and only the more durable and valuable species,
e.g., cedro, are hauled out over the long distances. Labor plus transporta-
tion to riverside costs on average Col$ 255/m3 but in some cases, up to
Col$ 330/m3. Hence, under current conditions, exploitation is quite unat-
tractive, except for domestic use by the settler or for the high value species.
5.        The trial on 1 ha by a private company (Industrias Forestales S.A.)
demonstrated that it is possible to obtain more complete utilization by
producing charcoal and fence-posts in addition to sawn blocks. As yet,
there are no markets for fence-posts or charcoal close to the project area
since farmers obtain these items through clearing their own land. The study
further points out that exploitation should be undertaken as a planned opera-
tion before the settlers begin to clear their plots. Given that colonization
in the project area is spontaneous and uncoordinated and widely dispersed on
a generally broken terrain, without access save by rivers, it is considered
quite impractical, if not impossible, to rationalize the felling at the pre-
sent stage of development of the Caqueta project. Whatever benefits could
be obtained from a rationalized forest exploitation should be weighed against
the delays it would cause in developing the area througli spontaneous coloniza-
tion. The trial shows that, under these conditions, the rationalized forest
exploitation would not be economic.

Outline of Forestry Research and Studies
Research
1.         Applied research to be conducted in the Forest Reserve would be
unpretentious and aimed at producing results of practical application. The
program would consist primarily of variety trails for determining the best
species to be implanted along river banks and for commercial forest exploita-
tion, either on individual farms or on Government-controlled reserves. An
experimental nursery would be established on a half hectare for raising
seedlings of both native and exotic species. The suitability of the species
produced in the nursery should be tested thereafter, both in the reserve
and on experimental plantations with individual farmers or on the ICA
Demonstration Center at Macagual/Maguare. On the reserve, pilot plantations,
principally of exotic species, should be initiated on an area of 1 or 2 ha
as from the third year. Investigations regarding the improvement of the
natural forests by substituting low value species with those of known com-
mercial value should cover about 4 ha. Both systems of line and of group
plantings would be studied, each on 2-ha plots, starting with the first and
simpler method.
Outline of survey to Intensify New Forest Reserves
2.         The objective is to obtain information on the composition and
content of the non-accessible belt of forest lying to the southeast of
the Caqueta project area, with the aim of establishing a second forest
reserve. The studies should cover approximately 100,000 ha of forest lying
between the Caqueta and Caguan Rivers, southeast of an imaginary line joining
Solano and Carthagena (Map 11000).
3.         The studies would include:
(a)  aerial reconnaissance an(d ground inspection of an area
larger than the suggested 100,000 ha to determine ground
conditions and to select an area to be inventoried; and
(b)  undertake a general inventory (intensity 0.26%) of the
selected area to provide inter ali;t avcrnge volumes of
timber, specific composition, and (lefirlition of forest
type.



ANNEX 4
Appendix 2
Page 2
The studies would be conducted directly by INDERENA or under a subcontract
and last about 18 months.
4.          On the basis of the information collected, INDERENA would locate
a second reserve. Because of the increasing rate of advance of the settlers,
time is of the essence, lest the opportunity be lost.

CAQUETA RURAL SETTLEMENT PROJECT (PHASE II)
Land Tenure and Livestock Credit for Breeding and Fattening Cattle
Land Tenure
1.        From the latest data (1971) and information collected in the field,
the mission established a land tenure pattern, and, with the experience gained
in Phase I, it served as a basis for establishing the criteria determining the
type of farmers that would directly benefit from the project. According to
this information, about 3,200 new families, with an additional area of about
160,000 ha, have settled in the last three years. It is estimated that about
2,000 of the new settlers fall in the 50- to 100-ha bracket, 800 in the 40-
to 50-ha bracket, and the rest, about 400, have established farms smaller than
40 ha. The land tenure pattern in 1971 and the present situation are presented
in the table below:

Long-term On-farm Development Credit
2.        Farm budget studies and experience during Phase I further show that
average farmers with less than 30 ha do not obtain sufficient net income with
their current technology to make them want to establish themaelves permanently
on their farms. These settlers usually sell out their land, capitalizing on
their development efforts, and seek larger areas farther into the forest.
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that an average initial herd of one
bull and 10 cows is the minimum necessary to build up a viable livestock
operation. Finally it has been estimated arbitrarily that about 60% of all



ANNEX 5
Page 2
settlers with 30 to 200 ha farms would seek, and be eligible to receive, a
project subloan. This would allow a total of about 2,500 farmers to receive
a Phase II project loan, in addition to the 1,700 beneficiaries of Phase I,
or a total of 4,200 settler families for both phases combined.

Within this framework, three types of loans have been chosen as representative
of the project. Models I and II represent settlers who would receive one single
loan under the program. Model III-1 represents settlers who have received an
initial loan in Phase I of the project (15 breeding cows is the current average)
and would receive a second loan in Phase II. Finally, Model III-2 represents
settlers who would receive two loans under the Phase II project.
3.        In total, about 2,850 settlers would benefit from the Phase II
project: about 350 settlers that received a loan in Phase I would receive
a second one in Phase II, and about 2,500 new settlers (of which some 350
would receive two loans) would receive their first loans under this project.
4.        When the number and type of proposed loans are considered in the
context of the land tenure pattern, it may be observed that one-third (1,500)
of the farms (some 4,500 farms) around 50 ha (from 30 to 80 ha) and less than
half (1,350) of those (some 3,350 farms) around 100 ha (from 80 to 200 ha)
would be directly reached by Phase II of the project.
5.        Sixteen tables have been prepared to formulate farm plans and
analvze the financial position of the beneficiaries (Tables 1 to 16). Basic
assumptions regarding technical aspects are spelled out in the tables themselves.
As for the financial matters, loan repayment hias been scheduled in accordance
with the formula currently used by Banco Ganadero (interest is charged on the
amortization of principal, rather than on outstanding debt), adapted to the
terms set forth in Law 5 (12 years, including a three year grace period) and
withi an interest rate of 15%. A significant difference has een introduced,
however, while interest during the grace period Is presently waived in
Colombia, it lhns been capitalized on a linea;r interest basis.  Thus, the new

rate is equivalent to more than double the current effective rate (6.25%).
The schedule of repayment as it would be calculated by Banco Ganadero for
various rates is presented below:

Cattle Fattening Program
6.        The credit operations of Cooperativa Agropecuaria del Caqueta Ltda.
(C0oPERAGRO) and its ongoing cattle fattening program are discussed in Annex 2.
COOPERAGRO purchases young animals (about 18 months old, 200 kg liveweight and
places them with farmers for fattening for about 20 months. Under Phase I,
a total of about 270 loans would be made at a cost of Col$ 10.0 million
(US$400,000). The program would continue under Phase II at an expected rate
of about 200 operations per year, each consisting of a lot of about 15 head.

CAQUETA RURAL SETTLEMENT PROJECT (PHASE II)
Road Construction Costs
1.        Project roads would be of two types -- B and B/C -- and be built
according to the following general design standards, which were applied
satisfactorily under the Phase I project:
Class of Road
B        B/C
Right of Way (m)                     40        40
Embankment Width (m)                  6         5
Gravelled Surface (m)                 4         4
Width of Structures                   Single Lane
Design Speed (km/hr)                 40        30
Under the Phase I project, C type roads, with only 4-m-wide embankments, had
also been envisaged, but because they were found to be impractical for the
type of machinery and vehicles operating in the area, they were replaced by
B/C type roads.
2.        In addition to the above mentioned general standards mentioned, the
following specifications would be in force to ensure better protection of proj-
ect roads against erosion, which has affected Phase I roads:
(a). side slopes would not exceed the ratio of 1:1;
(b)  cuts over 2.5 m long would be designed in steps;
(c)  the number of culverts would average five per km;
(d)  the diameter of culverts over 8 m long would be at least
90 cm;
(e)  the length of side ditches on the top of hills would
not exceed 50 m;
(f)  the longitudinal curvature in cuts at the top of hills
would be about 500 m in radius;



ANNEX 6
Page 2
(g) the profile gradient in cuts would be at least 2.5%; and
(h) the cross-section gradient would be at least 2%.
These specifications have been included in the last road construction con-
tracts signed under the Phase I project and INCORA would continue to require
them in future contracts. Additional construction costs to comply with these
specifications are estimated at Col$ 45,000 per km for both B and B/C road
types. INCORA would also continue to require that grass be planted on road
cuts and embankments as a further protection against erosion.
3.        Construction costs in general are high in Caqueta for the following
main reasons:
(a) the only access to the area is via the Garzon-Florencia
mountainous road, which is in poor condition and especially
difficult and hazardous to traverse with heavy equipment;
(b) supply of basic materials such as cement, steel and gasoline
is irregular, requiring construction firms to carry unusually
large stocks:
(c) nine months of heavy rains hinder several operations which
can be carried out only during the dry season;
(d) white clay, which disintegrates wlhen uncovered, underlies
the more workable red clay in many areas; the detailed soil
surveys which would be needed to determine the location of
these white clay layers would be very costly in the tropical
forest environment;
(e) the rolling topography requires considerable earth moving;
and
(f) gravel is found only in the foothills and has to be
transported an average distance of over 50 km.
4.        Costs of the two types of project roads are given in the Tables 1
and 2 and in Annex 8, Table 4.

CAQUETA RURAL SETTLEMENT PROJECT (Phase II)
Education and Health Programs
A. Education Programs
1.        Primary education in Caqueta has grown proportionately to popula-
tion during the last 13 years. There were approximately 5,000 students and
200 teachers in 1961, while in 1974, there were approximately 42,000 students
and 1,700 teachers. Presently, the annual increase in students is of the order
of 5,000 to 6,000 and the number of teachers is increasing at around 200 a year.
Not only are the number of facilities, insufficient, but the quality of educa-
tion in Caqueta could also be made better by:
(a) improving the quality of teachers through more effective
training; and
(b) making teaching materials available to the schools since
most schools have no teaching materials whatsoever.
The Ministry of Education is improving teacher training and plans to intensify
its program by constructing Rural Education Centers. The project would in-
clude provision for purchase of materials and adult education.
Concentraciones de Desarrollo Rural (Rural Education Centers)
2.        This is a new approach being implemented in Colombia.  The basic
premise of the program is "to integrate education, agriculture, health and
community development so that external economies, as well as economies of
scale, could be achieved resulting in greater social and economic returns
for the public expenditures."
3.        In the area of education, the concept includes the construction
of a central unit for approximately 400 to 600 students with grades from 6
to 9 and including boarding facilities. The central units are linked to the
"Escuelas Satelites" (1st to 5th grades) and these to the "Escuelas Vinculadas"
(1st to 3rd grades). The first phase of the program (1974-76) contemplates
the creation of 54 "concentraciones," 13 of which will be financed by Bank
Loan 920-CO. Two "concentraciones" are planned for Caqueta: one in Manrique,
which will be operating in 1974, and the other in San Vicente, scheduled for
a future date. At the present time, there are only four "concentraciones"
operating in the country.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
4.        Although the concept of these rural development centers are a step
in the right direction to adapt curricula to local conditions, there is cur-
rently not enough experience to generalize them. However, the existing centers
should be used to experiment with improving local school programs by integrat-
ing the neighboring primary schools in the rural development school program.
If the concept of these centers proves successful, it could be supported in
future projects.
Education Program to be Included in the Project
5.        A German educational mission, which has been working in Colombia
for several years, assisted by a team of Colombian education specialists,
has developed a set of materials to teach reading, arithmetic, geography,
and a few other subjects such as music, physical education, and nutrition.
The budget of the Ministry of Education for 1974 calls for 50 of these sets
to go to Caqueta. This kind of material would make a significant impact
on the quality of education and each school should have one. Approximately
500 sets would be required in the project area by the beginning of the next
school year (February 1975). The head of the German Mission, as well as the
Coordinator of Education for Caqueta, indicated that they would send the
necessary personnel to Caqueta to instruct the teachers as to how to use
the materials effectively so that full benefits could be realized.
6.        Further assistance could be provided by ACPO (Accion Cultural Po-
pular). This is a private institution, linked to the Catholic Church, which
has specialized in non-formal education of rural people through lessons given
by radio and with the help of local volunteers. It is a professional organi-
zation, highly regarded in Colombia, and it is presently collaborating with
the Ministry of Education in the new "Concentraciones de Desarrollo Rural."
7.        ACPO's services could be utilized under the project in two specific
ways:
(a) To supply the 500 rural primary schools in the Caqueta Project
area with a collection of 24 volumes that the institution
published, entitled "Biblioteca del Campesino."
(b) To provide courses. At the present time, ACPO has programmed
a total of 13 short courses (three days' duration) in the
Caqueta, dealing with leadership, group dynamics, functions
of State agencies (INCORA, INDERENA, IDEMIA), social partici-
pation (in the communities), and further available training.
In the latter, emphasis is placed on familiarizing partici-
pants, with the teaching methods followed by ACPO in its radio
schools - Radio Zutatenza - to motivate participants to either
enroll in the schools or to serve as volunteers to help others
learn to read and write.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
ACPO is willing to accept responsibility for providing 15 additional courses,
with an average of 30 participants each, in Caqueta every year. The cost of
these courses would include funds to pay a per diem to each participant. ACP0
would provide instructors out of its own resources.
8.        Costs of the education programs to be included in the projects, in
addition to the primary schools to be constructed, are given in Table 1.
B. Health Programs
9.        Through its section in Caqueta, the Servicio Nacional de Erradicacion
de la Malaria (SEM) is conducting a malaria eradication campaign in the project
area. To be effective, however, eradication must reach a 90% level, since
anything less causes a rapid recurrence of infestations. In addition to the
fact that SEM's section in Caqueta frequently had insufficient products to
cover the rapidly increasing population, certain villages have resisted SEM's
activities because of the lethal effects of DDT on house animals. If no
action is taken, malaria cases will continue to fluctuate between 2,500 and
9,000 per year. With the project, these extremes could be reduced by between
70% and 90% (number of cases varying between 250 and 2,700). Total cost of
the operation would be Col$ 25.50 million, of which the Col$ 11.0 million
would go for incremental salaries and Col$ 14.5 million for imported equip-
ment and materials, including Col$ 9.0 million for Baygon, a substitute pro-
duct for DDT.
10.       Instituto Nacional de Programas Especiales de Salud (INPES) is a
dynamic organization within the Ministry of Health which constructs water
supply and sewerage systems in rural centers. Water quality is particularly
poor in Caqueta, with supplies usually being taken from rivers and distri-
buted without treatment, while sewerage systems are usually non-existent
in frontier towns. Parasitism is considered to be a major cause of infant
mortality in Caqueta (surveys show 100% of the children and 80% of the adults
having some sort of intestial parasit). Under the project, INPES would im-
prove the water supply system of 10 rural centers and install sewerage
systems in nine rural centers. It would also provide 78 primary schools
with wells and pumps and 12 primary schools with sanitary units. These im-
provements are expecially necessary in schools constructed prior to the
Phase I project, when such facilities were not automatically included.
Costs of the various components are shown in the following table:

11.       Under- and mal-nutrition are by far the most serious health problems
in Caqueta.  The Caqueta Seccional de Salud, the local representative of the
Ministry of Health, has initiated a nutrition program in 13 localities through
the schools and health centers, but because of lack of coordination, lack of
interest by the settlers, and inadequate support in the form of products from
the Ministry, the system works poorly. Furthermore, the Instituto Colombiano
de Bienestar Familiar (ICBF) which sponsors this effort is reconsidering
its nutrition programs to take into account the considerable cuts in foreign
aid (mainly PL480 and CARE). Since it is felt that to be effective, the
program would require changes at the national level that exceed the scope
of this project, any effort along these lines would be better included under
)the national nutrition and population project currently under consideration
'by the Bank.

CAQUETA RURAL SETTLEMENT PROJECT (PHASE II)
Institutional Arrangements
1.         INCORA (Annex 3) would be responsible for project implementation
(chart 8680). It would be directly in charge of constructing roads with the
assistance of consultants, and health and administrative facilities. Other
activities would be implemented through the appropriate agencies under agree-
ments to be approved by the Bank. Agencies already operating satisfactorily
under the ongoing Caqueta project are Banco Ganadero (Annex 2) for the long-
term cattle credit program, Instituto Colombiano de Construcciones Escolares
(ICCE) for the school construction program and the Ministries of Education
and of Health for the operation of completed facilities. CECORA signed an
agreement in October 1973 for the execution of the cattle fattening program
(Annexes 2 and 5). Other main components, such as the road maintenance,
forestry and technical assistance programs, would be carried out through
agencies which do not have as yet a specific agreement with INCORA. These
agencies and their specific responsibilities under the proposed project are
outlined below.
Complementary Road-Works, and Road Maintenance Fondo Nacional de Caminos Vecinales
2.         During the Phase I project, considerable difficulties were encoun-
tered with the road maintenance program Caminos Vecinales was to carry out.
Since INCORA would be responsible for constructing project roads and would
be a major user of roads constructed during both Phases I and II, it would
also be responsible for complementary road-works required during the three
to four years after the initial construction contract is terminated. Com-
plementary road-works would include additional culverts, realignments, addi-
tion of gravel and further compactation. Although INCORA has occasionally
provided road maintenance in its colonization projects, it is not officially
responsible for this activity, and specific Government approval would be
required to allow INCORA to make budgetary allocations for such operations.
3.         Caminos Vecinales has been in operation since 1962, but its current
structure and activities are determined by Article 4 of Law 64 of 1967 and
Decree No. 3160 of December 1968. It was set up as a public organization
with its own capital and made administratively autonomous. Its objectives
are to construct, rehabilitate and maintain roads of regional character in



ANNEX 10
Page 2
accordance with general plans established by the Ministry of Public Works
(Ministerio de Obras Publicas - MOP) with authorization of the Departmental
authorities. Caminos Vecinales is directed by a Board of seven members,
including the Ministers of Public Works and Agriculture. Its M4anaging
Director is nominated directly by the President of the Republic. Caminos
Vecinales is organized in two main departments, Engineering and Administra-
tion, and 25 regional offices. In Caqueta, Caminos Vecinales regional office
is in charge of constructing and maintaining two roads (El Paujil-Cartagena
and Mlontanita-Milan, M4ap 11000) under an IDB-financed project. Construction
of these roads was stopped in 1972 because of non-compliance by the contract-
ors, but plans allow for resuming work in 1974. In 1973, Caminos counted
166 professionals among a total of 550 staff members and no increase in staff
is envisaged for 1974. Its 1972/73 budget 1/ amounted to about Col$ 400 mil-
lion. The three main contributors are: the National Government, which pro-
vided Col$ 270 million (68%) from a tax on gasoline; the Department authorities,
about Col$ 90 million (22%) from a tax on beer sales; INCORA, about Col$ 17
million (67%) from its budgetary allocations; and several other outside
agencies combined Col$ 26 million (6%). Under Article 21 of its statutes,
Caminos Vecinales is authorized to contract with outside entities.
4.        Although it is called an autonomous agency, Caminos vecinales has
remained under the tight control of the Minister of Public Works, who has
considerable authority over its operations under several articles of the
agency's statutes 2/. The main restriction imposed on Caminos vecinales has
resulted from the fact that MIOP channels government budgetary allocations
through Fondo Vial Nacional, an agency within MOP. This agency, which is
responsible for national highways, is usually short of funds and has often
delayed transmitting those allocated to Caminos Vecinales. Thus, Caminos
Vecinales' most successful operations have been implemented under direct
contracts with government entities outside MOP. During 1972/73, it constructed
a total of 849 km of roads, 11.4 km of which were in Caqueta. Partly because
of MOP's and the Departmental authorities' general policies and partly be-
cause of lack of funds, Caminos Vecinales has done little in road maintenance.
5.        Under an agreement to be concluded with Caminos Vecinales, INCORA
would supply it with complementary machinery. The machinery would remain
INCORA's property but would be used under specified conditions by Caminos
vecinales to upgrade and maintain project roads. INCORA would provide funds
to operate this machinery as well as Caminos Vecinales own machinery 3/ sta-
tioned in the area. Project machinery would be maintained by Caminos Vecinales.
1/   Caminos Vecinales' accounting year is July 1 to June 30.
2/   Articles 4, 8 (a), (b), (d) and 15 (f).
3/   This equipment comprised in 1973 two bulldozers, one motograder, one
vibrating roller, one wheel tractor one loader and three dumpers. This
equipment would be augmented by four dumpers to be purchased in 1974 for
the specific purpose of maintaining project roads.



ANNEX 10
Page 3
Funds would be paid out according to the number of kilometers of project roads
upgraded and maintained to standards established by INCORA and Caminos Vecinales,
in consultation with the Bank. Caminos Vecinales is now represented in Caqueta
by only three professionals, but under the agreement, it would progressively
strengthen this staff as from 1975.
Forestry and Erosion Control Programs and INDERENA
6.        This project component and INDERENA are discussed in Annex 4.
Annual plans of operations would be prepared by INCORA's Colonization Divi-
sion and INDERENIAts Forestry Department in consultation with the agencies'
local representatives in Florencia. INCORA's Project Manager would be re-
sponsible for the implementation of this component, with authority over a
forestry engineer, to be appointed by INDERENA to head its staff involved
in the project. INDERENA's forestry engineer would participate in the plan-
ning of technical assistance programs to improve pasture management (para 7),
which are related to erosion control and in the selection of pilot farms for
forest tree variety trials. A competent staff member of INDERENA's head
office would regularly supervise project activities and make quarterly reports
to the Project tanager as well as to his superiors. All these arrangements,
as well as considerations for INCORATs assistance to INDERENA to demarcate
the reserve prior to the felling season starting in October 1974 (Annex 4),
would be stipulated in an agreement, to be approved by the Bank, between both
institutions.
Technical Assistance Programs and Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario (ICA)
7.        The technical assistance component provided for in the project would
involve mainly two programs: animal husbandry and pasture management. An
extension service would be organized to cover both, including farmer and staff
training.
8.        Construction of ICA's headquarters in Florencia, which comprise com-
prehensive laboratory facilities, was completed in 1973. Three veterinarians
are in charge of general animal health, and both coverage and quality of their
diagnostic services and vaccination campaigns are satisfactory. On the other
hand, on-farm livestock sanitation, nutrition and breeding methods in the
area are still elementary and open to considerable improvement. The 21
veterinarians in the area are inadequate, particularly as they are poorly
organized. About 11 additional field agents with training in animal husbandry
would be recruited over the four project years. These agents would be con-
cerned mainly with assisting farmers in reducing the debilitating effects of
prolonged drought on some animals (disease called "secadera"), improving
animal nutrition with mineral concentrates and inclusion of legumes (mainly
a local Phaseolus called frigolillo) in improved pastures, and promoting
seasonal breeding. With these 11 additional staff, the ratio of agents per
animal would become 1:15,000, or less than the standard of one agent for



ANNEX 10
Page 4
10,000 head recommended by Colombian authorities. However, limitations on
the capability to train qualified staff during the time available will pre-
vent larger increases at this stage.
9.        The activities of these animal husbandry agents would be closely
coordinated with those of a team to be set up to implement an intensive
pasture management program. The team would be composed of 17 field agents
and three agricultural officers: 10 field agents and two agricultural officers
would be recruited during the first three project years to assist a team of
one agricultural officer and seven credit supervisors, who are in fully settled
areas where less developmental credit is required, and who would be transferred
from credit supervision to this particular program. The team would promote
improved pasture varieties which provide a denser soil coverage and better
pasture management techniques. This program would cover applied research,
demonstration, pasture seed production and regular visits to individual
farmers.
10.       The objectives of both programs would be to assist farmers in in-
creasing their income and, by limiting overgrazing, to reduce the danger of
soil erosion. Staff would be provided with transportation (cars, motor-cycles,
horses or boats). To avoid dispersion, the teams would concentrate their
efforts on the areas where farms are easily accessible, namely, in the fully
settled foothills. The objectives would be to reach directly about 3,500
farmers eight years after project initiation. It is estimated that with
such a nucleus, the advanced techniques would spread spontaneously among
the remainder of the farm population in these areas.
11.       Training would be a key element in the success of this project.
The training program would involve Servicio Nacional de Adiestramiento (SENA)
whose main objective is to provide training for workers in Colombia. Since
1965, INCORA has maintained a contract with SENA for training approximately
15,000 workers each year in various INCORA projects throughout Colombia. SENA
had five instructors in Caqueta but their number was reduced to three in 1973
because of the absence of an integrated structure capable of providing the
necessary follow-up to help farmers put their training into practice. With
the extension service set up by the project, about 750 farmers or staff per
year could be taught by five instructors. SENA courses in livestock and
pasture management (No. 011-01 and 011-06), which would be updated and adapted
in consultation with INCORA and ICA, would be offered as well as a course in
home economics. Training for ICA, INCORA, Banco Ganadero and Caja Agraria
personnel stationed in Caqueta would include refresher courses in animal
husbandry and visits to research stations operated by ICA and Centro Inter-
national de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT). This would be organized by ICA.
Finally, the program would provide for INCORA and ICA staff to travel out-
side Colombia for training in modern cattle raising and pasture management
techniques as well as in organizing an extension service. Foreign specialists
could also be invited to Caqueta, particularly to follow up on the training
given to INCORA staff in Australia on pasture management in 1974.



ANNEX 10
Page 5
12.       ICA was founded under Decree 3116 of December 1963, which set it up
specifically and exclusively as an agricultural research and extension agency.
Farmer's technical assistance is still ICA's primary function, but various
decrees, the latest one dated December 1973, have progressively broadened its
scope of actitivities. The main recent additions to ICA's functions concern
involvement in rural development, in controlling seed production and animal
health 1/ and in advising the Minister of Agriculture on policies dealing
with prices of farm products, agricultural credit and marketing. ICA's
Board 2/ is headed by the Minister of Agriculture and consists of the General
Managers of agricultural institutions, including INCORA, and one representa-
tive of the farmers' associations. ICA has a central office in Florencia and
maintains a demonstration center at Macagual. Housing and administrative
facilties of the center are financed under an IDB loan.
13.       ICA's organizational structure was changed in 1973, mainly to cen-
tralize authority in Bogota's head office. Under the new arrangement, Caqueta
(ICA region No. 1) is attached directly to the Bogota office and has no direct
relations anymore with the main research center for livestock and pasture for
areas west of the Andes, located in Meta province. WJhile the change may be
administratively beneficial, it is technically unfavorable. The project
training program therefore would include regular visits by ICA's personnel
in Caqueta to the appropriate research stations in the country (para 11).
14.       ICA's performance in Caqueta has been handicapped by lack of fi-
nancial support and poor coordination with other services involved in agri-
cultural development, particularly INCORA. With the change in INCORA's Project
Manager in 1973, however, the coordination between INCORA and ICA has improved
considerably. Respective responsibilities under the proposed technical
assistance program, contributions of the two agencies, and joint objectives
in terms of number of demonstrations plots to be established and farmers to
be assisted would be stipulated in a joint agreement between the two agencies.
Since the program would also involve SENA for training and Pro Semilla (an
affiliate of Caja Agraria) and CECORA for seed production and distribution,
the view of these agencies would be sought in formulating it.

CAQUETA RURAL SETTLEMENT PROJECT (PHASE II)
Economic Analysis
1.        Project evaluation comprises the analysis of the investments now
being proposed (Phase II) as well as the on-going activities (Phase I) as
revised for completion during Phase II, both separately and jointly. The
costs and benefits streams are shown in Table 1.
Economic Life of the Projects
2.        Farm budgets have been prepared for a period of 20 years.  How-
ever, due to the rate of development of Phase II, the last group of farms
would begin operations in year 4 (1978); thus, the economic life of Phase II
is 23 years. For the same reason, since Phase I started in 1972, economic
life of Phase I runs for 26 years, both ending in 1998.
3.        In calculating the economic rates of return, the following assump-
tions on costs and benefits have been made:
(a) Phase II Costs
(i) Costs during the investment period (1975-1978) are those
shown in Annex 8, Tables 1 and 2, except for:
(1) price contingencies, which have been excluded;
(2) administrative costs, which have been split
between the two phases in proportion to the
number of settlers;
(3) on-farm investment loans, which have been re-
scheduled to allow for the lag in their dis-
bursement at farm level (Annex 5, Table 16); and
(4) family labor which has been costed at zero
to take into account the high rural unemploy-
ment rate in Colombia.
(ii) Costs during the development period include full cost of
administration (allocated to the two phases as explained
above), technical assistance, and road maintenance.

(b) Phase II Benefits
(i) No adjustments were necessary for prices of the commodities
produced under the project. In regard to beef, the main
project output, although prices in Colombia are somewhat
lower than current and forecasted world market prices, the
cost of transporting Caqueta production to exporting ports
would offset the price increase allowance. Other project
production (grains, pig and staple food crops) is
marketed locally and no better estimate than prevailing
prices is available. Thus, prices used in the economic
analysis are as follows:

(ii) Four categories of benefits have been quantified; these
relate to: breeding, fattening, subsistence production,
and savings in transportation costs for production in
the area excluding output of project farms (called
"indirect benefits"):
(1) benefits generated by breeding farms have been
obtained considering the types of farms (Models I,
II and III), the internal development of each farm
and the integrated development of the entire project.
The benefit of each type of farm is the "income
before loan repayment," at constant prices, shown
in Tables 5, 10 and 15 of Annex 5. No arbitrary
value has been imputed to family labor, so that
total family income, including subsistence produc-
tion, is the return on both capital and labor. Com-
bined benefits generated by breeding farms are shown
in Table 2;



ANNEX 11
Page 3
(2)  benefits generated by the fattening program are ex-
pressed as gross value of sales, the costs of the
program being those shown in Annex 5, Table 17. Al-
though part of this program is financed under Loan
739-CO, it has been entirely considered as a Phase II
component because, timewise, it occurs mainly during
this phase.
(3)  subsistence production has been assessed at Col$ 7,200
per farm, as follows:
Produce   Production       Price   Value (rounded)
(m ton)     (Col$/m ton)   (Col$)
Maize        0.4            2,400       1,000
Rice         0.4            1,800          700
Cassava       2.5           1,000       2,500
Plantain    10.0              300       3,000
7,200
(4) "indirect benefits" - savings in transportation costs -,
have been calculated on the basis of available inform-
ation for 1972 and assuming that beef production
grows at an annual of 7%. These benefits have been
considered at the time the road system is expected
to be completed. A summary of users' cost savings
is presented below and justified in Appendix 1.
Summary of Savings of Transportation Costs (1972)

Cattle           17.5          11.2            6.3

Total:         21.3          13.9            7.4
Cost savings have been allocated in equal parts to
Phases I and II.
(c) Phase I Costs. Costs during both the construction (1972-74)
and development periods are based on information collected by
a supervision mission in February 1974; therefore, they are
either actual or revised expenditures;
(d) Phase I Benefit. Benefits have been calculated by applying
Model II of Phase II, which represents the average operation.
Although the fattening program started in Phase I, it will



ANNEX 11
Page 4
be fully developed in Phase II; therefore, no benefits from
fattening are accounted for. Further, benefits were reduced
by 5% (years 1-5) and 10% (years 6-15) due to the lack of
technical assistance under Phase I.
Sensitivity Analysis
4.        Table 1 shows the chronological streams of costs and benefits for
Phase II, Phase I and the entire program. Economic rates of return have been
calculated for several cases and the results are summarized below:
