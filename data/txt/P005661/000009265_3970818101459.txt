REPUBLIC OF TUNdiSA
IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT 04PROVEMENT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUIMMARY
Borrower                     Republic of Tunisia
Amount   :                   US$22.0 million equivalent
Terms    :                   17 years, including 4 years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Project Description:         The proposed Project would support nationwide
improvements of the operation and maintenance of
about 105,000 ha of existing irrigation systems as
well as policy and institutional reforms to
increase the efficiency and self-financing of the
Irrigation Development Offices (OMVs). The
Project would (a) reduce the need for major costly
investments for the rehabilitation of existing
irrigation systems by improving maintenance
operations; (b) ensure the sustainability of
agricultural development in public irrigation
schemes; (c) improve the incomes of about 42,000
farmers and create employment opportunities; (d)
aim at eliminating OMVs' operating deficits. The
Project would consist of (a) provision of
equipment and vehicles for O&M activities and of
safety stocks of space parts, rehabilitation of
hydro- and electromechanical equipment, and
execution of rehabilitation works; (b) setting up
an efficient management information system and
defining improved planning, financial, and
operating procedures in the OMVs, upgrading the
coordination between OMVs and their supervisory
Ministries, strengthening the Water User
Associations, introducing adequate pricing
policies for OMVs' services to promote a more
rational use of resources, and financial autonomy;
(c) technical assistance and training; and (d)
on-farm development. The risk of lower than
expected rehabilitation cost savings or production
response is minimized by the project design focus
on technical assistance and training to improve
irrigation O&M and overall management of the OMVs.

IRRIGATION MAIIAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
L INTRODUCTION
1.01     Tunisia experienced an impressive economic growth during the 1970s.
Gross Domestic Production (GDP), in constant prices, increased by about 7X
p.a. and GDP per capita more than doubled to US$1.420 in 1981. Boosted by
high revenues from petroleum exports and a substantial improvement in its
terms of trade, the country managed to sustain a massive increase in
investments and a rapid growth in public and private consumption without
endangering its balance of payments situation. In 1982 and 1983, the economic
situation suffered set-backs. Adverse weather conditions depressed
agricultural and agroindustrial output and recession in Europe affected
Tunisian exports. The fall in petroleum revenues affected the balance of
payments and domestic savings.
1.02     The medium term outlook for investment and growth, to a large extent,
depends upon future development in the oil and natural gas sector. Although
current exploration programs are encouraging, it is expected that domestic
production will stabilize at present levels. Therefore, net export earnings
from hydrocarbons are likely to decline over the coming years, the country
becoming a net importer by the early 1990s. As a consequence, the main factor
of growth which allowed Tunisia over the last 10 years to simultaneously
expand public expenditures and private consumption, will disappear
progressively. Major structural changes are necessary.
1.03     Given this macro-economic environment, the Government is giving more
importance to maximizing benefits from existing assets through improved
maintenance, better management and increased capacity utilization, and to the
reform of public enterprises. The proposed Project aims at contributing to
both objectives through the reform of the ten public enterprises responsible
for managing public irrigation perimeters in Tunisia. The Project was
identified during the Bank Agricultural Sector Survey of 1982-' and prepared
under the Bank-financed Technical Assistance Project (Loan 2197-TUN). It was
appraised in September 1984 by a mission composed of Messrs. J. P. Chausse, T.
Baudon, B. Dussert and Ms. Patel (Bank staff) and Messrs. H. Boumendil, J. L.
Fousse and G. Manuellan (consultants).

EL THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Place of AMriculture in the Economy
2.01     Background.  Tunisia nas a total land area of 16.4 million ha of
which 8.4 million ha are suitable for agriculture and grazing. The country
can be divided into three main ecological zones. The northern zone (252) is
the most fertile, receiving adequate rainfall (400-1,000 mm). The central
zone (15%) receives between 200 and 400 mm of rainfall and the southern part
(60%) is a predesert zone receiving less than 200 mm of rainfall. Of the 5.0
million ha of cultivable land, 34% is planted in cereals, 35% in fruit trees
and the remainder in forage crops, vegetables, grain legumes and industrial
crops; 20% is normally left fallow. Given the high variability in rainfall,
important efforts have been made to develop irrigated agriculture (paras. 3.01
to 3.03).
2.02     Past Performance.  Tunisia's agricultural sector performed well
during the 1970s. The value of production grew at 4.4% p.a. in real terms
between 1970 and 1979, compared to 3% p.a. for middle income countries as a
group. However, the pace of growth slowed down considerably near the end of
the period and early 1980s (0.5% p.a. for 1977-82), mostly because of drought
which has repeatedly affected the country.  While the more rapid growth in
other sectors, particularly petroleum and tqurism, induced a decline in the
relative role of agriculture, it still represents 13% of Tunisia's GDP and
employs about one third of the labor force. The continued growth of
agricultural production and rural migration has resulted in an increase in
average per capita income in agriculture (from US$173 in 1960/62 to US$380 in
1979, measured in 1979 US dollars) and a reduction in the percentage of rural
population living below the absolute poverty level (from 17% in 1975 to 13% in
1980).
2.03     National Development Plans and Government Strategy.  Under the Fifth
Development Plan (1977-81), the Government's main objectives for the sector
included a balanced agricultural trade and increased rural employment and
incomes. Partly due to the drought, plan targets were in most cases not met.
Agricultural value added increased at an annual rate of 1.0X between 1976 and
1981, well below the plan target of 2.5X. Potential exports were diverted to
local consumption, and imports, in particular of cereals, increased. As a
result, the ratio of food imports to exports increased from 1.2 in 1976 to 1.8
in 1981. The basic objectives for agriculture under the Sixth Development
Plan (1982-86) have not changed. The r.eed to resolve key issues such as
employment, regional income disparities as well as increased efficiency of
investments has become even greater due to the necessity of adjusting the
economy to a post-hydrocarbon situation. The Government is aiming to achieve
this adjustment in agriculture through inter-alia: (a) a shift toward
smaller, less capital intensive investments generating employment
opportunities; and (b) the creation of a more favorable economic environment,
including the introduction of a more realistic price structure for
agricultural products. Investments in agriculture are planned to increase
from 13% of total investments during the last Plan to 19%. The Bank-financed
Technical Assistance Project (Loan 2197-TUN) is assisting the Government in
the preparation of high priority projects and subsectoral strategies,
including policy reforms.

B. Previous Bank Involvement in AFZiultural Projects
2.04     Bank Group lending for agriculture in Tunisia started in 1967, and
to date 15 projects have been approved for a total of US$358.2 million of
Bank/IDA funds, including the recently approved Northwest Agricultural
Production Project. Of these, eight are ongoing including three irrigation
projects. Performance under these projects has been mixed reflecting
institutional constraints. The First Fisheries Project (Credit 270-TUN) was
completed at the end of 1979 with considerable delays and low loan recoveries
for boats. These problems were addressed under the Second Fisheries Project
(Loan 1746-TUN) which is now progressing satisfactorily. The First and Second
Agricultural Credit Projects (Loan/Credit 779/263-TUN and Loan 1340-TUN)
financed BNT lending for onfarm development. While the projects achieved good
rates of return, the continuing problem of higher interest rates on Bank funds
than on Government-supplied credit and the lack of decentralization of BNT
caused disbursements to be slower than anticipated. The Third Agricultural
Credit Project (Loan 1885-TUN) is addressing priority credit problems. Action
has been taken to decentralize BNT's operations and raise interest rates. On
the basis of financial and agricultural sector discussions to take place
during the first half of 1985, the Government is expected to prepare a plan of
action to achieve positive interest rates and improve loan recovery ratios.
The physical implementation of the poverty-oriented Northwest Rural
Development Project (Loan 1997-TUN) is proceeding satisfactorily. The
Government is now preparing milk price reforms which should help sustain the
favorable impact of the project. The Grain Storage Project (Loan 2052-TUN) is
also progressing well after initial delays and the recruitment of new
consulting engineers. Under the Technical Assistance Project (Loan 2197-TUN),
strategies have been or are being developed for improvements in several
subsectors including farm input distribution, farm mechanization, produce
marketing, research and extension and improved operation and maintenance of
existing irrigation infrastructure. These strategies will contribute to
increasing the efficiency of investments under the Sixth and Seventh (1987-91)
Development Plans.
2.05     Implementation of the izrigation projects -  First Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project (Loan 1068-TUN), Sidi Salem Multipurpose Project (Loan
1431-TUN), Southern Irrigation Project (Loan 1796-TUN), Medjerda/Nebhana
Irrigation Project (Loan 2157-TUN) and Central Tunisia Irrigation Project
(Loan 2234-TUN) -- has been satisfactory. However, these projects have been
more concerned with rehabilitating and expanding irrigation infrastructure
than with institutional development. OED's audit of the first Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project (Loan 1068-TUN), dated November 5, 1984, determined
that the economic rate of return of the project was highly satisfactory
(32%). A major finding was that the increased reliability of water supply
brought about by rehabilitation works carried out under the project had a
major impact on farm production and incomes in the project area, by increasing
farmers' willingness to take higher risk with higher value crops. The
Irrigation Development Authorities (OMVs), the public entities which manage
the projects, have demonstrated their ability to carry out construction works
efficiently, but their management needs improvement and their performance on
operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure has been mixed.

II THE IRRIGATION SUBSECTOR
A. Bc d
3.01     The mobilization and efficient use of scarce water resources for
irrigation has been and remains a major preoccupation of the Government.
Since the early 1960s, major shares of public and private investments in
agriculture have been allocated for that purpose:  30X between 1962 and 1971,
231 from 1972 to 1976 and 44a from 1977 to 1981. Government invested heavily
in irrigation infrastructure (9 major dams, 20 smaller dams, more than 800
deep wells and about 250 pumping stations have been constructed), while the
private sector invested mostly in shallow wells (about 23,000) and related
equipment. Currently, some 205,000 ha are equipped for irrigation (1983/84)
against 120,000 ha in 1972 as follows:

/a  Irrigable area in the PPIs is expected to be about 105,000 ha
by 1985-86.
/b Total irrigation potential is estimated at about 250,000 ha
or 5i of total arable land.
3.02     The Public Perimeters (PPIs) are large irrigation schemes built by
the Government aed managed by public entities - Irrigation Development
Authorities (OMVs) - which are in charge of developing agricultural
production in their respective command areas (Chapter IV). Irrigation in
private perimeters comes from about 23,000 shallow wells equipped with pumps.
In 1984, about 160,000 ha were actually irrigated out of 205,000 ha equipped,
giving an overall average irrigation intensity-L' of 781. In the PPIs. the
average intensity is about 661 while it is 861 for the private perimeters.
The table below presents estimates of total potential water resources, by
origin, along with volumes effec ively developped in 1981 and projected to be
developed by the end of the Sixth Development Plan (1986).

/a  For a detailed discussion of water balances, see Annex 10.
A sunmary situation is presented in Table 6.
In 1981, of the about 1.9 billion m3 of water developed and available for
beneficial use 0.4 billion m3 were for domestic and industrial use and 1.5
billion m3 for agricultural purposes, but only some 60S of water developed
for irrigation was being used. The main reasons for low irrigation intensity
in PPIs are: (a) inadequate operation and maintenance of irrigation systems
due to a lack of equipment, a shortage of adequately trained staff and
inadequate allocation of resources, resulting in low network efficiencies
(about two-thirds of planned efficiencies on average); (b) the scarcity of
water for PPIs located in the southern and eastern areas; and (c) the
underutilization of available resources for PPIs in the northern part of the
country, mostly due to farmers' unwillingness to use irrigation fully because
of problems of site of land holdings and land tenure as well as preferences
for farming systems with low labor requirements (cereals).
3.03     The irrigated sector contributed significantly to the rapid growth of
Tunisian agriculture during the 1970s. In 1980, it accounted for about 251 of
the country's total agricultural GDP. About 50Z of total irrigated area was
used to produce vegetables, 351 was under fruit trees and about 81 under
fodder crops. The balance (71) was used for cereals and industrial crops
(mostly sugar beet). However, the subsector's contribution could have been
higher if more intensive use had been made of the irrigable areas.
Government's main objectives during the Sixth Development Plan are: extension
of irrigable areas; and intensification of water utilization and crop
production on existing irrigable areas. It is envisaged that D 610 million or
about 401 of total planned investments in agriculture during the Plan period
will be allocated to irrigation. These investments would increase the total
equipped area to about 245,000 ha (of which about 125,000 ha in PPIs). The
Plan also envisages efforts to improve the intensity of use of existing
facilities through: (a) renewed efforts to implement Agrarian Reform in the
PPIs; (b) more efficient extension services leading to more effective
encouragement of appropriate cropping patterns and promotion of water saving
technologies and agricultural practices; and (c) more efficient water
management through greater involvement of Water User Associations (WUAs)
improved operation and maintenance of public irrigation systems by OMVs, and
more efficient provision of commercial agricultural support services through
greater involvement of private/cooperative sector. Issues related to (a) and
(b) are discussed in the following two paragraphs, while those related to (c),
which will be directly addressed under the proposed Project, are analyzed more
fully in Chapter IV.

B. Subsectorlssues
Land Ownership and Agrarian Reform in PPIs
3-04     In Tunisia, the size of holdings is a major constraint to the
intensification of irrigation. Studies carried out by the Ministry of
Agriculture have indicated a strong inverse correlation between the size of
holdings and irrigation intensities. To rationalize the use of available
water resources and ensure fuller exploitation of its investments in
irrigation infrastructure, Government has enacted Agrarian Reform Laws1'
providing for (a) land ownership limitation; (b) land consolidation; (c)
inducement to irrigate; and (d) farmers' contributi-n to investment cost.
Details are in Table 10. While some progress has been made, particularly in
the area of consolidation in some PPIs, farmer resistance and inadequate
penalties have limited implementation of the Agrarian Reform Laws. A study on
land issues is being done under the Bank-financed Technical Assistance
Project, and an internal Government Commission has been established to review
this matter. The lack of a proper National Cadaster has affected the
Government's ability to address land issues, and it is therefore preparing a
National Cadaster and Cartography project. Farmers' contribution to
investments is discussed in more detail in the framework of cost recovery
(paras. 4.13 to 4.16).
Extension and Applied Research
3.05     Since in 1973/74, OMVs have made considerable efforts to set up
effective extension services, supported by Applied Research Stations, to cater
to the specific needs of the farmers in their sphere of influence. Although
their impact on production is difficult to assess, OMVs' extension and
research services seem to have performed reasonably well. They have been
instrumental in selecting and introducing new high vielding varieties, in
particular for vegetables, and promoting fodder crops with pure-bred milk
cows. However, the present system still has drawbacks: (a) applied research
by OMVs lacks linkages and coordination with other existing research services
and programs; and concentrates mostly on providing advice on specific crops,
without taking into consideration the whole farm system or farmers' different
needs, motivation and capabilities; (b) little attention has so far been
given to improved water management at farm level; and (c) OMVs'extension
agents are burdened by additional tasks (input supply, credit, marketing,
collection of statistics, etc.) that have diverted them from their principal
role. The Government is preparing a National Extension and Research Master
Plan under the Bank-financed Technical Assistance Project, which will propose
the measures necessary to improve Tunisia's extension and research systems,
including irrigated agriculture and is planned to be implemented in 1986 and
beyond. Under the present Project, measures would be taken (paras. 4.11-4.12
and 7.12) to divest OMVs of some of their commercially oriented activities,
which will facilitate the future reform of the extension system by allowing
OMVs' extension agents to devote more time to their primary function.

3.06     Issues dealing with the management and operations of Irrigation
Development Offices are discussed in the following chapter.
IV. IRRGATION DEVELOPMENT OFEICES (OMVs)
A. Bad
4.01     In Tunisia, the promotion of agriculture in irrigated areas (public
and private perimeters) is the responsibility of ten-I OMVs created by the
Government to (a) operate and maintain public irrigation systems; (b) provide
extension services for irrigated crops; (c) promote agricultural production by
providing a wide range of support services (including input distribution,
tractor services, marketing of produce, credit distribution) when not
available from other sources; and (d) promote the creation of farmer groups or
cooperatives to assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance (O&M)
of irrigation systems and for commercially oriented services. OMVs are
State-owned enterprises with a separate legal entity and financial autonomy
managed by a Board of Directors consisting of representatives of (a) the
Ministries of Agriculture, Planning, Finance and Economy; (b) the Destour
Party; (c) the Regional Governor; and (d) the National Farmers' Union. A
Director General appointed by the Government is in charge of OMVs' day-to-day
operations.  They are to be run as commercial enterprises,-a' except that
they also provide public services (extension) for which they are fully
compensated by the Government.  Summary statistics of Tunisia's OMVs are given
in Table 3. The paragraphs below analyze the main problems with regard to
OMVs' operations and performance, in particular in the areas of their (a)
relationships with the Government; (b) relationship with existing Water User
Associations (WUAs); (c) internal management; and (d) financial situation.
B. OMV-Government Relations
4.02     The OMVs are responsible for executing Government policies for the
development of agriculture in the PPIs. The Government provides OMVs with the
means, financial and otherwise, to achieve their assigned objectives and
monitors that OMVs' activities are carried out as efficiently as possible.  In
practice, however, this arrangement has not yet worked effectively.
4.03     Lack of Clear Obiectives.  To date, no system has been set up to
provide the OMVs with clear development objectives beyond the broad guidelines
provided by the National Development Plans; most OMVs do not have a precise
medium-term development program for their perimeters; their annual programs of
operations are discussed only in broad terms with the Ministry of Agriculture
(MOA) in the context of budgetary discussions. As a result, OMVs operate
largely on the basis of short-term considerations and their potential
contribution toward overall sector and national objectives is not fully
realized. To remedy this deficiency, the proposed Project would strengthen
the planning capabilities of the MOA, in charge of overseeing OMVs'
activities, and introduce the systematic preparation and monitoring of
medium-term development plans for each of the Offices (para. 5.12).

4.04     Inadequate HMuitoring of OMVs' Activities by Government. OmVs'
supervisory body is the Ministry of Agriculture. At present the Ministry
cannot provide for an adequate level of Government support and monitoring of
OMVs' activities because of inadequacies in current financial managemnt and
cost accounting procedures within the OMVs. While preserving or increasing
OMVs' operational autonomy, the proposed Project would strengthen OMVs'
management procedures and Government planning and monitoring of their
activities and performance to ensure that Government's objectives are achieved
and that OHVs use their resources with a satisfactory level of productivity.
4.05     Lack of Autonomy. Although OMVs are supposed to be run as autonomous
coumercial enterprises, the revenues they derive from water sales, custom
machine services and other commercial services are not sufficient to cover the
cost of these services. The bulk of the financial resources necessary to
cover their operating expenses are provided through annual operating subsidies
from the Government (para. 4.10). This has favored the perpetuation of
subsidized activities which could better be carried out by the private sector
and of overstaffing. The proposed Project would address these issues by (a)
improving the level of cost recovery for OMVs' services (para. 7.12); (b)
taking actions to eliminate some subsidized services better carried out by the
private sector (para. 5.14); and (c) introducing an effective MIS within OMVs
(including cost accounting), which would allow to determine the real cost of
their activities and of Government policies (para. 6.06).
C. ObV-Farmer Reations: Water User Associti ons (WUAs)
4.06     Water User Associations still play a relatively minor role in
managing irrigated perimeters but there is considerable scope for expanding
their operations. At present, of the four types of WUAs which exist in
Tunisia, the "Associations d'Interet Collectif" (AICs) are by far the most
important. There are currently about 130 AICs, covering some 38,000 ha of
irrigated land. Not all of them, however, are still operating. Most of the
AICs which are still active are concentrated in the southern part of the
country, in the command areas of the OMVs of Gabes (9,000 ha) and Gafsa (5,500
ha). AICs are ruled by a 1936 decree which provides that they are public
entities (collectivit6s publiques), to be managed according to public
management procedures and tightly controlled by regional administrative
bodies, the "Groupements d'Interet Hydraulique" (GIEs), created in each
Governorate by the 1975 "Code des Eaux" (CE). AICs should in principle be
responsible for (a) operating and maintaining water distribution systems; and
(b) designing and executing new hydraulic works to develop land within their
perimeters. In practice, however, most AICs have gradually ceased to play an
active role in water management. This is partly due to the higher technology
of modern irrigation systems and the resulting increased financial and
managerial skills involved.  Other constraints include: (a) their complex and
bureaucratic operating procedures (their annual budget has to be approved by
three different ministries); (b) the tight administrative control exercised by
the GIH which has increasingly stripped AICs' members from most of their
management role; and (c) the creation of OMVs which have taken over the direct
administration of irrigation systems and stripped AICs of most of their
responsibilities for water management.



-9-
4.07     The present non-involvement of farmers in the management of
irrigation schemes has two major consequences: (a) simple O&M tasks, which
could be more effectively handled by farmers themselves, are carried out by
OMVs, at a higher cost; and (b) farmers are neither aware of nor concerned
with the real cost of irrigation O&M and are t-herefore reluctant to pay the
corresponding water charges. To increase the role and responsibilities of
WUAs in the management of downstream irrigation systems, measures need to be
taken to (a) revitalize existing AICs; and (b) allow for the creation of new,
smaller, more flexible WUAs regrouping a sm-11 number of farmers to (i) take
reponsibility for the O&M of small irrigated areas; and (ii) be the
counterparts of OKVs for the management of public perimeters and resolving
disputes. The groundwork necessary to allow for the establishment of this new
type of WUAs, smaller and more flexible than AICs, is being carried out under
the Bank-financed Central Tunisia Irrigation Project (Loan 2234-TUN). That
Project envisages the creation of Irrigation Associations which would
gradually take over full responsibility for O&M operations in the small
perimeters being rehabilitated under the Central Tunisia Project. The
proposed Project would promote the increased role of WUAs in Tunisia by (a)
providing for more effective operating procedures for existing AICs; and (b)
extending to the whole of Tunisia the dispositions for the creation of small
private WUAs being tested under the Central Tunisia Irrigation Project (paras.
6.14-6.17).
D. OMYVs' anagement
4.08     OMVs' organizational structure needs only minor improvements to be
well suited to their functions and objectives, with (a) headquarters.composed
of three Divisions -Administration and Finance, Development (extension,
support services) and Irrigation (operation and maintenance, technical studies
and works)- ; and (b) Regional Directions with a structure reflecting that of
headquarters. Their management, however, is a serious obstacle to efficient
operation as analyzed in Annex 1. The main problems are: (i) a lack of
strategic and operational planning: investments for the extension or
rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure are not carried out according to a
coherent medium-term plan or set on the basis of carefully assessed
objectives, but rather determined by the availability of budgetary resources
or external financing for particular development projects; (ii) the accounting
and financial management system needs to be overhauled because the OMVs lack
an efficient cost accounting and budgeting system which would allow them to
prepare annual operating plans and budgets, analyze discrepancies between
planned and actual levels of activities and expenses, determine the real cost
of individual activities and monitor efficiency throughout the enterprise. In
addition better audit procedures are needed. Some ONVs have recently started
to improve their MIS1' but without any coordination of their efforts and
procedures; and (iii) the structure and skills of the staff need to be
improved: currently, OMVs' efficiency is impaired by general overstaffing, a
relatively low level of technical and managerial skills and the lack of an
effective staff incentive system. OMVs' lack of cost controls and
Government's policies have induced a rapid increase in OMVs' staffing which
reached about 4,500 in 1984, or one employee per 20 ha of equipped land and
1/ Under the Central Tunisia Irrigation Project (Loan 2234-TUN), the OMVs of
Kairouan and Kasserine are setting up improved accounting methods.



-10-
for about 8 farmers in the PPIs.1' Salaries account for about two-thirds of
OMVs' total operating expenses (about 55X for irrigation O&M per se). There
is an excess of administrative and support staff with adverse consequences on
OMVs' overheads: the ratio of total to administrative staff is about 11 to I
on average and as low as 6 to 1 in the best run Offices.
4.09     Irrigation O&M Operating Procedures.  Currently, the efficiency of
OMVs' operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure is negatively
affected by a number of factors, which would be addressed under the proposed
Project:
(a)  OMVs often lack the appropriate e4uipment to ensure proper
maintenance of irrigation civil works and hydro- and electro-
mechanical (HEM) equipment. They also lack the means to act rapidly
when there are breakdowns, in particular because of inadequate
communications and also because of an inadequate stocking of spare
parts. This results in frequent and costly interruptions of
operation (paras. 5.03-5.07);
(b) OMVs lack certain specialized personnel, for example
electromechanical engineers, and their O&M operational staff has a
low level of skills and is not adequately supervised (paras. 5.06 and
5.16);
(c)  OMVs have not defined clear and standardized technical operating
procedures and there is no systematic monitoring of vital statistics
on existing equipment (specifications, actual performance, repairs
etc.) (paras. 5.06 and 5.16);
(d) OMVs' annual budgets do not earmark sufficiert funds for maintenance
activities: as the Offices operate under relative financial
constraints, preventive maintenance is often neglected in favor of
more pressing activities (para. 6.08); and
Ce) Water User Associations are insufficiently developed in the public
irrigation schemes and farmers are only marginally involved in the
management of the networks (paras. 4.06, 4.07 and 5.13).
The lack of adequate maintenance results in frequent breakdowns and a poor
quality of services which, in turn, discourages water use by farmers and their
willingness to pay water charges. It also obliges OMVs to undertake costly
investments for the rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure and HEM
equipment. The Project would introduce a series of measures to improve the
operation and maintenance of public irrigation systems (para. 5.03).
1/ In Morocco, the ratio of equipped area per staff is 38 ha. Although
direct comparisons are difficult because of the differences in the scale
and methods of irrigation in the two countries, a comparison of staff
directly involved in irrigation O&M activities indicates that in 1982,
there were on average in Tunisia, for each irrigation O&M staff, 57
equipped hectares, 20 farmers and 170,000 m3 of water distributed. The
same ratios for Morocco, where the Irrigation Offices are not considered
to be understaffed, stand respectively at 450 ha, 100 farmers and 1 Mm3
of water.

E. OMVs' Fnancial Situation
4.10     OMVs' financial situation is analyzed in detail in Annex 2.  Table 4
presents the consolidated annual statements of all OMVs over the 1981-85
period. It is summarized below:

/a Excluding depreciation.
Over the 1981-84 period, OMVs' internally generated income (operating
revenues) represented on average less than 40Z of their total income. The
balance was provided by Government's annual operating subsidies. As OMVs'
operating expenses grew at a faster rate (15Z p.a.) than their operating
revenues (6Z p.aJ), annual Government subsidies increased by 24X p.a. over the
period and from 49Z of total operating expenses in 1981 to 62X in 1984.
Subsidies are currently required for most OMVs' activities. In 1982,
internally generated revenues amounted to D 4.1 million or about 45Z of OMVs'
operating expenses for activities other than public services (extension and
project management), for which they receive direct compensation from the
Government. Direct beneficiaries from OMV's services bore less than 40X of
irrigation O&M costs, about 70% of the cost of farm mechanization services and
10% of that of other services (input distribution, credit and marketing).
Government had to provide the balance. The proposed Project would introduce
measures to improve OMVs financial situation and autonomy (para. 7.20).
F. OMVs' Commercial Activities and the Role of the Private Sector
4.11     OMVs provide short-term credit in kind, distribute inputs,
provide custom tractor services and are involved in marketing activities
(Annex 1).  These activities are costly for the OMVs to provide and run at a
loss. They were originally undertaken because the private or cooperative
sectors were unable or unwilling to supply such services, and were meant to be
a temporary solution until alternative delivery mechanisms could be promoted.
The Offices have therefore played a key development role in supporting
farmers. However, they have so far been unable to promote actions which would
relieve them from what should be a temporary duty and have steadily developed
their activities in these areas. Under the Project, measures would be taken
to phase out direct involvement of OMVs in the financing of credit for onfarm



-12-
investments. Regarding farm machinery services, most farm machinery in
Tunisia is owned by private farmers (about 23,000 out of a total of 25,000
tractors). Because of Government subsidies, OMVs can maintain tariffs below
costs for their mechanization services: in 1982, revenues from these services
represented about 70% of their real cost, the balance being borne by
Government transfers. Meanwhile, due to excessive costs, OMVs tariffs are
still 10 to 15% higher than those of the private sector. OMVs machinery
services are also relatively inefficient because of poor work scheduling (the
machines travelling considerable distances between farms) and the relatively
poor maintenance of the equipment due to the lack of qualified mechanics.
Measures would be taken under the Project to improve the situation (para.
7.12).
4.12     Input distribution.  The development of the private input
distribution network has been impaired by the Government policy of fixing
input prices and distribution margins at artificially low lc-rels. The OMVs
have therefore begun distributing inputs in their conmand areas and their
activities in these areas have grown steadily in volume and complexity,
placing an increasing burden on financial and human resources which should
have been used for more effective operation and maintenance of irrigation
systems or for providing extension services. The low distribution margin
makes this activity non-profitable, causing the Offices to cut back on the
extent and quality of these services. The tendency is to order at the last
moment only the amount of inputs which is certain to be sold, which creates
transport bottlenecks and frequent depletion of stocks at distribution
centers. Under the Project, measures would be taken to achieve: (a) full
cost recoveries for OMVs' services from their beneficiaries; and (b) promote a
gradual divestiture by OMVs of their commercial activities (para. 7.12).
G. lration Cost Recov
4.13     Institutional Framework.  Government policy for the recovery of
investments in public irrigation perimeters is embodied in the Land Reform
Legislation (para. 3.05). Benefitting farmers are charged a betterment levy
fixed by decree at the time a perimeter is officially established. The levy
is based on investment cost per ha, soil productivity, proposed cropping
pattern and projected income and other socio-economic factors. Betterment
levies aim at recovering from benefitting farmers part of the increase in land
value due to irrigation. Recovery levels have been fixed at 25-70% of
estimated land value-added in the Lower Medjerda Valley (LMV) and much less
(about 20%) for other PPIs. The procedures for recovering farmers'
contribut.ons include payment in kind (transfer of land to the State) for
farmers owning more than the ceiling imposed on holdings by the Agrarian
Reform Legislation, and cash payments (over a 10-period, at 5% interest with a
2-year grace period).  A'though there is no explicit framework for the
recovery of irrigation operation and maintenance costs, Government's stated
policy is for volumetric water charges paid by farmers to cover at least 100%
of irrigation O&M costs.
4.14     Implementation of Cost Recovery Arrangements.  It is estimated that
the recovery of land betterment levies specified under the Agrarian Reform
laws would permit the recovery of only a very small proportion of initial



-13-
investment costs (1% to 8Z)."' Actual recovery of farmers' contribution to
investment costs has, to date, been limited (Table 10 para. 4) except in cases
of land sales where the sale cannot be completed until the Government has been
reimbursed any amount due. Since 1981/82, Government has shown a willingness
to move toward greater recovery of O&M costs. The table below presents the
evolution of water charges over the 1980/81-84/85 period and the current level
of cost recovery.

/g Investment and OH costs; see Annex 13 Table 1 for estimation of investment costs per M3.
Water charges have been substantially increased since 1980/81. Average annual
increases over the period have ranged from 15X to as high as 36% in current
terms and from 3 to 24% in constant terms. However, current water charges
still cover on average only about 40% of irrigation O&M costs.z- The lowest
cost recoveries are registered for OMVs in the central part of the country
(ODTC, Sidi Bouzid) and for Nebhana which have high O&M costs per m3 (mainly
because of high pumping costs and low quantities of water actually delivered
to farmers), and the highest for the OMV of Gafsa-Jerid which has the lowest
06M costs per m'.  Irrigation O&M costs are mainly dependent on three
factors: (a) the volume of water distributed by the irrigation systems; (b)
the pumping costs; and (c) the operating efficiency of OMVs themselves. In
several PPIs located in the northern part of the country (OMVVM, Jendouba,
3
Lakhmes), high O&M costs per m  are largely due to the underuse of available
water resources. Because of the low volume distributed, irrigation schemes
operate at low capacity and O&M costs per cubic meter tend to be much higher
than they should be. The unit O&M costs could greatly decrease if fuller use
of water and system's capacity could be achieved. In other perimeters (ODTC,
Sidi Bouzid, Kairouan), the need to pump water at substantial depths has a
considerable effect on total 06M costs.3'  In other OMVs (Nebhana) high O&M

zosts are primarily due to high overhead linked to the scarcity of available
water resources. Finally, O&M costs are affected by OMVs' operating
efficiency. Current costs do not truly correspond to "efficient" O&M costs
insofar as they are inflated by over-staffing and increased overhead costs due
to the multiplication of OMVs (para. 4.05).
4.15     Because of the lack of detailed and accurate statistics, it is
difficult to assess current level of recovery of total (investment and O&M)
irrigation costs. As a proxy, current replacement costs per irrigated hectare
have been estimated for the various technologies used in Tunisia's PPIs.
Based on standard water consumption per hectare, it is estimated (Annex 13,
Table 8) that investment costs vary from D 0.015/m3 in large gravity
perimeters (OMVVM) to as high as U 0.030/m3 in perimeters fed by pumping
stations and using sprinkler irrigation (Jendouba, Nebhana). On that basis,
it can be estimated that current water charges provide for the recovery of 14Z
to 37% of total irrigation costs.
4.16     Irrigation projects financed by the Bank in Tunisia (para. 2.05) have
adopted a consistent approach to cost recovery based on (a) the recovery of
investment costs according to Agrarian Reform Laws; (b) the recovery of 100%
of O&M costs; and (c) recovery levels consistent with farmers' ability to
pay. The two most recent Bank-financed irrigation projects provide, in
particular, for full recovery of the water distribution network O&M cost (an
estimated 72% of total O&M costs) before December 31, 1987 in the PPI of the
Nebhana (Loan 2157-TUN) and for full O&M cost recovery by December 31, 1989 in
those PPIs of the Kairouan and ODTC OMVs included in the Central Tunisia
Project (Loan 2234-TUN). The proposed Project would introduce comprehensive
reforms, consistent with the measures already taken, to increase the financial
autonomy of the Offices and encourage a more rational use of water available.
V. TIHE PROJECT
A. Project Concept and Objectives
Project Rationale
5.01     By aiming at nationwide improvements of the operation and maintenance
of irrigation systems and at reforms to increase the efficiency of the
institutions concerned and reduce the burden of their operating subsidies, the
Project would make an important contribution to the achievement of the
objectives of the country's Sixth Development Plan and be fully consistent
with Bank strategy for assisting Tunisia's agricultural sector. It would be
based on reforms recently introduced and tested under Bank-financed projects.
It incorporates actions and measures which, when introduced nationally, would
ensure a more efficient use of the existing infrastructure and bring about
important improvements in the management and efficiency of the institutions
operating in the sector. Other constraints to onfarm development such as
applied research, extension services, or agricultural support services (input
distribution, marketing of produce or agricultural credit) are being addressed
through separate ongoing projects financed by the Bank or through other
projects under preparation under the Technical Assistance Project (Loan
2197-TUN).



-15-
Proiect Obiectives
5.02     The main objectives of the Project would be to:  (a) increase and
ensure the sustainability of agricultiral production within some 105,000 ha of
irrigation land in the PPIs, thereby contributing to Government's objective of
self-sufficiency in food production; (b) improve the incomes of farmers living
in PPIs and create employment opportunities directly and through forward and
backward linkages; (c) aim at-eliminating OMVs' operating deficit, thereby
reducing the burden of annual operating subsidies on Government's budget; and
(d) reduce the need to regularly undertake major investments for the
rehabilitation of existing irrigation systems by improving regular maintenance
operations. These objectives would be achieved through:
(a) improving OMVs' capabilities to provide increased water delivery, in
a timely and cost-effective manner, and to maintain existing
irrigation systems;
(b) introducing pricing and cost recovery policies for OMVs' services, in
particular irrigation water, aimed at (i) a more rational use of
available resources; (ii) increased competition from the private and
cooperative sectors; and (iii) greater financial autonomy of OMVs;
(c) setting up an institutional framework providing for (i) improved
management efficiency and greater accountability for OMVs; and (ii)
strengthened planning and control capabilities for Government
services in charge of monitoring OMVs' operations; and
(d) increasing the role and responsibilities of- Water User Associations
in the O&M irrigation systems.
B. Suunmary Description of Project Components
5.03     To achieve its overall objectives, the Project would implement, over
a five-year period, the following actions:
Ca) An Investment Component aimed at strengthening OMVs' O&M capabilities
including:
- the purchase of heavy equipment and vehicles for O&M activities;
-  the rehabilitation of the hydro and electromechanical (HEM)
equipment;
- the establishment of safety stocks of spare parts for HEM
equipment and irrigation networks;
- the rehabilitation of part of OMVVM's (i) irrigation network
(serving an area of about 1,000 ha); and (ii) drainage network
(1,100 km of ditches and 960 km of drains); and
- support for the improvement and maintenance of OMVVM's feeder road
system (600 km).
(b) An Institutional/Policy Reform Component aimed at:1'
- strengthening the coordination between OMVs and their supervisory
Ministries (Agriculture, Plan, Finance) for the planning and
monitoring of their activities;
1/ Details in Table 8.



-16-
- strengthening the role of Water User Associations (WUAs) in the
O&M of irrigation systems;
- improving the management of OMVs through the setting-up of an
efficient Management Information System (MIS) and the definition
of improved financial and operating procedures; and
- introducing pricing policies for OMVs' services, in particular for
irrigation water, promoting a more rational use of. existing
resources and a greater financial autonomy of OMVs.
(c) A Technical Assistance, Training and Support Action Component
including:
- technical assistance to OMVs to define improved accounting,
financial and operating procedures, set up a new MIS and carry out
the necessary related training programs;
- technical assistance to OMVs to prepare detailed terms of
reference or engineering design for proposed project works, and to
carry out proposed water management studies;
- technical assistance to the Directorate of Planning and Statistics
(DPSAE) to strengthen capabilities to plan and monitor OMVs'
activities;
- the establishment of a system to monitor water flows in OMVVM's
irrigation network;
- the creation of a pilot sector of about 500 ha where OMVVM would
test alternative water delivery and management technologies;
- the equipment necessary for the OMV of Gafsa-Jerid to carry out
experiments on water saving technologies and cropping methods; and
Cd) On-farm development.
C. Detailed Features
Investment Component
5.04     O&M Equipment.  The efficiency of OMV's O&M activities is hampered by
a lack of specialized heavy equipment (draglines, cranes, excavators,
graders), vehicles and basic tools (fixed and mobile workshops) (para. 4.09).
The Project would finance the upgrading of these facilities to the minimum
necessary for ensuring adequate operation and maintenance of irrigation
systems, and rehabilitation works in OMVVM (para. 5.08).   A detailed
description of proposed equipment is given in Table 9.
5.05     Safety Stocks.  Because of the current lack of proper maintenance,
public irrigated systems experience frequent breakdowns. As OMVs do not
currently maintain safety stocks of pipes and flumes or electromechanical
spare parts, and are therefore unable to effect the necessary repairs rapidly,
these repeated and sometimes prolonged interruptions in water deliveries can
have very negative effects on agricultural production when occurring during
peak irrigation periods. They also discourage farmers to intensify irrigation
and make them less willing to pay water charges. Under the Project, each OMV
would constitute a safety stock of irrigation spare parts sufficient to cover
about one year of maintenance requirements, and acquire back-up equipment
(mobile transformers, generators, pumps) which would permit to continue water
deliveries while effecting the necessary repairs. A detailed list of spare
parts and materials to be purchased under the Project is given in Annex 8.



-17-
5.06     Rehabilitation and Maintenance Contract.  There are currently about
33 large and 210 smaller pumping stations in Tunisia. A large proportion of
existing electromechanical equipment is relatively old and, because of a lack
of proper maintenance, experiencing efficiency losses and frequent
breakdowns. One of the main reasons for the lack of adequate maintenance is
the difficulty for OMVs to recruit the necessary specialized personnel, which
is in very short supply in Tunisia and comnands high salaries in the private
sector. Under the Project, OMVs or groups of OMVs would enter into a
multiannual contract (3 years) with one (or several) enterprise(s) to (a)
rehabilitate OMVs' main pumping stations so that they operate with
satisfactory efficiency and under adequate security mechanisms; (b) ensure
regular preventive maintenance and carry out necessary repairs; and (c) train
OMVs' staff. The dispositions under the contracts would vary according to the
specific needs of each OMV: for the large pumping stations of the OMVs
located in Northern Tunisia, all rehabilitation, maintenance and repair works
would be done under contract; OMVs' located in Central and Southern Tunisia
may elect to perform some simple maintenance and/or repair work with their own
staff and equipment. These contracts would be awarded on the basis of ICB in
accordance with Bank guidelines. All contractual arrangements would include a
large training component. At the end of the first contract, OMVs would elect
either to renew it or to take over all maintenance work if its staff has been
sufficiently trained to do so effectively. Detailed Terms of Reference of the
prc1posed Rehabilitation & Maintenance Contract are presented in Annex 7 of the
Implementation Volume.
5.07     Other Equipment.  The geographical dispersion of individual
perimeters within the conmand area of a particular OMV, the frequent absence
of automatic regulation and the lack of telephone coumunications between the
different points of irrigation systems result in water management
inefficiencies, water losses and long delays in effecting the necessary
repairs. Under the Project, each OMV would establish a radio network between
the important components of its irrigation systems (pumping stations,
reservoirs, fixed and mobile workshops). Also OMVs would acquire the
Electronic Data Processing (EDP) Equipment necessary for their new MIS: each
OMV would be equipped with a minicomputer at headquarters and microcomputer in
each of its regional Offices.
5.08     Rehabilitation of Irrigation Infrastructure.  The Project would
include priority investments for the rehabilitation works in OMVVM
perimeters. Certain areas of the irrigation system have not been
rehabilitated since their construction (1960s) and are now non-operational.
Works proposed under the Project would consist of replacing about 30,000 ml of
tertiary and quaternary canals and some 250 outlet structures. This would
make possible the resumption of irrigation on about 1,000 ha of previously
irrigated land and the improvement of the efficiency of conveyance structures
in other areas of the perimeter (about 3,000 ha). The Project would also
finance the rehabilitation of OMVVM's drainage system. The system consists of
about 1,100 km of ditches and 960 km of drains protecting the 3,000 ha most
sensitive to water logging. This relatively dense network has not been
properly maintained and is not operating satisfactorily. Finally, OMVVM would
get project funds to carry out a program of delayed maintenance over about 600
km of feeder roads. Due to the clayey nature of most of the Lower Medjerda
Valley soils, access to irrigation infrastructure and transportation of
agricultural inputs and produce is 'F, icult and sometimes impossible during



-18-
the rainy season. Under the proposed program, the degraded stone base layer
of about 300 km of feeder road would be renewed and about 300 km of dirt road
would be resurfaced.
5.09     OMVVM's Water Flow Monitoring System.  Although flow monitoring is
essential to ensure efficient water management, there is currently no system
for the covering of the main conveyance structures. Under the Project, a
simple system would be set up to monitor (a) capacity utilization at various
points cf the system; (b) the efficiency of the conveyance structures; and (c)
water losqes and water actually delivered to farmers. The preliminary design
of the system has been prepared by OMVVM. OMVVM would prepare, with the
cooperation of DEGTH and the proposed technical assistance, the combined
tender documents for undertaking both the detailed design and the actual
establishment of the monitoring system.
5.10     OMVVM's Pilot Irrigation Perimeter.  Following the study of
irrigation technologies to be undertaken under the Project (para. 5.03 (c)),
alternative water distribution systems (downstream control systems, open,
underground and mixed distriLution systems, low pressure, californian,
aspersion systems) would be tested to determine the technology best suited to
water characteristics and socio-economic factors. This pilot experiment,
undertaken on about 500 ha, would provide the basis for future extension or
rehabilitation of OMVVM's perimeters. Terms of reference for the proposed
study and preliminary designs of the pilot experiment are presented in Annexes
8 and 9.
5.11     Gafsa Water Saving Experiments.  The OMV of Gafsa-Jerid would
undertake experiments on water saving technologies at its Gafsa Applied
Research Station and, in situ, on private farms. The Project would finance
the onfarm irrigation equipment necessary to conduct the proposed
experiments. The experiments themselves would be designed and monitored in
collaboration with the "Centre de Recherche et d'Experimentation du G6nie
Rural" (CREGR) and the National Research Institute (INRAT). A preliminary
research program has been prepared by the OMV.
Institutional/Policy Reform Component
5.12     OMV-Government Interface.  Under the Project each Office would
prepare a development plan covering the period of the country's Seventh
Development Plan (1987-91) and defining medium-term objectives and operating
targets negotiated with Government. In addition, program-contracts (contrats
de programme) would be introduced, on a pilot basis, between the Government
and three OMVs, selected for their representativity based on these OMVs'
medium-term development plans, clearly defining Government and OMVs'
respective obligations. OMVs' objectives and targets would be set out in such
a way that they are monitorable and include, inter alia, increases in activity
levels (volume of water delivered), reduction in operating costs and adequacy
of maintenance operations. The Project would strengthen the capacity of the
Ministry of Agriculture (DPSAE and DCOMVPI) to plan and supervise OMVs'
activities and reinforce the coordination between the various Government
agencies involved (Ministry of Agriculture, Planning and Finance) - (para.
6.09).



-19-
5.13     OMV-Farmer Relations. Measures would be taken to increase farmers'
role and responsibilities in the management of irrigation systems through (a)
the streamlining and simplification of the organization and operating
procedures of AICs; (b) the definition and adoption of the legal framework
necessary to create simpler, private WUAs to operate and _-Lintain small
irrigation schemes; (c) the definition of a legal framework for allowing
contractual relationships between WUAs and OMVs; and (d) the adoption of
adequate incentives for farmers to create such W[JAs (para. 6.14).
5.14     Promotion of Cooperative and Private Sectors. OMVs would be required
to provide their co,miercially oriented agricultural services (input
distribution, marketing, farm mechanization) at real cost. It would provide
for fair competition, encourage the private sector to invest for supplying the
required services and thereby promote the development of alternative, more
efficient, scurces for these services and lead to a gradual divestiture of
OMVs in these areas.
5.15     Improvement of OMVs' Management. A number of organizational and
institutional measures would be introduced to improve the effectiveness of
OMVs' management: (a) the definition and setting-up of an efficient MIS,
including cost accounting, budgeting, financial planning and control,
inventory management and internal audit; (b) the definition, for each OMV, of
a medium-term staffing development plan aimed at improving overall staff
productivity;-and (c) systematic external audit of OMVs' annual accounts. In
addition, improvements would be introduced in their technical operating
procedures, in particular for irrigation O&M activities. Funds would be
specifically earmarked in the Offices' annual operating budgets to ensure a
satisfactory level of maintenance (para. 6.08).
Technical Assistance, Training and Studies Component
5.16     Technical assistance (para. 6.18) would be provided to OMVs, during
the first three years of the Project, for (a) the reform of their accounting
and financial system (including data processing); (b) the improvement of their
planning capabilities and the preparation of their medium-term development
plans; (c) the improvement of their technical operating procedures, including
the preparation of an O&M manual; (d) the setting-up of a system to monitor
agricultural and productivity development at farm level to assess the
evolution of farm incomes and farmers' ability to pay; and (e) the training of
their staff in accounting and financial management, strategic and operational
planning, irrigation O&MI procedures and irrigation economics. Technical
assistance would also be provided to strengthen the DPSAE and the DCPPI of the
Ministry of Agriculture respectively in (a) strategic planning, budgeting and
monitoring of OMVs activities; and (b) technical and managerial aspects of
OMVs' operations. Detailed terms of reference and implementation schedule for
the proposed technical assistance to OMVs and DPSAE are presented in Annex 11,
and training priorities in Annex 3 of the Implementation Volume.
5.17     In addition, the Project would finance the expertise necessary to
carry out the proposed technical studies on water management. OMVVM would do
specific studies to (a) design the proposed irrigation pilot sector to test
alternative water distribution technologies; (b) design the proposed water
flow monitoring system; and (c) monitor the sediment load of irrigation water
downstream of the main dams. The OMV of Jendouba would study the adequacy of



-20-
existing safety and automatic regulation of its irrigati:n system. The OMV of
Nabeul would assess the maximu hydraulic capacity and the operating
efficiency of its main distribution and regulation systems, in view of the
recent availability of water coming from the Medjerda system through the new
Medjerda-Cap Bon canal. Finally, the OMV of Lakhmes would study (a) the flood
protection system for its perimeter; and (b) the adequacy of the existing
safety and automatic regulation mechanisms of its irrigation system. The TORs
for these studies are presented in Annex 9 of the Implementation Volume. The
necessary expertise would be recruited on the basis of detailed TORs prepared
by the respective OMVs in collaboration with the Department of Hydraulic Works
(DEGTH) and Rural Engineering (DGR) of the MOA, which would also supervise the
implementation of the studies.
D. Projiet Costs
5.18     Total Project costs include (a) the cost of proposed investments.
technical assistance, training and studies; (b) OMVs' and Government's
incremental operating costs linked to the Project; and Cc) incremental onfarm
development costs due to increased agricultural activity induced by the
Project. Total Project costs are estimated at US$61.0 million (D 48.3
million) of which US$27.5 million (D 22.0 million) or 45S would be in foreign
exchange. Total costs include an estimated US$13.7 million (D 11.1 million)
or 22X in taxes and duties. Base costs are estimated in February 1985
prices. Physical contingencies have been included at 10% for technical
assistance and OMVs' equipment and vehicles, 15Z for civil works and 202 for
studies, maintenance contracts and pilot irrigation schemes (OMVVM and
Gafsa). Total physical contingencies amount to US$5.7 million or 132 of
Project base costs. Price contingencies have been calculated oa the basis of
projected price increases,-' applied to local and foreign costs including
contingencies. They amount to US$10.0 million or 16.5Z of total Project
costs. Total contingencies amount to US$15.7 million or 26% of total Project
costs. Cost estimates are presented in detail in Annex 17 and are summarized
in the following table:

E. Finanemn
5.19     A Bank loan of US$22.0 million is proposed to finance lOOZ of the
Project's foreign exchange cost, excluding onfarm development costs which
would be financed from other sources available through the credit system. The
Bank loan would thus cover 36X of total Project costs (47% of the total costs
net of taxes) and 80% of total foreign exchange costs of the Project.
Retroactive financing, not to exceed US$500,000 for disbursements against
eligible expenditures incurred before the signing of the Loan Agreement but
after February 1st, 1985, is proposed to cover the costs of the technical
assistance and computer equipment necessary to set up the proposed OMVs'
accounting system and MIS (paras. 6.06 and 6.07). The following table
summarizes the proposed financing plan for Project costs:

The Government would earmark about US$21.0 million of the loan proceeds (96%)
to OMVs, through their respective annual budgets, to finance proposed Project
activities. The balance would be used by MOA to finance the foreign exchange
costs of part of the Project's technical assistance, and the training and
studies component. Other donors would finance the remainder of the technical
assistance component (US$2.4 million). The Government has already started
making contacts in this regard and prospects are favorable. It was agreed at
negotiations that cofinancing arrangements would be finalized by January 1,
1986. If cofinancing does not materialize, the Government has indicated it
would provide the financing from its own resources. Incremental onfarm
operating costs would be financed by beneficiaries (US$4.6 million) and credit
institutions (US$4.6 million), under standard terms and conditions for
seasonal credit (interest rates range from 6.75 - 8.5%). The Government would
finance the balance of total net Project costs (US$13.7 million). The Bank
loan would be for 17 years including a 4-year grace period.

F. Procurement
5.20         Procurement would be carried out by the MOA for the proposed
technical assistance component for which detailed terms of reference and
implementation schedule have been prepared and are presented in Annex 11 of
the  Implementation Volume.    The necessary  technical assistance  for  the
proposed water management studies would be recruited on the basis of TORs
prepared by the concerned OMV; in collaboration with DEGTH and DGR, which
would also supervise the implementation of the studies. OMVVM would be
responsible for the grouped procurement of Project O&M equipment and safety
stocks for all OMVs on the basis of technical specifications prepared by
individual OMVs and approved by the central services of MOA (Directorate of
Rural Works). The design of OMVs electronic Data Processing (EDP) System
would be done by the consultants in charge of designing their new MIS.
Tendering would be done by DCOMVPI on the basis of specifications approved by
Tunisia "Centre National Informatique" (CNI), a public concern empowered to
approve the EDPs for administrative bodies and parastatals. Tendering for
maintenance contracts for OMVs' hydro/ electromechanical equipment would be
done on the basis of detailed technical specifications prepared with the
support of the proposed technical assistance. Terms of reference of the
proposed maintenance contract are presented in Annex 7. The table below lists
contracts to be awarded and the methods of procurement.

5.21     International Competitive Bidding.   The purchase of
electromechanical equipment for OMVs safety stocks (US$3.7 million), heavy
equipment (US$3.0 million), OMVVM specialized irrigation equipment (US$4.4
million), vehicles (US$4.7 million), radio equipment (US$0.5 million),
computer equipment (US$1.5 million) and supply of pipes and flumes (US$1.9
million) would be procured by ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Qualifying domestic manufacturers would be granted a margin of preference
equal to 15Z of the c.i.f. bid price of the imported goods or the actual
custom duties and import taxes whichever is lower. When bulking is not
feasible, contracts for equipment and vehicle contracts not exceeding
US$150,000 equivalent, and totalling no more than US$0.3 million equivalent
for each Office and US$3.0 million equivalent in aggregate, may be awarded on
the basis of local competitive bidding procedures which are acceptable to the
Bank. Contract(s) for the rehabilitation and maintenance of OMVs'
electromechanical equipment (US$10.4 million) would be awarded through ICB.
5.22     Local Competitive Bidding.  Local competitive bidding procedures are
generally consistent with the need for economy and efficiency in the execution
of the Project. Laws and regulations regarding local procurement procedures
and practices in Tunisia are being reviewed in the Bank in order to reach a
judgment as to whether local procedures are acceptable for Bank-financed
contracts. The findings of that review will be discussed with the Tunisian
authorities and agreements would be sought regarding any changes needed to
make the procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for the building of
OMVs' workshops (US$0.7 million), and civil works for the establishmLent of
OMVVM's pilot sector (US$1.5 million), would be awarded on the basis of LCB,
as the small size and scattered nature of these works would not be of interest
to foreign contractors.
5.23     Other Procedures.  Civil works for the rehabilitation of OMVVM's
irrigation, drainage and feeder road systems (US$2.6 million) would be carried
out on force account by OMVVM with its own equipment (part of which would be
procured under the Project through ICB) and personnel. The quantities of work
involved are difficult to define in advance and the works are scattered
throughout the perimeters and must be carried out without disrupting
irrigation operations. Equipment for Gafsa's water saving experiments (US$0.2
million) would be procured through local shopping. Office equiment and
furniture for the Project unit in the MOA (US$0.1 million), easily obtained
off-the shelves, would also be procured through local shopping.
5.24     Consultants Services.  Contracts for training, studies, and the part
of technical assistance financed by the Bank (US$1.3 million) would be
awarded in accordance with Bank guidelines.
5.25     Contract Review.  All bidding packages for works estimated to cost
the equivalent of US$500,000 or more and bidding packages for goods estimated
to cost the equivalent of US$150,000 or more would require Bank's prior
approval, as would the final award of the related contracts. Prior Bank
approval would also apply to the bidding documents and contracts for the
procurement of computer and radio equipment and of Bank financed technical
assistance regardless of their amount. These arrangements would represent
prior review by the Bank of about 85S of total estimated value of contracts.
The other contracts would be subject to random post-review by the Bank after
contract award.



-25-
5.26     Assurances that the above procedures would be followed were obtained
at negotiations. In addition, agreement has been reached on the following
implementation schedule:
(a) detailed tender documents for the rehabilitation and maintenance
contract would be submitted for approval to the Bank before June 30,
1986, and the contract would be signed before December 31, 1986;
(b) full engineering design of the proposed irrigation rehabilitation
works in OMVVM's PPIs would be submitted to the Bank for approval no
later than March 31, 1986, and the necessary equipment would be
purchased only after satisfactory review by the Bank of the de_ailed
designs;
(c) OMVVM would submit the detailed designs of and tender documents for
its proposed water flow monitoring system and pilot irrigation sector
to the Bank for approval before June 30, 1986;
(d) the contractual agreement between OMV Gafsa-Jerid. CRGR and INRAT to
undertake and monitor the OMV's experiments in water saving
technologies and the latter's detailed design would be submitted to
the Bank for approval before December 31, 1985; and
'e) the detailed TORs and tender documents for the proposed water
management studies would be submitted to the Bank for approval before
June 30, 1986.
G. Diens
5.27     The proposed Bank loan has been estimated to be disbursed over a
period of seven fiscal years. This is somewhat shorter than the historical
disbursement profiles for Bankwide and EMENA agricultural projects and all
sector Tunisian projects which indicate that full disbursement generally
requires an average of eight years. Faster disbursements for the proposed
loan are due to (a) the fact that the Project's major investments, which
mostly involve the procurement of goods and services, would take place in the
first three years of Project implementation; and (b) the setting-up of the
proposed Project revolving fund (para. 5.29). Disbursements would be made
after receipt of full documentation, except in the case of works done under
force account and goods and services provided under contracts of a value of
less than US$50,000 equivalent for which disbursements would be made against
statements of expenditures (SOE) certified by the implementing agency
involved. The latter would retain the supporting documentation and make it
available for inspection during Bank supervision missions and by external
auditors. Except in case of direct payments, no reimbursement application for
less than US$20,000 would be accepted. An estimated schedule of disbursements
is summarized below and detailed in Table 2:

Total                        22.00
5.29     To improve the efficient and timely implementation of the Project,
the Bank would deposit after loan effectiveness an initial sum of US$500,000
to set up a revolving fund to finance eligible expenditures corresponding to
the Bank's share of the average three months' Project needs. The Bank funds
would be deposited in US dollars in a special account at the Central Bank of
Tunisia (BCT) and would be channeled as needed to the Project through the
Banque Nationale de Tunisie (BNT). For this purpose, a Project account ruld
be opened by the DCOMVPI of the MOA at BNT in Tunis, and OMVs would have a
similar project subaccount at the local BNT branches. Government counterpart
funds would be timely secured through appropriate budget allocations.
Assurances were obtained that the annual operating and development plans and
proposed budget and financial plans for the project and the OMVs approved by



-27-
the Coordinating and monitoring Committee (para. 6.04) would be presented to
the Bank for review no later than November 30, 1985 and September 30 of each
year thereafter.
5.30     The Bank would replenish the revolving fund as requested upon receipt
of satisfactory evidence that expenditures made from it were eligible for
financing out of the fund. A replenishment request would normally be sent to
the Bank when 50% of the revolving fund has been disbursed, i.e., about every
two to three months. Should any disbursement made from the special account
not be acceptable to the Bank, Government would be required to deposit the
corresponding ineligible amount into the special account, or if the Bank so
requests, refund-to the Bank an amount equal to the amount not eligible.
5.31     No further deposits into the special account would be made by the
Bank when the total unwithdrawn amount of the part of the loan that is
expected to be disbursed at loan closure would be equal to US$1.0 million. If
it is determined that any amount outstanding in the special account is not
required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Government
would refund to the Bank such amount outstanding in the special account.
Assurances on the above points were obtained at negotiations.
VI. ORGANiZATION AND IPLE3MENTATION
A. Project Management
6.01     The proposed Project would be implemented through existing
institutions. No new institutional structure would be created, the objective
being to strengthen existing agencies and the coordination between them to
ensure efficient Project execution. The Ministry of Agriculture, which is the
technical supervisory body of the OMVs, would have the overall responsibility
for Project implementation and monitoring. The Ministries of Planning and
Finance would participate in the definition, approval and monitoring of OMVs
medium-term development plans and annual budgets (para. 6.04). OMVs would
have the direct responsibility for actual execution of Project's activities.
6.02     Ministry of Agriculture.  Within the MOA, the DCOMVPI would
coordinate and monitor Project activities, carry out the recruitment of
consultants for the proposed technical assistance, training and studies and
provide OMVs with the necessary assistance in managerial and technical
matters. At present, DCOMVPI has a Director but no staff. It would therefore
be strengthened through the recruitment of the following Tunisian staff: (a)
a Deputy Director, with financial/managerial expertise, who would be the
Project Manager in charge of coordinating and supervising day-to-day Project
implementation; (b) two administrative staff in charge, in particular, of
monitoring the financial and administrative aspects of project execution
(contracts, disbursements); (c) two Tunisian technical specialists in each of
the areas of hydro and electromechanical equipment, irrigation systems and
water management, and irrigation economics; and (d) support staff as
necessary. To carry out its activities, DCOMVPI would benefit from a
technical assistance (TA) program over a period of about three years (para.
5.16). The Project would also finance the vehicles and equipment necessary
for DCOMVPI to carry out proposed activities. The recruitment of the Project
Manager would be a condition of effectiveness. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the necessary TA and DCOMVPI administrative and technical
staff would be recruited no later than January 1, 1986.

6.03     The DPSAE of the MOA would be in charge of (a) negotiating with OMVs
their meuium-term development plans; (b) reviewing and endorsing their annual
operating plans and budgets; and (c) monitoring OMVs' performance. As the
necessary technical skills do not presently exist in MOA. DPSAE would need to
secure the assistance of a specialist in corporate planning, budgeting and
budget control for a period of about two years (para. 5.16). Two Tunisian
counterparts would be recruited and trained during Project implementation to
be fully operational at the end of the technical assistance period. The
Project would finance the equipment (a micro computer and office furniture)
necessary for DPSAE to carry out proposed activities. Assistances were
obtained at negotiations that the proposed management control specialist and
the appointment of its two Tunisian counterparts would be recruited by January
1, 1986.
6.04     A Coordinating and Monitoring Committee would be created to be
responsible for (a) reviewing OMVs' medium-term development plans and annual
operating plans and budgets; (b) monitoring OMVs' performance; and (c)
recommending policy reforms or measures to improve OMVs' management,
performance and financial situation. This Committee, which would meet at
least once every six months, would be chaired by the Secretary General of the
MOA and include representatives of the MOP and MOF, and of the concerned
Directorates of the MOA (DPSAE, DCPPI, DAF, DGR, DEGTH). DPSAE would assure
PCC's secretariate. The establishment of the Committee would be a condition
of effectiveness of the loan.
6.05     Project activities would be carried out by the OMVs in their
respective command areas. OMVVM's Studies and Civil Works Department, which
has the necessary technical capacity and experience, has prepared preliminary
engineering design for the proposed rehabilitation works. OMVVM would be
responsible for the preparation of the detailed engineering designs end for
the execution of the works on force account for the rehabilitation works in
its command area. With the technical assistance provided under the Project,
the OMVs would (a) carry out Project's investments; (b) prepare and execute
their medium-term development plans; and (c) introduce the proposed reforms in
their accounting and financial management systems. Implementation
arrangements for these activities are discussed below.
B. RebabiJitatin of OMVs' Aceomting and Financial System
6.06     OMVs' Accounting System.  Under the Project, a comprehensive set of
measures would be taken to improve OMVs' MIS (Annex 4). The program would be
coordinated by DCOMVPI, in collaboration with the other Government services
concerned (DPSAE of MOA, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Planning).
(a)  In a first phase, standard accounting principles and procedures for
recording OMVs' operations would be defined in liaison with the
National Accountancy Board. In particular, methods for the valuation
of OMVs' assets and liabilities and principles of ownership over
their various assets (irrigation infrastructure, buildings and
equipment, inputs) would be clearly established. Opening financial
statements would then be prepared for each OMV on the basis of the
new accounting principles and methods and of an exhaustive inventory
of their assets and liabilities. About 27 man-months of technical
assistance would be financed under the Project to this effect (para.
6.18).



-29-
(b) During a Second Phase, an efficient MIS would be defined and set up
in the three OMVs selected to participate in the proposed
"tprogram-contract" process (para. 6.09).  The MIS would include cost
accounting, budgeting and financial planning and control. 37
man-months of specialized technical assistance would be financed
under the Project to this effect. The system would be first designed
and tested within OMVVM, the largest Tunisian OMV then introduced in
the other two OMVs participating in the "program-contract"
experiment. Considerable emphasis would be put on the involvement of
OMVs staff in the design of the system and the training of this staff
during the MIS start-up period. In addition, each of the three OMVs
would recruit a full-time financial planning and control specialist
(controleur de gestion) for a period of two years. This specialist
would be financed under the Project. He would have full operational
responsibilities within the Office and be directly accountable to the
General Director. He would be responsible for the start up of a
Budgetary Control and Internal Audit Unit within the OMV and for the
training of his counterpart staff; and
(c) In a Third Phase, the new MIS would be introduced in the remaining
seven OMVs. Because the system would have already been defined and
tested in three OMVs, considerable economies of scale would be
possible.
6.07     Detailed timetable and terms of reference for this program are
presented in Annex 11 of the Implementation Volume. Thne definition of the
necessary basic accounting principles and procedures is e prerequisite to the
development of a new MIS for OMVs and to the establishment of a
"program-contract" process. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the
Government would issue no later than December 31, 1985 an interministerial
circular defining the necessary accounting principles and procedures,
acceptable to the Bank.   About three man-months of technical assistance would
be necessary and would be financed retroactively under the proposed Bank
loan. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that (i) all OMVs would
establish and submit to the Bank, before April 30, 1986, their opening
financial statements as of December 31, 1985; (ii) the three financial
planning and control specialists (para. 6.06) would be recruited before June
30, 1986; and (iii) the new MIS would be operational in the three OMVs
participating in the "program-contract" process before December 31, 1986, and
in all other OMVs before June 30, 1987.
6.08     Financial and Budgetary Procedures.  OMVs' budgetary procedures would
be rationalized. Their activities would be separated into (a) public services
(extension), for which OMVs would receive full compensation from the
Government; (b) commercial services (input distribution, tractor services,
marketing) whose costs would be fully borne by the beneficiaries and for which
OMVs would not receive any operating subsidies; and (c) irrigation activities
for which OMVs and Government would determine, through the Offices' respective
negotiated development plans, the (declining) annual subsidies to be provided
by Government (para. 6.10). Annual operating subsidies would therefore be
negotiated, activity-specific and not transferrable between activities, with
targets established for internally generated funds and operating cost
coverage. Finally, funding for OMVs' irrigation maintenance operations would
be clearly earmarked in their annual budgets, in amounts satisfactory to the
Bank. Assurances were obtained at negotia:ions that the above arrangements
would be adopted.

C. Planning and Monitoring of OMVs' Activities
6.09     Program-Contract Process.  A key feature of the Project would be the
preparation and implementation, first by three OMVs selected for their
representativity (OMVVM, Kairouan and Gafsa), of program-contracts (PCs)
negotiated with the Govermment. The program-contract process would require
each of the three OMVs to prepare a detailed medium-term development plan
covering the period of the forthcoming Seventh National Development Plan
(1987-91). The development plans would identify the Office's objectives in
terms of investments, projected evolution of its various activities (water
distributed, farmers contacted per extension agent, etc.) and its targets in
terms of management improvement (setting up new MIS) and productivity
improvement (unit cost of services). It would also indicate the corresponding
financial requirements and the anticipated sources of financing. Each OMV
would be responsible for the preparation of its development plan. To do so,
they would receive the support of external technical assistance financed under
the Project to (a) prepare physical development plans; and (b) prepare the
matching financing and budgeting plans and define appropriate financial and
budgeting procedures. OMVs not participating in this PC experiment would
however also prepare detailed medium-term development plans (plans
d'entreprise) to be discussed with and approved by the Government (Annex 5).
6.10     OMVs' detailed development plans would be approved by their Board of
Directors, then negotiated with the Coordinating and Monitoring Committee
(para. 6.04). The agreed upon development plans, including the corresponding
financing plan, of the three selected OMVs would then form the basis for the
establishment of the "program-contracts" between the concerned OMVs and the
Government. The contract would set forth OMVs' obligations with respect to
goals and performance (including precise, monitorable performance indicators)
and Government's obligations concerning institutional and regulatory matters
(in particular staffing and pricing) as well as financial commitments
(subsidies, grants) based on projected investment programs and operating
revenues. The program-contracts would be signed by the Offices and the
Government (Annex 5). The PC experiment, if fully successful, could be later
extended to other OMVs.
6.11     Monitoring of the implementation of the development plans and the
program-contracts would be carried out by the NCC and DPSAE, on the basis of
annual progress reports prepared by the OMVs. A consolidated report would be
prepared by DPSAE for submission to NCC and the Bank, analyzing OMVs'
performance and recommending, if necessary, the measures and reforms deemed
appropriate. The Plans and Contracts would be subject to systematic annual
review based on previous-year performance and new unforeseen circumstances.
Annex 5 of the Implementation Volume outlines the main features of the
"program contract" process and the detailed performance indicators that would
be used to monitor OMVs' activities.
6.12     Government's agreement to introduce for the three selected OXVs, the
program-contract process outlined above has been obtained in a Policy Letter
addressed to the Bank. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the
draft of medium-term development plans of all OMVs - including proposed
staffing programs to be reached by end 1989 (para. 6.13), pricing policies and
If



-31-
performance indicators - and program-contracts where applicable would be
submitted to the Bank for review before September 30, 1986 and that the final
plans and contracts would be approved and signed before March 31, 1987.
6.13     Personnel Policv.  An important element of the preparation of OMVs'
respective development plans would be the definition of a detailed medium-term
staffing plan aimed at improving staff productivity and decreasing the cost of
OMVs' services. Through zero-base budgeting, a medium-term target would be
determined, on the basis of expected levels of activity and productivity
objectives, for the number of staff and the technical skills required in each
OMV. The staffing plan would also define the measures necessary to achieve
the target structure within a specified period, including attrition,
restricted recruitment of certain categories of personnel, transfers and
training programs.
D. Promotion of Water User Associations MWUAs)
6.14     Measures would be introduced to promote the increased role of WUAs in
the management of PPIs by: (a) providing for more effective operating
procedures for existing AICs; (b) defining the legal framework necessary for
the creation of smaller, more flexible WUAs established under private law; and
(c) introducing adequate incentives to ensure the promotion of the WUAs. The
revival of existing AICs requires a major overhaul of the 1936 decree defining
their statutes and by-laws to decentralize operational responsibilities and
simplify the present highly rigid management procedures. A draft of a revised
decree governing AICs' operating procedures is being prepared by the MOA and
is expected to be approved by December 31, 1985.
6.15     In parallel with the overhaul of the legal framework and operating
procedures of AICs, which would remain very structured bodies ruled by public
management procedures (collectivites publiques), would be defined the legal
framework for the creation of smaller, more flexible WUAs established under
private law to (a) take responsibility for the operation and maintenance of
small irrigated areas (small pumping schemes or quaternary channels of large
gravity perimeters); and (b) be the counterparts of OMVs for the management of
irrigation perimeters and resolving disputes. The grou lwork necessary for
the establishment of these new WUAs is being carried out under the
Bank-financed Central Tunisia Irrigation Project (Loan 2234-TUN). Under that
Project, new WUAs would be created in the PPIs of the OMVs of Kairouan and
Kasserine (ODTC), which would gradually take over full responsibility for O&M
of small perimeters under an agreement with the concerned Office. Under the
terms of the agreement, the OMV would commit itself to (i) guarantee the
necessary supply of water; and (ii) maintain and operate the more
sophisticated electromechanical equipment and provide technical backstopping
for other O&M operations carried out by WUAs. The farmers would agree to (a)
pay progressively higher water charges aiming at full recovery of O&M costs;
(b) protect and maintain the irrigation distribution system; (c) assume
increasing responsibility for water management; and (d) contribute to a fund
to finance major repairs executed by the Office on behalf of the farmers. The
present Project would oxtend to the whole of Tunisia the dispositions being
tested under the Central Tunisia Irrigation Project.



-32-
6.16     Specific measures would be taken to promote the creation of WUAs:
(a) farmers benefitting from a rehabilitation of their irrigation system would
be grouped into WUAs and enter into a contract with the OMV concerned as
described above; and (b) voluntary creation of WUAs would be encouraged by
charging a lower price for water to farmers belonging to a WUA than to
individual farmers, the rebate representing the decrease in cost borne by the
Office due to farmers participation in O&M. This rebate would be eliminated
in case of farmers' non-compliance with agreed upon obligations.
6.17     The Government has indicated its commitment, in a Policy Letter, to
promote the role and responsibility of WUAs in the management of irrigation
perimeters. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that: (a) the Government
would, no later than December 31, 1985, take all necessary measures acceptable
to the Bank to provide for more effective operating procedures for AICs; and
(b) the definition of the legal framework for the creation of the proposed new
type of WUAs and for their contractual relationship with OMVs and the proposal
by Government of specific measures (including those recommended in para. c. .6
above) for their implementation to promote the creation of WUAs would take
place no later than December 31, 1987.
E. Technical Asistance and Traimng
6.18     Two types of TA activities are foreseen under the project:
(a) institution support to OMVs through the strengthening of DCOMVPI
(paras. 5.16 and 6.02); and (b) MIS and management control assistance to OMVs,
and support to DPSAE in financial planning/control (paras. 5.16, 6.03 and
6.06). Consultant service requirements are summarized in the following table:

Grand Total                                 -----308-----
The terms of reference and costs are detailed in Annex 11 of the Implementation
Volume. The core team of long-term experts located at DCOMVPI would be
provided through a multiannual twinning arrangement between DCOMVPI and an
institution in charge of the actual O&M of irrigation perimeters, and with the



-33-
relevant experience and know-how. The twinning partner, as vell as individuals
or consulting firms selected to carry out any long- and short-term assignment
would be acceptable to the Bank, regardless of the sources of financing.
6.19     Training. An essential element of the TA program would be to train
OMVs and WOA's (DPSAE, DCPPI) staff. Training would be done partly through
action-oriented seminars and partly through on-the-job training, either within
OMVs themselves or at the facilities of the twinning partner. All staff with
management responsibilities would be involved in specific training programs.
All levels OMVs' O&M field staff would receive in-service training to upgrade
their technical skills. Training objectives, needs, priorities, programs and
responsibilities are detailed in Annex 3 of the Implementation Volume.
6.20     Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the long-term technical
assistance to assist DCOMVPI and DPSAE would be recruited no later than
January 1, 1986.
F. Moaitodrin and Evajution
6.21     Monitoring and Reporting.  The Project Manager (para. 6.02) to be
appointed in DCOMVPI would be responsible for monitoring Project
implementation, including physical and institutional and policy objectives,
along the lines of the key indicators presented in Table 8. He would prepare
semiannual progress reports to be submiutted to the Bank. DPSAE would prepare
annual reports, to be submitted to the Bank, on the implementation of OMVs'
medium-term development plans  and annual operating plans, budgets and
financial results, and on the evolution of performance indicators selected
under their respective "program-contracts" or development plans (para. 6.09).
DCOMVPI and DPSAE would also prepare jointly a Project completion report
within six months of the closing date. Assurances to this effect were
obtained at negotiations.
6.22     Mid-term Review.  Because of the nature of the proposed Project, with
its heavy emphasis on institutional and policy reforms, the Tunisian
Government and the Bank would carry out a mid-term review of the
implementation of the Project before December 30, 1988. This would involve a
review of the physical implementation of the Project and of the progress
accomplished in meeting its policy reform objectives, in particular in the
areas of strategic and operational planning, budgeting, accounting and
financial management, personnel management, pricing policies and cost
recovery, and OMVs' operational efficiency and financial autonomy.   As an
input to this review, a management audit would be carried out, at the end of
FY87, for the three OMVs participating in the program-contract process and the
Government would prepare, by June 30, 1988, a report outlining progress,
issues and recommendations, and this report will include a specific plan for a
smooth transition throughout the technical assistance wind-down period and
thereafter. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations.
G. Accounts and Audit
6.23     DCOMVPI, which would have overall coordinating responsibilities for
project implementation, would set up a Project Information System to maintain
all Project related accounts, in accordance with sound accounting principles,
from the start of Project implementation. The Project would finance the cost



-34--
of establishing the system. Project accounts would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank along with the statements of
expenditures sent to the Bank for disbursements under the Bank loan. Audited
financial statements would be submitted to the Bank, with the audit report,
within six months after the end of each fiscal year. Assurances to this
effect were obtained at negotiations.
6.24     OMVs would establish their opening financial statements as of
December 31, 1985, according to the new standard accounting principles (para.
6.06). These statements and the subsequent annual financial statements would
be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The auditors'
annual long-form reports including an assessment of OMVs management
efficiency, and audited financial statements would be sent to the Bank within
six months afteir the end of each fiscal year. Assurances to this effect were
obtained at negotiations.
VIIL BENEFITS. JUSTIFICATION.AND R-SKS
A. Benefts and Beneiaries
General
7.01     The project would result in the improved operation and maintenance of
some 105,000 ha of public irrigation schemes in Tunisia and permit increased
and sustained agricultural production from these areas. The direct
quantifiable benefits of the Project would arise mainly from (a) cost savings
through the avoidance of repeated investment for the rehabilitation of
irrigation infrastructures; (b) increased agricultural and livestock
production induced by the more reliable delivery of water supplies in the
irrigated areas covered by the project which would also improve farm incomes
and employment in the public irrigation schemes; (c) direct foreign exchaage
savings; and (d) improved financial situation and autonomy of the OMVs which
would have a positive impact on the Government budget. Non quantifiable
benefits would include the institution-building impact of the project on the
OMVs, with a strengthening of their overall management efficiency, the
increased farmers' participation in operating and maintaining part of the
irrigation systems, thereby minimizing management burden on the OMvs, and the
promotion of the private sector role in providing agricultural services (input
supply, farm mechanization, marketing).
Rehabilitation Cost Savings
7.02     By improving OMV's capabilities to maintain properly existing
irrigation infrastructure, the present need for repeated investments for its
early rehabilitatiou could be largely eliminated. At present, the average 
life of irrigation equipment and infrastructure in the PPIs is less than half
what it should be under normal maintenance conditions (networks presently have
to be rehabilitated once every 10 to 15 years, whereas a properly maintained
network can last 40 to 45 years). The average rehabilitation costs in Tunisia
are in the range of D 900 to D 1,200 per ha ($1,100 to 1,500/ha). At a 12%
discount rate, the net present value (NPV) of two rehabilitations in years 15
and 30 is D 225/ha. The cost of an adequate maintenance of the networks
estimated at about D 24/ha/year on average (see Annex 8), instead of the



-35-
D 8/ha/year which are presently allocated on average for that purpose. The
NPV of the incremental funds necessary to ensure proper maintenance of the
system is D 130/ha,'' or only about half that of the rehabilitation costs.
On the basis of actual rehabilitation cost and life spans of major equipment
in Tunisia, it is estimated that the NPV of rehabilitation cost savings
achievable in the PPIs through adequate maintenance, discounted at the
opportunity cost of capital (12%) over Project life, would amount to about
D 48 million (US$60 million). Details are presented in Annexes 15 and 16.
Production and Resource Use
7.03     Production and Yields.  Increased water availability and distribution
efficiency would result in an intensification of irrigation and an increase in
production. The exact increase in water use and production are however
difficult to estimate for an O&M project of this nature. Since the Project
focuses on the organization and management of the OMVs and on the operation
and maintenance of the irrigation schemes, without directly reinforcing the
agricultural support services, it has been assumed that farmers would keep the
same production system and cropping pattern and use the increased volumes of
water made available at the farm level and the better timeliness of deliveries
to increase irrigation intensity and achieve higher productivity and yields on
currently grown crops. This hypothesis represents a "worst case" scenario
which does not take into account onfarm development generated by an
improvement of agricultural support services, extension in particular. A
strengthening of extension efforts, currently being undertaken in most OMVs in
particular under Bank-financed projects, should lead to a shift toward higher
value crops and improved technologies, resulting in additional production.
However, this has not been taken into consideration to estimate the benefits
of the present Project. The projected increases in yields and farm production
as a result of improved O&M under the Project have been set at conservative
levels: max;imm yields projected at full development are already being
obtained by progressive farmers in PPIs and only a small portion of farmers
have been assumed to reach that level (para. 7.26). The table below presents
a su-nary of yields and production increases under the Project. Details are
in Annex 12.
7.04     At full development (year 20 of the Project), the value of annual
incremental production generated by the Project-' is estimated at D 23.9
million (US$29.8 million), of which D 23.3 million (US$29 rillion) for crop
production (an increase of 17% over "without project situation") and D 0.6
million (US$0.8 million) for livestock production (an increase of 26% over
"without project situa' ion"). The annual incremental value-added to the
economy at full developmentz-' would be D 11.2 million per annum
(US$14 million).3'"

lj Cropping intensity (39S) is highter than irrigation intensity (pWa. 3.0Z) because of crops ouunder rainfed conditions in the PPIs

Id It has been assumed that farmrs would not change their cropping patterns as a result of the project. but only lntensify their existing
crops.
7.05       Marketing.  The incremental production generated by the Project would
consist essentially of fruit and vegetables, sugar beet, fodder, milk and
meat. Based on past trends and projected income and population growth in
Tunisia, domestic demand for fruit and vegetables is projected to outpace
supply. The Project's incremental vegetable production (73,000 tons over 20
years, or a growth of about 2Z p.a.) would be readily absorbed by domestic
demand. Past trends in domestic fruit consumption (excluding exported crops
such as citrus) suggest that local demand will also increase faster than
domestic production. The marginal increase in stone fruit production under
the Project (19,000 tons over 20 years or a growth of about l.5Z p.a.) would
be absorbed without problem by the domestic market. Fruit and vegetables in
Tunisia are distributed through a well-established and competitive private
market which is not subject to significant Government control. Total citrus
production in Tunisia is estimated at 198,000 t and is concentrated in the Cap
Bon area (80Z). Production has been increasing since 1973 (107,000 t) but
fluctuates widely from year to year (220,000 t in 1977, 160,000 t in 1979).
Per capita consumption has been increasing rapidly with income over the last
decade, and annual domestic demand is presently estimated at 160,000 t. The
balance (about 20Z of total production) is exported, mainly to France.
Marketing facilities for citrus are well developedL' and the incremental
production generated by the Project (35,000 t after 20 years or an increase of
about 0.8Z p.a.) would be easily absorbed by the domestic and export markets.
1/ 15 grading/packaging and cold storage units with a total capacity of
160,000 t are located in the Cap Bon area, and eight more units with
an annual capacity of 40,000 t are located near Tunis.

7.06     Tunisia currently imports 952 of its sugar needs (about 200,000 tons)
and the incremental production of sugar beet under the Project (10,000 tons or
about 1,500 tons of sugar equivalent at full development) would therefore find
a ready market. Two sugar mills, operating below capacity, are located in the
area where that incremental production would be generated (Jendouba). Strong
existing demand for fodder crops would absorb the Project's incremental
production (25 million FU). Project-generated fodder crops would be an
attractive replacement for high-cost alternatives such as feed concentrate of
which prices have more than doubled in the past few years with the gradual
elimination of subsidies on those products. Approximately 200,000 tons or
only about half of Tunisia's annual milk consumption of about 400,000 tons is
provided by local sources, while the balance is met from imports of skim milk
powder and butter oil reconstituted into fluid milk. The full development
incremental production under the Project (2,000 tons or 5% of current
consumption) would therefore substitute for imports. As for meat, incremental
production under the Project is negligible (182 tons).
7.07     Prices.  Although, traditionally, the farm-gate prices of many
agricultural products in Tunisia have been administratively set at low levels
compared to world prices, prices of most irrigated crops (fruits and
vegetables) are freely determined on the domestic markets and have been kept
high by a strong domestic demand. rn addition, substantial subsidies are
provided for most modern inputs, widely used in irrigated areas. The
combination of high producer prices and input subsidies makes production of
most irrigated crops very remunerative. The producer prices of the irrigated
crops subject to Government price controls (sugar beet, milk, cereals) have
recently increased faster than inflation and the price of necessary inputs.
Government has recently taken measures to increase producer prices of milk and
beef to satisfactory levels. They are now in line with world prices and
provide adequate incentives.
Farm incomes
7.08     To quantify the financial costs and benefits of the Project to the
42,000 Project farmers concerned and evaluate the cost recovery policy
(paras. 7.12-7.20), 28 farm models representing the main farm sizes and
farming systems in the 10 OMVs have been prepared based on detailed studies
including: (a) typology studies which categorized farm parameters; (b)
surveys of land holdings and cropping patterns; and (c) information on
production potential, land use capability and production technologies. The
technical characteristics of the farms models are summarized in the table
below and presented in detail in Annex 12.
7.09     Since farmers are not expected to change their cropping patterns as a
result of the Project (para. 7.03), the full development incremental incomes
generated by the project reflect a higher farm productivity level under the
same production system made possible by increased water availability and
improved operation of the networks. Only a small proportion of farmers in
each OMV have been assumed to reach that level (para. 7.26). The table shows
that the potential financial gains provide adequate incentives for the farmers
to participate in the Project.

Femployment benefits
7.10           Employment on the benefitting farms (about 42,000) would-increase by
about 5.6 million man-days per year at full development, which is equivalent
to the creation of 23,000 full time jobs. About 65S of this would represent
additional family labor, and 352 additional hired labor on medium and large
farms. Given the nature of the Project, incremental employment generated by
the rehabilitation works would be negligible.
Direct Foreign Exchange Savings
7.11           Based on projected world market prices, expressed in constant 1984
prices, the annual foreign exchange value of incremental tradable production
at full development (year 20) is estimated at US$14.8 million. After
deduction of the foreign exchange costs of the incremental traded inputs used
in agricultural production (seed, fertilizer) of about US$3.4 million per
year, the direct net foreign exchange savings attributable to the Project's
incremental production would total about US$11.4 million per year at full
development. In addition, the net foreign exchange savings induced by better
maintenance of irrigation systems and rehabilitation cost savings (see
para. 7.11) can be estimated at US$3.8 million per year on average during the
life of the Project. Discounted at the opportunity cost of capital (122) over
Project life (20 years), direct foreign exchange savings would have a net
present value of US$36 million.

B. Financial hImpact
Cost Recovery
7.12    OMVs' Commercial Services.  In 1982, the total cost of OMVs'
commercial activities were about D 2.8 million. These costs were only
partially offset by revenues of D 1.6 million, a cost recovery rate of 57%.
In the short term, the primary objectives of the Project would be to reach
full cost recovery for OMVs' commercial activities. In the medium-term, the
main objective would be the divestiture by OMVs of their commercial
activities. This divestiture, however, can only be done gradually as the
Offices have so far discouraged private sector initiatives in their command
areas by providing their services at subsidized prices so that alternative
delivery mechanisms do not currently exist at a satisfactory level in the
project area. The removal of these subsidies is therefore the first step to
foster competition. Under the Project, full costing of OMVs commercial
services (including overhead costs) would be introduced. However, this
requires, as a prerequisite, the establishment of an efficient MIS within OMVs
to determine the real cost of these services which would be achieved by end
1986 (para. 6.07). In the interim, and to immediately improve their financial
position, OMVs wouLd, starting in January 1986 (a) align their rates for
custom mechanized services with those of the national mechanization agency
(SONAK);"' (b) charge the official distribution margins where applicable
(fertilizers) and apply a minimum 10% mark-up on the price of the other inputs
they distribute; and (c) apply the official margin for milk marketing
activities and a minimum 10% margin on marketing operations for other products.
7.13     The Government has committed itself in a Policy Letter addressed to
the Bank, to (a) adopt the interim measures above as of January 1, 1986; and
(b) divest OMVs of their commercial activities in the long term. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that the Government would introduce full costing
of commercial services no later than December 31, 1988.
7.14     O&M Cost Recovery.  To achieve the Project's objectives of full O&M
cost recovery and more rational use of water resources available, the
following measures would be introduced under the Project: (a) a binomial
water rate structure; and (b) a gradual increase of water charges in real
terms to reach full O&M cost recovery. Details are in Annex 13 and the major
elements are outlined below.
7.15     Water Rate Structure.  The system to be introduced under the Project
would be based on a binomial formula, composed of (a) a compulsory fixed
annual contribution on a per irrigable hectare basis charged to every farmer
regardless of the amount of water used and representing a minimum level of
consumption (1,500 to 3,000 m3/ha), which would encourage water use up to
the level chosen (by indirectly increasing unit costs for farmers using less
than the minimum recommended allowance) and also guarantee OMVs with a minimum
revenue per irrigable hectare; and (b) a flat volumetric water charge to be
applied for volumes used above the aforementioned fixed term.
1/ SONAM currently charges between D 4.3 and D 4.6 per hour for tractor
services, which compares with their actual operating costs estimated at D
4.5/hour.

7.16     Schedule of Water Charge Increases.  The Government has agreed in
principle to the target of full O&M cost recovery. The full cost of water in
1995 (based on projected O&M costs and water consumption) has been computed
for each OMV with and without project. Although total O&M cost would be
higher with project, reflecting the improved O&M, unit cost of water would
decrease due to the projected increase of water consumption (table below).
Under the project water charges would be increased by at least 9% per year in
real terms until either the breakeven price or farmers' ability to pay is
reached. Present and projected unit costs and charges (without and with
project) are in the table below, along with the year during which breakeven
would be reached. Full O&M cost recovery would be reached in four OMVs
covering some 65Z of all PPI's area before the end of the Project (Gabes,
Gafsa, Jendouba and Medjerda); between 1992 and 1995 in three other OMVs
(LakhmOs, Nabeul and Nebhana), while in the three Offices located in Central
Tunisia (Kairouan, ODTC and Sidi Bouzid), farmers' limited expected income may
not permit full recovery of O&M costs in certain of the irrigation schemes
being managed by these Offices covering less than 5% of all PPI's (para. 7.19).

/a Full o0M recovery appears limited by current assessment of farmers' ability to pay (para. 7.18).
7.17     The Government has indicated its commitment in a policy letter to
(i) introduce a binomial water charge structure for water charges; (ii)
increase water charges by at least 9% p.a. in real terms through 1995; and
(iii) reach full O&M cost recovery, in all Offices, within the maximum period
of ten years, taking into consideration farmers' ability to pay.
7.18     Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Government would
take all necessary measures acceptable to the Bank, to (i) promote the
adoption of the new water charge structure in all OMVs (except the oasis);



-41-
(ii) introduce the binomial structure in ONVM and OV Jendouba no later than
December 31, 1985 and June 30, 1986 respectively; (iii) achieve full O&M cost
recovery except in OMVs in the center part of the country by January 1, 1995;
and (iv) to this end, raise water charges by at least 9X p.a. in real terms in
all OMVs.
7.19     Farmers' Ability to Pay.  Project's incremental incomes and rent for
farmers already benefitting from irrigation would be modest and would not
represent the real incremental incomes and rents due to irrigation (comparison
between rainfed and irrigated situation).   The determination of possible cost
recovery levels based on project-induced incremental incomes and rent would
therefore not be meaningful and lead to very small acceptable increases in
water charges. The assessment of farmers' rent due to irrigation and ability
to pay has therefore been based on the widely applied principle that water
charges should not exceed 20S of gross farm revenues or 301 of net income from
irrigated crops. Current water charges represent 1l to 91 of gross revenues
and 21 to 121 of net incomes of representative farms. Based on the analysis
of representative farm models (Annex 13), farmers' ability to pay may prove a
constraint to full O&M recovery in some irrigation schemes managed by three
OMVs (Kairouan, ODTC, Sidi Bouzid) with present farming and cropping
systems.-'  Rowever, shift to higher value crops and more productive
technologies, due to extension efforts, would increase farmers' income and
ability to pay and the possible level of O&M cost recovery. Under the
Project, OMVs would set up a permanent system to monitor farm incomes and
farmers' ability to pay of representative farms in their respective command
areas (details are in Annex 13 of the Implementation Volume).
Impact of the Proiect on OMVs' Financial Situation -
7.20     The measures proposed under the Project on pricing and cost recovery
for OMV's services and irrigation water, along with efficiency gains in the
delivery of those services, would have a highly beneficial impact on the OMVs'
financial situation, and sharply reduce Government subsidies. For their water
distribution activities, the combination of changes in tariff policy
(introduction of a binomial water charge structure). price increases and
declining unit costs of delivery would yield a total net incremental revenue
estimated at D 86 million (US$115 million) over the 1986-1995 period (constant
1984 dinars). The cumulated projected deficit would accordingly be reduced
from D 124.6 million (US$155.7 million) without project to D 38.6 million
(US$51.5 million) with project (Table below). Breakeven for water
distribution would be reached between 1990 and 1995 in seven OMVs, the
potentially remaining deficit being in those OMVs where farmer's ability to
pay may not allow for full recovery of irrigation O&M costs in all PPIs (para.
7.19). For commercial services, total cost recovery in all OMVs by 1988 would
1/  These OMVs manage numerous, small PPIs.  The ongoing Bank-financed project
implemented with these OMVs (Central Tunisia Irrigation Project - Loan
2234-TUN) for which strict economic and financial criteria were applied is
concerned only with those PPIs where full O&M cost recovery will be
possible.



- 42 -
yield a net incremental revenue over the 1986-95 period of D 33.6 million
(US$42 million), in constant 1984 dinars. Overall, OMVs' cumulated operating
deficit for water distribution and commercial activities over 1986-1995 would
be reduced fourfold. Cash flow projections are sumanrized in the table below.
Impact of the Project on Government's Budget
7.21            Government revenues due to the Project will accrue from incremental
tax revenues on farm income and staff salaries, import duties on equipment,
excise and other t,-xes on farm inputs and OMV recurrent expenditures,
agricultural sale taxes on incremental farm production and Bank loan
disbursements. Outflows related to OMV financing include investment costs of
the project, salaries for staff in the central advisory bodies (DCOMVPI and
DPSAE at the Ministry of Agriculture), water and commercial operating deficits
of the OMV (since these deficits are either considerably lower or non-existent
in the "with project" situation they represent in fact a negative outflow),
subsidies on incremental farm inputs consumed (fertilizers) and debt service
on the Bank loan. The net positive impact of the Project on Government's
finances would amount to D 32.2 million (US$42.9 million) in current terms
over the first five years of the Project (1986-90); it would increase
considerably in years 6 to 20, with net annual surpluses ranging (in 1990
prices) from D 17 million (US$22.6 million) in 1991 to D 25 million (US$33.2
million) in 2005. The Government project-related cash flow is shown in Table
7 and details are in Annex 15.

C. Economic AnalysS
7.22     The analysis of economic benefits duv to the Project shows that for
an economic rate of return of 15% to be achieved only a very small increase in
production (4.0%) induced by the Project would be required over the life of
the Project in addition to the substantial benefits from rehabilitation cost
savings described albove (para. 7.02). In some Offices, this ERR would be
achieved on the basis of rehabilitation cost savings alone (OMVVM, Gabes) or
with an increase in production of 2% or less over the life of the Project
(Jendouba, Gafsa, OMIVAN).1' A more traditional zoproach to Project's
economic analysis consists of taking both rehabilitation cost savings and the
full expected incremental crop and livestock benefits into account and testing
the impact of various combinations of adverse assumptions on the economic
viability of the Project under this approach. The overall economic rate of
return of the Project calculated in this way was estimated at 29%. It was
calculated by aggregating the ERRs for the 10 individual OMVs, which range
from 19.6% to 36.4%. This alternative approach is presented below and
developed in Annex 16 of the Implementation Volume.
Benefits
7.23     Benefits consist of (a) the rehabilitation cost savings resulting
from the improved operation and maintenance of the irrigation systems; and (b)
the value of incremental crop (except fodder) and livestock production
generated by the Project, expressed in economic prices. Secondary benefits to
the economy (employment creation, foreign exchange savings) are described in
paras. 7.10 and 7.11. Benefits such as energy savings in the pumping stations
due to improved operation and maintenance of the equipment have not been
quantified. Rehabilitation cost savings correspond to investments that would
have to be made without the Project as a result of poor operation and
maintenance of the systems. They have been estimated separately for each OMV
on the basis of actual rehabilitation costs and historical investment life of
the irrigation systems in Tunisia. It has been assumed that, even with the
improved operation and maintenance under the Project, the average life of
irrigation investments in Tunisia would still remain below standards and only
50 to 80% of the actual rehabilitation costs (over and above normal
replacement costs) could be avoided and therefore counted as project
benefits. The crop and livestock benefits are based on the assumptions
regarding production presented in para. 7.03. The net agricultural benefit
streams for each OMV are based on the aggregation of the net incremental
income for each farm model with all cost and benefits converted in economic
prices. It has been assumed that, in the "without project" situation, water
use and production would slightly increase (see Table in para. 7.03 and Table
5). Substantial crop losses avoided because of better security of water
supply, in particular in Central and Southern Tunisia (tube wells), which can
be estimated at about one-third of the production every three years, have not
been identified separately and are assumed to be embodied in the overall
incremental increase of production in each of the OMVs concerned in the "with
Project" situation.
Costs
7.24     Investment costs include all Project irrigation civil works, stocks
of irrigation equipment, O&M equipment, hydro and electromechanical
1/ See sensitivity analysis.



-44-
rehabilitation, radio and computing equipment, technical assistance and the
replacement of equipment at normal intervals during the life of the Project,
all expressed in economic terms. The assumed economic life for canals, tube
wells, hydromechanical equipment, electromechanical equipment, and vehicles is
30, 20, 15, 10 and 5 years, respectively. All investments to date in the
various OMVs were treated as sunk costs. Operating costs include the
incremental operation and maintenance costs of the irrigation networks at the
level deemed adequate to avoid frequent rehabilitations, and the incremental
farm production costs, all valued in economic terms.
Project Life and Benefit Build-up Period
7.25     Project life has been assumed to be 20 years.  All construction works
(in Medjerda only) and equipment procurement would be completed in four
years. Build-up rates of agricultural benefits have been set at very
conservative levels (Annex 12). Crop and livestock production would increase
by 33Z over the life of the Project, of which only 18X can be attributed to
the Project itself. Although about 801 of the farmers are expected to
participate in the Project, only about 201 would reach full development by
year 20. Farmers' participation is assumed to start in the second year of the
Project, as soon as O&M improvements start to materialize. The detailed
phasing of farmers' participation and farm development patterns by OMV and
farm model is detailed in Annex 12 and sununrized below.

For the estimation of rehabilitation cost savings, a distinction has been made
for the analysis between the recently rehabilitated or new networks and the
non-rehabilitated networks within each OMV.
Economic Prices
7.26     The economic prices used to value investment and operating costs in
the economic analysis were derived from the 1980 study of shadow prices and
economic policy in Tunisia, updated to reflect recent price adjustments.
Traded agricultural inputs and outputs have been priced at import or export
parity prices as derived from IBRD commodity forecasts for 1990, or from other
sources, when necessary with adjustments made for freight, handling and
processing in Tunisia. Non-traded commodities have been adjusted by the
relevant conversion factor. Most of Project costs, except for farm inputs



-45-
such as fertilizer and machinery services, have a low accounting ratio
(financial price3 higher than their economic costs). The low ratios reflect
the high indirect taxes and tariffs, import quotas and the excess of wages for
unskilled labor above their opportunity cost.
7.27     The economic rates of return of Project investments and net present
values of net economic benefits for the 10 OMVs are indicated below:

The economic rates of return are satisfactory for all OMVs. The differentialz
in economic viability among OMVs are linked to (a) variable production
response to improved operation of the irrigation systems, with the response
being maximum in those OMVs where the marginal return per m3 of water is the
highest because of a present poor security of supply or overall scarcity of
water and high value output (Gabes-Medenine, Gafsa, Nebhana and Nabeul); and
(b) the variable importance of costs avoided because of improved operation and
maintenance, with costs avoided being the highest for those OMVs where
irrigation systems are based on more sophisticated irrigation equipments which
are more risk-prone to breakdowns (deep tube wells in the oasis, large pumping
stations in Medjerda and Jendouba).
D. Risks and Sensitivity Analysis
Risks
7.28     The main potential risks which could adversely affect the economic
viability of the Project are: (a) a lower than expected production response
(incremental crop and livestock benefits) to increased availability and better
timeliness of water delivery in the PPIs, which could result from either the
incapacity of the OMVs to translate the technical and managerial improvements
introduced into a more efficient operation of the networks or the predominance
of major constraints other than adequate and timely water availability at the
farm level; and (b) lower than expected rehabilitation cost savings because of
suboptimal use by the OMVs of the technical assistance, training,
organizational improvements and maintenance equipment and facilities provided
under the Droject.



-46-
Sensitivity Analysis
7.29         Sensitivity tests carried out on the basis of the preceding adverse
risks show that the resulting economic rates of return remain satisfactory and
the Project remains viable even in the unlikely event that all 10 OMVs would
be affected simultaneously. As could be expected, the economic viability of
the subprojects in each OMV and of the Project as a whole is more sensitive to
change in benefits than changes in costs. A simultaneous and very significant
reduction in production and rehabilitation cost savings benefits (50%) would
still yield acceptable rates of returns for most of the subprojects and for
the Project as a whole (13.9%). Switching values show that crop and livestock
benefits would have to fall by 90% or rehabilitation cost savings be 138%
lower than expected to reduce the Project's economic rate of return to the
assumed opportunity cost of capital of 12%. Similarly, investment and O&M
costs would have to jump by 236% and 247% respectively to threaten the
economiic viability of the Project. Such adverse changes for these critical
parameters are very unlikely. The results of the sensitivity analysis are
summarized below.

Land Ownership and Aararian Reform in PPIs
1.       Ownership Limitation.  The Agrarian Reform Laws provide for upper and lower limits
for the area of irrigable land that may belong to one owner. Any land exceeding the upper
limit is subject to expropriation.]. The actual limits have been established by decree. on
the basis of soil capabilities and anticipated cropping patterns. to guarantee a minimum
income to the farm family. However. land ceilings have often been set after taking into
consideration the existing distribution of holding size. so as not to require any major
change in ownership. Where such changes were required. as in the Lower Medjerda Valley
(LMV). actions to limit farm sizes have met with strong resistance from farmers.
2.       Land Consolidation.  To date, some important progress has been achieved particularly
in LMV. OHVYM has carried out land consolidation Zf over about 10.000 ha. which represents
two-thirds of privately held land in the LMV I/ and consolidation of the full 15.000 ha
should be completed before 1986.  The remaining equipped area is represented by State land or
former State land distributed to settlers. and does not need consolidation. HOA and ARAPPI
have so far consolidated some 40.000 ha in PPIs outside LMV. Government land consolidation
efforts have been impaired by the fact that consolidation operations often followed. instead
of preceded. completion of irrigation infrastructure and. as a result, faced technical
difficulties as well as opposition from farmers.
3.       Obligation to Irrigate.  Under existing legislation. farmers must irrigate at least
two-thirds of their irrigable land after a two-year grace period from the time irrigation
water first reaches their field. At present while average irrigation intensities have
reached or exceeded the legal miniumun requirements (67X) in most PPIs. many farmers do not
comply with this obligation. Although the laws envisaged the imposition of penalties on
farmers in case of non-compliance. the Government has so far failed to impose adequate
penalties.A/
4.       Contribution to Investment Cost.  In the LHV. the law provides that an owner of more
than 2 ha of irrigable land has to contribute to irrigation investment costs. Contributions
range fron 25X to 70X of the value added to the land because of irrigation, depending upon
land productivity category. Similar dispositions apply in the other PPIs. So far however.
little has been recovered from Agrarian Reform settlers (about 0 53.000 or lOZ of fees due)
and none from private farmers in the LMV. Recovery in other PPIs has not yet started because
in many cases farmers are still within the grace period allowed or because legal dispositions
have to be finalized.
1/ Except in LMV where land is not expropriated if the owner pledges to maintain irrigation
intensities above a minimum level (67X).
O/ OMVVM is entrusted with carrying out land reform activities in the LMV. while the "Agence
de la reforme agraire dans les perimetres irrigues" (ARAPPI) of the Ministry of
Agriculture is responsible for the perimeters outside LMV.
3/ The total equipped area is about 32.000 ha.
4J  In the LMV. farmers are only assessed a D S/ha annual penalty for each hectare which does
not meet a minioum requirement, as compared with a value of irrigated production varying
from 0 1.500 to more than 0 3.000/ha.
