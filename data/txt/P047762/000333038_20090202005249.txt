F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project's development objective was to ensure access to improved and sustained
water and sanitation services in rural communities in Tanzania.            This would be
accomplished through the implementation of the new Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
(RWSS) sector policy and the preparation of a National RWSS program. To this end, the
Project would support a decentralized and demand responsive delivery mechanism and




                                              ii

help build the institutional foundation for implementing the National RWSS Program
both at the central and local government levels.

1.       Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1      Context at Appraisal

1.1.1    Country Context. The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project was designed to support
several key development objectives of the Government of Tanzania as part of the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS). The Project supports the CAS objective of reducing poverty and improving
the health condition of vulnerable groups in rural settlements, the Government's Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the Tanzania Assistance Strategy (TAS) with regard to increasing Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) services coverage. The launch of the Project on October 15, 2002 in Dar
es Salaam was planned to coincide with Tanzania's launching of the National Water Policy (NAWAPO
July 2002). NAWAPO was designed to contribute to the realization of Vision 2025 and the National
Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction (NSGRP) targets.                     The Project was also designed to
contribute to GoT's decentralization policy under the Local Government Reform Program (LGRP) and the
development of the private sector in the water and sanitation services as well as contribute to the control
of HIV/AIDS and better sanitation.

1.1.2       Structural/Sector Background. Rural water supply service delivery has undergone several
phases since the "free water" policy of 1967. In the early 1970s, significant investments were made in the
RWSS sector. However, it was only possible to provide access to a reliable water supply service to about
50% of the rural population. Due to poor maintenance arrangements, a significant percentage of RWSS
systems built during that era are not currently functioning. In the 1980s, investment levels were low and
support by donors was usually provided in a fragmented fashion. Most RWSS projects were implemented
directly by the Ministry of Water (MoW1) through programs funded by donors. Schemes were also
operated by MoW and later, by default, by communities themselves. The first wave of reforms came
about with the National Water Policy (1991). This policy marked a clear departure from the era of "free
water" of 1967 and initiated the principle of cost sharing between GoT and communities. The policy also
initiated the transfer of responsibility to operate and maintain RWSS schemes to village water
communities. This opened up the path for the Revised National Water Policy (2002). The new Policy, on
which the current Project is based, emphasizes: (a) a demand-responsive approach whereby communities
choose service levels and appropriate technology based on their perceived needs and ability to pay; (b) an
upfront contribution of capital costs and full financing of Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs by
communities as a means to foster ownership of the project; and (c) implementation and management of
schemes by communities with the assistance of local governments, NGOs and the private sector. A
significant contribution of the 2002 National Water Policy was the changed roles for the GoT and the
private sector in water supply and sanitation delivery. The disengagement of MoW central operations
from direct identification, management, construction and operation of RWSS schemes and the
development of capacities within District Water and Sanitation Teams (DWSTs), Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs), consultants, contractors and suppliers were the key institutional reforms that the
Project sought to support.

1.1.3       Rationale for Bank Assistance. Bank assistance in the Sector sought to provide GoT with the
supporting framework and resources for sustainable service delivery. The design of RWSS was informed



1 The original agreement was with the Ministry of Water and Livestock Development (MoWLD). In 2006, the Ministry became
the Ministry of Water (MoW), and in 2008 became the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MoWI). For consistency in this
document, the Ministry shall be referred to as the Ministry of Water (MoW).




                                                               1

by World Bank experience of what worked elsewhere under similar conditions and would likely work
under Tanzanian conditions. Bank involvement was informed by: (a) a review of selected bilateral and
NGO managed projects in Tanzania, carried out during the preparation of the RWSS policy; (b) regional
experience; (c) lessons from global experience compiled during the global RWSS conference held in
Washington in May 1998; (d) results of project preparation work; and (e) inputs from the Bank's RWSS
Thematic Group. The alternative instruments explored included; (i) the use of a Learning and Innovation
Loan (LIL); (ii) combining activities under Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF), (iii) the use of an
Adaptable Program Lending (APL). The use of a LIL in three districts was initially considered. However,
given the size of the country as well as the amount of preparatory work carried out, GoT considered that a
Project focusing on only three districts would not provide enough lessons for scaling-up to the National
RWSSP. Combining activities under TASAF was considered but dropped because Social Action Funds,
even though they enable strong community ownership, have proven to be inadequate instruments to
reform sectors, develop sector institutions and sector capacity in both the public and private sectors. The
use of an Adaptable Program Lending (APL) was also considered, but believed to be a better instrument
to implement the National RWSS Program that should follow the proposed Project. With an informed
background, the right instrument and the resources needed, the Bank was well placed to support the
Project.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.2.1   The Project's development objective was to ensure access to improved and sustained water and
sanitation services in rural communities in Tanzania. This was to be accomplished through the
implementation of the new Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Policy and the preparation of a
National RWSS Program. To this end, the Project sought to support a decentralized and demand-
responsive delivery mechanism and help build the institutional foundation for implementing the National
RWSS Program both at the central and local government levels.

1.2.1   Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were:

     Decentralized and demand-based district implementation model validated and operational in up to
        12 districts;
     Water supply and sanitation conditions improved in about 250 communities located in up to 12
        Project districts; and,
     National RWSS Program and Strategy endorsed by key stakeholders.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and reasons/
    justification

1.3.1   No formal restructuring was carried out under the project. At the Mid-Term Review in March
2005, however, it became apparent that some measure of corrective restructuring was needed. The PDO
and project components were maintained but a number of key indicators (number of communities and the
number of beneficiaries) were adjusted. This was in conformity with the demand responsive nature of the
Project and slow start up and capacity constraints encountered. It also became apparent that the initial
estimates were ambitious when weighed against interpretational problems with definition of a community.
Most communities include 4-6 sub-villages surrounding a core registered community. This definition
increased the scope of activities to be carried out in a community and the estimated beneficiaries per
community. The sub-project cycle and community consultation process followed by the project, resulted
in changes in community preferences from hand pump systems to mechanized piped system which were
more expensive.      To stay within the Project budget, the target of 250 communities was revised
downwards to 133 communities but this did not reduce drastically the targeted beneficiaries. Based on



                                                    2

this assessment and with the growing number of more complex mechanized piped systems, the Bank
approved a GoT request for an 18-month extension of the project. This extended the Closing Date to
December 31, 2007. A further extension of the closing date to June 30, 2008 was effected in order to
ensure successful completion of the outstanding project activities. It also allowed for extensive capacity
building of districts for scaling up of RWSS services under the proposed Water Sector Support Program
which was then under preparation.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1      The primary beneficiaries of the Project were to be about 650,000 people living in about 250
rural communities and small towns of less than 15,000 in 12 districts, covering an area the size of
neighboring Uganda. Women and children who typically spent long hours fetching water of doubtful
quality would be the prime beneficiaries of the Project. An additional benefit for the Project was the
creation of an enabling environment and capacity for launching a National RWSS Program. As noted
above, both the number of rural communities and the initial target beneficiaries were scaled down from
250 to 133 and from 650,000 to 550,000 respectively at Mid-term Review.

1.5     Original Components (as approved). The Project had three main components:

1.5.1      Component 1 - Establishment of the District Implementation Model. (estimated at US$1.20
million): This component was initially started in the three districts of Rufiji (Coast Region), Mpwapwa
(Dodoma region), and Kilosa (Morogoro Region), and gradually expanded to 9 other districts out of
Tanzania's 113 (now 136) districts. Activities included: (a) support to the establishment and strengthening
of operational capacity (equipment support and training) of District Water and Sanitation Teams
(DWSTs) to prepare district RWSS plans and to appraise RWSS sub-projects proposed by communities;
(b) support to the establishment of district RWSS funds (a sector conditional grant system) to finance the
construction of new RWSS schemes, the rehabilitation and expansion of existing systems and other water
related small scale investments, and (c) assistance to communities in the proper management and
operation of these systems as well as promoting HIV/AIDS mitigation and prevention activities.

1.5.2      Component 2 - Construction of RWSS Community Sub-Projects. (estimated at US$21.30
million): This component consisted of sectoral conditional grants to about 250 (revised to 133)
communities located in 12 districts to improve the WSS service. These included (a) construction or the
rehabilitation of existing dug or drilled wells, (b) boreholes equipped with hand pumps or powered
pumps, and (c) spring tapping, piped systems, household latrines and community sanitation facilities.
DWSTs would employ facilitation service providers (NGOs) for community Facilitation Services
Providers (FSPs) and Technical Services Providers (TSPs) for sub-project design and construction
supervision. This component was also to support the setting up of a network of private retail outlets for
the distribution of spare parts for hand pumps. In addition, a network of certified maintenance hand
pumps agents were also to be deployed in the beneficiary districts. The component also included an
"innovation window" for exploring community contracting where possible, or technologies and
management arrangements not tested in Tanzania.

1.5.3      Component 3 - Institutional strengthening and development of a National RWSS Program.
(estimated at US$3.55 million). This component includes; (a) support to stakeholder consultative process
on the strategy for scaling up towards a National RWSS Program; (b) technical assistance to the
preparation of the National RWSS Program; (c) the development of a Management Information System
(MIS) for tracking lessons learned from the proposed Project; (d) assistance to the restructuring of RWSS
sector institutions within MoW and (e) the building of the capacity of key stakeholders (MoW, NGOs,
consultants, contractors, suppliers of equipment and service providers). This component also included



                                                     3

dedicated RWSS sector capacity building support to the IDA-financed Tanzania Social Action Fund
(TASAF) project districts; as well as assistance to MoW for overall management of the Project.

1.6      Revised Components

1.6.1    All three components were maintained. However, the relative shares of resources originally
allocated to the Project components were revised in light of the shift in community demand from the hand
pumps to mechanized piped systems as well increased demand for capacity building ahead of the scale up
of the National RWSS Program.

1.7      Other significant changes

1.7.1    The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was amended thrice for the following reasons:
 To raise the Special Account Allocation to accommodate the increased project activities from 3 to 12
    districts. The authorization allowed an amount equivalent to US$ 3.0 million to be withdrawn from
    the Credit Account and deposited in Special Account (December 02, 2005).
 To extend the Closing Date and to address: (a) change in the name of the implementing agency
    resulting from the splitting of the Ministry of Water and Livestock Development into two ministries;
    (b) re-allocation of the Credit Proceeds among the eligible categories as well as support of preparation
    activities towards the scaling up of rural water supply and sanitation activities country-wide under the
    proposed follow-on operation in FY 07 (Water Sector Support Program); and (c) revision of the
    Performance Monitoring Indicators from 250 communities to 133 communities (March 8, 2006).
 To Extend the Closing Date to June 30, 2008 as per Section 2.03 of the credit agreement (July 17,
    2007).

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry. ICR Rating: Satisfactory. This Project
was not assessed by Quality Assurance Group (QAG) for quality at entry. Supporting evidence of the
rating is as below;

2.1.1    Adequacy of the Government Commitment. RWSS was identified by GoT as one of the pillars
for poverty alleviation and rural development. The National Water Policy's core principles (efficiency,
subsidiarity and integration) were supportive of the objective of the decentralized delivery of water and
sanitation services. Furthermore, MoW had taken the initiative to reorganize its Rural Water Supply
Division (RWSD) to fit its new role as facilitator and coordinator. A preliminary institutional analysis
aimed at restructuring the RWSD was carried out. MoW successfully prepared the project including:
Environmental and Social Assessment and Mitigation Plans; Financial Management Plans (FMP),
procurement documents and Project Operation Manual (POM); detailed project management
arrangements; and identification of sub-projects to be implemented during the first year in the first 3
districts.  The first three pilot districts demonstrated their commitment to the Project by actively
participating in preparation and by substantially strengthening their DWSTs. Communities also
demonstrated commitment to the RWSS program. Due to past efforts, most communities in Tanzania
already had a WSS committee and a WSS Fund in a local bank.

2.1.2    Stakeholders' Involvement. The Project, from its inception, benefited from extensive dialogue
with the GoT and stakeholders, starting as far back as 1996. The process initially concentrated around the
studies leading to the revision of the National Water Policy in 2002. GoT exhibited strong ownership in
formulating the National Water Policy in a participatory manner. A Technical Advisory Committee




                                                      4

(TAC) was set up to provide oversight at preparation and this function was carried out through Project
implementation.

2.1.3    Soundness of the Background Analysis. The preparatory activities underpinning the Project
design focused on two key elements; (i) core principles arising out of the National Water Policy and (ii)
extensive field studies and surveys. The core principles (efficiency, subsidiarity and integration) are all
derived "best practice" lessons from the sector over the last two decades. Detailed field studies and
community surveys were also carried in the first three districts to refine the sub-project cycle, test the
tools for community engagement and detail out the indicative first year investment program. The
structuring of the project to start first in 3 districts before expansion to additional 9 districts proved to be
an important design feature of the Project.

2.1.4    Assessment of the Operation Design and the Risks. Given the change from centralized and
supply-driven project environment to decentralized and demand responsive implementation arrangements,
anticipated risks were identified as follows; (i) potential limited commitment of the RWSD to its new role
as facilitator and support agency; (ii) limited implementation capacity of the DWST and private sector;
(iii) delays in the release of counterpart funds. Mitigating measures were put in place to reduce these
anticipated risks in the course of implementation. Nevertheless, most of these risks materialized during
implementation in one form or the other. One risk which was not anticipated was that, with a typical
decentralized demand responsive project, one cannot predict accurately community preferences and
choices. The assumption that communities will rationally prefer cheaper hand pumps as opposed to more
expensive mechanized piped schemes proved to be the reverse. As a result, within the budget envelope,
the Project had to work in fewer communities and achieved fewer water points even though the
correspondent decrease in population served was not drastic.

2.2      Implementation. ICR Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

2.2.1    Steep Learning Curve. Given the novel nature of the decentralized implementation approach, the
Project faced a steep learning curve. As anticipated in the risk assessment, project implementation started
slow. Disbursement by Mid-Term Review was 22%. This initial underperformance was attributed to
teething problems and to the nature of the demand driven process. The fact that the area covered by the
Project is about the size of neighboring Uganda and that some of the sub-project sites were inaccessible
during rainy seasons represented some logistical challenges. Some of the boreholes drilled did not yield
adequate water or were dry. This contributed to the extended delays and cost overrun. However, it is in
the nature of demand responsive projects for things to pick up slowly. The multiple impacts of the new
policy principles meant that one needs to spend more time with communities as well as creating the
environment for private sector delivery of goods and services which was not available in numbers and
quality desired. It is apparent that one cannot definitively predict community preferences and choices
especially in an environment where communities share in capital cost and have to take responsibility for
operation and maintenance.        DWSTs were new institutions and thus experienced slow capacity
development. The severe capacity constraints manifested themselves initially in; weak coordination
between MoW and districts; inadequate coordination between DWST and service providers and
implementing agents and MoW; delays in fund flow management; weak procurement administration as
well as slow adaptation of implementation agents (MOW staff, district officials, local consultants, NGOs
and contractors) to the scale and pace of the Project.

2.2.2    Proactivity - Learning and Adjusting to Implementation Conditions. After the slow start, MoW
found it necessary to introduce changes, to provide time and resources for the extensive capacity building
at the local government level not only for the Project but also to meet the challenges due to the scaling up
of RWSS services under the proposed Water Sector Support Program. This was accomplished in two
parts; (i) technical audit and evaluation of performance leading to the corrective restructuring at Mid-


                                                         5

Term Review. The Implementation Progress status was downgraded to "Unsatisfactory" in November
2004. The target number of communities was revised downward to focus the effort on a manageable
number of communities without a significant decrease in the targeted beneficiaries; and (ii) the re-
organization of the RWSD and mainstreaming of the Project into the working arrangements of the RWSD.
This brought the full force of the MoW institution for rural water supply to bear on the implementation of
the Project and by extension prepared the MoW for the roll out of the National RWSS Program.
Implementation results started becoming evident after the Mid-Term Review. The action plan yielded
more positive results; disbursement improved; construction activities picked up speed; and the Project
was mainstreamed into the activities of the RWSD of the MoW. Consequently, the project's
implementation progress was upgraded first to "Moderately Satisfactory" in December 2005 and
subsequently to "Satisfactory" in March 2006. Despite the difficulties, the implementation phase of the
Project led to improved capacity building and successful achievement of the expected outputs and
outcome with positive impact. The strategy of starting in 3 districts before expanding into all the 12
districts made its mark. The prize is a good project outcome but the cost is an extension of 2 years to
have it accomplished. The project duration of 6 years is however not unreasonable for projects of this
nature, taking into account the weak institutional base and the spread of activities over a large area.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization. ICR Rating:
Moderately Satisfactory

2.3.1    Project Monitoring and Reporting Tools.         From inception, the Project management team
developed and deployed to all districts and for use of the head office, templates for technical and financial
monitoring. These templates were included in the Project Operational Manual. These were field tested
and updated for inclusion in both the Community Training Manual and the District Operational Manual.
All DWSTs, FSP, TSP and Community Water and Sanitation Committees were trained in the use of the
templates. These templates cover (i) project application forms, (ii) Facility Planning and Management
forms, and (iii) monthly reporting forms. These were used by communities to report to the district level,
DWSTs to report to the MoW and for the MoW to report to the Bank as and when needed and during
supervision missions.

2.3.2    Computerised MIS Development. The Project assisted MoW with the development of MIS and
M&E protocol. Installation was completed at MoW head office and in 9 districts where they are now
operational. Training has been carried out in all 12 districts and baseline data collected for most of the
communities in the 12 districts. Data input, however, was very slow, thus limiting the full potential of the
MIS in effective planning and M&E. Most districts continue to use spreadsheets as well as the project
monitoring and reporting tools mentioned above as a back up and are thus able to report on activities as
and when needed without the benefit of full automation.

2.3.3    Annual Technical and Financial Audits. Annual technical and financial audits were designed
into the Project as an additional monitoring instrument to measure quality of processes, systems and
facilities implemented under the Project.

2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1    Safeguards (Environment). ICR Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. An Environmental
Assessment (EA) and a Social Assessment (SA) were conducted for the three pilot districts (Kilosa,
Mpwapwa, and Rufiji) prior to project appraisal. These assessments covered potential impacts from
drilling of boreholes and expansion and rehabilitation of existing facilities as well as current waste
disposal situation and the incremental effects of increased water supply in the communities. Based on
these assessments, mitigation measures in the related safeguards were developed for the three initial
districts and the Project in general. The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was part of the Project


                                                     6

Operational Manual and included an EA checklist for screening community sub-projects as well as a
checklist of monitoring indicators. The EMP was applied to all project districts. Each supervision mission
especially after the Mid-Term Review included a detailed Annex on monitoring of EA and SA safeguards.
Overall, districts followed adequate environmental screening during site selection and sub-project
implementation.

2.4.2    Procurement. ICR Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. Procurement requirements were complied
with but significant delays experienced on some sub-projects. Contracts which were not subjected to prior
review were subjected to post review. For post review contracts, relevant documents were retained by
both districts and MoW for Bank's review during supervision missions or audit by a consultant selected
by the Bank. A major procurement post review was also conducted in June 2007 and confirmed good
practice overall despite some noted delays in processing and inadequate filling in some cases.

2.4.3    Financial Management. ICR Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. Financial management reviews
at the district level were carried out by MoW periodically and confirmed during Bank supervision
missions. The objective of the reviews was to ascertain the status and adequacy of the Project's financial
management arrangements and its compliance with legal covenants related to financial management.
During the reviews, the following aspects of the Project's financial management arrangements were
covered: budgeting, staffing, accounting system, accounting policies and procedures, record keeping,
financial reporting, internal control systems, internal and external auditing arrangements, flow of funds
(including banking arrangements). The Borrower met it counterpart financing obligation. Project funds
transferred to districts were largely accounted for. However, during the course of implementation, some
districts experienced delays in funds transfer which hampered timely execution of works in some
instances.

2.4.4    Disbursement Management. ICR Rating: Satisfactory. Despite initial delays, progress in
disbursement progressively improved after the Mid-Term Review. The entire Credit was used up by the
Project closing date and within the stipulated period for settlement of claims within the defects liability
period.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1    Consolidation of the District Implementation Model.           The establishment of the district
implementation model proved demanding. With concerted effort, most of the weaknesses were mitigated
and substantial institutional capacity has been created to the point that satisfactory performance was
observed at closing. However, strengthening institutions should be seen as an ongoing process with a
significant learning curve.       Some communities in the districts have devised better operational
arrangements which promise sustainable funding of operational and maintenance arrangements. The
operational arrangements likely to be sustainable include those which allow the community to hire an
operator to operate and maintain the water pump and collect the water user fees. Water and Sanitation
Committees and Water Funds as well as arrangements for collecting user fee to meet operation and
maintenance needs of built systems are now an established practice in all Project beneficiary communities.

2.5.2    Continuity under the Water Sector Development Program. The change in policy from
"provision of RWSS services", which did not work in the past, to the "facilitating and financing of RWSS
services", which has been successfully tested using a district implementation model, has not been easy.
The latter has so far proved promising and could deepen the decentralized provision of sustainable water
and sanitation services in which the community has a stake in the planning, design, and efficient operation
of the services. While attaining sustainability requires protracted and constant learning and adaptation,
the institutionalization of the district implementation model is expected to provide over the medium-term,
a more sustainable model than the tried and failed centralized model of provision of RWSS services,

provided the policy incentives continue to be appropriate. The roll out of Project results under the
National RWSS Program which is part of the follow-on Water Sector Development Program represents a
strategic opportunity for consolidation of "best practices" generated under the Project and an even greater
opportunity to continue with needed capacity enhancement of DWSTs and community groups. The
consolidation of the private sector's role in the delivery of maintenance support services will also benefit
from this continuity.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation. ICR Rating: Satisfactory

The Project has proven relevant and consistent with the current Tanzanian Country Assistance Strategy.
The relevance has been demonstrated over the life cycle of the project as follows:
 The new National Water Policy's core principles (efficiency, subsidiarity and integration) have been
    validated through the implementation model developed and tested in the 12 districts. The model has
    been adopted in the National Water Sector Development Strategy (2007) and has been the basis of the
    RWSS component of the Water Sector Development Program.
 The key operational arrangements of the Project (decentralized participatory implementation
    management, redefinition of the role of MoW; capacity building at the district level; and, enhanced
    role for the private sector) are now established practice in Tanzania.
 The Project experience has also impacted the implementation of the National RWSS Program which
    was formulated under the Project. The Program is now operational in most districts and implemented
    under the Water Sector Development Program since July 2007. This is a major contribution to GoT's
    National Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction.
 The experience gained under the Project has significant importance to Country Assistance Strategy
    not only to Tanzania but also in the rest of Africa where Bank implementation assistance remained
    important in guiding the transition of changing roles of central government, local governments and
    communities in the provision of sustainable service delivery.

Activities have been on-going in all districts for both school/community sanitation and sanitation
marketing. These outputs helped the formation of hygienic habits and the capacity to meet the demand
created by the awareness. The main activities include:

 School Hygiene and Sanitation: construction of demonstration latrines and hand washing facilities;
    formulation and training for school and community health and sanitation clubs as part of hygiene and
    sanitation education.
 Household Sanitation Marketing: extensive training of fundis (artisans) in manufacturing and
    installation of hygienic sanitation slabs (SanPlats). During the training, the activities included; (i)
    Development of training package (training manuals, posters, and leaflets), (ii) Training of over 540
    fundis from all 12 districts, (iii) Production of almost 3,000 SanPlats with over 1,600 installed (43%),
    and (iv) Formation of 30 SanPlat production centers.

3.2.3      Component 2: Construction of RWSS community sub-projects (estimated at US$21.30
million; ICR: US$ 21.78 million). Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

This component had four activities and all were satisfactorily implemented and their outputs contributed
to the overall outcome of the project. However, it took an additional 18 months extension of the Project to
complete most of the activities. The implementation of this component helped reduce distance and travel
time to fetch water and increased coverage of water and sanitation services.

Activity 2.2: Supply Chain-Hand Pump and Spare Parts Supply. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The
supply chain was designed to cover 3 Business Units. Morogoro Municipality, Dodoma Municipality and
Singida Town were selected as central zonal depots to serve the nearest districts. Certified technicians
have been appointed and trained for each of the districts. This activity is related to the sustainability of the
outcome and impact of the project by deepening the local market for post construction after-sales services
and spare parts provision. The activity experienced significant delay and therefore the Project did not
realize its full impact by the closing date but is receiving attention under follow up Water Sector
Development Program which seeks to establish a national network beyond the boundaries of the Project.

Activity 2.3: Supervision, Design and Construction Supervision. Rating: Satisfactory. The design and
construction supervision activities are critical for the quality, efficiency and sustainability of the water
and sanitation sub-projects. Over 10 consulting firms (TSPs) and extension support NGOs (FSPs) were
engaged by districts to support communities and DWSTs in preparing sub-projects, carry out the detailed
designs and supervise the construction. In some districts, support to experimentation of post-construction
management was realized. Mpwapwa district's innovation in local operators for piped schemes is
noteworthy. Their experimentation is one that should be nurtured and emerging lessons and experiences
widely disseminated to other districts and communities. In some districts some cost overruns resulted
with the extension of the sub-project completion time but overall the activity was successfully and
professionally carried out.

Activity 2.4: Support to Innovation Window Program. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. In November
2005, the MoW signed contracts with 10 consultants/service providers to implement 10 sub-projects
under the Innovation Window, which are collectively considered to be the applied research and
development component of the Project. The sub-projects focused on: sanitation and health; information
and communication technology; management of water supply and productive use of water. Progress to
completion was reported to be 98%. Although the selected offers were apparently the best at the time of
selection, some of the sub-projects lack innovativeness. Furthermore, ownership and information
dissemination of the results of any innovations as originally planned, needs to be followed up by MoW.

3.2.4   Component 3: Institutional Strengthening and Development of the National RWSS Program
(estimated at US$3.55 million). Rating: Satisfactory

The activities under Component 3 were designed to lay the necessary foundation for sustainability and
scale up of the project outcome and made a positive contribution to the outcome of the project.

Activity 3.1: Support to Stakeholder Consultative Process. Rating: Satisfactory. The Project was formally
launched with a stakeholder workshop on October 15, 2002 in Dar es Salaam. To ensure the engagement
of stakeholders, the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) comprising multi-sector and disciplinary
stakeholders has been active during the life of the Project. About 10 TAC meetings were conducted
during the life of the Project. The TAC was mainstreamed into the work of Water Sector Working Group
(WSWG) and the Thematic Groups in July 2006. This is part of the sector dialogue mechanism set up for
the Water Sector Development Program.

Activity 3.2: Technical Assistance to the Preparation of the National RWSS Program. Rating:
Satisfactory. The Project Management Support (PMS) consultant was mobilized in May 2003. The
consultant assisted GoT to undertake: demand assessment; prepare the capital and O&M costs and
investment forecasts; training and capacity building strategy; training manuals; and carry out annual
technical audits as well as provide guidance for the mainstreaming of the Project into the activities of the
MoW. All these culminated into the drafting of the National RWSS Program as well as the preparation of
the consolidated Water Sector Development Program. The consultant also prepared the district grant
allocation guidelines, and completed the design of the MIS.

Activity 3.3: Development of a Management Information System (MIS) for Tracking Lessons Learned
from the Project: Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. A computerized MIS was developed and pre-tested
and installed in all districts. The MIS has modules for community information; water supply sub-project
preparation; sanitation sub-project information; contract administration; water fund collection; financial
management; as well as modules for accessing water supply and sanitation coverage by community, ward,
district, and region. The development of the MIS encountered delays. It is operational in 9 districts but
with mixed results in its utilization. Two staff from each district were trained in the use of the system.
However, due to delays in the development of the MIS, a back up system consisting of monitoring and
reporting templates (spreadsheets) as well as annual and financial audit were resorted to most of the time
by communities to report to districts and for DWST to report to MoW.

Activity 3.4: Assistance to the Restructuring of RWSS Sector Institutions within MoW and the Building
of the Capacity of Key Stakeholders (MoW, NGOs, consultants, contractors, suppliers of equipment and
service providers). Rating: Satisfactory. This activity prepared the capacity building strategy and tools
which were used in the implementation of the decentralized implementation model. Extensive capacity
building activities and training events were organized at all levels and a significant number of training
manual and tools were prepared. These were used in the course of the Project and are now being used to
support the rolled out National RWSS Program. Private sector capacity was also promoted under this
activity. The biggest contribution was the opportunity for private sector contractors and service providers
to bid competitively for provision of works and services at the district level. To date, the Project has
promoted the use of: 53 local small works contractors; 13 drilling companies; 10 mechanized pump
suppliers and maintenance agents; 2 hand pump suppliers and maintenance agent; 4 consulting firms
(TSPs); 540 sanitation artisans, and many NGOs (FSPs). The Project also provided training for some of
the FSPs to improve their outreach approaches. Some firms also obtained supporting grants through a
leasing arrangement under the Project to procure well sitting equipment and other construction
accessories.

Activity 3.5: Assistance to MoW for overall management of the Project. Rating: Satisfactory. The
district implementation model became functional. Project Coordination Unit at MoW was dissolved, two
years into the Project and project management streamlined/integrated into the activities of the restructured
RWS division of the MoW. Activity has been merged into the implementation of the National RWSS
Program.

3.3      Efficiency

3.3.1    Methodology. Post-construction evaluation of the economic benefits of RWSS investments were
carried out using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The details are outlined in Annex 3 and
include the following:

    1. Cost- Benefit analysis based on time saving obtained with the implementation of the schemes for
         each type of technology


                                                    12

    2. Cost 춅ffectiveness relative to the design assumption for each type of technology utilized
    3. Qualitative assessments of beneficiaries

3.3.2   Cost benefit-analysis. Economic analysis was conducted for the various alternatives on the basis
of actual post construction data obtained from the districts. The approach used to estimate the Economic
Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and Net Present Value (NPV) is similar to the one used at appraisal,
except that instead of seven options considered at appraisal, the options used in the analysis were three:
gravitational water scheme; shallow borehole with handpump; and mechanized deep borehole with piped
scheme.

     Reappraisal Results: All alternatives resulted in positive EIRR ranging from 16% for shallow
        wells with hand pumps, 18% for mechanized deep boreholes and 49% for the gravitational
        scheme;. The NPVs were all positive at 12% discount rate.
     Sensitivity analysis conducted: As at appraisal, sensitivity analysis conducted for the following
        scenarios: (a) a 10% increase in investment costs; (b) a 20% decrease in time savings; and (c)
        30% decrease in price of vended water. The analysis shows that the options undertaken are all
        viable, providing rates of return ranging from 49% to 16% for the base case. In the sensitivity
        analyses, the shallow well rate of return is marginally below the 12% discount rate if the time
        savings are reduced by 20%, while the result is positive for the other scenarios.

3.3.2   Cost-effectiveness. The design assumptions for each type of technology utilized were tested on
sub-projects in the 3 pilot districts as well as those in the 9 additional districts. The results show that on
the average investment in US$ per cubic meter of water per hour was US$205,685 for bore holes,
US$62,247 for shallow wells; and US$19,346 for gravitational scheme.

3.3.3   Qualitative assessment of beneficiaries. Annex 3 summarizes a range of perceived benefits
expressed by beneficiaries in one of the villages - the benefits of water range from health, increased
agricultural production, academic achievement, strengthening family, freedom, gender equality,
socialization of children, healthy livestock, cleanliness, generosity, freedom from fear, and hope!

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome. Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1   Project Outcome Achieved. Overall, achievements of the project outcome are assessed as
satisfactory. The project objective and design remained relevant. Sector issues included in the
implementation model such as: decision making process, sub-project appraisal, cost sharing arrangement,
financing mechanisms, district council contracting, incentive to deliver, private sector participation,
linkage with water resource management, and crosscutting issues such as HIV/AIDS were addressed
adequately during design and implementation and valuable lessons were learnt.

3.4.2   Scale Up Ensured. The implementation model piloted under the project helped to secure
stakeholder agreement and endorsement of the National RWSS program and its subsequent commitment
to financing (estimated at USD 390 million). The countrywide roll-out to the Project model since July
2007 is a testimony to the Project's success. The scale up represents an important ingredient meeting the
objective of GoT's National Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction, i.e. to ensure sustainable access
to improved RWSS services. Achievement of the Project Development Objective is therefore assessed as
satisfactory.

3.5.1    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development .The impact of RWSS on poverty,
gender and social development is assessed to be significant. The impact on poverty was not fully
quantified, but a qualitative assessment backed by field observation indicates that significant time-saving
in fetching water is being utilized in agricultural production or non-agricultural production or service
activities. It has facilitated the emergence of new division of labor other than the traditional subsistence
farming with potential future productivity gains. The gender impact is also positive since women and girls
are often the ones who fetch water. Moreover, women have become the pillar of the WSS communities in
their respective villages. School attendance among girls, was reported as having significantly increased. A
total of 521,630 (against the MTR revised target of 550,000) people got access to water with substantial
reduction in distance traveled as a result of the Project. The time to access water was also reduced
significantly. The risks to women being exposed to rape or contracting HIV, or unplanned pregnancy,
attacks by wild animals and snakes were reduced. Women have now more time to care for themselves
and their children and children are not left alone in the home while their mothers go to fetch water.
Sanitation services have improved and the risks of communicable diseases are reduced. Better homes are
being built now that water is available. People have become more creative at using their saved time.
Women's participation in community affairs other than WSS committees has also increased.

3.5.2    Institutional Change/Strengthening. The Project has contributed significantly to strengthening
institutional capacity at all levels of government through a series of reforms. MoW has been restructured
to allow for decentralized delivery of services. Government water sector policy has been updated to allow
for an enabling environment and appropriate incentives for the delivery of reliable, sustainable and
affordable water supply and sanitation services. The role of GoT in the new Water Sector Policy has
shifted from the "provision of RWSS services" to the "facilitation and financing of RWSS services". The
ownership of assets and the responsibility for deciding on RWSS rehabilitation/extension programs and
the establishment of cost recovery arrangement have become district responsibilities; while management
of day to day operations of the system has become the responsibility of community water user entity or
the private sector. Incentives for sustainable RWSS operations have been put in place. Private sector
participation in the rural water and sanitation services has been enhanced. The GoT has put in place a
framework and an incentive environment for private sector participation. Local Governments can now
design affordable and sustainable private sector participation activities. However, despite such progress,
the process needs to be consolidated. The follow on Water Sector Development Program represents a
great opportunity.

3.6      Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey. Although the ICR is a Core ICR, as part of the
learning process to position the extension/scale up of the program, a Beneficiary Survey was undertaken.
Survey results suggest substantial benefits from successful sub-projects. The summary of findings is as
follows:

 A number of sub-projects cover large populations from targeted villages and sub-villages. The
    quality of service is generally considered of a high quality by communities. The collection of
    community contributions varies substantially between districts  irrespective of the absolute size of
    required contributions, thus suggesting scope for extending best practice strategies from the most to
    the least effective districts.
 Capacity has been built in District Water Departments as well as in some communities. District Water
    Engineers (DWEs) and communities in general are able to solve technical problems as they occur.
    Average repair time varies from district to district, but problems are generally solved within a couple
    of weeks. Broken pumping equipment and sometimes pipes and valves, take a little longer. Three of


                                                     14

    the surveyed schemes had no functional water points. In all cases problems reflect issues in project
    implementation rather than post-construction maintenance and repair. To increase the quality of
    works, it might be beneficial to strengthen district capacity in contract management and quality
    control. The share of non-functional water points was high for shallow wells in Rufiji District, where
    problems of ground water salinity are common. Interviewees in two schemes plagued by repeated
    breakdowns and low quality of services indicated that the community was now unwilling to pay for
    water as well as repairs. It is possible that stronger assessment of community demand should have led
    to investment in deep wells under such difficult groundwater conditions, or perhaps, not being
    pursued if communities preferred resorting to traditional sources of water if challenged by higher
    water fees.
 In districts where large piped schemes operating "pay-as you fetch" payment system are prevalent, all
    schemes seem to be able to cover operating costs. Financial sustainability is low in flat rate schemes
    and shallow well facilities. Embezzlement of Village Water Funds is also a problem for collection of
    initial community contributions, as well as for revenue collected from the selling of water. The
    prevalence of these problems, and the negative impact they have on the sustainability of schemes,
    suggest that the DWSTs have an important role to play as a check on community leadership to raise
    financial sustainability.
 Mpwapwa District has pioneered the drafting and application of Village Water Fund By-Laws
    regulating the collection, keeping and use of Village Water Fund, which if extended to other districts
    would likely raise sustainability of established schemes. Innovation around private operation of
    schemes also from Mpwapwa District should be extended to other districts, as experiences show
    higher revenue generating capacity in these schemes.

                                          Results from Mpwapwa District
     District Water and Sanitation Teams are in place, and Water and Sanitation Plans have been prepared based
         on community demand;
     15 Village Water Schemes - mostly piped schemes - have been completed;
     Coverage has increased from 45 to 74%, meaning that 90,000 additional people are now served with
         improved water supply;
     67 out of 84 water accounts are kept with total deposits equaling almost Tsh 21.5 million;
     1,791 people have been sensitized on better hygiene education and sanitation behavioral change, 58 latrines
         holes have been constructed, 2 school sanitation clubs have been established and 132 SanPlats have been
         sold  of which 117 have been installed;
     7 contracts with Private Sector Operator's have been signed; and 5 additional contracts are currently under
         processing.

3.6.2    Summary of Findings of Stakeholder Workshops. Discussions on the Project's main
achievements and the biggest challenges faced were informed by detailed presentations by District Water
Engineers (DWEs). The main findings can be summarized as follows:

 The Establishment of a Decentralized Project Implementation Model, including the successful
    redefinition of the relationship between the MoW, Local Government Authorities (LGAs) and
    Communities was identified as one of the main achievements.
 Capacity building in Districts through the posting of Water Engineers and the establishment of
    District Water and Sanitation Teams (DWST) was identified as another main achievement.
 Community participation was emphasized as an important element in project implementation, as this
    has led to greater ownership of water facilities.
 Participants emphasized the visibly large impacts successful sub-projects are having on rural
    livelihoods in terms of lower water collection time and improved health.
 Participants at the workshop also made recommendations on the need for: proactive role of district
    engineers; strengthening post construction management of community water schemes; adopting the


                                                       15

     example of Mpwapwa district in water Fund management; and adoption of private sector for large
     rural water supply schemes.

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome. Rating: Moderate

4.1      The risk in achieving the development outcome of the Project is assessed as Moderate. GoT has
already adopted the district implementation model and scaled it up across the country under the follow up
Water Sector Development Program.            Over the next 5 years, RWSS services will be expanded
significantly in Tanzania. The lessons learned from the Project have, by and large, been incorporated in
the scale up program. Some simplification has been made in the flow of funds by adopting a tested system
of fiscal transfers to districts. This Local Government Capital Development Grant system was developed
under the on-going parallel project - Local Government Support Project. Only districts that met the
qualification criteria receive water and sanitation conditional grants. The scale up program is however
massive. It represents one of the largest RWSS programs in Africa. It comes with some risks on capacity
development for such a large operation as well as adequacy of the private sector to respond to community
and district demands for goods and services. GoT has however mitigated these risks by adopting a two
staged process (i) focus on "quick wins" involving rehabilitation of existing system, new systems that do
not need elaborate technical assistance in the first two years; and (ii) to tackle complex systems that
involve technical assistance in design and construction supervision after the first two years. This strategy
will allow GoT to expand its capacity building activities country wide and also allow time to mobilize
technical assistance to support districts.

5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance


5.1      Bank Performance

5.1.1    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry. Rating: Satisfactory. The Bank recognized
the disappointing results from past investments in the water sector. The Bank started investing in the
development of the conceptual framework as far back as 1996, some six years before the appraisal of the
Project, through extensive dialogue with Government. The Bank team carried limited sector work and
studies to ascertain the operating conditions in Tanzania, had extensive discussion with numerous
stakeholders as well as drawing on experiences from similar operations in Ghana, Uganda and Kenya.
The Bank also drew lessons from its global experience from the RWSS Thematic Group based in the
Bank. Notwithstanding the extensive time and investment the Bank made in investigating the sector
issues to be addressed and the strategic choices to be made, its first inclination was to opt for a limited
"pilot" in 3 districts. However, as events shifted from a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) to medium
size Specific Investment Loan (SIL), the Bank Team insisted on a two stage approach  to start with the
first 3 districts before extension to the additional 9 districts. The Bank's early involvement and effort
ensured quality at entry and insistence on the two stage implementation approach of cautiously piloting
the implementation in 3 districts before expanding to all 12 districts significantly contributed to the
Project's Satisfactory outcome.

5.1.2    Quality of Supervision. Rating: Satisfactory. Bank supervision team was cognizant of the fact
that, close follow up and flexible adjustment was an important recipe for avoiding the failure of past
approaches to water and sanitation service delivery. Being forewarned of the risks, efforts were made to
ensure that the supervision team was composed of the right mix. The team conducted field inspections,
provided guidance where needed on the spot and made debriefings to the districts on its findings and
often suggested needed corrections. The team's supervision reports were focused on measures to be taken
to correct errors observed in the field and were made known to MoW for its follow up. After the Mid-



                                                     16

Term Review, the supervision team recommended specific adjustment and the necessary capacity
reinforcements. This follow-up action plan resulted in the satisfactory outcome reported.

5.1.3   Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance. Rating: Satisfactory. The Bank team
maintained presence and engagement with the Borrower throughout the course of project implementation.
The relocation of the Task Team Leader to the Country Office helped greatly in ensuring continuous
supervision after the Mid-term Review. The Bank team maintained pro-activity in carrying out the
corrective restructuring following the Mid-Term Review.          Bank Management provided significant
oversight and the resources to the Task team to ensure the progressive upgrade of the Project from
"Unsatisfactory" status to "Satisfactory" status before Project closure. Supervision was significant, with
full teams covering all themes and able to carry out thorough field visit and consultation with GoT
officials at all levels.

5.2     Borrower Performance

5.2.1   Government Performance. Rating: Satisfactory. The main contribution of the government to the
success of the Project design and implementation is the adoption of the new Water Sector Policy (2002),
articulated in its Letter of Policy of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation. The policy provides new
directions emphasizing:

 A demand responsive approach whereby communities choose service levels based on their perceived
    needs and abilities;
 An upfront contribution to capital costs and the full financing of O&M costs by communities as
    means to foster ownership of the project; and ,
 Implementation and management of the scheme by communities with assistance of the local
    governments and the private sector.

The commitment to these and other principles outlined in the policy such as decentralization of RWSS
services, incentives for sustainable RWSS operations, promotion of private sector participation all went a
long way to create the necessary environment for the district implementation model. Despite many short-
comings in operations such as delays in transfer of funds and delays encountered in placement of
engineers in the districts, GoT remained committed to the Water Sector Policy. The commitment to the
policy principles helped the recovery process after the Project was rated unsatisfactory. The launching of
a successor program is a further testimony that the Government is intent to harvesting the best outcome
from this operation. It is significant to note that the MoW implemented one of the largest rural WSS
projects in the East African region without a dedicated Project Implementation Unit and is now using the
lesson to initiate one of the largest RWSS program in the Africa Region. Overall compliance with
covenants and agreements towards the achievement of the project, despite some short comings, has been
supportive towards achieving the development objective. The borrower performance is therefore assessed
as satisfactory.

5.2.2   Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The
implementation agencies faced a difficult learning curve in building the required capacity for discharging
their responsibilities. Both the MoW and the districts have come a long way. They have acquired the
necessary orientation and experience in program development which is currently being used in the scale
up operation. Whilst much of the initial capacity problems have been addressed in the course of
implementation, the implementing agencies still face many challenges to ensure O&M and sustainability.
The progress made in registering satisfactory outcomes after the Mid-term Review needs to be maintained.
Strong monitoring and evaluation from districts to MoW Water Sector Development Program will help
improve the development outcome in the medium term.

5.2.3    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance. Rating: Satisfactory
Given the scale and complexity of the Project as well as initial capacity constraints, both the GoT and the
implementing agencies at district level have made progressive improvements over the project
implementation life.

6.       Lessons Learned

6.1      Demand Responsive Projects in Decentralized Environment Need Time to Demonstrate
Benefits and Space for Experimentation. By their very nature demand responsive projects rely on many
unknowns. One cannot always predict community preferences and choices which are at the heart of
ownerships and sustainability.       Coupled with operating in a decentralized environment with weak
institutions, project implementation require time for concluding extensive consultative process, working
with communities to make rational choices and sometimes mobilizing the non-existent private sector to
respond to community demands. Extensive capacity building in needed as well as the space for service
providers to experiment and scale up what works.

6.2      Community Involvement in the Design, Implementation, Operation and Maintenance is a
Key Factor to Sustainability. Community ownership that results from involvement has stopped
vandalizing water schemes. It has contributed to the innovation of the "water rate" that works. Before the
introduction of the participatory approach, where the Central government was the only agent involved in
the provision of water, vandalizing of water schemes was common. Now with the change in the incentive
system, communities are stakeholders and thus contribute to maintaining the assets for the benefit of the
community. This project underscores that sustainability is a function of incentives.

6.3      Efforts to Raise Community Contributions as means of Ensuring "Ownership" and
Commitment to Pay for Water must be Strengthened in Districts where Contribution Rates are
Low. The challenges posed by collecting contributions from very poor communities were widely
recognized. Such communities might need longer collection periods, and allowance for partial in-kind
contributions. Persistence and strong information campaigns are needed where the perception of water as
a "free good" remains strong.

6.4      Creative experimentation among beneficiaries is productive. The district implementation
model has afforded opportunity for creativity among beneficiaries. The project design has allowed
districts to experiment with different water rates. For example, Mpwapwa District has pioneered the
drafting and application of Village Water Fund By-Laws regulating the collection, keeping and use of
Village Water Fund, which if extended to other districts would be likely to raise sustainability of
established schemes further. Innovation around private operation of schemes, also from Mpwapwa
District, has the potential to be extended to other districts with higher revenue generating capacity.
Successful experiences of local private operation of larger rural schemes suggest that more widespread
use of this management model should be a "must" rather than an "option".

6.5.     Empowering District Water Engineers and District Water Sanitation Team in
Decentralized Implementation is Necessary for Smooth Project Execution: Although the DWEs and
DWSTs have authority that they could exercise, there are still signs that they shy away from playing their
designated roles in accordance with the district implementation model. This could affect project outcome
unless the power relationships between central government institutions and local government institutions
are corrected in time. For example, in places where project implementation has resulted in low quality
facilities, the contractual relationship among DWEs, consultants and contractors was sometimes blamed.
DWEs, despite being responsible for hiring consultants, and signing off on consultants payments, often
complained that contractors were unwilling to respond to their requests, and that they in turn felt
disinclined to refuse to sign off on payments. This problem might be addressed through role rehearsal of


                                                   18

their respective roles and through training in contract management and quality control, and probably may
not necessitate structural changes.

6.6     Developing the local market for the construction industry and spare parts is key to
decentralized implementation. Development of the local market is key to the efficient functioning of the
private sector and for project sustainability of district level social service delivery activities. In the
construction sector, proper packaging of construction activities could help to capture economies of scale
and progressive development of the local construction industry, create the pool of skills and good
practices. Availability of spare parts in the local market could help compress the time needed for repairs,
lead to operational efficiency and is a key element of sustainability of the schemes that involve water
pumps.

6.7     The Merging of FSP/TSP Functions should be seized as an Opportunity to achieve more
accurate Identification of Community Demand.                Having separate FSPs and TSPs who contact
communities at different time, have the tendency for creating confusion in the selection of technology/
scheme type that balances the size of community contributions, water fees, scheme management options,
and the likely quality of service. A combined FSP and TSP will help maintain focus in messages to the
community. In any case, wider involvement of DWSTs and community extension workers is needed to
ensure community engagement without diverting DWEs from their core tasks. Wider involvement of the
DWST will also help mitigate the neglect of the role of the FSP in the case where the TSP and FSP roles
are combined. Development of manuals for this purpose is suggested.

6.8     Post- Construction Support and Monitoring should be Strengthened and should include
Financial Management as well as the Technical Support. Experiences from successful projects suggest
the need for a "long-term" approach to community support, especially with regard to financial
management. To ensure high quality of book-keeping, limit attempts to embezzle village water funds, the
District Water Department must monitor revenue collection and expenditures. This type of post-
construction support should extend to advice on the viability of fee collection methods. Experience at this
point clearly suggests that flat rates are not sustainable. Technical support should span from maintenance
advice to advice on repairs when necessary. The Development of Technical Operations and Financial
Management Manuals were suggested.

                                    Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.        Component 1: Establishment of the district implementation model (estimated at US$1.20
million; ICR US$2.01 million). Overall Rating: Satisfactory. All 12 districts have established a DWST.
The three activities under this component were completed satisfactorily and contributed significantly to
the achievement of the overall objective of the project. They supported the establishment of operational
capacity of DWSTs to prepare district RWSS plans and appraise RWSS sub-projects proposed by the
communities. The component laid the foundation for achieving a workable implementation model, albeit
after some retooling. The quality of the capacity built at the local government level was assessed in the
Beneficiary Assessment Survey.

Activity 1.1: Support to the establishment and strengthening of operational capacity (equipment support
and training) of DWSTs to prepare district RWSS plans and appraise RWSS sub-projects proposed by the
communities. Rating: Satisfactory.

2.        All 12 DWST are working with: i) Facilitation Services Providers (FSPs) for community
support services and (ii) Technical Services Providers (TSPs) for design and construction supervision
services. Communities now know where and who to go to for support. Since this is a new sector
development strategy, some weaknesses exist in the areas of planning and in particular contract
administration. DWSTs have to enhance their capabilities to be able to provide high quality post-
construction management, monitoring and reporting. There may also be a need to combine FSPs and
TSPs to be more effective.

Activity 1.2: Support for the establishment of district RWSS Funds (a sector conditional grant system) to
finance the construction of new RWSS schemes, the rehabilitation and expansion of existing systems and
possibly other water related small scale infrastructure investment. Rating: Satisfactory.

3.        All the 12 districts have established a RWSS Fund and have been receiving funds for each of
the year's programs. However, transfer of funds has been occasionally delayed. The DWSF Account
allowed for transfers of resources from the Project Special Account for payments at the district level for
goods, civil works and services. All consultancy services, sub-project costs and incremental operating
expenses were met by the district through the account. The result of these transfers and the ensuing audits
of these accounts provided lessons and the framework for the design of the fiscal transfers of water grants
under the Local Government Capital Development Grants system as well as the WSDP. Community
contributions to the investment programs have continued to increase but not at the desired levels.
Information provided by the MoW shows that overall, community contributions amounted to 65% of the
total amount expected under the project for all the 12 districts. The contributions range from 19% in
Manyoni to 100% in the First Year Investment Program (FYIP) in the first 3 districts. The average
contribution, excluding the 3 poor performing districts is about 74%. The level of contributions under the
Second Year Investment Program (SYIP) in the first 3 districts is about 71%.

Activity 1.3: Assistance to communities in the proper management and operation of these systems
through appropriate hygiene education as well as promoting HIV/AIDS mitigation and prevention
activities. Rating: Satisfactory.

4.       Sanitation and hygiene activities as well as HIV mitigation were initially incorporated in the work
of the FSPs as part of mobilization of communities leading to the preparation of Facilities Management
Plans (FMPs). However, the emerging FMPs and associated sub-projects did not provide adequate
attention to sanitation activities. A deliberate effort has been made by MoW since the Mid-Term Review
to address this subject, resulting in a satisfactory overall outcome.
     School Hygiene and Sanitation: construction of demonstration latrines and hand washing
         facilities; formulation and training for school and community health and sanitation clubs as part
         of hygiene and sanitation education. Implementation includes:
         a)       School hygiene and sanitation activities
                   i)      introduction of child-to-child approaches
                   ii)     formation of school sanitation clubs

                   iii)  training in needs assessment and training on the child-to-child approach
                   iv)   organizing competitions between sanitation clubs on improved hygiene and
                         sanitation behavior
                   v)    construction of demonstration latrines and hand washing facilities
         b)       Community hygiene and sanitation facilities
                   i)    raising awareness for better hygiene and sanitation behaviors
                   ii)   formation of community sanitation clubs
                   iii)  training in needs assessment, and training of artisans as well as formation of
                         sanitation clubs
                   iv)   construction of demonstration latrines at centers

     Household Sanitation Marketing: extensive training of fundis (artisans) in manufacturing and
         installation of hygienic sanitation slabs (SanPlats). Project districts have already benefited from
         the trained fundis namely; Handeni, Igunga, Kilindi, Kondoa, Kongwa, Morogoro Rural,
         Mpwapwa, Mvomero.         Furthermore, the MoW donated the training activities to the GoT's
         observation of World Toilet Day. This was held in Ifunda, Iringa Rural (outside the project area)
         on Nov. 19, 2007. During the training, the activities included:
         a)       Development of training package (training manuals, posters, and leaflets)
         b)       Training of over 540 fundis from all 12 districts
         c)       Production of over 3,000 SanPlats, over 1,200 installed (43%)
         d)       Improved capacity of artisans
         e)       30 SanPlat production centers formed

5.       Since October 2007, the MoW has been transferring funds earmarked for sanitation to districts.
Additionally, the MoW has allocated two staff members to community sanitation and hygiene. However,
more support and work needs to be put into developing district-level sanitation and hygiene plans. There
is also the need to integrate sanitation and hygiene into national planning and budgeting.

6.         Component 2: Construction of RWSS community sub-projects (estimated at US$21.30
million; ICR: US$ 21.78 million). Overall Rating: Satisfactory This component had four activities:

Activity 2.1: Community sub-project. Rating: Satisfactory. By the project closing date, the demand-
based district implementation model was validated and made operational in all 12 districts.

7.         Water supply improved in 121 communities within the 12 project districts serving a total
population of 521,629 people as compared to the initial target of 133 communities and 500,000 people
(revised mid-term target);
     A total of 140 boreholes, of which 117 were successfully fitted with motorized pumps;
     154 shallow wells, of which 141 were successfully fitted with hand pumps.
     187 storage tanks against planned target of 213 storage tanks;
     734 km pipes laid against a planned target of 816 km; and
     72 cattle trough constructed against a planned target of 74 cattle troughs.
    The achievement of this component resulted in significant time saving for women and children who
    often spent long hours fetching water. This boosted school attendance and performance amongst the
    pupils.

Activity 2.2: Supply Chain-Hand Pump and Spare Parts Supply. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

8.       In October 2004, the Ministry signed 3 year contracts with two contractors (WEDECO and
Harness Africa) for:
     Supply and stocking of hand pumps for shallow depth, medium depth and deep boreholes;
     Establishment of district outlets for continuous stocking of spare parts;
     Appointment of certified technicians for each district outlet for the construction of hand pump
         platforms and installation of hand pumps, training of village handpump caretakers, provision of
         repair services and periodic inspections; and,


                                                      24

     Construction of platforms, transportation and installation of handpumps and training of at least
        three village hand pump caretakers

9.      The supply chain was designed to cover 3 Business Units:
     Business Unit 1 (covering Morogoro); central zonal depots have been established in Morogoro
        Municipality while district outlets have been established and agents identified in Kilosa,
        Morogoro (R), Handeni and Rufiji. Certified technicians have also been identified for each of the
        districts and 4 pump caretakers trained for water point management.
     Business Unit 2 (covering Dodoma); a central zonal depot has been established in Dodoma
        Municipality while district outlets have been established in Mpwapwa, Kongwa, Kiteto and
        Kondoa through identification of spare parts sales agents. Certified technicians have also been
        appointed and trained for each of the districts.
     Business Unit 3 (covering Singida); central zonal depot has been established in Singida while
        district outlets have been established in Igunga, Iramba, Manyoni and Singida. Certified
        technicians have also been appointed and trained for each of the districts.

10.     Visits to the districts and villages showed some progress but the supply chain did not seem to be
working optimally. Communities in some districts have received training and demonstrated adequate
capacity for repairs. They also know where to go for more specialized support and purchase of spare
parts. The progress report submitted by the MoW showed that there are a number of handpumps that have
been supplied under the supply chain contract and were available for installation in communities with
non-functioning hand pumps in the project districts.

Activity 2.3: Supervision, Design and Construction Supervision. Rating: Satisfactory

11.     Support in implementing community sub-projects was received from Facilitation Services
Providers (FSPs) made up of district and regional NGOs, and Technical Services Providers (TSPs)
comprising of national technical consultants. All beneficiary communities and sub-projects benefited
from about 12 months of FSP support and extensive support from the TSPs. The FSPs took the
communities through the initial health implications of water and sanitation provision to stimulate demand
for improved services, support communities through the project cycle and assist communities prepare
their Facilities and Management Plans (FMP). The FMPs became the focus of the sub-project design and
implementation by the TSPs. Discussions with district leaders and communities during field visits
confirmed that due to the delays in completion of sub-projects, particularly in the extended 9 districts,
DWSTs could not institute adequate arrangements and structures for post-construction management in a
number of communities. The delays encountered missed the opportunity to lay the foundation for post-
construction O&M and management during the construction phase which is the most appropriate time.
The situation was far better in the first 3 districts. Nevertheless, the results of the Beneficiary Assessment
survey demonstrates that the situation is improving in many communities but there is the need for follow-
up on the post-construction maintenance management.

12.     In response to the demand-based approach of project design, communities had experimented with
post-construction management with positive results in three areas. The Mpwapwa district innovation is
exemplary. Their experimentation should be nurtured and emerging lessons and experiences should be
widely disseminated to other districts and communities. The three areas are:

     Instituting charges for all the completed systems using different systems for charging. The most
        successful ones are those charging for water based on consumption using 20 litre containers (Jeri
        cans or buckets) with typical price levels of TSh10 or 20 and even 50 in a few villages. A number
        of villages have been charging a flat amount per household (TSh 500 in the case of Hembeti in

        Morogoro Rural district) and in one case, TSh300 per person per month (in Chanzuru in
        Mpwapwa). Experience to date has shown that flat rate charges have been difficult to administer
        and revenue collection has been poor in all cases. Some of the communities (in Mpwapwa and
        Kilosa) have introduced best practice in water fund management by preparing and submitting
        quarterly reports on revenues and expenses to the districts.
     Financial transparency. It is recommended that under the WSDP, DWSTs should provide
        communities with improved templates for financial reporting and in particular, to analyze and use
        the information submitted for purposes of assisting them to improve management.
     Private operators. This is in the form of using professional local private operators. This should
        be encouraged and lessons replicated in other districts.

Activity 2.4: Support to Innovation window program. Rating: Satisfactory

13.     In November 2005, the MoW signed contracts with 10 consultants/service providers to
implement 10 sub-projects under the Innovation Window (IW), which are collectively considered to be
the applied research and development component of the Project. Progress to completion was reported to
be 98%. The sub-projects focused on:
     sanitation and health;
     information and communication technology;
     management of water supply; and
     productive use of water.

14.     Although the selected offers were apparently the best at the time of selection, some of the sub-
projects lack innovativeness. Furthermore, ownership and information dissemination of the results of any
innovations as originally planned, needs to be accordingly addressed by MoW upon completion of the
sub-projects.

National RWSS Program. Rating: Satisfactory.

16.     The Technical Advisory Committee comprising multi-sector and multi-disciplinary stakeholders
had been active during the life of the project. The Project was formally launched with a stakeholder
workshop on October 15, 2002 in Dar es Salaam. About 10 TAC meetings were conducted during the life
of the Project. The TAC meetings stopped after the Water Sector Working Group (WSWG) and the
Thematic Groups of the WSDP were established within the sector dialogue mechanism.

Activity 3.2: Technical Assistance- Preparation of the National RWSS Program. Rating: Satisfactory

17.     The Project Management Support (PMS) consultants, mobilized in May 2003, assisted GoT to:
     carry out a demand assessment for the National RWSS Program,
     prepare a technical report establishing the capital and O&M costs and investment forecasts;
     prepare a training and capacity building strategy which is the basis for the ongoing CAPSTART,

      review and update implementation tools such as the Project Operational Manual (POM) and the
         District Operational Manual (DOM); and
      prepare the initial design of the MIS for the implementation of the National RWSS Program. An
         addendum was effected on the PMS contract to support MoW in the finalization of Urban WSS
         and WRM component of the Water Sector Support Program and to prepare the harmonized
         document for WSDP.

Activity 3.3: Development of a MIS for tracking lessons learned from the proposed Project. Rating:
Satisfactory

18.     About 50 different training and capacity building events were organized under the Project. Some
were stand alone events and others integrated into the activities of the FSP (for communities), TSP (for
DWST) and specific events under the PMS contract. Manuals and training materials on all aspects and all
levels of project implementation were developed. Numerous study reports and relevant documents for the
preparation of the National RWSS Program were also prepared under this Project. The training
programs/workshops conducted under the RWSSP focused on capacity building of MoW staff, district
staff, DWSTs, communities, local artisans, and in some cases private sector and NGOs. Start up
orientation/training (CAPSTART) was carried out for all DWST in all districts in the country ahead of the
National RWSS Program. Activities were also initiated to support selected private sector firms and
companies in the form of support grants for leasing of equipment.

Activity 3.4: Assistance to the restructuring of RWSS sector institutions within MoW and the building of
the capacity of key stakeholders (MoW, NGOs, consultants, contractors, suppliers of equipment and
service providers). Rating: Satisfactory

19.     All provision of goods, civil works and services were provided to the Project by private sector
providers. To date the Project has promoted the use of:
      53 local small works contractors;
      13 drilling companies;
      10 mechanized pump suppliers and maintenance agents;
      2 Handpumps suppliers and maintenance agents;
      4 consulting firms (TSPs);
      540 sanitation artisans; and
      Large number of NGOs and Facilitation Services Providers (FSPs).

20.     The Project provided training for some of the FSPs to improve their outreach approaches. Some
firms also obtained support grants through a leasing arrangement under the project to procure needed well
sitting equipment and other construction accessories. The biggest contribution is the opportunity to bid
competitively for provision of services at the district level.

Activity 3.5: Assistance to MoW for overall management of the Project. Rating: Satisfactory

21.     Project Coordination Unit at MoW was dissolved and Project management streamlined/integrated
into the activities of the restructured Rural Water Supply Division of the Ministry of Water. This activity
is completely merged into the implementation of the National RWSS Program.

                               Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

3.1 Objective

The benefit of the Project would be (a) the improvement of the WSS service to about 550,000 people,
living in 121 rural and small towns of less than 15, 000 in the 12 project districts; and (b) the development
of an enabling environment for launching a RWSS Program nation wide. Women and children living in
rural communities that spend long hours fetching water of doubtful quality would be the primary
beneficiaries of the Project. The objective of this post-construction economic evaluation is to demonstrate
if the implementation model put into operation has facilitated the realization of the expected economic
benefits.

3.2 Benefits and Cost Evaluation

3.2.1 Approach

The pre-investment cost-benefit analyses were made under the following set of assumptions: the
increased quantity of water supplied under a sub-project can be divided into two parts: one part replaces
the previous sources and quantity of water used, and the other part is net increase in water consumption.
In this context, benefit of the first part is equal to the savings of economic costs of consumers who no
longer use the former water sources. Benefit of the second part is equal to the area below the demand
curve between the with-project and without-project of each consumer.

In the post-construction evaluation, the same assumptions used in pre-investment, i.e. current water use
equivalent from all sources is replaced by water use from improved sources provided under the sub-
project. Although water production for the current population has exceeded 10 litres per capita per day,
the potential additional consumption has not been valued separately as was the case at appraisal. This
would lead to underestimation of the benefit from the provision of the improved sources. The project is
expected to help generate health benefits by reducing incidence of diarrhoea and dysentery. However, the
expected health benefits have also not been included in the post-investment estimates as was the case in
the pre-investment analysis.

Some of the benefits resulted from replacing expensive vending water with cheaper water from the sub-
project. Again, since the majority of the benefits accrue from reduction in the time spent in collecting
water from sources such as streams, rivers and wells, this is also not factored in the estimate. The time
saved is valued at 30% of the unskilled minimum wage to allow for differences between the minimum
wage and unofficial rates prevalent. It is also assumed, as was the case of pre-investment that, only 70
percent of the time saved can actually be spent in the commercially productive uses. Thus, part of the time
savings are valued in money terms.

3.2.2 Summary of benefits and costs

The analysis was based on the field data collected during project implementation in all the project districts.
The analyses undertaken suggest that the benefits from the savings are large and sufficient to validate the
investment made to improve water supply. Specifically, Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and
Net Present Value (NPV) calculated for the three technological options are as follows.

3.2.3    Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis was carried out for the following scenarios: a) 10% increase in the investment cost;
(b) 20% decrease in the time savings. The analysis shows that the options undertaken are all viable,
providing rates of return range from 49% to 16% for the base case. In the sensitivity analyses, the
shallow wells rate of return is marginally below the 12% discount rate, if the time savings are reduced by
20%, while the result is positive for the other scenarios.

3.2.4    Validation of the community evaluation model.

To ensure equity, the following rules were instituted by MoW to control excessive community demand:
(a) a capital cost cap equivalent to US$40 per capita for all sub-project; (b) a community contribution of
at least 5%; and district contribution of 5% of the capital cost of the sub-project; and (c) full financing of
O&M by the community. In retrospect and on the aggregate, these guidelines proved to be valid, although
there were significant variations in investment costs per technological option and across project districts.

3.3.     Cost -effectiveness analysis

A set of cost-effectiveness indicators is shown in Table 3.2 for the three technological options: for deep
well pumping scheme, gravity scheme and handpump scheme. The investment per person served and the
investment per metric cube of water produced shows significant variation between districts and between
the technological options considered. For example, Handeni district has nearly six times the average cost
for bore holes. Deep wells have both the highest investment per person served and highest investment
cost per cubic water produced. More people get their water supply everyday via deep wells than the other
two options.

3.4      Qualitative assessments of the benefits of the rural water supply

On May 27, 2004, a meeting was called to assess the beneficiaries' views of a water supply project in
Sazima, a village in Mpwapwa district. Sazima village is about one-and a half-hour travel on a rough
road from the district capital. Previously, villagers used to draw water from a private well 10km from the
village (average round trip of 6 hours). Now they have access to an improved water system within the
village. Their lively account as captured from their narration below bears testimony to the positive
outcomes of the water project.

              Annex 5. Beneficiary Assessment/Service Delivery Survey Summary Report

1.       Introduction

The objective of this study was to review the quality of services delivered by RWSSP sub-projects.
Given the importance attributed to community demand and participation in sub-project identification and
implementation on quality of service eventually delivered, the survey examined the sub-projects from the
beginning of the project cycle. Much emphasis in project design has been on strengthening District Water
Departments and their supporting role in the development of community water schemes. The survey
therefore analyzed the relationship between communities and District Water Departments in order to
assess the extent to which either one supports successful establishment of sustainable and high quality
water services.

The methodology used for this study was a mix of quantitative and qualitative survey instruments. In each
district detailed questionnaires were administered to districts to assess the capacity in the District Water
Departments for planning, budgeting and implementation of water and sanitation projects, as well as for
providing support to village operations and maintenance activities. Four study sites were selected in each
district - with the exception of Mpwapwa District where two additional sites were visited to gain insights
from experiences with private operation of community schemes. The total sample size was 26 study sites.
The sites were randomly selected, but the survey team was instructed to replace uncompleted schemes
with completed ones  if necessary and possible.

At each site, a review of the financial, technical and institutional arrangements was undertaken through
semi-structured key informant interviews with facility management. Key informants included members of
Village Water Committees (VWCs), the pump attendant or another person with supervisory and technical
responsibilities. Where relevant, private operators were interviewed using semi-structured interviews (1
questionnaire/data collection template was administered to a group of key informants). Focus group
discussions with community members were conducted to assess the quality of service provided and
benefits achieved. These were conducted separately for men and women.

2.       Built Capacity
Interviewed VWCs and Personnel at the District Water Department all acknowledged tangible increases
in district capacity as a consequence of the RWSSP. In comparison with the situation before the RWSSP,
the presence of Water Engineers in all districts represents an important change. In addition, a large
number of other Technical Staff have joined the District Water Departments. Many interviewed DWEs
reported being in touch with VWCs over mobile phone when problems occur, which was confirmed in
community interviews. However, a few schemes remain outside the mobile network and some DWEs
further pointed out the challenges associated with ongoing monitoring of schemes spanning large
distances accessible only via low quality roads.

All sampled districts now have assigned DWEs, but in one case, the District Water Engineer is still
undertaking part time study in Dar es Salaam to obtain a Master's Degree. In another case, the Engineer
was posted to the district in the middle of project implementation thus compromising quality control
during the early phase of implementation.

3.       Project Implementation

3.1      Delays in project implementation. Project implementation time increased over time as the Project
moved from the 3 pilot districts to all 12 districts. Time delays were attributed to an overly long and
drawn out procurement process. Complaints were also made about the lack of surveying skills in some
districts (difficulty in identifying ground water sources), and the difficulty of collecting community
contributions. Some mentioned the unfortunate effects of having to start civil works before a source had
been identified.

3.2      Community Contributions. As a pre-requisite for sub-project construction, communities were
required to pay 5 percent of investment costs. This requirement was instituted as a mechanism to assess
community demand for water, their ability and willingness to pay for water and by extension the future
sustainability of schemes. Two out of the sampled six districts have been successful in meeting this
requirement, collecting close to 100% of required contributions. The reason most frequently given for
falling short of this in other districts was been a high level of poverty in sub-project communities.
However, when comparing the ratio of required and actual payments within districts no pattern emerges
between the absolute size of required contributions and communities' ability to meet them. Large
variation in average collection rates between districts furthermore suggest that the strategies applied and
perseverance of DWEs in managing community contributions played at least a partial role in explaining
differences across districts. In one district that had been particularly successful in ensuring community
contributions, the DWE suggested that poorer communities need more flexible conditions and longer
collection times. In addition, DWSTs must visit relatively deprived communities more frequently and
take seasonal hardships such as drought into consideration when setting up collection schedule.

               Note: Data includes contributions for all schemes regardless of whether they are completed
               or not.

3.3     Facilitation Service Providers. Communities generally complain that the presence of Facilitation
Service Providers (FSPs) was too brief (less than one day) to be effective in convincing people to
contribute. Incidences of embezzlement of collected community contributions by community leaders were
reported in many communities. This eroded contributions and morale in such communities.

3.4     The Relationship between DWEs, Contractors and Communities. In places where project
implementation has resulted in low quality facilities, the contractual relationship among DWEs,
consultants, and contractors was sometimes blamed. As discussed above, DWEs often complained that
contractors were unwilling to respond to their requests, and that they were not able to refuse to sign off on
payment. This problem might be solved through training in contract management and quality control, and
probably does not necessitate structural changes. When asked, VWCs seemed uninterested in assuming
responsibility for procurement - an option the project design opened up for. However, in places where
construction activities resulted in low quality facilities, lack of community involvement led to strong
feelings of disempowerment, thus eroding any sense of ownership previously established. It might
therefore be advisable that communities' supervisory role is strengthened. In addition, this might lower
the workload placed on District Water Departments if direct reporting mechanisms are established.

4.      Sustainability

4.1     Technical Sustainability. Both interviewed DWEs and VWCs attested that the responsiveness of
DWEs was quite high when confronted with technical problems. In a number of districts
(Morogoro/Mvomero, Mpwapwa and Kilosa), problems were solved within a couple of weeks or less.
Village technicians and DWSTs are acknowledged as solving problems in these districts swiftly when
they occur. When pumping equipment like valves and water points failed, the problems sometimes take
longer to rectify. Three (Macadam in Kilos, Jabirus Makati in Radii, and Mamba in Morongo  all piped
schemes) of the surveyed 22 completed schemes had no functional water points at the time of the survey.
This was attributed to insufficient water sources or low pumping capacity thus reflecting problems in
project implementation rather than post-construction management. The share of non-functional water

points was high for shallow wells in Radii District. Interviewees in two schemes complained of repeated
breakdowns, and that they felt disinclined to keep paying for repairs.

 The sample consisted of 19 functioning schemes. The 4 schemes in Manyoni were excluded as they were unfinished.
 Finished, but schemes with no functional distribution points include: Jaribu Mpakani (Rufiji); Makalama (Kilosa), and
 Mtamba (Morogoro). Inadequate water sources are blamed in all  in addition, poor quality pump is blamed in Jaribu
 Mpakani.

4.2       Financial Sustainability

In two districts, all surveyed facilities were operating flat rate payment schemes (Kilosa and Mvomero/
Morogoro). Few seem to be following sustainable book-keeping practices. Only 40 % of schemes were in
possession of revenue and expenditure data. Comparing operating costs across the sampled schemes,
only 29% flat rate schemes are covering operating costs. Shallow wells in general ("flat rate" and "pay-
as-you-fetch" schemes) appear to be struggling to cover operating costs  only 14% of the surveyed
schemes manage to cover cost. However, piped schemes with "pay-as-you-fetch payment structures 
regardless of whether they are based on diesel, electricity pumps or gravity systems  generally are able to
cover operating costs (78% of sampled schemes). Only two schemes in the entire sample were judged
capable of covering full maintenance costs (both under private operation).

Problems associated with poor financial management and embezzlement of funds were reported as
prevalent in all districts where revenue is being collected, and frustration over such incidences seems to
be an important cause of low revenue collection.

         BOX 1: By-Laws Guiding Financial Management of Schemes from Mpwapwa District

Irrespective of whether a scheme is managed by a Village Water Committee or a Private Operator, Distribution
Point Attendants and the Treasury must make and note meter readings, and verify the amount of money collected. In
schemes operated by Village Water Committees, it is the Treasurer who is responsible for banking revenues. In
schemes operated by private contractors this is done by the contractor, according to the terms and conditions
stipulated in their contract.

Contracts entered by private contractors also stipulate that contractors must provide monthly reports to the Village
Water Committee which submits these to Village Governments. Village Governments disclose reports at Village
Meetings. Village Water Committees are similarly obliged to hold monthly meetings.

In cases where misappropriation of funds have taken place, the District Water Engineer has the power to take the
case to the District Council to be deliberated on by Councilors before it is decided upon whether legal action should
be taken.

Before being allowed to withdraw money from their bank account, the Village Water Committee are obliged to hold
a meeting and prepare minutes which are sent to the District Water Engineer for approval. Bank transaction copies
as well as procurement receipts must be sent to the District Water Engineer's office and a copy filed. Funds are ring-
fenced. District Water Engineer can reject expenses that are unrelated to the scheme in question.

 The sample consisted of 19 functioning schemes. Finished, but schemes with no functional distribution points include: Jabirus
 Makati (Radii); Macadam (Kilos), and Mamba (Morongo).There were 7 flat-rate schemes and 13 "pay-as-you-fetch schemes".
 The survey contained 6 shallow wells, 5 gravity schemes and 9 deep wells.

In Mpwapwa District the introduction of by-laws regulating the collection, keeping and use of Village
Water Funds suggests that problems of financial mismanagement can be curbed through district
monitoring efforts. Comparison of privately operated and VWC schemes in Mpwapwa District suggest
that the former is able to generate higher revenues, and thus be more sustainable in the longer run.
However, given the low capacity of the private sector in many districts, the initiation of such
arrangements are likely to require substantial support from districts to set-up.

 Private operator's fee is calculated as a 39% share of revenue minus diesel/electricity costs. Maintenance costs are calculated
 by assuming 2-5% original investment costs annually should be set aside for maintenance. The survey team asked about
 revenues during rainy and dry seasons. When calculating average monthly revenues 2 dry seasons were assumed.

5.       Perceived Benefits and Quality of Services

Significant impact on rural livelihood is evident from functional and well-managed schemes. When asked
to prioritize the main benefits from the RWSSP, time saving and productivity increases are mentioned in
12 out of 17 communities. Time saving in hours-per-day varied from 1 and 4 hours. Interviews in some
villages interestingly suggested that the availability of piped water had stimulated demand and
construction of brick houses, eventually leading to a demand for private connections. It is noticeable that
constructed schemes cover large populations. It is also noticeable that a large number of schemes are
perceived as delivering high quality services in terms of taste, smell and color.

6.       Conclusion

Survey results suggest substantial benefits from successful sub-projects. A large number of sample and
actual sub-projects cover large populations from targeted villages and sub-villages. The quality of service
is generally considered of high quality by communities.

The collection of community contributions varies substantially between districts  irrespective of the
absolute size of required contributions, thus suggesting scope for extending best practice strategies from
the most to the least effective districts.

Survey results suggest that capacity has been built in District Water Departments as well as in some
communities. DWSTs and communities in general are able to solve technical problems as they occur.
Average repair time varies from district to district, but smaller problems are generally solved within a
couple of weeks. Broken pumping equipment, and sometimes pipes and valves often take a little longer.
Three of the surveyed schemes had no functional distribution points. In all cases, problems reflected flaws
in project implementation rather than post-construction maintenance and repair. To increase the quality of
works, it might be beneficial to strengthen district capacity in contract management and quality control.
The share of non-functional water points was high for shallow wells in Rufiji District, where problems of
ground water salinity are common. Interviewees in two schemes plagued by repeated breakdowns and
low quality of services confessed that the community was now unwilling to pay for water as well as
repairs. It is possible that stronger assessment of community demand should have led to investment in
deep wells under such difficult groundwater conditions, or perhaps not being pursued if communities
preferred resorting to traditional sources of water if challenged by higher water fees.

In districts where large piped schemes operating "pay-as you fetch" payment structures are prevalent, all
schemes seem able to cover operating costs. Financial sustainability is low in flat rate schemes and
shallow well facilities  a payment system that would be advisable to abandon. Embezzlement of Village
Water Funds is a widespread problem for collection of initial community contributions, as well as for
revenue collected from the water sales. The prevalence of these problems, and the negative impact they
have on the sustainability of schemes, suggest that the DWSTs have an important role to play as a check
on community leadership to raise financial sustainability. Mpwapwa District has pioneered the drafting
and application of Village Water Fund By-Laws regulating the collection, keeping and use of Village
Water Fund, which if extended to other districts would be likely to raise sustainability of established
schemes further. Innovation around private operation of schemes also from Mpwapwa District should
also be extended to other districts as experiences show higher revenue generating capacity in these
schemes.

                           "What was learned from RWSSP implementation?"

                                          Stakeholder Workshop
                                       29th of May 2008, Morogoro

1.      The Ministry of Water organized a workshop on "The Accomplishments, Challenges Faced
and Lessons Learned from the Implementation of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project" in
connection with the World Bank's Final Supervision Mission from May 19 to June 4, 2008 and in
preparation for project closure on the 30th of June 2008.

2.      The event brought together approximately 75 participants from the Project districts; Water
Technical Advisers from the 5 Regional Secretariats; the Ministry of Water; and the World Bank
Supervision Mission.      Districts were represented by District Water Engineers (DWEs), District
Executive Directors, District Planning Officers and District Health Officers. The Workshop was
opened by Assistant Director for Community Water and Sanitation, Eng. Mziray, on behalf of the
Director, Eng. Mukumwa.

3.      The first part of the workshop had two different objectives: First, to map out action points for
the completion of outstanding project activities before RWSSP closure. Secondly, to discuss and
summarize main achievements, challenges faced, and lessons learned within the context of the
ongoing implementation of the Water and Sanitation Development Program (WSDP). The workshop
adopted the following Actions Points for Successful RWSSP Closure:


     Completion of as many Sub-Project Activities as possible before June 21st
     Compilation of Outstanding Payments;
     Preparation of Action Plan for Spill-Over Activities/Sub-Projects to be completed under the
        Water Supply Development Program by beginning FY08/09
     Submission of Final District Completion Report;
     Operationalization of MIS (Village Folder System) in all Districts;
     Installation of constructed sunguru slabs (SanPlat);
     Preparation of Strategy for Post 쵣onstruction Management of Schemes.

4.      Discussions on RWSSP's main achievements and the largest challenges faced were portrayed by
detailed presentations by DWEs. The establishment of a Decentralized Project Implementation Model,
including the successful redefinition of the relationship between the MoW, Local Government Authorities
(LGAs) and communities was identified as one of the main achievements. Capacity building in Districts
through the posting of Water Engineers and the establishment of District Water and Sanitation Teams
(DWSTs) was identified as another main achievement. Community participation was emphasized as an
important element in project implementation, as this has led to greater ownership of water facilities. Last,
but not least, participants emphasized the visibly large impact successful sub-projects are having on Rural
Livelihoods in terms of lower water collection time and improved health.

5.      Deliberations on the main challenges faced in project implementation centered on supervision and
procurement issues. The relationship between District Water Departments, Service Providers (FSPs and
TSPs), and Communities was the subject of much discussion. Many argued that the District Water



                                                     41

Department must adopt a more proactive role in supervising and providing quality control of Consultants
and Contractors in the future.      The need to structure contracts so that civil works never precede
completion of drilling was also emphasized. Dissatisfaction with delays caused by the process of
obtaining "No Objections" from the World Bank, leading to cost-escalation was expressed by many. The
process of obtaining approvals of contract variations similarly was also singled out as an unfortunate
cause of delays.

6.      The second part of the workshop covered findings from a Service Delivery Survey,
commissioned by the Water and Sanitation Program-Africa, and implemented in six districts during
March and April 2008. The Survey provided insights from communities about their role in project
identification and implementation; the quality of services received; as well as an assessment of the
financial and technical sustainability of established water schemes. Information was obtained through
interviews with personnel at District Water Departments, Facility Management and Community Members.
The findings were discussed in working groups.

7.      Summarizing deliberations from the first and second parts of the workshop the following
recommendations were reached:


     Efforts to Raise Community Contributions as means of Ensuring "Ownership" and
        Commitment to Pay for Water must be strengthened in Districts where Contribution Rates
        are Low. The challenges posed by collecting contributions from very poor communities were
        widely recognized. Such communities might need longer collection periods, and allowance
        for partial in-kind contributions. Persistence and strong information campaigns are needed
        where the perception of water as a "free good" remains strong.

     The Merging of FSP/TSP Functions should be seized as an Opportunity to achieve more
        accurate Identification of Community Demand, that is, selection of technology/ scheme type
        that balances the size of community contributions, water fees, scheme management options,
        and the likely quality of service. Wider involvement of DWSTs and community extension
        workers should be, at this point in time, to facilitate stronger community engagement without
        diverting DWEs from their core tasks. Wider involvement of DWST will also serve as check
        that the merging of functions doesn't lead to a neglect of the FSP role. Development of
        manuals for this purpose was suggested.

     During the Construction phase, District Water Engineers must play a Proactive Role in
        Quality Control and Refrain from "Assuming that the Consultant is Always Right".
        Training in technical design and contract management should be provided to districts where
        the capacity for these functions is low. It was suggested that Districts are enabled to pay
        consultants on a performance basis.

     Post- Construction Support and Monitoring should be Strengthened and include Financial
        Management as well as the Technical Support. Experiences from successful projects
        suggest the need for a "long-term" approach to community support, especially with regards to
        financial management.       To ensure high quality of book-keeping and limit attempts to
        embezzle village water funds, the District Water Department must monitor revenue collection
        and expenditures. This type of post-construction support should extend to advice on the
        viability of fee collection methods. Experience at this point clearly suggests that flat rates are
        not sustainable. Technical support should span from maintenance advice to advice on repairs
        when necessary. The Development of Technical Operations and Financial Management
        Manuals were suggested.

 Good Experiences in Mpwapwa District in regulating the use of Village Water Funds
  through "Water Fund By-Laws" should be replicated as a means of controlling abuse.
  The key elements include requirements of regular deposits of revenues, granting the DWE
  authority over Village Fund withdrawals, as well as regular village meetings and disclosure
  of accounts. Detailing legal recourse in case of abuse may also be important.

 Successful Experiences of Private Operation of Larger Schemes suggest that more
  widespread use of this Management Model should be a "must" rather than an "option".
 However, low private sector capacity in many places means that a gradual approach is likely
 to be necessary and should entail substantial supervision and support when the private
 operators are engaged.

                Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

                    Final Evaluation Report of Rural Water and Sanitation Project

1.1 Introduction

In 2002 the GoT received a credit of USD 26.0 million from the International Development Association
(IDA towards the cost of implementation of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (RWSSP).
Implementation of the project started in 3 districts of Rufiji, Kilosa, and Mpwapwa as pilot districts.

The experience gained in the implementation of the project led to an expansion of districts from 3 to 12 in
2003 (later in 2004 became 14 as a result of split of 2 districts). The increased 9 districts are Morogoro
Rural/Mvomero, Handeni / Kilindi, Kiteto, Kondoa, Igunga, Singida Rural, Manyoni, Kongwa, and
Iramba. In the year 2003, while the 9 districts were implementing the project on the first year, the initial 3
districts which were on pilot were implementing the second year investment programme.

The project became effective on June 2002 and was formally launched on October 2002 in Dar es Salaam.
The project has therefore been under implementation for about six years.

Assessment of Development Objective, Design, Implementation and operational experience

2.1 Assessment of Project Objectives

2.1.1    The development objective of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project is to ensure access
to improved and sustained water and sanitation services in rural communities in Tanzania.

2.1.2    The project objective is clear and practical. It is in line with the National Water Policy
(NAWAPO) and the rural water supply objective which involves (i) to provide adequate, affordable water
supply services to the rural population, (ii) to define roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders, (iii)
to emphasize on communities paying for part of the capital costs, and full cost recovery for operation and
maintenance of services as opposed to the previous concept of cost sharing, (iv) to depart from the
traditional supply-driven to demand-responsive approach in service provision, (v) to manage water
supplies at the lowest appropriate level as opposed to the centralized command control approach, (iv) to
promote participation of the private sector in the delivery of goods and services, (vii) to improve health
through integration of water supply, sanitation and hygiene education. The development objective is also
accomplished with the preparation of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program.

2.1.3    The RWSSP, by providing reliable access to safe water and sanitation services in the 12 districts,
has reduced time used by the communities to fetch water from long distance and give them enough time
to concentrate in productive activities, thus contributing to economic growth. Also the sanitation and
hygiene promotion has improved the health of the communities and saved money and time used to treat
water-borne diseases. The prime beneficiaries of the project are women and children who typically spend
long hours to fetch water of doubtful quality. The RWSSP has improved the school attendance for
children tremendously and the women are able to utilize the time wasted in fetching water in other
activities to improve their economical status. This is evidenced in the remarkable impact the project has
had on the economic development and poverty alleviation in the 12 project districts.

2.1.4    For the period of implementation, there was no revision of the project objective set in the PAD.
However, due to some delays in project implementation the closing date of the project was extended
twice; the first extension was from June 30, 2006 to December 31, 2007 and the second one was from
December 31, 2007 to June 30, 2008. Also, in 2006 the name of the Borrower implementing agency was


                                                      44

changed from Ministry of Water and Livestock Development (MoWLD) to Ministry of Water (MoW) and
in 2008 to Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MoWI).

2.2     Assessment of Project Design

2.2.1   Overall, the implementation arrangement put in place was satisfactory. The design of the project
was correctly based on the Government's desire to fulfill its development objectives and policies directed
towards economic growth and poverty reduction by increasing the rural water supply and sanitation
services coverage to 12 project districts

2.2.2   The project design was also in line with the IDA objectives of reducing poverty and improving
the health condition of vulnerable groups in rural settlements.

2.2.3   Also the project design fulfilled the government decentralization policy under local government
reform by building the capacity at the district level and community level for planning, implementing and
managing RWSS schemes and enhancing NGOs and the private sector participation in the water projects.

2.3     Assessment of Project Implementation

2.3.1   Under the RWSSP, involvement of the communities (with the assistance of the Facilitation
Service Providers - FSPs) in decision making on water source options that correspond to their preference
and willingness to pay and formulate sub project proposals and management plans, was highly taken into
consideration during implementation.

2.3.2   The communities prepared water supply sub-projects, submitted them to local government
authorities, had them appraised by the District Water and Sanitation Teams (DWSTs) and approved for
financing.

2.3.3   Cost sharing method was used where the communities organized themselves to raise 5 percent of
the capital costs of the infrastructure and full cost for operation and maintenance. Local government
authorities contributed 5 percent of the counterpart funding.

2.3.4   The project funds were channeled directly to the project district councils by the Ministry and
audited by the auditors quarterly. This financing mechanism has built the capacity of the district
accountants and helps the service providers to get their payments in time.

2.3.5   Implementation of the project design, supervision, drilling of water wells, and construction of
water facilities was carried out with full participation of the private sector (Consultants, contractors,
suppliers etc.). There was knowledge transfer from all sides; the Private sector, Communities and District
councils, thus building capacity for sustaining the investments.

2.3.6   Key performance indicators were used to monitor physical progress of the project and
performance in operational, financial and institutional matters. Quarterly reports were prepared by the
FSPs and Technical Service Providers (TSPs) and reviewed by the DWSTs. Relevant findings in the
quarterly reports were carried over for further improvement of the project implementation.

2.3.7   Capacity building was implemented concurrently with the implementation of the project. This led
to substantial improvement of capacity of the DWSTs and communities in the areas of financial, technical,
operation and maintenance and feedback systems; thus creating an enabling environment for
sustainability of the infrastructure.



                                                     45

2.3.8    The issue of the project's linkage with water resources management was addressed during
implementation. Designs provided water for livestock which has improved people's health by avoiding
sharing domestic water sources with livestock. Education of communities on the need for preservation of
water sources will impact the sustainability of water sources.

2.4      Assessment of operation experience

2.4.1    This project was the first of its kind in rural areas, involving a whole range of actors - NGOs,
Consultants, Drillers, Contractors and Suppliers in facilitation services, consultancy services, drilling
works and construction of water facilities. This provided a good experience for all stakeholders.

2.4.2    The involvement of communities in all stages of implementation has resulted in greater
awareness of their water facilities. Communities have changed the perceptions that water projects are
properties of the Government. Now operate and maintain their projects successfully.

2.4.3    Some of the communities contracted private operators to operate and maintain their water
schemes. Experience shows that the private operators perform better in revenue collection compared to
water committees. For example, private operators in the Berege, Sazima and Chiseyu districts collect
enough monthly revenue from these communities to reasonably cover operation and maintenance costs.

2.4.4    Communities collecting revenue using the flat rate system paid on a monthly basis show that the
revenue collected is not enough to sustain O&M costs. Paying per buckets of water filled has chalked
greater success.

2.4.5    During implementation, the Ministry transferred the project funds to the respective districts for
expenditure for the project activities. Experience shows that the speed of the district accountant to make
replenishment was not satisfactory; this resulted in late payments to implementers.

2.4.6    At the beginning, project funds sent to the districts did not indicate the exact amount to be used
for sanitation and hygiene and this resulted in low progress on sanitation. The situation was later rectified
and a specified amount for sanitation was sent to districts. This step improved implementation of
sanitation activities accordingly.

2.4.7    A handpump supply chain that includes private retail outlets has being established to supply and
distribute spare parts. This is a new experience where the communities can get pumps and spares in the
district outlets without going to regional headquarters or Dar es Salaam as it was in the past.

2.4.8    Ten sub-projects on Innovation Window (IW) were implemented under RWSSP. Experience has
shown that some of the sub-projects lack innovativeness. In future, IW sub-projects with innovative ideas
should be selected.

3.1      Project components

The project had three main components. The highlights of achievements are as follows;

3.1.1    DWSTs successfully established in 12 districts. Their implementation has assisted the
communities to form structures which will enable them to run and maintain their sub-projects in a
sustainable manner. DWSTs are still required to provide knowledge in an effective way for communities
on managing, monitoring and reporting.




                                                     46

3.1.2    District Water and Sanitation Funds (DWSFs) have been established in all 12 project districts.
Community contribution for the first year investment program for the first 3 pilot districts is 100% and
65% in the second year. In the additional 9 districts, contribution ranged from 19% to 92%. The
communities of Kiteto and Manyoni districts exhibited very low response in contributing. One of the
causes was that they didn't get the FSP to facilitate the communities on the awareness on contribution of
capital investment cost of their sub-projects. For this case the DWST in the respective districts are
required to take additional steps to create awareness among these communities, otherwise sustainability of
the projects will be questionable.

3.1.3    A total of 138 villages' sub-projects and 4 small towns had been identified and appraised. About
121 sub projects and 3 small towns' water projects for Kondoa, Kiomboi, and Kongwa have been built.
The major causes of delays in the completion of 18 sub-projects were drilling of unsuccessful boreholes
in some of the districts and inadequate capacity of the contractors. These projects will be carried over and
implemented through the WSDP.

3.1.4    2,457 out of 2,497 water points have been built. Some 559,030 people were targeted to be served
with clean and safe water after completion of the project. By June, 2008 about 521,630 (93% of the
targeted population) people will have access to improved and sustainable water. Some of the projects are
not operating due to late installation of electricity to run the pumps. In other areas, the contractors are in
final stages of completing the remaining construction works. It is expected that by 30th June 2008 all built
sub projects will be operational.

3.1.5    The sanitation sub-component has achieved its target satisfactorily. The target was to promote
hygiene, sanitation, and HIV/AIDS mitigation and prevention. A total of 147 communities were educated
on sanitation and hygiene, 540 artisans trained on production and installation of SanPlat and about 3,690
SanPlat produced. Accordingly, a total of 220 demonstration latrines were built in schools and in
community centers.

3. 2     Investment in community based water supply and sanitation sub-projects

3.2.1    Conditional grants are being allocated to water supply and sanitation projects proposed by
communities themselves for drilled wells, boreholes with hand pumps, piped systems using pumped water
from boreholes or gravity-fed water from springs and rivers, lakes etc. The DWSTs employed local
NGOs and firms as facilitation service providers (FSPs) and consultant engineers as technical service
providers (TSPs) for carrying-out feasibility studies, design and construction supervision. A handpump
supply chain center that includes private retail outlet is being established to distribute hand pumps and
spare parts for hand pumps.

3.3      Institutional strengthening and development at the National level

3.3.1    This component included (a) the support to stakeholder consultative process on the strategy for
scaling up towards a National RWSS Program; (b) technical assistance to the National RWSS program;
(c) the development of a Management Information System (MIS) for tracking lessons learned from the
proposed project; (d) assistance to the restructuring of RWSS sector institutions within MoW; and (e)
building the capacity of key stakeholders (MoW, NGOs, consultants, contractors, supplier of equipment
and service providers).

3.3.2    The RWSSP was launched by holding a stakeholders workshop on 15th October 2002 in Dar es
Salaam. A Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) comprised of multi-sector disciplinary stakeholders was
formed and has been active during the life of the project. The committee's functions were streamlined



                                                       47

into the Water Sector Working Group (WSWG) and the Thematic Groups of the WSDP. The NRWSSP is
already endorsed by the WSWG and its implementation started.

3.3.3    The Project Management Support (PMS) consultant, Co-water International, Inc., of Canada won
the tender to assist the government to: (a) carry out a demand assessment for the NRWSSP, (b) prepare a
technical report establishing the capital and O&M costs and investment forecasts; (c) prepare a training
and capacity building strategy on which the on-going CAPSTART is based, (d) carry out the annual
technical audit for the first and second years of project implementation as well as to prepare the MTR
report, (e) prepare the draft NRWSSP document which was used as the Rural WSS component of the
National Water Sector Development Program; (f) prepare the district grant allocation guidelines; (g)
review and update implementation tools such as the POM and the DOM, and, (h) prepare the initial
design of the MIS for the implementation of the NRWSSP. An addendum was effected on the PMS
contract to support MoW in the finalization of Urban WSS and WRM component of the Water Sector
Support Program and to prepare the harmonized document for the Water and Sanitation Development
Program.

3.3.4    Installation of MIS is complete at the Ministry of Water's head office and in all 12 districts. Two
people in each of the districts have been trained. The systems in 9 districts out 12 are operational.
Systems in 3 districts are not operating due to defective computers. This has affected the data collection in
the districts.

3.3.5    RWS department of the Ministry of Water was mainstreamed and integration of project activities
into the RWSD was done as required in the PAD. The assistant directors (O&M, construction and
design) are now responsible for driving various aspects for the projects under the leadership of the
Director of Community Water Supply.

3.3.6    Several training and capacity building activities have been performed during the project period.
Training manuals and materials have been developed and distributed to all levels.                   Start up
orientation/training (CAPSTART) has been carried out for all DWST in all districts in the country ahead
of the National RWSS Program. Activities were initiated to support selected private sector firms and
companies in the form of support grants for leasing of equipment. These activities did not go far enough
and there is need for enhancement ahead of the implementation of the National RWSS Program. Key
areas will include boosting up drilling capacity, FSP orientation for community planning and
management of schemes.

                                                        due to defective computers. This has affected the data
                                                        collection in the districts




  5.      Main Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

  5.1     Factors outside the Control of Borrower

  5.1.1   The majority of the supplies required for the construction and rehabilitation of water facilities are
  not manufactured in the country and the contractors and suppliers had to import from outside the country.
  Pumps, water meters and some of the pipes are not manufactured in Tanzania. The process of procuring
  these materials from other countries takes a long time. For example when a supplier ordered the pumps it
  took about 3 months for the manufacturer to produce the required amount of pumps. The beneficiaries
  found this process too long. This delay seriously affected project implementation.




                                                      50

5.1.2    The low capacity of some contractors in terms of equipment, staff and finances to execute the
work according to schedule in the contract affected the timely implementation of some of the projects.

5.1.3    Other communities opted for borehole as their source of supply but during drilling the boreholes
were found to be dry. The consultant had to re-survey to find an alternative source which would provide
water to the community. Time taken to resurvey and drill another borehole delayed the implementation of
the project.

5.1.4    During the rainy season some of the rural roads were impassable so it was difficult for the
contractors to continue with the construction and drilling works. The rainy season lasts for about three
months in a year resulting in delays of some of the sub-projects.

5.1.5    Private sector participation in construction of water facilities has recently been introduced in
Tanzania. Earlier on these works were performed by government staff. Because of this reason, some of
the contractors lack experience in bidding for the water projects. Some bid very low, so were unable to
complete the works as per time schedule and this affected timely implementation. On other sub-projects,
the contractors absconded from the site after finding out the cost of the actual work to be done was way
above their bid price. These resulted in terminating some of the contractors and others were deployed.
All these processes affected the completion period of the projects.

6.       Sustainability

6.1      Community involvement in the planning, design, implementation and operation and maintenance
of their sub-projects is a key to sustainability.

6.2      Having water communities with water funds and opening bank accounts for all the constructed
sub-projects is an indication that they will operate and manage their projects. The funds will be used for
operation and maintenance in case of any breakdown.

6.3      Two to three caretakers from each sub-project were trained to assist communities in performing
regular maintenance by servicing of engines and pumps as per required schedule. Breakdowns are
attended to on time because the caretakers are available in the village.

6.4      Women are the worst victims if the sub-projects are not functioning so involvement of women as
members of Water Committees will make the sub-projects sustainable.


7.       World Bank Performance

7.1      Lending

7.1.1    Preparation of the project involved 14 Bank staff specialists with different disciplines which
facilitated the preparation, negotiations and finally the Bank approval of the project on 21st March 2002.
The advice from comprehensive mix of the staff helped the project to start as it was planned.

7.2      Supervision

7.2.1    The performance of Bank staff during supervision is rated highly satisfactory.            During
implementation there were ten regular supervision missions, the last one before this assessment was in
May 2008. All the supervision missions included Bank staff with a reasonable mix of skills. The missions
gave a lot of support and advice to the implementing agency, as well as promoting and enforcing more


                                                     51

effective implementation. Reasonable attention was given to key staff of the implementing agency to
discuss implementation challenges in sufficient detail. The satisfactory overall outcome of the project can
be partly attributed to the capacity of the team to transfer knowledge to Government and District council
staff. Aide Memoires left behind by the team, have been detailed, clear and useful to the Borrower in
following up progress on the project.

7.3      Country Bank Office Staff

7.3.1    Throughout the implementation there was enormous support from the country Bank staff. For all
issues requiring prior review, the Bank reacted in time and if assistance was required they did not hesitate
to cooperate with the Borrower. The task manager responded punctually and effectively to request for
"No Objection" throughout the duration of the project. The team always visited some of the project
districts and used the opportunity to advise DWSTs, consultants and contractors which hastened the
implementation of the sub-projects.

7.4      Overall Bank Performance

7.4.1    Based on the above evaluation, the Banks overall performance is rated as satisfactory.

8.       Borrowers Performance

8.1      The Borrower views its performance highly successful, being the first pilot project on RWSS of
its kind where the National Water Policy principles for rural water supply and development were tested
and satisfactorily achieved.

8.2      The Government demonstrated a high level of commitment during preparation of the project and
gave full support to the World Bank staff who were involved in the preparation. Bank team was provided
with all relevant documents required by them.

8.3      The project did not experience the counterpart funds constraints as the Government always made
the required funds available and on time thus, meeting its obligation as per the Project Development
Credit Agreement.

9.       Lessons learned

9.1      The following lessons have been learnt in the course of implementation of the project:

9.1.1    Involvement of communities at all stages of implementation of the project (planning, design,
construction and post construction) has strengthened the sense of ownership. Communities understood
that it is their responsibility to operate and maintain water projects for sustainability. The traditional
thinking that water projects are property of the government has been altered. For some of the
communities' willingness to pay for water is no more an issue.

9.1.2    Gender balance in Water Committees is a remarkable success for operating and managing water
funds. As the major beneficiaries of improved water services, women must be adequately represented in
water users' organizations. In many cases, it has been shown that people trust their female representatives
more than their male representatives. It is often women who are chosen to take charge of money collected
from consumers.




                                                     52

9.1.3   Quality of the consultancy services and construction works depend to a large extent on the
keenness of the procuring entity of the district to procure quality consultants, contractors and suppliers.
Quality service providers completed their tasks as per required schedule.

9.1.4   Supervision of the consultant depends on an alert DWST. For the districts in which their DWSTs
were active the implementation of the sub-projects were implemented as per design and with high quality.
However, the DWSTs are required to be trained on contract management in order to be smart during
implementation of various contracts.

9.1.5   Implementation of RWSSP required communities to contribute 5% of the cost of their sub-project
in cash. This target has been difficult to achieve by some of the communities whose sub-project (such as
piped scheme) was expensive. Furthermore, contribution in kind was not taken into consideration.
Therefore, in the future there is a need to determine community contributions by considering technology
options and in kind contributions.

9.1.6   Confirmation of water sources has to take place before design of water supply scheme. This will
limit the probability of making Variation Orders to signed contracts.

9.1.7   Hydrogeological and geophysical investigation of water sources has to be given more emphasis in
order to reduce the number of dry boreholes.

9.1.8   Implementation of some of the sub-projects did not follow a proper sequence of activities. Since
drilling and civil works contracts were signed at the same time, it resulted into some areas having civil
works completed without confirmation on water sources.

9.1.9   A single contracting of technical services and facilitation services to one consultant would
minimize confusion to the communities. Different consultants used in facilitation and technical services
may interpret the project concept differently to the community.
