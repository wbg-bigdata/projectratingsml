HUANGPU PORT PROJECT
(LOAN 2877/CREDIT 1845-CHA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Huangpu Port
Project in China for which Loan 2877 for $63 million and Credit 1845 for $25 million
were approved on October 6, 1987. The loan/credit were closed on December 31, 1994,
after being extended once for one year. Final disbursement was made on May 4, 1995.
The credit was fully disbursed, but $2.23 million of the loan amount was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Messrs. Toshiro Tsutsumi (Task Manager) and Han-
Kang Yen (Economic and Financial Analyst) of the Transport Operations Division, China
and Mongolia Department of the East Asia and Pacific Region and reviewed by Messrs.
Richard Scurfield, Chi 'f, EA2TP and Yo Kimura, Project Adviser, EA2DR. The
Borrower provided comments that are included as appendixes.
Preparation of this ICR was started just before the project closing date and is
based on the material in the project file. The Borrower contributed by preparing its own
evaluation of the project execution and initial preparation.

HUANGPU PORT PROJECT
(LOAN 2877/CREDIT 1845-CHA)
EVALtJATION SUMMARY
Objectives
Huangpu Port, in the Pearl River estuary, is the largest in South China and serves
the Provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei and Hunan, among others. It is 130 km
northwest of Hong Kong and connected to the South China Sea by a navigation channel.
The main objective of the project was to assist the Government of the People's
Republic of China (GOC) to relieve congestion in the port of Huangpu and increase its
handling capacity. It did this by providing additional facilities and improving the
planning, managerial and operational capabilities of its staff. Specifically, the Bank
assisted in financing: (a) construction of the new Xinsha terminal (1,700 m long) for
coal, iron ore, bulk fertilizer, general cargo, lighters and service boats equipped with a
modem cargo handling system, and (b) technical assistance for studies and staff training.
Implementation Experience and Results
The project became effective on October 3, 1988. Project launch was quick and
smooth, with major contracts in civil works awarded shortly after loan effectiveness. The
components financed by the Bank Group were completed satisfactorily by December 31,
1994, after a one-year delay in supplying a coal and iron ore handling system. Technical
assistance and training have also been satisfactorily implemented.
Despite the delay, implementation was considered satisfactory-the main
objectives were achieved. The construction of physical components, procurement of
equipment and implementation of studies proceeded smoothly, mainly due to their lack of
complexity and good coordination between the Guangzhou Harbor Bureau (GHB) and
the Ministry of Communications (MOC).  The Bank-financed components were
implemented by one executing entity, the GHB.
Bid evaluations, which in China require two steps-one by the end-user and
another by the central evaluation committee-generally required about six months.
However, under this project, procurement was about two months shorter, except for the
bid for fertilizer unloaders that required 13 months (see paras. 9-13).
The final project cost was Y 543.69 million plus $86.93 million instead of the
Y 668.53 million and $88.0 million estimated at appraisal-lower due to savings in
physical contingency and competitive bidding prices. Estimated base costs were nearly



- 111 -
correct. Domestic price increase in 1993 did not have a major impact on project cost
since the significant civil works were completed before 1993 (para. 20). A total of
$2,261,034.18 was canceled.
The project's economic rate of return (at completion) was estimated at 32.7
percent against 21.3 percent at appraisal, which is considered satisfactory.
GHB's financial performance has so far been satisfactory. However, GHB is
currently unable to operate as a financially autonomous corporation, since tariff setting is
still controlled by the central Government. Without competition between ports or within
the port, liberalization of tariffs is not deemed appropriate. Government still controls
tariffs so as to encourage the port to increase efficiency while restraining the
opportunities for the port to abuse its position as a regional monopoly. However, in the
long term some accommodation will be required and cost increases borne by the port
operation must be reflected in higher tariffs.
Findings and Lessons Learned
The project is sustainable (para. 40). Most importantly, port traffic will grow, due
to the rapid economic development of the Guangzhou area. Also, GHB is a financially
stable entity. Moreover, with the modem equipment and extensive training provided
under the project, GHB has the potential to increase the port's productivity.
The findings and lessons from project implementation include the following:
(a)   Bidding documents for the procurement of large equipment should provide
specific postqualification criteria to avoid confusion during the evaluation;
(b)   Tariffs should be adjusted every year, based on the local price index or
some other reasonable indicator. GHB has no authority to set its own
tariffs and revenue gains were offset by cost increases that were even
higher;
(c)   GHB still has room to improve performance by improving management
techniques and periodically revaluing fixed assets. GHB should also
consider introducing competition among terminal operators to improve
efficiency;
(d)   The simple project design, which involved one executing agency under
one ministry, is considered a key reason for the satisfactory
implementation; and
(e)   It is recommended that GHB update the master plan of the port
periodically, since the port serves one of the country's most rapidly
developing areas and traffic patterns will change quickly. Also, the
relationship with other nearby ports such as Shenzhen and Hong Kong
should be considered.

CHINA
HUANGPU PORT PROJECT
(LOAN 2877/CREDIT 1845-CHA)
PART I. IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.   In the mid-1980s when this project was identified, most of China's ports were
badly congested, with shortages of container berths, bulk cargo berths, port equipment,
storage yards and transport infrastructure for distribution. Congestion was sufficiently
severe as to threaten to hold back further expansion of China's foreign trade. Huangpu
Port, South China's largest port and serving Guangdong Province, among others, had
become particularly congested due to the port's location at the confluence of three rivers,
which merge into the Pearl River estuary between Guangzhou and Hong Kong. The port
is some 130 km northwest of Hong Kong and is connected to the South China Sea by a
11 5-km navigation channel.
2.    The main project objective was to increase Huangpu port's efficiency in handling
bulk and general cargo and by providing specialized berths with modem equipment.
Another aim was to improve efficiency over the long term by providing training; and
technical assistance for studies relating to: (a) the port's master plan, (b) management
and operations, and (c) upgrading of the inlet channel.
3.    Development of Huangpu port under the project consisted of:
(a)   A new Xinsha terminal of five berths-one each for coal, iron ore and
bulk fertilizer, and two for general purposes. This component required:
(i)    Construction of a 600-m quaywall with alongside depth of 11.0 m
for coal, iron ore, and bulk fertilizer berths; construction of a
400-m quaywall with alongside depth of 11.0 m for general cargo
berths; and construction of a 700-m wharf with alongside depth of
4.0 m for lighters and harbor operations vessels. The quaywalls
were designed with alongside depth of 12.5 m for future use;
(ii)    Basin dredging and land reclamation;



- 2 -
(iii)    Dredging of a channel east of the new terminal (approximately
7 km);
(iv)    Construction of various types of infrastructure (to serve the future
berths at Xinsha as well as those in the Huangpu project);
a.    Two railway bridges and two highway bridges;
b.    Rail lines, roadways and yard pavements;
c.    Water supply, sewerage and power supply connections;
d.    Maintenance buildings, auxiliary buildings, etc.;
(v)    Procurement of ancillary  items such as loading/unloading
equipment, navigational aids, surveying equipment and boats;
(b)   Training of personnel in China and abroad in operating and maintaining
the new facilities;
(c)   Technical assistance, including training of counterpart staff in supervising
construction, producing specialized designs and managing and operating
the port; and
(d)   Studies, such as an update of the master plan for Huangpu port (which
included a review of intermodal cargo distribution in Huangpu and its
hinterland), and another to optimize improvements to the inlet channel.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Project Implementation
4.    This was the third Bank-assisted port project in China, following the Three Ports
Project (Loan 2207, 1982) and the Tianjin Port Project, (Loan 2689, 986). Under the
Three Ports (Huangpu, Shanghai and Tianjin) Project, coal and container terminals at
Huangpu Port were provided successfully. This project was an extension of Huangpu
Port downstream of the Pearl River.
5.    After Board approval and before signing of the legal documents, Huangpu
Harbour Bureau (HHB) merged with Guangzhou Port to become the Guangzhou Harbour
Bureau (GHB). This did not create significant problems, because the new charter was
carried out on time and GHB accepted the Project Agreement as negotiated. However,
the signing was slightly delayed while the charter for the new agency was prepared.
6.    Civil Works. Two civil works contracts were financed by the Bank. The first
was for marine works (this included the main quay construction). Construction was
initially delayed for about 5-6 months, but this delay was made up after the contractor



- 3 -
improved its management techniques, the quantity of construction equipment available on
the site was increased and coordination improved between GHB's supervision team and
the resident engineer. Also, the local contractor and GHB were initially unfamiliar with
international contract procedures (FIDIC).
7.    The second contract for construction of land works was satisfactorily
implemented and completed in accordance with the progress of the other works such as
railway construction and installation of the cargo handling system for coal and fertilizer.
GHB  retained the supervision consultants for the second contract.  Improved
familiarization of GHB's supervision team with international practice under the first
contract was a factor in the satisfactory implementation of the second contract.
8.    In addition to the Bank-financed construction works, GHB contracted many other
civil works with local contractors (more than 90 contracts through local funding), which
have been satisfactorily completed and coordinated with the Bank-financed component
(railway, road, etc.). Procurement for these varied depending on the size and nature of
the work, from sole-source basis to local competitive bidding (LCB). Implementation by
the local contractors was satisfactory and there were no major problems.
9.    Procurement of Equipment. The main equipment was procured through ICB
(Table 5C) for handling coal/iron ore, general cargo and fertilizer, along with other
equipment (such as tugboats and portal cranes) purchased through cost savings.
Procurement was, for the most part, satisfactory. The bid evaluation period was generally
two months shorter than that of other similar projects, although some delays occurred
with (a) preparing bid documents and evaluating bids, and (b) implementing contracts for
the coal/iron ore handling system.
10.   Although GHB gained experience in Bank financing under the Three Ports
Project, preparation of bid documents was delayed due to the complexity of both
coal/iron ore handling system and fertilizer bagging system. With respect to the first of
these, GHB needed about two years to prepare bid documents for four ship unloaders,
five stackers/reclaimers, and a conveyor and weighing system. The contract amounted to
over $40 million.
11.   There was also a nine-month delay in the supply of this handling system for coal
and iron ore. This was due to (a) special circumstances (prices escalated and domestic
steel was in short supply) after the design was produced and (b) the contractor's limited
experience in coordinating the various manufacturers (including foreign firms). The
joint-venture contractor, which had experience with a similar size project as a
subcontractor, was awarded the contract after a long discussion between GOC and the
Bank about the contractor's qualifications-on the condition that subcontracted foreign
manufacturers would provide performance security.
12.   The contractor found it difficult to satisfactorily coordinate its activities with
those of the foreign manufacturers (who were assembling the system) and to correct



- 4 -
teething problems with various parts of the system discovered during trial runs. GHB
delayed approving the system until March 1995, after the required corrections were made.
13.   With respect to the fertilizer bagging system, GHB/GOC needed 13 months to
evaluate and finalize the bid for one of the ship unloaders. However, the time could have
been reduced if the postqualification criteria in the bid documents had been more specific.
Moreover, although only two companies bid, the one that was lower had no experience
supplying a fertilizer unloader. And, while GHB required bidders to have experience
with at least five units of similar or superior types of equipment in the last 10 years, it
could not easily conclude if experience with a grain unloader was sufficient. As a result,
the lower bidder was found not qualified and the Bank accepted this decision. Once the
decision had been made the equipment was delivered in less time than stated in the
contract. Thus, the long evaluation period did not affect implementation for the entire
fertilizer handling system.
14.   Technical Assistance and Training. The project included four studies on (a)
special designs for marine structure, (b) management and operations, (c) the master plan
and (d) the navigation channel (Table 7, Part II), of which the Bank was supposed to
finance (a) and (b). However, foreign consultants found it difficult to acquire the
information needed for the studies of management and operations. Therefore, the Bank
only financed the special design study which was completed satisfactorily and applied
during the construction of the marine works.
15.   GHB then combined studies (b) and (c), using local funds and local corsultants.
Despite this change implementation of the studies was also satisfactory. For cxample, the
management and operation study recommended a specialization and improvement of
terminals. Following the recommendations, GHB has converted 2 existing coal berths
(#1-2) into a fertilizer terminal, increased storage capacity of the Xingang terminal and
improved daily operation through on-the-job training.  GHB  also has initiated
construction of berth Nos. 6-10 by extending the project terminals (berths Nos. 1-5),
following the recommendation of the Master Plan Study. Through the improvement,
berth capacity has been increased, berths' throughput was raised and vessel berthing time
was reduced (see Table 6, Part II). The Master Plan, however, should be updated, since
economic, as well as infrastructure, development in this area is significant, and traffic
demand projections should be revised in accordance with these changes.
16.   Training. GHB established a new terminal company [Xinsha Terminal Company
(XTC)] to manage the new facilities financed through the project. Although the number
of trained staff was lower than planned (1,398 compared to 1,903), training was
considered appropriate and satisfactory (Table 5B, Part II). GHB decided to downsize the
new company (XTC). It was able to do this because it extended the mechanized cargo
handling system and raised the productivity of the company. Thus, instead of a staff of
1,903, as estimated in the SAR, the company currently has only about 1,000 employees
(592 regular staff, and 400 fixed term workers), and also uses another 386 workers from



various other terminal companies when necessary. All staff, including workers in the
other companies, were trained under the project.
17.   GHB is considered a capable and sustainable company. A total of 162 staff were
transferred from the original terminal and office of GHB, and are experienced managers.
GHB has sent these and other staff to the several training courses (in management,
planning, designing and operation) that were organized by port authorities in developed
countries. Domestic training has also been implemented by using a local training center.
Project Results
18.   All project objectives were achieved during implementation:
(a)   Bottlenecks at the port were removed with the addition of the five new
specialized berths; the handling of coal, iron ore, bulk fertilizer and
general cargo using modem equipment;
(b)   Long-term efficiency gains cannot be documented yet; however, early
results are very positive. The project's institutional goals have also been
achieved substantially, through the provision of TA; and
(c)   The project's benefits were also achieved, including savings in (a) cargo-
handling costs, (b) ship waiting and berthing time, and (c) cargo handling
time. The economic rate of return (ERR) of the project is estimated at
32.7 percent against the 21.3 percent in the SAR.
19.   Although the project was modified somewhat, this did not change its overall
objectives. The major modification included converting the iron ore berth (No. 2 berth)
into one that could also handle coal (to expand coal handling capacity), involving
increase in the arnount of equipment purchased. GHB asked the Bank to approve the
modification (which was at the No. 2 terminal), at a cost of $8.5 million; the Bank
approved the request.  No environmental or resettlement problems arose during
implementation.
20.   The project's final cost is estimated at Y 543.69 million plus $86.93 million,
against Y 668.53 million and $88.0 million calculated at appraisal. Total costs were less
than estimated, mainly because of the savings gained in physical contingency, and
competitive bidding prices. Estimated base costs were nearly correct. No call was made
on the physical contingencies (10 percent of the base cost, estimated at $12 million). A
total of $2,261,034.18 was canceled. Domestic price hikes in 1993 did not have a major
impact on project costs since substantial civil works were completed before this time.
21.   Decentralization. Immediately prior to signature of the loan in January 1988, the
process of decentralizing the management and financial administration of various ports,
from the State (MOC) to the local municipal governments, was begun. Port authorities of
the municipalities assumed a large part of the responsibility, handling daily management,



- 6 -
operations, construction, budgetary and development functions. However, although
major projects and plans affecting the port's long-term development still need to be
approved by the MOC, the ports now bear the financial obligations for any loans
obtained. As the ports will be covering the loans, the Government reduced the tax rate,
by requiring them to make an annual flat rate payment (not based on their earnings). This
enhanced the ports' internal cash generation by reducing an annual fixed tax obligation to
the Government (in 1988); to date, this arrangement has not changed substantially.
22.   Decentralization has given freedom to ports to administer their own financial and
management structure. GHB now only needs Government approval for rehabilitation
projects of over Y 30 million. Other key financial terms of the restructuring are as
follows:
(a)   a much reduced annual lump sum payment up to 1992:
(i)   of Y 1.87 million (instead of Y 55.7 million for 1986) for income
and adjustment taxes; and
(ii)   of Y 9.45 million for Government's Energy and Transport Fund,
including tax on port construction; and
(b)   a flat annual contribution of Y 11.0 million from 1993.
23.   Reorganization. In December 1987, Huangpu Port (HP) was merged with
Guangzhou Port, given the new name of Guangzhou Harbor Bureau (GHB), and became
the Huangpu District (HD) of GHB. Financially, lID is the main source of income for
GHB. In 1994, for example, HD's total assets, operating revenues and net profits
constituted 79.1 percent, 75.8 percent and 77.5 percent, respectively, of GHB's. When
figures in this report are compared with those of the SAR, they pertain only to the HD (of
GHB).
24.   New Financial Reporting Procedures.  Under MOF's instructions, GHB
improved its financial accounting procedures in July 1993 to keep in line with
international accounting standards. The new accounting and reporting systems will
accelerate the commercialization and privatization of the port.
25.   Past Financial Performance. The port's financial performance during 1985-94
was satisfactory. A comparison of actual performance with estimates in the SAR for
1985-93 (the last forecast year available in that document) indicates the same average
annual growth rate of net profit as in the SAR (14.8 percent), although traffic grew by
11.7 percent per year, instead of the 7.5 percent per year estimated. For example, traffic
handled in 1993 was 37 percent higher than the estimate at appraisal (29.8 million tons in
the SAR vs. 40.8 million tons in the ICR). The net profit for HP in 1993 was Y 77.4
million (against Y 77.2 million forecast), mainly because the 19 percent annual increase
in operating revenues (12.9 percent per year forecast in the SAR) was offset by high
operating costs (a growth of 27.8 percent per year instead of the 14.9 percent forecast). In



- 7 -
1994, operating costs grew even more, by 65.2 percent, to Y 615.9 million; during this
time, traffic increased by 7.2 percent (to 43.8 million tons).
26.   The SAR's conservative financial forecasts were developed when there were rigid
tariff and price controls on almost every major commodity at the State level. As a result,
cost increases and inflation were rare.  In addition, the State had allocated major
resources during the previous three decades (including the allocation of traffic for many
commodities) and only charged users the planned prices. When the SAR was prepared,
there was no indication that either the cost of resources or the rate of inflation would
change. Therefore, financial forecasts assumed that port charges would remain virtually
constant; and the rate of inflation would be low (in the range of 4.5 percent-7.5 percent
during 1986-93). Although reasonable at the time, these assumptions now appear very
conservative due to the much higher than expected cost-push inflation.
27.   In recent years, price controls were removed from  almost all commodities.
During 1985-94, despite the strict control of the State on tariff increases, unit tariffs rose
by an average of 10.5 percent per year. This increase, however, still could not match the
18.2 percent annual average unit cost hike, mainly due to the increased cost of fuel,
materials, wages and depreciation-most of which have to be paid on the basis of market
prices; and, increases in the latter have been much faster than in regulated Government
tariffs. Highlights of the HD's income statements for selected years, as compared with
the SAR forecast, are summarized below with details shown in Table 1.1, Annex 1.

28.   Operating ratios deteriorated and were higher than the targets (for 1993, 66.8
percent against 45.4 percent in the SAR). This was due to rapid increases in costs with
no matching increases in tariffs. Without a reformn in tariffs to expand the port's revenue,
it is estimated that operating costs will exceed revenues in 2000 (based on average growth
rates of operating costs and revenues during 1985-94).
29.   The rate of return on average net fixed assets (RRFA), although still satisfactory,
also declined-from 22.9 percent in 1985 to 12.5 percent in 1993 and 10.3 percent in
1994. This was largely because of the port's decreased profitability and the increase in
fixed assets (the latter due to the project's completion).
30.   GHB's fixed assets are being revalued (RFA) this year (1995). The RFA process
should be completed by December 1995 and the overall value is expected to rise by 20
percent-50 percent. Due to this revaluation, the RRFA in 1995 is expected to be under 9
percent and further declines are forecast.
31.   Present Financial Performance. Despite the rapid rise in operating costs, the
port's financial position was still acceptable at the end of 1994. Debt service in 1993
was the same as the SAR forecast of 1.8 (2.6 in 1994). The percentage of net current
assets in the form of cash, however, declined from 67 percent in 1985 to 65 percent in
1993 and 62 percent in 1994. During the same period, the share of accounts receivable
increased from 12 percent to 25 percent and 28 percent, respectively. Despite the
improved debt and equity ratio of 21.2 percent, the port's current ratio was 0.8 in 1994 (a
ratio of less than 1.0 means the port has short-term solvency problems and needs to
strengthen its finances).
32.   Salient points in the port's balance sheet during these years are found in Table 1.2,
Annex 1 and summarized below:

33.   Future Financial Performance. Under present financial arrangements, despite
the high increase in operating costs, the port still enjoys relatively healthy liquidity,
leverage, and profitability ratios due to the flat lump sum payments made to the State
since the port was decentralized in 1988. This arrangement, as indicated previously, has
not been altered in the last few years. The port's new responsibility for financing all its
capital investments has not yet affected its cash flow (Table 1.3, Annex 1), but this is
expected to weigh more heavily in the future. At present, it is implementing the second
phase of the Xinsha project, for which an additional five berths will be built adjacent to
the Bank-financed berths. Within the next three years, as construction costs will be
substantial, there will be a heavy demand for capital. Thus, port authorities should
explore many alternatives to improve financial conditions.
34.   For the future critical issues which must be addressed include:
(a)    Tariffs: To offset the rapid increase in operating costs, port tariffs should
be adjusted every year by either referring to the local general price index
or charging higher rates for use of the modern, more efficient berths;
(b)    Revaluation of fixed assets (RFA):  To improve the port's financial
capacity to replace its aging equipment, RFA should be carried out more
frequently than in the past;
(c)   Investments: Based on current tariffs, port construction will benefit ship
and cargo owners more than the port; thus, the ports cannot cover all the
costs. For this reason, either tariffs should be further increased, or the
Government should finance some of the noncash generated infrastructure
investments (including foundations for the berths, channels, breakwaters,
and railways/roads in the port);
(d)    Foreign exchange risks: Due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate,
the port paid an additional 130.0 million Yuan for its foreign loans (until
the end of 1994). If this situation continues, it will deteriorate the port's
financial condition.  This factor should also be included in tariff
adjustments; and
(e)    Management reforms:  Some nonport activities, such as schools and
hospitals, should be transferred to local agencies, and their costs not
assumed by the port.
Economic Evaluation
35.   The economic analysis in this report was based on the reevaluation of data on
traffic, operational performance, and the economic costs and benefits of project
components since estimates were provided in the SAR. The methodology used in the
ICR was similar to that in the SAR:



- 10-
(a)   Capital investment and maintenance costs were revised to reflect
December 1994 prices and included in the cost stream;
(b)   The benefits, also reflected in December 1994 prices, were included and
consist of savings in port handling, ship port time (berth and waiting), and
cargo port time (berth and waiting);
(c)   A project life of 20 years was assumed and the capital investment period
for all berths was from 1987 to 1994; and
(d)   Benefits started to accrue for the general cargo berths in 1993.  For
fertilizer, iron ores and coal berths, benefits began in 1995.
36.   When reviewing all the components together, the major negative affects of the
increase in economic capital costs (by 14.2 percent), and the lower ship port costs (by 14-
30 percent) were offset by the much higher than expected cargo traffic (by 49 percent)
(Annex 2).
37.   After reassessing the revised data, the reevaluated economic internal rate of return
(REIRR) was 32.7 percent, which is higher than the SAR estimate of 21.3 percent. A
detailed analysis is presented in Annex 2.
38.   The REIRR and SAR estimates of the project in terms of economic rate of return
and net present value (NPV) are given below:
SAR           ICR
Best estimate of rate of return (%)   21.3           32.7
NPV (12%, million Yuan)               n.a.         1,756.2
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
39.   Major factors affecting the project are summarized as follows:
Positive factors include:
(a)   The regional and national developing economy, which increased port
traffic;
(b)   The Borrower's capacity to implement projects;
(c)   The simplicity of the project design; and
(d)   The close relationship between the Borrower and Bank.



Negative factors include:
(a)   Cost increase during implementation that significantly raised port
operating costs and offset the revenue increase;
(b)   A shortage of materials that delayed the implementation of equipment
contracts; and
(c)   The Borrower's lack of familiarity with preparing bid documents for large,
complex equipment.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
40.   The project is considered sustainable. First, it extended the port facilities and
improved productivity. Further, port traffic will grow along with the development of the
Guangzhou area. In addition, GHB is a financially stable entity with the financial
resources needed to maintain and operate the port efficiently. Moreover, with the modem
equipment and extensive training offered under the project, GHB has the potential to
increase the port's productivity even further and provide service competitively.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
41.   The Bank's performance in identifying issues and preparing the project was good.
Bank staff resources leading to appraisal were efficient (88.7 staff-weeks) as were those
applied to supervision: the annual average input was 9.5 staff-weeks (see Table 12).
42.   However, the Bank's performance could have been improved if more specific
postqualification criteria had been recommended for bidding documents for large
equipment (such as for the coal and iron ore handling system and fertilizer ship unloader).
Except for the above, the Bank took a consistent position and provided appropriate
guidance, when necessary.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
43.   The Borrower's performance was generally good and preparation and
implementation were adequate. As shown in Table 10, Part II, covenants were mostly
met. Although HHB merged with GHB just before signing the legal documents (para. 5),
GHB assumed all responsibility for the project and implemented it satisfactorily.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
44.   This project is assessed as satisfactory because it achieved all major objectives
without any major shortcomings.



- 12 -
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
45.   The project provided the facilities needed to handle port traffic until around 2000.
However, it should now be moving into the next phase, since preparing the plan and
constructing facilities will require several years and congestion will mean a loss to the
national economy.
46.   The port's efficiency and financial performance will need to be monitored in the
future, with productivity indicators such as: (a) ship waiting time, and (b) cargo
handling volume per day per vessel, and moves (load/unload) of container boxes per hour
per crane. These will be available from statistics provided by GHB.
47.   GHB has begun to build five additional berths (Nos. 6-10). These will be
financed locally and will meet the immediate demands of increased traffic (general cargo
and grain). Construction is expected to be completed in 1998.
48.   Also, GHB plans to construct new container, coal, grain and petroleum terminals
as well as deepen the channels up to 11.5 m based on the recommendations in the master
plan and channel studies. GHB would like to request Bank financing when the detailed
plan is finalized. Given that Huangpu port is located in the area where economic
development is high, the master plan should be frequently updated according to the
change in traffic patterns. It is important that development in nearby areas and ports,
such as Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and the Pearl River area, be considered.
1. LESSONS LEARNED
49.   The key lessons are the following:
(a)   Bidding documents for procuring large equipment should provide specific
postqualification criteria in order to avoid confusion in the evaluation
period;
(b)   Tariffs should be adjusted every year, based on the local price index and
cost increase factors such as variation of investment and exchange rate, or
some more reasonable indicator(s). Because GHB has no authority to set
its own tariffs, its revenue increase was offset by the price increase (that
was higher than the tariff increase);
(c)   GHB  still has room  to fine-tune performance by improving its
management techniques and periodically revaluing its fixed assets. GHB
should also consider introducing more competition among terminal
operators; and
(d)   The project's simple design, which involved a single executing agency
under a single ministry, is considered a main reason why implementation
was satisfactory.

APPENDIX B: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Section A
' .    Xinsha Terminal Project of Huangpu port of Guangzhou Ilarbour Bureau is an
important project in China which was implemented by GHB, by applying World Bank
loans for in-port project (including marine works, mechanical equipment and major civil
construction) through ICB. The in-port project construction was officially commenced in
October 1988, and the first construction project was marine works. The major projects
had completed and put into operation by the end of 1994. The whole Xinsha Terminal
Project is intend to be accepted by the State Planning Committee in the first half of 1995.
Berths No. 3 and No. 5 of them put into simple operation in the middle of December of
1992, mainly handling bulk material, and have unloaded and loaded more than 400 tons
of bulk materials separately since then.
2.    The project design is advanced and reliable in general layout, equipment
parameters, features and structure type. In general, project objectives are achieved and
the project is a success. That greatly expand Guangzhou port's capacity in cargo traffic
by 9.1 million tons capacity increasing each year.
3.    For construction of the Xinsha project, it adopted large amounts of modem
advanced techniques so that major effectiveness have been made. In marine works, new
structure type of steel pile cellular structure were used. As a result, construction period
has been shortened, cost been saved, the quality of the construction been improved.
Meanwhile, a great number of special personnel were trained and grow up. Necessary
adjustment of the handling processing line of bulk fertilizer berth has been carried out,
that canceled the bulk fertilizer storehouse and the relevant equipment. Thus, it reduced
middle links in the line and reduce the investment as well as the maintenance risk for the
bulk storehouse and its equipment. The handling processing line of coal and iron ore
berth has been considerable improved., the number of necessary equipment increased, so
that every position of the whole system has been strengthened, improved the handling
capacity to satisfy the need of the great increasing of coal and ore by the Guangdong
district. Especially the great improvement for the coal barge loading system to solve
some vulnerable spots of the original system. The modification has resulted in a
considerable important of perfect technology and the improvement of capacity.



- 31 -                     Appendix B
4.    Construction of the following components such as computer managing system,
telecommunication system and VTS, etc. under this project have greatly enhanced the
comprehensive capacity and function of Guangzhou port.
5.    Procurement of over one-hundred units of handling machine, two tugging port
boats, coal and ore handling system equipment and fertilizer handling system equipment
in three special berths were carried out strictly in accordance with the Guidelines set by
the World Bank through ICB. It provides a solid foundation for the development and
traffic increase of Guangzhou port so that it will accelerate the Guangzhou port to be an
international modem one.
6.    The international supervision system has been imported and the method of Sino-
foreign cooperation for the civil works construction supervision was adopted. For the
construction of the marine works and land works, a foreign consulting firm was employed
to provided consultant and training service, and the supervisors from this company and
the personnel of GHB jointly supervised the construction of the marine works and land
works. Consultant service by the foreign consultants, construction supervision and local
and overseas training enable technical and management staff from GHB to widen their
view, learn and obtain some international practice, advanced technology and management
experiences which have enhanced the staffs' ability, and ensured the project quality.
7.    Particular attention was given to environmental protection in accordance with the
regulation of state. Environmental protection facility such as sewage treatment system
and dust proof was equipped at the relevant project contract.
8.    Equipment procurement under this project was executed by an specific
department which comprised experienced persons. They have been trained. They
familiar with technical and commercial business affairs, be skillful at computer operation,
with good ability in English and rich project managing experience. Therefore, the
evaluating speed of the project was quicker compared with other ports. It took generally
about four months from the bids opening to supplying evaluation reports to the World
Bank, and the quicker ones among them even took only one month. A specific project
managing system was organized for the construction of important system bids.
9.    The project design was basically undertaken by the Chinese design institute, i.e.
the Fourth Design Institute of Navigation Engineering of MOC. In general, the design is
a success. The design institute made a great effort to ensure the satisfactory execution of
the project.
10.   Technical documents for marine works, land works and procurement of
equipment system bid were prepared by design institute, and assisted by a foreign
company and consultants and GHB; most technical documents for the bids of other
equipment procurements were prepared by GHB. Some reliable and pipe techniques
were incorporated in the well-drafted technical specification which fully comply with
local actual situation. The tendering work was actually successful.



- 32 -                     Appendix B
11.  In accordance with the requirement of port master plan and development, in the
last project period, more than 30 units and 2 units of large tugging boat of equipment of
six bids were procured by using the Bank's loan savings-more than 10 million Dollars.
It has enhanced the comprehensive capacity of Xinsha port. The tendering work by using
the Bank's loan savings is a great success, and the speed was quick (it took only one
month to evaluate up to supply all the evaluate report to the World Bank). The result of
tendering was satisfactory.
12.   No. 3 and No. 5 berths began operation simply at the end of 1992, mainly bulk
materials handling. There have been nearly 200 ships which were equivalent to more
than 4 million tons have been unloaded since them. The situation of the relevant
mechanical and electrical equipment as well as facilities in these two berths was quite
good.
13.   Generally, the project was implemented strictly following the SAR. Marine
works, land works, environmental protection system, power supply and lighting system,
handling system equipment of fertilizer berths, portal crane and all mobile machinery
system were completed and delivered in the contracted period.
14.   Only the completion of handling and controlling system in berth No. I and berth
No. 2 has delayed for almost one year due to the local situation and experience of the
contractor itself.
15.   Regarding the evaluation of the screw ship unloader, because there were
differences in deciding which bidder was qualified to award the contract, it took a long
time to investigate and study, which caused the evaluation prolongation for another eight
months.  Finally after the joint efforts of both parts of buyer and seller, the
implementation progress of this bid satisfied the requirement of which all the equipment
of the fertilizer berth completed at the same time.
Section B
16.   The ICR drafted by the World Bank is comprehensive. It describes completely all
the major items of the project executed and analysis provide is mainly correct and
complies with the actual conditions.
17.   With respect to the data of each item in the list of ICR. We acknowledge that they
correct and fully show the overall situation.
Section C
18.   From the project appraisal to reimbursement deadline, the World Bank was very
positive and effective. The Guangzhou Harbour Bureau appreciates all officials and
experts from the World Bank who participated in this project for their efforts and their
contributions made to the port development. It gave us deep impression of their strong
sense of seriously responsibility, scientific way in management and spirit of job respect.



- 33 -                     Appendix B
19.   During the whole implementation period, we have been keeping a close
cooperation and mutual respect with the Technical Division, Communication Division,
and Disbursement Division of the Bank. Especially with the guidance on all aspects
granted by the Bank's experts, Guangzhou Harbour Bureau overcame various difficulties
in project executions and completed the project satisfactorily.
20.   Each site supervision mission from the World Bank made a significant effect on
the project execution. They inspected the site situation twice a year and collected first
hand information, resolved problems in the construction to accelerate the construction
procedure by strengthening a mutual understanding and trust so that an easy
understanding can be reached. The Bank's mission gave us great support on savings
application for procurement of container cranes, etc. and also especially extension of
closing date and reallocation of the loan. The Bank officers' instruction, understanding
and quick responses to our request facilitated implementation.

ANNEX 2: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. TRAFFIC
1.    As shown in Table 2.1, traffic in the Huangpu District (HP) of the Guangzhou
Harbor Bureau (GHB) grew faster than the SAR forecast. For example, in 1994, it was
40 percent higher. HP traffic, as well as that related to the project berths, is summarized
as follows.

2.    Despite the severe economic recession in 1990 and 1991, traffic grew an average
of 11.2 percent a year during 1985-94, compared with 7.2 percent estimated in the SAR;
during 1990-94, it was 18.9 percent, instead of 5.3 percent a year forecast. Based on the



-40 -                      ANNEX2
economic activities and long-term development plans in this area, the increase over the
next decades (1995-2020) is estimated to be approximately 2.2 percent a year.
3.    General cargo traffic: Traffic in 1994 was much higher than estimated, by about
72 percent. For the last four years (1990-94), it grew by 19.0 percent a year, instead of
the predicted 2.9 percent a year, and the port needs additional general cargo berths to
meet the demand. Thus, GHB has begun to construct four general cargo berths and one
grain berth adjacent to the berths financed by the Bank.
4.    Iron ore traffic: Most of the iron ore is shipped from foreign sources to meet
domestic demand. It is highly sensitive to local energy supplies: Without sufficient
supply, iron imports are replaced by the finished products (such as iron and steel). In
1994, for example, iron ore imports were about 21 percent lower than the SAR
projection, while traffic in iron and steel was about 43 percent higher than estimated (4.0
million tons vs 2.8 million tons), 75 percent of which was imported. Based on current
forecasts, iron ore traffic should continue to grow, but less than the SAR estimate.
5.    Coal traffic: Coal traffic in 1994 was about 37 percent higher than the SAR
estimate. The high demand for this import reflects the local economy's rapid economic
growth, highly dependent on energy imports. In 1994, all the coal traffic was due to
imports from domestic sources (in the north) and all the coal was consumed locally. The
strong demand has led to congestion at the coal handling terminals. Without additional
facilities, existing terminals (including the project component) may be totally congested
by 2000.
B. SHIP TIME ANALYSIS
6.    General Cargo Carriers: Before the project, in 1985, general cargo carriers
spent an average of 12.4 days as against 4.6 days after the project, in 1994, of which the
ship waiting time in the port (nonproductive time plus weather stoppage) accounted for
8.5 days and 2.5 days, respectively. Over the same period, average working time per ship
(productive time at berth) decreased from 3.9 days to 2.1 days due to the improved
handling. Thus, without the project, the added traffic demand would have lengthened the
ship waiting time (Table 2.2).
7.    Fertilizer Carriers: The number of port days per ship decreased from 20.8 in
1985 to 11.4 days in 1994. During the same period, although the size of the ships did not
change, the average (productive) time needed to unload decreased from 7.1 days to 5.6
days. The new equipment not only improved efficiency but also maximized the
availability of the equipment. The nonproductive time due to the port, for example,
decreased from 7.6 days to only 1.8 days (Table 2.2).
8.    Iron Ore Carriers: Although the number ships carrying iron ore and visiting the
port doubled from 1985-1994, total ship port days per ship dropped sharply from 11.2 per
ship in 1985 to 6.1 days in 1994. With the project, nonproductive time (due to the port)
also dropped sharply, from 7.5 days to 2.0 days (Table 2.2).



-41-                      ANNEX2
9.    Coal Carriers: The number of coal ships visiting the port has increased more
than two times during 1985-94. With the high coal traffic demand, the total ship port
days per ship has dropped from 5.5 days per ship in 1985 to 5.2 day per ship in 1994.
During the same period, the loading/unloading time for each ship (productive time) also
dropped from 2.6 days to 1.5 days. Despite these improvements, however, the high
demand of coal handling caused the ship waiting time in the port (nonproductive time due
to the port) increased from 1.5 days in 1985 to 3.1 days in 1994 (Table 2.2).
C. BERTH OPERATIONS
10.   Operating data for general cargo, fertilizer, iron ore and coal berths at the port also
differ somewhat from the SAR estimates. Detailed operating data used for the economic
revaluation of each project berth are shown in Table 2.3 and highlighted as follows:

D. ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS
Economic Costs
11.   All costs needed to complete the facilities planned under the project were
considered in the economic reevaluation. All inputs and outputs were evaluated in
constant December 1994 economic prices (Table 2.4). Financial costs were converted to
economic costs by shadow pricing each berth's input categories. Conversion factors for
each input category were based on estimates determined in completed Bank studies.
12.   The overall conversion factor is 1.01, of which coal berths are 1.0, while iron ore,
fertilizer and general cargo berths are 1.01. The factors derived for the various cost items
were applied to annual project expenditures to obtain the stream of economic costs (Table
2.5).
13.  In the SAR, the effect of shadow  pricing the project costs was that economic
costs were 17.2 percent higher than financial costs, and total economic costs were
14.2 percent higher than the SAR estimate at constant December 1994 prices. The
comparisons are summarized as follows:

Economic Benefits
14.   The economic analysis focused on the benefits derived from relieving port
congestion. Details of the traffic forecast are shown in Table 2.1. The project will yield



-44 -                      ANNEX2
quantifiable benefits in the form of savings in cargo handling coats, ship time (both
waiting time and operating time), and cargo time (Table 2.6).
15.   Savings in Cargo Handling. Savings are relatively small and are expected to
accrue from the direct costs of cargo handling in the new facilities as compared with the
present ones. Without the project, the only way to handle traffic in excess of berth
capacity would be through "lightening," but it is estimated these costs would be three to
four times greater than normal handling costs. Detailed estimates of handling cost
savings are shown in Table 2.7. Lightening was assumed for cargo tonnage in excess of
berth capacity at 95 percent occupancy, at a cost three times that of normal handling.
Substantial savings in handling costs are expected after existing berths are renovated and
new berths (proposed) are built. Savings in handling costs were converted to economic
benefits by shadow pricing the main cost components of normal handling and lightening.
Conversion factors of 1.05 for berth handling and 1.1 for lightening were used; these
factors were estimated in a previous Bank study.
16.   Savings in Ship Time. These include reductions in ship time waiting for berths
and working at berths, due to improved cargo handling. Estimates of savings in ship
waiting time due to the project are shown in Table 2.8. Ship costs used for the economic
evaluation were at the low end of the ship cost model developed by the Bank. The
annualized ship resale value, plus operating costs, were used to calculate project benefits.
The annual resale value of ships was assumed to reflect the present state of the shipping.
industry and gives a slightly lower return than the annualized replacement value.
17.   Savings in Cargo Time. Savings in ship cargo time also apply to the interest
saved on the value of the cargo. For domestic cargo, the marginal source of working
capital would be loans from the National Development Bank of China at 10-12 percent
interest. For foreign cargo, the higher foreign exchange working capital needed would
require more foreign borrowing, and it is assumed this would be at China's marginal cost
of capital (approximately 12 percent). Roughly 70 percent of all cargo passing through
HP involves domestic trade. Thus, interest savings were calculated assuming an average
annual interest rate of 10.0 percent.
18.   Project benefits for the items discussed above are presented by year in Table 2.8.
The major benefit would be in ship time savings. These would accrue first to shipowners
and could be passed on to cargo owners. All the ships and cargo of coal are Chinese
owned. As for general cargo, fertilizer and iron ore, the vast majority of ships visiting
the port are either Chinese-owned (COSCO) or Chinese-operated; it is expected that
90 percent of project benefits would also accrue to China directly.
E. OVERALL ECONOMIC REEVALUATION AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
19.   Table 2.9 sets out the Reevaluated Economic Rate of Return (RERR), Net Present
Value (NPV) and sensitivity calculations for the entire project. The overall RERR is
34.7 percent. Compared with the SAR and the sensitivity of RERR of the project to
variations in costs and benefits are summarized as follows:
