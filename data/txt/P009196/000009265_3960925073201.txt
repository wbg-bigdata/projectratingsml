PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA: THIRD AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2039-YU)
PREFACE
1.          The Macedonia III Agriculture Development  Project, for which Loan
2039-YU in the amount of US$80.0 K was approved on July 14, 1981, was closed
as scheduled on June 30, 1987 with a final disbursement on March 26, 1987. At
that time, the unused balance of US$21.3 M was cancelled; an additional
US$24.9 H had already been cancelled on June 28, 1985. This was the 12th Bank
loan for agriculture and agroindustries in Yugoslavia.
2.          The PCR was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Regional Office based in part on a draft PCR prepared by the Borrower
(Stopanska Banka Skopje--SBS), a review of the Staff Appraisal Report (No.
3354-YU) dated June 19, 1981, the President's Report (No. P-3100-YU), the Loan
Agreement of July 23, 1981, correspondence with the Borrower, and internal
Bank memoranda on project issues as contained in relevant Bank files.

PROJECT COMPLETiON REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA: THIRD AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2039-YU)
LVALUATION SUMMARY
1.    Project Objectives.  The main objectives were to: (i) increase
agricultural and forestry production; (ii) improve rural incomes and
employment opportunities; (iii) increase capacity utilization of
agroindustries; and (iv) assist Macedonia in developing alternative energy
sources for agriculture. All those objectives meant to accelerate economic
activity in rural Macedonia by expanding credit to individual and social
sectors for a wi-e range of agricultural activities including agroindustry and
forestry.
2. Implementation Experience. The macroeconomic conditions during project
implementation c-teriorated substantially compared to appraisal assumptions
and could not have been fully anticipated. High and accelerating domestic
inflation followed by successive Dinar devaluations resulted in significant
changes in the agricultural price structure and a drop in demand for
agricultural products. Interest rates charged to subborrowers also became
increasingly negative in real terms ar.4 it became difficult for investors to
obtain local counterpart funds. All these difficulties had a detrimental
impact on project implementation.
3.    Project Results.  The results of this project are similar to the results
of the two earlier agricultural development projects in the Republic. They
are also similar to the results of the Third Agricultural Credit Project and
some other agricultural projects in Yugoslavia. The important difference is
that iaplementation problems became more acute over time. While most of the
construction and other physical targets were achieved despite some delays
(although three irrigation schemes remain incomplete) the profitability of the
constructed facilities, particularly in the social sector, is most likely
below appraisal expectations.
4.    Project Sustainability.  Whether the project could sustain a positive
level of economic benefits in the economic environment that presently exists
in Yugoslavia is open to question. The future of most subprojects will depend
on how government policies and the Yugoslav economic situation would evolve.
It is reasonable to expect that if the government were to pursue market-
oriented policies, as is now being contemplated, most social sector
subprojects would need to be restructured.
5.    Findings and Lessons Learned.  Two lessons could be drawn out of this
project. The first is to underline the need for completing an objective
analysis of past Bank involvement and incorporating the lessons drawn from it
in the approval of new loans in the same area for similar purposes. The
second is that substantive issues such as interest rate policy need to be
resolved by action even at the cost of deferring loan approval. A
postponement of such issues not only affects project implementation and the
achievement of policy objectives in the long run, but it may also weaken the
standing of the Bank in subsequent operations and phases of policy dialogue.

B. BACKGROUND
Previous Bank Involvement
1.          The project was conceived as a follow-up on two similar
agricultural projects in Macedonia. The first was the Agricultural Industries
Project - Macedonia (Ln. 894-YU) for US$31 M approved in 1973 and closed in
1981 after a delay of 18 months. The second was the Agricultural and
Agroindustries II Project - Macedonia (Ln. 1371-YU) for US$24 M approved in
1977 and closed in 1983 after a delay of 12 months.
2.          Also, the project was to continue the support extended under the
First (Ln. 1129-YU), Second (Ln. 1477-YU), and Third (Ln. 1801-YU)
Agricultural Credit Projects, in which Macedonia participated with other
Republics and autonomous Provinces.
Sector Development Obiectives
3.         As worked out jointly with the Yugoslav and Macedonian
governments, the Bank strategy focused on agricultural development of less
developed areas of the republic by promoting growth through financing of
infrastructure development and credit to the individual and social sectors.
The key policy issues as perceived at the time included: (i) ways to increase
the productivity of the individual sector; (ii) ways to increase the about 501
capacity utilization of agroindustries financed under the two earlier
projects; and (iii) the use of subsidies and price supports as a means of
stimulating production.
4.          The viain objective of the sector was to increase agricultural
production. It was expected that the 1981-85 Macedonia Five-year Plan,
supported by the project, would lead to annual agricultural production
increases of 41, made up of rates of 5.41 and 3.41 in the social and
individual sectors respectively. This compared realistically to the actual
annual growth of 4.0X and 1.3X in the social and individual sectors between
1976 and 1980.

C. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
Project Objectives
5.          The main objectives were to: (i) increase agricultural and
forestry prodcction; (ii) improve rural incomes and employment opportunities;
(iii) increase capacity utilization of agroindustries; and (iv) assist
Macedonia in developing alternative energy sources for agriculture. All those
objectives aimed to accelerate economic activity in rural Macedonia.
6.          The means to attain these objectives included: (i) expanding
credit to individual and social sectors for a wide range of agricultural
acti-vities including agroindustry and forestry; (ii) financing infrastructure
development such as irrigation and storage; and (iii) commissioning studies on
alternative energy sources. Also, in an institution building effort, the staff
of the Stopanska Banka Skopje (SBS) was to take part in a series of seminars
to improve its ability to appraise and supervise subprojects.
Proiect Description
7.           Seven major components were included: (i) establishment of
orchards (2,500 ha) and vineyards (1,450 ha); (ii) construction of 4,000 tons
of new cold storage and expansion of three existing cold stores, (two by 4,000
tons and one by 3,000 tons); (iii) forestry plantation of 300 ha of poplar,
pilot timber extraction area with mechanized logging and 40 ha pilot fast-
growing conifer plantation, and 27 km of all-weather and 5 km of dry-weather
forest roads; (iv) construction of seven small-scale irrigation schemes to
irrigate 12,000 ha; (v) credit for the individual sector to continue support
extended under the three agricultural credit projects; (vi) construction of
pilot biogas unit to reduce oil imports; and (vii) geothermal water
development feasibility study to examine the use of thermal water as an
alternative energy source.
D. PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
8.          The general concept of the project, its  design, components and
organization were similar to those of the earlier agricultural projects (Ln.
894-YU, Ln. 1371-YU).
9.          The Bank accepted the project proposal as submitted by SBS with
minor modifications except for the construction of a wholesale market center
which was dropped on grounds of insufficient preparation. As applied elsewhere
in Yugoslavia at the time, the project design followed a standard
rural/agricultural development concept of financing investment in rural
infrastructure by extending credit to social and individual sectors. Issues
such as negative real interest rates charged to subborrowers and regulated
prices in agriculture were not raised because inflation was rather low in
Yugoslavia at that time and it was expected to remain so. Prices, even though
subject to control, were not out of line with border prices.



- 3 -
10.         The project coincided with the .981-85 Macedonia Five-year Plan.
The scope, scale and timing of the project were strongly influenced by the
perceivo'1 need to increase raw material supplies for underutilized
agroindustries financed under the two earlier projects. The expected
incremental agricultural production, part of which was intended for use by
agroindustries, is given in Table 7. The decision to increase by about 16X the
Macedonian cold storage capacity was based on expecced demand increases for
quick-frozen fruit and vegetables.
11.         The project organization relied mainly on the SBS capacity to
supervise the implementation of subprojects. All the social sector subprojects
had been identified and prepared under the Macedonia 1981-85 Five-year Plan.
Individual sector subprojects were to be aided by a special agreement among
SBS, all 24 Basic Banks (BBs) and the government to ensure better access and
timely provision of local funds, a problem which had been faced under the
earlier projects. The capability of SBS, BBs, and the investors to implement
the project was appraised by the Bank as adequate. To further strengthen the
SBS implementation capacity,a series of seminars was included to improve the
capability of its staff to appraise, process, and supervise subprojects.
12.         The roles and responsibilities of SBS, BBs, the government,
subborrowers and other agencies involved in project implementation were known
to all parties involved. Their strengths and weaknesses were also known from
the implementation experience of the tw^ earlier projects.
E. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
General
13.         The macroeconomic conditions during project implementation
deteriorated substantially compared to appraisal assumptions and could not
have been fully anticipated. High and accelerating domestic inflation followed
by successive Dinar devaluations resulted in significant changes in the
agricultural price structure and a drop in demand for agricultural products.
Interest rates charged to subborrowers also became increasingly negative in
real terms and it became difficult for investors to obtain local counterpart
funds. All these difficulties had a detrimental impact on project
implementation.
14.         The sharply deteriorating macroeconomic situation resulted in a
controversy between the Bank and SBS over the interest rate issue. With the
signing of the May 6, 1983 Letter of Development Policy (LDP) of the
Structural Adjustment Loan (Ln. 2326-YU), Yugoslav banks were to align their
interest rates with the inflation rate over a period of three to five years.
Like most other Yugoslav banks, SBS did not fully comply with the provisions
of the LDP. Further, as the commitment under the SAL appeared to represent a
statement of intent rather than a legal undertaking, it could not be
established that the failure to apply the SAL I rate to subloans under this
project constituted a default in terms of the legal documents for this
project.



- 4 -
15.         There was some doubt as to whether the interest   te provisions of
SAL I were to be applied to subloans approved prior to January 1, 1984 or to
all subloans under the project. While SBS agreed with the general principle
of adjusting on-lnding interest rates fr now credits from domestic
commercial bank s_Jrces to positive real rates over time as specified in the
LDP, it felt that credit provided through the Federal Fund for Less Developed
Regions was not subject to the LDP interest rate provisions. Although the
Bank agreed that from a legal point of view SBS was in compliance with on-
lending interest rate covenant of this project, it thought that wider economic
and financial considerations were more important. The controversy on this
issue is summarized in Appendix 1.
16.         SIS proposed a number of amendments to the Loan Agreement in May
1984 to improve disbursements and to add new subprojects with an estimated
total cost of US$47 M to utilize surplus funds resulting from the Dinar
devaluation. The Bank consideration of the amendments was delayed, pending a
resolution of the interest rate issue. In June 1985 an SIS delegation visited
Washington to finally resolve the problem. It agreed to increase the on-
lending interest rates to its sub-borrowers from 11% and, starting with 1985,
charge a variable interest rate of 30.8X for primary agricultural production
and 37.7X for other agricultural subloans on all World Bank funds on which the
foreign exchange risk was not borne by the subborrower. SIS also agreed to
increase on-lending interest rates to positive real rates over a 3-5 year
period as specified in the LDP. However, due to the mounting economic
difficulties in the country, demand for credit has fell sharply and SIS
requested a cancellation of US$25 M from the Loan.
17.         The Loan Agreement was finally amended on Oztober 24, 1985. The
increase of the disbursement percentage from 431 of total project cost to 651
and the extension of capitalization of interest and other charges from
September 1986 to March 1987 were helpful. The amendment also included new
subprojects such as new irrigation schemes, land reclamation, and geothermal
water development in the social sector, and a 30Z increase of subprojects in
the individual sector. However, none of the subprojects could be implemented
because of higher interest rates or preparation and appraisal delays.
18.         In 1984 and 1985, the rate of devaluation of the Dinar vis a vis
most Western currencies was higher than the rate of domestic inflation. Since
the Loan financed indirect foreign exchange expenditures under the project,
there was significant saving of foreign exchange compared to the appraisal
estimate. This was the main reason why only US$34 M out of the US$80 M Loan
was eventually utilized.
Project Costs
19.          Actual project costs differ substantially from appraisal
estimates (Table 6). The reasons include: (i) the lack of detailed engineering
at appraisal; (ii) 2-3 year delays in subproject start-up in an inflationary
environment; (iii) Dinar devaluation of about 1,500X between 1981 and 1987;
(iv) procurement delays; and (v) price increases between 1981 and 1987 which



were five times greater than appraisal price contingencies. The Borrower's
PCR did not provide sufficient details to determine the actual project cost.
For some of the reasons mentioned, the project was eventually implemented at a
lower cost than originally estimated.
Financing. Disbursement and Procurement
20.          Compared to the financing plan at appraisal, the Bank share of
Loan financing increased by 8.5%, while the share of SBS and that of investors
decreased by 0.2% and 8.3% respectively (Table 7). Actual amounts by
disbursement categories are entirely different from appraisal e3timates (Table
5). Disbursements lagged behind appraisal estimates and at the closing date
only US$33.8 M (43%) was disbursed (Table 3). Both IGB and LCB procurement
took more than twice as long as expected at appraisal. Also, Bank staff
devoted more time than expected in assisting SBS in procurement.
Compliance with Loan Covenants
21.         SBS generally complied with all ce-enants. The compliance with
audit covenants and the quality of audit reports has not been an issue in the
course of project implementation. The establishment of SBS Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit was delayed which delayed submissions of annual progress
reports. Also, the compliance with the dated covenant to submit t.he geothermal
feasibility study was delayed.
Proiect Comnonents
22.         While most of the construction and other physical targets of the
project were achieved despite some delays and three irrigation schemes remain
incomplete, the utilization of the constructed facilities fell well behind
appraisal expectations.
i3.         About 2,600 ha of orchards and 1,350 ha of vineyards were
established on schedule, meeting most appraisal expectations. However, as
local demand declined with reduced real consumer income and with limited
export possibilities, the incremental fruit, grapes and wine posed marketing
problems not anticipated at appraisal. Moreover, where possible, producers
preferred to bypass agroindustries in selling their produce in an effort to
obtain better prices. An attempt to design a marketing component for the
fruit, wine and vegetable produce came too late to be effective.
24.         The cold storage capacity was increased by 2,000 tans compared to
the appraisal target of 17,000 tons in four subprojects. This component
experienced a number of delays caused by the lack of local funds, ICB
procurement which took one to three years to complete, SBS requirement to
reappraise subprojects to approve cost overruns, and poor organization. While
the Gevgelia store was completed on schedule by December 1982, the three other
stores were delayed by four years. The capacity utilization of the four stores
ranges from 20-40%.



- 6 -
25.         The forestry component was reduced and modified compared to
appraisal. Only the 100 ha poplar plantation and the pilot timber extraction
area with 43 km of roads and 50 ha of conifer were established. Problems
encountered included lack of good quality planting material and land
acquisition.
26.         Of the seven proposed small scale irrigation schemes, five were
approved to irrigate 11,100 ha. They were completed with delays and cost
overruns caused by problems such as inadequate geological investigations, poor
engineering preparation, LCB procurement management, inflation, and real cost
increases of construction materials. While the Tetovo-Bistrica scheme
(appraisal/actual -3,700/3,500 ha) and the Gostivar scheme (4,500/4,500 ha)
were completed and are fully operational, Kicevo (1,200/650 ha), Berevo
(900/350 ha), Mezdra/Sv. Nikole (1,000/260 ha) remain incomplete. Although
project appraisal relied on well-advanced feasibility studies, major design
and other changes have taken place in all schemes during implementation. For
example, the total project cost of the Mezdra/Sv. Nikole increased from
US$6.3 M at appraisal to US$12.0 M. Although the revised feasibility study
contained serious errors and omissions, the scheme was finally approved in
October 1982 after further SBS clarifications. The Bank requested and received
a copy of a revised spillway design. However, spillway design problems pointed
out during scheme appraisal were not taken fully into account and spillway
crest and floor were damaged in April 1984 due to the absence of a deep
diaphragm wall originally provided in the design but omitted in construction.
The other four schemes had similar problems. SBS, with Bank encouragement,
proposed five new irrigation schemes in June 1984 to utilize credit cost
savings due to Dinar devaluation. However, the feasibility reports for these
subprojects were submitted with serious technical deficiencies and too late
(January 1986) to be revised, and the subprojects could not be implemented.
27.         The individual sector credit component continued the support
extended under the three agricultural credit projects, with similar results.
The recently completed Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) for the Third
Agricultural Credit Project (Ln. 1801-YU) is directly applicable to this
component, as it was implemented in parallel. In summary, the PPAR findings
applicable here include: (i) delays caused by the need to identify subprojects
and complete feasibility studies; (ii) difficulties in reaching consensus on
priorities; (iii) shortage of local funds in BBs and investor capital despite
the special agreement among implementing agencies at the time of project
preparation; (iv) significant differences between appraisal projections and
actual investments; and (v) need to reappraise some subprojects due to cost
overruns resulting from domestic inflation. Aithough this component was
amended to include 4,000 families, only 3,000 families participated, as
expected at appraisal. Higher interest rates and deteriorating profitability
discouraged participation after the Loan Agreement was amended on October 24,
1985.
28.         The plan to construct a pilot biogas unit at Belcevo to explore
alternative sources of energy for agriculture was abandoned due to the lack of
investor interest.

29.         The first phase of the geothermal water development feasibility
study at Kocani was completed with a two-year delay in January 1986. The
second phase of the study was not initiated due the to lack of investor
interest.
F. PROJECT RESULTS
30.         The results of this project are similar to the results of the two
earlier agricultural development projects in the Republic. They are also
similar to the results of the Third Agricultural Credit Project and some other
agricultural projects in Yugoslavia. The important difference is that
implementation problems became more acute over time.
31.         As under the two earlier projects, while most of the construction
and other physical targets were achieved despite some delays (although three
irrigation schemes remain incomplete) the profitability of the constructed
facilities, particularly in the social sector, is most likely below appraisal
expectations. However, the Borrower's PCR did not provide sufficient data to
determine the profitability of project investments.
Agricultural ImRact
32.         The demand for fresh and processed agricultural produce declined
as a result of the worsening economic situation in the country. Information
on incremental production and yields remains incomplete due to the wide range
of subprojects financed and the limitations of the monitoring and evaluation
system. A revised estimate of the project's annual incremental production in
the individual sector and a list of individual sector subprojects are based on
SBS data (Table 5). However, it is not clear how much of the incremental
production is delivered to agroindustries in Macedonia for further processing.
Judged by the 20-40% utilization of the cold stores established under the
project and similar rates for most other agroindustrial establishments
financed under the two earlier projects, it appears that their financial
viability is questionable. The completed irrigation schemes are utilized and
water charges collected, although information on crops grown and their
profitability is not available.
Financial and Economic Impact
33.         Although the information needed to estimate financial and economic
rates of return is incomplete, estimates from other similar projects in
Yugoslavia and the SAR sensitivity analysis were used for comparison. The SAR
economic rate of return for the whole project was 16.8% and the economic and
financial rates ranged from 6% to 42%. The PCR economic rate of return for
the whole project is estimated at 9% and the economic and financial rates
range from 2% to 20% (Table 9). The actual rates of return for social sector
investments in cold storage might be lower than estimated at appraisal mainly
due to the relatively low present capacity utilization. It is possible,
however, that benefits resulting from investments in irrigation may reach the
appraisal estimate in the three out of five cases where the irrigation
infrastructure was completed.

G. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
34.         Whether the project could sustain a positive level of economic
benefits in the economic environment that presently exists in Yugoslavia is
open to question.  The f&ure of most subprojects will depend on how
government policies and the Yugoslav economic situation would evolve. It is
reasonable to expect that if the government were to pursue market-oriented
policies, as is now being contemplated, most social sector subprojects would
need to be restructured.
H. BANK PERFORMANCE
35.         Although the severe deterioration of the macroeconomic situation
could not have been anticipated at appraisal, the Bank should have been more
effective in analyzing the experience of its earlier involvement in Macedonia
and elsewhere in Yugoslavia and drawn clear conclusions from it prior to
approving this project.
36.         The Bank's general acquiescence in Yugoslav agricultural
development policy which relied on subsidized credit brought about a portfolio
of problem projects. The Bank kept pointing to the need for positive on-
lending interest rates from the mid 1970s. While the Bank initiated two
interest rate studies (1976, 1980) stipulating that their results would be
applied under ongoing projects, lending to subprojects at increasingly
negative real rates continued. Agreement on the issue with the federal
government was reached only in May 1983 and with SBS more than two years
later.
37.         The manner in which the interest rate issue was dealt with also
received comment in the PCR of Ln. 894-YU. In its evaluation of SBS
performance, it stated as follows: "a strict allocation of resources or making
capital more expensive might induce investors to take more rational economic
decisions. The Bank has already taken some concrete action in this direction.
For example, under Ln. 1477-YU, it required the Borrower to undertake an
interest rate study which has resulted in change of thinking about the rate of
interest in a socialist country." (page 41, Report No. 449).
38.         The Bank accepted the SBS project concept which focused on the
perceived need to increase primary production and availability of raw
materials for agroindustries financed under the two earlier projects.
However, in retrospect, it became obvious that most of the agroindustrial
subprojects were overdesigned and that poor management, marketing and weak
demand were the reasons for their poor performance. The reasons for weak
product demand included: (i) declining real consumer income; (ii) limited
export possibilities; and (iii) uncoordinated expansion of agroindustrial
processing capacity elsewhere in Yugoslavia.
39.         About 400 Bank staff weeks were spent on the project, of which 50X
was spent on preparation/preappraisal, 22% on appraisal, 4% on negotiations,
and 24% on supervision. It is not clear from project documents why and how so
much of Bank time was used to prepare the project. Some of this time might
have been used to analyze earlier experience, draw conclusions, and identify



- 9 -
conditionality for subsequent involvement (e.g. interest rate and price
policy, need for detailed engineering designs prior to appraisal, etc.), but
whether such deliberation took place, is not clear in the written record of
project formulation. Project supervision suffered by frequent changes of task
managers.
40.         Two lessons come out of this review.  The first is to underline
the need for completing an objective analysis of past Bank involvement and
incorporating the lessons drawn from it in the approval of new loans in the
same area for similar purposes. The second is that substantive issues such as
interest rate policy need to be resolved by action even at the cost of
deferring loan approval. A postponement of such issues not only affects
project implementation and the achievement of policy objectives in the long
run, but it may also weaken the standing of the BanK in subsequent operations
and Dhases of policy dialogue.
I. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
41.         SBS repeated its performance under the earlier projects which
reflected the weaknesses of the Yugoslav banking system. Although SBS, like
other Yugoslav banks, carries out banking functions with considerable
autonomy, its decisions are strongly influenced by the social sector
organizations which are in effect both its owners and major borrowers.
Moreover, about 75% of all government funds for economic development are
channelled through SBS, giving an advantage to its major borrowers in
obtaining subsidized credit. These and other weaknesses of the Yugoslav
banking system are now being recognized and addressed as part of the overall
economic and financial reform.
42.         SBS in its comments on the two earlier projects indicated the need
for more efficient appraisal, approval and supervision of subprojects.
However, a series of seminars designed for the purpose did not prove effective
and deficiencies identified during earlier projects and recognized at
appraisal have not been eliminated in the course of project implementation.
Hopefully, SBS would become a more efficient institution once fundamental
changes contemplated under the new banking law are implemented.
J. PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
43.         As already mentioned, the SAR and the Loan Agreement followed the
standards of other Yugoslav agricultural projects. Because of numerous changes
during project implementation, the value of the SAR for project implementation
was limited.
44.         The draft PCR, prepared by the Depar-ment of Investment Operations
in Agroindustries and Forestry, SBS, is more descriptive than analytical. Most
of the key issues relevant to future projects such as SBS interest rate policy
or specific elements of the banking reform that would make SBS operate like a
bank are not discussed. No doubt, SBS as other Yugoslav banks, faces a tough
future managing a portfolio of financially-troubled companies.

Project ComDietion Report
Interest Rate Controversy
After signing of the Letter of Development Policy (LDP) of the
Structural Adjustment Loan (Ln. 2326-YU) Bank supervision missions came to be
concerned that the interest rate charged on the proceeds of the above Loan on-
lent to individual subborrowers was less than the rate which the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) proposed to introduce in connection with
Loan No. 2326-YU ("SAL I rate").1' This note deals with the issue of whether
or not the Borrower and the Guarantor could be considered to be in compliance
with the covenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements.
Loan Agreement
The Project consisted, inter alia, of a program of subloans made by
Stopanska Banka Skopje (SBS) to individual farmers for on-farm investments21
and to social sector organizations for a variety of investments. The subloans
were made from three sources of funds: the Loan, federal or regional
development funds and other resources of the Borrower. Under the Loan
Agreement, interest to be charged on the principal amount of subloans
outstanding varies depending on the sub-borrower, tze type of investment
project and the source of funds. In the case of su--loans to individual
farmers, the rates were as follows:  (a) Bank funds   at least 111 per annum;
'b) development funds: no requirement; and (c) oth-r resources: at least 10l
per annum. A uniform rate on the total principal outstanding of each subloan
to an individual farmer (consisting of the weighted average of the rates
described in (a) and (c) above) was to be aplied3/ (Loan Agreement, Schedule
5, Section 3(B)).
1/     For calendar 1984, this rate was 26X per annum.  See footnote 8.
2/     For example, subloans for fruit, vegetables, dairy, livestock and
tobacco production and for on-farm mechanization.
3/     In the case of subloans to social sector organizations, the rates
are:  Bank loan:  at least 10.10  or 11% depending on the
investment; development funds: no requirement; other resources:
at least 10%.

Appendix I
Page 2 of 15
According to a letter from SBS dated December 14, 1984, Banks are
obligated to charge "active interest rates" on those funds lent to the ci--:z;:
and OALs from the economy.  Loans for "agricultural purposes in the indivitual
sector" have a rate of 25.5X per annum.  Other sources of funds, including
development funds and the world Bank Loan, are on-lent at "passive interest
rates" plus a spread; the rate amounts to 12.5% per annum.41 Although it was
not clear from this letter what rate was being charged on Bank funds on-lent to
ind.1viduals, it appeared that the rate complied with the requirements of the
Loan Agreement but was lower than the SAL I rate.
In a letter of May 6, 1983 sent by the Federal Secretariat for Finance of
the SFRY to the Bank in fulfillment of a condition of presentation of Loans No.
2306-YU (Kosovo Regional Development Project) and 2307-YU (Serbia Regional
Development Project) to the Board (Annex 2), the Federal Secretary for Finance
stated "the intent of the SFRY Government to take indispensable measures as to
ensure that interest rates charged on loans to the agricultural sector (for
basic primary agricultural production51 and exports made out of domestic
resources of Yugoslav banks excluding development funds) are adjusted gradually
and periodically in order to attain real interest rates.. .over the next five
years.6/ The letter also stated that the Government intended to make the first
adjustment on January 1, 1984. This new rate was to apply to
all loans in the agricultural sector, approved after January 1, 1984.
Subsequent adjustment would apply to all disbursed and outstanding amounts of
credits approved after this date. Finally, the letter stated that interest
rates "on loans to the individual agricultural sector made out of the Bank's
funds will also be increased as above..."
In the LDP dated May 25, 1983 furnished to the Bank in connection with
Loan No. 2326-YU (Structural Adjustment Loan), the Secretary for Finance
stated that "there is a firm intention of gradual attainment of real interest
rates over several years through, primarily, reducing inflation rates and
gradually adjusting the nominal interest rates to these trends... In the coming
years, ... it is proposed to introduce a floor lending rate for new credits
from domestic commercial bank resources.71 This floor interest rate should be
introduced as of January 1, 1984." A formula for annually adjusting,these
4/     It was unclear whether this was the overall blended rate and what
rates were being charged on the principal of subloans to social
sector organizations. On the Bank Loan proceeds and development
funds it was a "passive rate" plus a spread; on other sources it
was an active rate.
5/     Defined as production of cereals, milk, meat industrial crops and
"conditions for significantly increasing their production."
6/     The rates for other loans in the agricultural sector were to be
increased over 3 vears.
7/     This term was not defined.

rates on the basis of inflation was set forth in the lecter.  The formula
varied depending on the seccor for which the credit was made.8' The formula
was made applicable to World Bank funds on-lent to individual farmers in
agriculture sector by a telex of May 12, 1983 (Annex 4) in which   the Federal
Secretary for Finance confirmed that "for the purpose of decerminir.g....the
interest rates in (the May 6, 19831 letter, we will apply the procedures and
indices for measuring inflation set forth in the LDP."
In summary, on the issue of Bank funds on-lent to individual farmers fot
primary agricultural production, the Guarantor represented to the Bank that i:
intended to take measures to ensure that interest rates charged on all such
loans approved after January 1, 1984, would be set and revised periodically in
accordance with the procedures and indices described in the LDP. This
representation applied to the proceeds of Loan 2039-YJ on-lent to individual
farmers under subloans approved subsequent to January 1, 1984. The
representation did not seem to apply necessarily to subloans approved prior to
January 1, 1984, even if disbursements thereunder were still continuing.
Thus, for the Bank funded portion of such subloans approved after January 1,
1984, SFRY intended that a variable interest rate apply, with annual
adjustments made in accordance with the LDP.
The correspondence between the Bank and the Government appears to
consist of a statement of intent rather than a legal undertaking. The Federal
Secretary stated that it was the intent of the Government to take the measures
necessary to ensure that the specified rates and ad4ustments on agriculture
loans are applied. Secondly, the Guarantee Agreement for Loan 2039-YU
contained no specific undertaking regarding current or future interest rates.
While the representation in the subsequent correspondence formed a
precondition for the Bank's agreement to nirke Loans 2306-YU and 2307-YU
neither was it a precondition for, nor was it contemplated by Loan 2039-YU.
It was difficult, in the circumstances, to establish conclusively that either
SBS or SFRY has defaulted in its obligations under the Loan or Guarantee
Agreement for Loan No. 2037-YU on the basis that the interest rate currently
charged on Bank funds on-lent to individual farmers is less than the SAL I
rate.
8/     In the case of primary agricultural production, the floor, as of
January 1, 1"' was set at 18X plus 1/5 of the difference between
18X and 19r    'ation measured by the index of producer prices.

Discussion
The above correspondence did not, by itself, obligate SBS to increase
the individual interest rates charged on Bank funds above the levels
covenanted in the Loan Agreement for Loan No. 2039-YU (paragraph 2 above).
The representations included in these letters were made by the Federal
Government; no representation was made by SBS."0/
The interpretation that this correspondence required SFRY to ensure that
the SAL I rate be applied to the subloans descxibed in paragraph 6 above poses
problems for two reasons:
(a)   The correspondence, when read together, appears to consist of a
statement of intent rather than a legal undertaking. The Federal
Secretary stated that it is the intent of the Government to take
the measures necessary to ensure that the specified rates and
adjustments on agriculture loans are applied. This view is
supported by the Minutes of Negotiations for Loan No. 2307-YU
which, in describing how the interest rate adjustment described in
the then draft of the May 6, 1983 letter, would apply to the
Project being negotiated stated that the adjustment described in
the "letter of intent" will apply throuah a supplemental letter.
The Minutes also record the Bank's requirement that this "letter
of intent" be signed as a condition of Ooard presentation.
(b)   The Guarantee Agrement for Loan 2039-YU -ontains no specific
undertaking regarding current or future interest rates. While the
representation in the subsequent correspondence formed a
precondition for the Bank's agrement to make Loans No. 2306-YU and
2307-YU, neither was it a precondition for not was it contemplated
by Loan 2039-YU. It could not therefore be viewed as an
undertaking under that Loan. Thus, even if failure to ensure the
application of the SAL I rate could constitute a default under the
Loan or Guarantee Agreement for Loan No. 2307-YU,"1/ it would not
constitute a default under the Guarantee Agreement for Loan No.

applied. Even if, as a result of a failure to apply the SAL I

sector negotiated after Loan No. 2307-YU, that the borrowing bank undertake,
inter alia, to adjust the interest rate charged Bank funds on-lent to
individual sub borrowers for primary production in accordance with the LDP.

included as covenants in the Project Agreement.

rate the Bank could and did exercise its remedy of suspersion or
disbursements under another Loan, the Bank could not then suspend
disbursements under this Loan unless the Borrower f that o--.er
Loan were SBS or the Guarantor. (See General Conditions, Section.
6.02(d)). For the reasons described above, it is difficult to
argue that either SBS or SFRY has defaulted in its obligations
under the Loan or Guarantee Agreement for Loan No. 2037-YU on the
ground that the interest rate currently charged on Bank funds on-
lent to individual farmers is less than the SAL I rate.

Dear Mr.Harris;
In the period from December 7 to 10,4384,as you know,your
mission headed by Mr.Pranich,the ass'stant director of
A.iA,was in Xacedonia to review the implementation of
projects financed by loans from your 3ank.
aesides other issues negotiated,the s.ibject of consideration
was also tne interest policy in agriculture,accepted under
SAL I oy Yu&cslavia.
The mission stated that our Bank did not observe the new
interest policy accepted under SAL I for the Loan funds aimed
to investments in3ind      l AA~rr.Namely,the funds were
approved with an interest rate of 12.51 in stead of 25.5%,
annually.
In respect to this comment,besides oral explanation given
during negotiations,we were required to submit your bank a
written one,as well,which is as follows:in accordance with
SAL I,and in order to reduce tne inflation rate,a new interest
policy was agreed to be applied in Yugoslavia on the Funds
from banking sources deriving from deposit savings of tne

Interest Rate Policy
During the past year, the interest rate mechanism has been actively used
in support of our adjustment efforts. Since March 1982, nominal deposit
interest rates have been raised on three occasions. The most recent increase
occurred in February 1983, with the result that the lending rates on
commercial bank credits from their own resources have risen significantly.
Although new lending rates vary significantly according to the particular
circumstances of each bank, lending rates for non-priority purposes, and in
some instances even priority projects, are approaching or have reached real
levels. However, despite these increases in nominal interest rates, owing to
the continued relatively high rate of inflation in Yugoslavia, average lending
rates on commercial bank resources and more especially on selective credits
and special funds have remained negative in real terms. There is a firm
intention of gradual attainment of real interest rates over several years
through, primarily, reducing inflation rates and gradually adjusting the
nominal interest rates to these trends, in conformity with the long-term
orientation of the Anti-inflation Program.
The most recent increase in borrowing interest rates, effected in
February this year, was based on our assumptions of likely annual growth in
producers prices. In accordance with the objectives of the medium-term policy
and determination to gradually adjust the interest rates to the rate of
inflation, if the information shows that producers prices rise at a rate of
growth faster than the planned one, we shall review the need to adjust
interest rates to such trends.
As concerns the interest rate policy in the coming years providing for
the adjustment of interest rates in line with the movements in inflation, it
is proposed to introduce a floor lending rate for new credits from domestic
commercial bank resources. This floor interest rate would be introduced as of
January 1,1984 and would initially amount to 18%. Should inflation in 1983
(January 1 to December 31, 1983) be higher than anticipated, this initial
interest rate would be increased by at least one-third of the difference
between the initial floor rate (18%) and the rate of inflation in 1983 (as
measured by the index of producers prices). The process of adjustment of
interest rates resulting in the attainment of real interest rates would be
concluded in 1986. In the course of this period, real interest rates should
be gradually introduced, namely:
-     For economic sectors, in January 1985 the floor interest rate
would be increased by at least one-third of the difference between
the growth of producers prices and the floor interest rate set for
1984. However, if in 1984 the rate of growth of retail prices
should exceed the growth of producers prices, the floor interest
rate for 1985 would be increased by an additional amount equal to
at least one-third of the difference between the increase in the
index of producers prices and the index of retail prices. The
same formula would be applied for setting the floor interest rate
in 1986.  In January 1987 the floor interest rate would be



- 41 -
Appendix I
Page 13 of 15
adjusted in accordance with the index of producers prices for
1986, unless the rate of increase of retail prices in 1986 was
higher than that of producers prices, in which case the floor
interest rate would be at least equal to the level of the increase
of retail prices in 1986.
For non-economic sectors, starting in January 1984, floor interest
rates would be adjusted annually in the course of the following
two years so that by January 1986 they reach the level equal to at
least the rate of inflation measured by the index of retail prices
for 1985.
-   In the above context, exceptions would be made where interest rates
would also be increased in accordance with this adjustment but not with the
same intensity and time frames, because of the selective financing which is
the function of the implementation of the policy of economic stabilization in
accordance with the medium-term development plan of the country, namely:
(a)   all export credits;
(b)   all short-term credits for agriculture approved within the
framework of the selective credit policy of the Yugoslav National
Bank;
(c)   investment credits for primary agricultural production (cereals,
milk, meat, industrial crops and conditions for significantly
increasing their production, that is large irrigation and drainage
works, land consolidation and bringing new land under
cultivation); for other agricultural investments including
agroindusty the provisions of paragraph 27 shall apply;
(d)   investment credits for other priority activities which will be
defined and identified in the Amendments to the Social Plan of
Yugoslavia for the 1981 - 1985 period.
(e)   resources paid into the special funds for accelerated development
of less developed regions at the level of the Federation,
Republics and Autonomous Provinces, as well as resources
associated in the form of joint ventures in accordance with the
existing system of stimulating the development of these regions.
The total volume of investment credits in fixed assets approved by domestic
banks under items (c), (d) and (e) will not in any given year, through 1985,
exceed 25X of the revise volume of annual total investments in fixed assets in
the social sector in the 1983 - 1985 period. In January 1986, most favorable
interest rates on investment credits for fixed assets for these purposes can
be applied to not more than 25X of the total investment credits of domestic
banks for fixed assets in the social sector. The floor interest rate for
credits under item (c) will, as of January 1984, amount to 18X and the



- 42 -
Appendix 1
Page 14 of 15
inflation in 1983 measured by the index of producers prices. In January 1985
the floor interest rate would be increased by at least one-fifth of the
difference between the growth of producers prices and the floor interest rate
set for 1984. However, if in 1984 the rate of growth of retail prices should
exceed the growth of producers prices and the floor interest rate set for
1984. However, if in 1984 the rate of growth of retail prices should exceed
the growth of producers prices, the floor interest rate for 1985 would be
increased by an additional amount equal to at least one-fifth of the deference
between the increase in the index of producers prices and the index of retail
prices. The same formula would be applied for setting the floor interest rate
in 1986, 1987 and 1988. In January 1989 the floor interest rate would be
adjusted in accordance with the index of producers prices for 1988, unless the
rate would be at least equal to the level of the increase of retail prices in
1988.  We intend each year gradually to   adjust interest rates on credits
under items (d) above in such a way as to reach the level of real interest
rates over a five year period starting on January 1, 1984 with the proviso
that the floor interest rate for these credits, in January 1984, will not be
less than the average rate of reproductive ability of the economy of the
country (i.e. the ratio between amortization and accumulation and average use
of business funds). In January 1985 the floor interest rate would be
increased by at least one-fourth of the difference between the growth of
producers prices and the floor interest rate set for 1984. However, if in
1984 the rate of growth of retail prices should exceed the growth of producers
prices, the floor interest rate for 1985 will be increased by an additional
amount equal to at least one-fourth of the difference between the increase in
the index of producers prices and the index of retail prices. The same
formula would be applied for setting the floor interest rate in 1986, 1987 and
1988. In January 1989 the floor interest rate would be adjusted in accordance
with the index of producers prices for 1988, unless the rate of increase of
retail prices in 1988 was higher than that of producers prices for 1988,
unless the rate of increase of retail prices in 1988 was higher than that of
producers prices, in which case the floor interest rate would be at least
equal to the level of the increase of retail prices in 1988.
The intention of the policy is to eliminate the difference between the
rate of inflation and the floor interest rate within the stated period by
appropriately increasing interest rates to reduce the gap between the two in
each successive year. Similarly, should there be a reduction in the rate of
inflation which was used as the basis for adjusting interest rates, interest
rates would be revised downwards accordingly. This means in the event that
the rate of increase in retail prices in any year should be lower than the
floor interest rate in that year, then the floor interest rate would be
revised downwards so that the floor rate of interest cannot be lower than the
rate of increase in retail prices.
In accordance with our medium-term development policy and with the
system of stimulating accelerated development of economically less developed
republics and the SAP Kosovo, as well as other less developed regions, and in
accordance with the policy of interest rates proposed above, an appropriate



- 43 -                           Appendix I
Page 15 of 15
policy of differentiated interest rates would be developed for all resources
channelled to these regions through development funds. The reason for this
being that there are solidarity resources targeted for a more harmonious
development of the country and the reduction of differences between more and
less economically developed regions in Yugoslavia. Another reason is that 50%
of these resources are in the form of the association of resources between
those providing and those using resources, which means that they jointly bear
risks, effect the transfer of experience, bring about technological and
organizational improvement and jointly generate income. The policy of
economic stabilization envisages an increasing share of resources associated
in this manner as compared with resources provided on the basis of obligatory
loans.
Our existing regulations enable the introduction of variable borrowing
and lending rates, so that the banks may provide for the application of such
interest rates in their credit agreements.
