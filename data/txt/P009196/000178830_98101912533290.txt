MACEDONIA III - AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
I. THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR
A. Project Background
1.00     The Socialist Republic of Macedonia (SRM) is located in southern
Yugoslavia (IBRD Map 15449). It has a total land surface of 2.57 million
ha (10% of Yugoslavia) and a population of 1.9 million (8.5% of Yugoslavia).
Along with Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro and the Province of Kosovo, SRM
is one of Yugoslavia's least developed regions; 1979 per capita income was
about US$1,654, 68% of the national average. 1/ The proposed project would
follow two earlier projects for agricultural and agroindustrial development
in SRM: the Agricultural Industries Project - Macedonia (Loan 894-YU,
1973) and the Agricultural and Agroindustries II Project - Macedonia
(Loan 1371-YU, 1977). It would also continue, and be supportive of,
investments made under the First (Loan 1129-YU), Second (Loan 1477-YU), and
Third (Loan 1801-YU) Agricultural Credit Projects, in which SRM has
participated along with other Republics and autonomous Provinces.
1.01     A Bank mission identified the Project in October 1979 and
Stopanska Bank, Skopje (SBS), the borrower under previously Bank financed
projects in Macedonia and one of eight participating banks under the Agri-
cultural Credit Projects, prepared it. A June 1980 pre-appraisal mission
was followed by appraisal from September 29 through October 17, 1980. The
appraisal mission consisted of Messrs. V.A. Ashworth (mission leader),
T. Guma (Bank), and D.M. O'Connor, C. Holloway, and G.Y. Weinschenck (Con-
sultants); E.P. Schertz, J. Srivastava (Bank) V. Patankar, and J. LaRue
(Consultants) appraised specific components in June 1980; Ms. A. Trzeciak
and Mr. F. Wright (Bank) assisted in project analyses in Washington.
Mr. P. Harrison (Consultant) assisted with the economic analysis and
reviewed the export markets for specific commodities through a desk study
in Washington.
B. Agriculture in Yugoslavia
1.02     Agriculture development in the Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (SFRY) is crucial to: (1) meeting an about 4% annual increase
in domestic consumption; (2) increasing exports and foreign exchange
earnings; (3) meeting the expanding demand for agroindustrial raw

materials; (4) increasing rural employment; and (5) meeting income objec-
tives, especially in the individual sector.
1.03     Yugoslavia's land surface is about 25.6 million hectares, of which
about 56% is arable (Table 2, page 6). Of this total, about half is under
agriculture. Currently, about 70% of arable land is held by 36% of the
population (22.2 million total) in both social and individual farm
sectors. Out of Yugoslavia's labor force of about 8.9 million, about 26%
(1979 estimate) are employed in agriculture. In 1978, the agricultural
sector accounted for about 15% of GNP (19% in 1971); and about 11% of total
commodity exports (34% in 1961). This downward trend in agriculture's con-
tribution to the economy is due mainly to accelerated growth in the indus-
trial sector. In relative terms the active labor force, export commodi-
ties, and investment, in the agricultural sector show similar trends.
However, agricultural production has been increasing on average by 4-5% per
year. Trends in agricultural sector key indicators are given in Table 1.

Agriculture is the only sector of the economy which is predominantly pri-
vately owned; about 84% of the country's arable land belongs to an esti-
mated 2.2 million individual farmers (average size of holdings, 3.5 ha),
who constitute about 58% of the agricultural labor force. The individual
sector exists side by side with social sector agro-kombinats which hold
about 16% of the arable land and produce about 28% of the nation's agri-
cultural output, which position reflects the better land, more irrigation,
modern technology, and greater capital used in the social sector.
1.04     In the past, Yugoslavia's agricultural development strategy has
been to promote growth of social sector agriculture as the principal means
to achieve large scale market production and self-sufficiency in food. The
agro-kombinats which comprise the social sector, are vertically integrated
enterprises engaged in production, processing, distribution and marketing
of agricultural commodities. They consist of Basic Organizations of Asso-
ciated Labor (BOAL), which specialize in self-contained production pro-
cesses such as grape production, wine-making, and marketing. Two or more
BOALs in similarly linked activities, join to make up a work organization
(WO). Two or more WOs join to make a Composite Organization of Associated
Labor (COAL); the total organization is called in the agricultural sector
an Agro-Kombinat: (AIK).
1.05     Individual sector development is sought through long-term associa-
tion of individual farmers into Basic Cooperative Organizations (BCO) 1/
associated with AIKs. The BCOs give farmers a number of advantages includ-
ing: retention of individual land titles; assured markets and access to
AIK technical know-how; access to credit and inputs; participation in
social sector health and pension schemes; and participation in the decision
making process for AIK development programs which directly affect the
individual's welfare. Disadvantages to the individual include some loss
of flexibility and, in many cases, lower product prices paid by the BCO.
Because they make allowances for BCO operating and overhead costs, which in
many cases could be higher than necessary, product prices paid to indi-
vidual producers are in some cases too low. Prices however, are usually
announced in advance of the new growing season and individuals are not
compelled to contract with BCOs and AIKs. Since its inception in 1974,
encouraging restults have been achieved in cooperation between the two
sectors. During 1973-78 for example, the area under major crops (wheat,
maize, sugar beet) grown by cooperating farmers increased by 37%, and the
1/ BCO is used to denote different forms of Basic Organizations which
cooperate with individual farmers under the Law of Associated Labor.
These forms range from BCOs made up entirely of individual farmers, to
varying degrees of mix between individual farmers and the social sector
and are referred to variously as Basic Cooperative Organizations, Basic
Organizations of contract farmers, Basic Organizations of Cooperants,
BOAL for cooperation with individual sector, and Zadruga.

number of individual farmers engaged in livestock production on a long-term
cooperation basis, by 60%. It remains uncertain, however, whether the
system will achieve the national goal of rapidly modernizing individual
sector agriculture. Despite the progress made so far, individual farmers
generally continue a cautious approach to full integration with the social
sector.
1.06     Yugoslavia's draft agricultural development plan (1981-85) aims at
an annual 4% production growth; the social sector is expected to grow at
6%; the individual sector, 4%. Agroindustries, a priority activity, are
expected to grow by 7% annually. The plan's strategy is based on continued
development of social sector holdings and increased cooperation with the
individual farm sector. The slower growth targeted for the individual sec-
tor reflects its limited absorptive capacity and the difficulties in pro-
viding large numbers of small farmers with appropriate inputs and markets.
It also suggests that the basic issues of how to promote rapid moderniza-
tion of the individual agricultural sector have still not been resolved.
C. Bank Strategy In Yugoslavia's Agricultural Sector
1.07     The Bank's lending strategy is consistent with Yugoslavia's agri-
cultural development policy. The Bank assisted in formulating the 1973
"Green Plan", a comprehensive framework for agricultural development, which
stressed the need to support the individual farm sector to accelerate agri-
cultural growth. About 50% of the World Bank lending program to Yugoslavia
over the next several years is expected to be in the agricultural sector.
The Bank's strategy focuses on development of less developed regions and
promoting growth, in both the individual and social sectors, by providing
basic infrastructure and credit. The Bank stresses the growth of indi-
vidual sector primary production, and of social sector agro-industries
which provide outlets for individual sector production. This strategy is
based on; (a) the individual sector's comparative advantage and potential
in labor intensive production such as livestock, fruits and vegetables; and
(b) the need to stress rural individual sector growth to improve income
distribution, alleviate pockets of relative poverty, increase productivity,
reduce unbalanced rural-urban migration, and raise incomes. The Bank, how-
ever, also recognizes that social sector investments stimulate and comple-
ment individual sector development, especially in irrigation, agroindustry,
cold storage, marketing and distribution.  Social sector primary production
investments also play an important role in the overall development of the
sector, particularly in Macedonia.
1.08     The proposed project would be the 12th Bank loan for agriculture
and agroindustries in Yugoslavia and would be consistent with the develop-
ment strategy of Yugoslavia, Macedonia and the Bank.  As only one previous
project has been completed, no project completion or performance audit
re.ports have been issued although a project completion report for the First
Macedonia Agro-Industry Project is under preparation.

D. The Agricultural Sector and Development Issues in Macedonia 1/
Background
1.09     Agriculture contributes about 18% of Macedonia's GNP and absorbs
44% of the active working population; the active agricultural labor force,
however, continues to decline by 1.5% annually. Although it remains an
important sector, agriculture has, due to rapid industrial growth, been
declining relative to the rest of the economy. Between 1966 and 1977,
agricultural production expanded at an annual rate of 4%. Fruit and vege-
table production grew most rapidly, encouraged by rising relative prices
and increased use of modern technology and irrigation, especially in the
social sector. Production growth in the social sector, combined with
decreased labor input, resulted in an annual labor productivity increase
(1966-78) of 4.5%. In 1977-78, agriculture in SRM grew by 2.1% compared to
2.3% in SFRY. The Macedonian social sector grew by an average of 4% com-
pared to the individual sector's 1.3%; growth rates were below the antici-
pated Plan rates of 8% in the social sector and 3% in the individual
sector. Key socio-economic indicators for Macedonia compared to those for
SFRY are given in Table 2.

cultural sector, see IBRD report 1223-YU; 'The Economy of the Socialist
Republic of Macedonia' (3 volumes), June 28, 1976.

Social Sector and Individual Sector Differences
Productivity and Yields
1.10     Productivity and income disparities between the social sector and
the individual sector, are a major problem in Macedonia's rural economy.
Individual sector productivity is lower than in the social sector; and the
gap continues to increase. Table 3 compares average yields obtained in the
two sectors. This disparity is primarily a result of higher investment,
greater use of modern technology, better availability of skilled manpower,
and possession of better quality and irrigated land in the social sector.

Source: Statistical Yearbook of Yugoslavia.
Other causes of comparatively low individual sector productivity and yields
are, inter alia: (a) small fragmented holdings which make modernization
through investment more difficult; and (b) comparatively higher social
sector incomes which attract active individuals to become 'mixed' operators
(deriving income from both sectors) who then see farming as only a part-
time occupation, from which they have no need to maximize productivity and
income.
Contribution to the Economy
1.11     In 1978, the agricultural social sector held about 27% of Mace-
donia's cultivated land, employed 9.2% of the agricultural labor force,
produced 31% of the agricultural product, and contributed 45% to SRM's
marketed agriculture production. Compared to SFRY as a whole (para 1.03),
the social sector is more important in the SRM agricultural sector. Social
sector agriculture recorded an average production growth of about 9%
annually between 1965 and 1975, about triple the individual sector's. In
1978, there were 168 legal organizations in the social sector with an
average area of cultivatable soil of 1150 ha, most of which was irrigated.



- 8 -
1.12     In comparison (1978), the individual sector owned about 73% of the
total cultivable land, employed 33% of the total active population but
produced only 69% of agricultural output and contributed 55% of marketed
production. Productivity is centered on about 161,000 individual farms
with an average cultivable area of about 3 ha, usually in at least 4
fragments. The maximum arable area which an individual can own is 10 ha.
About 40% of individual holdings are less than 2 ha, 29% are between 2 and
5 ha, and 14% exceed 5 ha (Annex 3, Table T-8). Individual sector labor
productivity is also significantly lower than that of the social sector.
The individual sector, however, produces 80% of SRM vegetable output, 97%
of tobacco, 74% of milk, 85% of meat, 87% of wool, 50% of grapes, and 64%
of fruits, though the social product per ha of cultivable soil amounts to
only about 54% of that of the social sector, and investments per ha only
17%.
Future Growth Strategy
1.13     In addition to the current policy of encouraging formation of
individual sector cooperatives and their cooperation with the social
sector, possible alternative strategies need to be examined to promote
modernization of the individual sector. Future agricultural growth and
achievement of related social and economic goals in SRM, depends largely
upon the speed with which individual farms can be modernized and their
productivity increased while at the same time continuing to develop social
sector agro-processing, marketing and distribution. Social sector primary
production will also continue to play an important, but proportionately
lesser, role. The individual sector development potential is large since
it includes most of the arable land and has low productivity. In addi-
tion: (a) small farms have reserves of under-utilized labor; (b) much of
the technology tested in the social sector can be, in many cases, applied
on these farms; and (c) when given technical assistance, credit, markets,
and irrigation, the individual farm sector has demonstrated its ability to
achieve higher levels of productivity than the social sector. The pace and
extent of individual farm sector modernization will depend largely on the
policy framework devised to promote progressively: (a) an increase in
financial resources allocated to investments in technically balanced
development packages, including irrigation; (b) channeling more technical
assistance into the sector; (c) concurrently, as part of a balanced
development strategy, encouraging individual farm families to leave the
land and take up employment in the growing non-farm rural sector; 1/
(d) consolidation of existing individual land holdings; and (e) at the
appropriate time, an increase in farm size ceilings.
1/  Farm sizes are generally too small from an economically efficient view-
point; a framework which allows individuals to consolidate fragmented
uneconomic holdings must ensure that adequate alternative employment is
available for those who elect to move out of farming. 'Balanced'
developeeat wouldl entsure an orderly transfer of people and labor from
the rural to the non-farm sector, 'balancing' the reduction of farm
sector employment opportunities with increasing non-farm employment.



-9-
Agro-processing and Marketing
1.14     Expansion of the agro-industries subsector was stressed in the
1976-80 social plan; and is expected to continue through 1981-86. The
existing policy framework for agro-industry development, however, needs
strengthening t:o cope with this expansion. A 1976 survey of all Yugoslav
agro-industries including food, beverage, and animal feed processing indi-
cated that from a total of 833 plants, about 15% were operating at 50% or
lower capacity. Food processing alone, particularly beverage, operated at
capacity levels below other industries; the all industry average, including
agro-processing, was 80%. In Macedonia, 46 food processing and beverage
plants were surveyed; 13% were operating at less than 50% capacity. Cur-
rently, overall agro-industry capacity utilization in SRM is about 50%;
in fruit processing it is about 25% but most wineries operate at near full
capacity. AIKs and the Republic Government Agencies generally coordinate
the planning of agroindustry growth. This worked well in the past, when
most agro-industrial development concerned only regional markets; but in
future, while agroindustry expansion should continue to be evaluated on a
regional basis, investments involving some food products and fruit juices,
should be considered more thoroughly in the national context.  Where
exports are concerned, wine and sour cherries for example, international
market evaluation is necessary. Also, more demand oriented planning and
coordination in balancing processing capacity with raw material supply is
needed.  A growing awareness of this need exists at the Federal level, but
more appreciation of this potentially serious problem is needed in many
Republics and Provinces. The problem is recognized by the government
authorities in Macedonia where emphasis is being given to increasing pri-
mary production- and hence capacity utilization of existing agro-processing
plants. The proposed project forms part of this strategy. An agro-
industry study, proposed under Agricultural Credit III Project (Loan
1801-YU), is expected to address the inter-regional demand and supply
aspect of certain lines of processed goods.
Pricing
1.15     In SRM about 55% of the total marketed surplus comes from the
individual sect:or. Individual producers make annual, or longer-term con-
tracts to suppLy their products to AIKs or BCOs at agreed prices. Under
the Yugoslav system the prices of most agricultural products are estab-
lished by social agreements which take into account production costs and
market demand. Subsidy and price support mechanisms are actively used to
correct the action of the market where this is considered to be socially
justified. In the past, guaranteed or minimum prices were established for
primary products and the structure of prices for finished products was
determined on the basis of these input prices. More recently the emphasis
has changed. lUnder the new system, self-management agreements between
producers and consumers first establish the price for finished products.
Allowances are made for acceptable levels of processing costs which in turn
determine primary product prices. If these prices are considered to yield



- 10 -
inadequate returns to the primary producers, then either prices of finished
products are revised upwards or subsidies are introduced. The current
system is still experimental, but, as experience is gained, it should
result in the pattern of final output becoming more responsive to the
structure of final demand. Also, since the system explicitly focuses on
the returns to primary producers, it should improve the ability of primary
producers to ensure that the prices they receive for their products reflect
changes in their input costs. This should limit instances of severe price
distortions which, as in the case of milk, have adversely affected produc-
tion. It remains to be seen, however, whether the new system will provide
an adequate spur to increased efficiency in the processing, distribution
and marketing system.
The 1981/1985 Social Development Plan
1.16     The new SRM social plan is expected to project annual production
increases of about 4% in agriculture: social sector 5.4%; individual
sector 3.4%. This compares to the 1976-80 actual annual growth of 4% in
the social sector and 1.3% in the individual sector. Fruit growing is
projected to increase annually by 5%, grape production by 5.5%, and live-
stock by 5%. These increases are expected to be achieved by rehabilitating
cultivable land which has been abandoned in recent years 1/; using more
irrigation; expanding individual and social sector cooperation; increasing
capacity utilization of agro-industrial complexes; and raising productivity
and yields by utilizing modern technology, especially in the individual
sector. In the past, planned growth rates have not always been achieved
although overall agricultural growth of nearly 4% in the last decade is
satisfactory. The 1977-78 growth of a little over 2% was due largely to
the 1977 drought. However, with its better resources--financial, land,
water, skilled manpower--allocated to it, social sector growth could be
improved. Compared to its potential, the individual sector receives a
disproportionately low share of development resources, and examination of
effective strategies designed to realize this potential deserves special
attention.
II. THE PROJECT AREA - THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
A. Physical Environment
2.00     Macedonia is the southern-most Republic of Yugoslavia; bordered in
the east by Bulgaria, south by Greece, and west by Albania; the northern
1/ The reasons for this are complex, but include the incomes which can be
obtained from farming marginal areas compared to those which are earned
in~ the- urban social sector; and the relatively undeveloped services
(market, credit, extension) available in such areas.



- 11 -
border is shared by the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo and the
Socialist Republic of Serbia. A major transport route--with the only major
railway and road connections between Central Europe, Greece, and Turkey--
follows the Vardar Valley through the center of Macedonia. The capital--
Skopje (populaltion 500,000)--is located at the intersection of this
north-south route with the northwest route from Kosovo to the western
section of the upper Vardar Valley (IBRD Map 15449). Most of the economic
activity and population is concentrated within this area. Another active
area is the Pelagonia Plain in the southwest, having about half,the total,
and much of the productive arable land of SRM. Most of the tobacco produc-
tion and processing industry is concentrated around Bitola and Prilep, the
second and third largest towns.
2.01     Of the total land area of 2.57 million ha about 1.31 million
(51%) is descr:ibed as agricultural; of this, about 557,000 ha (43%) are
cultivated, and some 657,000 ha consist of pastures. Compared to the rest
of Yugoslavia, SRM enjoys a generally more equitable climate which is
roughly divided into 3 main zones: (i) modified Mediterranean (along the
River Vardar): characterized by mild winters and warm summers; suitable
for intensive agriculture, especially early fruit and vegetables; (ii)
modified continental (Pelagonija and Polog) with cold winters and warm
summers; suitable for agricultural development but with low and uneven
annual precipitation; and (iii) mountainous having cold winters and a
short, but wet, summer growing period; suitable only for extensive live-
stock grazing. Within these climatic zones, soils are mainly alluvium and
delluvium, mostly free-draining loams, moderately fertile, slightly acid
and responsive to applications of phosphate, potassium, nitrogen, and in
some cases, caLcium. Except for isolated areas, soil drainage is not a
problem.
B. Land Use
2.02     Table 2, page 6 compares the broad land use patterns between SRM
and SFRY. Of the total cultivated land in SRM, 45% is sown to cereals
(wheat, maize, barley) compared to 64% in SFRY. Orchards and vineyards
comprise 9% and vegetables, 11% of the cultivated land, similar ratios to
that of SFRY. In Macedonia, however, pastures comprise 26% of the total
land area compared to only 17% for Yugoslavia as a whole, thereby reflect-
ing the mountainous terrain. In livestock production sheep predominate;
SRM, with 10% of Yugoslavia's total land area contains 28% (2M) of all
Yugoslavia's sheep compared to only 7% of the cattle and poultry, and 2% of
pigs.
C.  Irrigation
2.03     About 349,000 ha, representing 54% of the cultivable area, is
suitable for irrigation.  At end 1980, about 140,000 ha were brought within



- 12 -
the command of irrigation systems of which about 63,000 ha (45%) were
covered by sprinkler systems. However, only about 71,000 ha are currently
actually being irrigated. In addition to schemes for small areas, 25
medium and major schemes with 11 storage dams and 34 pumping stations, of
which ten pump directly from rivers or lakes, had been constructed.
Currently, Macedonia is implementing the Strezevo Project (Loan 1616-YU)
which, when completed, will irrigate about 20,300 ha. About fifty future
schemes have been identified to develop the remaining irrigation poten-
tial. Most of these (41) are in the Vardar Valley, where about 175,000 ha
of irrigation potential exist. The 1981-85 plan envisages one medium
scheme to cover about 9,000 ha and a number of small schemes for
15,000 ha. In addition to some of the small schemes to be financed under
this project, SRM is expected to request IBRD assistance with financing
several of the larger schemes under future irrigation projects.
D.  Performance Under Previous World Bank Projects
2.04     Since 1973, SBS has been the borrower in five World Bank loans
totalling $185 M; $48 M (26%) were for industrial credits and $137 M (74%)
for agricultural development including irrigation (Table 6, page 26).  Of
the $137 M borrowed for agricultural development, $67M N(49%) was disbursed
at April 30, 1980.  Agricultural Industries (Loan 894, 1973, $31 M) is
fully committed, as is Agricultural Industries II (Loan 1371, 1977),
although at April 30, 1980, only 40% was disbursed. The Macedonia Strezevo
Irrigation Project (Loan 1616, 1978) for $82 M was 24% disbursed and is on
schedule. SBS's share in the First, Second and Third Agricultural Credit
Projects (Loans 1129, 1477, 1801) totalled an additional $45 M. SBS's
share under the First Agricultural Credit Project is fully disbursed.
SBS's commitments and disbursements under the Second Agricultural Credit
project, especially with the Individual Sector, have been slow, although
all funds have now been committed.
2.05     While performance under previous Bank agricultural projects in
Macedonia has been improving and compared to many other countries is good,
it is still not entirely satisfactory. Procurement continues to cause
delays, and serious delays have arisen with the commitment of individual
sector loans. About US$2 M earmarked for individual sector investments
under the Third Agricultural Credit Project remains uncommitted and, until
recently, was behind schedule. The reasons for this are complex but
include: (a) insufficient local counterpart funds being available in some
Communes; (b) some Basic Banks (BB) confining individual sector loans to
use of local funds; (c) farmer resistance to the higher interest on IBRD
loans (12%) 1/ compared to local funds (7%) 1/; and (d) insufficient promo-
tion by SBS for the use of IBRD funds.
I/  Actual interest chXarges by SBS and BBs to BC0s are 11% for IBRD funds
and 6% for local funds; an additional 1% in each case is charged by the
BCOs to sub-borrowers making the final interest rates 12% and 7%.



- 13 -
2.06     The 'Government is seriously concerned about the slow commitment
and disbursement of funds particularly in the individual sector. Arising
from discussions during appraisal, Government and SBS have agreed to take
steps designed to accelerate individual sector loan commitments. These
include 'blending' the interest rate charged to individual farmer sub-
borrowers and inclusion of IBRD funds in all individual agricultural sector
development loans.  Consideration is also being given to raising the
interest paid on saving accounts, which, as funds for individual sector
lending are derived from these accounts, is likely to increase the amounts
available for individual sector lending.
2.07     Lesso:)ns learned so far from Bank agricultural lending operations
in Macedonia include the need for: (a) project preparation to be well
advanced; (b) procedures for accelerating individual sector loan commit-
ments to be strengthened; (c) greater emphasis on balanced development
between primary agricultural production and agro-processing; and (d) in
many cases, Borrower sub-project appraisal and supervision procedures to be
strengthened. The proposed project addresses these issues.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.00     The proposed investments would emphasize primary agricultural
production in both the individual and social sectors and be complementary
to programs fbinanced by previous Bank loans, especially in ensuring raw
materials for agricultural product processing and storage and in optimizing
utilization of irrigation facilities. The proposed project is designed to
generate economic activity throughout rural Macedonia. More specifically
it would aim at: increasing agricultural and forestry production; improv-
ing rural incomes and employment opportunities; increasing capacity utili-
zation of existing social sector agro-processing facilities; and assisting
SRM in developing alternative energy sources for agricultural production.
Institution building, through the continued use of SBS as project coor-
dinator, would be encouraged. The proposed project strategy includes;
increasing credit availability to both the individual and social sectors
for a wide range of productive on-farm investments including forestry;
constructing new, and expanding existing small-scale irrigation schemes;
improving market opportunities through expansion of cold storage facilities
for perishable agriculture products; supporting a pilot biogas production
unit; studying alternative methods for utilizing natural thermal waters;
and improving SBS staff training programs.



- 14 -
B.  Description
3.01     The project consists of an agricultural credit program, extending
over five years aimed largely at primary production (about 84% of cost
including irrigation), and also including investments for cold storage
facilities, and small-scale irrigation schemes. The project would also
include funds for a pilot forestry program, a pilot biogas plant and a
feasibility study of energy saving use of thermal water resources. Seven
major components are proposed as follows:
Social Sector (US$133.7M; 86%) 1/, 2/
Horticulture Production (US$63.4M; 41%)
3.02     Compared to the rest of Yugoslavia, Macedonia enjoys a comparative
advantage in the production of early and quality fruits, grapes and vege-
tables. Thus, the horticulture component is designed to: increase fruit
and grape production through the establishment of about 2,500 ha of
orchards and about 1,450 ha of vineyards, on land previously unirrigated or
with insufficient water. The orchard area would comprise a mix of 8 main
species in about 20 subprojects; the actual area of each would be kept
flexible and depend upon market conditions and demand by investors. How-
ever, due to probable marketing constraints, the maximum area to be planted
to apricots, peaches and sour cherries, unless otherwise agreed with the
Bank on the basis of updated market analysis, would be 100 ha, 100 ha, and
50 ha, respectively, in both the social and individual sectors. Project
viability, however, has been appraised on the basis of: apples 1,250 ha,
pears 550 ha, plums 300 ha, apricots 100 ha, peaches 100 ha, sour cherries
50 ha, and almonds 150 ha. Vineyard expansion would include about 950 ha
of table and 500 ha of wine grapes in about 20 subprojects. Table grapes
would be mostly marketed domestically, but a proportion of the wine grapes
(about 10%) would produce wine for export markets. Most fruit production
would be marketed domestically (para. 5.02); about half would be processed
into juices and other fruit products, thus increasing capacity utilization
of existing agro-processing facilities. All fruit plantings would be of
moderately high density (555/ha for almonds, apricots, and plums; 1,429/ha
of apples and pears). The program would continue the expansion of modern,
high producing, irrigated orchards and vineyards, established throughout
SRM in the last ten years. Investment model key assumptions are given in
Annex 3, Table T-4.
1/ Includes irrigation under which about 80% of beneficiaries would be
individual farmers.

Cold Stores (US$25.8M; 17%)
3.03     Existing Macedonian cold storage capacity comprises 103,800 tons
in 23 plants; including the proposed project and construction under Bank
financed projects (Loans 894-YU, 1371-YU) total installed capacity in 1985
would be 118,800 tons. The cold storage component would expand existing
capacity to store fresh and frozen fruit and vegetables after harvest for
later marketing, thus improving market opportunities and returns for both
social and individual sector produce. It would include one new 4,000 ton
capacity store, and the expansion of three existing facilities, two by
4,000 tons and one by 3,000 tons; about 80% would be used for storing
fruit and vegetables. The new facilities would be complete with receiving,
sorting, grading, preparing, processing, freezing and packing equipment.
The plants would be designed for efficient product flow and easy cleaning.
Fresh fruits and vegetables would be processed, packaged and quick frozen
for both domestic and export markets; demand for these products has been
expanding in recent years. The cold storage facilities would also be
utilized for short-term contract storage. Average base investment costs
are estimated at US$17,290 for each 1,000 M3 of storage space.
Forestry (US$4.5M; 3%)
3.04     In SiRM, timber demand far exceeds supply.  The forestry component
consists of two parts each being a separate sub-loan.  First, 300 ha of
riverbank landl currently in scattered trees and rough grazing would be
cleared, stumped and planted to poplar at the rate of 100 ha per year.
This would be part of a wider SRM program and would contribute towards
meeting the demand for poplar wood used for wood box and particle board
production. Rlootstock (280 trees/ha) would be locally raised from cuttings
originally made from varieties already proved suitable for the region.
Current land use is primarily river catchment protection and much of it
carries poor quality, low yielding poplars. Scope exists for poplar man-
agement schemes on about 5,000 ha, but experience is needed in land clear-
ance, including stumping, prior to reafforestation.  After planting, trees
would require maintenance for the first 6 years and harvesting would take
place in year 11. An annual increment of 27m3 per ha is projected.
Investment costs include land preparation, land clearing, root stock, addi-
tional plant and equipment and maintenance during the first 5 years of the
project.
3.05     The second part of the forestry component would;  (a) establish a
pilot demonstration/timber extraction area, including mechanized logging
operations with adequate all-weather road density to improve efficiency of
operations, reduce costs, and permit logging for most of the year; and (b)
convert about 40 ha of degraded woodland to experimental, fast growing
conifer plantation to assess growth rates and analyze returns from differ-
ent species using various management technologies. Conifer plantation
establishment would involve land clearance and tending techniques that are
relatively new to Macedonia.



- 16 -
3.06     Road density (5.3 km/1,000 ha) in exploited SRM forests is about
half that required for efficient extraction and forest management. Also,
extraction techniques are comparatively inefficient. The logging demon-
stration model would involve construction of all-weather roads (about 27
km) and improvement of existing dry weather approach roads (about 5 km).
The aim would be to remove mature trees from existing forest areas over
natural regeneration, thin other areas to promote natural regeneration, and
continue to clear fell and replant areas where natural regeneration is con-
sidered unlikely. A felling cycle of 20 years is projected and production
of 25,000 m3 could be obtained by taking approximately 50% of the stand-
ing volume from 175 ha per year. Production would be timber logs, indus-
trial small wood, and fuel wood. Rural Macedonian households still rely
heavily of wood as a domestic energy source and increasing its supply would
benefit some of the poorest segments of society. Because they are more in
the nature of research programs SBS normal lending and appraisal criteria
would not apply to the forestry components.
Small-Scale Irrigation Schemes (US$39.8M; 26%)
3.07     Significantly increased production of higher value crops can be
achieved in SRM through irrigation, using existing river flows by gravity
diversions and pumping. About 7 storage, river diversion pumping schemes
would irrigate nearly 12,000 ha. These schemes would involve completing
existing unfinished schemes and to some extent involve new areas. On-farm
irrigation would be by both sprinkler and gravity. Civil works would
include dams new intakes, intake repairs, remodeling of existing canals,
construction of new canals, and completion of distribution systems.
Detailed engineering design would be done by local consulting organiza-
tions. In the past, these local consultants have been associated with a
specialized foreign consultant firm and have produced satisfactory quality
of work with acceptable design criteria. Investments would be made by
Regional Water Economy Organizations (RWEO). Statutory bodies established
under 1957 Water Law and responsible, in their respective areas, for water
management and irrigation. About 80% of the affected land is currently
owned by individuals; up to 6,000 individual sector farm families (30,000
persons) would benefit from these investments. About 1,500 ha, in areas
from 50 to 555 ha, would be implemented by social sector AIKs on land
currently used for grazing or low value grain production. High value fruit
and grapes would be produced in modern orchards and vineyards. Although
fruit and grapes can be grown under rainfed conditions in many areas,
irrigation, especially on the better soils, can more than double production
in most years.
3.08     The irrigation component would be implemented over 5 years.
Excluding price contingencies, but including a 10% physical contingency,
gravity schemes (new and repair of existing diversions, main and secondary
canals, sprinkler equipment) are estimated to cost about US$3,390/ha 1/

and pumping schemes, excluding orchard and vineyard establishment, about
US$4,900/ha. The comparatively low cost/ha is due to the works involving
rehabilitation of existing schemes with sunk costs.
Individual Sector (US$20.4 M; 13%)
3.09     Individual sector development would be a continuation of similar
investments made under previous Macedonian projects and under the three
Yugoslav agrictultural credit projects. 1/ Through a four-year credit
program, the project would make investments in labor intensive activities
designed to increase employment opportunities, increase production of meat,
milk, fruit, grapes and vegetables, and increase capacity utilization of
existing agro-processing facilities. Investments would include improved
livestock (sheep, dairy, pigs, broiler, bees), animal housing and
respective equipment, fruit and vine rootstock, plastic houses and
grassland improvement. Also included would be small scale (3 ton capacity)
on-farm tobacco driers and related equipment; and appropriate size tractors
(up to 45 hp) and attachments. Tractor investments would be confined to
those farms where machinery investment formed part of a farm modernization
program expanding labor intensive production (vegetables, fruit, grapes,
dairy, sheep, pigs, poultry). Average base investment cost per farm (June
1980, post devaluation prices) has been estimated as follows: Dairy US$
17,410; sheep US$11,780; pigs US$12,080; broiler US$11,110; plastic house
US$3,560; orchard US$2,190; vineyard US$4,330; tobacco drier US$5,930; and
mechanization US$9,070. About 3,000 families (15,000 persons) most of whom
would be included in the area brought under irrigation (para. 3.07) would
benefit directly.   The actual number of investments for each farm type
would be kept flexible according to market conditions and individual
demand; appraisal has been based on: dairy, 120 farms; sheep 280; pig
fattening 86; broilers 60; plastic houses 108; orchards 600; vineyards
1,400; tobacco driers 150; mechanization 200. Livestock model key
assumptions are given in Annex 3, Table T-3; those for fruit, tobacco
drier, plastic house and mechanization in Table T-4.
Pilot Biogas Plant (US$0.6M; 0.4%)
3.10     To support SRM's efforts to diversify sources of energy used in
agriculture and reduce oil imports, the project would finance the installa-
tion of a biogas plant on a social sector pig farm producing about 10,000
fat pigs annually. The plant has been successfully tested in other coun-
tries (Switzerland, Germany and USA). At current prices, the unit would be
marginally viable financially; however, with expected real increases in oil
prices, would be economically sound and would provide valuable experience
upon which to base future investments. As a pilot operation the subproject
1/  Op. cit.  Through these projects over US$60 M have been made available
for investments by individual farmers or for facilities and services
benefitting the individual sector.



- 18 -
would not be subject to normal SBS appraisal criteria which normally
requires subprojects to have a minimum financial rate of return of 12%.
Implementation would proceed after a feasibility study, being prepared and
financed by SBS, has been reviewed and accepted by the Bank. Assurances to
this effect were obtained during negotiations.
Feasibility Study for Thermal Water Development (US$0.7M; 0.5%)
3.11     A feasibility study, to be completed by end 1982, would examine
the possibilities for thermal water development as an energy source for
use in agricultural production and agro-processing. The study would be
completed by suitably qualified consultants, Yugoslav or foreign, whose
qualifications, experience, and terms and conditions of employment would be
acceptable to the Bank and the Borrower. The consultants would be employed
by December 31, 1981. About 50 man-months of consulting services at an
estimated monthly base cost of US$12,000 (fees, travel, subsistence, over-
head) has been included in the cost estimates.
Project Implementation
3.12     Project implementation would commence in mid-1981 and continue
over five and a half years, to 1986. Assurances that the project as des-
cribed would be implemented, unless otherwise agreed by the Bank and the
Borrower, were obtained during negotiations. Most investments would be
committed in the first four years (Annex 1, Table T-5), and implementation
should be completed by end 1986 (Project Implementation Chart, Annex 3,
Chart 2). SBS would be the borrower and play the lead role in project
implementation. It would on-lend funds to social sector investors for
forestry, orchards, vineyards, cold stores, irrigation, and for the pilot
biogas plant and the thermal water feasibility study. In the individual
sector, loans would be made to individual subborrowers by SBS and its Basic
Banks (BB) through Basic Cooperative Organizations (BCO). Except for
larger irrigation schemes, SBS, BBs, AIKs and BCOs have adequate profes-
sional staff capable of identifying, appraising and supervising implementa-
tion of sound investment projects. All sub-projects would be in line with
the SRM 5-year Social Plan and the Social Plans of the Communes and various
enterprises and organizations. SBS would be supported by the Republic and
Commune extension services, and the Association of Cooperatives which, in
cooperation with SBS, BBs and AIKs, coordinates investments in the indi-
vidual sector. Additional support would be provided by the Research Insti-
tutes of the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Skopje, the specialized
technical services of the AIKs; and the Regional Water Economies respon-
sible for managing irrigation schemes including their design, construction
and management.

C. Status of Design and Sub-Project Identification
3.13     All sub-projects to be started in Project year 1 (1981-82),
including cold storage, social sector orchards and vineyards and forestry
have been identified and are in an advanced stage of preparation. SBS
estimates that up to Din 135 M (US$5 M) could be expended in Social Sector
orchard and vineyard sub-project implementation by end June 1981. Retro-
active financing of up to US$2 M is recommended (para 3.16). Irrigation
subprojects have been identified and detailed feasibility studies have been
completed or are well advanced for those to be started in 1981. For indi-
vidual sector sub-loans, SBS has identified the prospective BCOs through
which the sub-loans to individual farmers would be channelled and the
various investmrlent types to be made.
D. Cost Estimates
3.14     Total project cost, including physical and price contingencies,
but excluding permanent working capital and interest during construction,
is estimated at: Din 6,270M (US$232M), of which 30% or Din 1,880M (US$70M)
would be the foreign exchange component. Duties and taxes estimated at
about Din 270M (US$1OM) are included in the total project cost. Unit costs
have been based on June 1980 estimates, adjusted to reflect the direct
effects of the June 1980 Dinar devaluation and updated to June 1981 costs.
Cost estimates are shown in Table 4. An average physical contingency of
7% 1/ of base cost, and price contingencies 2/ which average 39% of base
cost plus physical contingencies, have been included in the cost estimates.
1/ 10% on irrigation, forestry, cold-stores and feasibility studies; 5% on
all other investments.
2/ Price contingencies have been calculated at the following expected
price increases expressed in percentage annual increases.

Working Papers (Annex 4).
E. Financing
3.15     The financing plan is shown in Table 5.  The proposed Bank loan of
US$80M would finance 100% of foreign exchange costs, and part of the
interest during construction on the Bank loan. Financing of interest
during construction, for up to 5 years, is justified by the financial
requirements of sub-borrowers. Project investments in vineyards, orchards,
forestry, and in some cases, irrigation have long gestation periods and
slow build up of cash flows. Without the inclusion of this provision, the
cash flow positions of sub-borrowers during the construction period would
be imprudently stretched. The Bank loan would be made to SBS for 15 years
incluaing 3 years grace.  SBS would on-lend the loan proceeas to the sxD-
borrowers in accordance with the terms and procedures described in para-
graphs 4.21-4.28.

Sub-borrowers (and FNP)      58.1          9.6          67.7            24
The Bank loan would be repaid on the basis of an adjustable repayment
schedule, reflecting the composite repayments of sub-loans by the sub-
borrowers. Since individual sector loans are grouped together and made
through Cooperatives the adjustable repayment schedule can also be used for
these sub-loans. Assurances on these conditions were obtained during nego-
tiations.
F. Retroactive Financing
3.16     Preparation of many subprojects is well advanced.  All funds
available for primary production investments under Loans 1129-YU and
1477-YU are now fully committed. Also to avoid the loss of one growing
season and to speed-up project implementation, preliminary land preparation
work under the social sector horticulture component has, in many cases,
already started. Retroactive financing of these expenditures up to an
amount of US$2 million is recommended.
G. Disbursements
3.17     Disbursement of the proposed Bank loan of US$80 million would
extend over 6 years and be made as follows:
(a)  Social sector subloans for horticulture, cold stores, forestry and
irrigation (US$56.6M): 100% of foreign expenditures and 40% of
local expenditures subject to a maximum of 32% of the total
estimated cost of the sub-project.
(b)  Individual sector subloans for livestock, horticulture, plastic
houses, tobacco drying houses and equipment, and farm mechaniza-
tion (US$12M): 100% of foreign expenditure and 50% of local
expenditure subject to a maximum of 40% of the total estimated
cost of the sub-project.
(c)  Thermal Water Feasibility Study: 100% of expenditures (US$0.8M).



- 22 -
(d) Pilot Biogas Plant: 100% of foreign expenditures and 80% of local
expenditures subject to a maximum of 65% of the total estimated
cost of the sub-project (US$0.6M).
(e) Interest during construction (US$l0M): 100% of IBRD interest and
commitments fee up to a maximum of US$1OM.
3.18     No disbursements would be made against any sub-loans committed by
the Borrower after June 30, 1985 under the horticulture, forestry,
irrigation, cold store and biogas components and after June 30, 1986 for
individual sector components. Disbursements would be supported by full
documentation in the case of foreign expenditures under all sub-loans. For
all other subloans, the Bank would disburse against statements of expen-
diture (SOE), since they would involve on-lending largely for comparatively
small borrowers by SBS, and would finance small and numerous expenditures.
SBS has been using SOE procedures under previous Bank financed projects.
The documentation supporting SOEs would be subject to SDK audit (para.
4.33) and would be retained by SBS for inspection by supervision missions
during project implementation. Disbursements for sub-projects costing more
than US$3.5 M equivalent would be subject to presentation to IBRD of a
satisfactory appraisal report (para. 4.12). Assurances on these
disbursement procedures were obtained during negotiations. Annex 2 gives
an estimated disbursement schedule summarized as follows:
Bank FY           FY82     FY83      FY84     FY85      FY86      FY87

En preparing the disbursement schedule account has been taken of the pro-
posed project phasing Annex 3, Chart 2, and past Yugoslav disbursement
profiles for Bank financed projects.
H. Procurement
3.19     Civil works financed under the cold storage and irrigation com-
ponents, and social sector horticulture investments would be carried out
on the basis of a contract awarded through local competitive bidding,
advertised locally and in accordance with procedures acceptable to the
Bank. Most equipment required under the irrigation, and social sector
horticulture investments would be procured by local competitive bidding.
Adequate competition exists in Yugoslavia for this purpose. Civil works
financed under the forestry component, which is more experimental in
nature, and which would be implemented by established social sector orga-
nizations, are not suitable for local competitive bidding and are expected
to be carried out under force account procedures.



- 23 -
3.20     Equipment for the cold storage plant with an estimated cost of
about US$16M, would be procured following International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) in accordance with Bank Guidelines for Procurement of March 1977.
Tender documernts for supply and installation of equipment are under prep-
aration and are expected to be issued during July 1981. Domestic manufac-
tures would receive a 15% margin of preference or the actual level of
import duties which ever is less for the purpose of bid comparisons. It is
estimated that about US$10M of the ICB procurement would be awarded to
foreign suppliers.
3.21     ICB would not be suitable for works and equipment connected with
individual sector investments (US$33M). They are unlikely to be attractive
to foreign contractors and suppliers due to dispersion of the investors,
wide differences in the type of construction and equipment required, phas-
ing of contracts over 5 years, and the relatively small size of each sub-
project ranging in size from about US$1,000 to US$20,000. Where necessary,
procurement for these components would be done through existing commercial
channels with local procurement procedures and would be supervised by SBS.
Adequate competition for the supply of goods and civil works in this manner
is available in Yugoslavia. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that procurement procedures outlined in paras 3.19 through 3.21 would be
followed.
I. Water Rights
3.22     All the irrigation sub-projects would be in the Vardar River
Valley. Agreements between Yugoslavia and Greece define the water rights
of the two countries on the Vardar River. The diversions proposed under
the project are comparatively minor and are permissable under the terms of
the agreements. The Government of Macedonia has submitted to the Bank a
statement from the Government of Greece acknowledging that they have been
duly notified that the proposed schemes for the project comply with the
agreements, and that the works meet with their approval.
J. Environmental Effect
3.23     The project would have no negative environmental effects in the
project area. The forestry and irrigation subprojects, through soil
erosion and water runoff control, would have a positive effect.



- 24 -
K. Role of Women
3.24     Yugoslavia has made considerable progress in ensuring equal oppor-
tunities for women.  Of the SFRY active agricultural labor force, 20% are
women; in SRM, 21%.  In the social sector, probably as many women are
employed as men.  Women enjoy equal payment with men.  In SBS, including
the Basic Banks, a high proportion of professional staff are women.  Women
are expected to gain at least 40% of employment opportunities created in
the social sector investments.
IV. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Institutional Arrangements
4.00     The Borrower, SBS, would be responsible for supervising project
implementation. Investments would be made by AIKs, WEOs, and, through
BCOs, by individual farmers. The Commune of Kocani would be responsible
for the thermal water feasibility study. Self Management Agreements (SMA)
in Yugoslavia are important contractual documents which detail each party's
obligations and are concluded only when clear agreement is established,
usually after long negotiations. Under the Project, no special SMA between
SBS and the investors is necessary since: (a) the Associated Bank has a
SMA with all 24 basic banks (BB); (b) the BBs have SMAs with their owner
enterprises (or founders) and investors; (c) the enterprises have SMAs with
the BOALs which comprise the working organization (para. 1.04); (d) each
subloan requires a loan agreement between the BB and SBS, and the borrowing
enterprise or BCO; and (e) each subloan requires a loan agreement between
the BCO and the individual borrower (para. 4.28). In addition, all the
social sector sub-projects to be considered under the proposed project form
an integral part of Macedonia's new 1981-85 Five-year Plan. In respect to
the individual sector, SBS has prepared a proposal, which has been reviewed
by the Bank, that involves a separate agreement with its basic banks and
other republic organizations to ensure better access and the timely
provision of funds. These arrangements would be finalized as a condition
of effectiveness.
B. The Borrower: Stopanska Bank, Skopje (SBS)
4.01     SBS was restructured in 1978 in accordance with the federal bank-
ing law of January 1978. It consists of 24 basic banks (formerly branch
offices) throughout SRM, with the associated bank 1/ in Skopje. It has

Bank; it conducts inter-alia, all SBS business involving loreign

offices in Belgrade, London, Frankfurt, Toronto, New York, and Sydney. SBS
has been the borrower of five World Bank loans totalling US$185 million
(Table 6, page 26). Within the framework of SRM's Social Plan, SBS is the
major lender for both agriculture and industrial projects; about three
quarters of all SRM institutional financing is channelled through SBS. SBS
impact on project preparation is large, as many projects, especially the
major ones, are brought to SBS' attention at the conceptual stage.
4.02     Yugoslav banks have "founders" or members, which contribute the
equity capital or 'Founders Funds'. The associated bank founders are the
24 BBs which, in turn, are 'owned' by organizations of associated labor
from most of the enterprises in the region served by individual BBs. Each
'founder' has unlimited liability for the obligations of the BB. Each
BB is responsible directly to the President of the associated bank and
carries out banking functions with considerable autonomy.
4.03     The assembly of SBS is its highest governing body and is made
up of delegates elected by members (Chart 1, page 27). The assembly
approves the bank's five year plan, annual plan and business policy includ-
ing interest rates and elects, from among its delegates, the executive
and credit committees. It also decides on total income distribution to
employees and members. The executive committee implements the plans and
policies approved by the assembly and approves lending and borrowing
activities; it delegates authority to the credit committee to approve
smaller loans.

4.04     Senior management of SBS is competent.  Managers are university
graduates with many years experience, often in both banking and industry.
The chief executive, the President, is appointed by the bank's assembly.
He is assisted by four Vice-Presidents. SBS is organized into four divi-
sions: joint operations (planning, statistics, short-term operation,
public relations, data processing), investment, international, and admin-
istration. Each is responsible to the President or his deputies. The
investment division is sub-divided into five departments for industry,
processing industry, agro-industry and forestry, credit, and engineering.
The Agro-industry and Forestry Department (para. 4.08) would appraise and
supervise implementation of loans under the proposed project. In June
1980, the number of SBS employees was 510; and 1,736 in the 24 BBs. About
40% are professionals.
4.05     The current arrears position notwithstanding (para 4.07), SBS's
financial position is considered satisfactory. 1/ From 1977 to 1979, total
assets increased 64% from Din. 50.9 billion to Din. 83.4 billion. The
increase in constant 1977 Dinars, however, was 20%. Federal and Republic
funds account for 37% of long-term resources. Long-term borrowing has
increased from Din. 20.1 billion to Din. 31.2 billion in 1979; a 55%
increase. Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization (equity
plus long-term borrowing) has remained stable at about 86%. The long-term
debt equity ratio at December 31, 1979 was 6.7 and reached 9.7 in 1978.
Loans from the Federal and Republic funds, however, account for 55% of
long-term borrowing; exclusion of these debts gives a more satisfactory
debt equity ratio of 3.7.
4.06     Savings and deposits (excluding demand deposits) have increased by
Din. 11.1 billion from 1977 to 1979; or 79%. The increase in constant 1977
Dinars, however, was Din. 4.4 billion or 31%.  Similarly, the 1977 total
loan portfolio of Din. 43.8 billion in 1977 increased to Din. 73.3 billion
in 1979 (67%) (53.5 billion (22%) in constant 1977 Dinars); short-term
loans comprise 29% of the total loan portfolio and long-term loans 71%.
Short-term loans, mainly for seasonal working capital, are made by BBs from
their own resources. At December 1979, Din. 15.8 billion or 76% of total
short-term loans were to enterprises. Similarly, 62% of total outstanding
long-term loans (December 1979) were to enterprises for capital investments
and other purposes. An analysis of new loan approvals made in 1978 and
1979 is given in Table 7, page 29. New loans to the agricultural sector in
1979 totalled Din 845 million; 7% of the total amount but 6% less than in
1978. Agriculture received 12% of new short term loans in 1979 compared to
23% in 1978. Total new loans granted in 1979 increased by 18% over the
1978 amount, although in constant 1978 Dinars this represents a decrease of
3%. 2/ Balance sheets and income statements for 1977-79 are given in Annex
3, Tables T-9 and T-10, and a loan portfolio analysis for 1977-79 in T-ll.
1/ Financial analysis for the associated bank as a whole, including all
basic banks.
2/ During 1979, domestic inflation was estimated to be 22%/.

4.07     SBS objective is to minimize the cost of borrowing and not to
maximize profits. Its financial performance has been satisfactory. During
1977-79, operating income increased by 66%, from Din. 3.2 billion to Din.
5.3 billion; operating expenses were remarkably steady at between 78% and
80% of operating income; net income as a percentage of operating income
varied between 17% and 19%; return on total assets was 1.5% in 1978 and
1979; administration expenses averaged 8% of operating income; and average
return on net worth was 19% for 1977 and 1978; 22% for 1979. Debts
written-off as a percentage of total operating income varied between 0.2%
and 0.9%; no significant write-off of arrears was made and loan reschedul-
ing has been minimal. Unmanageable losses are unlikely in future and ade-
quate provision has been made for possible small losses. Long-term loans
in arrears of over 3 months at December 1979 totalled Din. 13.8 billion;
25% of the total loan portfolio. Principal in arrears of over 3 months
totalled Din. 2.2 billion of which 20% was in arrears exceeding 12 months.
4.08     Although conventional assessments of credit-worthiness are largely
inappropriate in the Yugoslav banking system, SBS credit-worthiness is
acceptable since: (a) past loan losses have been small and arrears are
manageable; (b) the management observes sound banking principles; resource
management and project selection procedures are satisfactory; (c) the con-
tinuing solvency of SBS is assured because (i) the basic member banks and,
in turn, the founder members have unlimited liability for the associated
bank's obligations; (ii) under the existing Yugoslav economic system, each
bank's credit-worthiness is closely related to that of the Yugoslav economy
itself; and the possibility of a bank failure is conceivable only with the
concurrent failure of the entire economic system.
C. The SBS Agro-industry and Forestry Department
4.09     The Agro-industrial Department is responsible for all agro-
industry, agriculture, livestock, irrigation, and forestry investments.
It is one of five departments within the Investment Operations Division
(Chart 1, page 27). The current Department Director holds university
qualifications in agronomy and economics. The staff includes 14 profes-
sionally qualified personnel, many of whom have long experience. They
include senior advisers for agriculture, agricultural machinery, orchards,
vineyards, livestock, agro-industry, irrigation, and forestry; other SBS
department staff also give direct assistance to the Agroindustry Department
(Annex 3, Chart 1). Personnel are responsible for appraising loans to both
the social and individual sectors. They are in regular contact with BBs
and with investors, particularly in the social sector.
4.10     The Department also supervises loans and investment projects
throughout the Republic. In the individual sector, contacts are through
the BCOs responsible for cooperation with the individual sector. Contact
'betwee,n %IS                           %troinsnsEoiaQ  iwcastoz&t istffi 7 T4tal sector borrowers
is limited. Also the amount of field supervision is not in accordance with
the Department's responsibilities and needs improving (paras 4.31, 4.32).

D. On-Lending Procedures
4.11     Social sector sub-projects are first prepared by the concerned
enterprise, and then submitted to the respective BB. Those loan applica-
tions which exceed the BBs' resources, or involve Federal or Republic
funds, or foreign exchange, are passed to the associated bank (SBS) for
consideration; these include IBRD financed investments for both individual
and social sect:ors. Following a satisfactory review of the detailed loan
application, including its financial viability, and in some cases a field
appraisal by SBS appraisal staff, the SBS credit board approves each loan.
For local funds, loans are approved by the BB credit board. For the
individual sector, loan applications are made through the concerned BCO;
25-50 applications are grouped and forwarded to the respective BB.  If only
local funds are involved the BB credit board approves the loan following a
satisfactory appraisal. The associated bank does not approve a loan unless
the BB first approves the local funds.
4.12     Except: for the forestry, bio-gas and thermal water feasibility
study, in approving sub-loans involving IBRD funds SBS would ensure that:
(a) subprojects are technically feasible, have a minimum 12% financial and
economic rate of return, and would generate sufficient cash flow to cover
debt service,  [egal obligations, and reinvestment needs; (b) adequate and
continuing technical assistance and market outlets are assured; (c) for
lending to individual farmers through BCOs, the cooperation agreements are
satisfactory; (d) adequate organizational and staffing arrangements are
made for the irmplementation of subprojects; (e) the necessary amount of
seasonal credit is made available for subprojects; and (f) appropriate
attention is given to the economic impact of subprojects, including
employment, income, import-export effects. In addition to the above
appraisal guidelines and methodology to be followed by SBS in making
sub-loans under the project, SBS would ensure for irrigation sub-projects
that; (a) cost recovery analysis would be undertaken by the relevant
Regional Water Economy Organization in order to set water charges that
would be sufficient to recover operations and maintenance costs and a
reasonable proportion of the debt service based on ability-to-pay criteria;
and (b) arrangements for the use of the irrigated land and on-farm
development wiLl include adequate measures to ensure maximum production.
For irrigation sub-projects where the estimated cost exceeds Din. 135 M
(US$5 M), SBS would establish a special appraisal committee comprised of an
agronomist, agricultural economist and a consulting irrigation engineer.
The committee would prepare a report on the technical, financial and
economic viabiLity of the sub-project.  A satisfactory review of the report
by IBRD would be a condition of sub-loan approval for these subprojects.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that SBS would follow the
above criteria in appraising projects. All subproject appraisal reports
would be available for inspection by the Bank at request, or during project
supervision, to ensure that agreed methodologies are followed. All subloan
approvals would be reported to the Bank at quarterly intervals.  Sub-loans
for any sub-project costing more than US$3.5 million under the horti-
culture, cold stores, and irrigation components and all sub-loans for the



- 32 -
forestry and biogas components, would be submitted along with SBS's
appraisal reports to the Bank for approval. If on the basis of these
appraisals, any of the proposed investments are found to be not viable,
alternative investments could be considered for financing as agreed with
the Bank.
4.13     For individual sector farmers, additional criteria are followed by
BBs and SBS. An individual sector applicant must: (a) have completed an
agreement with the BCO for the sale and purchase of specific crops, which
agreement must be for the same term as the proposed credit; (b) be a
genuine farmer 1/; (c) be creditworthy; (d) produce evidence that commune
taxes have been paid; (e) have the area of land which is specified by the
BB for the region concerned as being the minimum required to be financially
viable; (f) be a depositor with the basic bank; and (g) produce his
registered land title. SBS is reviewing its procedures with the objective
of reducing the number of qualifying criteria and thereby improving
sub-borrower access to credit.
E. On-Lending Terms and Conditions
4.14     Project sub-loan terms would be based on the cash flow projections
for each investment. Repayment of individual sector sub-loans would
normally not exceed 10 years, including a grace period of up to 5 years.
For social sector primary production and cold store subprojects, repay-
ments would normally not exceed 15 years including a 5 year grace period.
The exception would be forestry, irrigation, and biogas where subloans
would be for up to 15 years including 6 years grace. Social sector sub-
borrowers would normally contribute not less than 20% of total investment
costs. In less-developed communes, SBS, with government approval, may
require a lower than 20% contribution from the enterprise concerned and in
more developed communes a higher contribution.  Some sub-borrowers,
however, may not have resources sufficient to meet the required minimum
amount; SBS would then determine the maximum amount of sub-borrower
contribution which can be derived from the FNP 2/ and Republic Special
Funds. In accordance with Yugoslav law, FNP and Republic Special Funds
contributions to a sub-project would be treated as a part of sub-borrower
contributions. For individual sub-borrowers, the minimum contribution is
normally 20% of total investment costs.; as cash, materials, or the
individual's labor.
1/ Part time farmers are not eligible for credit.
2/ Federal Fund for Assistance to Undeveloped Regions.



- 33 -
4.15     The interest rates for on-lending under the project would be:  (a)
for Bank funds the on-lending rate to be charged by SBS to sub-borrowers
under the primary production, irrigation and cold store components would be
a minimum of 11%. This is in line with the approximate average cost of
long-term foreign exchange resources in Yugoslavia and in international
capital markets. For the feasibility study, pilot biogas plant and
forestry demonstration schemes under the project, the lending rate would be
the Bank rate of 9.6%, plus an additional spread of at least 0.5% to cover
administration costs; (b) for the portion of domestic funds provided to
sub-borrowers from the resources of SBS, the interest rate would be a
minimum of 10%; and (c) for the portion of domestic funds which are
provided to sub-borrowers from the Federal and Republic Special Funds, the
interest rate would be determined in accordance with the prevailing rates
set by the Federal and Macedonian authorities, currently between 4% and
7%. The social sector sub-borrowers bear the foreign exchange risk and the
foreign exchange risk on loans to the individual sector are borne by the
Macedonian government--the same arrangements as for previous IBRD loans for
agriculture in Yugoslavia.
4.16     Assurances were obtained during negotiations that:  (a) SBS would
apply these on-lending terms and conditions to project sub-loans; and (b)
for individual sector loans, one composite interest rate which blends the
different rates charged on IBRD funds and those from other sources, would
be charged to the sub-borrower. Currently, sub-borrower loan agreements
show separate interest rates depending on the source of loan funds. The
difference between the IBRD rate and that charged on local funds--5%--is
believed to be one of the factors currently constraining the use of
institutional credit by individual farmers. Based on subloans comprising
50% IBRD funds and 50% local funds the 'blended' interest rate to
individual sector sub-borrowers would be 9.5% annually.
4.17     The on-lending rates were arrived at after considering the recent
study on the rol,e of interest rates in the Yugoslav economy, the Bank's
policy relating to real interest rates, and specific country considera-
tions. They are in line with the rates agreed for the Fifth Industrial
Credit Project (Loans 1909-1912), the Morava Regional Development II
Project (Loan 1951), and the Kosovo Agricultural Development Project (Loan
1993) and with t'he average cost of long-term foreign exchange resources in
Yugoslavia and in the international capital markets. The annual Yugoslav
inflation rate averaged about 17% in 1976-80. While inflation increased
sharply in 1981, a 16% annual rate is projected for the next 3 years.
4418     Sub-loanis are secured through loan agreements between the BB or
SBS, or both, and the concerned enterprise. The loan agreements describe
the purpose for which the sub-loans are made, and specify loan repayment
schedules, interest rates, grace periods, and other conditions. For indi-
vidual sector sub-loans, loan agreements are first made between the BB or
SBS, or both, andl the concerned BCO. The BCO gives the BB a blank bill of
exchange sufficient to cover the debt service requirements. The BCO then
contracts a loan agreement with the individual farmer, who provides the



- 34 -
BCO with blank bills of exchange guaranteed by at least 2 credit-worthy
guarantors. Furthermore, in cases of large loans or where some element of
doubt over ability to repay exists, the BB or SBS will take a form of
mortgage over the sub-borrower's land.
F. Participating Organizations and Supporting Services
4.19     The following organizations would play important roles in either
assisting SBS or implementing subprojects.
Agroindustrial Kombinats (AIK)
4.20     In addition to AIKs concerned with tobacco production, processing
and marketing, there are about 10 major AIKs in Macedonia, all of which
come under the umbrella organization, United Agroindustrial Kombinat of
Macedonia. The United Kombinat is managed by experienced, qualified, and
usually capable staff, which includes a full range of technical, financial
and other professional persons. SBS works closely with the United Kombinat
and the Secretariat of Agriculture. A high proportion of AIK managerial
staff is experienced and well qualified. Each AIK employs technically
qualified personnel for planning and supervising activities in their
field. For example, the professionals handling technical aspects of
tobacco, orchard, vineyard, poultry, pig, dairy, and sheep production are
generally high quality. Agricultural economics expertise, however, needs
improving. AIKs also initiate their own development plans, prepare sub-
projects and, before submitting loan applications to BBs and SBS, do an
initial appraisal of their financial viability. Most AIKs are well
equipped with plant and machinery.
Irrigation 1/
4.21     The Republic Committee for Water Economy (RCWE) is responsible for
water economy policy and approves all water use in SRM. The Committee
President is a Republican Executive Council member. RCWE has no executive
powers. It has prepared surface water utilization plans up to year 2000;
2025 for the Vardar River. The Central Water Economy Organization (CWEO)
acts as the coordinating body for 17 organizations, including 15 regional
"Water Economy Organizations" in the regions, "Melioproject", a design con-
sulting organization, and "Novo Gradvo", a construction enterprise. CWEO
details future programming and implements approved plans; it has a staff
of 60 qualified people. WEOs, each of which may have several irrigation
systems, currently cover the entire Republic. A new WEO can be formed for
a specific project. All projects are proposed by WEOs based on feasibility
studies prepared by consultants, usually Melioproject. Projects submitted
by WEOs are first examined by CWEO and then submitted to RCWE for
approval. RCWE works closely with the Secretary for Agriculture and
am  t3z Q-   tte  for Power Economy.
1/ See Working Paper C-10 for background on the irrigation sub-sector.



- 35 -
4.22     WEOs contribute a minimum of 20% of new project costs, usually by
payments from water users. The remaining 80% are loans from banks and con-
tributions from the Republic. Land acquisition costs are generally borne
by the respective Commune. WEOs execute larger project construction work
through contractors after inviting bids. Small works are done by WEOs
using their own staff and equipment. Civil, mechanical and electrical
contractors are available within the Republic and the work quality is
good.  WEOs operate and maintain irrigation systems.  Water masters record
farmers' crop areas upon which water charges are based. Water charges are
calculated for each year and allow for expected annual operating expenses.
They are subject to approval of the respective Commune; considerations
other than financial can sometimes result in annual charges being less than
necessary. Water charges vary from one irrigation system to another. In
some cases social sector water charges are higher than in the individual
sector. Under a new law currently proposed, water charges in each region
would be uniform. Charges would be 2 tiered: first a flat rate based on
area irrigated, and second, a variable charge according to the crops
grown. The fixed charge would cover most of the amortization and debt
service costs, while the variable rate would cover operation and
maintenance costs.
Forestry
4.23     About 92% (815,400 ha) of Macedonian forests are within the social
sector; the balance is held by individuals. The Committee for Agriculture,
Forestry, and Water Resources within the Secretariat of Agriculture has
ultimate responsibility for forest development. It formulates policy,
monitors the forestry programs, approves development plans for all forestry
areas, and supervises forestry operations through a system of inspector-
ates. About 20% of Macedonian social forests are managed by small, unasso-
ciated BCOs. Most BCOs, however, are members of two AIKs: TRESKA, which
covers about 60% of social sector forests; and CRNI BOR, which covers some
10%. Together thiey include 21 forestry BCOs and 17% of forestry processing
industry. Forestry research is done primarily by the Forestry Institute
(University of Skopje; para 4.28) with which TRESKA and CRNI BOR cooperate
closely. The Institute provides a seed testing service. BCOs prepare
their own forestry management plans. Forestry inventories are made by a
separate forestry management organization.
4.24     The Forestry Organizations are equipped with adequate trained
staff to plan and implement forestry subprojects. Extraction methods,
however, are mostly obsolete and efficiency could be much improved through
appropriate mechanization. Furthermore, increased density of all-weather
roads are required to: extend the logging season, allow harvest of cur-
rently untapped wood supplies, improve capacity utilization in forest
industries where currently surplus capacity exists, and increase foreign
exchange earnings through exports. Mechanization of forestry operations,
particularly logging, is required to reduce costs, improve working condi-
tions, arrest increasing labor shortages in rural areas, and increase wood
supplies. Also, to provide for greater self-sufficiency in industrial wood
supplies, the initiation of fast growing industrial plantation programs
involving intensive land preparation and treatment is required.

The Association of Cooperatives
4.25     The Association of Organizations in Individual Agriculture
(Cooperative Association) promotes the growth of agricultural production in
the individual sector, throughout SRM. BCOs have established organized
production and cooperation with more than 100,000 individual families in
production of grapes, fruit, vegetables, tobacco, sugar beet, sunflower,
milk, meat and other agricultural products. In SRM, there are 82 agricul-
tural cooperatives and 26 BCOs in AIKs. 1/ They have trained staff who,
inter-alia, promote agricultural production on individual farms, marketing
of products, and other activities which contribute to improving living
conditions. The 108 cooperatives employ 1,776 technically qualified
personnel; 16 each on average. BCOs serve as guarantors for Bank loan
repayments; they decide upon which farms credits shall be made, plan the
production process with the farmer, guarantee the market for the products
at a price agreed upon in writing, and arrange for repayment of loan
funds. The written agreement between the individual and the BCO also
specifies the technology to be employed, including seed type and rate,
planting date, fertilizer type and rate, and for livestock, the feed types
and amounts; and so on.
4.26     Agriculture Extension.  The amount of technical assistance avail-
able to individual sector farmers and AIK primary production BOALs is
satisfactory. The Republic Extension Service comprises 11 qualified
subject matter specialists stationed in Skopje, and a further 123 extension
workers operating in 30 commune extension services. Except for the
Republic Extension Service, which is SRM's financial responsibility, the
service is financed equally by the Republic and the Commune (60% to 70%
being the Republic's share in less developed communes). The Commune Exten-
sion Service provides technical assistance to individual farmers. Much
staff time, however, is taken up with subsidy schemes available only to
members of BCOs including cooperatives. The Commune Service also maintains
a weather recording service. Extension staff are required to assist indi-
vidual farmers in preparing investment programs and completing loan appli-
cation formalities. The Republic Service is more of an information rather
than extension service. It disseminates research results from the various
agricultural institutes (para. 4.28) to the Commune Extension staff and
specialists in AIKs, organizes training courses and conferences, assists
with mass media extension on radio and television, provides back-up subject
matter specialist support, and helps organize farmer field demonstrations
and competitions. While 134 extension workers to 161,000 individual
farmers (average farm size 3 ha) is an unsatisfactory ratio, individual
farmers also receive technical assistance from experts employed by BCOs and
AIK BOALs responsible for cooperation with the individual sector. The
total number of technical experts, therefore, who assist farmers throughout
SRM is about 1,910 (1,776 + 134). The ratio of technical assistants to
y,  'Aost tlXXs have a B4& L    xsAbT  for promoting cooperation with the
individual sector; iigures  Nipe-      y A-atiie&  Association for

socially organized farmers (100,000) 1/ is 1:52. For the 61,000 farmers
not belonging to BCOs, the ratio is about 1:1,225.
4.27     Veterinary Service.  The veterinary service in Macedonia is ade-
quate for all livestock owner requirements. Qualified veterinarians total
172 and veterinary technicians 250. Of these, 137 veterinarians and 200
technicians are employed in veterinary services and agricultural organiza-
tions of associated labor; they operate from about 30 centers. Compulsory
vaccination against rabies, fowl plague, red lung, tuberculosis and
brucellosis is done by the veterinary services. Vaccines are not produced
in SRM but adequate supplies are available from other parts of Yugoslavia.
Veterinary clinics are adequately equipped and well operated and are self-
supporting financially. Artificial insemination (AI) services are usually
available at the veterinary centers. Various subsidies, paid partly by the
Republic and partly by the Communes, include AI, purchase of improved
sires, pasture improvement, frame hive purchases, and milk production.
4.28     Agricultural Research.  Agricultural research in SRM is centered
in the various institutes of the Faculty of Agriculture, University of
Skopje. Seven institutes integrate teaching, research and extension:
agronomy, livestock improvement, vineyards, orchards, soil and chemistry,
plant protection, and economics. The staff of each varies from 20 to 40;
most are highly qualified with advanced degrees. Financing research is
done largely through contracts with enterprises. Some institutes have
their own field stations; many use social sector land, usually at no cost,
to conduct reslearch activities. Livestock Institute services include pre-
paring recipes for feed compounds, and assessing concentrate feed quality
for buyers. It also does sheep breeding research consisting mainly of
evaluating imported breeds. In dairying, a long-term breed evaluation for
milk production has resulted in widespread adoption of friesian cattle for
intensive milk production in the social sector, and major changes in the
individual sector. Currently, research includes evaluating beef production
using local busha cattle crossed with improved European breeds. The
Veterinary Institute, inter alia, operates the AI Center. AI is available
to both social sector enterprises and individual farmers. The Institute
of Agriculture (forage production) works with improvement of pasture-
meadow 2/ produLction.
1/ Figure provided by Association of Cooperatives as being the number of
individuals cooperating, in one form or another, with the social
sector; not all 100,000 are members of BCOs and therefore not fully
integrated in the absolute sense; according to the Statistical Year
Book of Macedonia (1979) 3,439 farmers were full members of 58
cooperatives. These may not include those farmers who are fully
integrated members of AIK BOALs responsible for cooperating with the
individual sector.
2/ In Yugoslavia, 'pasture' is natural grazing, which cannot be cut for
hay; 'meadows' are areas which can be cut for hay and have never been
seeded; 'artificial meadows' are cultivable areas sown with improved
species, sometimes fertilized.



I - 38 -
4.29     Research work of the Orchard and Vineyard Institutes includes such
areas as general pomology and viticulture, testing new varieties, test
planting at new locations, tree and vine spacing, plant nutrition, wine
making, nursery practices, plant protection, rootstocks and so on. The
professional staff is well trained and closely involved in the applied side
of orchard and vineyard growing. Nearly all technology applied by social
and individual sector orchards and vineyards derives from institute recom-
mendations; the work is of a high standard.
G. Training and Supervision
4.31     SBS has a training role for its own staff, those of BBs and, to
some extent, those in BCOs. Training includes loan identification,
appraisal and supervision. Currently, SBS and the BBs are in a state of
transformation following the enactment of the Federal Banking Law in 1978,
which gave the BBs considerable independence. Training has not, until
recently, been seriously addressed. Commissions (or committees) have now
been established to improve cooperation with the BBs, including combined
training activities. An official training organization to cover all SBSs'
needs is soon to be established. SBS is preparing a three-year training
program which will include, inter-alia, all aspects of loan appraisal,
supervision, and evaluation. A team has been charged with visiting BBs,
Investors, and Sub-borrowers, and preparing a paper identifying current
appraisal, supervision, and evaluation weaknesses.
4.32     While the current training programs and field supervision systems
of SBS' Agroindustrial and Forestry Department are not entirely satis-
factory, the situation has improved significantly in the last two years.
Within the Department, the loan appraisal team with special individual
sector responsibilities has recently been strengthened to include an
economist, an engineer, and an agronomist. The new Director is steadily
changing staff attitudes, improving their skills and, through wider staff
participation in the decision making process, improving their readiness and
capacity to accept responsibility. SBS would submit to IBRD before
December 31, 1981 for review and comment, a comprehensive training and
staff improvement program. Assurances were obtained during negotiations,
that SBS would implement the program.
H.  Accounts and Audit
4.33     SBS would maintain separate project accounts for subloan disburse-
ments. Assurances were be obtained during negotiations, that: (a) SBS
would have the Social Accounting Service of Yugoslavia (SDK) audit the
accounts according to internationally accepted standards; and (b) would
submit the audited accounts to IBRD within 6 months of the close of each
fiscal year. Assurances were also be obtained that the auditors would give
a separate opinion as to whether satisfactory procedures are in operation



- 39 -
to ensure that SOE supported withdrawals (para. 3.20) have been used for
the correct purpose. These procedures, practised under existing World Bank
loans, have proved satisfactory.
I. Reporting, Monitoring and Evaluation
4.34     SBS would monitor project implementation through field supervision
of subprojects and through key indicators such as: the number of sub-
projects under preparation, subloan approvals, and the status of commit-
ments, disbursements, loan recoveries, repayment rescheduling, and field
supervision. These procedures, implemented under existing World Bank
loans, have proved satisfactory. SBS would make quarterly progress reports
similar to those made in other Bank financed, Yugoslav and Macedonian proj-
ects (Table 6, page 26). The progress report format would be adapted to
accommodate any special features of the proposed project.
4.35     SBS would continuously evaluate the impact of investments made
under the project. It would collect and analyze data on costs, benefits,
and financial viability of main investments on the basis of suitable
sampling. To help prepare the annual evaluation reports, assurances were
obtained that SBS would, by December 31, 1981, engage qualified and
experienced consultants to design and carry out a monitoring and evaluation
system in accordance with agreed terms of reference satisfactory to the
Bank. The first of the annual evaluation reports would be prepared by June
30, 1983. The portion of the evaluation reports which deal with the pilot
biogas plant would also be made available to other interested agricultural
organizations in Yugoslavia. The total cost of the evaluation system over
an eight-year development period for this project is estimated to be
U$300,000 (constant prices). This cost would be borne by SBS. A similar
evaluation system has been established for several previous Bank-financed
agriculture projects in Yugoslavia (Loans 1129-YU, 1477-YU, 1621-YU and
1801-YU), but this would be the first undertaken by SBS and focussing on
Macedonia.
4.36     Annual evaluation reports would be submitted by SBS to the Bank.
These reports would help SBS with ongoing subproject appraisal and loan
approvals and supervision, as well as with project completion report prep-
aration. SBS would prepare a project completion report not later than
6 months after the closing date. Assurances were obtained from SBS that
it would: (a) follow the monitoring and evaluation procedures outlined;
(b) submit to the Bank quarterly progress reports; (c) produce annual
evaluation reports; and (d) prepare a project completion report.

J. Cost Recovery
4.37     Irrigation operating and maintenance, debt service and replacement
costs would be recovered from water users through charges levied according
to crops grown (para. 4.22). The water charges would, as with other
Bank-financed irrigation projects in Yugoslavia, be based on 'an ability to
pay' and are, in most cases, expected to cover full operation and
maintenance costs and most debt service amortization. All other project
costs, including those for the feasibility study and the pilot biogas
plants would be recovered through loan debt servicing (para. 4.12).
V. PRODUCTION, PRICES, MARKETS AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES
A. Production
5.00     Through investments in livestock, horticulture, irrigation and
mechanization, farmers would be able to intensify production, raise yields
and shift to higher value activities. The total annual value of
incremental output of primary agricultural commodities is estimated at
US$63M at economic prices in 1980 constant terms. 1/
Crop Production
Under the project, about 10,000 ha of land would either be newly
irrigated or existing irrigation would be greatly improved as to water
quantity and reliability of supply. In parallel to this, some 5,500 ha of
new vineyards and orchards would be established, some on the newly
irrigated land, some on other land. Overall, the change in Macedonia's
aggregate cropping as a result of the project is estimated as follows:
Increase in Irrigated Cropping                 ha
Vineyards                                   2,700
Orchards                                    2,800
Cereals                                     2,360
Intensive Crops                               930
Forage Crops                                2,630 1/
Total Newly Irrigated Area                 10,000
1/ Total land area irrigated is 10,000 ha, but an estimated 1,420 ha would
be dou)ble cToppe6 koTaSe                      >        a, total cropped
area of 11,420 ha.



- 41 -
This would result in a reduction of dry land cropping, estimated as follows;
Reduction in Dry Land Cropping
Old Vineyards and Orchards                    700
Cereals                                     7,500
Intensive Crops                               900
Hay/Pasture/Forage Crops                      900
Total                                      10,000
As a result of these changes, increased production is projected as follows;
Table 8: CROPS: INCREMENTAL PRODUCTION AT FULL DEVELOPMENT
Incremental
Production
(tons/year)
Grapes                                                      47,500
Fruits                                                      63,600

/1 Excludes incremental fodder from dairy and sheep models as this is
reflected in the increased livestock production.
Incremental livestock production stemming from the intensified
sheep and dairy farms and the new broiler and pig units would be as follows:
Incremental Production at Full Development
(tons/year)
Milk                                            3,800
Beef (l.w.g.)                                      190
Sheep meat (l.w.g.)                               720
Wool                                                70
Broilers (l.w.g.)                               1,020
Pigs (l.w.g.)                                   1,060
Others
Other project output would include: (i) the value added from
operating about 15,000 tons capacity of cold storage; (ii) the value added
from operating 1[50 tobacco driers (total capacity 2,150 tons leaf input);
and (iii) timber from the 300 ha poplar plantation and the logging demon-
stration area (yielding a total of 550,000 m3 over a 20-year period).
Furthermore, on--farm cost savings and improved outputs would be achieved as
a result of mechanization investments in 200 tractors and farm machinery
a_ _ s .

These production estimates are based on existing marketing oppor-
tunities, and the product mix as foreseen at appraisal. They are subject
to variation with changing market and economic conditions. Based on cur-
rent indications, any likely changes would not significantly affect project
output or viability. Yield assumptions used in estimating project output
are given in Table 9, page 42. These assumptions are based on: (a)
research results; (b) yields obtained currently by social sector orchards

B. Marketing and Market Prospects

analyzed in detail. The analysis shows that satisfactory opportunities
exist for the expected incremental production, although in the case of some
fttLts real prices are likely to fall over time.

Fruit (excluding grapes/wine)
5.02     Due largely to its Mediterranean climate, Macedonia is a major
supplier of fruit and fruit products to the rest of Yugoslavia. In 1976-78
Macedonia provided an average of 33,000 tons annually to other Republics
(29% of Macedonian production). This amount has been projected to increase
to about 100,000 tons annually by 1990. Because of this, the market for
the project's incremental production of around 64,000 tons is considered to
be Yugoslavia as a whole rather than Macedonia. Well developed marketing
channels exist for Macedonian products to other Yugoslav Republics and no
physical problens are anticipated in handling the increased output.

5.03     As a result of the rapid increase in plantings in recent years and
taking account of those planned in the near future, production of most
fruits in Yugoslavia is expected to grow at a greater rate than demand (at
constant prices). This is shown in Table 10 (page 44), which compares
projected supplies and demand for Yugoslavia (including Macedonia) for 1985
and 1990. However, as shown in Table 11, present per capita consumption
for fruits in Yugoslavia is relatively low compared with most other
Mediterranean fruit producing countries. In aggregate, the 1976/8-1990
increase in Yugoslav fruit consumption required to clear the market is
about 18% high,er than the figure which, ceteris paribus, would result from
the likely growth in per capita income and population; however, with
appropriate price adjustments, this would be feasible. Nonetheless, with
certain fruits, the likely level of price reduction would be such as to
make new planting of them uneconomic, although generally, it would be both
financially and economically worthwhile to continue producing from estab-
lished orchardls.

Grapes and Wine
5.04     Macedonian grape production increased by about 40% between 1970
and 1978 whereas the total Yugoslav increase was only 5%. By 1978
Macedonia's share of national production had risen to 20% and, by 1990, is
projected to increase to around 27%. By 1990, Macedonia would provide
about 100,000 tons of grapes (24% of SRM production) to other Yugoslav
Republics, compared to 26,000 tons (11% of SRM production) in 1976-78.
Wine production has also shown significant growth in Macedonia. Between
1970 and 1978 it grew by 64% compared to 8% in Yugoslavia. Over the same
period Macedonia's share of Yugoslav production has increased from 10% to
over 15%, and is expected to increase to around 20% by 1990. Currently,
Macedonia ships around 670,000 hl of wine to other regions or for export;
this is projected to grow to about 1,200,000 hl by 1990. About 10% of
Macedonian wine is currently exported, mainly to Europe. With the EC
expansion to include three wine surplus countries, Yugoslav exports are
unlikely to increase over the next decade, although marketing strategy
dictates that the proportion of premium wines exported should increase at
the expense of bulk wines. An aggregate supply/demand analysis for grapes
indicates there should be no difficulty in absorbing within Yugoslavia
the incremental project production of around 48,000 tons annually (see
Table 10).
Meat
5.05     Macedonia's 1977 meat consumption of 53,000 tons 1/, which was
about 11,000 tons higher than production, is estimated to grow to about
85,000 tons by 1990. Currently, poultry meat supply is virtually in
balance, mutton shows a slight surplus, while substantial shortages of beef
and pig meat exist. Total incremental project production of beef, poultry
and pork, and part of the incremental sheep meat production (equivalent in
total to about 5% of Macedonia's present consumption) would be consumed
within the Republic. In addition to local demand, good prospects exist for
lamb exports to Middle East countries and Italy and part of the incremental
lamb production would be exported. Adequate slaughtering and distribution
facilities exist to handle the projected livestock production increases.
Milk
5.06     Because of supply shortages, current Macedonian per capita milk
consumption of around 121 liters equivalent 2/ is only 67% of the national
level (fresh milk per capita consumption of about 57 liters is only 59% of
that of Yugoslavia). However, this is forecasted to increase to about 148
1/ Current Macedonian per capita meat consumption is 29 kg compared to all
of Yugoslavia 50 kg, Romania 53 kg, Hungary 81 kg, and EC-9 75 kg.

liters equivalent (by 22%) by 1990. Livestock production is unlikely to
grow sufficiently to match this, and an increase in the proportion supplied
by other Repub'lics is expected. At full production in 1990, the project
would produce about 3,770 tons of milk annually for local consumption. Of
this, 28% would be sheep milk, largely used for cheese making. Total proj-
ect milk production would amount to only 1-2% of projected 1990 Macedonian
demand and so would be readily absorbed locally. Milk processing and
collection facilities are being expanded with IBRD support and should be
adequate to handle the projected incremental output.
Tobacco
5.07     Macedonia accounts for over 40% of Yugoslav fermented tobacco
production. T'he proposed project includes construction of 150 mini-tobacco
driers each with 3 tons dried tobacco capacity; a total of 450 tons of
dried tobacco or 2,150 tons of fermented tobacco. Production of fermented
tobacco is expected to increase by 8,000 tons between 1980 and 1985. Addi-
tional drying capacity would be provided from mini-driers financed under
the Third Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1801). The concept of con-
structing mini-tobacco drying houses in the yards of individual farmers in
preference to constructing large-scale, common tobacco drying houses is
sound from the marketing point of view, in that it improves tobacco
quality, reduces transport costs and provides greater monetary reward to
the individual producer. Such quality improvement would enhance the
marketability of Macedonian tobacco.
Forestry
5.08     Yugos'lavia has long been a net exporter of round wood and other
forest products, principally to Europe. In 1977, forest products con-
stituted about 1% (US$69 M) of export value. A strong demand exists for
forest products in Europe (over 17 million cubic meters of round wood and
US$4.9 billion of forest products were imported in 1977) and, with exten-
sive forest resources and well established forest industries, Yugoslavia is
well placed geographically to supply this market. The marked imbalance in
broad-leaved and coniferous forests, however, has resulted in Macedonia
needing to import some 50,000 cubic meters of soft wood timber annually.
The actual demand for wood and wood products in Macedonia far exceeds pro-
duction and no difficulty is expected in marketing incremental forest
output.
C. Prices
5.09     Financial prices used for project appraisal are based on farmgate
prices for primary products and ex-factory wholesale prices of processed
products in June 1980 and are shown in Annex 3, Table T-1. June 1980
input/output prices have been used due to uncertainties created by the June
1980 devaluation and consequent distortions caused in input/output price
ratios as a price freeze was selectively lifted. June 1980 investment



- 48 -
costs have, for financial evaluation of investment models, been adjusted
upwards to include the direct effect on foreign exchange costs, in Dinar
terms, of the 35% Dinar devaluation. Extensive sensitivity analysis has
been applied to all financial rates of return to determine the effects of
possible distortions created by the economic stabilization measures
recently instituted by Republic and Federal Governments. Details of these
are shown in Annex 3, Table T-5. Each investment would be subjected to
financial analysis based on prevailing input/output prices. Thus distor-
tions resulting from the current price uncertainties should be largely
removed.
D. Financial Analysis
Livestock Production and Horticulture Projection
5.10     The financial analysis has been made through representative models
for each investment type to be financed under the project. Actual invest-
ments may differ from the models since: (a) they would be of different
sizes and local conditions may vary; and (b) the investment mix would vary
according to market conditions and sub-borrower demand, which itself would
be much influenced by prevailing financial and economic conditions. The
underlying assumptions for changes in cropping patterns, yields and input
requirements, are presented in Annex 3, Tables T-3 and T-4 and are based on
interviews with farmers, operational experience under similar Bank financed
agricultural projects in Macedonia and from SBS' extensive records. The
financial rates of return (FRR) vary between 6% and 49% and are presented
in Annex 3, Table T-5. Two aspects of the methodology used have tended to
distort the FRR: (a) an upward adjustment, due to devaluation, of the June
1980 investment estimates without any change in input/output prices; and
(b) output prices are held constant over time which tends to reduce the FRR
for livestock models whose output prices are expected to increase over
time, but to increase the FRR for fruit for which a downward pressure on
prices would generally be expected. Also individual model incremental
benefits have been phased to adequately reflect the time lag between making
investments and receiving benefits. Details of investment models are shown
in Working Papers C-6 cold storage, C-7 social sector orchard and vine-
yards, C-8 individual sector livestock, C-9 individual sector vegetable
(plastic house), fruit, tobacco drier and machinery, C-10 irrigation, and
C-Il forestry.
Irrigation
5.11     Financial analysis of the small scale irrigation schemes to be
financed under the project have been based on appraisal of two models: one
for gravity irrigation and one using pumped water. Key assumptions relat-
ing to technical features and cropping patterns are given in Working Paper
C-10.  Based oa these assumptions the YRR ior the irrigation sste  is
estimated to be 15%.

VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Benefits
6.00     The project investments are designed to accelerate growth of the
Macedonian economy through the development of agriculture - the sector
which contains the poorest and least developed segments of the population.
Project benefits would derive from: (a) improved productivity and incomes
of individual farmers through investments in livestock and horticulture
production and machinery in which the individual farmers have a comparative
advantage due to the labor intensity of the operations (para. 3.09); (b)
increased employment opportunities created through expansion of social
sector activities in farming, forestry, cold stores, and irrigation (paras
3.02, 3.03, 3.04); (c) indirect expansion of employment due to increased
agricultural production and reduction of under employment on individual
farms; (d) increased production of meat, milk, fruit, grapes, and vege-
tables to meet increasing agro-industry raw material requirements and
consumer demand for food products; although not substantial, some increase
in foreign exclaange earnings; (e) reduction of forestry, milk and other
agricultural imports into the Republic (paras. 5.04, 5.05, 5.07); (f)
strengthening the development institutions in the project area (paras.
4.20-4.28, 4.32); and (g) contributing towards providing alternative energy
sources in agriculture (paras. 3.10, 3.11). The returns to the economy
from project investments are expected to be substantial and the overall
economic rate of return (ERR) has been estimated at 17%.
6.01     About 6,000 individual farm families (30,000 persons) would bene-
fit directly from the irrigation component of the project, some of whom
would also be included among the 3,000 families (15,000 persons) who
would receive subloans for livestock, horticulture, tobacco driers, and
machinery. Thie net result would be that about 7,000 different families in
the individual sector would benefit directly from the project. About 25%
of direct beneficiaries are expected to belong to a target group with per
capita incomes below US$530. The incomes of direct beneficiaries are
expected to increase by 70% to 200% as compared to without project
incomes. Indirect beneficiaries in social sector agro-processing, market-
ing, distribution, and in the farm service sector (credit, input supplies,
transport, extiension) would be at least double the number of direct bene-
ficiaries.
6.02     The project's contribution to employment would be important.  At
full development, the project investments would create the equivalent of
about 4,300 full time jobs in agriculture. About a third of this extra
manpower requirement would be for seasonal labor for fruit and grapes
harvest; about 40% would be increased family labor requirements on partici-
pating farms, which would reduce underemployment and pressure to migrate
from the project area; and the remainder would be full-time jobs in the
social sector. During construction, the equivalent over 6 years of about



- 50 -
3,000 seasonal jobs would also be created. Furthermore, additional employ-
ment of about 1,000 jobs would be created in the supply and marketing
subsectors.
6.03     Most of the incremental production would be used to satisfy
domestic consumption needs. Part of the incremental output however, valued
at about US$5 million annually (compared to US$63 M total annual incre-
mental output) could be exported, resulting in increased foreign exchange
earnings - one of Yugoslavia's highest ranking needs.
6.04     The project's non-quantifiable benefits would include:  (a) the
improved institutional development of SBS and other participating organiza-
tions through training and through experience gained in preparing, imple-
menting and evaluating development projects; and (b) fostering of increased
cooperation between the individual and social sectors through the indivi-
dual sector credit program, the irrigation component and through the
expansion of market opportunities.
B. Economic Evaluation
Economic Prices
6.05     Project economic evaluation is based on constant June 1980 prices,
and the pre-devaluation exchange rate of US$l = Din. 20 is used to convert
internationally traded commodity prices into Dinars. Accordingly, standard
conversion factors appropriate to the pre-devaluation situation are used;
the standard conversion factor applied to the local cost component of non-
tradeables being 0.7. Economic prices for tradeable project outputs of
meat and grain are based on World Bank Commodity Division forecasts, while
the prices of non-tradeables are based on the local price modified by a
consumption conversion factor. Most fruits to be produced under the proj-
ect are traded internationally by Yugoslavia, but only in small quantities
(less than 2% of production in unprocessed form). Exports are likely to be
effectively restricted to about their present levels and thus, at the
margin, incremental production would be largely consumed in the Yugoslav
market. For analytical purposes, therefore, fruits are treated as non-
tradeables, and their 1980 economic prices are taken as the 1980 financial
prices modified by an appropriate conversion factor. Exogenous forecasts
of supply for project fruits (all of which are tree crops) have been made
and are compared with domestic demand estimates for 1985 and 1990. Pro-
jected economic prices are then set at levels which would equalize the
domestic supply/demand relationship. This is the worst case situation.
Since treating the domestic market as the sole market for increased produc-
tion would have a greater downward effect on estimates of farmgate prices
than if a blend of domestic and export market demand elasticities were
used. Beyond 1990, prices are assumed to remain constant. Details of
eAwzaX ece~womIc. Vt~vice derivations are shown in Working Paper C-2.  Key
economic prices are shown in Annex 3, Table T-2.



- 51 -
Cost and Benefit Streams
6.06     Economic evaluation has been done using Internal Economic Rate of
Return (ERR) and Net Present Value (NPV) estimation. Quantifiable project
benefits would be: (i) total project incremental agricultural production;
(ii) costs saved/income generated from mechanization; (iii) value added by
tobacco barns and cold stores; (iv) poplar wood production; and (v) incre-
mental sales resulting from the timber extraction component. Total incre-
mental production is given in para 5.00. Forecasts of incremental benefits
(and costs) are based on present levels of technology, thus it is
implicitly asumed that improvements in yields due to non-project factors
would be the same with the project as without the project. Costs quanti-
fied include all capital and operating costs, excluding price contingencies
and transfer payments such as taxes and subsidies, but including physical
contingencies. To take into account within year timing differences between
benefits and costs for annual crops, benefits from such crops have been
lagged by half a year on average. Neither the costs nor benefits of the
Biogas or Feasibility Study components of the project are included in proj-
ect analysis. In addition to the direct component costs, the estimated
economic cost of SBS' incremental workload resulting from the project are
also included.
Sensitivity Analysis
6.07     Sensitivity analysis has been done on individual project com-
ponents (Annex 3, Tables T-6) and on the total project (Table 12, page
52). With the exception of the social sector plum model, all subprojects
show an ERR above the estimated opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The
aggregate result (ERR 17%) indicates that the project is economically
viable. Even raising the shadow wage rate to the standard conversion
factor (the level at which the economic marginal value product of labor
producing non-tradeables equals its cost) the ERR would only fall to
14.5%. Furthermore, the project is insensitive to wider changes in the
estimated standard conversion factor--raising the SCF to 0.9 would increase
the ERR to 19%, while reducing it to 0.6 would give an ERR of 16%. Switch-
ing values on capital investment costs, operating costs (excluding labor),
labor costs (including family labor) and benefits have been calculated and
are shown in Table 12.

/1  Based on an Opportunity Cost of Capital (OCC) of 12%.
Overall, the project is sound, but it is moderately vulnerable to changes
in benefits, particularly under the assumption of a 12% OCC. In that case,
a reduction in benefits of 15%, ceteris paribus, would reduce the ERR to
the OCC. Switching values on investment costs, operating costs, and labor
are large, indicating the substantial change in these economic streams
could occur and the project still remain viable.
C. Risk and Uncertainty
6.08     The project institutional arrangements would continue those used
for previous Bank loans in Macedonia, and are generally satisfactory. All
first year sub-projects including individual sector sub-projects, cold
storage, irrigation, and forestry have been identified and, for social
sector orchards and vineyards, some have commenced prior to project
approval. No substantial procurement delays are expected, due to the
flexibility incorporated in paras. 3.19-3.23 and to the experience SBS now
has wit tSTt 'AtcU&'ces.  Am imprtant risk is the
possibility of restrained farmer response for some investments, due to



- 53 -
possible changes in input/output ratios following recent major structural
adjustments, including devaluation, in the Yugoslav economy. These will
have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis as new price ratios develop.
The detailed identification of sub-borrowers done so far should reduce
these uncertainties. However, the commitment rate of individual sector
sub-loans under previous projects has not been satisfactory. There is the
possibility that, in future, this rate will not increase sufficiently to
commit in the time available all funds under this loan and already avail-
able under previous loans. Steps have been taken through appraisal which
should improve the pace of project implementation and reduce the risk to an
acceptable level.
6.09     Marketing presents some uncertainties.  The internal market
analysis has been thorough. Questions exist about the market potential for
certain fruits (sour cherries, peaches, apricots); this will require some
flexibility, careful market analysis, and close monitoring during imple-
mentation. The marketing risk also includes the potential problems caused
by the lack of coordination in investments in other Republics and in
Provinces which could result in oversupply of some commodities (para.
1.14). Some changes in product mix may be necessary, pending the outcome
of the on-going Agro-Industry Study. In aggregate, the increased supply of
fruits is expected to be easily absorbed by the domestic market, but at
lower prices (economic analysis of the project reflects this). Further-
more, the financial values of most project fruits are 5-8 times the picking
costs; thus, it is unlikely that output would be significantly reduced by
unharvested produce, even if prices do fall substantially in some years.
6.10     Availability of adequate local counterpart investment funds also
poses some risk. Current financial and economic problems as well as the
stabilization measures being implemented to correct them by Yugoslav and
Macedonian authorities are likely to result in less investment finance
being available for local costs. Assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions on the availability and sources of project financing.
6.11     These! uncertainties are minimized through the proposed project
design, the assurances obtained from the borrower, and the continuing
dialogue with the Macedonian authorities on project related issues. Con-
sidering the potential benefits, both direct and indirect, to the economy
and individuals, these are acceptable and prudent risks.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
Conditions For Project Effectiveness
7.00     The agreement among SBS, its basic banks and other relevant
republic organizations related to the provision of funds to the individual
sector has been concluded in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank.



- 54 -
General Conditions
7.01     During negotiations, assurances were obtained from SBS that it
would:
(i) implement the project as described in paras. 3.02 through 3.11;
(ii) restrict the areas to be planted and financed under the project so
as not to exceed, unless otherwise agreed with the Bank on the
basis of an updated market analysis: total fruits in both the
individual and social sectors to 2,800 ha, including apricots
100 ha, sour cherries 50 ha and peaches 100 ha (paras. 3.02 and
3.09);
(iii)  by December 31, 1981, employ suitably qualified consultants to
carry out the feasibility study for thermal water developments
(para. 3.11);
(iv)  follow the financing and disbursement procedures outlined in
paras. 3.15, 3.17 and 3.18;
(v)  follow the procurement procedures outlined in paras. 3.19 through
3.21;
(vi) continue to maintain and adequately staff the Agro-industries and
Forestry Department to carry out its responsibilities under the
project (paras. 4.09, 4.31 and 4.32);
(vii) follow the lending procedures and terms and conditions described
in paras. 4.11 through 4.18;
(viii)  for individual sector sub-loans, charge one blended interest rate
to sub-borrowers (para 4.16);
(ix) for irrigation sub-projects costing more than US$5.0M equivalent,
prepare appraisal reports as described in para. 4.12;
(x) follow the auditing, accounting, and progress reporting require-
ments described in paras. 4.33 and 4.34 through 4.36; and
(xi) by December 31, 1981, employ consultants, satisfactory to the Bank
and on the basis of agreed terms of reference, to continually
evaluate the impact of project investments (para. 4.35).
7.02     Subject to the above assurances and conditions the project would
be suitable for a Bank loan of US$80 million equivalent for a term of 15
years, including a 3-year grace period.

Footnotes to Table T-2
/1        Based on June 1980 exchange rate of US$1.00 = Din. 20.
/2        Treated as non-tradeables with marginal consumption being domestic -
movement over time relates to supply/demand position on Yugoslav
market except for sour cherries for which exports are also considered
price elastic.
/3        Based on import parity for wheat and export parity for maize and barley
using adjusted WB international price projections.
/4        Based on WB price projections and Yugoslav premium with relation to
these. Proportional price relationship between different types of
stock as on the domestic market.
/5        Based on present unit export prices, assuming that sheep meat on the
world market increases in real terms by 25% 1981-1990 (compared with
44% for cattle and 39% for pigs). Proportional price relationships
between different types of stock as on the domestic market.
/6        Based on Macedonia importing pigs, at the margin from Romania as an
alternative to expanding production. Prices are projected to increase
in line with a world concentrate feed price index calculated from WB
Commodity Division price forecasts for maize and soybean meal.
Weaners (piglets) are valued at a premium of 40% per kg above fat pig
prices as in the past.
/7        Based on the alternative of importing from the USA - a major wore.   :-r
of broilers.  Prices are projected to increase in line with a worl,
concentrate price index.
/8        Based on WB projections of world prices modified by the local economic
cost of compounding and distribution.
/9        Based on WB international price projections of main inputs (maize,
soybean moeal, sunflower pellets and barley) adjusted for local economic
costs of transport, compounding and bagging.
/10        Taken at 40% of the wage rate for unskilled labor of Din. 220 per day.

SMALL-SCALE IRRIGATION SCHEMES
1.       System Gostivar - This existing system located on a lateral intake
from the Vardar River, is currently served by a 15 km long main canal. It
will be reconstructed to provide underground distribution pipe network,
about 160 km in length. Irrigation will be through furrows and will cover
an existing area of about 4,500 ha.
2.       System Tetovo-Bistrica - The existing system located on a 26 km
long main canal, emnating from the Vardar River, will be reconstructed
through provision of about 130 km of underground distribution pipe network;
irrigation in an existing area of about 3,650 ha will be through furrows.
3.       System Celopecko-Kicevo-Gresinea - The existing system is served
by an offtake from the Treska River, a tributary of the Vardar. The pro-
posed project will consist of reconstruction of the main supply canal in a
length of about 8.5 km and underground distribution pipe network in a
length of about 40 km. It will include about 400 ha of the existing
Celopecko system and about 644 ha from the proposed Gresinca Project.
Irrigation will be performed by furrows.
4.       System Malesevo-Berovo - The existing irrigation system is served
from the Males Reservoir on the Retevska River. Under the proposed project
reconstruction and extension works will consist of a main pipeline about
7.0 km long, and underground distribution network, in a length of about 100
km, for irrigating about 917 ha by furrows and sprinklers.
5.       System Mezdra - The proposed project will include construction of
a dam on the Mcravica River to conserve about 3.5 Mm3 of water which will
irrigate about 1,225 ha by sprinklers and also provide domestic water
supply to the town of Sveti Nikole. Other project works will consist of
about 2.5 km of main pipeline and about 44 km of underground distribution
pipe network.
6.       System Udovo.  The existing system is served by pumping from the
Vardar River. The proposed project will include a dam for storing 1.0
Mm3 on Anska Reka, a tributary of the Vardar River and construction of
main and secondary underground distribution pipelines in a length of about
10 km for irrigating about 272 ha by furrows.
7.       System Kumanovo (Sub-systems Rudo Pole (50 ha); Vojnik (50 ha);
and Golem Rid (550 ha). A part of the Kumanovo plain will be irrigated
through construction of pumping station on the River Pcinja - and an
underground distribution pipe network, about 24 km in length. A total area
of 650 ha will be irrigated by sprinklers.
