APPRAISAL OF DAWOOD HERCULES CHEMICALS LIMITED
UREiA PRO;;CT AND UGN  -tAL PROSPECTS FGUK-
NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS IN WEST PAKISTAN
I. INTRODUCTION
1         IBRD and IFC have been asked to join the financing of a 3h5,00()
tons-/ per year capacity urea fertilizer project jointly sponsored by the
Dawood industrial group (Dawood) of Pakistan and Hercules Incorporated
(Hercules) of the U.S.A. A new company, Dawood Hercules Chemicals Limited
(DH Chemicals), has been formed to carry out the project which consists of
a plant with daily capacities of 620 tons of amnonia and 1,100 tons of
urea, at Chichoki Mallian, Sheikhupura District, West Pakistan, using as
feedstock, natural gas available from the Sui gas field.
2.        The total project cost is estimated at $78.2 million, including
provisions for working capital of $2.6 million, of which the foreign ex-
change comDonent would be $W6.6 million. It is proposed that IBRD and rPC
would participate in the financing of DH Chemicals for the amount of $34h9
million, comprisine an IBRD loan of $32.0 million and an IFC eauitv invest-
ment of $2.9 million.  In addition, a contingent IFC commitment of up to
$1.0 million would be made in the form of a shareholders loan if needed t'o
finance project cost overrun. The balance of the financing would be pro--
vided throuigh shnre suhbscription by the  pqonsors and the   q.Pqkisfni public;
rupee loans from the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) and
3.        TRRD and IFG were f4-st asked by the sponsors to assist in the
financing of the project in November 1966 and, since then, IBRD and IFC
I.e vat - hse t with the sponsors on sever0l  -ocasions to d.rw up a f-nar-
cial plan and to discuss various aspects of the project. The sponsors'
feasibJiliUy s tULU .d tWUL11,cal assessment h1ad Lbieen prepared witL the help
of two U.S. engineering firms, Bechtel Corporation and Fluor Corporation.
A separate study on the market prospects of the project was also conducted
by a Hercules mission.  In July 1967, the Hercules Bcard decided to pro-
ceeu with ibs participation in the project, based upon the above surveys.
On August 29, 1967, the National Economic Council of Pakistan gave its
approval of the project and, subsequently, on November 4, i967, an official
letter of sanction from the Government, describing its detailed terms and
conditions, was issued.  In April 1968, DH Chemicals was incorporated in
Karachi by the sponsors.
1/ Reference in this report is to metric tons unless otherwise indicated.
This report was prepared by Messrs. Williamson and Hori on the basis of
IFC's discussions with the sponsors (held both in Washington and Wilmington),
and the findings of the IFC technical appraisal mission (Mr. Ewing of IFC
Engineering Department) which visited Pakistan in January 1968.

III. THE COMPANY
5.         In April 1968, a new limited company, Dawood Hercules Chemicals
Limited, with an authorized capital of Rs 250 million (approximately $52.15
million) was set up in Karachi to construct and operate the proposed urea
plant and would have a paid-in capital of Rs 139 million (approximately
$29.2 million), of which Dawood and Hercules would each contribute 40%, and
IFC and the Pakistani public 10% each.
6.        The by-laws of DH Chemicals would provide both patners with veto
power over Board decision. Dawood and Hercules would each appoint an equal
number of directors (L), who collectively constitute 80% of the Board and
all Board decisions would require a simple majority vote plus one additional
vote for anproval.   At shareholders' meetings. a vote of at least two-
thirds of the total issued and paid-up capital would be needed for the

panies.  Hercules has been engaged in ammonia synthesis since 1939 and in
the manufacture of urea since 1960.  Currently, Hercules operates three
ammonia plants (total capacity of about 500 short tons per day) and three
urea plants (total capacity of about 205 short tons per day) in tne u.S...
It also has a substantial experience in methanol production, the techno-
logy of which is similar to ammonia manufacture.   Hercules is now buildilng
an 800 short tons per day methanol plant at Planquemines, Louisiana.
Wnile it appears that Hercules has comparatively limited experience with
modern ammonia technology, IFC believes that Hercules is technically com-
petent in general chemical plant construction and engineering, and is there-
fore capable of providing necessary technical support to the project with
adequate design and engineering support.



13.       As of December 31, 1967, Hercules had a net worth of $356 millionn,
represented by $20 million in common and preferred stock and $336 million
in surplus. For financial year 1967, it recorded net sales and operating
revenue of $642 million with a net income after taxes of $47 million, re-
turning 13% on equity.
14.        Hercules will acquire 40%, equivalent at present exchange rate
to $11.7 million, of DH Chemicals' equity. Hercules will also provide
full technical assistance to the project, which includes supervision of
process design and construction, assistance in starting up and operating
the plant. Besides the general manager, Hercules will provide a start-up
team of ten men for up to one year and 18 technical staff members for
plant supervision for three years after the start of commercial operation.
Hercules' technical services will be provided on a no-profit, no-loss
basis. In addition, Hercules will receive, for the technical data and
information it will offer to DH Chemicals. an annual know-how fee of
$300,000 for the first five years of operation. The remuneration to Her-
cules for these services is considered to be reasonable.

Cost of the Project
19.       The total investment cost of the project is estimated at $78.2
million, including a provision of $2.6 million for permanent working
capital at project completion date. Foreign exchange requirements are
approximately 60% of total cost.
20.       The cost, which is set out in more detail in Attachment 1, is
summarized as follows (in US$ '000):

3.        DH Chnemicals will be capitalized with share capital or Rs 139.(
million (approximately $29.2 million) which represents slightly less than
40% of the total long-term funds.  Hercules and Dawood will each contribute
Rs 55.6 million (approximately $11.7 million) to own 40% of DH Chemicals'
voting stock.  mhe remain-Ing 20% of the total equity will be contributed
equally by IFC and the Pakistani public. The public issue will be made in
1971/72 and will be underwritten by Dawood, whose commitment will be guar-
anteed by the Habib Bank, Karachi. Dawood will receive a 2-1/2% commission
for the underwriting of the public issue.
24.       The AID loan of $14.2 million in equivalent rupees will carry a
7% interest and be repaid in 14 semi-annual installments after a 42-month
grace period which commences at first loan disbursement, i.e. late 1969.
Customs debentures of $2.8 million will bear an interest rate of 1% above
the central bank rate (currently 5%) and be repayable in six semi-annual
installments after an interest-free grace period of two years which begins
with the import of the dutiable equipment.
25.       No fixed schedule of equity calls are planned beyond the original
call of 5% which is required to make the IBRD loan effective. All other
calls on equity will be made on a pro rata basis to loan draw-down and in
such amounts that eauity paid in will at all times ecual or exceed two-
thirds of total long-term debt outstanding.
Protective Covenants
26.       It is agreed between IBRD and the sponsors (Dawood and Hercules)
that special protective and retici      eovenan.ts w^uld be     iiAeA _n

Hercules and IFC have further agreed that, in the event
that, because of change in the par val-ue of the rupee,
their respective dollar disbursements to pay for their
equity shares would be less than their ccomitment in
terms of dollars, they will lend to DH Chemicals the
unused funds.
(ii) Rupees. Dawood has agreed to assume responsibility
to provide or make arrangements for any rupee funds
needed to complete the project.

(iii) Loans make to DH Chemicals under both of the above
conditions will be subordinated to the IBRD loan and
carry an interest rate of not more than 9% with repay-
ment to be made over five years commen6ing 12 months
after project completion subject to service of the
senior debt and a current ratio test.
(b)  Security for IBRD Loan
The IBRD loan will be secured by a first mortgage and a
floating charge on the assets of DH Chemicals to be shared
equally and ratably with AID. The usual exceptions are
provided to permit securing short-term working capital
loans.
(c)  Restriction on Cash Distribution to Shareholders

VI.  THE MARKET AND MARKETING
The Market
27.       A separate note (Attachment 2) has been prepared by IFC to
assess the market potential for urea in 1W1est Pakistan. IFC has concluded
that, while nitrogenous fertilizer consumption in West Pakistan is still
relatively low, and the past rate of growth in consumption has been lower
than projected for the Third Five-Year Plan, it may be realistically as-
sumed that consumption of nitrogenous fertilizer will grow from 150,000
tons in 1967/68 to some 470,000 tons in 1974/75 or by an average annual
rate of about 20%. The basis for the above assumption is the apparent
success in fertilizer response on the new strains of wheat and rice re-
cently introduced. Assuming the above growth rate, there is justifica-
tion for two additional urea plants of 330-345,000-ton capacity in West
Pakistan. which would allow this Droject and another similar urea plant
to be installed more or less simultaneously.
28.       Current nitrogen fertilizer capacity, expansions under way and
the E-sso urea plant will provide approximately P 6O170,f7nlO tons of nitro-
gen by 1970. While most of this capacity is located geographically in
areas not w     sunited to c-apete economically in the TLhore area, i.-e- tb
planned location of the two plants under consideration by IBRD; there are
possibilitie     that some produ^+ion from   ---s ------ie  wilbesipe
into the proposed DH Chemicals marketing area, especially in the early
years.  This factor has been taken ir,to consideration Iy nU  1-m-ica    anA
based upon their market surveys, should not cause serious disruption in
pricing orprdcin
29.   Te uoveriieiniU hJas been gi-ving considerationJ.U.L   t pL Uti theP
installation of further nitrogenous fertilizer capacity in addition to
the proposed DH Chemicals plant and another simiiar plant in the Lahore
area. These two plants, together with the existing capacity in Pakistan,
should take care of the demand for nitrogen in the early 1970s, ulless
the development of consumption in the next few years should be substan-
tially in excess of what has been projected. Tberefore, consideration of
adding further nitrogen capacity should be deferred at least for a year
and decided in the light of the experience gained with the development of
the market during that period.
30.       The anticipated growth of consumption is dependent on the
Government's pursuing a coordinated policy to stimulate the demand. The
market report comments in detail on the various aspects of such a policy.
Of particular importance is that the Government arrange to provide sub-
stantial quantities of phosphatic fertilizers. Efficient plant utiliza-
tion of nitrogen is dependent upon companion application of phosphatic and
potassic fertilizers. While soil analysis of West Pakistan has not clearly
established a definite potash requirement, however, the need for phosphatic



- 10 -
fertilizer has been definitely confirmed. The Government will also
have to make arrangements for substantially larger rupee funds to provide
the expanded credit needs that arise from the sharply increased volume of
fertilizer consumption.
Marketing
31.       The marketing area of DH Chemicals will be within a 200-mile
radius of the plant site. To provide complete coverage of the marketing
area, DH Chemicals will select 3-500 dealers, including three major dis-
tributors, who, together with their sub-agents, are expected to provide
more than one thousand retail outlets. DH Chemicals will, furthermore.
establish four regional offices and warehouses in Lahore, Peshawar, Sar-
godha and Muiltan to handle off-season inventory build-up and suplnement
the stock carried by distributors.
32.       DH Chemicals will organize a technical service group to promote
the sale of urea througlh instruction to farmers in the proper use of
fertilizers. The group will provide technical service through field and
model fa r     ntrtir      -o1 testng,   ndAvir4Ail cusl     ng  A and  illagec
meetings in the marketing area.
33.       Prior to start-up, the sponsors plan to develop the fertilizer
market through a seedin,g prOgrLM.  11 Government- has agreed to the seeA
ing program and has allocated 40,000 tons annually of N (in various forms)
Irom rv   est r-iLs'an Ag-ic-ultural Deve'lopriLenlt Corporation stocks to Dawoodu
Corporation for distribution over the period of three years from October
1967. The seeding program will be transferred to Dn Chemicals once the
new company is operating. During the current year, 1968/69, Dawood has
proceeded to establish marketing outlets and to date one shipment of
14,000 tons of fertilizer has been successfully marketed.
3h.       The average freight haul of urea is expected to be less than
150 miles. Primary transport will be by trucks and railroad and supple-
mented by bullock carts beyond mandi towns. At present the sponsors
anticipate shipping approximately 50% of urea by trucks because of the
overstrained conditions of the railroad.
35.       The proposed retail price for DH Chemicals' urea is $105 per
ton, which is broken down as follows ($ per ton):
Ex plant price                93.00
Distribution and
transport expenses           12.00
Retail price                  105.00
36.       This compares with the present subsidized retail price of urea
officially fixed at Rs 500 ($105! per long ton and the recent average
price of imported urea of about $105 CIF Karachi. The sponsors believe



that the proposed price level will remain firm for some years to come for
the following reasons:
(a) Increasing knowledge on the part of farmers that the use
of fertilizers is highly profitable.
(b) GOP policy has placed increased agricultural production
as an item of highest priority for future development and
is, therefore, likely to maintain a favorable investment
climate for fertilizer manufacturers.
(c) Pakistan will continue to face a foreign exchange short-
age, thus placing increasing reliance on local manufac-
turers and import substitution.
37.        IFC expects, however, that the downward trend in the world mar-
ket for urea would continue, and by the time DH Chemicals' plant is com-
missioned. the Government will discontinue the oresent subsidv Droeram.
As local competition increases and world market prices decline, the pro-
posed nrice may require adiustment several years after start-up.
38.       Recause of the shortage of fPrti1 ize'r   fnrmerA have tradition-
ally paid cash for fertilizers. However, it will undoubtedly be necessary
for daolersQ andA retaller  toe+edcedta            tlze     os.         i-n-
creases. Such credit will be essentially in the form of crop term credit

VII. PROFITABILITY AND FINANCCIAL POSITION
39.        Cnere are attached a projected income statement, a projected
balance sheet and a cash flow statement, as Annexes 1, 2 and 3, respec-
tively.
40.        Trhe project is expected to be commissioned 36 months after pro-
ject financing is finalized. Hercules assumes that the rate of operation
will gradually rise from 50% of capacity in the first year of operation to
90% in the second year, reaching full capacity in the third year and con-
tinuing thereafter. For the purpose of profitability projections, a
selling price of $93 per ton ex-plant is used for operations. The project
will enjoy a tax holiday through 1975 during which no income tax is pay--
able on net earnings, however, 40% of the tax-free earnings must be
retained and are not available for cash dividends.



- 12 -
41.       Based upon these assumptions, DH Chemicals is expected to show a
nominal net profit in the first year increasing to approximately $12 mil:Lion
(35% of net sales) in the fourth year of operation, however, profits wil:L de-
6line after the tax holiday but net earnings will stabilize at about $7 mil-
lion thereafter. Pre-tax and pre-interest return on total long-tern funds
employed is projected on the average at about 20% per arnum after capacity
operation is achieved. Debt service coverage ratio will exceed two except
during the first few years. On a 100% pay-out basis, DH Chemicals will be
in a position to declare a first dividend in the second year of operation,
increasing to about 20% after the fifty year of operation.
42.       The project has a high proportion of fixed costs, amounting to
40% of the estimated sales price. However, DH Chemicals will be able to
meet its fixed costs at capacity operation as long as sales price does not
drop below $62 per ton or as long as the sales volume does not drop below
196,000 tons per year, which is 57% of capacity.
h3.        The initial debt/eauitv ratio of 62:38 will imorove to approxi-
mately 40:60 by the fifth year of operation when the plant is operating at
capacntynit_  The  rrpnf. ratio will rise from a law of 1.0 in the first year
of operation to 2.9 in the fifth year.
44.       The AID loan fixed maturities will be scheduled over seven years,
to be fully repaid approximnately at the same time as the TBRPD loan.   Howtqever,
DH Chemicals anticipates returning the AID loan in four years by utilizing

respectively, both discounted.
VIII. EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT
46.        On the above basis, the project appears technically feasible and
commercially attractive. Both sponsors are financially responsible and
have extensive industrial management experience. Additionally, Hercules is
expected to provide technical, marketing and industrial management support
to the project. Cash generation, on the basis of projections, appears ade-
quate to assure servicing of the total long-term debt, and projected earn-
ings indicate that the returns on IFC equity would be very satisfactory.
Thus, IBRD looks forward to satisfactory protection on its loan and IFC can
reasonably expect an attractive return on its equity.



- 13 -
47.       ahe project will materially contribute to the econormy of Pakistan
by providing a substantial quantity of urea for increasing agricultural
production and by broadening the industrial base of the country. Since the
project is based upon locally available natural gas, substantial savings in
foreign exchange will result if the current pattern of growth in fertilizer
consumption continues. The project will also provide direct employment for
approximately 600 persons as well as indirect employment for an even largter
number to be required in transport and distribution.
48.       On the whole, the project appears well-conceived and suitable for
IBRD/IFC financing. However, there are several factors which need parti-
cular attention: first, prices of nitrogenous fertilizer may well decline
as the new generation of large ammonia plants come on-stream throughout the
world and, under these circumstances, it is possible that indigenous pro--
ducers would be forced to reduce prices in parallel with international
prices, with a corresponding reduction of the return on investment of DH
Chemicals. Second, even though the sponsors plan to use the latest proven
technology and equipment, and rely on the services of one of the leading
consultant firms as engineering manager, the project may well encounter
start-un troubles as hannened to some of the modern. larae fertilizer
facilities in developed countries built by well-experienced manufacturers.
The scone and magnitude of possible technical problems duiring cnnstruction
and start-up are not easily assessable, however, major problems could lead
to fr   -ial losses.  It is reasonable to assm-e, however, that the possi-
bility of start-up problems should be materially reduced in the next few
years due to increasing ee-rier.ce an.d -no4- gaed in the s+art-1- of
these large plants. A third factor is the critical importance of provision
fLor s-U.Pficien.t4 pbuosphatic fLertui'lizer-Ls to a C-ssure a bal'ncedI -npVut of r".-+
ents. According to the IFC mission, Pakistan must either make provision
for im,port Of approx-lmately 225,000 tons of P205 by 197h or istall local
capacity.  Failure to provide this P205 could seriously handicap the build-
-up of nitrogen use, since the benefits derived from nitrogenous fertilizer
application is dependent upon proper application of phosphatic fertilizers.
49.       IFC has carefully examined these factors and, in its judgment,
ule risks are not unreasonable and fall well wiubin the scope of accepab-le
industrial risks, therefore, no more than normal risks for the IBRD loan or
the IFC investment.

TECMUICAL ArrtAISAL
I.     THE PROJECT
The project consists of the construction in the Lahore area of West
Pakistan of a fertilizer plant to produce 345,000 tons* of agricultural
grade urea per annum. The proposed facilities will include a 620 tons
per day single train ammonia unit and a 1,100 tons per day double train
urea unit. The Kellogg and Toyo total recycle processes will be used
for ammonia and urea manufacture, respectively. All the ammonia would
be utilized in the manufacture of urea. In addition to the usual bagging,
storage, shipping, maintenance, laboratory and administration facilities,
the plant will have its own power station with a capacity of 18,000 kw.
Outside power connections would be maintained for emergency use. Natural
gas from the Sui field would be used as feedstock and fuel. No other raw
material would be required.
Total fixed cost of the project is estimated at $75.6 million of which
about 60% would be required in foreign exchange. When the plant is pro-
ducing at full capacity, annual sales will be about $32 million. Assuming
that the pro-ect would go ahead in mid-1968, mechanical completion of the
plant is expected in late 1971 with full commercial production available
bv mid-1972
Thpe locatIon near Lahore (see mnp - Annex 1) is in the miidst of the
principal agricultural region of kest Pakistan. IFC engineers have in-
spected +he proposed -ite and havee e   ram-nnel nA di cussedA +the technicar-,l
details of the project with the Pakistani and American sponsors.  In

A.   Plant Site
The plant will be iocated at Cnichoki Iviallian, 17 miles west of
Lahore. The site lies in the plain traversed by numerous irrigation
canals between the rivers Cnenab and Ravi, tributarIes of the Indus,
which, with its tributaries, waters the most productive agricultural
area in West Pakistan.
The plant site is on the broad gauge railroad connecting Lahore with
Lyallpur and other principal cities of the region, with a connection to
north-south rail line at Sangla Hill some 40 miles to the westward. It
is planned to ship approximately half the product by rail and the balance
by highway.
Negotiations with the Government on a suitable plot of 260 acres
started last September, and the company has recently been granted access
to the land. Additional land desired for experimental farms and for
possible future expansion will be purchased directly from private land
owners over a period of some years.
The terrain is flat and neighboring sites have a soil bearing pressure
of about 3,000 pounds ner sauare foot.   Soil tests on the plant site itself
have not yet been carried out, but will be made within the next two months.
Some foundatinon niling may be nec.essary for the heavier nlant. items.
The area was flotded in I955 T.hen the River Rati reached 2 flow rate
of 550,000 cusecs.  Danger of future site flooding is much less than in
1955 becauase of n.ew flood    cont-ro  co.s cionsr and d-versi . of the head-
waters of the three southernmost tributaries of the Indus (including the
P ve  Rav-)  to TnA;a. Conu.ltts toM*  LTAA have calcul     the possib-
ility of a Ravi flow of 538,000 cusecs in future at only once in 500 years.

B.   Manufacturing Units
1. Ammonia
Facilities for producing 620 tons of ammonia per day, or
approximately 200,000 tons of ammonia annually in 320 operating
days would be installed. A single train plant is planned,
utilizing centrifugal compressors and other features of the
latest proven technology.

mne amwmrnua plant Iurnisnes bothn aim-m-ronia awnd carbon dioxide
(C02) for the urea plant. W4hen operating on Sui natural gas the
ammonia plant would not normally produce enougn WJ2 for the urea
process.  Hercules propose to use excess natural gas in the re-
forming step and so produce some extra w02-   Some extra hydrogen
would also be produced but this would be recycled and used as
fuel. Hercules (and Fluor, who have done preliminary engineering)
believe this course would be cheaper than recovery from stack
gases, and it is an acceptable method.
Storage for two-and-a-half days production of ammonia
(1,600 tons) would be installed to tide over short outages of
ammonia and urea units.
2.   Urea
It is proposed to install a dual train Toyo Koatsu (Japan)
total recycle plant with a single prill tower producing low biuret
prilled product. The plant is designed to reach capacity (345,000
tons per annum) in 310 operating days producing at 1,110 tons per
day.
A two-train plant was tentatively chosen for two reasons:
first, no one has operating experience with a single train 1,000
ton per day urea plant; secondly, Hercules believe that the added
flexibilitv of the two-train plant would result in sufficient
additional production to justify the added cost, estimated at
M 5-2- Tn llion-

Korea (now reported by Fluor to be making 420 tons per day each),

This is somewhat less costly than storage of- bagged goods.  ThSe

were to be desirable.



C.   Utilities
1.   Water
The ground water of the basin of the Indus and its tributaries
constitutes one of the largest acquifers in the world. The company
therefore plans to obtain its water supply from tube wells. It is
expected that even a long drought would have only a small effect
on the ground water level, and hence the supply of processing water
is assured.
Total cooling water requirements are estimated at 55,000 GPM
which would be circulated through a large cross flow induced draft
cooling tower, and only make-up water would come from tube wells.
Make-up plus boiler feed water plus potable water requirements are
estimated at 2,210 GPM and it is expected that one, or at most,
two wells could handle this requirement. A surge tank would be
provided to tide over well outages of approximately eight hours.
Boiler feed water and Dotable water would be Droduced by
suitable treatment of the well water.
A separate fire main system would be provided.  The basin
of the cooling tower would be made larger t.h2n uimaal nn as to
provide a fire water reservoir good for two hours at 1,500 GPM.
Sewage, both sanitary and from process, would be collected
in treatinp, s,y'J'-TnM   ardi    in acceptable cor,dito  to
the irrigation drain skirting the property. Since some water

this source of power is regarded as not sufficiently dependable
for steaduy ammL,,onia plan.t operati.on.  HenLi, asb .s Uom,m,o prL-ctice,
the factory will have its own power generating facilities. Total
power requirements, including those Of the housing colony, are
estimated at 14,825 kw. It is tentatively planned to install
three 6,000 kw generators, two driven by gas turbines and one by
a steam turbine. Final decision will rest on detailed engineer-
ing and heat balance calculations.
For emergency and stand-by operations, an electricity
connection will be made to the 66 kv transmission line which
runs alongside the plant site. The capital cost estimates
include an in-plant substation for this connection. The factory
under normal conditions may export a little power to the public
system. These arrangements have been tentatively discussed with
the Power Company, but no details have been finalized.



D.   OfIi-s1ites anu
Tne project would have the usual facili ties anc llary to production
in a grass roots installation. Among these are the following.
1. Rail and Highway Connections
Details of the rail connection have not yet been worked out in
detail, but since the plant site is on the broad gauge line connect-
ing Lahore with Lyallpur this presents no great difficulty.
Railroad officials have indicated orally that they would make the
necessary equipment available for moving the urea. While there are
no firm plans yet for sidings, marshalling yard or the like, the
capital cost estimate includes an allowance for 6,000 feet of track
with switches, turn-outs, etc.
The plant site is on the main highway between Lahore and
Lyal1pur. However, the present two lane highway is badly congested.
Government proposes to widen this road to four lanes within the next
five years.
2.   Storage
Since the only raw material to be used is natural gas and this
will also serve as fuel, no storage is needed.
Storage for ammonia (1,600 tons) and urea (74,000 tons) has
already been discussed under the headings of Ammonia and Urea.
Ammonia would be stored at atmospheric pressure in a refrigerated
spherical tank.
The storage buildings for bulk and bagged urea would be ridge-
type concrete structures. Two lines of bagging equipment will be
installed to handle full nroduction on a three shifts per day
schedule plus a spare Line to be put into service as needed. There
would be storage space for six weeks requirements of empty bags.
3.   Maintenanee
lAn nAmmniin1v1ar -nirinnrA1 sqhnn with a store for narts and suDUlies
is planned, together with suitable portable tools and mobile equip-
r.ent. Ample allowance has been made for spare parts. catalysts and
chemicals.
h.   Buildings
Aside from the previously mentioned reinforced concrete
construction to be used for the main storage buildings, the type
of construction for the other plant buildings has not yet been
seleeted.  It is planned to retoin a local architec to Maxn ze



-6-
tihe use of locai. design anQ ma-terials.  About 60,000 square feetu
of floor space are planned for offices, shops, laboratory and the
like. Tnis is an adequate ailowance.
Tne administration building, laboratory and other offices
would be air-conditioned as would the dwellings planned for the
housing colony.
5.   Housing Colony
Although an extensive housing colony at the plant site was
originally visualized, Hercules now believe that adequate dwellings
for expatriates and other staff are available in the Lahore area.
Hercules plan to give expatriates an allowancecf 40 percent
of sa-Laries to cover the cost of housing and amenities in the
Lahore area.
The sum of one million dollars has been allocated to the
capital cost of "housing" to cover the cost of a guest house,
dispensary and such other amenities as are finally determined to
be required.
III.   CAPITAL COSTS
The total fixed cost of the project is estimated at $75.6 million.

Included in the above estimates are provisions for import duties and
other clearing charges of $9.2 million, spare parts of $3.6 million, and
provisions for escalation and contingency of $8.4 million. Import duties
and other clearing charges are calculated at the rate of 40% of the C&F
value of imported equipment and machinery, and 60% of the C&F value of
other items. Provisions for spare parts are based upon Hercules' stand-
ards for stocking at their own plants and include a two-year supply of
imported parts.  Provisions for escalation and contingencies are allowed
at a rateo1' o15% of the total fixed assets exclusive of pre-operating
exnenses and interest during construction.

after some experience in operating the facilities. High biuret (above 1%)
is reported to have a toxic effect on some plants. However, since recent
Pakistan tenders for imported urea stipulate a biuret content of a maxi-
mum of 0.3%, the sponsors are considering whether they should add a
crystallization step to meet this requirement. This may increase capital.
costs by up to half a million dollars.

There is a difference of opinion in the industry about the need for
coating. In the past, most U.S. companies have produced a coated product.
In the U.K. an uncoated product has been produced and handled successfully
by ICI. Uncoated product is planned for the ICI project at Kanpur in
India in which IFC has made an investment. There seems to be a preponder-
ance of opinion that the modern Toyo product need not be coated.
There is much discussion going on in the industry as to the dependable
on-stream time of large ammonia and urea plants. Most of these plants are
so new that information--to the limited extent to which it is available--is
probably not yet reliable. Experts with experience in this field believe
that the ammonia plant should achieve 340 stream days a year.   They also
believe that a large urea plant should operate 330 days a year were it not
dependent upon the ammonia plant for its ammonia and C02.   IFC has made
some independent checks on this question and it would appear that 310 days/
year for the urea plant is probably a conservative figure to use for. sav.
the first two years, but after that it should be possible to achieve 330
days. As was mentioned earlier. the canacitv of the urea nlant is based
on 310 days.
Hercules expect urea production to reach full capacity utilization in
two yearsq -I -i  suc qh  ni 1 inld isn possible, on t-he basns of our market
expectation it may take another two years to reach capacity operation if

with such a large plant operating in Pakistan there are bound to be teeth-
, ing 4 t ronb1-1 D 1 n  rS in lth4 f,irst years of oper.ations.
V.   PRODUCTION COST
Production costs have been conservatively estimated and were evaluated
by IFC in diScUSSiOnS witu the sponsors.   The largest cosLt iem is depreci-
ation, taken at 10% on plant and equipment, and 5% on civil works and
housing. The cost of the next largest item, natural gas, has been estimated
using rates about 4% higher than those included in a provisional gas
contract already signed and discussed under Gas Supply beloW.   Bags at $:i0
per ton of urea constitute the next important cost item. Operating and
maintenance materials and supplies are based on the current operations of
Hercules, facilities modified by knowledge of costs in WTest Pakistan.
Allowances have been made for normally expected increases in wage rates
and prices, and an appropriate provision for contingencies is included.
VI.   GAS SUPPLY
The plant will consume on the average of about 33 million and a peak
of 35 million cu.ft. of gas per day, or some 10,700 million cu.ft. per
year when producing at full capacity. Gas costs have been calculated on
the basis of a fixed annual charge of $1.05 million plus $0.279 per

on in a pro-ri-   ± conturactE, WILLUfl -U  %trLUa.L b±giitedU WLh SNte
Gas Pipeline (SNGPL). This higher price most likely will have to be paid.
Gas will be obtained from the Sui field some 350 miles southwest of
the plant site.  Althougn there is now a 16- gas pipeline from Sui to
Lyallpur and a 10? line onward to Lahore, these will not carry the addi-
tional load imposed by two new fertilizer plants. The gas transmission
company, SNGPL, plans to install 128 miles of partial loop lines of 181"
diameter between Sui and Lyallpur and 16"' diameter onward some 40 miles
towards the two new fertilizer plants. The estimated capital cost of
additional faciMlities is about $27 million and SNGPL has applied for a
Bank loan of $12 million.  A Bank mission has visited Pakistan to appraise
the gasline project, and the appraisal report recommends the financing.
With the expected gas offtake from the Sui field to meet both the
requirements of the north and the south of, together, 112 billion cu.ft.
per year (including the two urea plants in the Lahore area) present
reserves would last for 50 years. Since the proved reserves have increased
from 3.8 to about 6 trillion cu.ft. over the past decade and are expected
to continue to increase as the field is exploited, gas reserves are more
than adequate to also support the two urea plants.
While the provisional gas contract signed by SNGPL and Dawood (on
behalf of D-H Chemicals) guarantees a maximum sulfur content of 20 grains
per 100 cubic feet, actual sulfur content has not exceeded 3 grains per
100 cubic feet.  The ammonia plant, therefore, will be designed to handle
gas containing up to 5 grains per 100 cubic feet.
There is some chance that the sulfur content might increase as larger
volumes of gas are Dassed through the transmission system to sunplv the
fertilizer projects, although part of the expected increase in the assumed
gas  rince mentioned abovpe is to allowr for the installption of add-itiona1
sulfur removal equipment at the gas field.
If the sulfur content should increase beyond 5 grains per 100 cubic
feet. the designed seven dav regeneration cvcle in the ammronnia plant would
have to be reduced. Finally, a point could be reached where additional
equipment a+ t+.h ammonia plant would be less costly +.hnn sho-rter term

Since Fluor has a license from Toyo Koatsu, and since a large number
of successful Toyo plants have recently been built, Fluor under its con-
tract with Toyo will design and build the urea process unit. In addition,
the company will enter into a fixed price contract with Toyo Koatsu on
additional services in connection with the design and construction of the
urea plant.  Toyo will guarantee the performance of the plant.   Also,
since Kellogg has built more large ammonia plants than any other firm,
the company intends to award the ammonia facilities' design and engineer-
ing to Kellogg. Finally, Hercules will give on a "no profit" "no loss"
basis supervisory assistance to the company during construction. These
arrangements are satisfactory.
To the extent practicable equipment for the plant will be subjected
to international competitive bidding. All identifiable imported goods.
of together $23.2 million, will undergo international competition except
about $5.5 million. Of these about $2.0 million worth of aoods--for
reasons of reliability and standardization of design--will undergo
restricted bidding and for another $2.5 million of eoods the comnanv
plans to approach only one supplier. In these two categories equipment
would be expected to rome from the TJ.S., Ttavlv Jnpnn and Germany. The
remaining $1.0 million represents spare parts which are related to items
not subjected to full bidding.

Only preliminary engineering has been done and only tentative

reasonable progress in financial negotiations during June, Hercules is
prepared to finalize arrangements with the three major contractors and
to set engineering in motion in July. In this case detailed engineering
would be well under way by August.
A team of Hercules and Fluor personnel would go to Pakistan in late
June to finalize arrangements for soil bearing tests and other site
improvements. Legal access to the site has just been made available.
The team would also pre-qualify Pakistan contractors and material supplie!rs
and make other necessary arrangements for beginning construction.

Full managerial responsibility for day-to-day operations of the new
company will be vested in a General Manager who will be a director of
D-H Chemicals nominated by Hercules and to be appointed by the Board of
Directors. A Hercules expatriate is expected to be chosen for this
position.  While Dawood Industries Limited, a nucleus company of Dawqood,
will be appointed Managing Agent, it will function under the supervision
of the General Manager and will provideD-H Chemicals with administrative
services.  Commercial sales will be handled byD-H Chemicals and the seed*
ing program, already started by Dawood Corporation, will be transferred
toD-H Chemicals at a date to be agreed by the sponsors.
The sponsors have completed drafts of their agreements relating to
management and operation ofD-H Chemicals, which describe in detail the
technical services to be rendered by Hercules as foreign partner and
Dawood's role in management. The basic principles incorporated in these
drafts appear satisfactory.
Total staff and labor reauirements of the plant at full production
are estimated at about 600, including 29 Hercules expatriates. The
expatriates are exnected to be aradually reDlaced by Pakistani staff over
a four-year period after start-up. If necessary, the expatriate General
Manager and one or two key technical executives may be emnloved after
this four year period.  There is available a large pool of skilled and
unskillpd lanbor in TLhore and tSheikhiminirq  T,nhnore. the second largest
city in 1rest Pakistan has a population of more than two million.  An
adequate labor force can be recnuited wi+.hot+. any majior problems.

nitrogen in fertilizers will reach the projected 470O,000 metric tons by
1974/75, consumption actually may fall short of this figure. But even
if this were *the case, the more or less simultaneous completion during
1971 or early 1972 of one more 1,000 ton per day urea plant, in addition
to the Dawood/Hercules plant, should not cause more than temporary under-
utilization of plant capacity.

1.        Introduction
Agriculture is the most important industry in lWest Pakistan
and provides the livelihood of about 35 million people, or roughly 705'a
of the total population. Agriculture contributed about 42% to the Gross
Provincial Product in 1965, and the agricultural products and derivatives
accounted for nearly three-fourths of all exports from West Pakistan
in that year.
The total land area of West Pakistan is 199 million acres, of
which some 39 million acres or about 2NO are being cultivated; in addi-
tion there are a further 30 million acres which are potentially arable.
The most important agricultural areas lie in the plains which are traversed
by the Indus River and its tributaries; these plains run from the Himal-
avas in the north to the Arabian Sea in the south, and are bordered by
the hills of Baluchistan on the west, and by deserts on the southeast.
01 the total cultivated acreage 25% is estimated to lie within
100 miles of Lahore, and 50% within 200 miles. as shorn in thn map, Annex
1.   The agriculture in West Pakistan is sustained by one of the world's

ThAe need to increiase agricultural output is pressing.  rne
daily per capita calorie intake of the West Pakistan population in 1964/65
is believed to have been in the neighborhood of 2,000 calories and this
was only achieved with imports of 1,100,000 tons of wheat equivalent to about
one-4uarfer of the domestic production.  FAO considers 2,300 calories to
be the minimum average daily per capita requirement. In addition, the
growing population, wnich is expected to increase by 29.4% from the 1965
level of 51 million to 66 million in 1975, will require greater food pro-
duction even to maintain present calorie intake levels. Finally, the
country could conserve scarce foreign exchange, and reduce its dependence
on U.S. PL-480 grain shipments, if imports of staple foods were no longer
required. The Government is making a major effort to achieve self-
sufficiency in food grains by 1970.
To achieve an increase in per capita calorie intake of grow-
ing population to FAO standards by 1975, an increase in total calorie
intake of 49% will be required (1.15 x 1.294 equals 1.49). If we assume
no further imports of food grains, and an increase of cropped acreage from
39 to 46 million acres, it may be calculated that the overall increase in
yield per cropped acre required will be 26%.
To attain its goal of food self-sufficiency by 1970 (the last
year of the current Five-Year Plan), the Wiest Pakistan Government has
worked out a comprehensive program and approved an Implementation Planl/
in which it promotes the use of fertilizer and better seed varieties, aims

irrigated land and sets out guidelines in other related fields such as
transportation and agricultural credit. 'wiu some exceptions, discussed
further below in the report, the targets are about being met.   Of particular
importance is the large-scaie introduction of Mexican wheat varieties which
have already shown spectacular improvements in yields and are expected to
triple the present per acre wheat production. Indigenous varieties of wheat
do not respond well to increased use of fertilizer, but substantially in-
creased application of fertilizer will be needed on these new varieties.
2.   Past Consumption of Fertilizers
Estimates of past fertilizer consumption are conflicting since
distribution has been handled by different agencies, and apparent consump-
tion and aggregate sales do not agree.
Various estimates were compared and what is believed to be a good
approximation is given below:

the use of 175,000 tons for the year, thus tending to confirm advance est=
mates. Other sources (Dawood/Hercules) believe that total nutrient
consumption wi-l not surpass about 150,000 tons.

However, this should not detract from the fact that fertilizer usage in West
Paistan has increased by a-out 30% du.rig the period 1955,/56 to 1966/67 also
maintaining this rate in the past four years (1962/y63-1966/67). An even greate-

Finally it is evident that one of the most difficult hurdles to increased
fertilizer usage in developing countrLes has beer, uverUuIfe, in that, onU the
whole, farmers have already become aware of the benefits that fertilizer
can bring to them.
Of concern however is the low application rate of phosphatic fer-
tilizer (P205), A continuation of such unbalanced application of the dif-
ferent plant nutrients over more than a few years will adversely affect
agricultural yields and must thuis retard a further increase in the fertilizer
consumption. The Pakistan Governvment has agreed to make more phosphate avail-
able by importation and later by manufacture.
At present fertilizer is produced in West Pakistan in three plants
(see also the table on page 15) with total annual capacities of some 64,500
tons of N and about 3,000 tons of Pp0<. These plants were built during the!
period 1957/61 and are in course of being expanded. While full capacity has
been achieved at times operational and distribution problems are holding
production at about 80% of installed capacity, the balance of the country' s
needs are being imported.
3. Demand Forecast
A good many studies have been made (primarily in late 1965 and 1966)
in an attempt to forecast fertilizer demand in Wlest Pakistan through the
Fourth Plan peri-od (ending June 30. 1975) and beyond. As the Table below
shows, these forecasts - made for nitrogen only - diverge already for the
year 1969Q/70 (the lat+. veir of thA Third Plan) and substantially more so
for 1974/75. A Chart, Annex 2, shows this graphically.

year (final figures for 1965/66 were not then available) and because some
studies may not have been prepared as carefully as others which incorporate
a great deal of detailed analysis and back-up data (such as those of IACAII
and IBRD), the fact remains that an accurate assessment of future fertilizer
needs. particularly in the early years of widespread usage. is difficult to
make.' While individual inputs in agriculture for bringing about desired ol1t-
puts can be calculated - such as water. seeds. fertilizer, insecticides, anid
requirements for their distribution - the needs for mechanization and other
inprovement,s in fairming, for agrIGcutural credit and for farmers education
are much more difficult to forecast. They are so closely interrelated that,
while none of thTmin isolation wouild ma.ke mucth of an imnnpact hv i tself, fallurt-
of one of these factors would have serious consequences on the others.  Further-
more  anavrt from elimatic infIuenceq. in the end the nroner annlication of
many of these inputs - including fertilizer - depends on the skill and judpe-
rnpnt of the indivirdl fnamer atnd hiS realizationn of the potential advAnt'ag es

after a thorough field study.
It now appears that their estimates were too conservative.   Actual
fertilizer rutrogen growth ra.tes 'i the past few years since the study was
made have remained at about 28-30% per annum, while the study expected a ritro-
gen growth rate of only about 10i7. while TACA1s estimated sales for 1967/68
may be only slightly below actual sales during this year, their assumptior
for the s'tarting year 96'4/65 was considerably higher than actual sales
finally reported for that year. There is no indication that with all the
measures that the west Pakistan Government is taking to increase agricultuiral
production, demand for fertilizer nitrogen in the next seven years should not
increase more than the 10% per year that would be required to meet IACA's
demand expectation for 1974/75. The major reasons for this conservative esti-
mate appear to be that IAGA had judged that farmer acceptance of fertilizer
would be slower and difficulties in distribution would be greater than they
have so far turned out.
The IBRD report on the Water and Power Resources of lWest Pakistan
(setting out a program for the Development of Irrigation and Agriculture)
which evaluated IACA's study and which was issued in July 1967, also came to
the conclusion that IACA's demand expectations for fertilizer were too con-
servative, and revised them upward.
IBRD projected that nitrogen fertilizer consumption would increase
by about 23% per year to reach 250,000 tons (in terms of N) in 1969/70.
Thereafter during the Fourth Plan period (1969/70 - 1974/75) it expected the
growth rate to decline to about 13%. IBRD also pro-ected that fertilizer
usage would have become fairly widespread by this time and that further ex-
pansion in demand was, therefore. to come largely from farmers who were alreacd;
using fertilizer (but were beginning to use larger quantities per acre than
in the past) and from higher cropping intensities.   IBRD's estimates were
based on the following major assumptions:
(a)  The cultivable irrigated acreage in West Pakistan would be
nbout 31 million acre-s in 197)i/75, up from 27 yn,llron acres
in 1965.
(b)  The average intensity of cultivation would be about 107%
(up from            mean-7 that 0r a a-,ann  geab  7% of /0   avail=
able irrigated acreage would be cropped twice a year.
(c) The total cropped irrigated acreage would thus be about
3J3 mi-LLJ5on, aLr-s irL .L77L4I/75.
(ud  New var-Le"es of wheat and rice would oe introduced at a reLpid
rate, with about 45% of wheat acreage covered by 1975 (and
close to 907 by 1985).

prices-
(f) Foreign exchange would be available to purcnase all the im-
ported fertilizer that can be consumed and of the appropriate
types as long as West Pakistan is not self-sufficient in food
or fertilizer.
(g) Farmers would be applying in 1974/75 an average of 31 lbs. of
nitrogen per acre on 33 million irrigated, cropped acres, as
compared to about 6 lbs. in 1965.   In addition, it was expected
that the non-irrigated areas of about 13 million acres on which
in 1965 virtually no fertilizer was applied, would receive a
modest application of about 4 lbs. of nitrogen per acre.
Annex 3 gives in greater detail and for different crops the under-
lying assumptions on cropped acreage, specific nitrogen application (lb/acre),
both in absolute terms and as percent of the desired application, as well
as West Pakistants expected total nitrogen consumption for 1970, 1975 and
1985, with actual consumption in 1965.
The adoption of Mexican wheat was considered to be the major single
factor in the increased use of fertilizers, and was exrected to account for
about 32% and 4370 respectively of all nitrogen demand in West Pakistan in
1970 and 1975. Any delay in the intended shift from the indigenous to the
Mexican wheat variety or any fertilizer application rate different from the
one assumed will, therefore. substantially affect projacted nitrogen con-
sumpntion. The figures also indicate that in the irrigated areas on the
average onlv about lql of thA dpqirable auantitv of nitrogen wouild be annlied
by 1970, and only some 25% by 1975. There is, therefore, ample room for
f'irther incrPneas   in fmrtA1iz.r usage provided tha-+ the ote other necessnry agtri-
cultural inputs such as water, seed, pesticides, etc., would also be available

detailed implementation directives which have set nitrogen fertilizer con-
sumption in 1969/70 at 353,000 tons or some 406% above IBluRs expectations.
The Governmentis food self-sufficiency plan is based on the fol-
lowing major targets for 1969/70:

3. Increase irrigated wheat acreage by 1.5 million acres.
4. Make organizational changes, increase credit availability and
devise a system of incentives and subsidies to ensure that
input targets are in fact met.
5. Allocate funds in the Agricultural Development Program (ADP)
for water and agricultural projects on a priority basis, es-
pecially encouraging those which are linked to wheat self-
sufficiency.
The above targets are virtually the same as those assumed by IBED
in its study except that they provide for a faster build-up in fertilizer
usage. In order to attain these goals the Government - as set out in the
implementation directives mentioned further above - is prepared to import
the expected fertilizer deficiencies of some 780,000 tons of nutrients, of
which 160,000 tons is in terms of P20during the last three years of the
current Plan (1967/68 - 1969/70). The targets also provide for an increase
in irrization water by about 17 MAF (million acre feet), close to 95c' of
which is expected to come from additional (some 51,000) tubewells; for the
necessary seeding materials: for insecticides/pesticides (some 10,600 tons
during the remaining three years of the Plan); and for an increase during
the Plan period in instituAtiona1 credits to agriclulture hy some Rs 136 crcres
($290 million), wdhich the Government estimates should be sufficient to main-
tain the nresent relation of 10:90 between institutional and non-institutional
credit.  The directives also evaluate the availability of power transmission

construction (and facilities) and fertilizer usage. Unless total fertilizer
consumption (in terms or nutrients) in 1967/68 actually reaches more than
the 150,000 -- 170,000 ton estimate shown in the Table on page 3 (which may



mean between 125,000 and 150,000 tons of N), it is highly unlikely that the
Government's expectations of 353,000 tons of N for 1969/70 will be met, al.-
though the 250,000 tons forecast in the IBRD report may be attained.  It is
estimated that at present already some 2 million acres are under the im-
proved Mexipak wheat cultivation and that such acreage will increase to no,t
more than 4 million by 1969/70. Therefore, there does not appear to be a
reason for the recent historic growth rate of about 30% per year in nitrogen
consumption to increase to nearly 50% as it would have to do to meet the
Government's expectations.  Furthermore, while there appears to be adequate
provision to have sufficient additional water available (mainly through new
tubewells) to match the Government's target of fertilizer usaee by 1969/7(),
and while private tubewell installations are in fact proceeding as planned,
t.he mnaor nortion of the tubewell.q to be nrovided bv WAPDA and the. Trrilaation
Department (and they are responsible for about half of the additional water
to he. nrnvided by tube.wells) will only come in tnwards the end off the Plan
period. A more realistic estimate of nitrogen consumption in 1969/70 would
therefore appear to be i n the order of between 220,000 tons and 290,000 tons.
Any forecast beyond 1969/70 becomes increasingly more difficult, because

5. Water Supply
The shortage of irrigation water in the Indus Basin and more par-
ticularly the unreliability of supply has probably contributed more than
any other factor to the reluctance of the farmers in that area to use more
fertilizer.  At the prevailing low level of farm yields, farmers have found
it often more profitable to apply their supplies of water to a larger area
than can be properly watered. A general estimate is that crops receive on
average about 80% of the desirable application of water.
This underwatering has inhibited the introduction of improved i.n-
puts such as fertilizers and Mexipak wheat since the benefits of these are
seriously reduced or even neutralized in the absence of adequate water
supplies. In particular, Mexipak wheat needs not only three to four times
as much fertilizer as ordinary wheat, but also much larger quantities of
water. Nitrogenous fertilizers are applied to irrigated wheat mainly at
the first and second waterings. Inadequate and uncertain water supply
greatly increases the risks, and makes additional investment in fertilizers
more hazardous.



- 10 -
Fortunately, the mean combined flow of waters of the three of
the six indus Basin rivers (Indus, Jhelum and Chenab rivers), full use of
which is to be enjoyed by Pakistan has been estimated at 1h2 million acre
feet (MAF) per year after full implementation of the Indus Irter Treaty.
Present average canal diversions total 70 MAF per year, leaving consider-
able potential for future water conservation and use.
Fresh groundwater, containing less than 1,000 parts per million
of total dissolved solids, and thus suitable for irrigation without mixing
with fresh surface water, is estimated to lie under 1L.2 million acres.
The current usable recharge to the acquifer, which can be recovered for use
by tubewells, is about 30 MAF per year, but this would increase to 44 MAF
in the future as more water is distributed by the canal system. Both
Government and private farmers are pressing ahead with the installation of
tubewells, and more than 5,000 of these are being installed each year.
With the increases in water supplies now becoming available,
much larger quantities of fertilizer can be used and water should soon
cease to be a restraining factor to increased fertilizer usage.
6.   Distribution Oraanization
Culrrpntlv more than 6u^% of West Pakistan' s fertili zer reqpni rements
are imported, and the balance is produced in three Government factories. All
imports are handled on behalf of the Inirprnment by the Agri cultur2l Develop-
ment Corporation (ADC). There are no import duties on fertilizers, and thie
Goverrnment sells fert li zers to the farm.ers at pr.ies aol-Ni4- eiqul to +te
c. and f. cost of imports.  Government thereby subsidizes selling prices
to +he- ex+uent of the-             -+trb+ir  cosvs, wh4^c r-ge fr. about 22CE of
c. and f. prices for the more expensive urea to about 29% for cheaper

fertilizers produced in existing Government plants where production costs
are generally above c. and f. prices of equ valent im'ports.
The distribution organizatio     n so far has not been too satis-
factory and has undergone several changes.  Before the first fertilizer
plan carie into production in 1      e7r/ ft_ ilizers had been imported an  sold
privately. Then ADC was given responsibility for all fertilizer
distribution.  Towards the end of 1963 both thne MUltan and Daud nhel
fertilizer plants were overflowing with fertilizers which could not be
sold, and construction of new fertilizer storage was put in hand. In
December 1963 PIDC obtained permission from the Government to sell
domestically produced fertilizers directly to the farmers.   Within a
few months, PIDC had appointed some 1,000 selling agents all over West
Pakistan and within six months these agents had disposed of over 200,000
tons of fertilizer stocks. PIDC, as a matter of policy, selected as
agents the wealthier farmers who could afford to pay cash for fertiMlizers.
In appointing agents, particular attention was given to their reputation
and honesty, since adulteration of fertilizers with gypsum had been



discouraging farmers from the continued use of fertilizer. On ammonium
sulphate the agents were paid a commission of Rs 19 per ton out of a
selling price to the farmers of Rs 200 per ton, which was calculated to
give the agents a net profit of about Rs 10, or 5%.
By mid-1965, fertilizer consumption had outstripped supplies
(some of which were immobilized due to lack of transport), and since
imports were restricted due to the Indo-Pakistani hostilities some black
marketing becanq,apparent. Thereupon the Government returned all selling
to ADC and RSCCYwhich up to November 1967, have distributed all fertilizer,
both domestic and imported, with ADC selling about 25% and RSCC about 75%.
In August 1967, Government appointed three private parties as
principal selling agents, PEso, Dawood, and Pakistan National Oils (PNO)
Limited (a major distributor of petroleum products), with the idea of
stimulating fertilizer sales. There have been some weaknesses in the ADC
and RSCC distribution organizations, and it is hoped that keen competition
between private selling agents, each of whom intends to cover the whole
of West Pakistan, will foster sales.   PNO sold their first consienment of
imported fertilizers in November 1967.   Dawoods have already appointed
more than 150 sales agents and have sold their first shipment in Febhruary.
We anticipate that the entry of these three private parties (to be followed
shortly by Adamiees) will improve the overall distribution organizationsj
and lead to a sustained increase in sales.
7.   Transport
Transport has been a serious problem in the distribution system,
-ad will remain one - the fure.     Pakista    orts at Karach. large
quantities of food grains, more than 80% of which have to be transported
r.orth14 by ra4I 1 _as well1 _as othe LIA_ - "I-,orts.  A'lso, a -large proport Jon of
imports into Afghanistan are carried by this same railway.
Assuming that the two Lahore based urea plants will work at 90%
ofL capacty by L1 I      II4/  YW, I Le-yL-LW LUgeI   proUuce aboIub 27,U0UUU tons 01
nitrogen which would otherwise have to be imported. This quantity of
nItrogen would be equivailent to about 600,000 tOns of urea, or aboutv 1.3
million tons of ammonium sulphate.   Less than half of the local production
will be shipped by rail, arid then only about 150 miles on average, whereas
practically all fertilizers making the 813 mile trip from Karachi to Lahore
are carried by rail. Producing locally instead of importing will therefore
avoid the load on the railways. In addition, load will be reduced by lower
grain imports.
On the other hand, the sheer weight of fertilizers to be dis-
tributed in West Pakistan and the expected sharp increase in movement of
food from surplus areas to consumption centers will put a severe strain
on both rail and road transport. W*hile the Government railway authorities
and local trucking entrepreneurs are optimistic about their ability to
handle the large tonnage of fertilizer together will all the other
products requiring transport, there are bound to be transport difficulties
IJ Rural Supply Credit Co-operative Corporation.



in various parts of the marketing area, particularly between mandi towns
and the farmers.  The question of transport wiLl require continued review.
8.   Storage
Wholesale fertilizer sales in the decade up to 1964 have averaged
two peaks, the first in September (with sales 24% of annual sales) and the
second in June (with sales 10% of annual sales). With the recent intro-
duction of Mexipak wheat which is sown in November and December, the
seasonal pattern has changed. In the past two years there have been large
peaks in August/September and November/December, and a smaller peak in May.
During the peak months of fertilizer usage it is impossible to
move the required tonnage from a central stock pile (as at the manufacturing
plant) to the farms as rapidly as it is needed.   Hence all fertilizer manu-
facturers and distributors have found it necessary to establish numerous
stock piles as close as possible to the point of use. In West Pakistan
these storage facilities have been inadequate and consequently serious
shortages have occurred at peak selling seasons while stocks built up at
the manufacturing plants. The Government agencies have tried to alleviate
the storage problem by renting godowns in market towns, but rented space
has often been of poor quality and in units of too small a size. The Third
Plan had poroposed construction of 2,500 godowns with caDacities of 50 to
175 tons, giving new storage space totalling more than 250,000 tons.   How-
ever, we could not ascertain how much storage has been constructed.
The forecasts of monthly shinments and sales and resulting re-
quirements for storage, both in the plants and in the field need to be
reviewed by the fertilizer companie.    Tt mr.a hb fonin(- thnt at least fonr

Program.  The Third Five-Year Plan recognizes the need for increased credit
but does not attempt to do more than maintain the presen-t ratio of insti-
tutional to non-institutional credit of about 10:90.
With the particular aim of making more credit available to
facilitate the sale of fertilizer through private sector channels in wesi
Pakistan, the Pakistani Government and US AID are working on an agreemen.t
which would set up a fertilizer and pesticide refinance and credit guaran-
tee fund. Within its intended functions the fund would: (i) issue guarantecs



to wholesalers and retailers to cover a portion (possibly up to 65%) of
of the credit provided to wholesalers by commercial banks.
The two fertilizer companies fully recognize the importance of
adequate credit and wi'l follow the establishment oI this fund closely.
Also, one of the local sponsors who is already in the banking business
plans to estzablish a number of new rural offices for handling farmer
credits.
10. Low Farmer Purchasing Power, Crop and Fertilizer Prices
An important limitation on fertilizer sales is farmer income.
In West Pakistan agricultural yields have been much below those of more
developed countries resulting in low gross income per acre. The use of
better seed varieties and more fertilizer will help yields and so provide
more income per acre.
The introduction of Mexipak wheat has already shown spectacular
results. Yields of 3,000 lb. to 4,000 lb. per acre (and a record of
6,600 lb.) have been reported as compared to the average of about 750 lb.
for indigenous wheat. Similar increases in rice yields are being obtained
by the introduction of Irri-rice from the Philippines.
Farmer income and hence fertilizer consumption is also dependent
upon the relation between the prices he receives for his crops and the
prices he has to pay for fertilizer and other farm inputs. In April 1966
the Pakistani Government increased prices for food grains by 10% to 26%
in order to give farmers more incentives to increased nroduction. The
minimum wheat price has been increased to Rs 17 per maund or $98 per ton.
Average incremental vyilds in Mexinak wheat so far from anplirations of
nitrogen have been about 7 lb. of wheat per lb. of nitrogen applied. In
other words a fanrmer applning 2=3 tons Of urea, contninirng one ton of
nitrogen and costing $242, to 50 irrigated acres can expect an increase

11. The Availability of Nutriants Other Than Nitrogen
Applications of plant nutrients other than nitrogen especially
phosphate (P205) have so far been insufficient. Existing phosphatic fer-
tilizer capacity and capacity under construction in 1Aest Pakistan is only
some 8,500 tons per year in terms of P205 as compared to 175,000 tons of
N. Total targeted application during the last three years of the present
Five-Year Plan period is also only 170,000 tons of P205 versus 890,000 tcns
of N representing a ratio of N:P20 of 1:0.2. Furthermore actual applica-
tion of P20c has fallen considerably short of the yearly target so far.
The target is well below a generally accepted minimum ratio of 2:1 (W:P2CIq)
which, as the agricultural program matures, normally would be expected tc
come closer to 1:1.
While in the first years of fertilizer application a high crop
yield will be obtained with application of nitrogen nutrient alone, a yield
will soon drop unless Pp0< is also aDplied in adequate volume.  A lack of
phosphatic fertilizer would have a definite retarding effect on the use of
nitrogen fertilizer and in fact the recent economic IBRD mission to Pakistan
has singled out the lack of application of phosphatic fertilizers as the
most serious potential restraint to increased fertilizer usaFe in Pakistan
and the attainment of the goal of food self-sufficiency by the end of this
decade.  IBRD/IFC have therefore asked the Paki stan rnvernment--whi rh has.
agreed--to make possible the importation of sufficient phosphatic fertil-
iz7.ers to complePment the nitrogen fertilizer which is to be used in WA.est
Pakistan.
Potash consumption is so low (not over 100 tons per year) that
i+ 4is -  red-A lnr4.os+ repor+s,  the Thi rd Fiv-+Ye,- DPar1 has no target-
for potash usage. The level of K20 in W4est Pakistan soils is apparently

12. Expected Demand for Nitrogen Fertilizer in 1974/75
W4ith all evidence now avail.able we believe that it should be
possible for West Pakistan to obtain a consumption of nitrogen for fertil-
izer of some 470,000 tons by 1974/75. The attainment of such a level of
consumption would be a major achievement and would require a continuation
of the Government's concerted efforts to increase agricultural output
during the Fourth Plan and give priority to all areas supporting this aimi.
In particular it would mean for the Government to permit fertilizer imports
of an adequate volume and type to match the other agricultural inputs in
order to prepare the market for the substantial additional nitrogen fer-
tilizer capacity now being planned.



ITbile it is not inconceivable that nitrogen fertilizer consump-
tion in 1974/75 could even be at or above 500,000 tons, it could reach
also, say, only 400,000 tons.  However, as will be discussed further below
additional fertilizer capacity in West Pakistan can be economically planned
and phased to cover such possible range.
13. Facilities to Meet Demand
Below is a summary of the existing fertilizer plants and those
under construction and planned in West Pakistan. The dates shown for
availability of production are estimates taken from several sources. On
the assumption that the already available fertilizer capacity is fully
utilized: that new facilities will take approximately 3 years to be
implemented; that it will take a further 3 years till full capacity is
reached from these new facilities and that the fertilizer requirements
forecast by IBRD for 1974/75 are correct and are to be met by local
supplies; additional fertilizer capacitv eauivalent to about 300,000 tons
of nitrogen and about 227,000 tons of P205 need to be established.

The Government of Pakistan has authorized three new urea
proJects In addition to the Esso project now under construction.  Each
would have a nominal capacity of 1,000 tons per day of urea equivalent
to 10U,UUV tons OI' nitrogen per annum. Tney are tne Adamjee-uyana id
and Dawood-Hercules projects in the Lahore area, and the Hyesons-Kaiser
project at iviari, 350 miles soutnwest of Lahore.
Under consideration is also a T.S.P. plant to be erected in the
Karachi area with an annual capacity of 150,000 tons.  However, particul-
arly since it is not clear when this plant would go ahead the Government
has been asked by IBRD/IFC--as mentioned earlier--to permit the importat:Lon
of sufficient phosphatic fertilizers to complement the new nitrogen
capacity. Further urgent consideration should be given to the possibility
of producing mixed fertilizers with part of the proposed ammonia capacity.
Hercules and Hyesons have informally indicated a willingness to
consider the manufacture of phosphatic fertilizers at a future date after
the presently proposed facilities are in operation. Meanwhile, Dawood
Corporation, in its plans as Sales Agent, proposes to sell approximately
150,000 tons annually of ordinary superphosphate (or equivalent) in con-
junction with sales of urea, both during the pre-production seeding period
and after production begins.
14. Competition
The three proposed 1,000 metric ton per day urea plants, together
wi th the small Nultan expnnsion and the Rsso  Cnn metric ton per day plnnt
now under construction would increase urea production capacity in West
Pakistan by 1,700% frnom C.Q9,000 tons now to about 1.0 millio4n  tons per year,
and nitrogen production capacity by 1,000% from about 64,000 tons now to

has been planned with a daily capacity of 600 tons of ammonia. This
has agreed to postpone construction.  Presumably the Government would not
proceed unless, after the private projects have                 --A o e,t
market would justify such an expansion of capacity.
However, even without the Daud Khel plant, proceeding with all
three new urea plants mOre or less simultaneously would increase rntVrogen.
capacity beyond the foreseeable market potential at the time of completion
of these projects.  Assuming that construction oI the three plants was to
begin before the end of 1968 they would be completed by late 1971. The
following table shows plant utilization rate in 1974/75 (more than three
years after assumed completion) for two and three projects if they were
to proceed simultaneously and for a market in that year of respectively
400,000 and 470,000 tons of nitrogen.

less than 200 miles from both Shekhupura and Mari, where transport costs
would be about equil from both plWan  siUes.  A Mr'i plant wou'd enjoy a
$6 per ton cost advantage here. Esso certainly plans to sell urea in
this rrultan market area.
At the present time the price of imported urea, c.i.f. X\aracfu.,
is about $105 per ton or about $117 c.i.f. Lahore. This compares with an
ex-plant selling price of about $93-95 per ton of urea that Adamjee and
Dawood expect to charge. In five to ten years with a significant number
of large low-cost ammonia/urea plants having come on stream it may be
possible to purchase urea c.i.f. Karachi at $63 per ton and therefore in.
Lahore for about $75 per ton. However, imports of urea will probably
not be a factor since the Government will not grant import licenses if
there is adequate capacity in Pakistan.

15. Conclusions
While fertilizer consumption in West Palistan is still relatively
low it has rather steadily increased over the past decade at a rate of
nearly 3C% per annum. While this growth rate has been lower than is hoped
for in the present Five-Year Plan it has nevertheless been impressivre. The
introduction of new varieties of wheat and rice seeds as part of the policy
of the Pakistan Government to obtain self-sufficiency in food grains by
1970 has no doubt helped stimulate the demand for fertilizer which on the
whole seems to be well accepted by the Pakistan farmer.
Provided that the Pakistan Government also in the Fourth Plan
will nursimip its ditnrminnd nolicy of innrPaniIng agrimiltnral outnut and
give high priority to all factors that will foster this goal it is real-
;.tct.  +.n nascsime +.hac+.onsnunmn+pinn nf nim roan fPrtili;e.r will grow from
about 125,000 to 150,000 tons in the current year (1967/68) to some
470,000 tons in 197h/7K or by an average annual rate of close to 20%.
This would allow two additional urwea plan.ts of together about
330,000 tons annual capacity in terms of N to be installed simultaneously
