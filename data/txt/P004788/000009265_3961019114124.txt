SECOND POWER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 3138-TH)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Power System
Development Project in Thailand for which Loan 3138-TH in the amount of US$94 million equivalent
was approved on December 12, 1989. The loan was closed on September 30, 1994, after a six-month
extension of the loan closing date. It was fully disbursed, and the last disbursement took place on
December 1, 1994.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Brahm Prasher, Consultant for the Infrastructure
Operations Division of Country Department 1, East Asia and the Pacific Region, and was reyiewed by
Mr. Vineet Nayyar, Chief of Infrastructure Operations, East Asia and Pacific Region I.
Preparation of the ICR was begun during the ICR Completion Mission in July, 1994.
The ICR is based on the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the Loan and Guarantee Agreements,
supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and EGAT, internal Bank memoranda and other
material in project files. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by providing most of
the financial, performance, and investment data for the  project and supplementing the Bank's
information on the project implementation and operational experience. The Borrower has not furnished
its final evaluation report on the project, however, it has sent a fax agreeing with the report and
providing comments, which have been incorporated in the report.

SECOND POWER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 3138-TH)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.           The Bank has had a close working relationship with EGAT since 1957, when the Bank
financed its first project with EGAT's predecessor, the Yanhee Electricity Authority.  Thailand
experienced high demand growth rates for electric energy in the late 1980's, and this growth rate was
expected to continue in the 1990s with growth in economic activity. The power development strategy
formulated by EGAT and the National Economic and Social Development Board, in consultation with
the Bank, anticipated annual outlays exceeding US$1 billion for several years in the 1990's. At the
same time, the Royal Thai Government (RTG) was also seriously concerned with the magnitude of
public sector debt that would accrue in pursuing the required investment program; hence, it decided to
marshall the resources of the private sector, while formulating an overall strategy for privatization of
state enterprises. At the RTG's request, the Bank provided assistance in reviewing the issues and
options concerning privatization in the power industry during project preparation in August 1989 (paras.
2.           The loan of US$94 million approved by the Bank for the Second Power System
Development Project was to assist in financing a two year (FY90-91) time-slice of EGAT's investment
program for the Sixth Five-Year Plan (FY87-91), which at appraisal was estimated to cost US$2.78
billion. The objectives of the loan were to: (a) meet growth in power demand expected over the
medium term at least cost; and (b) strengthen EGAT's capabilities in environmental monitoring and
evaluation through technical assistance and acquisition of monitoring equipment. The loan could be
used to finance any power system development project or related activity, which was approved by the
RTG and met the resettlement and environmental standards acceptable to the Bank (paras. 3-4).
3.            Following loan approval and at EGAT's request, the Bank allocated US$55 million for
completion of construction of the Bang Pakong Blocks 3 and 4 (2x300 MW) dual fired combined cycle
plant, and a transmission reinforcement component required to evacuate the additional power produced.
An amount of US$27 million was provided to complete construction of the expansion of the Mae Moh
mine to increase lignite production capability from 5.6 MMt/y to 9.5 MMt/y to fuel additional power
capacity at the complex which was expected to increase from 825 MW in FY87 to 1,425 MW in FY91.
The balance of the loan totalling US$12 million was allocated to finance the construction of a substation
in South Thonburi. With power demand increasing rapidly in the Bangkok area, reinforcement of the
existing 230 kV transmission capabilities and construction of the South Thonburi substation was found
to be more cost effective compared to the addition of generation capacity locally (paras. 5 and 10).
I/ Para. numbers refer to paras. in the main report.



-Ill-
Implementation Experience and Results
4.           The physical components for the three projects financed under this loan were fully
completed with substantial realization of the objectives for each. The completion of the Bang Pakong
combined cycle project resulted in critical capacity increase needed to supply more electric energy. The
increase in lignite production with simultaneous completion of power units 8 and 9 at Mae Moh also
facilitated in the addition of significant needed capacity (paras. 8-9).
5.           Completion of the Bang Pakong project was delayed by a year, largely due to adverse
weather conditions during construction, shortage of cement supply in Thailand and delays in delivery of
equipment. Excluding IDC, the overall combined cycle project was completed at a cost of US$390
million, about US$57 million above estimate. The major portion of the cost overrun was due to the
tight international supply situation for combined cycle plants. The cost overrun for the transmission
component totalled US$3.6 million out of a completion cost of US$15.6 million (paras. 15-16).
6.           Installation of the lignite handling system  and procurement of auxiliary mining
equipment was delayed by two months; this component of the Mae Moh lignite mine expansion project
was completed at US$52 million, about US$15 million above the estimated base cost. The social works
component for the mine project was completed at a cost of US$89 million, about US$20 million above
the estimated base cost. Overall, the mining project was completed at US$146 million, and this is
about US$19 million above the estimated cost, after allowing estimated contingencies of USi17 million.
The South Thonburi substation was completed at a cost of US$21 million (para. 17).
7.           A number of institutional strengthening initiatives were implemented under the Loan
Agreement to improve monitoring, organizational and manpower capabilities in the environmental area.
The Mae Moh mine and power complex and the Bang Pakong plant operated in 1993 and early 1994 in
compliance with emission and discharge standards acceptable to the Bank and the RTG. With further
expansion of the mine and power complex in Mae Moh in recent years, the potential exists for
exceeding pollution standards which may impact health and the environment adversely (para. 13).
EGAT has instituted both interim and long term measures to reduce impact and improve the
environment.  Resettlement and compensation of villagers displaced by the expansion have been
completed satisfactorily (paras. 13 and 27).
8.           EGAT's financial performance during FY89-93 has been satisfactory and was within the
covenanted parameters. The average rate of return (ROR) during the period was 9.1 %. The RORs in
FY92 and FY93 of 8.04% and 6.28%, respectively, were appreciably lower than the RORs for the first
three years during the period because remittances to the RTG increased significantly.  The self-
financing ratio averaged 40%, the average debt-service coverage ratio was 1.97 times while the debt to
total capital ratio averaged 45 % during the period. The average operating and current ratios during the
five year period were also satisfactory at 80% and 89%, respectively. The Mine Directorate which has
been highly profitable and operated as a separate profit center, is in compliance with Bank covenants on
debt to equity and debt service coverage ratios (para. 11).
9.           The re-estimated internal economic rate of return calculated using similar methodology
as employed in the SAR for EGAT's Power Development Plan (FY90-99), the Bang Pakong Block 3
and 4 combined cycle project, the lignite mine expansion project considered together with power units
8 and 9, and the lignite mine project considered on its own are 13.2%, 23.3%, 21.4% and 114%,



-iv-
respectively. The first three values are close to predictions. The unusually high rate of return for the
mine, when considered on its own, stems from the superior performance of mining operations and the
high transfer prices derived from net-back calculations for lignite (para. 12).
10.           EGAT's implementation effort on the projects was staffed with its own capable teams,
with assistance from consultants. The projects were well-designed and organized, and on the whole the
execution has been satisfactory. Objectives for the projects were realized substantially, and the outcome
has been also satisfactory. Overall, EGAT performed satisfactorily and coped well with contingencies
during the construction phase. The Bank also performed satisfactorily on the project and was helpful
in promoting measures for improvement of the environment (para. 15).
Future Operations, Findings and Lessons Learned.
11.           Benefits for the projects completed under this loan are likely to be sustained, since
EGAT is endowed with broad-based capabilities to service and operate its projects efficiently. EGAT's
financial position is strong, and it has a tariff structure in place to recapture costs, produce an adequate
ROR, and generate sufficient funds to finance part of its investment program. Adequate supply of
natural gas for the combined cycle plant is assured by the PTT, and the plant can operate on distillate
during supply emergencies. The benefits for the projects will be measured in the future by monitoring
performance and economic parameters, as agreed with the Bank during the completion mission. EGAT
will continue monitoring environmental conditions at the Mae Moh and Bang Pakong plant sites.
Measures in place to minimize inversion effects during unfavorable weather conditions and to ensure
production of acceptable quality lignite at Mae Moh will be continued, pending installation of flue gas
desulfurizers on power plant units 8-13 (para. 18).
12.           The findings and lessons learned are as follows: (a) certain shortcomings experienced
during implementation suggest that management and staff skills need to be continuously updated to
compensate for deficiencies in performance levels of contract workers; (b) the concept of time-slice
lending has been successful and provides the Borrower with flexibility in arranging financing for its
large investment program; (c) involvement of the private sector in mining operations has resulted in
cost-effective and efficient operations; and (d) the close relationship between the Bank and EGAT has
provided a channel for conducting wide-ranging discussions through which important initiatives have
resulted in strengthening the utility (paras. 28-30).

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
THAILAND
SECOND POWER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 3138-TH)
PART I. IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
1.           The Bank has had a close working relationship with key entities in the energy sector in
Thailand, especially in the power subsector. The Bank's involvement with the Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand (EGAT), a Government-owned company responsible for generating and
transporting most of the bulk power produced in the country, goes back to 1957 when the Bank financed
its first project with EGAT's predecessor, the Yanhee Electricity Authority. In recent years, EGAT and
the Royal Thai Government (RTG) have continued to welcome modest contributions from the Bank to
EGAT's large investment program, since the Bank's participation provides a good source of disinterested
counsel and expertise from which the utility can benefit as it evolves into a strong institution.
2.           Thailand experienced a sharp upsurge in economic growth in the early 1980s, and this
growth was accompanied by an upsurge in demand for electric energy, which in the FY87-89 period was
unexpectedly high (14% p.a.). The outlook was for continued rapid expansion in demand in the early
1990s. The escalated electricity demand made it necessary for EGAT to accelerate power capacity
additions to ensure reliable supplies of electricity. The power development strategy formulated by EGAT
and the National Economic and Social Development Board, in consultation with the Bank during project
preparation, envisaged outlays totalling over US$1 billion per annum over the following several years.
At the same time, the RTG was also seriously concerned with the magnitude of public sector debt that
would accrue in pursuing the required investment program; hence it decided to marshall the resources
of the private sector, while formulating an overall strategy for privatization of state enterprises. At the
RTG's request, the Bank provided assistance in reviewing the issues and options concerning privatization
in the power industry during project preparation in August 1989.
3.           The loan of US$94 million approved by the Bank for the Second Power System
Development Project was to assist in financing a two-year (FY90-91) time-slice of the investment
program during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period (FY87-91). Its main objectives were to:
a.    meet the growth in power demand expected over the medium term at least-cost; and
b.    strengthen EGAT's capabilities in environmental monitoring and evaluation through
technical assistance.
4.           The loan approved by the Bank could be used to finance the installation of additional
generation capacity, reinforcement and expansion of the transmission system, expansion of EGAT's
lignite mining capacity to fuel additional power generation capacity, and miscellaneous works and
equipment acquisition. Use of this loan proceeds to cover part or all of the cost of any project under
EGAT's investment program during FY90-91 was permissible, provided that the project: (a) was
technically sound and economically justified; (b) had been approved by the RTG; (c) had its



-2-
environmental and resettlement aspects addressed in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; and (d) followed
procurement arrangements consistent with the Loan Agreement.
5.           The loan approved was used to finance the following projects out of a list of several
projects for EGAT's FY90-91 investment program: (d) US$55 million was allocated for completion of
2X300 MW units of the Bank Pakong combined cycle plant; (b) US$27 million was allocated to finance
the completion of a lignite conveyor belt system for the Mae Moh mine expansion to fuel power Units
8 and 9; and (c) the balance of US$12 million was allocated for the construction of a substation at South
Thonburi.
6.           During preparation of the project, EGAT agreed to implement measures to strengthen its
capabilities in environmental monitoring and evaluation. These measures were to include the development
of environmental policies, procedures and objectives for operating its facilities, as well as the
development of adequate organizational and manpower capabilities to monitor and evaluate its programs.
Additionally, EGAT also agreed to undertake a study to evaluate EGAT's operational efficiency which
would: (a) assess the productivity of EGAT's departments; (b) identify general areas of the operations
which may be significantly improved; and (c) recommend specific measures for improvement, including
development of norms for monitoring of performance.
7.           Prior to this loan, EGAT had obtained two other Bank loans (Loan 2000-TH and Loan
3027-TH) which made use of a time-slice approach in partially financing EGAT's power development
program. The experience with this approach had been positive, and continuation of the approach under
this loan posed no undue risks with respect to the Borrower's ability to implement the projects
successfully.
B. Achievement of Obiectives
8.           The physical components of the three projects financed under this loan were completed
in their totality. Successful completion of the Bang Pakong Blocks 3 and 4 combined cycle plant (2X300
MW) added significant capacity to help meet the high demand growth rates being experienced in the
1990s in Thailand. The two combined cycle blocks represented about 8.5% of the existing capacity in
1989, when the project was started. Electric demand growth in Thailand between FY89-93 was about
68%, which is substantially higher than the appraisal estimate of 49%. The capacity addition at the Bang
Pakong plant was based on a design with dual firing and automatic fuel switching capabilities to permit
use of distillate during gas fuel interruptions. The existing Bang Pakong to Bang Phili line was
reinforced under this project to evacuate the additional output from the Bang Pakong plant using existing
right-of-way. The project was designed in a manner to minimize environmental impact with respect to
emission, discharge and noise pollution levels.
9.           With the planned addition of Power Units 8 and 9, the total lignite-based generating
capacity at the Mae Moh complex was expected to increase from 825 MW in FY87 to 1,425 MW in
FY91. EGAT planned a corresponding expansion in lignite production capabilities from 5.6 MMt/y in
FY88 to 9.1 MMt/y in FY91. Design and installation of the third lignite conveyor and handling system
and procurement of auxiliary mining equipment under this loan was completed according to project plans
prepared under the First Power System Development Project (Loan No. 3027-TH). Production of lignite
at the mine reached 11.3 MMt/y in FY91. For EGAT's lignite mining department, operational



-3-
achievements have been considerably enhanced with increased involvement of the private sector in mining
operations. This involvement, which commenced during implementation of the Second Mae Moh Lignite
Project (Loan No. 2407-TH), resulted in substantial reduction in EGAT's mining investment program,
since excavation contractors are required to own equipment for overburden removal and other operations
in which they participate.
10.          To supply additional power to the high growth Bangkok area, reinforcement of the
existing 230 kV transmission capabilities and construction of a substation at Thonburi was found to be
necessary under the FY90-91 investment program. The Bank allocated US$12 million from the loan for
construction of the South Thonburi substation. The decision to reinforce the transmission capabilities and
construct a substation was based on least cost analysis of competing options: (a) to add generation
facilities locally; or (b) to provide additional transmission capabilities to transport more power to the local
area. No resettlement and environmental issues were involved in the implementation of this project
component, since construction of the substation and reinforcement of the transmission facilities were
implemented on existing right-of-ways and available land.
11.          EGAT's financial performance during FY89-93 (Appendix B) has been satisfactory and
was within the covenanted parameters. The average rate of return (ROR) during the period was 9.1 %.
The RORs in FY92 and FY93 of 8.04% and 6.28%, respectively, were appreciably lower than the RORs
for the first three years during the period because remittances to the RTG increased significantly. The
self-financing ratio averaged 40%, the average debt-service coverage ratio was 1.97 times while the debt
to total capital ratio averaged 45% during the period. The average operating and current ratios during
the five year period were also satisfactory at 80% and 89%, respectively.
12.          With completion of the projects financed under this loan, the internal economic rate of
return (IERR) calculated for EGAT's PDP (FY90-99) is 13.2% (Part II, Table 9A), and is a little lower
than the estimate of 14.5%, mainly because of higher than expected investment costs, albeit for higher
than forecast energy sales. The re-estimated IERR for the Bang Pakong Blocks 3 and 4 combined cycle
plant of 23.3%  (Part II, Table 9B) is also slightly lower than the estimate of 25%. The IERR of the
Mae Moh lignite mine expansion has been estimated for two cases: first, by considering the combined
investment in lignite mine expansion and power generation for Units 8 and 9; and second, by considering
the investment in mining alone. In the first case, the recalculated IERR is 21.4% compared to the
estimate of 13% (Part II, Table 9C). The large difference may be explained by the higher actual plant
factors, higher lignite power generating efficiencies, and lower lignite mining costs than corresponding
assumptions. The IERR for the second case (the mine being considered on its own) is 114%. This
unusually high IERR can be largely explained by high lignite transfer prices derived from net back value
calculations of a hypothetical coal power plant based on the use of imported coal, as shown in Appendix
C. The landed price of imported coal includes international shipping costs and inland transportation of
the coal. The Lignite Mine Directorate, which operates as a separate profit center as required by Bank
covenants, is highly profitable and is in compliance with Bank covenants with respect to its debt to equity
and debt service coverage ratios. Its financial performance is discussed in some detail in Appendix B.
13.          The RTG and EGAT are committed to sound environmental policies and practices. The
Bang Pakong power plant has been operating within the ambient air and water quality standards accepted
by both the RTG and the Bank. However, with significant expansion of the Mae Moh power and mining
complex in recent years, the potential for exceeding discharge and emission standards accepted by the
Bank and the RTG has increased significantly, and the Bank is supporting programs aimed at
reinforcement of mitigation, preventive, and other special measures to improve environmental quality at



-4-
the complex, under the Third Power System Development Project (Loan 3423-TH). As agreed under this
loan, a number of institutional strengthening initiatives were implemented to improve monitoring,
organizational, and manpower capabilities. Several international consultants have been engaged to assist
in evolving measures and strategies to minimize the environmental and health impacts at the Mae Moh
complex. The specific environmental conditions at the two plant sites discussed here, the measures being
implemented to monitor and reduce impact, and initiatives being pursued to improve environmental
conditions are described at length in Appendix D. Resettlement and compensation of villagers displaced
by the expansion of the Mae Moh mine has been completed satisfactorily, and details on implementation
accomplishments are described in brief in Appendix D.
14.          The Power Efficiency Study initiated during the implementation of this project was
completed in October 1993. The study covers eight operations within the utility, viz. corporate planning,
system dispatch, organization, economic and financial systems, human resources and power system
planning, proposed recommendations and action plans to improve EGAT's operations, including a
reorganization of the corporate structure. At the time of the completion mission, the proposals were
being reviewed by EGAT's privatization committee. Additionally, the last phase of a privatization study
completed in the first half of 1994 is expected to lead to an action plan to convert EGAT into a share-
owned company whose shares will be traded on the stock-exchange in Thailand. Proposals are also being
considered for privatization of some operations to raise equity capital to finance the large power
generation investment program in future.
C. Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
15.          EGAT's implementation effort for the projects under this loan was staffed with its own
capable teams, with assistance from foreign and local consultants where needed. The projects were well
conceived, designed and organized.  Project preparation, approval, procurement and construction
activities for the Bang Pakong plant and the lignite mining handling system were commenced under
previous Bank financing. Tables 5 and 8A (Part II) depict actual implementation performance as
compared to original estimates for the two projects. The gas turbines for the two combined cycle blocks
at the Bang Pakong plant were installed on time and EGAT was able to benefit from their operation while
the generators were being completed. However, there were 11 and 12-month delays, respectively, in the
construction completion of the steam generators for the two combined cycle blocks. Major reasons for
delay in the completion of the project were adverse weather conditions at the site, delay in delivery of
equipment and materials, unavailability of suitable instruments in inventory, and deficiencies in the
capabilities of workers which also resulted in some damage to installed equipment through a derrick crane
accident. An acute shortage of cement in Thailand, resulting from a construction boom and Government
restrictions on cement, was a significant factor contributing to delay in site preparation and construction
for the plant.
16.          Excluding interest during construction (IDC), the overall Bang Pakong combined cycle
project was completed at a cost of US$390 million (Part II, Table 8A), about US$57 million above the
estimate. A tight international supply situation for gas turbines, which was unanticipated, resulted in a
cost overrun of US$56 million in completing the 2x300 MW power blocks. The associated 230 KV
transmission line extension needed to evacuate additional power completed at a cost of US$15.6 million,
was US$3.6 million above estimate. However, the cost of consultant services for project design and
supervision was US$1.6 million less than the estimate of US$11.6 million. Including IDC, the combined



-5-
cycle project with the associated transmission lines was completed at a cost of US$412 million compared
to the estimate of US$333 million.
17.          While procurement of most of the auxiliary equipment for the Mae Moh lignite mine
under this Loan was completed two months earlier than estimate, this component was completed with a
two month delay in June 1991 (Part II, Table 5).  The social works components, viz. water
supply/diversion and related civil works, were also delayed by about seven months to September 1992.
Including IDC, the completion cost for installation of the lignite handling system, procurement of
auxiliary mining equipment, water diversion, related civil works, resettlement for displaced villagers, and
technical support/training totalled US$146 million, about US$19 million above the appraisal estimate (Part
II, Table 8A). The South Thonburi substation which was appraised following approval of the loan was
completed in February 1993 at a cost of US$20.7 million, including IDC of US$1.3 million. The eight-
month delay in the completion of this project and the civil works component of the lignite mine project
can be attributed partially to shortages and tight supply of cement in Thailand during construction.
D. Project Sustainability
18.          Benefits from the project are likely to be sustained into the foreseeable future for the
following reasons:
a.    EGAT has in-place standard preventive and maintenance practices to ensure operability
and efficient functioning of its generation and transmission systems. Its workforce is
competent, experienced and adequately trained, and staff development is continuously
emphasized within EGAT. EGAT's mine operations are highly efficient, and the Mine
Department's achievements in the past have amply demonstrated its capability to sustain
its operations.
b.    EGAT's financial performance has been strong. A tariff structure is in place based on
recapturing costs, producing an adequate return on capital, and to generating sufficient
funds internally to finance 25 % or more of its power development program. Impending
privatization actions also are likely to contribute further to EGAT's financial strength.
c.    The Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) has confirmed the availability of adequate
natural gas to fuel the combined cycle plant over its lifetime. The plants financed under
this loan are provided with dual firing capabilities to enable use of distillates during gas
supply emergencies.
E. Bank Performance
19.          The Bank's performance in project identification, preparation assistance, appraisal and
supervision was satisfactory. The Bank has a good relationship with EGAT and the RTG which enables
it to play a constructive role in power development in Thailand. The Bank has been effective in
promoting actions to strengthen EGAT's environmental capabilities and in reducing environmental impact
in EGAT's development projects which the Bank finances.



-6-
20.           The Bank's long association with an experienced and capable Borrower made it possible
to conduct project preparation and appraisal in an efficient manner. The missions conducted under this
loan, and the resulting exchange of information and views through reports and aide-memoires were found
to be adequate for effective supervision of the project.
F. Borrower Performance
21.           EGAT has a record of implementing and completing its projects in a timely manner, with
substantial achievement of objectives set for its projects. As a utility, it is endowed with extensive
administrative, project management, procurement and technical expertise.  The objectives for the
combined cycle project were fully attained; however, the overall project experienced a delay of about a
year due to a number of implementation problems, as discussed in Section C. Some of these problems
were unavoidable and were beyond EGAT's control. A few, including problems arising from deficiencies
in the capabilities of workers on the project, performance and supervision of contractors, and maintenance
of an inventory of appropriate instruments, could have been avoided or minimized through more effective
project management, timely updating of skills amongst staff, and timely inventory maintenance.
22.           EGAT's successful project implementation and operation in lignite mining provides
evidence of strong project management, planning and supervision antecedents. Its increasing use of
contractors in overburden removal and other operations has resulted in substantial production cost
savings, despite adding complexity to pit management operations. EGAT's effective maintenance
operations for servicing equipment has resulted in high availability factors for shovels, trucks, bulldozers
and other equipment used in mining.
23.           Recent Bank audit reports have also confirmed the excellent capabilities and performance
record EGAT has had on recently concluded projects. Overall, EGAT's performance on the projects
under this loan has been satisfactory.
G. Assessment of Overall Outcome
24.           The overall outcome for the projects completed has been satisfactory for the following
major reasons: (a) the physical project components were completed with substantial achievement of
objectives set for each of the projects; (b) EGAT was in total compliance with the covenants agreed with
the Bank to ensure a strong outlook for the utility; (c) there were a number of institutional strengthening
initiatives implemented under this loan on the environment; (d) a number of concrete actions have been
initiated on environmental matters which would yield benefits in the future; and (e) resettlement and
compensation of villagers displaced from the Mae Moh mine expansion site has been completed
satisfactorily.

H. Future Operations
25.          To assess performance and maximize benefits for Blocks 3 and 4 of the Bang Pakong
combined cycle plant, EGAT and the Bank will monitor certain performance and cost parameters in the
future. The parameters to be monitored and assessed include plant availability, service and outage
factors; fuel efficiency; electricity generation; and plant operating, maintenance and fuel consumption
costs. EGAT will also continue to regularly monitor air quality around the plant and water quality in the
Bang Pakong river in the vicinity of the plant and at distances of a few kilometers up and downstream.
The air quality parameters to be monitored relate mainly to dust, sulfur and nitrogen based pollutant
levels in the atmosphere at and around the plant. Water quality monitoring will include the measurement
of physical and chemical concentrations in the Bang Pakong river and water temperature in the river at
intervals of a few kilometers up and downstream from the plant.
26.          The lignite mining component of the project has been operating according to the targets
intended, and EGAT plans to monitor and assess the following performance and economic parameters
to maximize benefits in future: annual production and cost of mining lignite, overburden removal and
cost of removal, equipment availability and service factors, and equipment maintenance costs.
Environmental impact with respect to the mining and power production operations at Mae Moh will
continue to be monitored and assessed as follows: (a) regular measurement of SO2, NO, and TSP levels
at various locations and monitoring stations around the Mae Moh complex and in the residential areas;
(b) regular measurement of physical and chemical characteristics of discharge water from the mine, power
plants, and downstream reservoirs and streams in the Mae Moh valley.
27.          In the intermediate term, pending installation of flue-gas desulfurization on power units
8-13 at Mae Moh, EGAT plans to minimize health effects and environmental impact in the valley by
instituting certain operational measures. Use of higher sulfur content seams from the Mae Moh mines
will be minimized, frequent and effective blending of appropriate quality lignite seams will continue to
be carried out and electricity generation at the complex will be reduced during periods when atmospheric
inversions are likely to occur. Plant maintenance work would be scheduled during periods when
atmospheric inversions are likely.
I. Key Lessons Learned
28.          The close relationship between the Bank, EGAT and the RTG has provided an effective
channel to conduct substantive in-depth discussions on policy, sector, regulatory and financial issues.
The dialogue has resulted in the implementation of significant initiatives to strengthen EGAT, its
generation and transmission operations, and its financial position.
29.          The concept of time-slice lending has proven to be quite successful, despite some initial
confusion. The project affirms that the time-slice approach provides the Borrower flexibility in arranging
financing for its large investment programs.
30.          With upsurge in infrastructure construction projects all over the world, in-house project
management, implementation and other capabilities need to be continuously updated to compensate for
deficiencies among contract workers and consultants. Paucity of good calibre contract services are likely



-8-
in future. Greater market intelligence on pricing outlook for equipment and services is also required to
ensure that projects are completed within approved budgets.

World Bank Mission July 4 - 13, 1994
1  A World Bank Mission comprising of Mr. Brahm Prasher (consultant) visted EGAT from July
4 to 13, 1994 for a field completion mission to prepare the Implementation Completion
Reports (ICRs) for the Power Transmission Project (Loan 2915-TH) and the Second Power
System Development Project (Loan 3138-TH). The mission gratefully acknowledges the
excellent cooperation and hospitality extended to it by EGAT. The Mission was also
favorably impressed with the level of assistance from EGAT in providing the Bank with
information on the financial, technical, environmental, implementation and operational
aspects of the projects.
2. EGAT and the mission discussed the borrowers role in preparing its final evaluation of the
projects implementation and operation experience, as required under the Loan Agreement,
including preparation of the summary reports which are to be attached to the ICRs. EGAT
will transmit its evaluation reports for the two projects, including the summary reports, within
three months of the present mission. The Bank will complete the draft ICRs on the projects
within approximately the same period and will transmit the drafts to EGAT for comment. The
main findings with respect to the ICR mission are as follows:
A. Power Transmission Proiect (Loan 291 5-TH)
3. The project has been completed satisfactorily and implementation objectives have been
substantially realized. Except for a relatively small fraction (less than 8%) of the 115 kV
transmission lines, all the components of the transmission project involving the 500 kV, 230
kV, the rest of the 115 kV transmission lines, and the numerous substations were completed
as planned during project appraisal. About 80% of the application softwares have been
implemented and are being used in day-to-day operations in the National and Regional
Control Centers. The Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is currently
being used for system monitoring, voltage and frequency control, and recently for controlling
equipment in some substations. EGAT plans to fully control all the substations using this
system by the year 1997.
4. The Load Frequency Control (LFC) function has been used since the National Control Center
has been in operation in 1992. The Economic Dispatch (ED) function has not been used due
to some system constraints which have not been overcome yet. As in the case of the ED,
the Unit Commitment (UC) function has not been utilized yet, due also to unresolved system
constraints. The function needs to be modified to affect coordination between hydro and
thermal generation within EGAT's power generation system
5. The mission and EGAT discussed the operational plan for maximizing the benefits of the
project in the future. To assess the operations and measure performance of the project in
the future, EGAT will monitor the indicators outlined in Attachment 1.
6. The mission notes that the Government is interested in insuring maximum reliability of the
power system in Thailand. The National Energy Policy Office (NEPO) has organized a
committee consisting of representatives from EGAT, MEA, PEA and NEPO to study and
analyze power system reliability issues. It is expected that the on-going study may result in
the formulation of a set of indices to monitor performance and reliability of the power system.
These indices may be available in future to serve as indicators to monitor performance and
reliability of the system.

B. Second Power System Development Proiect (Loan 31 38-TH)
7. The project has been completed satisfactorily. The production objectives for the Bang
Pakong Combined Cycle Blocks 3 and 4 (2x300 MW) and the Mae Moh Mine subproject
have been substantially achieved. The component of the project involving the construction
of a substation at South Thonburi has also been completed and is operating according to the
objectives expected for the component at appraisal. At this time, 87% of Loan 31 38-TH has
been disbursed and it is expected that the loan will be fully disbursed by the closing date in
September 1994.
8. The mission and EGAT discussed future operations for the project, and agreed that the
benefits for the project can best be assessed by monitoring indicators for the subprojects as
shown in the operational plan outlined in Attachment 2. The mission notes that EGAT is
constructing a cooling water facility at the Bang Pakong Power Plant, which is due for
completion by 1995. The objective for the facility is to lower the water temperature
discharged into the Bang Pakong river, so that the temperature differential between the
water at,the discharge point at the plant and water far upstream or downstream in the river
may be lowered appreciably. Completion of this facility is expected to insure that the
discharged water from the plant will have minimal impact on the ecology of the river
adjacent to the plant.

Financial Performance of Lignite Mine Directorate
1.        The financial performance of the Lignite Mine Directorate between FY89 and FY93 has
been exceptionally strong. In FY91, the Mae Moh lignite mine produced 11.6 MMt of lignite and
substantially surpassed the SAR target production of 9.5 MMt. Lignite production cost during the five
year period averaged 334 Baht/ton, with the nominal cost increasing slightly from 317 Baht to 340
Baht/ton in the period. When adjusted with the price deflator, the production cost of lignite in constant
1993 Baht actually decreased from 382 Baht/ton to 340 Baht/ton in the FY89-93 period. The decrease
in production cost can primarily be attributed to more efficient operations, especially with increasing
involvement of the private sector in overburden removal operations after the mid-1980's. The transfer
price of lignite, which is computed using net back calculations based on the price of imported coal,
averaged 462 Bahts/ton for the five year period, and ranged between 442 and 498 Baht/ton.
2.         Net income for the lignite mine operations increased from 928 million Bahts in FY89 to
1413 million Bahts in FY93. Between FY89 and FY92, years during which comparisons can be made,
actual net income for the Directorate averaged about 2.3 times the appraisal estimates. The debt to
equity ratio averaged 0.92 during the five year period and remained well below the Bank covenanted
ratio of 1.5 in each fiscal year. Debt service coverage ratio averaged 3.1 in the period and remained
substantially above the Bank mandated ratio of 1.3 in each fiscal year. The Directorate's financial
position during the period has been strong. As shown in the accompanying financial tables in Appendix
C, the Directorate has been able to cumulatively generate enough funds from its operations during
FY89-92 to fully self-finance its investment programs.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
EGAT's Power Development Plan (PDP)
1.           The projects financed under this Loan form part of EGAT's least cost expansion plan.
To confirm the economic viability of the plan, an adjusted Financial Rate of Return is re-evaluated as an
approximation of the Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR), on the basis of incremental cost and
benefit streams associated with the FY90-99 time-slice of EGAT's overall investment program.
2.           The methodology used in re-evaluating the rate of return is similar to that used in the
SAR. Capital costs are the investment costs of power plants and transmission system expansions which
will be completed by FY99. Fuel prices are based on actual values for FY90-94 and projected values
from FY94 onward. Economic costs of natural gas are estimates provided by the Petroleum Authority
of Thailand (PTT) based on contract terms for the purchase of gas. The cost of lignite is based on the
transfer price based on present estimates of reserves. Prices of other oil based fuels are based on
international prices. Operation and maintenance costs are based on actual costs and projections of present
trends for existing plants.  Transmission costs are based on unit costs and projected lengths of
transmission lines and transformer capacities. Administrative and general expenses are based on actual
costs in the first year and escalated at 3% p.a. in real terms.
3.           On the benefits side, total energy sales are assumed to increase from 56,558 GWh in
FY93 to 97,699 GWh in FY99. FY90-91 energy sales are valued at EGAT's average selling price, and
in FY92-94 energy sales are based on the tariff structure put into effect in FY91. For the period beyond
FY94, the projected selling price is based on realizing a self-financing ratio of 25 % on three year average
investments.
Bane Pakong Combined Cycle Power Component
4.           The IEER for the combined cycle power plant Blocks has been re-evaluated on a similar
basis as in the SAR on Loan 3027-TH, using a set of assumptions as in the case of the PDP for the
economic cost of natural gas and the electricity tariff. The plant factor has been assumed to be 82 %, the
efficiency 45 %, generation losses 2%, and the transmission loses at 1 %. Operation and maintenance
costs used for FY90-93 are based on actual costs, and have been projected at 2.8 % of the investment cost
after FY93.
Mae Moh Mine Expansion Component
5.           The methodology used for the re-evaluation of IEER for the Mae Moh Mine expansion
is similar to that used in the SAR. For the case in which lignite mine expansion and power generation
for Units 8 and 9 is treated as a single investment, the investment costs are the cost of the power plant
and lignite mine development, and the benefits are evaluated in terms of electricity sales. For the case
in which the mine development is treated as a single investment, the benefits consist of the net back value
of lignite calculated using the same method as in the SAR. The assumptions and detailed calculations to
obtain the net back value for FY93 is shown in Appendix C.

ENVIRONMENT
1.           EGAT has made substantial progress in response to agreements reached under this Loan
in implementing measures for strengthening its capabilities in environmental areas. EGAT has formalized
its environmental policies and objectives, and has restructured its Ecology and Environmental Division
by defining functions and organizing them around distinct areas of expertise. Staff training continues to
be emphasized, and consultant assistance and expertise has been used frequently to review monitoring
practices, conduct analysis, and to interpret wide-ranging environmental data being collected. Expatriate
consultant assistance had been used to train staff to enable it to conduct interpretive evaluation and
quantitative prediction of environmental impact. The US EPA and USAID has been involved in providing
assistance recently in air quality monitoring, modelling, SO2 control technology, and evaluation of health
impact. EGAT has also received technical assistance through the Australian Development Assistance
Bureau in preparing plans and strategies for water quality management and monitoring at the Mae Moh
complex.
2.           Environmental aspects of EGAT's facilities and development projects have received
increased emphasis from EGAT and agencies of the RTG connected with the environment. EGAT's
corporate plans for development of its mining and power plants have clearly stressed environmental issues
and strategies for mitigation of impact. The combined cycle blocks at Bang Pakong are at present
operating within the environmental standards required by the RTG and the Bank. With regard to the
operation of the Mae Moh Mining complex and power plants, several environmental issues still need to
be resolved (paras. 6 to 10). The specific conditions existent at each of the facilities and measures
expected to improve environmental quality are discussed separately for each of the sites.
Banm Pakon2 Power Plant
Air Quality
3.           Air quality is measured seasonally three times a year at the Bang Pakong plant site and
at three other locations away from the plant. Measurements of SQ, NO, and total suspended particulate
concentrations are made on a daily basis over periods approximating a week during each season. In
1993, the three sampling stations away from the plant were located within a radius of 6 km, generally
north of the plant (Wat Khao Din), east (Nerntaworn School), and northeast (Wat Chonlatee).
Monitoring results shown below indicate that the maximum pollutant levels on a 24-hour basis are well
within the RTG and Bank standards, except for the TSP level at the Nerntaworn School. The high TSP
level at this location is accounted for by the high road traffic near the school.

Water Ouality
4.           Monitoring of water quality in the Bang Pakong river has been conducted regularly, twice
a year during the wet and dry season at seven points between the river-mouth and a point upstream about
50 km from the river-mouth. The Bang Pakong river provides cooling and other water needs for the
plant, and receives the discharge treated water from the plant. Based on the analysis of the water in the
vicinity of the plant and at points several kilometers up and downstream of the plant discharge point, it
is apparent that the oil/gas fired plants exert little pollution effects on the river. Conductivity, turbidity,
dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, solid sulfate, chloride, heavy metallic species and other species levels in the
water at the discharge point and at points about 10 km up and downstream do not vary appreciably. The
water is generally of acceptable quality for natural surface water influenced significantly by tidal and
salinity effects from the sea. Historical trends, however, do indicate that the water quality in the Bang
Pakong river has deteriorated considerably due to significant upward growth trends in agricultural and
industrial activity. The effluent discharge from the plant is processed using a wastewater treatment
system in compliance with standards of the Ministry of Industries.

Thermal Diffusion
5.           The temperature distribution of the water up and downstream of the discharge point at
the plant is measured twice yearly. The isotherms obtained through these measurements show that with
simultaneous operation of all the thermal and combined cycle units (3,620 MW) the surface water
temperature in the vicinity of the plant up and downstream rises between 2 and 5 degrees Celsius (C)
above the average ambient temperature of the river (320 -33C). The rise in the temperature up and
downstream of the discharge point is appreciable, but the maximum temperature a few hundred meters
of from the discharge point is well below the Ministry of Industry standard of 40C. However, it is
probable that close to the discharge point, the temperature may at times reach above the 40C river water
standard prescribed by the Ministry of Industry, especially under certain tidal and wind conditions. To
ensure that the temperature standards are not exceeded, EGAT is slated to complete construction of
additional cooling tower capacity in mid-1995, as discussed in Section H.
Mae Moh Mine and Power Complex
Air Quality
6.           EGAT has in place an air quality monitoring network to monitor dust, NOx and S02
levels at the complex and in the surrounding villages and worker residential areas. NOx levels in the air
at the complex and surrounding areas are well-within standards accepted both by the RTG and the Bank.
In 1993, the total suspended particulate levels (TSP) on a 24-hour and annual basis outside the mining
areas have also been within the RTG and Bank standards. With increased levels of mining activity in
recent years, dust levels at the mine and surrounding areas have been contained by increased watering
of mining and overburden areas, and also frequent watering of haul roads and dusty areas within the
complex. Mae Moh lignite used to fuel all the power plants at the complex has sulfur content above
1.5%. SO2 ground level concentrations are monitored through eight continuous monitoring stations and
nine others which do not use continuous real-time analysis. In 1993, the S02 levels at all monitoring
stations have been found to be within RTG and Bank standards.
7.           In October 1992, unprecedented weather and atmospheric conditions led to high ambient
levels of S02 in nearby villages and worker residential areas, causing adverse impact on the health of a
significant number of residents. EGAT has put into effect short-term measures for operation of its plants
and quality control of the lignite used to fuel them, as discussed in Section H, to minimize health and
environmental impact. In the long-term, power units 8-13 will be retrofitted with flue gas desulfurization
units to substantially reduce SO2 emissions from the complex.  In addition, a study has been
commissioned to conduct analysis for providing sulfur capture devices on the older power plant units 1-7,
which are nearer the end of their useful life than units 8-13.
8.           At the time of the completion mission, EGAT was expecting completion of some studies
on air quality in the region. The study on acid deposition in Northern Thailand contracted out to an
expatriate and local group was due at the end of July 1994. The study on mountain top ecology at Mae
Moh was expected for completion at the end of 1994. An amount of US$1 million was originally
provided under this Loan for procurement of air quality monitoring equipment for enhancing the network

at Mae Moh and Bang Pakong. The procurement of this equipment has been postponed, pending
completion of related studies on revised requirements for network monitoring needs in conjunction with
the new developments evolving as a result of initiatives and studies underway.
Water Ouality
9.            Water quality in the Mae Moh basin is affected by effluent water from the power plants,
and contaminated water from the mine sumps and runoffs from the overburden dumps. Mine sump water
is used for dust control in the mine; however, excess rain water in the sumps is pumped out into the Mae
Moh reservoir. The runoffs from the overburden dumps are collected by perimeter drains and led to a
settling basin, overflows from which enter the mine sumps. Effluent water from the power plants is
treated before being discharged into the Mae Moh reservoir. Water quality at Mae Moh is measured
three to four times a year, and the water is sampled at 31 sampling stations, including at plant discharge
points, mine sumps and ponds, settling ponds, coal pile runoffs, supply and downstream reservoirs, ash
ponds, and other locations.
10.          Water quality within the Mae Moh mine is within the limits of standards set by the RTG.
However, despite the measures which had been taken by EGAT on quality and treatment, quality of water
downstream in Mae Moh has not improved in recent years, especially with respect to parameters such
as conductivity, total dissolved solid content, sulfate levels and hardness. Two settling ponds were
implemented in mid-1993, and two wetlands have been completed in 1994 to treat water from the settling
ponds. The effectiveness of these wetlands remained to be evaluated at the time of the completion
mission. Reclamation of the overburden dumps and mined out areas through re-vegetation of the land is
also an integral part of the action plan for reducing water pollution. The cost of re-vegetation is being
met from a fund set for reclamation, and conributions into this fund are made based on sales of each ton
of lignite. EGAT has enacted a time-bound program for improving water quality, and the Bank has
continued pursuit of this issue in its program under the Third Power System Development Program (Loan
3423-TH).
Resettlement
11.          The expansion of the Mae Moh lignite mine resulted in the displacement and relocation
of a whole village and parts of two other villages. In all, 6,155 villagers involving 1,796 families were
affected by the resettlement program. At the end of May 1994, 99.4% of the planned resettlement
program has been completed. The features and principles relating to the resettlement program has been
described in extensive detail in recent Bank documents, including the Project Completion Report on Loan
3027-TH (April, 1994). A brief description will suffice here.
12.          A total of 1,483 families opted for relocation in new resettlement areas provided by the
RTG. These families were provided with a choice of either opting for: (a) a residence and a farm plot,
each of 2,800 sq. m (1 Rai and 3 Ngan); or (b) a commercial plot of about 8 x 20 sq. m in the
resettlement area together with a cash compensation of Baht 46,000. A total of 313 additional families
opted for the entire cash compensation option of Baht 120,000 each and decided to relocate away from
the area.

13.           Of the 7,500 rais of land provided for the resettlement close to the Mae Moh complex,
6,500 rais were allocated to provide plots to the families resettled, and 1,000 rais were used to construct
community, government and public facilities. About 68 km of asphalt paved roads, 63 km of electrical
lines, and a water-supply system adequate to provide for household, community and agricultural needs
for the resettled families, were part of the facilities constructed under the program. In addition, EGAT
constructed buildings for government offices and facilities, and housing for government employees in the
area. EGAT also helped establish handicraft and vocational training centers, and agricultural and animal
husbandry demonstration projects to improve skills of the families affected by the relocation. The
resettlement area can boast of some of the most up-to-date community, municipal, recreational and public
facilities in rural Northern Thailand.

transmission lines was completed at a cost of USS412 million compared to tile estimate of USS333
million.
17.           Whiile procureaent of mosE of the auxiliary equipment for ,he Mae Moh lignite mine
under this Loan was completed two months earlier than estimate, it was completed with a two month
*   delay in June 1991 (Part 11. Table%W? The social works components, viz. water supply/diversion and
related civil works, were also delayed by about seven months to September 1992. Excluding IDC. the
completion cost for  Installation of the lignitle handling systcm, procurenent of auxiliary mining
equipment, water diversion, related civil works, resettlement for displaced villagers, and technical
support/training totalled US$142 million, about USS33 million above the appraisal estimate (Part 11, Table
8A). The lignite-halidling system and auxiliary mining equipment were procured/installed at a cost of
US$52 million, about USSI5 million above estimate. The social works component for the project,
financed in local currency, was completed at a cost of US$89 million, about lUS$17 million above
estimate. Contingencies totalling uss18 million for the overall project was not sufficicnt to cover the
increased costs for the lignite mine equipment and social works components. IDC for thc overall lignite
mining project was USS4.3 million. The South Thonburi substation whicil was appraised following
approval of the loan was completed in February 1993 at a cost of USS20.7 million, includinig IDC of
USSI.3 million. The eight-month delay In the completion of ithis project and the civil works component
of the lignite mine project can be attributcd partially to shortages and tight supply of cement in Thailand
during construction.

18.           Benefits from the project are likely to be sustained into the foreseeable future for the
following reasons:
a.     EGAT has in-place stanidard preventive and maintenance practices to cnsurc operability
and efficient functioning of its generation and transmission systems. Its workforce is
competent, experienced and adequately trained, and staff development is continuously
emphlasized within LiAT. CGAT's mine operations are lhighly efficient, and the Mine
Department's achlevements in the past l)avc amply demonstrated its capability to sustain
its operations.
b.     EGAT's financial performance lias been strong.  A tariff structure is in place based on
recapturing costs, producing an adequate return on capital, and to generating sufficient
(unds internally to finance 25% or more of its power development program. Impending
privatization actions also are likely to contribute further to EGAT's financial strength,
c.     The PrT has confirmed the availability of adequate natural gas to fuel the combined cycle
plant over its.4ifetlime. The plants financed under this loan are provided witlh dual firing
capabilities to enable use of distillates during gas supply emergencies.

Implementation Completion Reports (ICR)
Dear Mr. Nayyar,
Please refer to your letters dated May 15 and Hay 17, 19i95          ,        l
requesting our comment on the draft Implementation Completion Reports fog
the above-mentioned projects.  After a thorough review of the matt.ers,   l
we greatly appreciate the Bank effort in preparing these informatiIve
reports. However, we would like to bring to your attention as folJlovs:1
1. It would be more beneficial to EGAT in preparin4 futuri
proJects, if you could provide us with the deLailed reasons why the actu l
completion cost is higher than the estimated cost for the LN 2915jTH pro4ec. !
2. With regard to the Rate of Return on Revalued Assets (OR. 
we agree that the RoR of both projects for the first three years were loier             l
than the covenanted parameter because remittances to the governmeat werel               l
increased significantly.  However it should be noted that the inc eased
remittance to the government up to at least 3o percent is one of the cri,erlia
for being a good state enterprise under the Ministry of Finsmnce's;scheme l
This scheme provides many advantages to EGAT such as relaxing regulation p
on salary aad other remunerations.

3. For the calculation of Self-Financing Ratio (SFRp.
we would like to take this opportunity to request the Bank's views on
revenue from sale of EGAT's pouer plants, as to whether this part pf
income should be included in non-operating income.
We hope that our comments would be helpful to your reports
and hope to hear from you soon.
Sincerely yours,
