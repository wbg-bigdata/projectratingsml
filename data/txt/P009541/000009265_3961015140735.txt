MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S 2EPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A THIRD FLOOD REHABILITATION (EMERGENCY) PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for SDR 102.8 million (US$133.6
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be
on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years. The project aims to help
restore priority infrastructure damaged by flooding.
2.    Background.  Most of Bangladesh is a low-lying alluvial plain subject to
flooding from both heavy monsoon rainfall and snow-melt surges of two of the
world's largest rivers, the Brabmaputra and the Ganges. High ocean tides and
cyclones also cause serious flooding in southern coastal areas. About half of
the country is vulnerable to annual flooding to a depth of at least 30 centi-
meters, and one-sixth to depths of 1-4 meters. Floods in normal years are
tolerable because the farming systems are adapted to and benefit from the
floods through recharge of aquifers and improvements in soil fertility through
silt deposition. Two unusually severe floods occurred in 1987 and 1988. The
1988 floods, which peaked in August-September, surpassed previous records in
severity and extent in many areas of the country. The main cause was unusual-
ly heavy rainfall in the upper catchment areas of the Brahmaputra, Ganges and
Meghna rivers, just north of the Bangladesh-India border, and an unusual
simultaneous peak of the Brahmaputra and Ganges; high spring tides exacerbated
the problem. It is estimated that 53 of 64 districts, and 45 million of a
population of 110 million were affected, and that the whole country experi-
enced a flood of a return per od (the expected average frequency) of more than
fifty years. A recent study- indicates that the return period of the flood
of the Brabmaputra basin could be of the order of 1 in 100 years. The floods
caused considerable damage to standing crops. Through some replanting and
good yields in unaffected areas, much of this damage was mitigated.   Expecta-
tions of a good boro (winter) rice crop mean that total 1988/89 foodgrain
production may be close to 16.3 million metric tons, which is about the aver-
age for the last four years.
3.    In November 1988, a joint Government/United Nations task force reported
on the floods to a special meeting of the UN General Assembly. The report
contained a preliminary estimate of flood reconstruction and rehabilitation
costs (excluding housing) of US$1.1 billion. Together with damages to rural
housing estimated at US$953 million, and another US$100 million for a proposed
Dhaka city flood protection scheme, total reconstruction, rehabilitation and
flood protection costs were estimated at US$2.2 billion. A revised estimate,
1/    Flood Policy Study (Draft),  ponsored by the Government of Bangladesh and
UNDP.



-2-
excluding the bulk of private housing!/, of US$1.05 billion was subsequently
calculated by sectoral sub-groups working, with the assistance of consultants,
under the auspices of the Bangladesh Local Consultative Group (LCG). Table 1
in the Technical Annex gives the sectoral breakdown of this revised estimate
for infrastructure rehabilitation alone (i.e. excluding agricultural losses,
the proposed Dhaka city flood protection scheme, and housing rehabilitation).
The World Bank held an LCG meeting in December, 1988 to hLelp Government coor-
dinate the financing of the rehabilitation program, and, on the basis of this
meetirg and subsequent consultation with donors' local representatives in
Dhaka, the Bank prepared a matrix tentatively indicating possible assistance
from other donors for rehabilitation work (see Table 4 in the Technical
Annex).
IDA's Flood Assistance Strategy
4.    IDA's flood assistance strategy responds to Bangladesh's needs for flood
rehabilitation and flood control and preparedness over the short, medium, and
long term.
5.    IDA's short-term utrategy in response to the 1987 and 1988 floods has
included the reallocation of funds available under on-going credits, expansion
in the scope of planned new operations to include funding for rehabilitation
and the preparation of 'free-standing' flood rehabilitation credits. After
the 1987 floods, IDA reallocated US$21 million for flood rehabilitation from
funds available under four projects previously approved by the Board._3   IDA
also added flood rehabilitation components to two projects approved in FY88:
the Second Small-Scale Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation Project
(Cr.1870-BD, flood component US$42 million), and the Rural Roads and Markets
Improvement and Maintenance Project (Cr.1940-BD, flood component US$18.5
million). In addition, in FY88 IDA approved a Second Flood Rehabilitation
Project (Cr.1876-BD, US$25 million), making a total of about US$107 million
available for rehabilitation of damage from the 1987 flood. After the 1988
flood, the Development Credit Agreements (DCAs) for the Second Drainage and
Flood Control Project (Cr.1184-BD), the Second Small-Scale Flood Control,
Drainage and Irrigation Project and the Second Flood Rehabilitation Project
(both mentioned above) were amended so that funds available under those
projects could also be used for rehabilitation of damage from the 1988 floods.
The DCA for the Power Transmission and Distribution Project (Cr.1648-BD) is
being amended so that US$11 million from that project can be used for flood
rehabilitation. As a result, and excluding the proposed credit, a total of
about US$125 million will have been made available for rehabilitation work
needed after both floods. In addition, IDA proposes to make available US$8.1
million from the ongoing Third Population and Family Health Project (Cr. 1649-
BD) for rehabilitation of health infrastructure and restocking of medical
supplies depleted by the 1988 floods. It is also planned to amend the DCA for
2/    The bulk of private housing is excluded here because it is not part of the
Government's rehabilitation program.
31    Second Primary Education (Cr.1574-BD), Third Population and Family Health
(Cr.1649-BD), Rural Electrification (Cr.1262-BD) and Ashuganj Thermal Power
(Cr.1254-BD).



-3-
the Rural Roads and Markets Improvement and Maintenance Project (Cr. 1940-BD)
to permit the proceeds of the flood component to be used for rehabilitation
works arising from the 1988 as well as the 1987 floods.
6.    IDA's medium-term strategy has two main components.  First, taking into
account resources available from other donors, IDA will try to ensure contin-
ued funding for essential flood rehabilitation and prevention work: IDA fund-
ing will be made available through this proposed Third Flood Rehabilitation
Project, and through continued disbursements from the projects mentioned in
the preceding paragraph. Secondly, IDA will continue to help Government in
the mobilization of resources for, and in the coordination of, flood rehabili-
tation work. An LCG meeting was held in Dhaka in January 1989 to provide
overall coordination of donor flood rehabilitation efforts, and further assis-
tance was indicated by donors at the April 1989 Bangladesh Aid Grci!p meeting
in Paris.
7.    IDA's long-term strategy is to support and help coordinate efforts to
examine technically and economically feasible long-term measures to mitigate
the severity of the Bangladesh flooding problem. IDA is collaborating with
UNDP and the Government in the identification and preparation of a comprehen-
sive disaster preparedness project to improve flood forecasting, warning and
preparedness capabilities, including establishing an office of emergency
preparedness. A Second Cyclone Protection Project, which would support repair
and heightening of existing, and construction of new, coastal embankments, is
under preparation for possible future IDA financing. IDA is also engaged in
three flood control studies which may lead to IDA-financed projects: a river-
modelling and engineering study of the Brabmaputra and its tributaries
designed to produce a master plan of priority river training works; and two
studies of the Meghna, one a short-term study of immediate erosion problems,
the other a study similar to that of the Brahmaputra. Several other studies
of the problem are being undertaken by other donors, including a pre-feasibil-
ity study of flood control measures by a consortium of French engineering
companies sponsored by the Government of France, a recently completed study on
watershed management in the Ganges and Brabmaputra basins sponsored by USAID,
and a preliminary study of flood control sponsored by Japan. China is also
assisting Bangladesh on selected flood control issues, and the problem is
being studied by Task Forces and working groups set up on a bilateral basis
between Bangladesh on the one htand and India, Nepal, China and Bhutan. Based
on these various studies and initiatives, IDA expects to provide continuing
assistance to the Government to help it develop a long-term flood preparedness
and protection program, which fully takes into account all relevant economic,
financial, social, environmental and engineering considerations.4/
8.    Rationale for IDA Involvement.  As a major provider of development
assistance to Bangladesh, with heavy involvement in most of the sectors that
sustained flood damage, it is appropriate that IDA provide assistance for
flood rehabilitation as it did following previous floods.
41    For a fuller discussion of flood issues, see paragraphs 8-13 of the
Technical Annex.



-4-
9.    Project Obiectives.  The Project would restore priority infrastructure
damaged by flooding so as to promote efficient operation of the economy. It
would also aim to ensure appropriate design and location of works and equip-
ment to minimize the risks of damage or loss arising fzom future floods.
10.   Proiect Description.  The project would consist of: (a) rehabilitation
of irrigation, drainage and flood protection works (US$44.6 million); (b) re-
habilitation of roads and associated structures (for example bridges) (US$45.9
million); (c) repair and some reconstruction of primary schools (US$23.0
million); (d) repair of inland water transport facilities (US$16.0 million);
(e) repair of telecommunications facilities (t'S$15.0 million); (! rehabilita-
tion of urban infrastrt ture (US$9.3 million); and (g) provision of technical
services by local and foreign consultants (US$4.0).
11.   Project Execution.  The project would be executed by the respective
Government line agencies: irrigation, drainage and flood protection works by
the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB); roads and associated structures
by the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) and the Local Government Engineer-
ing Bureau (LGEB), which is the technical arm of the Local Government Division
(LGD) of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives;
primary schools by the Education Division (ED) of the Ministry of Education,
with implementation carried out by the Upazilas Parishads/l under the super-
vision and guidance of tne LGEB; inland water transport facilities by the
Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA); telecommunications
facilities by the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB); and urban
infrastructure by LGD, including LGEB. No coordinating committee is required
because each sub-component of the project is self contained.
12.   Selection of rehabilitation works by these implementing agencies would
be subject to the following criteria: (a) damage repairs to be undertaken
would be significant, and a consequence of the 1987 or 1988 floods, or works
which, if not unde;taken. will vitiate or seriously diminish the effectiveness
of other flood damage being repaired under the Project; (b) reconstruction
work would restore structures to their original specifications or to such
higher specifications, including necessary additions or alterations, as may be
warranted to ensure their optimal performance and integrity over a reasonable
life; tc) other external sources of finance would not be available; and (d)
the works and goods have been approved by the supervising consultants employed
under the Project. In the case of BTTB, an overall damage assessment was
provided by an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) mission which
visited Bangladesh for the purpose. The mission recommended repairs and
rehabilitation amounting to over US$100 million, and beyond the scope of this
proposed operation. A more detiiled assessment of rehabilitation needs in the
sector is now being carried out by consultants financed by the Norwegian Trust
Fund. This study will permit the selection from the ITU's proposals of
priority rehabilitation works for inclusion in the project; it would be a
condition of disbursement against the telecommunications component that
consultant proposals satisfactory to IDA had been agreed with Government.
Although some agencies had funds available for immediate rehabilitation work,
51    Administrative unit of Local Government.



*5-
in the cases of RED, LGD, BIWTA and BTTB there were insufficient funds avail-
able for flood tehabilitation under existing projects to finance crucial work
that has already been undertaken. Retroactive financing in aggregate not
exceeding US$4.5 million would therefore be permitted for expenditure incurred
after October :, 1988 for goods and services procured in accordance with bank
guidelines for use under the project, provided, however, that works undertaken
meet the criteria described above. A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and method of procurement and disburse-
ment, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Bangladesh are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Appraisal was
carried out by the staff of the Bank's Resident Mission in Bangladesh, but no
staff appraisal report was prepared because of the emergency rehabilitation
nature of the project.
13.   It is expected that the credit would be utilized approximately as
follows: BWPB--US$40.7 million; RHD--US$27.6 million; LGD--US$14.9 million
for roads; US$9 million for urban facilities; ED--US$19.9 million for schools;
BIWTA--US$11 million; and BTTB--US$10.5 million. Exceptionally, IDA will
finance 95 percent of project costs (net of duties and taxes) rather than 90
percent as is current practice; this is because the existing severe shortages
of local currency for the Annual Development Program, have been intensified by
the rehabilitation requirements created by the floods.
14.   Agreed Actions.  The project would be implemented over a three year
period and is expected to be completed by December 31, 1991. The Government
has agreed that: (i) selection of rehabilitation works will meet the agreed
criteria (paragraph 12); (ii) adequate funding for subsequent operations and
maintenance of the rehabilitated works will be provided; (iii) all works to be
constructed or improved under the project shall have design standards and
construction specifications acceptable to IDA; and (iv) as a condition of
disbursement for the telecommunications component the consultants will have
prepared rehabilitation proposals acceptable to Government and IDA.
15.   Benefits.  Without the restoration to be financed by this project, the
efficiency of road and irrigation systems would be seriously impaired, flood
protection and drainage systems would be in jeopardy, and the primary educa-
tion of children at 11,000 schools would suffer. There would be substantial
and continuing economic losses. For these reasons, the restoration of flood
damaged structures currently has one of the highest priorities for expendi-
tures in Bangladesh.
16.   Risks.  Delays in executing the project might result from institutional
bottlenecks, such as slow contracting of consultant's services; this slowed
implementation of the early stages of the Second Flood Rehabilitation Project.
The proposed project will have to overcome the usual implementation con-
straints In Bangladesh. The employment of consultants would help ensure that
only works arising from flood damage are undertaken, and that they are carried
out to appropriate design standards. Funding by IDA of 95 percent of project
costs on an exceptional basis will mitigate the local currency shortage
problem.

17.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

TECHNICAL ANNEX
BANGLADESH
THIRD FLOOD REHABILITATION (EMERGENCY) PROJECT
A. THE FLOODS
Physical Background
1.    The geography and climate of Bangladesh make annual flooding practically
inevitable. Most of Bangladesh is a low-lying alluvial plain criss-crossed by
24,000 kilometers of waterways (including three of the world's major rivers,
the Brabmaputra (Jamuna], Ganges and Meghna), draining a catchment area of
about 160 million hectares of which only about 7.5 percent lies in Bangladesh.
A fourth river system lies in the Southeastern Hill basin with a catchment
covering the limited hilly areas of Bangladesh and extending into neighboring
India. Rivers and streams in this basin are highly susceptible to flash
flooding.
2.    Flows in the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers are derived from snowmelt in
the Himalayas and rainfall in their lower catchment areas. Normal rainfall in
Bangladesh ranges from 1.25 meters in the southwest and west to more than 5
meters in the northeast. About 80 percent of the rainfall occurs during the
five-month monsoon season, May through September. Periods of intensive
rainfall result in flash flooding of the smaller rivers and general flooding
due to the inability of natural drainage systems to cope with the excess
water. Particularly destructive floods are most likely in July and August.
High ocean tides and cyclones are major causes of floods in southern coastal
areas. About one-sixth of the country is flooded every year to depths of 1-4
meters and about one-half of the country is vulnerable to annual flooding in
excess of 30 centimeters.
3.    Routine flooding during normal years yields benefits, including the
recharge of aquifers and improvement of soil fertility through silt deposi-
tion. Systems of farming that take advantage of, and are dependent upon,
annual flooding have evolved in routinely flooded areas. However, in years of
heavy flooding, major crop losses and substantial damage to rural and agricul-
tural infrastructure occur.
The 1988 Floods
4.    In 1987 and 1988 Bangladesh suffered very heavy flooding.  The 1988
floods were more severe and affected a larger area than did the 1987 floods.
The 1988 floods extended over parts or all of 53 of the 64 districts of
Bangladesh, directly affecting 45 million people, with over 1,600 deaths



-2-
directly attributable to floods, and another 735 deaths caused subsequently by
diarrheal diseases. In contrast, the 1987 floods affected 30 million people
in 56 districts, and resulted in over 1,800 deaths.
5.    The 1988 floods started in early May with flash flooding from the rivers
in the south-eastern hill basins.l   Another wave of flash floods occurred in
June, peaking around the 27th. Flood levels at that time, however, were lower
than the corresponding 1987 flood levels. In early July there was severe
flooding of the rivers in the Meghna basin because of heavy rainfall in the
Meghalaya. The flood exceeded the peak levels of 1974 and 1987. The storm
crossed over the Meghalaya, entered into the Assam Valley and caused flooding
in the rivers of the Brabmaputra basin, causing the Teesta, the Dharla and the
Brahmaputra to exceed their danger levels. The Brabmaputra remained at the
flood stage from early July and had two other peaks, on the 10th and 30th of
July, prior to the severe flood of August-September. The Ganges normally
peaks some weeks after the peak of the Brahmaputra. However, in 1988 a late
and extreme peak on the Brahmaputra coincided with a normal peak on the
Ganges. This coincidence, coupled with high tides, caused the severe
flooding. Out of 34 water level stations monitored, the highest recorded
flood lev.bs were exceeded at 10 stations.  The 1987 peak levels were exceeded
at 22 stations. The entire flood plain of the Ganges, the Brabmaputra and the
Meghna river systems of the country, including the cities of Dhaka, Narayan-
ganj and Tongi, was inundated. Most cities in the flood plains were affected
to varying degrees, depending on local conditions. It is estimated that the
whole country experienced a flood of a return period of more than fifty years.
Preliminary studies indicated that the return period of the flood of the
Brahmaputra basin could be of the order of 1 in 100 years.
6.     Crop Damage.  The damage to crops and livestock from the 1988 floods
was greater than the damage from the 1987 floods. Aman -- the main rice crop
planted in the summer -- suffered most from the floods, with 22 percent of the
area under aman affected. The cyclone in early December again damaged about
20 percent of the total planted/replanted aman area, although the crop loss on
this account alone is estimated at only 0.2 million tons. Together with
losses (of about 0.15 million tons) in the aus cro (harvested in July/August)
which was damaged by localized flooding earlier, total crop losses due to the
floods and the cyclone are now estimated at about 2.0 million tons, with total
aman and aus production being 0.8 million tons or 8 percent below last year's
(flood damaged) production. While this estimated loss is not as high as the
Government's early estimates in October (which suggested a 2.5-3.0 million
crop loss) it is still a major setback. Although Government's initiative to
increase winter crop production is expected to yield good boro and wheat
harvests, total foodgrain production for FY89 is presently estimated at about
16.35 million tons, or about 1 percent below last year's actual production,
and nearly 7 percent below the original FY89 production target. Damage to
other crops and livestock was also severe. Ten percent of the jute harvest is
estimated to have been damaged; and in the forestry sector, both private and
public nurseries suffered extensively. Livestock losses are estimated to be

Bangladesh/UNDP Flood Policy Study.



-3-
close to 200,000 large and small ruminants and 420,000 poultry; with shortages
of animal feed adding to malnutrition and weakening of draught animals.
Costs of the Floods
7.    In November 1988, a joint Government/United Nations task force reported
on the floods to a special meeting of the UN General Assembly. The report
contained a preliminary estimate of flood reconstruction and rehabilitation
costs (excluding housing) of US$1.1 billion. Together with damages to rural
housing estimated at US$953 million, and another US$100 million for a proposed
Dhaka city flood protection scheme, total reconstruction, rehabilitation and
flood protection costs were estimated at US$2.2 billion (line one, Table 4,
page 9). A revised estimate, of US$1.05 billion (line two, Table 4), was
subsequently calculated by sectoral sub-groups working, with the assistance of
consultats, under the auspices of the Bangladesh Local Consultative Group
(LCG); this revised estimate excludes the bulk of damages to the private
sector because it is not included in the Government's rehabilitation program.
Table 1 on page 4 gives the sectoral breakdown of this revised estimate for
infrastructure rehabilitation alone which totals US$750 million. The LCG sub-
groups also helped prepare a matrix tentatively indicating possible assistance
from other donors for rehabilitation work (Table 4). Table 2 on page 4 gives
a summary of the sub-groups' estimates of physical damage.2  In human terms,
an estimated 45 million people were affected, with over 2,300 deaths -- about
1,650 from drowning and the rest mainly from diarrhoeal disease. In addition.
many millions suffered from crop losses and from reduced employment opportun-
ities. and from resulting undernourishment.
Response to the 1988 Flood Disaster
8.    Flood Warning. Prior to the 1987 and 1988 floods, Bangladesh had estab-
lished, with UNDP and World Meteorological Organization assistance, a Flood
Forecasting and Warning Center. The Center monitors rainfall and water
levels, and issues daily bulletins, accompanied by forecasts for the Brabma-
putra and Ganges Rivers and flash-flood prone rivers in the southeast. These
forecasts provide key data for the organization of the Government's response
to flood disasters. Unfortunately, there have been difficulties in getting
timely data about water levels and transmitting warnings through to the pub-
lic, especially at the village level. This has highlighted the urgent need to
improve and strengthen the warning system; this issue will be part of the
UNDP-sponsored Flood Policy and Preparedness Studies mentioned in paragraph 11
below.
9.    Flood Disaster Response.  In the event of a flood disaster, all agencies
of the Government, including the armed services, are mobilized. Coordination
of immediate relief efforts is provided by a Central Coordination Committee on
Flood Relief and Rehabilitation made up of the secretaries of appropriate
2/    None of these estimates attempts to distinguish between unrepaired damage
from the 1987 floods and new damage from the 1988 floods, since the
Government had not fully completed rehabilitation works in response to the
1987 floods when the 1988 flood occurred.

Ministries. The Committee decides on the Government's response to the ilouds,
and on relief policies to be followed, and allocates responsibilities accord-
ingly. Implementation is usually monitored by an operations center located in
Dhaka. First priority is given to essential evacuation, followed by food
distribution, restoration of communications, provision of shelter and cloth-
ing, cash assistance, and finally, as flood recede, programs of preventive
medicine and agricultural rehabilitation. The Ministry of Relief Rehabilita-
tion coordinates relief operations carried out by Non-Governmental Organiza-
tions (NGOs), and the External Resources Divisijn, in cooperation with the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, mobilizes foreign assistance and monitors relief
and rehabilitation efforts. The response system has generally worked
adequately, but can be significantly improved through intensified pre-disaster
preparedness planning and training. The UNDP-sponsored flood preparedness
project is exmining this issue (see paragraph 11 below).
10. Government Response. As indicated above, the Government handled the
flood emergency well, having acquired considerable experience in managing
relief activities, foodgrain procurement and distribution, and aid donor co-
ordination. On September 3, 1988 the Government formally launched an appeal
for international assistance and subsequently held several briefings tor the
donor community. In addition, the donor community, including representatives
of NGOs, met several times under the chairmanship of the UNDP to share infor-
mation as to needs and proposed assistance. Throughout the emergency, Govern-
ment's interaction with the donor community was excellent.  As a result, pled-
ges were quickly received for close to 400,000 metric tonnes of incremental
food aid. In addition, a wide range of emergency relief donations was receiv-
ed from international, bilateral and NGO donors including cash, medicines and
seeds. Government line agencies were also instructed to carry out urgent
damage and rehabilitation assessments. These assessments, conducted with some
outside support, became the basis for the joint task force report referred to
in paragraph 7 above. As in 1987, the Ministry of Agriculture moved quickly
to prepare and implement a recovery program. Its effectiveness is, as mention-
ed above, already demonstrated by the good winter (boro) rice crop.
11.   Government/IDA/IUNDP Flood Studies.  The severity of the 1988 floods
prompted the Government to undertake a comrrehensive review of flood policy.
UNDP is financing a study on Flood Policy 4 which is now being finalized; it
is also financing a Flood Preparedness Study. IDA is collaborating with UNDP
in the comprehensive disaster preparedness project, which would improve flood
forecasting, warning and preparedness capabilities, including establishing an
office of emergency preparedness. IDA is also engaged with Government in
three flood control studies which may lead to IDA-financed projects: a river-
modelling and engineering study of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries
designed to produce a master plan of priority river training works; and two
studies of the Meghna, one a short-term study of immediate erosion problems,
the other a study similar to that of the Brabmaputra.
12.   Other Donor Initiatives.  Apart from the UNDP financed Flood Policy
Study, a number of donors responded to the 1988 floods by initiating or

financing flood studies. The USAID has sponsored a recently completed study
and the Government of France is financing a pre-feasibility study for flood
control in Bangladesh which is now nearing completion.51 On the initiative of
the Government of Bangladesh bilateral Task Forces and working groups have
been set up between Bangladesh on the one hand and India, Nepal, China and
Bhutan to examine various aspects of the flood problem. China is also
assisting Bangladesh on selected flood control issues, while Japanese flood
control experts have recently prepared a preliminary study on flood control in
Bangladesh.
13.   Flood Preparedness, Mitigation and Control.  The findings of the various
studies, some of which are still pending completion and therefore must be
considered as preliminary, suggest a wide range of structural and non-struc-
tural approaches for assisting Bangladesh to cope with the flood problem.
Some of the proposals for flood control of deep flooding include the construc-
tion of major embankments along the main rivers in Bangladesh. Such major
engineering schemes will need to be carefully examined as to their technical
feasibility, economic justification and environmental and social impact, as
well as financial viability in view of their likely cost. When these studies
are complete, it would be desirable that their various findings and proposals
be reviewed with the objective of assisting the Government in formulating a
viable strategy for dealing with the flood problem. IDA expects to be closely
associated with other donors in this effort.
B. PREVIOUS BANK-FINANCED DISASTER RELIEF PROJECTS IN BANGLADESH
14.   On November 12 and 13, 1970 a cyclone struck coastal districts of what
was then East Pakistan killing as many as 500,000 people and causing enormous
damage. Due to the war of liberation, the reconstruction program made little
progress, but after independence, a cancelled IDA-assisted rehabilitation
project was re-appraised and relaunched as the Coastal Area Rehabilitation and
Cyclone Protection Project (Cr. 339-BD, for US$25 million), on October 18,
1972. Eight categories of investments in the devastated area were financed
involving seven implementing agencies. The project took seven and a half
years to complete instead of the three years foreseen at appraisal. In
addition to problems in procurement, supervision and physical access, the
complex organization of the project, involving an unnecessary coordinating
board, was identified as a principal reason for slow implementation.
15.   The second IDA-assisted disaster rehabilitation project, the Flood
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1587-BD for US$30.0 million) was signed on
April 11, 1985. This project was a response to the disastrous flooding which
occurred during the 1984* monsoon. The project was processed as an emergency
5I    Eastern Waters Study: Strategies to Manage Flood and Drought in the Ganges-
Brabmaputra Basin, prepared for USAID by the Irrigation Support Project
for Asia and the Near East; Prefeasibility Study for Flood Control in
Bangladesh, under preparation by a French Engineering Consortium and
Bangladesh Water Development Board, in association with Bangladesh
Engineering and Technological Services Ltd.

operation by both IDA and Government, and followed abbreviated procedures.
Reflenting experience with the earlier project, this project was designed to
be implemented directly, without central coordination, by the four concerned
agencies. Project implementation progressed reasonably satisfactorily, and
the credit was closed on schedule on December 31, 1987. An important lesson
from this project was that consultants for implementation assistance and
monitoring must be in place early to assist in selection and to supervise
implementation of works. Under the project, consultant appointments were
delayed and there was initially some suboptimal selection and implementation
of work. Also, low standards of design and construction, which reduce the
ability of embankments, bridges, schools and other infrastructure to withstand
even normal 'looding, must be addressed through early consultant appointment.
16.  A Second Flood Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1876-BD, US$25 million) was
prepared and processed on an emergency basis in response to the floods which
swept Bangladesh between July and September 1987. This was signed on February
19, 1988, and after a slow start due to the late release of Government funds
implementation hai improved and the project is expected to be completed and
closed on schedule on June 30, 1989. The project has been complemented by
several other flood response measures: IDA has added flood rehabilitation
components to two projects: the FY88 Second Small-Scale Flood Control,
Drainage and Irrigation Project (Cr.1870-BD, flood component US$42 million),
and the FY88 Rural Roads and Markets Improvement and Maintenance Project
(Cr.1940-BD, flood component US$18.5 million). IDA has also reallocated US$21
million available under four previously approved projects.17 Together these
actions have made available about US$107 million of IDA resources for rehabil-
itation of damage from the 1987 floods. After the 1988 flood, the Development
Credit Agreements (DCAs) for the Second Drainage and Flood Control Project
(Cr.1184-BD), the Second Small-Scale Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation
Project and the Second Flood Rehabilitation Project (both mentioned above)
were amended so that funds available under those projects could also be used
for rehabilitation of damage from the 1988 floods. The DCA for the Power
Transmission and Distribution Project (Cr.1648-BD) is being amended so that
US$11 million from that project can be used for flood rehabilitation. As a
result, a total of about US$125 million will have been made available for
rehabilitation work needed after both floods. In addition, IDA proposes to
make available US$8.1 million from the ongoing Third Population and Family
Health Project (Cr. 1649-BD) for rehabilitation of health infrastructure and
restocking of medical supplies depleted by the 1988 floods. It is also
planned to amend the DCA for the Rural Roads and Markets Improvement and
Maintenance Project (Cr.1940-BD) to permit the proceeds of the flood component
to be used for rehabilitation works arising from the 1988 as well as the 1987
floods. Table 3 on page 8 shows the sectoral and project distribution of
IDA's funds uncommitted and available for flood rehabilitation, along with
estimated damages in the respective sectors, and Table 4 shows indications of
possible assistance from other donors for rehabilitation.
Second Primary Education (Cr.1574-BD), Third Population and Family Health
(Cr.1649-BD), Rural Electrification (Cr.1262-BD) andAshuganj Thermal Power
(Cr.1254-BD).

C. THE PROJECT
Objectives
17.   The proposed project is the lead element of IDA's medium-term response
to the floods described in paragraph 6 of the Memorandum of the President. It
is intended to provide assistance for priority rehabilitation works. These
works would be carried out over a period of three years, beginning with
urgently required works to be executed in the 1988189 construction season in
order to provide at least some measure of protection prior to the onset of the
1989 monsoon season. The rather long time horizon for an emergency operation,
three years, is necessitated by the magnitude of the outstanding damage rela-
tive to implementation capacity. The outstanding damage includes substantial
damage from the 1987 floods which could not be repaired before the onset of
the 1988 floods, or was damaged again by the 1988 floods.
18.   The proposed project was prepared and appraised by the staff of the
Bank's Resident Mission with the assistance of headquarters staff visiting
Bangladesh. Reflecting the emergency nature of the operation, conventional,
detailed appraisal was not undertaken and a Staff Appraisal Report was not
prepared.
19.   In lieu of conventional project preparation and detailed appraisal, it
was agreed with Government that consultants would be employed by four of the
agencies involved7/, to verify the agencies' own damage assessments, to
prepare lists of works/goods to be included under the project, and subsequent-
ly to provide monitoring and technical assistance during implementation (para-
graph 28 et seq). In the case of the education component, the large number
and remote locations of damaged primary schools makes an up-front, detailed
damage assessment by consultants impractical. In addition, the workload of
the Directorate of Primary Education from the ongoing Second Primary Education
Project and the repair of 1987 flood damages is so heavy as to make it inad-
visable to give DPE responsibility for implementing the repairs of 1988 flood
damage. Instead, it is proposed that the Education Division JD) of the Min-
istry of Education entrust this work to the Upazila Parishads_/ under the
supervision of the LGEB, with local consultants hired to assist them to
prepare action plans for rehabilitation and reconstruction and to monitor the
progress of work during implementation. The amount of primary school damage
proposed for inclusion in the project has been assessed by Bank headquarters
staff taking account of implementation capacity and the proposed duration of
the project. All priority requirements will be met. In the case of BTTB an
overall damage assessment was provided by an International Telecommunication
Union (ITU) mission which visited Bangladesh for the purpose. The mission
recommended repairs and rehabilitation amounting to over US$100 million, much

of it for upgrading facilities. This was beyond the scope of this proposed
operation. A more detailed assessment of rehabilitation needs in the sector
is now being carried out by consultants financed by the Norwegian Trust Fund.
This study will permit the selection of priority rehabilitation works from the
ITU's proposals for inclusion in the projectt it would be a condition of
disbursement against the telecommunications component that consultant propo-
sals satisfactory to IDA had been agreed with Government. Agreement on
further consultant responsibilities, described below, were agreed at negotia-
tions. Arrangements are largely the same as agreed under the second project;
sole source hiring would be resorted to speed the process, where appropriate
with the same consultants already at work under the earlier project.
Components
20.   This project would comprise priority components of the Government's
program to rehabilitate flood damaged infrastructure and equipment and would
include:
(a)   rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage and flood protection
works;
(b)   rehabilitation of roads and associated structures (e.g. bridges);
(c)   reconstruction and repair of primary schools;
(d)   repair of inland water transport facilities;
(e)   repair of telecommunication facilities;
(f)   rehabilitation of urban infrastructuret and
(g)   provision of tecbnical services by local and foreign
consultants.
21.   The project, though an emergency operation, would be implemented over
three years, reflecting the magnitude of the outstanding damage from two
successive floods, and available implementation capacity. The proposed
project completion and credit closing dates are December 31, 1991 and June 30,
1992 respectively. The project would be esecuted under the overall super-
vision of six agencies: B3DB, RBD, LGD of the Ministry of Local Government,
Rural Development and Cooperatives, including its technical arm, the Local
Government Engineering Bureau (LGEB), the Education Division (ED) of the
Ministry of Education, BIWTA, and the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board
(BTTB). The implementing agencies would ensure that rehabilitation works
financed under the Project were executed in accordance with design standards
and construction specifications satisfactory to IDA. Schemes on international
waterways that could adversely affect riparian countries would not be selected
for implementation under the project. A more detailed description of project
components follows.
22.   Rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage, and flood protection works
(B3WDB). Of the works to be carried out by BWDB, about two-thirds would be



-12-
improvements to existing structures to minimize damage from future floods, the
balance would comprise direct damage repair. About 60 percent of the total
program would be for the repair and improvement of protection works, mainly at
sitts where rivers threaten densely populated areas. Works on major rivers
would initially be limited to emergency measures pending completion of
required modelling studies to permit the preparation of designs for permanent
solutions. Just under 30 percent of the proposed program would be for the
repair of embankments and about 10 percent for repairs to structures, e.g.
sluice gates. A small amount of canal repair would also be undertaken.
23.   Restoration work on roads and associated structures (RHD and LGD).  Road
works financed under the project and carried out by RHD and LGD would include
compacted filling of embankment breaches; the resectioning, strengthening, and
protecting of eroded embankments; and reconstruction of damaged culverts,
bridges, and retaining walls. Road surfaces would include the restoration of
road shoulders and the repair and strengthening of damaged pavement. Addi-
tional drainage and culverts would be provided in reconstructed and strength-
ened embankments and where otherwise appropriate. Road works would be
restricted to the western half of the country, since ADB is financing recon-
struction works in the eastern half.
24.   Reconstruction and repair of primary schools (ED).  The project would
reconstruct and provide furniture for about 800 primary schools destroyed by
the floods, spread throughout the flood-affected upazilas. This would be in
addition to the 2,100 schools which i!t was agreed would be reconstructed
following the 1987 floods. The destroyed schools were all of the rudimentary
type of construction but would be rebuilt to the standards of the Second
Primary Education Project (which, through reallocation of savings is also
financing primary school reconstruction following the 1987 floods) except that
consideration will be given to raised foundations in appropriate locations to
provide flood refuges. The project would also finance the repair of 7000
flood damaged primary schools nationwide.
25.   Repair of inland water transport facilities (BIWTA).  Assistance to the
BIWTA would comprise restitution of direct flood damage and provision of
additional facilities which, though not arising from direct flood damage, are
essential to BIWTA if it is to be able to restore the waterway network to an
acceptable level of service efficiency. Restitution of direct damage would
comprise repairs to buildings and terminals, jetties and ferry ghats, remedial
dredging, and replacement of lost or damaged hydrographic survey and dredging
equipment, and pontoons and navigational aids. In addition to this restitu-
tion of direct damage, two vessels now at the end of their economic life, a
buoy tender vessel and a crane boat, would be replaced so as to help restore
the waterway network to an acceptable level of service efficiency. The former
is essential for buoy placement and maintenance and the latter for dredging
operations. Modern hydrographic survey equipment would also be provided to
BIWTA to enable it to respond adequately to the dramatic changes in river bed
topography which resulted from the floods. In addition, some additional
dredging equipment and remedial dredging would be provided for.
26.   Repair of telecommunication facilities (BTTB).  Damage to these facilit-
ies was extensive, and a thorough review of the placement and type of equip-



-13-
ment used is required before remedial work is undertaken. Under this project
only priority repairs would be undertaken. These are being identified by
consultants financed by the Norwegian Trust Fund (paragraph 19).
27.   Rehabilitation of urban infrastructure (LGD).  About 40 pourashavas
(small municipalities) suffered damage to their infrastructure, including
roads, culverts, drains, and sewers. The project would provide for priority
repairs to these.
28.   Provision of technical services.  The technical services to be included
in the project are described below. To facilitate speedy engagement of
consultants it was agreed with Government that initially any readily available
source of funds would be used until funds became available under the proposed
credit. Thus the Australian Government financed the damage assessments by
Snowy Mountain Engineering Company for highways, rural roads and inland water
transport facilities. USAID financed those for pourashavas (small municipal-
ities), and the contracts of the consultants retained by BWDB under the Second
Flood Rehabilitation Project, and financed by IDA, were extended to cover 1988
flood related work. The arrangements for education and telecommunications
were discussed in paragraph 19 above.
29.   The technical services included in the project would comprises
(i)   Consultants employed to verify damage assessments produced
by Government agencies and to compile prioritized listings
of works to be included in the project;
(ii) Consultant services to assist in the implementation of project
activities. Consultant's responsibilities would include: (a)
checking that all sub-projects selected for financing under the
credit are consistent with the criteria agreed between the
Government and IDA, (b) approval of the design of project works,
preparation of detailed design and bid documents where necessary
for this project, and preparation of plans and estimates and of a
program for implementation, (c) supervision of project works,
including monitoring the quality and progress of project works,
(d) preparation of progress and completion reports, and (e)
contributions to the production of the Project Completion Report
that the Government would prepare for the project. It is estim-
ated that the implementing agencies would require 150 staff-months
of foreign consultant services and 1700 staff-months of local
consultant services. All of the staff-months required would be
the services of mid-level engineers and above.
30.   The qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment of
consultants under the project would be satisfactory to IDA.



-14-
D. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
31. The project would be implemented by BYDB, RHD, LGD, ED, BIWTA and BTTB
and would be completed by December 31, 1991. There would be no need for
coordination at a higher level. Each agency's basic programs have been
reviewed and approved by their respective Ministries and by the Planning
Commission.
32.   BWDB would be responsible for reconstruction work under the project's
flood control, drainage and irrigation component. BWDB is under the admini-
strative control of the Ministry of Irrigation, Water Development and Flood
Control and is managed by a Chairman and five board members responsible,
respectively, for planning, implementation, operation and maintenance, finance
and administration. In the field, BWDB is organized under a geographic system
of zones supervised by Chief Engineers, circles under Superintending Engineers
and divisions under Executive Engineers who handle both new construction and
the operation and maintenance of completed structures. Reconstruction of
works would be the responsibility of Executive Engineers under the supervision
of their circle Superintending Engineer and zonal Chief Engineer. The
responsibilities of Executive Engineers would include, with assistance of the
consultants, preparation of tender documents; selection of contractors and
award of contracts; and construction supervision and quality control. They
would also be responsible for implementation of a relatively small amount of
works under force account, and for accounting and detailed financial control.
Design assistance, when required, would be provided by BWDB's central Design
Directorate, and by the consultants. The Chief Engineer, Monitoring and
Evaluation, would act as the principal contact of IDA for project matters.
33.   Administration of the principal road network is the responsibility of
RHD, a department of the Roads and Road Transport Division of the Ministry of
Communications. RHD is responsible for road design, construction and mainten-
ance and for the installation and operation of truck, car and passenger
ferries. its Chief Engineer is the chief executive. The field organization
of RHD is similar to that of BVDB and under the project the Department's
Executive Engineers would have primary day-to-day responsibility for recon-
struction work. The Additional Chief Engineer at ROD headquarters has been
designated as the principal contact with IDA for project-funded activities.
Procurement of portable bridging would be under the overall management of
RHD's Additional Chief Engineer, Foreign-Aided Projects Wing.
34.   The restoration of flood-damaged rural roads and municipal infrastruc-
ture outside Dhaka, whose maintenance is the responsibility of Zilla (Dis-
trict) Parishads and municipalities, would be executed by LGEB of LGD which is
headed by a Secretary. The country's 64 districts and 86 municipalities have
their own engineering departments which are funded by locally generated taxes
and central Government grants. Most Zilla Parishads have an Executive
Engineer in charge of their engineering departments, but municipal engineers
are usually of the lower sub-divisional engineer or more junior grades. The
implementation of LOD work would be the responsibility of the engineers in
charge of the districts or the municipalities concerned and would include,
with the assistance of the consultants, tendering and awarding of contracts
and first level supervision. They would also be responsible for payments to



-1S-
contractors and maintenance of accounts. Overall supervision would be by LGEB
whose chief executive is the Engineering Adviser. One of LGEBs' superintend-
ing engineers would be appointed for IDA liaison.
35.   Execution of the primary school component (the content of which has been
decided by the Ministry of Education with the advice of Upazila Education
Officers), would be the responsibility of ED, although implementation would be
entrusted to the respective Upazila Parishads. These would work under the
supervision and guidance of LGEB, which in turn would be assisted by local
consultants hired for the purpose. The consultants would assist the Upazila
engineers prepare implementation action plans which would, importantly, pay
particular attention to establishment and maintenance of financial records, a
matter that has given rise to concern under other projects.
36. BIWTA would implement the inland water transport component. BIVTA is an
agency of the Ministry of Shipping, and is responsible for the development and
control of inland ports, and the preparation of regulations governing inland
water transport and waterways. Its functions include waterways and river
conservancy, navigational regulations and aids, and improvement of inland
water traffic. BIWTA has a Board headed by a Chairman who serves as chief
executive. Consultants would be engaged to assist BIWTA with aspects of the
civil works program and with the modernization of the hydrographic survey
system. Procurement of equipment, materials and vessels would be handled
centrally by BIWTA's Purchase and Storage Department with the assistance of
the consultants. Repair and replacement of pontoons would be implemented by
the Conservancy and Pilotage Department, replacement of buoys and pontoons by
the Mechanical and Marine Engineerirg Department and jetty repair by the
Engineering Department. BIWTA's Director of Planning would serve as liaison
officer and principal contact with IDA for the execution of project-funded
activities.
37. BTTB would implement the telecommunication component. BTTB is under the
administrative control of the Ministry of Post and Telecomunnication.  It has
a Board headed by a Chairman who serves as Chief Executive. There are four
board members responsible, respectively, for Maintenance and Operation,
Planning and Development, Finance, and Administration. Field operations are
organized under four geographic regions for maintenance and operations and two
regions for construction work. Each region is supervised by a General Manager
and supported by at least one Director. Each region is sub-divided into a
number of divisions, and Divisional Engineers are responsible for operation,
maintenance and construction work according to the type of region. At the
center there is a Planning Cell, under the Member (Planning and Development --
P&D), supervised by a General Manager, which is responsible for all develop-
ment work. Under the Member (P&D), there is also a Directorate for Building
and Construction which is responsible for all large development construction
works. Reconstruction and rehabilitation work would be the responsibility of
the Member (P&D) who would be the principal contact for IDA for project
matters. The General Manager (P&D) would have direct responsibility for
implementation. He would be responsible for preparation of tender documents,
selection of contractors and award of contracts. The Director (Building and
Construction) would provide supervision for construction works. Accounting
and financial control would be the responsibility of the Member (Finance).



-16-
Selection of Goods and Works for Inclusion in the Proiect
38.   In the final selection of project works (including goods) the implement-
ing agencies and their consultants would ensure that, inter alia, the works
selected were consistent vith criteria satisfactory to IDA as follows:
(a)   works to be undertaken would be:
(i) a consequence of the 1987 or 1988 floods, or works which, if
not undertaken, will vitiate or seriously diminish the
effectiveness of other flood damage being repaired under the
Project; and
(ii) of significant nsture, not include minor works of deferred
maintenance, and have an estimated value of Tk500,000 or
more for RHD components and Tk200,000 or more for LOD
components;
(b)   reconstruction would restore structures to their original specifi-
cations or to such higher specifications, including necessary
additions or alterations, as may be warranted to ensure their
optimal performance and integrity over a reasonable life;
(c)   other external sources of finance would not be available; and
(d)   the works have been approved by the supervising consultants.
Proposals for works involving expenditures of over US$500,000 would be
submitted to IDA for prior review and approval.
Proiect Costs
39.  Total project costs (Table 5) are estimated at US$157.8 million includ-
ing duties and taxes estimated at US$17.3 million, with a foreign exchange
component of US$40.2 million or 25.5 percent of total costs. Estimates are
based on late 1988 prices. Contingencies have not been included because of
the nature of the project, which takes the form of a multisectoral program.
The February 1989 exchange rate of US$1 - Tk32.3 has been used throughout.
Proiect Financing
40.   The proposed IDA credit of US$133.6 million would cover about 95 percent
of the project costs net of duties and taxes. Government's US$24.2 million
share of costs would include all duties and taxes, and about US$6.9 million of
other local costs. The proceeds of the IDA credit and the Government's con-
tribution would be passed on to the implementing agencies through budgetary
allocations.

41. Bangladesh operates a complex and formal allocation process for its
Annual Development Program (ADP). Two features of the process are particular-
ly importants (a) approval by the Economic Committee of the National Executive
Council of a Project Proforma for each new project to be included in the ADP
(without which, no expenditures can be made on the project); and (b) alloca-
tion within each ADP of funds for each year of implementation of specific
projects. In the case of the proposed project, the Government has decided
that the Project Proforma process will be waived and block allocations
adequate to cover all project costs will be provided under the Annual Develop-
ment Programs.
42. Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing in aggregate not exceeding
US$4.5 million>/ (equivalent to less than 4 percent of the credit) would be
permitted for expenditure incurred after October 1, 1988 for goods and ser-
vices procured by the agencies in accordance with Bank guidelines for use
under the project, provided, however, that works undertaken meet the criteria
set out in paragraph 38.
Procurement
43. International competitive bidding (ICB) would not in general be appro-
priate for civil works contracts. There are a number of reasons for this: (i)
the project involves work at a large number of sites scattered throughout
Bangladesh; (ii) all contracts are of a relatively low value; (iii) the dis-
persal of sites and small contract values makes the packaging of works into
single contracts of sufficient value to attract foreign bidders impracticable;
(iv) most of the works are labor-intensive, involving a minimum of equipment,
and easily and cheaply organized by small local contractors; and (v) the time
involved in letting contracts through ICB would delay the start of works.
Civil works contracts would be let through the existing procedures of the
implementing agencies for local competitive bidding (LCB) among pre-qualified
contractors; such procedures are satisfactory to IDA. There would be a
limited amount of force account work (not exceeding US$5.9 million -- US$5.3
million for IDA financed procurement) for emergency works such as those
arising from imminent threats to town protection works, roads and embankments
and appurtenant structures, waterways and pontoons. For ecuipment some
procurement (about US$16.1 million -- IDA US$10.0 million) would be through
ICB. ICB would be used for the majority of instruments, gauges and vessels to
be procured by BIWTA. Portable steel bridging required by RHD (about US$2.9
million -- IDA US$1.7 million), for which there is a limited number of sup-
pliers, would be procured through Limited International Bidding (LIBI in
accordance with World Bank guidelines.  A small amount of equipmentl!/ for
BIWTA could be procured through direct contracting where goods of a propriet-
ary nature are needed for replacement purposes. Pontoon repairs, buoys, and
related items required by BIWTA would be procured through LCB. Review and
9/    The breakdown between agencies would be as follows: RHD: US$3 million;
LGDs US$0.5 million; BIWTAs US$0.5 million; BTTB: US$0.5 million.

dredger parts and services.

approval by IDA prior to award would be required for all contracts estimated
to cost the equivalent of US$150,000 or more, which would cover approximately
50 percent of the credit amount; this is acceptable given the previous pro-
curement performance of the implementing agencies. A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A of the Memorandum of the President,
and amounts and method of procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B.
44.  Procurement of civil works and equipment will be undertaken using
bidding documents acceptable to IDA. Local procurement procedures were agreed
at negotiations.
45.  Consultants will be appointed in accordance with the Guidelines for the
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing
Agency.
Disbursement
46.   Disbursements from the proposed IDA credit would cover:
(a) 90 percent of the expenditure on civil works, including construction
materials and any work done on force account;
(b) 100 percent of the foreign expenditure on directly imported vehicles
and equipment;
(c) 100 percent of the ex-factory price of equipment manufactured within
Bangladesh, or 70 percent of local expenditures for other items
procured locally;
(d) 100 percent of BWDB and ED expenditures on engineering and admin-
istration; the amount of these expenditures is fixed at 10 percent
of BWDB and ED expenditures for civil works contracts, including
construction materials; and
(e) 100 percent of foreign and local expenditures incurred for consul-
tant services.
47.   On the basis of the above, it is expected that the credit would be
employed approximately as follows: BWDB--US$40.7 million; RED--US$27.6 mil-
lion; LGD--US$14.9 million for roads, US$9 million for urban facilities; ED--
US$19.9 million for schools; BIWTA--US$ll million; and BTTB US$10.5 million.
Full documentation would be sent to IDA in support of withdrawal applications
in respect of equipment, consultants and civil works contracts, except for
small civil works contracts of less than US$150,000 equivalent, and for force
account operations which would be reimbursed against statements of expenditure
accompanied by a listing of the contracts of works included in the application
and the total expenditure on each. The actual documentation would be retained
by the implementing agencies and be made available for review by IDA represen-
tatives on request. To ensure the uninterrupted flow of funds for approved
project activities, six Special Accounts, one for each of the executing



-20-
agencies, would be opened in Bangladesh Bank. The authorized combined
allocation for the six Accounts would be US$25 million equivalent.
Accounts and Audit
48.  Each implementing agency would maintain separate records of all expend-
itures incurred. The accounts of all implementing agencies are audited by
their own internal audit systems and by the Comptroller and Auditor General of
Bangladesh (CAG). CAG has a special unit which handles the financial audit of
foreign-financed projects. These audit arrangements would be employed for the
project. Audited project accounts consolidated for each implementing agency
together with auditors' comments would be sent to IDA within nine months of
the close of each fiscal year in which the IDA credit was effective. The
Government is overdue on audits for the first Flood Rehabilitation Project,
and also (as of March 31, 1989) on the Second Flood Rehabilitation Project.
For the first Flood Rehabilitation Project all Statement of Expenses opinions
are up to date and all FY87 audit reports have been received; all FY88 audit
reports became overdue on April 1, 1989, but they are in preparation.
