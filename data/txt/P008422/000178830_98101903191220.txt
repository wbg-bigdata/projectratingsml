INTERUNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED THIRD LOAN TO
NATIONAL INVESTMENT BANK FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT S.A. (NIBID)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE HELLENIC STATE
1.        I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed
loan to the National Investment Bank for Industrial Development S.A. (NIBID),
to be guaranteed by the Hellenic State, for the equivalent of US$25 million
to help finance industrial lending. The loan would have a fixed amortiza-
tion schedule with a term of 12 years including 2 years' grace. The interest
rate would be 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The Bank Group's first operation with NIBID was in 1965 when IFC
invested US$700,000 in its shares. The Bank followed with a US$12.5 million
loan in March 1968, after Greece had substantially completed arrangements
for settling its pre-war foreign debt. A second loan of US$20 million was
made in April 1970. The first loan has now been fully committed, and
US$10.7 million has been disbursed. Of the second loan, US$18.4 million
has been committed and US$11.8 million disbursed.
3.        Since its formation in 1963 NIBID has made much progress in pro-
moting medium and small scale firms throughout Greece. With its operations
steadily expanding, it applied for a third loan from the Bank towards the
end of 1970. Following a reappraisal in March/April 1971, loan negotia-
tions were held in Washington on July 19 and 20, 1971. In these negotia-
tions, NIBID was represented by Mr. George Gondicas, General Manager of
NIBID, and Mr. George Kallimopoulos of NIBID. Mr. Constantine Androutsopoulos
of the ifinistry of Coordination represented the Guarantor.
4.        Apart from the loans to NIBID mentioned above, the Bank has made
two loans to Greece, one for education (US$13.8 million) in November 1970,
the other for groundwater development (US$25.0 million) in June 1971. A
summary statement of Bank loans to Greece is attached as Annex I. Imple-
mentation of the education project (No. 711-GR) is on the whole satisfactory
but appointment of consultants is behind schedule. The deadline for the
effectiveness of the loan for the groundwater development project (No.
754-GR) has been postponed until November 15, 1971 in order to allow the
Government to complete recruitment of experts and ratify the loan documents.
5.        The Bank is presently considering a road maintenance project and
a second education project.
6.        Bank assistance to Greece so far has been in industry, agricul-
ture and education. The industrial sector has to improve its competitive-
ness vis-a-vis the European Economic Community as tariff and other protective



- 2 -
barriers are gradually reduced until full integration is reaclhed in 1984.
Production and marketing skill have to be built up and emphasis placed on
development of viable and internationally competitive finns. In agricul-
ture the Bank is supporting government efforts to increase production
primarily for export and create additional employment. The first education
project financed by the Bank reflected the importance of improving the
technical and managerial efficiency necessary to raise Greece's interlna-
tional competitiveness.
7.        IFC has made investments in five enterprises in Greece, totalling
about US$15 million. Apart from the equity investment in NIBID this in-
cludes a loan of US$600,000 to a fertilizer company in 1962 (sold in 1970);
;equity and loan investments of together US$5 million inl two cement companies
in 1965 and 1966, and of US$8.6 million in an aluminum company in 1970.
No new investments are imminent.
PART II - TIE ECONOMY
8.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Greece" (EMA-36a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 28,
1971. A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex II.
9.        After a slowdown during 1967 and 1968, the Greek economy resumed
its rapid expansion and GDP in constant prices grew by about 8 percent per
annum during 1969 and 1970; a similarly high rate is expected for 1971.
This growth was led by th-e industrial sector where output increased on the
average by 10 percent per annum over the last three years. So far, economic
growth has been achieved without significant pressure on prices.
10.       The sectoral composition of GDP has changed significantly over
the last fifteen years. Agriculture's share declined from 30 percent to
20 percent. However, agriculture still employs about 50 percent of the
country's work force, and accounts for over half the commodity exports. Over
the same period, industrial output grew from 23 percent to 30 percent of
GDP. It also steeply increased its contribution to commodity exports in
recent years; from 1965 to 1970 industrial exports (including processed
metals) increased by more than 45 percent per year on average and now ac-
count for about 40 percent of commodity exports. Services traditionally
contribute substantially to Greece's GDP (shipping) and kept their high
share of more than 40 percent.
11.       The investment rate has risen to 27 percent of GDP in 1970.    The
increasing share devoted to industry and economic infrastructure (power,
transport) favored industrial growth. On the demand side industrial pro-
duction was stimulated by growing domestic consumption and increasing ex-
ports. Greece's industrial policy is based on the recognition that free
trade with the EEC countries will be established for all industrial products
by 1984. Improving the competitiveness of the Greek economy is regarded



- 3 -
as the primary responsibility of private enterprise; however, the Government
encourages industrial investment and exports, and provides infrastructure
and credit. Credit regulations have helped to channel funds into productive
investment.
12.       While export growth has been high (11% per year in the last decade),
the balance of payments is still vulnerable. For years, about one-third of
commodity imports used to be covered by exports while the remainder was made
up Fr invisibles and capital inflow. However, imports have been growing more
rapidly than exports over the past three years, mainly because of increasing
capital goods and raw material imports associated with industrial investment
and production, and the current deficit has increased to US$419 million in
1970, compared with US$359 million in 1969, and US$260 million in 1968. The
growqing deficit has resulted in substantial external borrowing, mainly in
expensive short and medium term loans from American and European commercial
banks, and in a slight decline of foreign exchange reserves in 1970 (to the
equivalent of about two months' imports).   Since 1967, Greece had less access
to official long-term concessionary loans. The EEC did not conclude a new
capital aid agreement after the expiration of the 1962 agreement, while the
European Investment Bank stopped lending in 1967 before the full amount of
the capital aid provided for under the 1962 agreement had been committed.
The liardening of the terms of foreign borrowing during the past three years
led to a deterioration in Greece's foreign debt structure. Taking into
account additional public sector borrowing the debt service ratio will increase
from the present 5 percent to between 11 and 15 percent over the next 5 to
6 years, and a cautious short-term borrowing policy is advisable. Considering,
however, the favorable prospects for further economic growth, Greece continues
to be creditworthy for Bank lending.
13.       Although manufacturing growth has been impressive, many enterprises
arc still a long way from achieving competitiveness with European producers.
In addition to promoting domestic industrial investment, the Government con-
tinues to stimulate change and modernization in this sector by encouraging
foreigni investment in Greece, particularly through joint ventures and by
progressive elimination of quantitative restrictions and tariffs on imports
of manufactures from EEC under its association agreement with the Six.
14.       NIBID has played an important role in financing industrial develop-
ment and in encouraging Greek firms to seek financial and technical links
witlh foreign firms. Its effectiveness in the latter role has been facili-
tated by the strong participation of foreign financial institutions in its
share capital and its Board of Directors.

PART III - THE PROJECT
15.       An appraisal report on the NATIONAL INVESTMNT BANK FOR INDUSTRIAL
DEVELOPMENT S.A. (No. DB-80a) dated Octeober, 1971, is being distributed
separately. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III to this
Report.
Establishment and Resources of NIBID
16.       The National Investment Bank for Industrial Development S.A.
(NIBID) was formed in 1963 by the National Bank of Greece (NBC) the lead-
ing commercial bank in Greece, and a number of foreign banks. NIBID's
share capital of Dr 300 million is fully paid-in of which 55 percent is
held by NBG, 38 percent by thirteen foreign banks, and 7 percent by IFC.
In addition, NIBID obtained long-term funds on a loan basis from NBG (Dr 900
million), from the Bank of Greece -- the Central Bank -- (Dr 900 million)
and from the government (Dr 300 million). The Bank made two loans, one for
US$12.5 million in 1968 and the other for US$20 million in 1970.
Objectives and Role of NIBID
17.       NIBID promotes development of private industry through financing
new productive enterprises and modernization and expansion of existing
enterprises. It encourages cooperation and joint ventures between Greek
and foreign enterprises, and the participation of foreign capital and the
introduction of technical and managerial skills into the economy. In addi-
tion to NIBID the State-owned Hellenic Industrial Development Bank and the
Investment Bank of Greece (owned by the Commercial Bank of Greece) are pro-
viding medium and long-term funds to Greek industry. NIBID's Statement of
Policies and Procedures which was adopted by its Board of Directors in 1965
and amended in April 1970, is reproduced in Annex IV of the appraisal report.
18.       From its creation in 1963 to the end of 1970, NIBID has approved
193 loans and equity investments amounting to Dr 3,170 million (US$ 105.6
million equivalent). Approvals in 1969 accounted for 25 percent of this
total and in 1970 for 37 percent. This strong upward trend continues, and
in 1971 approvals are estimated to reach Dr 1,300 million. Loans are most-
ly under $500,000 equivalent. Some 94 percent of NIBID's operations between
1968 and 1970 were for loans, most of them at the legally permissible maximum
terms of 10 years maturity and an interest rate of 8.5 percent. As an in-
vestment bank, NIBID is entitled to charge, in addition to 8.5 percent interest,
a profit-tied increment up to 1.5 percent, to bring its maximum yield to 10
percent.  Since long-term lending in Greece has become more competitive since
1963W NIlIT1li has been able to clharge an increment only on a small portion of
itA loans, and ini those cases only for 0.5 percent. In addition to straight
loans, NIBID has also made ten debenture loans, five with conversion rights.
Up to now, NIBID has exercised its conversion rights in two cases, and the
shares so acquired amount to Dr 8.6 million.



19.       Since its creation in 1963, NIBID approved 15 equity investments
in 13 companies for a total of Dr 172 million, representing 5.5 percent
of its total approvals. Over half of this amount, Dr 98.5 million, was
approved in 1970, when NIBID, together with IFC, invested in two companies,
Titan Cement and Aluminium de Grece. The largest equity investment in a
single company is Dr 55 million and the smallest Dr 1 million. The rela-
tively low total of equity operations so far is largely explained by the
fact that family companies, which constitute an important share of the
Gripe& industrial sector, hesitate to accept outaide'shareholders.   In turn.
NIB3ID has at times been reluctant to invest in family controlled firms
where minority shareholders run heavy risks.
NIBID's Economic Impact
20.       It is important to understand the environment in which NIBID
operates. Industry in Greece now accounts for nearly a third of GDP but
growth has been based largely on high protection. With the conclusion of
the Treaty of Athens in 1962 involving free trade within the EEC by 1974
for certain industrial products and by 1984 for all industrial products,
Greece had to embark on a new course.
21.       This new course calls not so much for creating new Jobs as for
making industry more efficient and able to face competition at home and
abroad. This is a difficult task, given a shortage of skilled labor and
managerial talent. If productivity cannot be increased, the prospects for
industrial employment are not good.
22.       Increasing industrial productivity is thus a task of great im-
portance and NIBID is concentrating on aiding the expansion and moderniza-
tion of existing Greek enterprises often with the investment of foreign
capital and expertise. Thus, in 1970 NIBID approved loans of $39 million
for projects involving total capital costs of about US$100 million, almost
all of which are based on the need to reduce production costs and sales
prices. The new direct employment created by these projects is estimated
to be about 2,500, equivalent to an investment of US$39,000 per worker.
The incremental annual sales resulting from this investment will be about
$110 million, of which some 15% is expected to be exported.
23.       Fifty-four percent of NIBID's financing has been for projects in
the Athens/Piraeus area (see map Annex IV), where industrial activity is
concentrated. Financial incentives provided by the Government to attract
industries to other areas are beginning to show results. NIBID's three
largest operations (Aluminium de Grece, Goodyear Hellas and Hellenic Owens
Glass) are located outside the Athens area.
24.       The average size of NIBID's financing has remained fairly constant
at about $500,000 equivalent. However, NIBID has been quite active in finan-
cing relatively small firms. Over the last two years, nearly one in three
loans NIBID has made has been for less than $200,000 equivalent.



-6-
Organization and Procedure
25.       Board of Directors.   NIBID's Board of Directors has 20 members,
10 designated by NBG (including the Managing Director) and 10 by the foreign
shareholders. From the beginning, NBG's governor has been chairman of
NIBID's Board.   In January 1971, Mr. Christo Achis became Governor of NBC
and chairman of NIBID's Board. IFC is represented by Mr. Harold Linder.
Full meetings are held twice a year. The Board's responsibilities for
project approvals have been delegated to an Executive Committee of 6
members, 3 representing NBG, one representing IFC and two the other foreign
shareholders.  NIBID's Managing Director attends Executive Committee Meetings
without having a vote. The Executive Committee, in turn, has delegated to
members resident in Greece the authority to approve investments between
Dr 10 million and Dr 20 million. Projects exceeding this limit are circu-
lated to the Executive Committee for approval by mail.    The M1anaging Director
is authorized to approve projects under Dr 10 million.
26.       Management and Staff.   NIBID is well managed. 'Mr. Gondicas, whio
has been managing NIBID since its creation in 1963, has been largely respon-
sible for the steady expansion of the company.   NIBID's staff is experienced
and competent.  Turnover is low, and the staff exhibits a high degree of
dedication to its xork.
27.       Procedures.   While expanding operations, NIBID has maintained
satisfactory appraisal standards.   Projects are carefully reviewed to assure
financial viability. The technical aspect of projects are handled by NIBID's
two engineers, one specialized in civil engineering and the other in ma-
chinery and equipment.   They evaluate capital costs and advise on tile
selection of maclhinery. NIBID promoted the establishment of a consulting
firm in Greece in conjunction with Arthur D. Little Inc. and its services
are used for particularly difficult problems. NIBID has been less effective
in appraising the competitive aspects of projects. It has, however, created
a new industrial data unit to compile and process information relating to
the cost structures of companies and industries financed by NIIID, and there
is reason to believe that this aspect of its appraisal process will improve.
NIBID's project supervision staff has been strengthened in the past year.
Supervision reports have proved valuable for normal follow-up purposes and
also for fresh lending operations with N1IBID's growing number of repeat
clients.
Financial Results
28.       NIBID's earnings before provisions and taxes have increased about
75 percent in the three years from 1968 to 1970; they were equivalent to
14 percent of share capital in 1970. NIBID's net profits (after provisions
calculated to bring cumulative total provisions to 2 percent of tlle year-
end portfolio) were Dr. 21.4 million in 1969 and Dr. 25.9 million in 1970.
Returns on net worth were modest at 6.4 percent in 1969 and 8.6 percent in
1970, reflecting NIBID's limited leverage and narrow interest spread. A
5 percent dividend was paid in 1970, as compared to 4 percent, 3 percent
and 2 percent respectively in the three preceding years.



- 7 -
29.       Total assets have grown rapidly from $28.6 million at the end of
1968 to $68.8 million equivalent at the end of 1970. The loan and equity
portfolio is of good quality, and produced an average yield of 8.25 percent.
Provisions for possible losses are now Dr. 35 million. Principal outstand-
ing on loans experiencing serious difficulties is about Dr. 60 million but
in none of these cases are losses anticipated. NIBID is keeping its problem
projects under close scrutiny. NIBID's equity portfolio, carried at its
original cost of Dr. 167 million at the end of 1970, has an estimated value
of .,bout 160 percent of cost.
Projected Operations and Resource Requirements
30.       Gross manufacturing investment in Greece in 1970 amounted to about
$275 million equivalent. NIBID's disbursements to this sector in 1970 made
up about 10 percent of this total. In a period of expanding industrial
activity such as Greece is enjoying at present, manufacturing investment
should increase at over 10 percent per year for at least the coming two
years. Assuming NIBID can raise the required resources, it should be able
to maintain its share in industrial investment and expand its operation at
the expected growth rate for industrial investment in Greece.
31.       On the basis of its projected operations, NIBID would require
about $100 million equivalent to cover its operations, on an approval basis,
to June 30, 1973. About $7 million of this would be derived from an increase
in share capital, $5 million of which are expected from existing shareholders
and $2 million from the issue of non-voting stock to the public. Another
$10 million would come from domestic bond issues and $5 million from inter-
nal cash genieration. NIBID also hopes to obtain over this period $20 million
from the National Bank of Greece and a like amount from the Bank of Greece.
These resources would narrow NIBID's resource gap to $40 million to be
covered from external sources. NIBID hopes to raise $10-15 million from
European banks. The proposed Bank loan of $25 million would cover the bal-
ance.
32.       By the end of 1971 NIBID's total assets should reach about $100
million equivalent; by the end of 1973, they should total about $180 mil-
lion equivalent, reflecting the rapid growth of NIBID's lending in 1970,
1971 and expectations for the coming two years.
33.       Earnings prospects are reasonably good.    Assuming an 8 percent
yield on NIBID's equity portfolio, net profits (adjusted for excess provisions)
should reach about 12.5 percent of net worth and 15 percent of share capital
in 1973, in spite of the significant increase in share capital planned.
Share Capital Increase
34.       Arrangements have just been completed for an increase of share
capital by 50 percent, through issuing 6 percent non-voting participating
preference shares to present shareholders. IFC will not participate in this
capital increase, as its action is not required for the success of the issue;
existing shareholders will take up the shares which IFC does not subscribe.



- 8 -
In 1972 NIBID plans to offer additional non-voting preference shares to the
oublic and to list these shares for trading on the Stock Exchange. NIBID
also plans in the future to sell in the Greek market bonds with conversion
*-ghts.
Termn of Proposed Bank Loan
35.       As under the previous loan, prior Bank approval would be required
Lor each sub-project requiring a commitment by NIBID in excess of Dr 15
million ($500,000). The aggregate free limit would also be maintained at
2i percent of the loan amount. A change is proposed in the debt level to
which NIBID would be restricted. The debt/equity ratio would be changed
from 5:1 to 7:1, a relaxation related in part to a technical change in tlhe
4efinitions of debt and equity, and in part to a considered evaluation of
the quality of NIBID's performance and portfolio. The Bank of Greece would
-ojntinue to cover the foreign exchange risk for NIBID. During negotiations
?:L was agreed that the loan be repaid according to a fixed amortization
schledule, which would mirror the estimated composite repayment expected from
sub-borrowers. The proposed loan would be limited to financing the foreign
exchange cost of imports needed for investments supported bv NIBID.
36.       NIBID has, with Bank and IFC assistance, become an effective and
important financial institution in Greece, contributing to the growth of
.he Greek economy. It enjoys strong and autonomous management. It has
shown itself capable of using capital effectively. It is creditworthy for
tle additional financing proposed.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
317.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and NIBID, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Helienic State and the Bank, the Report
t)f the Comnittee provided for in A;ticle III, Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for development
finance companies.
38.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Artfcles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECO114ENDATION
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
J oan.
