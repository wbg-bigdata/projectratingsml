1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      The Pension and Social Assistance Project was approved on June 10, 2004. The Credit
Agreement was signed on September 23, 2004 and became effective on January 14, 2005. The
Project was the first social protection project supported by the International Development
Agency (IDA) in Azerbaijan. The Project complemented social protection and labor market
activities under the IDA-financed Institutional Building Technical Assistance I and II Projects
(IBTA) and social protection reforms implemented under the Structural Adjustment Credit
(SAC).

1.1.   Context at Appraisal

2.      Azerbaijan’s social protection system was complex and spread thinly among many

comprising: (i) mandatory social insurance; (ii) categorically targeted, mostly merit based
privileges and subsidies; and (iii) various child allowances financed from the budget. Over the
1990s, severe fiscal constraints eroded the level of benefits to the point that many of them
became insignificant. Insufficient social insurance revenues were supplemented by budget
resources, so that financing of benefits became blurred. In addition, new benefits were added on
an ad hoc basis, some targeting was introduced, and some of the privileges were abolished and
instead a compensatory payment in cash was introduced for certain categories of the population.
As a result, annual expenditure on social protection was thinly spread over too many recipients,
who often found it difficult to understand what type of benefits they were entitled to.

3.      Social Insurance and Social Assistance were managed by separate agencies. All the
social protection benefits had been awarded and records kept by the Ministry of Labor and Social
Protection of the Population (MLSPP), with the State Social Protection Fund (SSPF) collecting
social insurance contributions and acting as a payment agency for all the social transfers. A
presidential decree issued in 2003 separated social insurance and social assistance benefits. The
SSPF was entrusted with the social insurance portfolio and the MLSPP the administration of
targeted social assistance (TSA). However, both agencies had low capacity to administer
benefits. Poor record keeping practices, inadequately trained staff, insufficient number of staff,
and lack of modern equipment all hindered substantially efficient handling of clients in a
transparent manner.

4.      Reforms in the 1990s brought macroeconomic stability, but poverty persisted.
Azerbaijan had initiated implementation of structural and institutional reforms at the beginning
of the 1990s, which resulted in macroeconomic stability and economic growth. However, while
significant advances in structural policies and management of public resources had taken place,
poverty remained a critical development issue in the country. In 2001, despite abundant natural
resource wealth, about 50 percent of the population was considered poor, of which 17 percent
were classified as extremely poor. To promote growth and reduce poverty, in 2003 the
Government of Azerbaijan (GOA) adopted a State Program for Poverty Reduction and Economic
Development (SPPRED). The SPPRED recognized that while diversified economic growth and
reforms to increase employment and raise productivity and incomes remained key to sustainable

                                                1
poverty reduction, an adequate social protection system that provided meaningful protection to
the poor and most vulnerable population was also needed.

5.      The social protection system in Azerbaijan contained numerous barriers to efficiency.
The SPPRED had identified issues hindering the efficient and effective use of resources
allocated to support the most vulnerable populations. In social insurance, these were: (i) low
benefits and low coverage; (ii) complexity of the benefits system; (iii) the benefits system was
not linked to contributions; (iv) weak record keeping capacity by employers, contributors and
beneficiaries; (v) undeveloped and often opaque financial management systems; and (vi)
involvement of enterprises in the benefit administration, which made monitoring benefit award
and payment difficult. In social assistance, these were: (i) poor targeting of benefits; (ii)
fragmentation of benefits; (iii) low benefit levels due to insufficient resources; (iv) weak capacity
to analyze, monitor and evaluate policies; and (v) poor administrative capacity to administer
benefits.

6.       At the time of appraisal, the government envisaged a comprehensive strategy to reform
the social protection system. As per the SPPRED, the government strategy aimed to increase
the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of the social protection programs. In the area of
social insurance, the main government goals were to modernize and strengthen the SSPF in the
areas of financial management and pension administration; move the administration of all the
social insurance benefits from enterprises to the SSPF and link benefits and contributions. In
social assistance, the government aimed to: (i) improve the targeting of the benefits, basing the
eligibility of the applicants on their economic and social situation; (ii) consolidate several
benefits into a single targeted family poverty benefit paid in cash, increasing the budget amount
allocated to this financing; and (iii) modernize the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the
Population (MLSPP) by improving its administrative and policy analysis capacity and improving
its management information system.

7.      The World Bank was well placed to assist with the Government’s reforms. The
Government and IDA had been working together on pension and social assistance reform for a
few years and IDA had supported the preparation and development of the SPPRED. The
Borrower requested IDA’s support to initiate the implementation of this strategy, through the
Project which was to support the objectives of the Borrower’s social protection system reform.

1.2.   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.     The project development objective is to significantly improve the effectiveness and
transparency in the provision of public pensions and social assistance to eligible beneficiaries.

9.      The wording of the PDO was slightly different in the main text of the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD), Annex 3 of the PAD, and in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA). The
differences were, however, in wording and not in substance.

10.     Progress towards achieving the Project’s outcomes was to be determined by the following
four indicators as identified in the PAD:



                                                 2
       •   Evidence of improved financial viability of the social insurance system, as indicated by a
           significant increase in collections under the general public pension scheme;
       •   Evidence of significant increases in the number of contributors to the pension system, as
           evidenced by a compliance rate of 90 percent of working age participants in the general
           public pension scheme;
       •   Evidence that eligible beneficiaries for pensions and social assistance are receiving
           proper payments in a timely manner, as indicated by the absence of arrears; and
       •   Evidence of improved user satisfaction regarding service delivery, as determined by
           means of beneficiary surveys.

1.3.       Revised PDO

11.        The PDOs were not revised during the life of the Project.

1.4.       Main Beneficiaries

12.     The main beneficiaries of changes in the social insurance administration were the two
implementing institutions and the program participants: workers and pensioners. Workers
benefited by a better recognition of the linkage between contributions and benefits and
pensioners benefited through higher pension and regular payment of pensions. The main
beneficiaries of the changes in the social assistance administration were the eligible poor and
vulnerable households, through increased targeting efficiency. The country as a whole benefited
from the improvements achieved at the institutional level by the strengthening of the operational
efficiency of the SSPF and the enhanced capacity for policy formulation by the MLSPP.

1.5.       Original Components

13.     Component 1 - Strengthening the Social Assistance Administration (US$7.35 million
equivalent or 46 percent of total project cost). This component provided capacity to the MLSPP
to effectively deliver targeted social assistance benefits to eligible families, and support to
MLSPP staff to use targeting mechanisms and to undertake knowledge-based policy formulation.
It had the following three sub-components: (i) implementation of a Management Information
System (MIS) to support means and assets testing for eligibility for social welfare programs; (ii)
implementation of targeted social welfare programs; and (iii) enhancing policy analysis capacity
for social protection in the MLSPP. The component financed civil works and the provision of
equipment and materials, technical assistance, and training.

14.    Component 2 - Strengthening the Social Insurance Administration (US$7.58 million
equivalent or 48 percent of total project cost). The component supported the strengthening of the
SSPF to become an efficient and transparent pension administration to manage and administer its
revenues and expenditures efficiently and effectively. Further, it supported knowledge-based
pension policy planning. The component financed two sub-components: (i) implementation of
an MIS to support the establishment of a client data base of individual records (a Central
Register); and (ii) operational improvements in key business processes related to the use of the
Central Register (contributions collections, revenue and expenditure monitoring, audit/inspection,
pension management client services) and institutional strengthening, which included governance

                                                   3
arrangements, general and financial management, human resource management, actuarial
forecasting, policy analysis, and public information. The component financed civil works and
the provision of equipment, materials, training and technical assistance

15.     Component 3 - Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$1.02 million
equivalent or 6 percent of total project cost). This component financed the appropriate
mechanisms for project management and proper tools for project monitoring and evaluation. It
supported the operations of two Project Implementation Units (PIU) – one in the MLSP and one
in the SSPF.

1.6.      Revised Components

16.       The Project’s components were not revised during the life of the Project.

1.7.      Other significant changes

17.      The SSPF used its own resources and those from a UNDP grant to carry out the
rehabilitation of SSPF offices to accommodate the MIS at central and local levels. Thus, the
credit resources allocated initially to civil works under Component 2 were redirected to MIS
activities. The MLSPP was able to make progress in the development and installation of a global
corporate MIS, which had not been envisaged under the Project as such. The Project initially
foresaw only the development and implementation of an MIS for the Targeted Social Assistance
(TSA) program. By Project completion, the MLSPP had acquired a network for all of the
MLSPP offices, covering local and central levels.

18.     The PAD envisaged the refurbishing and upgrading of local MLSPP offices to
accommodate the IT equipment financed by the Project to enable the installation of hardware
and voice and data equipment at the central and local levels. The Credit financed the
rehabilitation of 39 MLSPP local offices by Project completion while the other 45 were
rehabilitated with the Borrower’s own budgetary resources. The reasons for this change were: (i)
the costing done at the time of preparation included only basic cosmetic improvements to the
buildings so the estimates were too low, and (ii) the MLSPP decided to adopt a “one stop?
system, opting for consolidating different offices for different programs, which increased costs.
In addition, new requirements and revision of standards for construction of local offices were
introduced to new works, which further raised the costs; and (iii) the cost estimation was done in
2002/2003 and by the time of implementation the cost of construction materials had increased
considerably.

19.     There were five amendments to the Credit Agreement and two extensions of the closing
dates of the Credit as follows.

       a) The first amendment, letter of February 3, 2006 introduced a new category (5)
          Incremental Operating Costs for Part C.1 of the Project (Social Assistance Administration
          implemented by the MLSPP) with an amount of US$35,000 equivalent deducted from the
          unallocated category. A letter of August 23, 2006 informed the Borrower that the


                                                  4
            amounts of categories (5) and (6) of Schedule 1 of the DCA in the Amendment Letter had
            been erroneously reversed and provided the amended Schedule 1.
    b)      The second amendment, letter of August 9, 2006 provided procurement waiver to
            increase the threshold for procurement of works under National Competitive Bidding
            procedures from US$100,000 to US$1.0 million and under Shopping procedures from
            US$50,000 to US$100,000 per contract (all in US$ dollar equivalent). This was because
            the average value of contracts under NCB was considerably higher than the estimate
            value of US$100,000 made at appraisal.
       c)   The third amendment, letter of September 18, 2006 agreed to decrease the aggregate
            amount of disbursements needed to authorize the deposit into Special Account A in
            Paragraph 1 (c) (i) of Schedule 5 to the DCA from SDR 1,500,000 to SDR 700,000.
    d)      The fourth amendment, took place in 2007 when a new category (6)(a) Incremental
            Operating costs for Part C.1 of the Project (MLSPP PIU) was introduced with an
            allocation of US$55,000 (equivalent).
   e)       The fifth amendment, letter of June 24, 2008 introduced a new category (6)(b)
            Incremental Operating Costs for Part C.2 of the Project (SSPF PIU) with an amount of
            US$9,920 (equivalent).

20.    The closing dates of the IDA Credit were extended twice for a total of 24 months as
follows:

   a) The first extension, letter of September 17, 2008 extended the closing date by twelve
      months from the original closing date of February 28, 2009 to February 28, 2010. The
      extension was required to: (i) complete analysis of the TSA program survey carried out in
      2008, (ii) complete the bidding process for the software for the MIS for the Global
      corporate Network for MLSPP, (iii) procure and install servers, computers, printing and
      filing equipment for SSPF server centers, (iv) procure and install fire protection systems
      for regional SSPF center, and (v) completion of works for the MIS of SSPF.
   b) The second extension, letter of January 15, 2010 extended the closing date by an
      additional twelve months from February 28, 2010 to February 28, 2011. The extension
      was granted to: (i) complete the bidding process for the MIS of MLSPP, including
      development of software for the system, (ii) conclude procurement arrangements for the
      purchase of server equipment for MLSPP, (iii) complete procurement processes for
      servers and licensed software and installation of computer system and completions of
      MIS modules for the SSPF, and (iv) conduct a survey to study the impact of the pension
      reforms supported by the Project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1.        Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

21.    The ICR team rates Design and Quality at Entry as Satisfactory on the basis of the
following features:

22.    Soundness of Background Analysis. The background analysis to prepare the Project
was extensive. IDA supported the GOA in analytical work and preparation of draft legislation

                                                  5
on pension and social assistance reforms. That work served to underpin the Government’s
strategic thinking on social protection. The Project’s main focus on improved administration of
social protection programs, making the pension system more sustainable, and building capacity
to better target social assistance benefits to the most vulnerable groups were based on the GOA’s
recognition of the need to protect poor and vulnerable populations. The GOA’s poverty
reduction strategy (SPPRED) envisaged a comprehensive reform of the social protection system,
involving parametric and administrative pension reform and better targeting of social assistance
expenditures. The Project was a logical continuation of IDA’s support to help clarify the
respective roles for social insurance and social assistance, introduce measures to make the
pension system sustainable and more equitable, and rationalize social programs focusing on
providing more meaningful assistance to the most vulnerable groups.

23.     Assessment of Project Design. Project preparation was supported by technical assistance
financed under a PHRD grant, which supported the GOA in design of specific elements of the
Project. The Poverty Assessment provided important insights to help shape the design of the
Project. The Project design was based on analyses of: (i) lessons learned on experience gained in
related projects in Azerbaijan, namely the IBTA I and II projects and their related social
protection and labor market components; (ii) lessons drawn on IDA experience in helping
develop social insurance and social assistance administration in other parts of the world and the
implementation of social protection actions in the SAC; (iii) analytical work to inform project
design and preparation; (iv) consistency with Government and the World Bank strategies; (v)
complementarities with other IDA-supported projects, including the SAC and IBTA I and II; and
(vi) complementarities with European Union (EU) financed activities to monitor a pilot project
on means-testing. The Project’s objective and scope were appropriate to the stage of
development of the social protection and pension systems and built on experience within
Azerbaijan and elsewhere in the region. The Project was expected to contribute to one of the
four inter-related strategic goals defined by the CAS, i.e. to improve access to services by
reversing the decline in social services and infrastructure. It was also to contribute to achieving
the CAS’ social agenda, which among its priorities included improvement in social protection of
vulnerable groups, including children, pensioners and the unemployed. The extensions of the
closing dates were a result of delays in the implementation of some activities as discussed in
other sections rather than an over-ambitious project design.

24.     Lessons Learned and Incorporated in the Design. As noted earlier, the Project design
addressed several key lessons learned from the implementation of projects in the country and
other lessons learned in developing social insurance and social assistance administrations in
other parts of the world. The following lessons were taken into account when designing the
Project: (i) government ownership and active involvement by ministries and agencies in project
implementation is crucial for project success and sustainability; (ii) for complex programs, such
as public pensions and social assistance, it is important to build a broad consensus for change;
(iii) implementation timetables need to be realistic and flexible to allow for limited agency
experience in project implementation; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is a key project
success. In terms of (i), ownership over the Project was reflected in the commitment of MLSPP
and SSPF in the design and preparation of their respective components. In terms of (ii), an
important element of the Project aimed at creating public awareness of benefits. Timetables (iii)
were reviewed carefully during appraisal, and the pace of implementation was monitored during

                                                6
implementation and adjusted accordingly. The Project design placed great emphasis on
strengthening the MLSPP and SSFP policy and analysis and data gathering capacity to ensure
effective M&E (iv).

25.     Risk Assessment. The PAD included four well-identified risks. While the mitigation
measures were adequately identified and successfully applied during implementation, in the view
of this evaluation, the risk of “limited implementation capacity may lead to delays in project
implementation? could have been rated as High instead of Medium. From the outset it could
have been expected that the design and implementation of information systems with lengthy
procurement processes for hardware and software were likely to take longer than estimated at
appraisal. In practice, lengthy government processes with regard to procurement necessitated
extension of the closing date for a total of 24 months.

2.2.   Implementation

26.     The ICR team rates implementation as Satisfactory. The Project was successful in
delivering the outputs under the three components and achieving its expected outcomes (see
details in Annex 2, Section 3.2, and data sheet). The Project was never considered at risk during
its implementation period. In fact, the ratings for DO and Implementation Progress (IP) of the
Project were consistently Satisfactory with Highly Satisfactory rating for Project Management
during some stages of Project implementation.

27.     The good performance of the Project reflects the strong leadership by both
implementing institutions – MLSPP and SSPF in guiding the Project from its design stage and
effective supervision and guidance by the World Bank team. During the Project implementation
the Minister of MLSPP changed only once and there was no change in the Chairmanship of the
SSPF. In addition, the effective coordination efforts by both PIUs in all aspects of project
administration were crucial to ensuring efficient implementation of activities.

Factors positively affecting implementation

28.    Good macroeconomic environment. Project implementation benefited from a good
economic environment, which resulted in the availability of national resources to meet the
country’s obligations during most of the implementation period. There were no constraints of
counterpart funds. Nevertheless, budgetary pressures appeared during the last two years of
implementation, and the Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) program briefly experienced arrears
in 2009.

29.     Adoption of the Pension Law and other important legislation and regulatory acts. The
approval of the Pension Law at the end of 2005 set the basis for defining and streamlining the
new pension system and establishing a base for utilization of individual records. The adoption of
the Law and its implementation, allowed the SSPF to move briskly with Project implementation.
It also set the ground for information sharing with beneficiaries thereby improving transparency
of SSPF’s operations through an active public information campaign. In addition, a number of
regulatory acts stipulating organization of work of the TSA were developed and adopted by the
MLSPP, including detailed instructions on how to implement the targeting mechanism.

                                               7
30.    Strong Borrower’s commitment. The management of the MLSPP and of the SSPF were
committed to the Project objectives and recognized its importance in supporting a well-
functioning pension system and a social safety net that was able to reach out to the poorest and
most vulnerable families. From the outset, the new Minister of Labor (2005) showed
commitment to address the challenges supported by the Project and his personal involvement
was a critical contributing factor to its successful implementation.

31.     The Project supported strategic changes in the social insurance and social assistance
administrations. In social insurance the changes allowed a better recognition of the linkage
between contributions and benefits, and pensioners through regular payment of pensions. In
social assistance, changes benefitted programs’ participants through increased targeting
efficiency, transparency, and improved service delivery. The trust and ownership that were built
over the years with the partnerships established under the project contributed to important
advances in pension reforms and improvements in the targeting of TSA benefits. The Project
was successful to help transform the SSPF into an E-pension administration. Similarly, the
introduction of an E-social assistance administration supported under the project improved the
capacity of the MLSPP to effectively deliver assistance to eligible families.

32.     Good public information campaign. The SSPF carried out a good information campaign
to provide information to the population on the main changes undergoing in the social insurance
system. This contributed to earn the trust of the population in the reforms being pursued.
Similarly, the MLSPP carried out activities to increase the public’s awareness of the changes
brought to the TSA program. Materials were printed and distributed with methodological
instructions. Information on the TSA program was also aired on national television.

33.     Continuity of teams, both in IDA and at the implementation agencies. IDA had two
Task Team Leaders (TTLs) who guided the design and implementation of the Project. The first
TTL provided implementation support from the early stages of preparation until the end of 2009.
The second TTL had been a member of the World Bank’s supervision team and therefore when
TTL responsibilities were handed over, the transition was smooth. The institutional
arrangements with each implementing agency having its own PIU responsible for project
administration worked well. The director and staff of the PIUs, for the most part, remained in
their position for the duration of the Project. The two PIUs continue to perform the same role
under the second IDA-financed Social Protection Development Project (SPDP) approved in 2008.
The PIUs worked in close collaboration with the technical teams and they were part of the
implementing agencies.

34.     Training of technical personnel was a priority. Training of staff was given utmost
importance both at the SSPF and at the MLSPP. SSPF started the training of its staff in 2005,
right after Project implementation started. The MLSPP proceeded in a similar way. Both
agencies used the Project to strengthen their institutional capacity, upgrade their staff through
training or through new hires of qualified staff. A new IT department was created in 2008
within the MLSPP and its staff trained.




                                               8
Factors and events that influenced negatively implementation

35.    Slow and cumbersome Government procedures that required the review/approval of
Project related documents. Lists of goods and services to be procured, changes to the
Procurement Plan (PP), and disbursements’ documentation needed to go through a cumbersome
administrative process of review and approval within the government, which included the
Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Finance (MOF) and, in some instances, the
Cabinet of Ministers. This caused delay in the formal approval of revised PPs, which meant that
the World Bank and the PIUs worked with a “working version? that was regularly updated by the
Borrower and shared with IDA pending formal approval by the Government. These procedures
delayed implementation of some activities prior to the Mid Term Review (MTR), but were
streamlined shortly after.

2.3.   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

36.    Design, implementation, and utilization of M&E are rated Satisfactory for reasons
elaborated below.

37.    Design. The Results Framework of the PAD (Annex 3) included four PDO indicators
and twelve intermediate results indicators, which reflected well the PDO and Project components.
As per its design, M&E of outcomes/results drew on data generated by qualitative surveys
undertaken by the MLSPP and SSPF on the impact of Project interventions on the beneficiary
population, and the information gathered by local pension and welfare offices.

38.     Implementation. M&E of outcomes and results were managed by the PIUs who worked
in close collaboration with the relevant departments in both implementing agencies. M&E
functions were carried out satisfactorily over the life of the Project with timely availability of
reliable data. The two PIUs were responsible for ensuring effective M&E of the Project’s
outputs and outcomes. The Project supported strengthening the MISs both at the MLSPP and at
the SSPF, which resulted in the availability of better quality data at both institutions. Both PIUs
reported regularly on the progress of each component, including updating the results framework.

39.    In the case of the MLSPP, the better communication infrastructure in headquarters
and in the local offices, as well as the acquisition of software and training meant better
capabilities to monitor the implementation of the TSA program. The Project supported the
development of an M&E function within the MLSPP, which had not been developed before.

40.     In the case of the SSPF, the Project supported the introduction of a computerized
record-keeping and monitoring system. This was key to monitor the improvements of the social
insurance system. The improvements in the information system allowed the PIUs to collect
better information to report on the progress of the Project.

41.     MLSPP carried out an LSMS type survey in 2007/2008 to evaluate performance of the
targeted social assistance programs. The survey was done on a nationally representative sample
of 6,600 households. The findings of the survey indicated that the number of households for
which per capital income was between AZN 55-60 had dropped by 29 percent since TSA’s

                                                9
inception in 2007. It further indicated that targeted social assistance had played a great role in
this respect as persons with an income below AZN 60 only constituted 0.9 percent of the
population. Thus, the survey concluded that extreme poverty had been eliminated in the country
following the implementation of social programs including the TSA.

42.      SSPF carried out a beneficiary survey in mid-2010 which compared favorably with the
results of the beneficiary assessment that had been carried out during Project preparation. The
2010 survey covered the entire country with 2,500 people surveyed representing employers,
employees, self-employed, unemployed, landowners and pensioners. The survey showed that
most of the system participants were satisfied with the changes in social security and pension
system: (i) thirty three percent of respondents mentioned increase of the pension’s amount and its
timely payments as the main achievement of the reform, (ii) fifty two percent linked this to the
payment of pensions by means of ATM cards, and (iii) eleven percent considered that
computerized administration of pension calculation mechanisms contributed to improved
services. Another important conclusion of the survey was that despite the wide range of PR
activities conducted under the Project to raise awareness of the population, there is still a need to
continue public information on the pension and social insurance system reforms.

43.     Utilization. M&E has been used under the Project not only as a management tool to
evaluate the status of compliance with the PDO and implementation of activities, but it has
served to inform policy makers for decision-making purposes. This has been the case for
assessing the evolution of the efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency in the provision of
pensions and social assistance to eligible beneficiaries. M&E has become an important tool
providing the authorities at the central and local levels with timely and relevant data to be able to
fine-tune the programs. For example, on the basis of the results of the 2008 survey, the TSA was
fine-tuned and amendments introduced to the TSA Law that made the application and
administration processes easier for beneficiaries and staff responsible for the administration of
the TSA. The SPDP will further M&E efforts supporting development and introduction of the
M&E function within the MLSPP, including establishment of an M&E Unit, setting up a
reporting system and defining monitoring indicators, activities and procedures as well as the
implementation on a pilot basis of some monitoring activities and training staff.

44.      On the basis of experience with implementation, the intermediate indicators were
clarified during the MTR to add clarity to the language and ensure that results could be measured.
The changes did not require restructuring of the Project as the substance of the indicators was not
altered.

2.4.   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

45.     The environmental impact of the Project was rated C. During preparation, the adequacy
of treatment of potential hazardous materials in office renovation was examined. Provisions were
included in civil works’ contracts with regard to compliance with disposal of materials in an
environmentally safe manner and according to the PIUs, compliance was monitored regularly by
the Engineer/Architect in the PIUs during implementation of the works and found to be
satisfactory.



                                                 10
46.     Procurement is rated Satisfactory. Procurement was rated Satisfactory throughout the
life of the Project. The Procurement Specialists in the PIUs were trained in the World Bank
procurement in workshops and seminars organized by the World Bank. With guidance from the
World Bank’s Procurement Specialist, the two PIUs managed procurement effectively, including
the ICB processes for the procurement of the hardware and software for the MIS, which was
challenging as while the World Bank guidelines were applied, the SSPF tried to comply with
national legislation as well. The Procurement Plan (PP) was updated as required, but as
mentioned in para 35 there were challenges to obtain approval for the revised PP because of the
different layers of Government that needed to approve the changes, including the Cabinet of
Ministers. Procurement under the Project included: (i) civil works, (ii) goods (hardware and
software, office equipment), and (iii) consultant services hired under various types of
procurement methods as per the credit agreement.

47.     Financial Management (FM) is rated Satisfactory. The FM arrangements at the PIUs,
including accounting, reporting, internal controls, flow of funds, and staffing were considered to
be strong throughout implementation and rated consistently Satisfactory. The level and
timeliness of Government co-financing was also satisfactory. In fact, the Government
contributed well above its commitments as it financed all the civil works under Component 2 and
partially under Component 1. There were no major FM issues that arose during implementation.
External audits were prepared and issued in a timely manner and were consistently unqualified.

48.     Disbursements lagged somewhat during the first years of implementation because the
SSPF decided not to use credit resources to finance the rehabilitation of the infrastructure under
component 2. Accordingly, there was a disbursement flag raised in the second half of 2009,
before the closing date for the credit was extended for the first time. As indicated in para 17, the
civil works’ allocation for Component 2 was then reallocated to further improvements in the MIS.
At the end of the grace period (June 30, 2011), disbursements from the credit reached US$10.93 1
million equivalent.

2.5.       Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

49.     Support to social insurance and social assistance programs will continue through the
IDA-financed Social Protection Development Project (SPDP 2) approved in mid-2008. The
implementation of the new project overlapped for about two years with this Project. The PDO of
the SPDP is “to improve delivery of labor market and social protection interventions through
strengthened institutions, enhanced institutional and human resources capacity, and improved
targeting of social safety net programs.? The SPDP has been providing technical and financial
support to the outcomes and results achieved under the PSAP.

50.    The SPDP is helping finance the costs associated with scaling up activities supported
under the Project, while deepening the efforts to strengthen and modernize the institutional
capacity of the MLSPP, including: (i) further improvements in the performance of the TSA and
business processes related to testing eligibility for and awarding the TSA; (ii) staff training
1
   The original SDR amount of SDR 6.8 million was equivalent to US$10 million at the time of Project approval. The availability of more US
dollars reflects the appreciation of SDR currencies against the US dollar. The total credit proceeds at the end of the grace period were US$10.945
million equivalent.
2
  IDA Credit of US$26.7 million equivalent.


                                                                       11
corresponding to these changes; and (iii) two rounds of M&E surveys to assess the TSA
performance and collect information necessary for its continuous improvement. In addition, the
SPDP supports: (i) a comprehensive analysis of the current pension system, including actuarial
analysis of its affordability and fiscal sustainability, and an analysis of individual welfare
consequences for different types of its participants (formal sector employees, farmers,
arrangements for informal sector workers, average, high and low income earners, etc.) and on
developing actuarial analysis in SSPF focusing on strengthening the long-term sustainability of
the pension system, and (ii) the development and implementation of a Living Standards
Measurement Survey (LSMS), which inter alia, will help to monitor and assess the performance
of the TSA program.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1.   Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

51.     Relevance of objectives, design and implementation are rated High. Addressing
effectiveness and transparency in the provision of pensions and social assistance were important
development priorities of both the Government and the World Bank at the time of Project
approval in late 2004. At this writing, the PDO continues to be highly relevant because: (i)
improved delivery of social protection interventions through strengthened institutions continues
to be at the center of the Government’s agenda to improve living conditions of the poor and
vulnerable populations, and (ii) continuing to modernize the social insurance and social
assistance systems continue to be important for the Government to strengthen the long-term
sustainability of the systems. These objectives are also in line with the Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) of December 2006 and its update of April 2008.

52.    The Project components as designed were effective to achieve the PDOs. The activities
included under each component were adequate to achieve the goals and targets as specified in
each component.

3.2.   Achievement of Project Development Objectives

53.     This evaluation rates achievement of PDO as Satisfactory based on the Project
achieving three of its outcome indicators and over-achieving its fourth (See Section F of the data
sheet).    Efforts to transform the SSPF into a modern, efficient, and effective E-pension
administration were successful. Equally, by introducing targeted social assistance and E-social
assistance administration, the capacity of the MLSPP to effectively deliver assistance to eligible
families has increased considerably. The ICR evaluation was based on analyses of outcome
indicators and data linked to the development objectives of the Project, as well as an evaluation
of how project activities were linked to the achievement of the PDO. Achievement of the PDOs
is addressed below:

54.     PDO 1 – improve the effectiveness and transparency in the provision of public pensions
to eligible beneficiaries. The four outcome indicators were achieved: (i) improved financial
viability of the social insurance system, (ii) significant increases in the number of participating
system contributors, (iii) eligible beneficiaries for pensions and social insurance receive proper
payments in a timely manner, and (iv) improved user satisfaction.
                                                12
55.     The Project has been instrumental in supporting improved financial viability of the
social insurance system indicated by a significant increase in collections under the public
pension scheme. Contribution collection increased from 59 percent of total revenues in 2003 to
63 percent in 2010. Consequently, as Table 1 shows, the share of the transfers from the State
budget to the SSPF decreased during the life of the project from 41 percent (of the total funds
available to the SSPF) to 37 percent in 2010.


                      Table 1 - SSPF Revenues 2003-2010 (AZN million)

                        Year          Contributions      Transfers from the
                                                              Budget
                       2003                223                  154
                       2004                279                  137
                       2005                316                  186
                       2006                423                  167
                       2007               799.6                278.7
                       2008               957.9                437.1
                       2009              1034.37              560.00
                       2010              1114.27              646.71
                    Source: SSPF

56.     This achievement reflects an increase in the number of contributors (Table 2) to the SSPF
from 1.30 million in 2003 to 1.87 million in January 2011. The increase was mostly due to the
enrolment of farmers (number tripled) and self-employed workers (increased six fold). However,
as seen in Table 2, the number of contributors in the formal sector also increased considerably.
In 2006 when the system was launched, 90 percent of employees in the formal sector were
captured by the system (1.3 million people). By Project completion, 100 percent were part of the
system. The main increase in contributions was due to capturing persons previously working
informally. Among the factors that contributed to this increase are: (i) the approval of the
legislation on pensions (period 2001-2005), introducing the creation of individual pension
accounts; (ii) annual PR campaigns developed by SSPF, explaining the changes to the pension
system; and (iii) the removal of ceilings to the contributions and offering good conditions for the
forced savings offered through the pension system (SSPF offers an interest equal to inflation,
indexed every year). The Project contributed to the achievement of this outcome by providing
technical support to prepare pension legislation, contributing to overcome resistance within the
government to changes in the pension system; and by providing the necessary infrastructure to
develop and implement the MIS which helped minimize fraud, improved collections, and
increased flexibility and transparency of the pension system.

57.    The Government has paid particular attention to increasing pensions and social
assistance and paying them on time. Between January 2005 and January 2008, the minimum
pension paid to all beneficiaries increased almost 2.5 times (from AZN 25 to AZN 60). By
Project completion, all beneficiaries were receiving their pensions in time and without arrears.
This was achieved by the establishment under the Project of the Central Registry, which allows
an updated record of participants and flow of funds, and by the automation of the payment
process. Pensioners are paid by ATM/VISA through debit cards. This has allowed greater
transparency and accountability in the delivery of the social transfers, eliminating delays and
corruption.

58.     Institutional and policy changes supported by the Project have resulted in much
needed streamlining of the pension system and benefits. The Project has led to important
achievements in: (i) the implementation of a parametric reform of the pension (PAYGO) system,
which albeit limited in its scope, included the introduction of stronger links between
contributions and benefits through a notional defined contribution pension component; (ii) the
radical transformation of the social insurance administration. The SSPF uses a fully automated,
individualized record keeping and benefit administration and management system, which have
strengthened administrative discipline; (iii) streamlining of the pension system and benefits with
improved service delivery mechanisms, better planning and management, good governance, and
transparent administration. As noted in para 50, the SPDP will further support these efforts
through, inter alia, a comprehensive analysis of the current pension system, including actuarial
analysis of its affordability and fiscal sustainability, and an analysis of individual welfare
consequences for different types of its participants.

59.     PDO 2 – improve the effectiveness and transparency in the provision of social assistance
to eligible beneficiaries. The two related outcome indicators were achieved: (i) eligible
beneficiaries for social insurance receive proper payments in a timely manner, and (ii) improved
user satisfaction.

60.     Institutional and policy changes supported by the Project have resulted in improved
administration of social assistance benefits. The Project has led to important achievements in:
(i) streamlining cash transfer programs; (ii) improving their fiscal sustainability; (iii)
strengthening their poverty focus, and (iv) improving transparency and efficiency of the TSA
administration. With support from the Project, the MLSPP has a fully automated TSA

    Total number of contributors in 2003 was 1.3 million. This number needs to be verified.


                                                                        14
Administration with real time connection covering the entire country. The majority of TSA
beneficiaries receive their monthly benefits using ATMs.

61.    With support from the Project, the TSA has performed well in reaching the very poor
and poor. Forty nine percent of its beneficiaries receiving 51 percent of TSA resources are from
the bottom decile of the population. TSA distribution is strongly pro-poor and 86 percent of
TSA resources accrue to the bottom 20 percent of the population. The TSA has a well-
functioning administration with fully automated business processes covering the entire country.
Table 3 shows the increases of annual average TSA payments.

62.     By Project completion, all beneficiaries were receiving their social assistance benefits
in a timely manner and without arrears. This was achieved by the establishment under the
Project of the Central Registry, which allows an updated record of participants and flow of funds,
and by the automation of the payment process. TSA beneficiaries are paid by ATM/VISA
through debit cards. This has allowed greater transparency and accountability in the delivery of
the social transfers, eliminating delays and corruption.

63.    Finally, as described in paras 41-42, improved user satisfaction regarding service delivery
has been determined by means of beneficiary surveys. The Project succeeded in achieving this
outcome, as shown by the surveys carried out by SSPF and MLSPP.




                                               15
3.3.   Efficiency

64.     Efficiency is rated Substantial. An economic and financial analysis was not carried out
at the time of the ICR. The PAD established that the economic benefits of the Project would
derive from the introduction of cost-effective processes for the management and administration
of the social assistance and social insurance systems.

65.     In the case of the pension system, the Project supported the introduction of elements for a
better administration (based on individual accounts, better collection of information, better
reporting) of the pension system, centralized in a single agency (SSPF). In the case of social
assistance, the improvements in administration and management of the program have allowed
better targeting of the resources and a reduction in the margin of error in the allocations. The
Project has decreased the leakage of funds to people who were not supposed to receive social
assistance. The Project has contributed to a stronger capacity to carry out policy analysis. The
MLSPP has improved its capacity to monitor the programs and to evaluate their effectiveness.

66.     The Project has had significant positive impact on financial viability of the social
insurance system and targeting accuracy of the social assistance in the country. In particular,
the Project has made significant achievements in: (i) improving the financial viability of the
social insurance system -- pension contribution collection increased from 59% in 2003 to 63% in
2010; (ii) increasing the number of participating system contributors from 1.3 million in 2003 to
1.9 million (43% of the active labor force of 4.33 million) in January 2011; (iii) developing and
operating a comprehensive computerized record-keeping of participants of the social insurance
system – by the end of 2010, personal records for almost 1.9 million contributors and over 1.3
million pensioners were recorded in the data bases of the SSPF; (iv) reducing the targeting error
below the target at appraisal (the target was 40% compared to 30.6 percent actual); (v) more
accurately calculating social benefits through the use of MIS to test eligibility and monitor
targeting efficiency – all central, regional, and local offices have access to the MIS and staff have
been trained in its use; and (v) the establishment of a Central Register, which provides
comprehensive computerized record-keeping of participants and flow of funds of the pension
system. Also, MLSSP financial management and record keeping functions are installed and
successfully being used by the Financial Department and TSA responsible department; (vi)
strengthening of internal administrative processes both in MLSPP and SSPF.

67.    As shown in Table 1, the contribution from the state budget has been gradually
decreasing, though the issue of the pensioners working in enterprises from the Soviet era is
conditioning the speed at which this reduction of contributions can be achieved.

3.4.   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

68.     The Project’s overall outcome is considered Satisfactory based on the Project’s
significant achievements, its continued relevance, its contribution towards strengthening the
country’s social insurance and social assistance programs, and making them more
accountable and efficient. As Azerbaijan continues its further development of the pension and

                                                 16
social assistance systems, the Project’s contributions will continue to be highly relevant. As
stated in para 50, the Project’s contributions are being further supported under the ongoing SPDP,
which project’s performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory at this writing.

3.5.    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

69.    Social protection programs in Azerbaijan are playing a key role in poverty reduction.
According to a 2008 survey by the State Statistics Committee, the number of households with
per capita income between AZN 55 and AZN 60 had dropped by 29 percent during the period
2005-2008. The TSA has played a great role in this respect. By 2008, persons with income
below AZN 60 comprised only 0.9 percent of the population. These findings mean that extreme
poverty has been eliminated in the country following the implementation of social programs
including the TSA. With support from the Project, the TSA has performed well in reaching the
very poor and poor as 49 percent of its beneficiaries receiving 51 percent of TSA resources are
from the bottom population decile and 86 percent of TSA resources accrued to the bottom 20
percent of the population in 2010.

70.     The surveys carried out during the implementation of the Project showed that: (i) the
social transfers (pensions and targeted social assistance) - supported by the Project - have
contributed to mitigating poverty in the country. A comprehensive LSMS fielded in 2008
showed that: (i) without social transfers, the overall poverty incidence would increase by more
than 11 percentage points: from 10.8 to 21.0 percent (an increase of over 100 percent); (ii) the
poverty gap would more than double - from 2.4 to 7.2 percent - and the severity of poverty
would more than quintuple, from 0.7 to 3.8. The poverty reduction impact of social transfers
indicated: (i) that inequality would be higher in the absence of social transfers; (ii) the good
poverty reduction performance indicates that the country is making an effective use of the
resources it spends on social transfers; and (iii) pensions have delivered most of the poverty
reduction performance of social transfers, since it is the largest program (around 85 percent of all
spending on social transfers). TSA contributes to poverty reduction as well, but because of the
small size of the program (0.36 percent of GDP in 2008 - only 7.5 percent of total spending on
social transfers - covering only 12.4 percent of the poor), the impact is much smaller. However,
relative to its budget, TSA performs better than pensions in poverty reduction. For each point of
GDP spent on TSA, poverty incidence declines by 2.8 points compared to 2.0 points for pensions.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

71.    As discussed earlier, Project investments have resulted in substantial institutional
development impacts at the central, regional and local levels of MLSPP and SSFP. The Project
succeeded in helping the MLSPP and the SSPF to effectively deliver targeted social assistance
and pensions and enhance the capacities of both institutions to formulate policies.

72.    Each of the three components supported institutional strengthening in their respective
areas.



                                                17
73.     Component 1 - Strengthen the Social Assistance Administration supported: (i)
development and installation of an MIS to conduct means and asset testing for eligibility for
social welfare programs, (ii) training of central and local staff in the use of the MIS system and
other IT applications, (iii) development and implementation of a centralized database of
applicants and recipients of TSA, (iv) training of staff for nation-wide implementation of the
TSA, (v) development of a M&E function in the MLSPP for targeted benefit programs, and (vi)
enhancing the policy analysis capacity in the MLSPP.

74.    Component 2 – Strengthen Social Insurance Administration financed technical assistance
and training for: (i) development and installation of an MIS of hardware, voice and data
communications related to the MIS in Baku and the regional and local offices of the SSPF, (ii)
development and implementation of functional software applications, (iii) training of the
majority of staff (900) in the SSPF in the use of the MIS at central and local level and essential
computer skills, (iv) training of IT specialists from the IT department and PIU on Oracle and HP-
UX, IT standards, COBIT and ITIL, and VM-Ware, and (v) study tours to the Netherlands,
Poland and Finland to learn the experiences in these countries regarding automation of business
processes.

75.    Component 3 – Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation supported: (i) training
on international procurement, (ii) project management, (iii) financial management, and (iv) IT,
including applications noted under Component 2 above.

(c)   Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

76.    None.

(d)   Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

77.     Both the SSPF and the MLSPP carried out beneficiary surveys throughout the life of the
Project. The SSPF carried out a first beneficiary survey in 2008 and a second one in 2010. The
results of the 2008 survey are presented in para 42. The MLSPP carried out an LSMS in 2008,
the results of which have been incorporated in para 70. The TSA program was the subject of
several surveys carried out by the MLSPP in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The main results of the
surveys showed that while the implementation of the TSA program was satisfactory, the program
will continue to need fine-tuning. Further evaluation of the program performance is to come in
2011 from the more recent LSMS.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low

78.     The risk at the time of the ICR that development outcomes (or expected outcomes) will
not be maintained is rated Low. The GOA’s ownership and commitment to sustaining gains are
strong as demonstrated, inter alia by: (i) motivation to deepen the achievements reached with
support from the Project through the SPDP; (ii) the change of culture gradually achieved among
the staff of SSPF and the MLSPP; and (iii) motivation to make progress in actuarial analysis in
the case of the pension system due to GOA’s concerns about its long-term fiscal sustainability;

                                               18
(iv) good track record of reforming its social protection system and policies to improve
governance and service delivery mechanisms; and (vi) continuing to put emphasis on training of
staff to strengthen the human resources capacity.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1.    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

79.     The ICR team rates the World Bank performance in ensuring Quality at Entry as
Satisfactory. The Project design was relevant to the objectives of the CAS and the
Government’s strategy as discussed in Section 1.1. The Project design was sound and activities
were linked to objectives that the project intended to achieve. IDA had been involved in social
protection issues in Azerbaijan since the 1990s, providing analytical, advisory, and strategy and
reform development services. The Government and IDA had been working together on pension
and social assistance reform for a few years and IDA had supported the preparation and
development of the SPPRED. The Borrower requested IDA’s support to initiate the
implementation of this strategy, through the Project which was to support the objectives of the
Borrower’s social protection system reform.

80.     The World Bank’s team collaborated closely with the government to guide the design and
preparation of the Project. It played an important catalyst role in building consensus and support
for social protection reforms because of its cross-country experience and cutting-edge knowledge
of policy design, targeting methods, administration of social insurance and social assistance
programs. The IDA team’s technical assistance was highly valued by the Borrower in
overcoming the resistance and reluctance prevailing within institutions involved in social
insurance and social assistance.

(b)    Quality of Supervision

81.     The quality of Supervision is rated Satisfactory. The IDA team carried out regular
supervision missions throughout the life of the Project. Project implementation was monitored
regularly by the World Bank team during and between missions. The team was proactive in its
communication with Government and particularly the two implementing agencies to help
identify bottlenecks and mutually tried to resolve them. While the project implementation still
faced delays that led to two extensions, the work of the team was seen by the Government as
helpful in acceleration of implementation and final achievement of the PDO. The skills mix was
appropriate and comprised HQ-based and Azerbaijan-based staff. There was continuity of task
team leaders. As noted earlier, the first TTL guided the project through its design and
preparation stage and remained as TTL for the first three years of implementation. The second
TTL had been in the team for some time and therefore the transition was smooth. The continuity
of TTLs played an important role in ensuring strong communication with the authorities. In
addition, the World Bank team provided good support to the Borrower on fiduciary matters.
Procurement guidance was particularly helpful to the counterparts especially during the
procurement of hardware and software for the MIS. Other important elements of supervision
included:
                                               19
      •    The team promoted a culture of regular contact with counterparts to help resolve issues
           and/or address client requests and needs during and between missions;
      •    The team showed flexibility in making amendments to the Credit Agreement due to
           evolving needs;
      •    Financial Management and procurement guidance was systematic and timely;
      •    Field visits to regional and local offices were particularly appreciated by counterparts as
           they provided an opportunity to share knowledge and experience.

(c)       Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

82.        Overall Bank performance is rated Satisfactory for the following reasons:

      •    Good dialogue with the Borrower during design and preparation and in ensuring quality
           at entry;
      •    Sound supervision throughout implementation; and
      •    Responsiveness to the client needs.

5.2.       Borrower Performance

(a)       Government Performance

83.     The Government’s performance during Project preparation and implementation is
rated Satisfactory. The Government showed a strong commitment to the Project during its
design and implementation stages. It adequately combined the support provided by IDA to
prepare the Project with the support provided by UNDP, to bridge the time gap until the IDA
project was approved and implementation started. Prior to Project approval, GOA had: (i)
developed key strategic documents such as the SPPRED, which envisaged a comprehensive
reform of the social protection system, (ii) issued a Presidential Decree (2001), separating social
insurance and social assistance benefits administration, (iii) adopted in 2001 a Pension Concept
to modernize the social insurance system pursuing principles of a market economy, and (iv)
developed a means testing targeting mechanism on the basis of a pilot program implemented in
2003 with support from TACIS. The TSA program was introduced nationally in July 2006
replacing several child and family benefits, thus decreasing the fragmentation of assistance. The
launching of the program was preceded by the adoption of several key pieces of legislation and a
number of regulatory acts stipulating organization of work pertaining to the TSA and describing
business processes. Government provided adequate counterpart funds to fulfill its obligations
and enable Project implementation. In fact, the GOA provided more funds than projected at
appraisal as it financed all the civil works for local offices of the SSPF. About US$600,000
originally allocated from the proceeds of the Credit for civil works for the SSPF were reallocated
to cover increased needs for the MIS.




                                                   20
(b)   Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

84.    The performance of the two implementing agencies – MLSPP and SSPF – during
implementation is rated Satisfactory. From the outset, there was strong ownership of the Project
by the Director of the SSPF and the Minister and management of MLSPP. This commitment
continued throughout the life of the Project. Within both institutions, there was strong support
by the leadership for the reforms in the administration of the social pension and assistance
systems. MLSPP and SSPF management were effective in helping resolve complex issues that
arose during implementation. The heads of both agencies were systematically involved in the
progress of the Project. This allowed the PIUs to have the support required to make timely
decisions and to overcome bottlenecks that arose during implementation.

85.     The overall performance of the Project reflects the strong coordination by the two PIUs.
Each PIU was responsible for day to day administration of their respective component. Both
PIUs coordinated well among agencies, central, regional, and local offices to ensure timely
implementation of activities. They also liaised well with the World Bank bringing to the
attention of the World Bank team issues that arose that needed the World Bank’s involvement.
Overall coordination, as well as procurement, financial management, and M&E worked well.
Both PIUs were successful in building and maintaining productive relationships with all agencies
involved in project implementation.

(c)   Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

86.     The overall Borrower rating is Satisfactory. The main reasons include: (i) strong
ownership of the Project during the preparation stage and enhanced during implementation; (ii)
timely allocation of counterpart funding well beyond that agreed at appraisal; (iii) effective
administration and coordination of Project activities; and (iv) willingness to fine-tune programs
on the basis of surveys conducted throughout implementation.

6. Lessons Learned

87.    Lessons learned can be categorized into the following major headings:

(a)   Government ownership and capacity development

88.     Strong government commitment is critical, particularly with reform-oriented projects.
Reform is concerned not only with technical and institutional improvements, but relies heavily
on the political process. Leadership and ownership of the reforms pursued by the Project were
crucial to its success. In the case of the Project, there was strong commitment not only from the
Minister of the MLSPP and the Chairman of the State Social Protection Fund, but also from the
Ministries of Finance and Economy to bring about reform which were crucial in the adoption of
legislation and amendments to pertinent laws and regulatory acts.

89.     Importance of focusing on good governance when carrying out reforms. From the
outset, it was acknowledged by the Government that an adequate social protection system would
require increased efficiency of social assistance provision through improved accountability and
business practices. The Project’s focus to make the pension system more sustainable and to

                                               21
build capacity for improved targeting of social assistance to benefit the most vulnerable,
contributed to these efforts. Its emphasis on improving governance was critical in achieving
increased efficiency in the use of resources, as well as on eliminating arbitrary practices,
corruption, and lack of trust in the pension system.

90.    The probability of success in any reform is higher where there is a reform champion,
but broader support is needed for sustainability. To institutionalize new systems, processes
and practices ensuring sustainability of ownership by the implementing agencies is also essential.

(b)   Implementation Guidance by the World Bank

91.      Providing continuous guidance and actively engaging with counterparts in seeking
solutions to challenges as they arose was critical in the successful implementation of the Project.
A focus on identifying problems and seeking solutions as a coherent, collaborative World Bank-
client team was important for achieving results.

92.    Technical and timely support for fiduciary tasks provided by the World Bank was
highly valued. With limited experience in implementation of the World Bank’s procurement
guidelines and financial management requirements, it was important for the World Bank to
provide on-the-job training and to make available training courses/workshops to build the
capacity of the PIUs in procurement and financial management.

(c)   Other

93.     Long-term engagement. Reforms in the social sectors are complex and require long-
term engagement. The GOA sees the World Bank as a strong partner to continue to support
further improvements in social protection interventions. The SPDP is ensuring the long-term
support that is needed to sustain and expand the reforms. This said, experience demonstrates that
implementation of most projects take more than four years, especially those involving complex
reforms. Therefore, more realistic expectations should be set for implementation periods. Two
extensions of the closing date were required in the case of the Project.

94.    Good PR campaigns on ongoing reforms earned civil society trust in the reform. In the
case of the Project, the government reached out to the population to gather information on the
performance of the system and used it to improve their performance. It made a consistent effort
to implement information campaigns to convey to the general public the content of the reforms
under implementation, build trust in the public sector and enhance accountability.

95.     Developing adequate monitoring systems is crucial for the sustainability of the programs.
The Project supported the development of databases and the MIS for both institutions as basic
tools to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the social protection programs. The leadership
of both institutions was committed to continue deepening the efforts to develop their monitoring
and evaluation systems to sustain the system and programs in the long term. The ongoing SPDP
is further supporting these efforts.

  Although the percentage of expenditures for the component is essentially the same as projected at appraisal, the percentage of expenditures for
civil works under the IDA Credit were considerably less as the MLSPP used own funds and that from a UDNP grant to finance a large percentage
of civil works (see para 18). IDA funds for civil works under the component were reallocated towards purchase of more equipment than
projected at appraisal.
6
  Please refer to para 83 for the increase in expenditures under this component which reflect the much higher expenditures for civil works
(US$13.58 million equivalent) for SSPF offices totally funded from Government contribution.

   Government financed a great deal of training from own funds and these expenditures are not capture in this annex as training was conducted in
the context of overall institutional strengthening of the two institutions, which went beyond the Project.
12
   The SSPF financed a good portion of incremental operating costs incurred by the Project. These are not captured by this Annex as the Fund
saw the PIU and its expenditures as an integral part of its functions.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Components                                     Outputs
Component 1 - Strengthening the Social Assistance Administration
             The component succeeded in helping the MLSPP to effectively deliver targeted
             social assistance programs and enhance its capacity to develop social welfare
             policy. In order to achieve this objective, the Project implemented the following
             activities under three sub-components.

               1.a Development of a Management Information System
                   • 2005-2008: Civil works to refurbish and upgrade MLSPP offices to
                      accommodate the computer equipment provided under the Project and to
                      install MIS-related hardware and voice and data communication at
                      central and regional level.

               Initially, 10 regional centers of MLSPP (Dashkasan, Gadabay, Oguz, Balakan,
               Gabala, Gakh, Agstafa, Gazakh, Tovuz and Hajigabul), the main administrative
               building of MSLPP of Nakchivan AR and four regions (Julfa, Shahbuz, Sadarak
               and Kangarli) were renovated.

               In a second phase, 13 central and regional offices of MLSPP (Baku, Sumgayit,
               Sabunchu, Nizami, Khatai, Nasimi, Lerik, Lenkaran, Bilesuvar, Neftchala,
               Kurdemir, Agdash və Shamakhi) were renovated.

               39 city and regional Centers of Social Protection of the Population (CSPPs)
               offices refurbished.

                   •   Provision of furniture for the offices
                   •   Provision of server hardware equipment and software for corporate
                       software applications.
                   •   Creation of an IT expert group to maintain and develop the MIS system.
                       Staff were trained in multiple IT areas.
                   •   Development and implementation of a centralized database of applicants
                       and recipients of TSA.
                   •   Development and implementation of a corporate MIS for the MLSPP:
                       connection of 78 regional offices including CSPPs to the central offices
                       through fiber optic lines.
                   •   Information Portal and Financial management software application in its
                       initial stages of implementation by Project completion.
                   •   Electronic Document Flow: procurement of software, transfer of TSA
                       database; linkage of all divisions of MLSPP in an intranet network;
                       installation of a document flow software system.

               1.b Implementation of TSA
                   • Approval of key legislation by Parliament (Law on Targeted Social
                     Assistance);

                                              26
                  •  Development and approval of norms related to organization of the TSA
                     program, business processes and practices, including implementation of
                     targeting mechanism;
                 • Development of a means testing targeting mechanism;
                 • Hiring of 450 administrators, on a competitive basis;
                 • Training of all 655 employees of TSA on the MIS and benefit
                     administration;
                 • Information campaign to the public on TSA program, detailed on
                     procedures, application process, etc
                 • Procurement of 32 vehicles or the regional offices;
                 • Establishment of a help line at the MILSPP to address questions by the
                     population
                 • Survey to monitor and evaluate the program carried out in 2006, 2007
                     and 2008. Results used to fine tune the TSA program.
Component 2 - Improving the Social Insurance Administration
             The component succeeded in supporting the SSPF to become an efficient and
             transparent pension administration to administer its revenues and expenditures
             efficiently and effectively. In order to achieve this objective, the Project
             implemented the following activities under two sub-components.

I.     MAIN ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PSAP

Component 1: Str engthening the Social Assistance Administr ation

1.      The implementation of specific reforms in the social protection system to ensure efficient
protection of vulnerable people was one of six major strategic goals set by the Government to
reduce poverty in the context of “The State Program on Poverty Reduction and Economic
Development in the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2003-2005,? approved by the Decree of the
President of Azerbaijan Republic. The previous social assistance system included only benefits
and compensations defined by categories. A mechanism of targeting benefits directly to the poor
was unavailable which lead to social injustice.

2.      The Law on “Targeted Social Assistance? was adopted on October 21, 2005 along with
other relevant legal acts enabling the implementation of the Law to take social assistance
programs towards best global practice and to ensure the efficiency of the system to provide
targeted social assistance (TSA) for needy families living in poverty. The TSA was launched all
over the country in July 2006. The TSA is a monetary assistance provided by the state to low-
income families, whose monthly average income is lower than the total needs per each member.
The TSA aims to ensure social protection of low-income families where key principles are
targeting, integrity and equality. The following activities were carried out under each sub-
component:

Sub-Component 1: Implementation of MIS

3.      An automated management information system (MIS) to support means and asset testing
for eligibility for social assistance was developed and implemented. A centralized data base of
all applicants and recipients of the TSA was developed. The data base comprises comprehensive
information on the socio-economic situation of the applicant and beneficiary households and
enables real time updates on the number and various characteristics of the recipient households
and resources needed for the financing of the program. It provides an excellent monitoring and
planning tool to the Department of Targeted Social Assistance of the MLSPP. At any point in
time, the Ministry has up-to-date comprehensive information on the TSA recipients, applicants
and resources spent on the program (as soon as any information is entered into the MIS system at
the local offices across Azerbaijan, it is automatically visible at the central level).

4.     The development of the MLSPP Corporate MIS. The corporate MIS will automate all of
the MLSPP business processes, as well as those of its subsidiary agencies (for instance, the
National Employment Service, etc.) and link/integrate them for efficient and effective program
management and monitoring.


                                               34
5.      Within the framework of PSAP it was envisaged during the first phase to use an
application of modern Information and Communication Technologies for 2008-2013 years. This
mainly included connection of the Ministry’s structural units to integrated network and
development of specialized software for operation of MLSPP in on-line mode. The MLSPP, with
support from international IT consultants, carried out IT Audit to do the analysis of current ICT
system (within PHRD Grant TF090314 aimed at preparation of SPDP). Based on this audit, the
global design of the corporate MIS and a strategy to implement it was prepared. Under the
Targeted Social Assistance Program a new targeted social assistance software application was
developed which contributed to the full automation of targeted social assistance management.
All local Centers of Social Protection of Population were provided with information and
communication technologies and connection to the MLSPP central office is available through
fiber-optic lines and on a real time basis with most of them (78 regions). The designed TSA
software application helped develop central database, enhance the efficiency of social assistance
programs though modern technologies and thus improve the overall social protection system.

6.      Within the PSAP framework, the Ministry has started to proceed with the implementation
of “One stop shop? practice which leads to delivery of the integrated social assistance through
placement of all MLSPP entities, such as CSPP, GED, SLI on one office building and connection
to the Ministry’s Corporate Network. Having such practice, people may apply to MLSPP branch
office to get appropriate social services (for instance TSA and other social benefits, disability
certification etc.).

7.     The procurement of the Server Hardware and Software for Corporate Software
Applications was carried out to ensure uninterrupted functioning of the tailored software to be
applied in the Ministry. Technical specifications for servers were developed by Ministry’s IT
group together with consultants responsible for the implementation of all three systems as well as
with the International MIS Consultant. Based on these specifications the MLSPP conducted
procurement of servers and installation of corporate software applications in the ministry.

8.     Maintaining and developing the MIS system: An IT Expert group was developed and has
functioned well. This is critical as the new MIS demands adequate administrators support and
maintenance. To cope up with future developments and future application of global corporate
software at the ministry, it is essential to develop the capacity of the IT Expert Group of the
ministry. With this purpose special courses have been attended by IT specialists, including
network security, network solutions, MS SQL, CISCO etc.

9.      Refurbishment of MLSPP facilities: Civil works activity started in 2005 and was
successfully completed by the end of 2008. Early in implementation, it was noticed that it was
not possible to carry out the renovation of all regional offices: the real costs and budget
estimation had not taken into account up-to-date technical standards. Besides, there had been a
considerable price increase in the previous two years. Thus it was decided to redesign and re-
evaluate the MLSPP offices under the process of renovation and to be renovated. Initially 10
regional centers of MLSPP (Dashkasan, Gadabay, Oguz, Balakan, Gabala, Gakh, Agstafa,
Gazakh, Tovuz and Hajigabul), the main administrative building of MSLPP of Nakchivan AR,
and four regions (Julfa, Shahbuz, Sadarak and Kangarli) were supported with renovation works
to international standards. Later on, renovation works continued in 13 central and regional

                                               35
offices of MLSPP (Baku, Sumgayit, Sabunchu, Nizami, Khatai, Nasimi, Lerik, Lenkaran,
Bilesuvar, Neftchala, Kurdemir, Agdash və Shamakhi). Thus, 39 city and regional CSPPs
offices were totally refurbished. Office furniture was purchased to ensure comfortable activity of
MLSPP city and regional offices.

Sub-Component 2: Implementation of Targeted Social Assistance

10.    The TSA program was introduced nationally in July 2006. This benefit replaced several
child and family benefits, thus decreasing the fragmentation of assistance. The launching of the
program was preceded by a range of legal and institutional development activities, including the
following:

   •    Several key pieces of legislation were drafted and adopted by Parliament;
   •    A number of regulatory acts stipulating organization of work pertaining to TSA and
        describing business processes was developed and adopted by the Government and the
        MLSPP, including a step by step instructions on how to implement the targeting
        mechanism;
   •    the means testing targeting mechanism was finalized (based on the pilot program
        implemented in 2003; supported by TACIS);
   •    450 benefit administrators were hired on a competitive basis;
   •    All staff involved in the TSA implementation (655 employees) was trained in the benefit
        administration and in using the MIS system. Additional training was organized for the
        heads (managers) of the MLSPP local offices in early of 2009;
   •    Comprehensive public information campaign informing the public about the targeted
        social assistance, application procedures and eligibility requirements was designed and
        implemented nationwide. In many instances, local governments’ officials and heads of
        the local TSA departments used local media (TV stations, radio stations, newspapers) to
        explain eligibility testing procedures.
   •    Regional offices are equipped with 32 4WDvehicles. PIU/PSAP carried out tender
        procedures under ICB method for procurement of vehicles for regional offices aimed to
        provide timely implementation of the monitoring activities and to foster realization of
        important measures connected with Targeted Social Assistance Program and has
        successfully procured 32 vehicles for its offices.
   •    A help line (“Hope?; dial 142) was established at the Ministry to provide Q&A related
        to the TSA.

11.     Between 2006 and 2009 the law on “Targeted Social Assistance? and regulations
experienced amendments to improve the TSA and increase the scope of beneficiaries. The
current number of social assistance beneficiaries makes 9.3 percent of overall households in the
country (173,206 families with 791,029 members). Each family receives AZN 99.37 on average
per month and AZN 21.76 each family member. At the same time 12,840 (1.6%) persons are
paid AZN 20 additionally for having children under 1 year old. 91.3 percent of families are paid
benefits via plastic cards in ATMs. 70,969 beneficiary families or 41 percent have 3 or more
children and 23,310 or 13.5 percent have a disabled family member. Children make 47.9 percent
of family members and 90 percent of families have children. 77.6 percent of beneficiary families
are new clients which can be regarded as to demonstrate the targeted nature of the assistance.

                                               36
With purpose to set up a monitoring and evaluation system of its programs, aimed to help the
MLSSP in evaluation of TSA program effectiveness, the survey of 6,660 households has been
conducted during 2007 and beginning of 2008.

12.     Activities under this sub-component were successfully completed in 2009. All MLSPP
regional offices maintain fully computerized comprehensive information on all households
receiving TSA in real time regime. The TSA survey conducted within the project (October
2007-July 2008) preliminary estimated inclusion error at 30.6% (expected target was 40%).

Component 3: Pr oject Management and Monitor ing

13.     This component ensured professional implementation of the project by using appropriate
mechanisms of project management, and proper tools of project monitoring and evaluation. The
project management structure consisted of two Project Implementation Units (PIU) -one in the
MLSPP and one in the SSPF. PIU/MLSPP included a Project Director, Procurement Specialist
and a Financial Management Specialist and be reinforced by short-term outside expertise in
procurement and financial management as well as project implementation coordinator, architect,
IT expert group and office manager over. The PIUs also included an architect/engineer to
supervise implementation of civil works.

14.     The objective of this component is to support the operation of PIU within the MLSPP.
Since December 2006 PIU Director had moved to the Central Administration of the MLSPP as
the Head of Department for International Cooperation and received no payments from the
Project since then.. The fact that PIU Director became a member of staff of MLSPP had a very
positive affect in creation of synergy between MLSPP activities and Project implementation. IT
Expert Group was formed as a part of PIU to support and assist in implementation of the MIS
and sustainable development of future scheme of IT Strategy of the ministry. It included Team
Leader and 6 IT experts with future prospective to grow in numbers.


II.    RATING OF KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

15.     The development objective of PSAP has been to strengthen the capacity to plan and
implement reforms in social assistance policy and programs by modernizing the social assistance
administration (by adequately training staff and providing modern equipment), and by
consolidating fragmented benefits into a single targeted benefit. The poverty reduction program
(TSA) contains adequate actions whose implementation would ensure more efficient and
effective protection of the poor and vulnerable. This development objective is achieved by the
project as explained below by the status of outcome/impact indicators.

III.       BORROWER AND BANK PERFORMANCE

16.     The Government of Azerbaijan has since the initiation of the PSAP, remained committed
to the project objectives. The PIU was very active in coordinating the project. It had highly
motivated staff. This aspect, along with the increased cooperation from the different departments
of MLSPP, led to successful implementation of the project and achievement of Project
Objectives. The World Bank worked closely with the Borrower to support its efforts to
successfully implement the project. The dialogue during the implementation process was
smooth and both parties sought and found solutions to implementation bottlenecks (civil works
procurement and financial aspects). The World Bank supervised the project regularly and this
intensive supervision was one of the major contributing factors in achieving the targets.


IV.        LESSONS LEARNED

17.        The major lessons learned from PSAP are the following:

       •   Government ownership and active involvement by ministries and agencies in project
           implementation is crucial for project success and sustainability. Strong commitment and
           ownership needs to include both the technical and middle level management and staff.
       •   Government ownership over the project is reflected in the commitment of the MLSPP
           and SSPF in the design and preparation of their respective components.


                                                 39
     •   For complex programs, such as public pensions and social assistance, it is important to
         build a broad consensus for change. Experience from other countries underlines the
         critical importance of public information and training campaigns in building support. An
         important element of the project is aimed at creating public awareness of benefits.
     •   Implementation timetables need to be realistic and flexible to allow for limited agency
         experience in project implementation. Timetables were reviewed carefully during
         appraisal and found acceptable, and the pace of implementation will be monitored during
         implementation.
     •   Monitoring and evaluation is a key to project success; therefore, the project places great
         emphasis on strengthening the MLSPP and SSPF policy analysis and data gathering
         capacity.


V.       CONTRIBUTION BY THE SSPF

Achievements of PSAP

Component 2: Improving Social Insurance Administration

Sub-Component 2.a: Development of the MIS

18.     SSPF was responsible for development and installation of the Management Information
System (MIS) for automation of social insurance processes and maintaining a central register of
the social insurance system clients – employers, employees, pensioners. The main achievements
under this sub-component are the following:

19.     Refurbishing the SSPF Offices: At the beginning of implementation, most of SSPF
offices did not own their premises and were located mostly in rented offices. Conditions in the
offices were inadequate for proper client servicing. Initially it was planned to refurbish the
branch offices of SSPF in the framework of the PSAP. However, later on this objective was
removed from the Procurement Plan as renovation works was financed mostly by the
Government of Azerbaijan and partly by UNDP. SSPF built or renovated 74 branch offices out
of 86. All offices were equipped with modern computer hardware, power generators, stabilizers,
copy machines, etc. The PSAP project invested US$5.5 million in equipment and system
software. This allowed SSPF to create a solid ground for establishing the Management
Information System, increase performance, quality of services, accuracy of data and significantly
reduced the maintenance cost.

20.     Installation of MIS: Activities towards establishment of MIS started in 2003. SSPF
experts and PIU staff revised the existing legislation and designed the requirements for the future
MIS. While designing the MIS, the international consultants and PIU experts considered many
factors to be tackled: lack of human resources (especially in district offices) trained on ICT;
reluctance of local staff to accept the changes; large amount of data to be processed and stored
within relatively short timeframe, cost-efficiency of the system.




                                                40
21.    The MIS of SSPF was designed at three levels: Central (SSPF HQ), regional (10 offices
which are designated “regional? offices in terms of MIS administration) and rayon offices. All
86 offices of SSPF are equipped with modern servers, computer systems and other office
hardware.

22.     SSPF is utilizing an innovative server – thin-client technology. Azerbaijan is the first
country in CIS using this technology. Decision to use “thin clients? instead of PCs was governed
by several factors, such as huge economy in power consumption, economy on system software
licenses, labor discipline, data protection, application of advanced computer system
administration and maintenance techniques, etc. MIS has been installed in all SSPF offices,
including the offices serving the IDPs from the occupied territories, which were temporarily
located in other regions of Azerbaijan. The system is deployed at a level that meets current IT
needs, with the ability to add more in future. This ability to “right-size? provides a significant
reduction in total cost of ownership.

23.    SSPF is also establishing a Disaster/Backup center to ensure replication of all data stored
in HQ of SSPF in Disaster center as well as provide possibility to run the system from the
Disaster Center. Equipment for Disaster/Backup center was also procured in the framework of
PSAP.

24.     Development and implementation of functional software applications: The major
elements of MIS were developed, tested and installed in all branch offices of SSPF. It included
the following components:

   •   Registration of juridical and physical entities, landowners and farmers – employers
   •   Registration of employees (including self-employed)
   •   Processing of personal data, verification and validation of provided personal data
   •   Creation of individual accounts, generation of social security numbers
   •   Archiving of submitted documents, maintenance of electronic archives
   •   Registration of financial documents certifying payment of social contributions, fines, etc.
   •   Collection and processing of financial reports from employers
   •   Collection and processing of individual declarations
   •   Processing of financial data and budgeting
   •   Calculation of benefits
   •   Payment of benefits
   •   Electronic synchronization of databases between Ministry of taxes and SSPF in the
       framework of “One stop shop? approach in registration of juridical and physical entities
       (effective since January 2008).
   •   Provision of online access to personal accounts of registered population (in the process of
       development)
   •   Establishment of Intranet network
   •   Establishment of Extranet network (in the process of development)
   •   Remote inventory of computer hardware, control and administration of terminal servers
       (in the process of testing)
   •   Printing and mailing of notifications (in the process of development)

                                               41
   •   Establishment of disaster center (in the process of development and testing)
   •   Enhancement of security of computer system of SSPF (in the process of development)

25.     The developed MIS allows SSPF to process applications, declarations and other
documents submitted by participants of the social insurance and pension systems. SSPF provides
free access to special piece of software developed for employers in order to facilitate the process
of preparation and submission of quarterly financial reports. Recently SSPF developed and
uploaded to its web portal freeware software for pension calculation. Now everybody can
calculate its prospective pension amount by feeding few simple personal data into “pension
calculator.?

26.     Training of SSPF staff in the use of MIS: In 2009, most of SSPF employees were trained
on essential computer skills and application software developed for the MIS. The courses were
financed in the framework of PSAP. The training courses were provided to more than 900
personnel of SSPF from all branch offices. To maintain efficient operation of MIS and computer
system installed in all offices of SSPF, IT specialists from both IT department and PIU received
training courses.

27.    Establishment of IT department at SSPF HQ: An IT department of SSPF was established
in 2005. It includes 4 divisions: (i) Computer networking; (ii) Technical support to hardware and
software; (iii) Software development; and (iv) Automation of pension statistics. The main
responsibilities include development and running of pension assignment software, provision
technical support to hardware and local networks in branch offices, installation of licensed
standard software (such as operating systems, antivirus software, etc.). In 2010 SSPF started
transmission of elements of the computer system administration to SSPF IT specialists.

Sub-component 2.b: Operational Improvements in Business Processes and Institutional
Strengthening of SSPF

28.     The component envisaged provision of consultative support to SSPF in improvement of
the institutional and HR capacity of SSPF to ensure up to date and efficient conduction of
actuarial analysis, forecasting, policy analysis and implementation, public relations, training of
personnel, etc. The main achievements under this subcomponent are:

29.     Human Resource Development: A review of the SSPF HR policy was carried out and a
report was produced with recommendations for improvement of organization structure of SSPF
departments. These were acted upon by SSPF. Additionally, to enhance human resource
administration capacity of SSPF, HR department was equipped with specialized database system
that allows SSPF to maintain a centralized record keeping system with regard to its personnel.
The system contains all kind of data on SSPF employee – personal, qualification, service history,
awards, penalties, etc. A sophisticated search engine of the system lets SSPF administration to
determine the sought employees within seconds.

30.    Actuarial analysis: A group of 3 certified actuary specialists was established in the
framework of PIU and financed from PSAP. The group members have been trained on actuarial
analysis conducted by Canadian and Kazakh specialists and held under patronage of the Ministry

                                                42
of Finance of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The group provides assistance to SSPF in assessment
of liability of SSPF under existing pension scheme. The actuary group assisted an international
consultant who was invited for preparation of the TOR for development of the “Pension System
Development Strategy for the Republic of Azerbaijan?. They also review and do comparative
analysis of various well known actuarial models applied in various countries.

31.    Public Relations: In 2008, in the framework of PSAP, SSPF conducted its first survey
amongst 9,000 people to reveal the level of awareness of population in the area of social
insurance and pension provision. Right after that, nation-wide PR campaign was carried out to
increase awareness of population on the essence, principles and advantages of new social
insurance and pension provision systems. In the framework of the PR campaign, more 50,000
booklets were prepared and distributed, 300 posters placed in metro stations, audio and TV
commercials were prepared and put on the air. More than 100 articles were published, talk
shows and round-tables organized. All the mentioned activities were implemented with financial
support of PSAP.

32.     Another survey financed in the framework of PSAP was conducted in 2010. The
objective was to assess the effectiveness of carried out reforms in terms of sustainability and
increased level of satisfaction of population. The survey covered all Azerbaijan, including Baku,
Sumgait and other 10 regions of the country. About 2,500 respondents were surveyed
(individually and in various focus groups). The respondents represented employers, employees,
self-employed, unemployed people, landowners and pensioners. According to the survey report
most of the respondents are partially satisfied with the changes in social security and pension
system. 33% of all respondents mentioned increase of the pension’s amount and its timely
payment as the main achievement of the reform; 52% of respondents link the previous
achievement to intensive use of VISA cards and ATMs for pension delivery; and 11% believe
that application of modern ICT in social insurance contributed to improved quality of provided
services. The survey also highlighted the requirement for further improvement of the staff
qualification, and especially in the regional offices of SSPF.

33.     In order to increase the level of transparency of social insurance pension system in
Azerbaijan, it is planned to provide online access to individual social insurance accounts to
registered population in 2011. The participants of the social insurance system will have secure
web-based access to their personal accounts, where they will be able to check balance of social
security card, get notifications on changes in legislation, calculate the amount of deserved
pension, etc. Considering the fact that large part of population do not actively use internet 13,
especially in province, SSPF decided to maintain an alternative notification system to cover all
the system participants. For this purposes, SSPF procured in the framework of PSAP printing
and mailing equipment.

13
   The MLSPP and the SSPF submitted separate reports. This Annex summarizes the two reports. The individual reports are available in the
Project Files.




                                                                    43
Component 3: Project Management

34.   The project has been implemented under direct supervision of SSPF management. The
PIU was responsible for daily financial, procurement issues and coordination of project activities.

1. Coordination of PSAP activities: The PIU was responsible for implementation of the
   following duties:
   • Coordination at the Government level: Coordination of activities with the Ministry of
       Finance, Ministry of Economic Development, and submission of progress reports to the
       Cabinet of Ministers.
   • Coordination at SSPF level: Translation of needs of SSPF into Procurement Plan of
       PSAP, preparation of progress reports, provision of consultative services to SSPF on
       efficient use of opportunities provided in the framework of PSAP.
   • Coordination at the Project level: This included coordination of sub-components as well
       as with counterparts in MLSPP.
   • Coordination with the World Bank: The PIU has been in day-to-day contact with the
       World Bank for every project issue. In addition there have been at least two supervision
       missions every year during the PSAP implementation.
   • Coordination with relevant activities financed from other sources: The activities financed
       from joint UNDP/SSPF project were coordinated with the activities carried out under
       PSAP. Owing to that collaboration, SSPF managed to develop functional software for
       MIS, establish network in SSPF offices. A number of SSPF offices have been refurbished
       and furnished with furniture and LAN.

2. Monitoring and reporting on implementation progress:

      Reporting system for PSAP has been introduced to be on quarterly basis. These quarterly
      progress reports were prepared and submitted to the World Bank on time. PSAP
      performance was monitored closely through the list of key performance indicators.
      Progress towards key performance indicators was reported regularly during the
      implementation of PSAP. Mid-term evaluation was conducted in 2007.

3. Procurement plans:

      Procurement plans have been developed and updated always on time and procurement
      process followed implementation schedule of PSAP. Project disbursements under PSAP
      amounted to total of USD 6.7 million.


VI.    RATING OF KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

35.    The objective PSAP was to improve effectiveness and transparency in the provision of
public pension and social assistance to eligible beneficiaries. The achievement of the objective
was measured by the following indicators:

1. Improved financial viability of the social insurance system: Satisfactory

                                               44
        •    Social contribution collection increased from 59% in 2003 to 64.6 % in 2009 and
             expected to be over 70% in 2010 (for the first 9 month of 2010 this indicator was as
             much as 62%).
         • The share of transfers from the State budget to the SSPF decreased from 41% in 2003
             to 35% in 2009 and expected to be 31% in 2010 (for the first 9 months of 2010 this
             indicator was as much as 38%).
2.   Significant increases in the number of participating system contributors: Satisfactory
     The number of contributors continues to increase. SSPF covers 100% of formally employed.
     During 2003-2009 period, the total number of contributors increased by 40%. Among them
     the number of insured farmers increased for about 300% and the number of self-employed
     for about 600%.
3.   Eligible beneficiaries for pensions receive proper payments in a timely manner
     Achieved: Pensions are paid timely, without any arrears.
4.   Improved user satisfaction: Satisfactory
     The beneficiary survey showed that most of the system participants are partially satisfied
     with the changes in social security and pension system. 33% of respondents mentioned
     increase of the pensions and its timely payment as the main achievement of the reform; 52%
     link this to payment of pensions by means of VISA cards and ATMs; 11% link the progress
     to application of ICT and automation.
5.   A central register provides comprehensive computerized record-keeping of participants and
     flow of funds
     Achieved: A Central Register provides comprehensive computerized record-keeping of
     participants of the social insurance pension system. By the end of 2010 personal data for
     more than 1.8 million contributors and over 1.3 million pensioners were recorded in the
     databases of SSPF.
6.   Internal administrative processes are functioning according to guidelines
     Satisfactory: Established and functioning.
7.   Actuarial analysis used in long term forecasting
     Satisfactory:
     SSPF established an actuary group and started analysis of data required for building actuarial
     model.
8.   Functioning public information system in place
     Satisfactory:
     Public Relations department have been established in SSPF, which is responsible for various
     PR activities. Besides, SSPF publish its own newspaper, where, along with SSPF’s official
     web-site, information on changes in pension and social security law, news and information
     regarding activities of SSPF are provided. In the framework of project nation-wide PR
     campaign has been conducted; new tools for timely provision of information to population
     were introduced.
9.   Coherent human resources strategy applied.

                                                45
VII.      LESSONS LEARNED

36.    PSAP demonstrated the significance of international assistance in implementing of the
social security reforms in Azerbaijan. In spite of the large scale efforts undertaken by the
Government of Azerbaijan, the country is still lacking the required level of qualification and
experience in this area. Therefore, involvement of the World Bank in the social security sector
reforms and further development of the established agencies will be needed for the nearest future.

37.       The major lessons learned from PSAP are the following:

      •   Detailed design and planning of the project is a key factor for its successful
          implementation.
      •   Government ownership and active involvement of SSPF in project implementation is
          crucial for project success and sustainability.
      •   Good level of public information is critically important.
      •   Collaboration and data exchange between the state agencies should correspond to the
          needs of the current time. Unfortunately, except of some single cases this collaboration is
          not at the desired level.
      •   Qualified HR capacity is crucial to ensure sustainability of achievements. Lack of
          qualified human resources caused by lack of motivation among lower level staff might
          reduce the positive outcome.
      •   Formal performance appraisal linked to appropriate incentives is needed to motivate and
          reward personnel for high-pressure work environment.


VIII. BORROWER AND THE BANK PERFORMANCE

38.     From the beginning of implementation, the Government of Azerbaijan remained
committed to the project objectives. The total estimated Government contribution to the Project
implementation was as much as US$1.63 million. The PIU was very active in coordinating the
project. The highly motivated staff and the direct supervision by the SSPF top management lead
to successful implementation of the project and the achievement of the PDOs. The World Bank
worked closely with the Borrower to support its efforts to successfully implement the project.
Despite change in the Task Managers, the dialogue during the implementation process was
smooth and both parties sought and found solutions for handling of “bottlenecks.? The World
Bank supervised the project regularly (twice a year) and this intensive supervision was one of the
major contributing factors in achieving the targets. The World Bank positively reacted on two
requests from the Government of Azerbaijan for project extension from February 2009 to
February 2011. The World Bank’ assistance and performance was and is highly appreciated and
valued. The invaluable support and consultancy provided by the World Bank’s specialists
contributed to proper use of loan and development of efficient managerial and administrative
tools for SSPF.

IX.    PLANS FOR SUSTAINABILITY OF PSAP ACHIEVEMENTS

39.     Sustainability of the achievements obtained in the framework of PSAP will be ensured by
implementation of new project initiated by the Government and the World Bank “Social
Protection Development? project (SPDP). The major objective of SPDP is to further develop the
social security policy, introduction of new pillars, building actuarial capacity in SSPF and
models, HR capacity development, etc. Besides, the project will continue provision of IT support
to SSPF in maintaining of its MIS.
