PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA
SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECTS
LOANS 1277-YU, 1611-YU AND 1612/13/14-YU
Preface
This project completion report on Industrial Credits II, III and IV
covers the loans enumerated above. Industrial Credit II was approved on May
28, 1976 and closed on December 31, 1981. Credits III and IV were approved on
July 11, 1978 and closed on December 31, 1983.
The PCR was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Regional Office following a country visit in April-May 1986. The PCR is based
on a review of Appraisal Reports 1058-YU for Credit II and 1865a-YU for
Credits III and IV dated May 11, 1976 and June 23, 1978 respectively, and the
President's Reports Nos. P-1801a-YU deted May 14, 1976, P-2235a-YU dated
June 26, 1978 and P-2360-YU dated June 26, 1978 for Credits II, III and IV,
correspondence with the Borrowers and internal Bank memoranda, supervision and
audit reports, speciiic information submitted by the Borrowers for the PCR,
and PPAR No. 5119 dated June 11, 1984 for the Industrial Credit I (Loans
1012-YU and 1013-YU).
The PCR covers the implementation of 153 subprojects financed by
these Credits, and studies their broad characteristics. It also reviews
institutional developments in the four intermediary banks, which were the
Borrowers. The Borrowers were generally cooperative and helpful in the
ex?rcise.
In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures, this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
(CED) but. the projects were not audited by OED staff. Copies of the draft
report were sent to the Borrowers and their Regional Governments. Cotanents
received have been taken into account in finalizing the report and are
reproduced as Annexes 10 and 11.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA
SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECTS
LOANS 1277-YU, 1611-YU AND 1612/13/14-YU
HIGHLIGHTS
(i)      The five Loans for the three Projects reviewed in this report
constituted two Bank operations, in 1976 and 1978, following up on the First
Industrial Credit Project in 1974. Both operations aimed at the financing,
t.rough four financial intermediaries, of medium and small manufacturing
projects in four less-developed regions (LDRs) of Yugoslavia (Bosnia-
Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro), with the objective of reducing
regional imbalances, promoting institution-building, and mobilizing
supplementary foreign exchange resources. The 1978 operation (IC III and IV)
additionally emphasized the financing of labor-intensive enterprises (paras.
17-25).
(ii)     The investment financing objectives of the credits were met
successfully both in volume and in the quality of investment. The use of
funds deviated little from the estimates, both in terms of commitments and
disbursement (peras. 26-30). Subproiect cost overruns were 28% and 68X, on
average, respectively, for IC II and IC III/IV; the latter figure containing
large inter-bank differences. Financial and economic subproject performance
met the target for both operations; similarly, the employment creation targets
were met, and surpassed. Financing of two specially large projects in Kosovo,
and a technical assistance component for the same region, were also reasonably
well accomplished. The extent of foreign exchange co-financing obtained was
satisfactory (paras. 38-47). At present, between two-thirds and
three-quarters of the resulting subloan portfolios appear to be sound; the
remaining part is of uncertain quality, or unsound (paras 48-52).
(iii)    Institutional progress has been spotty and less satisfactory.
Appraisals ot subprojects by the borrowers are still lacking in depth and
coverage, and their project supervision is unsatisfactory. Data availability
and management information systems are also inadequate in many respects, with
individual inter-bank variances. Auditing arrangements have improved, but
further upgrading should still be expected (paras. 53-67).
(iv)     The fi,,ancial position of the borrowers cannot be established with
confidence, but appears weak, having deteriorated partly as a result of
unfavorable developments in the Yugoslavia economy. None of the banks has
established reserves and provisio\ua commensurate with known or potential
losses (paras. 68-76).



- ix -
(v)      The Bank/Borrower relationships have suffered from an apparent lack
of appreciation by the Borrowers of the merits of agreed-upon obligations and
also by their failure, seemingly due to their weak management information
system, to provide aderquate data, particularly on the condition of their
portfolio, to the Bank. Agreements and understandings have sometimes been
allowed to lapse (paras 77-82).
(vi)     The objectives of the two operations reviewed here were well defined
and suitable to the circumstances of their era, and the Bank's decision to go
ahead with them must be judged appropriate with the benefit of hindsight. The
investment objectives were, indeed, satisfactorily achieved. The institution
building aims, perhaps somewhat ambitious, had mixed results: while the banks
understood and used the Bank's approach to appraisal of projects, other
projects were not brought under similar purview; project supervision by the
banks showed little improvement; management information systems, and thereby
an enhancement of banks' efficiency, cid not receive the banks' deserved
focus. However, it is anticipated that a new Banking Law, enacted on December
20, 1985, should bring about important improvements in institution building.
Much of the thrust of this law could be ascribed to the Bank's
recommendations, made repeatedly during supervision, and appraisal,
missions.   Those mandatory requirements relate, in particular, to indepth
project appraisal and supervision, and financial practices, specifically on
adequacy of reserves and provisions.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA
SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH INLJSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECTS
LOANS 1277-YU, 1611-YU AND 1612/13/14-YU
This report covers five loans to four financial institutions in four
regions of Yugoslavia. They were implemented over a period of nearly 10 years
when very significant financial and economic changes took place. It would
therefore be difficult to assess the impact of the loans and how their
objectives were met without a brief review of the background against which
those loan were appraised and disbursed.
I. THE YUGOSLAV ECONOMIC, INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SETTING 1/
Basic Aspects of the Yugoslav Economic and Industrial System
1.       The Yugoslav economic system is characterized by social ownership and
control of the means of production, decentralization of political and economic
decision-making, and the principle of workers' self-management. The role of
the Federal Government in investment decisions and financing has progressively
lessened while that of republic and local governments, enterprises and the
banking system has increased. The new Constitution, promulgated in 1974,
provided for further delegation of power and decision-making to the regions
and the workers. The "Basic Organization of Associated Labor" (BOAL), the
smallest decision-making unit 2/, participates directly in decisions relating
to the election of management, production, pricing, investment, distribution
of income, etc., of its "Working Organization" (WO), or enterprise, in
accordance with the workers' "self-management agreement." The enterprises in
turn owned the banks and influence their budgets, operations, lending rates
and distribution of income through the banks' assemblies, which are composed
exclusively of the delegates of the member enterprises. Investment decisions
are initiated by enterprises and their proposals play a significant role in
the planning process at the various political levels and in the banking sector.
2.       Planning in Yugoslavia starts at the level of enterprises, within an
initial regional and federal macro-economic framework worked out by the
1/ Chapter I updates as necessary the initial chapter of the PPAM for the
Yugoslavia First Industrial Credit Project (Report No. 5119, datei June
11, 1984; submitted to the Executive Directors under covering memo
SecM84-556 dated June 19, 1984).
2/ The BOAL may, occasionally, have the characteristics of a full-fledged
"enterprise" (in the conventional terminology) or, more typically,
represents an economic and operating unit of a "Working Organization" (WO;
comprising also other BOALs "associated" by means of self-management
agreements. The term WO is commonly equated and translated, in this
report and elsewhere, as "enterprise."



-2-
planning institutes. The 1974 Constitution instituted detailed procedures to
render planning more realistic and implementation more effective than before.
Coordination of the investment plans of the enterprises, as well as
reconciliation of differences among enterprises at the republic and federal
levels, is the responsibility of the regional Chambers of Economy, which
represent all enterprises and whose intermediation is mandatory. The Federal
Planning Committee resolves disputes thaL may occur in the process of
self-management planning. At the end, consensus is expected to be reached
among all concerned on an integrated program of action. These agreements
(self-management agreements) are legally binding for the entire plan period
unless renegotiated. Projects cannot be initiated unless the sponsors have
secured the requisite funds. "anks a-e directed tc satisfy themselves about
the sectoral priority, location and economic and financial viability of the
projects, and secure commitments for the funds pledged, including their own.
In the absence of alternative allocation mechanisms (e.g. interest rates) in
this set-up, the allocative role of banks becomes essential.
Interest Rates
3.       In the 1970s and into the early '80s, it was argued in Yugoslavia
that interest rates perform no ma`or allocative function. That function was
supposedly effectiveiy discharged by the planning mechanism through the
process of specifying priority activities, the pro ects to be included in the
regional plans, and the attendant financial arrangements through the banking
system. The major part of the banks' resources in the Less Developed Regions
(LDRs) were provided from federal and regional funds on concessionary terms
and from borrowings on commercial terms. At the time the loans are being
made, interest rates on bank deposits and loans are also determined by the
banks' founders/members (i.e. by the banks' own borrowers). They will see to
it that lending rates are kept at low levels, allowirg for a spread on the
banks' various resources just adequate to cover their costs and statu'ory
obligations and leaving only a small surplus, as banks are not viewed as
profit seeking entities. Deposit and lending rates have traditionally been
negative in real terms, and the issue of these negative rates has been the
focus of many years of macro-economic and project dialogue between Yugoslavia
and the Bank.
4.       Yugoslavia's position has been that, if interest rates were to become
a significant consideration in investment planning, this would preempt the
dominant role of social planning in determining investment allocation.
However, in the early 1980s, in the context of growing domestic and
international financial difficulties and unprecedented high domestic
inflation, and following consultations with the IMF and the Bank, the economic
role of interest rates gained accaptance in Yugoslavia and made its way into
the 1981-85 Federal Plan. Under the 1983 SAL, the Government agreed to
increase gradually the lending rates to positive real levels by 1987-1989,
depending on sectors. The aims of the new policy were to stimulate savings,
improve resource allocation and quality of investments, and influence
consumption. Federal Fund resources and export credits were excluded from the
SAL agreements. From 1982 the Government began to adjust interest rates,
slowly at first and more frequently since 1984. The short-term dinar lending
rates increased from 9-16% in 1982 when inflation was 25X, to an average of



- 3 -
571 in the third quarter of 1985 when the annualized rate of inflation was
75-80X. During the same period, the long-term average dinar lending rates
increased from 7.5-11.52 to an average of 492. These lending rates are still
much below the inflation rate.
5.       Len'ling conditions in dinars differ from lending conditions in
foreign exchange. On the former, banks normally charge an interest spread
over and above the average cost of dinar resources. However, no interest rate
spread is allowed on foreign exchange loans and the associated banks (see
para. 7) onlend their foreign borrowings to subborrowers at the rate paid.
The foreign exchange risk is fully passed on to the subborrowers. To cover
administrative costs and build up reserves, the associated banks charge
foreign currency loans a "commission" equal, in percentage terms, to the
spread charged on dinar loans.
Lending and Investment Practices
6.       The impact of the banks in improving the quality of investment
decisions remains limited. While there are differences among banks, their
project evaluations in general are predominantly descriptive and are rarely
very searching or evaluative. The coverage of technical aspects, most of
which has been supplied by the investing enterprise, is generally good. The
economic analysis, by contrast, is mainly confined to the computation of
certain ratios, such as labor and capital efficiency indicators, but without
reference to a broader framework. Financial analysis is usually limited to an
assessment of the debt servicing capability of the project, based on the
financial projections of the sponsoring enterprise. Market analyses tend to
be scanty and perfunctory and often do not consider sufficiently existing and
forthcoming capacities in other regions. Price competitiveness is also not
adequately assessed. It has become increasingly clear that the 1977
structural reorganization of the banking system (para. 7) has weakened the
ability of the banks to make independent investment decisions and to monitor
the efficiency of investment projects (see para 56). 3/ The adoption and
wider application of sound methods for project selection, initially limited to
Bal.x supported projects but eventually to be extended to all investment
financing, has been one of the Bank's main objectives for continued lending to
the four banks in the LDRs. To strengthen the institutional mechanisms for
project evaluation, the 1983 SAL provided for an agreement that banks were to
establish uniform investment criteria for projects in various economic
sectors, including minimum economic rates of return calculated according to
the Bank's methodology. A social compact for application of investment
criteria has been adopted and guidelines for its application by the Banks are
now being finalized. But the process has been slow, and the timing for
implementation remains uncertain.
The Financial Setting
7.       Until 1977, multipurpose and investment banks were the dominant forms
3/ PBS emphasizes that they are independent, and responsible for investment
decision-making (Annex 10, para 6).



of financial intermediaries.4/ The share capital of these banks was owned by
their founder/member enterprises. The banks were organized in a head office
and a number of branch offices, with the power concentrated at the head
offices. The branches were legally independent entities and financially
autonomous, but the scope of their operations was limited by their statutes
and their resources (mainly deposits of their member). By law, the members
of a bank bore the unlimited subsidiary risk for its liabilities. The Federal
Banking Law of ..977 established a three-tier system consisting of (a) internal
banks, serving the internal banking needs of large enterprises; (b) basic
banks (the form(: branch offices of the multipurpose banks), handling mostly
commercial banking business and increasingly long-term lending; and (c)
associated banks (the former head offices of the multipurpose banks), involved
primarily in medium and long-term investment and permanent working capital
loans. 5/ The ownership of the bank's capital was also changed: the
enterprises which used to own the multipurpose banks now became owners of the
basic banks; the basic banks, in turn, ownied "their" associated banks. Of the
nine associated banks in operation in Yugoslavia, there is one in each
republic and autonomous province, with the exception of Serbia, where there
are two. The four banks supported by the Industrial Credit Projects under
review here are all associated banks and their shareholders comprise 28 basic
banks in the case of SBS, 22 of PBS, 13 of IBT and 7 of KBP.
8.       A new banking law, some basic features of which are summarized in
Annex 1, was enacted in December 1985, and will go into effect by January 1,
1987. ln the context of the Bank's Industrial Credit Projects it is important
to note, inter alia, that the new law proposes (a) to substitute limited
liability ownership for the present unlimited liability; (b) mandatory
auditing of the banks by SDK; (c) stricter enforcement of the requirements for
maintaining adequate equity, reserves and provisions; (d) mandatory,
"professional," evaluation of the economic merits of investment projects; and,
(e) very importantly, mandatory supervision, according to established criteria
and procedures, of loans and investments made, by "asLociated" as well as
"basic" banks. It is probably fair to say that many of these changes have
been inspired in part through the perennial discussions I'etween Yugoslav
authorities and IMF/IBRD. Provided that the new law will be followed through
and enforced with the necessary resolve and firmness, it should contribute to
considerable upgrading of the quality of investment financing, and of the
investments themselves. But at least another year or two will have to go by
before its impact on the banks and the economy can be assessed.
Other Recent Economic Developments
9.       While, during the 1960s and 1970s, Yugoslavia's economy grew rapidly,
averaging 62 per annum, growth has decelerated sharply .wre recently. Between
1980-83, the economy stagnated, then grew by 22 in 1984 and slowed again to
about a O.5Z growth rate in 1985. Despite this slowdown, social sector
4/  The Bank's borrowers, PBS, SBS, IBT and KBP, dominated investment aid
commercial banking in their respective regions.
5/ Long-term funds made available to the associated banks from Federal and
Republic/Province sources must be channeled on to the basic banks for
direct lending to enterprises.  Associated banks can make only foreign
currency loans directly to enterprises.



employment increased on average by 2.4S per year at the cost of declines in
labor productivity. Investment and imports were severely cut through the
restriction of aggregate demand and through the administrative allocation of
foreign exchange. Gross capital formation in 1985 was 631 lower than in
1980. To some extent, tne declines in investment and imports were adjustments
to unsustainably high levels in the 1970s, but the continuation of these
trends will have long-term effects on the economy's potential to grow and its
competitiveness in world markets. Export trends have been erratic with some
improvement following the devaluation in 1983.
10.      Inflationary pressures have accelerated and remain intense (Annex 2).
Inflation was 55X in 1984 and close to 802 in 1985. Real incomes per household
have, however, more than kept pace with inflation because of increases in
employment, interest income and windfall foreign exchange gains. Inflation
has been caused by a combination of cost push and demand pull factors. On the
cost side, efforts of the authorities to permit prices to reflect market
forces have put upward pressure on the price level. So have the cumulative
effects of the increases in nominal interest rates and the substantial
depreciation of the Dinar (Annex 2). On the demand side, monetary policy has
been less restrictive than intended. Ultimately, the persistence of inflation
must be ascribed to inadequate financial discipline at the enterprise and bank
levels, which allows enterprises to hold and finance high levels of
inventories in the face of flagging consumer demand. Moreover, severe
restr ctions on imports have contributed to maintain inflationary pressures
through reduced competition.
11.      Steps towards longer-term structural reform have been initiated, in
line with the Government's 1983 Long-Term Program of Economic Stabilization
(LTPES) and the Bank's 1983 SAL. The thrust of the LTPES is to increase
efficiency in resource allocation within the context of Yugoslavia's system of
workers' self-management.  Inter alia, prices of most goods and services were
freed from administrative control in early 1985 and horizontal price collusion
was proscribed. Interest rates on term deposits have increased substanitially
and reached 73 percent on April 1, 1986. Average lending rates remain
negative in real terms (para. 4). Legislation has been passed restricting
income pay-outs by loss-making enterprises, limiting their access to subsidies
and requiring that such enterprises either undertake rehabilitation programs
or close down. A new foreign exchange allocation system, introduced in
January 1986, eliminated the right of enterprises to retain foreign exchange
and hold foreign exchange accounts. Foreign exchange earnings must be fully
surrendered to the banking system. A new foreign credit law established
strict conditions for Yugoslav enterprises to borrow abroad, including the
requirement that all borrowers assume the full foreign exchange risk.
12.      Most of these measures are too recent for an assessment of their
effectiveness. On available evidence, the structural transformation so far
experienced by the Yugoslav economy in the 1980s has been limited. Export
trends have been erratic. Higher domestic interest rates, the passing of the
foreign exchange risk to borrowers, and the general shortage of local
resources have led to a more selective approach to investment. However, it
will probably take a long time before the structure of investment meets the
needs of the economy better than before. The very high level of inventories
points to a large share of savings being tied to stock build-up and raises

questions on the efficiency of overall resource use. It is important to keep
these tesues and preliminary conclusions in mind as one approaches the ex post
evaluation of the performance of Industrial Credit Projects II, III and IV.
13.      AJ described in this report, the industrial credit projects were
implemented in an overall satisfactorv manner despite serious economic
difficulties facing the country in tht 1980s. At the same time, continued
insufficient financial discipline resulted in bringing to the surface
weaknesses of the banking sy5Lam. 6/
II. THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT APPROACH
i4.      Between 1967 and 1973, the Bank used the Yugoslav Investment Bank
(YIB) as the conduit for loans to help modernize and expand 19 industrial
projects. Each end-user (enterprise) had to be appraised and monitored by the
Bank itself, assisted by YIB's administrative facilities. Although the Bank
made three loans of this type, it was soon to become apparent that this was a
very labor-intensive and cost-inefficient way of assisting Yugoslav industrial
enterprises.
15.      One of the reasons for taking this approach, rather than the by then
much more common Development Finance Company (DFC) line-of-credit approach,
was the Bank's practice at that time not to lend to state or government owned
and/or controlled financial institutions. Toward the late '60s, this
constraint was removed. Furthermore, with regard to Yugoslavia, it was
recognized that banks, like most other enterprises (or "BOALs", or "WOs"),
were owned and controlled by the wcrkers, or society-at-large, rather than by
the State or Government in a strict interpretation. These conclusions, when
held up against the impracticality of the YIB-type industrial financing
experience, led to the Bank decision that DFC line-of-credit financing should
replace ind.rect, conduit-type enterprise financing.
16.      In order to allow the Bank's assistance in industrial development to
focus on the Less Developed Regions (LDRs), one bank was designated in each of
the three Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Montenegro, and one
in tile Autonomous Province of Kosovo. They agreed to act, jointly and
severally, as DFC-intermediaries for a First Industrial Credit Project for
which two Loans totalling US$50 million (Loans No. 1012/13-YU) were granted in
May 1974. 7/ By 1976, these funds had been largely committed and, despite the
many problems and difficulties yet to be overcome, due to the uniqueness of
the Yugoslav economic system, in its macro as well as micro manifestations, a
Second Project (Loan 1277-YU) was prepared, and was approved in May, 1976.
This Project Completion Report (PCR) evaluates the Bank's experience with this
Second Industrial Credit Project (IC II) as well as the follow-on IC III & IV
projects approved in July 1978.
6/ PBS is of the view that the credit objectives are of high priority (i.e.
successful implementation and performance of subprojects), and "the
institution building of borrowers has been less important." (Annex 10,
para 7).

No. 5119, dated June 11, 1984.

III. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN
Obiectives
17.      The general objectives of the two operations (or three projects) 8/
were for the most part identical to those of IC I:
(a) the reduction of regional imbalances by selecting four of the least
developed regions (LDRs) -- Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia,
and Montenegro, -- aa target areas;
(b) the financing of medium and small industrial projects
(agro-industries excluded) with a normal maximum cost limit of US$6
million and US$10 million equivalent, respectively, under Credit II
and TV; 9/
(c) further inducement of and assistance in institution-building,
espec4.ally in the areas of project appraisal, project supervision,
staff skills, information systems and availability, and operational
and financial plan-ing;
(d) the development of more acceptable auditing procedures and audit
reports for the borrowing banks -- and for other banks in Yugoslavia
-- in accordance with internationally accepted auditing principles
and practices, in order to facilitate an assessment of the banks'
portfolio and investments, and overall financial soundness,
conforming to the Bank's own guidelines and practices;
(e) the objective of fo.reign exchange resource mobilization, alongside
with or supplementing the Bank loans, was more explicitly emphasized
and encouraged in 1976 as well as in 1978.
In addition, IC III/IV featured, as a new objective, that
(f) at least 25% of the "regular" 10/ loan amounts of the ICs would be
specifically allocated to labor intensive projects, defined as
projects providing employment at a maximum cost per job of US$23,000
equivalent. 11/
8/  The first operation IC-II (Loan 1277-Y'U'  covered the four banks:  SBS,
IBT, PBS, SBS. The second operation co%ered the same four banks through
two credits (IC-III and IC-IV) and through four loans, loan 1611-YU for IC
III (KBP) and loans 1612 (PBS), 1613 (SBS) and 1614 (IBT) for IC-IV.
9/ IC III (KBP) represented, in part, a special case with regard to project
size; see paras. 19-20.
10/ Excluding the extra US$20 million under IC III (KBP) to be used for a
couple of very large projects ("Special Projects") (paras. 19-20).
11/ This being the estimated "threshold figure" for Yugoslavia as defined
under the Bank's urban poverty program.



-8-
Prolect Design
18.      For IC II, the four banks acted as co-borrowers, jointly and
severally, for the Loar, amount of US$50 million, which was to be allocated
amongst them in exactly the same amounts and proportions as IC I (PBS, 321;
SBS, 11.42; IBT, 6.02; KBP, 33.2%). One of the banks (SBS) acted as the
fiscal agent, waintaining separate, subsidiary loan accounts for each bank.
Each bank was to establish an "IBRD Unit" to deal with administrative
functions pertaining to the Loan, and the four Units, acting in concert,
constituted a Joint Unit to speak for all via-a-vis the Bank, when necessary.
However, different from IC I, each bank would deal directly with the Bank in
matters of sub-loan submission and follow-up; no Joint Unit endorsement was
required. The same set-up was maintained for IC III and IV.
19.      Credits III and IV took one further step in the same direction, in
that there were four loans, and each bank stood as the borrower and obligor
for its own loan only. Because of its special features (para. 20), KBP was
singled out as both a Credit Project (III) and a Loan (1611-YU) to itself,
while the three other banks together constituted IC IV (Loans 1612/14-YU).

20.      The rationale for Kosovo's (KBP) receiving double the Loan amount of
each of the other three banks was the censideration that KBP had special
difficulty to mobilize foreigh exchange and also the inclusion in KBP pipeline
of two or three large projects which were preappraised by the Bank under a
special procedure. The technical assistance component ($300,000) was designed
to help KBP in "identifying, preparing and then appraising projects in new
fields (f.ex., diversifying from basic industries to processing industries)."
Inter alia, this sum would help pay for appropriate training of KBP staff, and
specialist assistance in the appraisal of large projects. The idea was sound.
21.      To encourage the mobilization of other foreign exchange financing,
two devices were introduced, in IC II as well as IC III/IV. First, while the
Bank would normally allow subloans to have a grace period of up to three



-9-
years, it agreed that this could be stretched to 6 years (IC II) or 5 years
(IC III/I) if suitable foreign co-financing for the same project were brought
in, in order that such typically 3-7 years' term loans could be fully or
substantially repaid before the full burden of the Bank Loan service set in.
Second, the Bank also agreed that, while financeable subprojects should
normally (under IC II) have a total cost of no more than US$6 million, up to
US$10 million would be acceptable with suitable co-financing brought in.
Under IC III/IV, the normal maximum project cost was set at US$ 10 million;
but the trigger to waive this limit was the relative labor-intensity;
specifically, the estimation that employment would be created at a total cost
per iob of *40,000 or less.
22.      "Free limits" for sub-loan approvals were raised from $200,000 for
IC-I to $500,000 (IC II) and $1,000,000 (IC III/I). In retrospect, despite
shortcomings of appraisal and supervision these higher limits were probably a
matter of practicality. However, quality improvements in the banks' project
apprairals could not fully justify these raises, and more stringent Bank
reviews would probably have had a better pay-off, in terms of quality, in the
long run. 12/
23.      Sub-loans were normally not to exceed US$2.5 million (IC II) and
US$3.0 million (IC III/IV) -- compared with US$2.0 million under IC I. Tn a
few cases, slightly higher subloans were allowed.
24.      As under IC I, there was an undetstanding, between the Bank and the
borrowers, tthat the Bank, in its approach to institution-building, would
largely limit itself to those aspects having a direct, or indirect but real,
bearir.g on the banks' capabilities and performance in carrying out the
Industrial Credits and, by extension, in making other long-term project loans
and investments. The minutes of the negotiations of the Second IC reflect --
especially in para 4 -- the high sensitivities of the Yugoslav negotiators on
this matter. Hindsight, and perennial difficulties in obtaining certainl data
from the banks, especially relating to the position of their portfolios,
suggest that the Bank may have been too accomnodating in this matter.
(Chapter VII)
25.      All in all, with these qualifications, both the 1976 and the 1978
Industrial Credits were well designed, and represented in several respects
(e.g., dispensing with the Joint Unit's pre-approval of subprojects for Bank
approval; co-financing, and grace periods) improvements over the First IC
(1974). The projects, as designed, reflected a pragmatic comptomise betweern
what the Bank really wanted and what appeared to be possible at that stage of
the relationship between the Bank and its borrowers. While the Bank viewed
institution-building as long-term process, hindsight suggests that, more
sp(;cific guidelines should have been drawn up and enforced for project
appraisal as well as project follow-up at these early stages of interaction;
as a result some of the problems that still linger on today could probably
have been much alleviated.
12/ PBS makes the point that the higher "free limits" have resulted iil better
utilization of the loans without adverse consequences on subproject
selection or performance (Annex 10, para 8).

IV. UTILIZATION OF BANK FUNDS
Timeliness of Utilization
26.      For the most part, a-ppraisal estimates of commitments as well as
disbursements under the three Industrial Credits turned out to be quite close
to actual performance. The same applied, with some exceptions, to the
estimates for individual Loans. Details of commitments will be found in Annex
3, and of disbursements in Annex 4.
27.      By the original termir.al date for commitments for Loan 1277-YU
(December 31, 1978), more than 921 had been committed of the combined total,
within a range of 84X for the lowest (PBS) to 1002 for the highest (SBS) use.
Loans 1611/14-YU (IC III & IV) were even more strikingly on the mark, with
total commitments at the original target date (June 30, 1981) at 98.1Z, and
only negligible variances amongst the banks (range 952-99X). The deadline
extensions 7or commitments were, therefore, in all cases a pure formality to
allow the banks the use of de minimis balances.
28.      Deviations between estimated and actual disbursements were somewhat
wider, although reasonably on schedule. The following table illustrates this
performance. 13/

29.      Total disbursement of 89% (IC II) or 84% (IC III/IV) by the original
Closing Date is good by Bank/DFC standards.
13/ PBS points out that large intercurrency changes, particularly under IC III
and IV, resulted in major savings during subproject implementation which
enabled the banks to finance additional subprojects. PBS emphasizes that
this benefit is not available under other Bank loans (Annex 10, para 9).



- II -
30.      Disbursement of IC III was completed in the second quarter of 1981,
less than a half year after the original Closing Date; and of IC III/IV in the
third quarter of 1984, about 20 months after the original Closing Date. Small
balances (IC II: $2.3 million; IC 11I/IV: $3.8 million; 4.6% and 3.8X, res-
pectively,) were eventually cancelled, due to unused balances under individual
subprojects. For all three ICs, timeliness of fumd utilization was quite
satisfactory.
Subproject Characteristics
31.      Annex 5 provides a breakdown of all subloans under the three ICs,
in consolidated form. Where there have been significant differences between
IC II (1976) and IC IrI/IV (1978), or where otherwise especially relevant, the
distinction will be noted in the following. 14/
32.      Regional distribution.  The five Loans, totalling US$150 million,
were distributed amongst the LDRs of Bosnia-Herzegovina wi:h $36 million
(24X), Kosovo $56.6 million (37.71), Macedonia $31.4 million (20.9%), and
Montenegro (Crna Gora) $26 millioni (17.4X). The distribution was not only
determined by joint Bank/borrowers' perception of absorptive capacity, but
also influenced by representation of special needs, especially so for Kosovo.
33.      Subsector distribution.  Only one subsector, metals and machinery
processing, really stood out in importance, accounting for 53, or one-third,
of a total 153 subloans, and 45% by amount. Textiles and wood processing
ranked next, by amount.
34.      Subproject size.  Subprojects were fairly evenly spread, on the whole
and for individual Credits, over the whole range of allowable total cost
ranges; usually limited to $10 million equivalent for all three ICs, but with
exceptions (see paras. 17(b) and 21). The two Kosovo "special projects" under
IC III, for which $20 miilion extra had been allocated under Loan 1611-YU, had
estimated total costs of $31.3 million (battery plant) and $25.4 million (lead
smelter) (- para 45).
35.      Project implementation time.  The average, estimated, weighted time
for subproject completion, from date of approval by the banks, was 1-2/3
years, with only about one-third of the projects exceeding 2 years. Taking
into accotnt delays, actual completion time would be about 2 years, on
average. This appears a reasonable time span. Some serious misjudgments were
made, but not on such a scale as to detract from the banks' generally good
judgment in this respect.
36.      Other features.  As expected at appraisal, most lending was really
long-term, with a preponderance of subloans (777 by amount, 727 by number)
exceeding 10 years, including the grace period. More than two-thirds (697) of
the projects were for expansion or modernization; the remaining one-third
(31S) for new enterprises. Projects were very predominantly (89X, by number)
located in urban areas, but the absolute number aa well as proportion of

projects financed in rural areas increased somewhat from IC II (5 projects of
64, or 7.81) to IC III/IV (12 projects of 89, or 13.5X). 15/
Subproject Performance
37.      Annex 6 is a consolidation of all subproject financing and
performance data collected from the four banks. An analysis of some main
aspects follows.
38.      Cost overruns.  Data on cost overruns are available for 53
subprojects under IC II and for 89 subprojects under IC III/IV, as follows:

While inter-bank coGt overruns for IC II are fairly uniform, PBS and IBT stand
strikingly out from KBP and SBS under IC III/IV. Also, overruns under IC
III/IV are almost 2-1/2 times those of IC II. The latter phenomenon is in
lerge degree explained by the difference in the inflation -ate between the two
implementation periods.  Most disbursements under IC II tou. place between
1977-79, when inflation averaged about 161 p.a.. When IC III/IV was
disbursed, mostly between 1980-82, average inflation was over 341. As to
inter-bank differenc2s, the project data show that PBS and, to some extent,
IBT, erred more in their estimates. PBS, under Loan 1612-YU (IC IV), had 12
subprojects out of 36 with cost overrums of more than 1001, 6 subprojects with
more than 200%, and 3 subprojects with overruns of 4841, 5011, and 6602,
respectively. Inflation notwithstanding, this represents very poor cost
estimates. 16/
39.      Financial and economic performance.  Minimum FRR and ERR were set,
for all three ICs, to 111. The tables show no subproject that did not meet
this requirement, as estimated or in actual fact. 17/ Mean returns are as
follows:
15/ Some areas classified as "urban" could probably more appropriately be
called "semi-urban", "small-town", or "village"; hence, not too much
importance should be attached to these statistics.
16/ PBS confirms that inflation has caused cost overruns, particularly for
subprojects with long gestation periods. PBS also mentions that there
were no overruns on the Bank-financed portion of subprojects (Annex 10,
para 10).
17/ Data only for "A" subprojects, except for KBP.

These figures should be taken as iudicative, as it is siuspected that actual
returns are often based on insufficient information. roreover, though a
majority of projects are for expatision, the estimated returns are not
incremental, but apply to the enterpr.ie (BOAL or WO) as a whole. Inspite of
this, FRRs and ERRs by and large probably have met the 11% requirement.
40.      Employment creation.  Under Loan 1277-YU (IC II), 11,530 jobs are
reported to have been created, at a total proiect cost of US$246.3 mnillion
equivalent. This corresponds to a cost per job of about $21,400. The
objective (para. 16(f)) that at least 25X of the "regular" Loan amount of IC
IlI/IV, or $20 million, would be used for labor-intensive projects, with a
maximum cost per job of $23,000, does not, against this back?round, appear
very ambitious.
41.      Under IC III/IW, 89 subprojects were financed, at a total estimated
project cost of $206.8 million, creating 11,831 new jobs. The cost per Job,
on average, was $18,831. Of the 89 subprojects, 21 were estimated, at
appraisal, to be labor-intensive, by the agreed definition.

Thus, all four banks met, and exceeded, their 252 labor-intensive subproject
quota.

42.      The table shows that the average cost per job (based on actual jobs
created) of "labor-intensive" subprojects was only about half the $23,000
threshold figure. Apparently it was easy for the banks to identify projects
satisfying the criterion. The Bank could either have chosen a lower threshold
figure, or set a higher proportion of subloans to which i, was to apply, in
order for the employment creation objective to have been even more effective.
43.      Export features.  An attempt to collect data on the export
performance of subprojects was made, but was not very successful. The main
problem turned out to be the difficulty in discerning between the exporting
impact of the subprojects per se and of the enterprise as a whole. As
subprojects were overwhelmingly in the expansion category, this rendered much
of the data received difficult to analyze.
44.      Nevertheless, it appeared that 47 of 64 subloans (or 73X by number)
under IC II, and 59 of 89 (or 66X) under IC III/IV, were to exporting
enterprises. That in itself leads to the conclusion that the three ICs must
have had an impact on exports. It is estimated that between 202-302 of new
production created went for exports.
45.      Kosovo:  Special projects and technical assistance.  Originally,
$18.1 million of the especially allocated $20 million was committed for two
large projects, a battery plant and a lead smelter, both WOs of the Trepca
Kombinat (conglomerate). The latter was perhaps the more interesting one, in
that it aimed at reducing air pollution problems to acceptable levels.
Consultants prepared feasiblity studies for both projects; they have both been
successful, although the lead smelter project had to be reduced, due to long
delays, in scope, and in subloan size, from $8.3 million to $4.9 million.
46.      The technical assistance component of $300,000 for KBP was only used
to the extent of about $186,000. Of this, the greatest portion ($117,500) was
used to pay a foreign consulting firm for an agro-industrial project study;
$21,500 for the consultants' study on the Trepca lead smelter, and about
$50,000 for KBP staff training. As far as can be judged, all of these funds
were put to good use.

47.      Foreign exchange co-financing.  The efforts to mobilize supplementary
foreign exchange financing produced reasonably satisfactory results under both
operations. Under IC II, 15 known projects attracted about $22 million,
aluout equivalent to Bank suoloans of $24-25 million for the same projects.
PBS was most successful in this respect, but all four banks had some results
to show for their efforts. Actual results, in number terms, have not been
obtained for IC III/IV, but were described in a subsequent report as "a
satisfactory level of co-financing", estimated to have been of the order of
magnitude of perhaps $40 million. Hence, the longer grace periods (up to 5-6
years) allowed under the Bank Loans seem to have served their purpose, and
were continued under IC V.
48.      Quality of subloan portfolio.  The health of the subloan portfolio
has not been satisfactorily disclosed by the borrowers duri.ag Bank supervision
of its loan or in answer to the questionnaire prepared for the preparation of
this PCR. Two banks (PBS and SBS) have not accepted to provide data on the
arrears affecting subloans. 18/ Also while IBRD subloans are serviced on
time, this may have been at the expense of other loans made to the same
company which are in default.
49.      An assessment of the subloan portfolio can however be derived from
the classification presented below where subprojects are distributed between
five categories, A (best) through E (worst).

50.      The ranking of the projects has been done by the banks themselves
and, for that reason, comparison amongst the banks could perhaps be unfair and
misleading. Sample tests and project visits indicate, though, that the banks
have been realistic in their assessments. Therefore, this ranking is believed
to represent, overall, an acceptable basis for a judgement on the status of
the subloan portfolio. 19/
51.      Table 7 shows that 731 of all projects under IC II, and 691 under IC
III/IV, are problem-free, or having only minor problems. Between 27Z-31Z are
afflicted with problems of a more serious nature. Thus, between two-thirds
and three-fourths of the subloan portfolios may be broadly characterized as
"sound".
52.      These findings indicate a satisfactory performance, especially in
view of the increasingly difficult economic environment in which enterprises
have had to operate during the past several years. Sales and marketing are
cited as a main problem area in 411 of all problem cases; financial problems
come second with 272. Technical production problems are cited as a factor in
11% of the cases, management in 91, qualitv or design problems in 7%, and
"other problems" in 5%. This underscores the findings of the Bank, in its
review of subproject appraisals, that market studies were generally a weaker
aspect. Management problems, on the other hand, may have been somewhat
tuderstated in Table 7.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PROGRESS
;3.      In IC II, the institutional focus wag described in somewhat broad
terms, and although not so precisely stated in IC III and IV, the intention
appeared to have been to continue this comprehensive approach. Given the
rather unique situation of the banking system in Yugoslavia, this DFC-type
concept towards institution building might, in retrospect, have proved to be
overly ambitious. In a socio-political atmosphere, with whose nuiances the
Bank was unfamiliar at the time of these ICs, a less ambitious and
program-oriented, long-term approach to institution building would have
improved the chances of success.
54.      Role of IBRD Unit.  During these early ICs, Bank strategy evolved to
addressing institutional improvements in banks through specialized units
within their respective organizations focussing on ICs, particularly
subproject appraisal and supervision functions, and initially, these units did
show some promise in training staff and in appraisal methodology. Ihis
approach was probably justified at the beginning given the size of the banks
and the difficulty to establish a first relationship at the operational level
which could be focused and monitored and could become the starting base for a
wider influence of the Bank on the overall operations and methods of the
oanks. However, in part due to insufficient staffing, but also due to the
inadequate status of these units within the overall bank organization, they
,ould not perform their role satisfactorily, and becarne a material obstacle
for Bank missions to gain direct ascess to other departmen's of the banks.
i9/ in the "adjusted percentages" column in the table, the only change mAde is
that about I out of 4 projects ranked "B" have been reclassified as '"C".



- 17 -
After more than ten years of a lending relationship with these banks, the need
for an artificial enclave for IBRD loans had probably disappeared. The Bank's
goal should now be to maintain a direct relationship with the overall
mnuagement and operation system.
55.      In spite of tangible improvements, achievements were slower than
expected. The June 1984 PPAR on IC I recognized disappointing performances on
appraisal (para 56 below), supervision (para 58) and external audit (para
64). This stern conclusion remains a major issue today with increasing
acuteness in the light of the deteriorating economic condition. 20/ The
institutional changes which the new banking law supports have still to take
form and to be assessed on their merit.
Project ADDraisals
56.      Improvement in scope, structure, analysis and substance has been
achieved by all four banks in their appraisals of Bank subprojects. There i&
little reason to differentiate amongst the banks as to the degree of
improvement, or shortcomings still to be remedied. However, the number of
such projects (above the free limit) is relatively small (24 under IC II; 22
under IC III/IV), and none of the banks has yet adopted the "World Bank
appraisal methodology" for non-Bank financed investment projects. The reason
for this is complex. On the one hand, the banks have been too dependent on
their founders/clients to be able to challenge the economic and financial
strength of their investmeuit projects. 21/ On the other hand, the banks have
sometimes questioned the wisdom of applying systematically to ilvestment such
tests as FRR and ERR, financial forecasts, sensitivity analyses, market and
competition research. The banks have preferred to rely on regionally
established industrial development plans, the assignment of priority to
projects under these plans, and their own bankers' common sense judgment to
arrive at investment decisions. In any case, a strong argument can be made to
justify the patience of the Bank approach during this period when both parties
were still learning, an a necessary process in order to Keep the dialogue open
and gradually obtain a better convergence of views as demonstrated in the
20/ An important milestone in the Bank's evolving approach toward
institutional development took place, a few years later, as part of IC
VII. For this credit, approved in July 1983, the Bank appointed a
consultant to prepare an indepth study of KBP's policies, procedures,
organization, management and staffing. His recommendations were included
in a comprehensive institutional plan which was negotiated and agreed
under the project. It included staff development and training,
improvement of procedures for subproject approval, creation of an
independent department to follow-up subproject implementation, internal
auditing, and introduction of a new management information system (MIS).
Except for the new MIS (for which KBP is currently considering purchasing
suitable computer equipment) the program has been largely implemented and
the quality of appraisal of Bank financed subprojects has improved
significantly. A similar, though less elaborated, program was also
initiated under IC VII with IBT.
21/ PBS disagrees with this view (Annex 10, para 15).

early eighties by the approval of SAL I and by the recent changes in the legal
and institutional framework. 22/
57.      During the Bank supervision of IC II, III and IV, these issues
emerged more clearly and the Bank did intensify its efforts in the direction
of more structured evaluation and analysis of investment projects and
supervision under the Sixth (1982, for PBS and SUS) and Seventh (1983, for
IBT and KBP) Industrial Credits, and with appreciably better results in terms
of "A" appraisal reports approved for sub-loan financing. Finally, as noted
in paragraph 8, the new Banking Law enacted in December 1985 now requires all
banks to carry out professional economic evaluations of the merits of
investment projects.
Project Supervision
58.      Throughout the Bank's Industrial Credit association with the four
banks project supervision has been a seriously neglected area of the banks'
performance. Efforts by the Bank to upgrade this activity have had little
effect since, despite verbal and written assurances, the banks remained
unconvinced, at least until the serious economic decline in the '80s (paras.
9-10), of the need for a systematic, programmed and structured supervision
system. They also believed that the basic banks, which supply short-term
financing for most enterprises concerned, ensured adequate supervision through
their contacts with their clients. As a result, supervision guidelines agreed
upon during the appraisal of IC II were never fully acted upon. The Sixth
(PBS, SBS) and Seventh (IBT, KBP) ICs, in 1982 and 1983, were more critical of
the banks' supervision efforts, and agreed with the banks on specific
supervision systems and programs that were supposed to be introduced
immediately, and to become fully operational within a few months' time (by the
end of 1982 for PBS/SBS; by September, 1983 for IBT/KBP). (In the context of
the PPAM for IC I, PBS explained in its letter of April 24, 1984 that PBS and
SBS had decided, in the interest of better staff utilization, to maintain an
integrated, instead of separate, department for project appraisal and
supervision). Initially, the new supervision program would embrace all
Bank-supported projects, but would be broadened as soon as possible to all
industrial projects using long-term financing, regardless of source. All
banks agreed to increase their super- vision staffs substantially: PBS by 15,
SBS by 6, IBT by 6, and KBP by 10, all professional staff.
59.      During the PCR mission, in May 1986, it still seemed that these
agreements had not been fully implemented in the sense that none of the banks
had effectively established the systems agreed upon or increased their staffs
as agreed. While they all admitted to having shirked on supervision, they
also all referred to supervision being, first and foremost, the task of the
"basic" banks -- their owners -- to whom, allegedly, they could not issue
specific instructions. However, KBP and IBT have recently established, under
Bank guidelines, separate supervision departments for monitoring IBRD
subprojects.
22/ PBS mentions that good results by subprojects (paras 51 and 52) "prove
proper and good selection of the subprojects"; PBS also underscores the
difficulties in the appraisal of internaticaal markets (Annex 10, para 2).



- 19 -
60.      While "the Bank's complacency with supervision seem to have
contributed to the existing (unsatisfactory) situation" 23/ which prevailed
under IC II and III and even later, some of the positive changes provided for
in the 1985 Law on the Bases of the Banking and Credit System (Annex 1) with
regard, inter alia, to project appraisal and monitoring, can be ascribed, at
least in part, to strong encouragement from the Bank. In a broad sense, the
recent changes in law and the response it appears to receive from the banks
support the proposition that, while marginal changes and improvements in
banking practices can be introduced with institutions individually, more
fundamental, significant improvements will be achieved, through fiat, at the
macro-level.
Mana^__ent Inform tion Systems (MIS)
61.      Difficulty in obtaining reliable information from the banks has been,
and continues to be, a handicap to smooth relations between them and the
Bank. The issue was first raiqed during appraisal and negotiations of IC II,
in the context of obtaining data pertaining to the status of the portfolios.
It has never been fully resolved. Furthermore, AS stated in PPAR I (para. 20),
although computerized data processing facilities have been existing in all
four banks since about 1976-78, none of them has as yet developed adequate
systems in such matters as financial planning, management monitoring of
project appraisal and supervision work, and feedback from actual project
experience.
62.      In recent discussions (in 1985 and 1986) of the Bank with the Federal
authorities and Yugoslav banks regarding future possible industrial credits,
all the questions discussed here (e.g. on appraisal, supervision, financial
discipline) have been raised, and the Bank has indicated that significant
progress on all of them would, after ten years of intensive dialogue, have now
to be addressed in a clear way. Such clarity would have in particular to be
based on a reasonably transparent MIS.
External Audit
63.      From the outset, the Bank attached much importance to having
acceptable external audits of the borrowing banks undertaken, and arrangements
to this effect, with the banks and with Yugoslavia's Social Accounting Services
(SDK), were agreed upon already under IC I. The scope of the audits was to
conform substantially to the Banks "Illustrative Form of Audit Report for
Development Finance Companies" (January 1973). .n fact, the four banks were
advised, in 1974, "that further IBRD assistance will depend, inter alia, on
the success of the auditing program". 24/ The original assumption that it
would take "a year, at the least" before SDK could produce audits "acceptablc.
to international financiers, including IBRD" was clearly optimistic and that
was recognized in the appraisal of IC II ('.976), when a new target of having
"full audits" after an additional two or three years was set.

61.      Subsequent Bank appraisal reports generally expressed satisfaction
with the progress made on auditing, its scope and contents. However, in 1983,
under SAL, and in the ap_-aisal of IC VII (for IBT and KBP), the Bank pointed
out, to the banks and the Government, that there had been non-compliance with
Yugoslav law concerning the establishment of certain provisions and reserves,
and the two banks directly concerned at that time agreed on a timed program to
rectify the situation. SDK audit reports will usually conform to the scope
set out in the "Illustrative Form". The reports certify as to the legality
and correctness of figures, and supply useful performance indicators.
However, they do not always allow a creditor to assess the financial soundness
and creditworthiness of the banks. The most serious shortcoming continues to
be the absence of an independent SDK opinion, in its reports, on the quality
of the portfolio of loans and investments, on the adequacy of collateral or
other securities, and on the adequacy, or lack thereof, of reserves and
provisions. In this, the SDK auditors have so far preferred to defer almost
exclusively to views expressed by the banks' managements. 25/
65.      The SDK audit reports, therefore, are still of limited value to a
creditor like the Bank, or to the audited bank itself. They will continue to
be so as long as the SDK auditors do not state more explicitly their own
oFinioti on the overall quality of the bank's portfolio, based on their own
sampling and tests, and on the adequacy of reserves and provisions, for
doubtful loans and investments. Although not now expressly stipulated in the
auditors' terms of reference (the "Illustrative Form"), it is commendable that
the SDK, since 1979, has started including an analysis of the arrears
situation of the banks. This analysis would be rendered even more useful if
it could be broadened and elaborated upon, e.g., by relating the amoCunlt of
loans affected by overdue interest tn the bank's total portfolio, by
classifying defaulting loans as to the measures taken to collect then (e.g.,
no special measures; under rehabilitation; under intensive collection efforts;
under preliminary court proceedings; under advanced court proceedings; ulnder
liquidation, et al), and, importantly, by adding loan collection ratios and
data on loans rescheduled.  More generally, the time has come for the Banlk to
review, with the banks, the Government and SDK, the scope of the external
audit with a view to strengthen weaker areas such as the ones referred to. and
to enhance the usefulness of the audits to all parties legitimately
25/ Typically, a statement along the following lines will be found in SDK
reports: "At [date], there were past due loans of approximately
[amount]. The bank believes that all known losses have been identified.
The loans incurred due to discontinued projects will be covered by the
Republic.  Based on tne bank's past loan loss experience and the
likelihood that overdue loans will either be rescheduled or enterprises
which experience loss or financial difficulties will be rehabii.tatied with
no loss to the bank, and based on the security disclosed in Note   i
bank management do not anticipate any significant amounts of poss.ihie
future losses." (Emphasis added.)

concerned.26/ Given the encouraging direction provided by the new Banking
Law, the time is probably ripe for a review and revision of the scope of the
audits in the light of present day needs of owners, managers and lenders to be
better informed on the financial viability and status of these institutions.
Training of Staff
66.      Some training of banks' staff has taken place in recent years,
especially in the case of KBP reorganization under IC IV. However, more
systematic training of the banks' staff, in disciplines such as appraisal and
supervision, management information systems, use of computers and computer
programs, aspects of management, etc. is required. Recent efforts under the
management of the Yugoslav Bankers' Association are starting to pay off. This
aspect should remain one of priority in the Bank future program.
Suouing Up
67.      The Bank's efforts at institution building have, for a variety of
reasons, met with limited and at least slow success. The recent economic
recession, combined with the elimination of the safety net provided by the
Federal Solidarity Fund, a fund which helped to refinance enterprise losses,
has revealed even more than in the past that the issue of institutional
development has assumed substantial importance. The Bank's attention to this
aspect was too long to develop; it became a priority concern only under IC V
and VI. After more than 10 years of discussion with the banks on principles
and methods, the Bank should, in the future, emphasize implementation of
agreed objectives for appraisal, supervision, institution building, training
and auditing, and, of paramount importance, an insistence on obtaining
meaningful data on the banks' financial positions. The current support given
by Yugoslav banks as a result of the new Banking Law would justify to renew
now the Bank's effort in this direction.
VI. FINANCIAL POSITION
General
68.      Creditworthiness of the four banks was an issue under IC I.  The
appraisal report concluded (para. 3.49) that "it is simply not possible,
pending an audit, to establish the creditworthiness of the banks as
independent organizations." It also concluded that the banks' close
integration into the economies they were serving and the fact that their
credit was fully guaranteed by the founders, made liquidation of the banks
26/ Reference is made to the Bank's "blue book" of March 1982, entitled
"Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by
the World Bank", especially para. 3.10, according to which "... it may be
appropriate for a borrower to request that attention be given by the
auditors to specialized matters relating to a project or a project entity
that is outside the normal scope of an audit. Any such matters thiat may
be requested by the Bank may be included in the terms of reference of
auditors".



- 22 -
virtually inconceivable. On that basis the banks were acceptable Bank
borrowers.  The Bank's appraisals of IC II and IC III/IV echoed these views.
At that time - the years between l074-1978 - the position taken by the Bank
was praguatic and acceptable. However, it was understood that tLis position
was only transitional, until "conventional" assessment of creditworthiness
became possible.
69.      Under IC II, III and IV, the expectation was that the banks would
remain in a sound financial position, although no attempt could be made to
define what that should be deemed to be. No capital structure (debt/equity
ratio) or other specific financial covenants were included the Loan
Agreements. In the condition, found in most DFC loan agreements, about the
borrower's undertaking to carry out the project "with due diligence and
efficiency", the customary reference to "appropriate financial standards and
practices" could not be included. The difficulty lay in agreeing on what
"appropriate" or "sound" should be taken to mean, in the Yugoslav context.
There are, consequently, no clear reference points against which to judge how
the banks have performed financially. Some aspects of this question are
d .scussed below.
Capital Structure
70.      The total debt/equity ratio for the banks has evolved as follows:
Table 8: Debt/Eq.uity Ratios /a
1974          1977         1980       1984
IBT                11.0          11.7         17.0        41.3
KBP                10.7          13.5         11.2        15.1
PBS                 5.8           8.2         11.5        29.6
SBS                 7.7           8.3         14.1        13.6
/a    The ratios include debt of any term and all Federal and Republic funds
(which have many of the characteristics of managed funds) on the "debt"
side of the ratio. Ea'iity is defined as funds employed plus
unappropriated income (Annex 0).
Source: IBRD, May 1986.
The table shows that there has been a proportionately dramatic increase of
debt, of any kind, in IBT and PBS between 1980 and 1984, while the capital
structures of KBP and SBS remained stable. The reasons for the deterioration
in IBT's and PBS's position are not clear, but insufficient earnings appear to
be one. It may be noted, in this context, that none of the four banks --
reportedly along with the majority of all Yugoslav banks -- satisfies Yugoslav
law with respect to the size of their Reserve Funds (RF' and Joint Liability
Funds (JLF). Eoth are to be built up to and maintained at a level of at least
3Z each of loans and investments made. 27/ Each of SBS's funds are of the

order of 1S; the funds of IBT, KBP and PBS hover around 0.5S, or less (cf.
Table 10).  The new Banking Law (1985) is giving considerably greater
significance to the role of equity, including the institution of owners
limited liability.  New income allocation mechanisms should result in stricter
compliance with the new reserve and provision requirements.  While it is too
early to assess how these objectives will be implemented, they appear as major
improvements in the financial policy of banks.

Operations and Finances
71.      Annex 7 gives, in aunary form, bank-by-bank data on operations,
financial position, resource position, and portfolios, for the three years
1982-1984.  Summarized financial statements, for the year. 1976 through 1984,
are found as Annexes 8 and 9.
Portfolio Position
72.      Table 9 on arrears and their relation to the long-term loan portfolio
has been extracted from the banks' financial statements and SDK's audit
reports.
73.      Except perhaps for IBT, whose long-term arrears amounted to 5.51 of
the portfolio at the end of 1984 (but down from 8.41 at end-1982), the
proportions of actual arrears appear at face value satisfactory. As to the
portion of the portfolio affected, PBS and SBS, both approaching the half-mark,
are apparently more exposed than the other two. However, although only 311 of
IBT's portfolio is classified as affected (and the percentage has constantly
declined since 1979), the constellation of high actual arrears applying to a
smaller portion of the portfolio can mean that arrears on individual accounts
are proportionally higher than for the other banks, and may be potentially
more serious. Data are not available to allow more specific conclusions. For
all four banks, the absence of broadly categorized information represents a
serious handicap to a real assessment of their overall quality and position in
financial terms. 28/ Such data might, in the future, be added to the SDK
analys,s of arrears in its audit reports (para 65).
74.      According to SDK audit reports, the relationship between the
arrears-affected portfolio and reserves and provisions is as follows:

281 PBS is of the opinion that "the financial position of the borrowers has
not gotten worse despite big problems being faced by the economy" (Annex
10. para 3).



- 25 -
75.      It would appear from this that PBS and SBS are better covered against
potential losses than IBT and KBP. However, none of the banks are in a atrong
position. 29/ A cushion of reserves and provisions in the range of 2.6X-7.8%
of the troublesome portfolio portion is a very weak one, by most assessments.
The position of IBT and KBP is cause for special concern, especially when, as
now, the economy is in a downbeat and an increasing number of enterprises are
facing serious difficulties. It is to be hoped that, under the 1985 banking
law (Annex 1), the measures will be applied to strengthen significantly the
financial position of all four banks. From the Bank's side, the matter needs
continued close watching.
Foreign Exchange Losses
76.      The banks have, over a number of yee.rs, incurred substantial foreign
exchange losses, so far not fLlly provided for, because of the strong erosion
in the value of the dinar. Some losses arose on foreign currency savings
accounts, but the NBY eventually took over the accounts and attendant risks
and losses.  Other losses have arisen through the failure of enterprises under
financial duress to meet their foreign currency obligations, which then fell
on the banks to service. Federal regulations permit the ensuing losses to be
amortized over 15 years.  In the meanwhile, they appear as a serious distortion
of the balance sheet picture.
VII. ASPECTS OF THE BORROWER/LENDER RELATIONSHIP
77.      i'rom the time of the appraisal, in 1973/74, of the First Industrial
Credit Pro5jett, it was clear to the Bank that its relationship with the four
borr-ower baL2ks would in several ways take on a character different from tthat
of the then usual DFC Bank/borrower relationships.  The latter were
"holistic", ini the sense that the Bank, in its wish to contribute in thel!
tullest possible measure to the institution's overall development, would
typically agree on policies, measures and procedures whereby it would not ;:nl.y
be faily informed of, but could also have an influence on, essential matters
of policy, management and practice of some significance to the DFC concerned.
This type of relationship worked well in cases where the Bank, as a creditor
and technical collaborator, was a very large or predominant, partner in
busiiles. to the DFC.
78.      In Yugoslavia, that was not the case.  In  1973, the combined total
asset  of rthe four banks ran about US$5 billion equivalent; the Loan
discussed, and eventually approved, was US$50 million, or 1X. Even in the
context of the understanding that this was only to be the first of a series of
similar operations, this support was considered by the banks as marginal.
Consequently, the Bank's role became for the most part confined to those
aspects of thle banks' policies, procedures, operations and finances that 6ure
directly on their use of Bank funds. It was hoped that, over time and witl3out
formal tunderstanding or legal commitment, the banks would recognize the mlleri.ts
291 PBS feels that reserves are adequate, adding that the situation will
f ;.ther improve by the application of the new Banking Law, which requ.i'es
1-'mptilsory graduated increase in reserves (Annex 10, para 17).

of such matters as full economic and financial appraisals, disbursements,
project supervision, and external audits, and would gradually and
progressively let these become the standards for their overall activities.
79.      These expectations were only partially to come true.  One oL the
earliest and most persistent problems became one of simply obtaining, from the
banks, information and data in such form and detail as the Bank considered
necessary for it to carry out even its more limited role. 3Q/ The banks were
especially reluctant to pass on details about the status of their portfolios,
deficient loan service, reachedulings, probable losses, provisions and
write-offs, claiming that they would thereby violate the standards of
confidentiality expected of bankers. The issue was discussed during IC II
Loan negotiations, in April 1976. 31/ However, the problem remained a ser'.ous
one over the past twelve years. When the PCR mission visited the banks in May
1986, two of them declined to furnish requested arrears and rescheduling data
concerning Bank sub-borrowers under IC II, III and IV, and the data received
from the other two banks was limited.
80.      Another deep-rooted and enduring problem seems to have been the lack
of real conviction, on the part of the Yugoslav banks, that the Bank's
approach to such fundamental matters as project appraisal and supervision
represented any real improvement over their own past practices and, hence, a
tendency towards a "minimalist" fulfillment, on their part, of agreements and
understandings with the Bank in these respects. This attitude has perhaps
been most apparent with regard to project supervision. The banks, by their
own statement, 32/ developed a conception of the Bank as being formalistic and
rigid in its requirements, and, in fact, placing form over substance. 33/
This is an observation that deserves to be taken seriously.  However, it does
not dissociate high-quality project appraisal and supervision, on the one
30/ PBS menLions that the reporting requirements under the Industrial Credits
are complied with, and reports submitted with reasonable regularity (Annex
10, para 18).
31/ The minutes of negotiations, para. 4, state: "There was some concern, on
the part of the Borrowers, that [giving out data pertaining to the
Borrowers' loan portfolio which the Bank considered essential for
portfolio evaluation] might require them to divulge confidential business
secrets. Following clarification by the Bank, the Borrowers gave their
assurance that information reasonably requested by the Bank including
those relating to the structure of the loan portfolio and arrearu. Logether
with the reschedulings would be made available."

Credit Project.

have been achieved in respect of the number of jobs, larger export
orientation, coverage of a larger number of subprojects, which is very
positive, but these positive features are belittled by pointing out the
insufficient results in respect of making the borrowers more :;apahbe for a
better quality appraisal and supervision work on the projects."

hand, and good investment results, on the other hand.
81.      Underlying the problems faced by these Credits was the magnitude of
the tak of supervising in adequate depth and scope a series of Industrial
Credits spread amongst four banks in four regions of de-centralized economic
decision-making, each one highly individualistic and independent in its views
and practices, working in an economic/financial system unique unto itself and
quite different from any others to which the Bank's staff were accustomed,
necessitating translations, not just of all words spoken and written from one
language into another, but also of financial and economic data from one way of
presentation into another, to be understood and be meaningful. Because of the
magnitude of the supervision effort required, the Bank may have devoted
insufficient budgetary resources to the task of Industrial Credit's
supervision.
82.      Supervision missions visited each bank borrower -- based on
statistics covering 1978 through early 1986 -- approximately once every 9 or
10 months, on average, and then the mission would spend, typically, three or
four days, with each bank. Resources, allocated by the Bank, were perhaps too
small for what were, in fact several -- two to four - projects. The alloted
time was not enough for any in-depth discussions, subproject visits, issue
analysis and resolution, and detailed work on procedural improvements and
issues. Several factors compounded the time problem and weakened the Bank's
supervision efforts. The first, and most serious, impediment was the banks'
inability to submit meaningful data on their portfolio. Second, was the
language problem. 34/ Very few, even amongst the relatively young and
well-educated Yugoslav staff counterparts, speak a foreign larnguage of
international usage (such as English), hence, all verbal communication has to
go through interpreters. Third, information systems in the banks have, as a
general rule, not yet been well developed (cf. paras 61-62) s0 that data
required were often slow in preparation and then needed careful verification
for reliability. Finally, however strenuous the supervision efforts might
have been, those efforts would have been brought to naught without the banks'
active cooperation, particularly on matters of data submission, an area in
which banks have proved intransigent.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
83.      From the start of project preparation and appraisal of the Bank's
First Industrial Credit Project for Yugoslav LDRs, in 1973, almost 13 years of
interaction have gone by. The Bank and its counterparts in Yugoslav4a have
come to know one another well and, although communication between therm is
34/ PBS states that obligations have always been fulfilled although not always
upon agreed terms. PBS' information sysLem does not produce the required
data, and particular difficulties have been experienced with projections
when specific features of the planning system are taken into considera-
tion. PBS adds that "In some cases different departments of the World
Bank have requested for the submission of data for the same purposes
without having been previously reconciled in the World Bank." (Annex 10,
para 4).

uneven, there is now at least a usually clear understanding of attitudes and
intentions, practices and modus operandi, on both sides. This in itself is
progress, not to be underestimated, over the situation in the years between
1975-1978 when IC II, III and IV were prepared and negotiated. In addition,
about 852 of the aggregate funds of these Loans had been disbursed about three
years ago, and fuill disbursement was completed more than two years ago. The
stage appears well set therefore for a review from which conclusions can be
drawn and lessons learned for the future.
84.      Measured by their appraisal standards, the three Industrial Credit
Projects under review (II, III and IV) have had mixed success. On the
positive side, they have infused foreign exchange funds to apparently good use
in a number of predominantly small and medium scale enterprises. They have
also helped in fostering attention in the merits of the projects themselves,
as best they can be determined through an objective, unfettered assessment, as
distinct from more general sectoral policy objectives and the setting of
authoritative priorities. They have addressed the unemployment problem by
focusing on job creation at low cost. They have facilitated the mobilization
of supplementary foreign exchange resources for some enterprises, and have
helped to instill a keener appreciation of the importance of clear and
:onsistently applied accounting and auditing processes.
85.      On the other hand, the Projects have not achieved fully yet the major
objectives they had on building stronger institutions, in terms of their
appraisdl and supervision standards and practices, fiaancial capability,
management information systems, and availability and reliability of data
required for the monitoring and continual re-evaluation process. In the
Yugoslav context, this comprehensive approach towards institution building
may, in retrospect, have been overly ambitious, and a narrower, more focussed
approach would have improved the chances of success.
86.      The Bank itself must accept a measure of responsibility for these
unsatisfactory aspects if performance and relationships.  It has been too
flexible in accepting departures from loan agreements and understandings on
receiving necessary information. In the absence of the requisite data base,
the Bank's supervision inevitably lacked depth and thoroughness.
87.      It is nevertheless very encouraging to recognize since 1983 (in
concordance with the first SAL) major changes in the Yugoslav approach to the
role of the financial institutions. These changes, which have culminated in
1985 in the forming of the new Banking Law, have no doubt been inspired in
part by the discussion between the Yugoslav authorities and the Bank.
Relevant though this new law may be, it will be on its impact that assessment
would need to be made, and this assessment will have to be deferred for one or
two years until the full effects of the new law come to light.
88.      Several, and interesting, lessons can be drawn from the Bank's varied
experience with IC II, III and IV:
a.   While minor facets of institutional direction can be influenced at
the individual bank level, larger issues should be raised, and
agreement reached, with the Federal authorities to lay down
appropriate regulations.



- 29 -
b. A sharply deteriorating economic environment inevitably affects banks
adversely and, in recognition thereof, banks should concentrate on
strong project supervision and a substantial build-up of reserves and
provisions.
co   In a socio-nolitical atmosphere, with whose nuances the Bank was
unfamiliar at the time of these ICs, a less ambitious and a narrower,
more focussed approach to institution building, than attempting to
address the full gamut of institutional activities in these early
ICs, would have improved the chances of success.
d.   More vigorous Bank supervision, based on adequate data, supplied
through Bank insistence, would have exposed portfolio problems more
clearly and, relative thereto, the banks' financial condition,
leading towards corrective action.

YUGOSLAVIA: INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECTS II, III & IV
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Yugoslavia - New Banking Law
A law (Law on the Bases of the Banking and Credit System), involving
far-reaching changes in the structure of banks, was passed by the SFRY
assembly on December 20, 1985. The more important elements of the draft law,
with ancillary comments, are given below:
1.   Internal, basic and associated banks will continue to constitute the
banking system but specialized basic banks, e.g. for individuals, for
SSIs, etc. are permitted.
2.   Bank membership is acquired, not only by signing the self-management
agreement on establishment of the banks, but also by investing
resources in the banks' reserves, i.e. the Joint Liability Fund (JLF)
for covering losses and the Reserve Fund (RF) to protect liquidity.
Basic and other organizations of associated labor and other social
juridicial entities, with the exception of socio-political
communities; may be members of a bank. Members may withdraw or
transfer their initial contribution (share) of JLF-RF plus subsequent
additions thereto, should they decide to leave the bank.
3.   An organization of associated labor may be a member of more than one
basic bank and a basic bank may also be a member of more than one
associated bank.
4.   The self-management agreement (the bank's charter) may prescribe that
members be liable only up to their respective levels of resources
invested in the bank, or up to the amounts stated in the accord.
Comments on Items 1-4:  The unlimited liability assuned by member enterprises
will be exchanged for a limited liability structure. If an analogy is drawvn
with a western-style bank, the contributions made by member enterptises into
the bank's ft'.ids is the equivalent of share capital and that amount, unless
otherwise provided for in the bank's self-management agreement, represents the
sum of members' liability. Even if additional liability is stipulated for
members in the self-management agreement, their liability remains limited to a
defined level. Also, contributions may be wichdrawn or transferred; in the
event of transfer, there would probably be some financial consideration,
making it somewhat akin to sale and purchase of shares. A further factor is
that an enterprise could be a member (shareholder) in more than one bank which
should introduce competition among banks for good clients.

Annex I

5.   To continue business, a basic Bank's funds and dinar time deposits
shall amount to Dinar 6 billion.
Comments on Item 5:  This stipulation will involve major changes in the
structure of banks. Small banks will be merged into larger units, a healthy
development both in terms of potential management caliber and costs. The
number of basic banks are expected to contract from 160 to 60-80 banks.
6.   Social monitoring of banks is to be exercised by the assemblies of
republics/provinces, and audit by the Social Accounting Service
(SDK). As a cordition of establishment, the local national bank
verifies that the bank's operational criteria conform to those set
out by the National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY). Similarly, NBY checks
the status (financial condition, et al) of the bank for conducting
foreign exchange transactions.
7.   A bank may not commit more than 10 percent of its liquid investment
potential to a single borrower but this limit could be relaxed to 25
percent with the sanction of the bank's assembly. This formula links
the size of loans with the size of banks and eventually, as a means
for larger loans, makes for larger banks.
Comments on Items 6 and 7: The social monitoring o, banks by the assemblies
oJ. republics/provinces and audit by SDK are important since they would
supervise the actual banking and investment practices.  On Item 7, the
loan/resource ratio will clearly give an added impetus towards bank mergers as
major enterprises would favor large banks, as a means towards larger loans.
It is believed that the 25% upper limit would be used infrequently, banks
preferring, when necessary, consortium lending for which provision has been
made in the law.
8.   Operating surplus will be divided among members according to their
respective contribution (share), but after charging for JLF-RF and
other funds as decided by the assembly, or as laid down in the
self-management agreement.
9.   The JLF-RF will accrue from members' contributions plus
appropriations from income earned. JLF and RF will amount to 5% each
of portfolio and would reach the 5% level by an increase of 1%
annually.
Comments on Items 8 and 9:  The current serious issue of inadequate reserves
could largely be met by these revisions, particularly as special reserves (and
provisions) may, as necessary, also be create.. 't now becomes possible for
banks to have a proper level of financial reserves, with any surplus
distributed only after attaining the targeted level.

10..  The assembly, executive board and credit committee will be drawn from
the banks' members.  The position remains the same as before.
11. Banks would be required to make a professional evaluation of the
economic justifications of investment projects. Founders would
"'commit themselves" to sound criteria in making loars.
12. A loan applicant is creditworthy provided he is not in arrears.
13.  Banks are required to monitor, through the instrument of an
agreement, the effects of completed investment projects financed by
credits.
Comments on Items 10-13: Much emphasis has been placed on the need for banks
to make sound, economically justified, investments. With high risk or
inadequately appraised investments leading to losses and the consequent danger
of bank liquidation (see item 15 below), bank management--assembly, executive
board and credit committee---although drawn from member enterprises, would tend
to exercise prudence. Nevertheless, bank management control by member
enterprise remains a weak facet. The supervision function, largely neglected
by banks in the past, has now been placed in the law, giving this task a
serious intent.
14. If a bank is illiquid, a series of rescue operations are mounted
involving the local national bank, NBY, the republican/provincial
government, and finally the SFRY assembly.
15.  If operating losses are incurred and cannot be covered by JLF, the
bank assembly will decide on the means to cover the loss, which in
any event must be covered within one year; failing which, the bank
will cease operations, but- could be rescued by decision of SFRY
assembly.
Comments on Items 14 and 15:  In the law, liquidity has been dealt with at
some length, since Yugoslav banks, particularly in LDRs, tend to suffer from
liquidity mismanagement fairly frequently.  The arrangements to overcome
problems in this area are comprehensive. On bank insolvency, the measures
proposed are clear atid firm. They require that losses be covered within 12
months. The serioui doubts surrounding foreign exchange losses that have
afflicted banks over the past five years would also be resolved: they too must
be covered within the subsequent year. This particular clause calls for a far
greater measure of financial discipline on the part of bank management than
has been exercised in the past.

Operations
1.   IBT's commitments of long-term and short term loans for 1982-1984 are
summarized below:
Table 1: IBT Long- and Short-Term Cdmmitments, 1982-84
(in Billions)
1982                1983                1984
Dinars      US$      Dinars    US$       Dinars    uS$
Long-term Loans                 15.96       0.32     12.73      0.144    4.9        0.03
Short-term Loans                 7.97       0.16      7.30      0.08      2.L       0.01
Exchange rate Dinar/$                50.28                92.84                152.82
2.  Most short-term loans are revolving credits with maturities of up to one
year to provide workcing capital to enterprises and are made by basic banks.
IBT's commitments of short-term loans (in dinar terms) in 1984 are about
one-third of short-term loans in 1982.  The long-term loans are normally for
capital expenditures and have maturities of over 7 years. IBT's commitments
of long-term loans declined substantially in 1984 with respect to 1982, by as
much as 752. The poor economic conditions in 1984 had led to wi:adrawai of
many projects from IBT's pipeline and postponement of investment decisions by
investors in general.

p.a. to reach Dinar 134.6 billion ($881 million). The short-term deposits of
IBT increased by about 412 p.a. to reach Dinar 10.5 billion ($68.7 million).
IBT's net income after taxes increased from Dinar 272 million ($5.4 million)
in 1982 to almost Dinar 584 million ($3.8 million) in 1984 which is low and
represents 0.22 of total assets.
4. Resource Position: The total outstanding resources of IBT increased by
about 2.8 times from 1982 to 1984. IBT's largest resource was foreign and
local borrowings and accounted for about 762 of the total outstanding
long-term resources of IBT. IBT's foreign borrowings accounted for 46% of the
total outstanding long-term resources of IBT. The availability of substantial
amount of fund for disbursements by the end of 1984 is an indicative of poor
investment climate in the Republic of Montenegro.
5. Portfolio: During 1982-1984, the long-term portfolio increased from Dinar
71.3 billion ($1.42 billion) to Dinar 174.7 billion ($1.14 billion). Loans to
enterprises for capital investments makes up 751 of IBT's portfolio.
Long-term loans are generally for periods up to 20 years and are normally for
capital investment projects. The arrears situation has been improving slowly
between 1982 to 1984. Long-term loans affected by arrears of more than i
months stayed below 42% by the end of 1984. The arrears situation improved
largely by rescheduling of Dinar 3 billion from 18 enterprises in serious
difficulty as well as stronger debt collection efforts and increase in penalty
interest from 35X (1983) to 622 (1984), levied on delay payments. The 18
enterprises in difficulty are mainly in the industrial (aluminum and steel
works) and in agricultural (agrokombinat) sectors. The collection of
principal and interest in 1983 was over 100% each and in 1984 was between 85%
and 95%. The Reserve Fund and the Joint Liability Fund continued to be far
below the 3% levels each required by the law (0.45 and 0.44% respectively at
the end of 1984). The JLF was also below the level agreed with the Bank under
IC VII. This problem is being addressed by the new banking law which empowers
the management of banks to have a better control of its pay-outs to
shareholders (basic banks and enterprises). The foreign exchange losses
decreased from Dinar 9.3 billion at the end of 1983 to Dinar 7.9 billion at
the end of 1984.

are shown below:

7. Long-term Loans. Commitments of long-term loans increased by 122% in 1983
and fell by 13% in 1984. The 1984 drop was more significant in US dollar
terms, due to inflation, particularly in the coal and energy sector which
declined from 43% of long-term conmitments in 1983 to 6% in 1984.
8. Short-term Loans. Short-term loans outstanding in Dinars increased by 28%
in 1983 and by 18% in 1984. In real terms, the drop was significant in both
years.
9. Guarantees. Outstanding guarantees, including letters of credit increased
from Din. 27.2 billion in 1982 to Din. 44.7 billion in 1983 and Din. 55.7
billion in 1984.
KBP's Financial Situation
10. Fknancial Position. KBP's total assets increased from Dinar 187.1 billion
in 1982 to 'Dinar 401.4 billion in 1984, or an average of 46% p.a. Most of the
growth came from increased long-term loans outstanding.  Funds employed
(reserves) have not been able to keep pace with assets, and in ;984 declined
to 1.0% of assets from 1.5 % in 1982, an u,satisfactory feature. Long-term
loans are covered by term borrowings and savings and time deposits. About 42%
of the long-term borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies (of which
17% from the World Bank and IFC). Domestic borrowings are mainly from the
Federal Fund for the Less Developed Regions, and repayments have recently been
automatically rescheduled. KBP's net income increased from Dirar 105 million
in 1982 to Dinar 555 nillion in 1984, which is still low and only represents
0.14% of total assets. Furthermore, in 1984 KBP deferred foreign exchange
losses of Dinar 779 million, higher than the reported net profit of the year.

11. Portfolio. During 1982-84, the long-term loan portfolio increased from
Dinar 98.2 billion to Dinar 223.2 billi.on. More than 8d% o. these loans were
for capital investments. The increase is partly due to the ti.anslation to
Dinars of loans denominated in !oreign currency.  In US dollar equivalent, the
long-term portfolio declined from $1,953 million to $i,461 million. The
principal affected by arrears increased from Dinar 33.6 billion in 1982 to
Dinar 68.6 billion in 1984; this represents t slight decline from 32.1% to
30.72 of the portfolio outstanding. Principal in arrears (including arrears
of less than 3 months) also declined in relative terms ftom 4.7% to 3.82 of
the portfolio; much of this, however, is due to loans financed from Federal
Funds that have been rescheduled. The rate of collection if interest due from
clients improved from 472 in 1982 to 591 in 1984, but to7ai interest in
arrears increased from Dinar 10.7 billion in 1982 to Dinar 25.6 billion in
1984.

13. Long-term Loans. In dollar terms, long-term lceL1.a were halved in the
1982-84 period although, in dinars, !.oans increased by 50X, due to inflation.
A combination of high ioterest rate& and NBY credic caiiings h:i&e
significantly curbed investment activity. During 1983--84, ,0% of total
investments went to the energy sectcr, 20% for agriculture and forestry,
followed by 141 for me.:aJ industry. Food processing (including tobacco) is
also important, 6% of investnien.s.

working capital purposes, is much less than long-termi lcans, which are
channelled into Investment.

15. Financial Position.  Total assets increased in 1982-84 from Dinars 366
billion ($7.3 billion) to Dinars 856 billion ($5.6 billion) or 134%; in real
terms, the decline in assets is sharp (30%). Funds employed (however) have
declited even faster from 2.0% of total assets to 1.3% in this same period.
Deferred foreign exchange losses have nearly tripled and, at end 1984,
amounted to Dinars 20 billion compared to resources of Dinars 800 billion.
Long-term deposits and borrowings of Dinars 409 billion are substantially
larger than term lending and investments, amounting to Dinars 326 billion.
About one-third of long-term borrowings are derived from foreign currency
loans, the exchange rates being borne by the client enterprises. Net income
inrreased by 200%, significantly faster than the growth of assets but as a
result of substantial distribution of income to members, allocation to
reserves has been inadequate.
Resource Positi)n
16. Of total 1984 resources, 65% were foreign.  The baik's contribution was
9%. SBS's forei3n resources, apart from Bank loans, are derLved from debt
rescheduling of foreign commercial bank lending. The 1983-84 maturities were
consolidated, and made repayable over 3-4 years. The 1985-88 maturities nave
also been agreed for multiannual rescheduling. The Federal and Republic
Development Funds, amounting to 20% of total resources, contributed the
largest domestic component; Bosnia-Herzegovina received 34. of this
development fund.
Portlolio
17. The long-term portfolio has doubled over the 1982-84 perLod and, at end
1984, stood at Dinars 319 billion. Loans to enterprises for capital
investment makes up 75% of PBS portfolio, foreign currency loans 457. Loan
terms are generally for periods up to 20 years, but the average is around 12
years. The portfolio is widely spread between energy, industry, agriculture,
and infrastructure projects, but it is estimated that energy and industry take
up 80% of total portfolio. Arrears have declined from 3.2% of total portfolio
in-1983 to 2.4% in 1984. Particulars of rescheduled loans are not known.

Operations
18. SBS loans commitments, short- and long-term, are set out below:
Table 4_ SBS Long- and Short-Term Loan Commitments, 1982-84
(in Billions)
1982             1983              1984
Dinars    US$   Dinars    US$   Dinars   US$
Long-term Loans                       24.74    0.49   18.59    0.20   37.14   0.24
Short-term Loans                       8.74    0.17   28.06    0.30   62.15   0.41
TOTAL:                           33.48            46.65             99.29
Exchange rate Dinar/$                       50.28             92.84           152.82
19. Long-term Loans.  In dinar terms, long-term loans declined sharply, by
25%, in 1983 compared to 1982 but doubled in 1984 as a result of mounting
inflation.  Loans, in dollar terms, have been halved in the 1982-84 period.
The heavy demand experienced by banks in the 1970s has abated because of.
higher interest rates, foreign exchange risk due to the falling dinar value,
and credit ceilings imposed by the National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY) in
consonance with the IMF. Loan commitments to the industrial sector constitute
40% of the total; commitments for energy financing alone take up another 40X.
Since 1982, SBS has channelled most of its industrial lending to the priority
export sector which includes textiles and wood products. As a result, loan
commitments for textiles have increased four-fold since 1982, wood products
have tripled and machinery doubled. During 1983 and 1984, long-term
commitments havE not kept pace with inflation.
20. Short-term Loans. Most short-term loans finance enterprises' working
capital through 3-month credits. This category is affected by inflation as
well as by tha credit ceilings. Compared to 1981, loans in 1984 in dinars,
increased by 330X; and when compared to 1983, by 120Z. In dollar terms, the
1982-84 situation showed a 141% increase.
21. Guarantees. A miscellaneous variety o; enterprises' needs are satisfied
by guarantees, e.g. letters of credit guarantees, suppliers' credits,
performance and bid bonds, etc. SBS secures full cover through counter-
guarantees in all cases. 1984 amounted to Dinars 183 billion compared to
Dinars 115 billion in 1983; in relation to total assets, guarantees at 35%
resain the same in both years. The increase is due to devaluation, resulting



- 58 -
ANNEX 7
Page 7 of 8
in higher dinar amounts for foreign currency guarantees, which have fallen
from $13 million in 1983 to $8 million in 1984.
22. Financial Position. As a consequence of inflation, total aqsets, as shown
by SBS's balance sheet, increased from Dinars 223.8 billion ($4.5 billion) in
1982 to Dinars 513.6 billion ($3.4 billion) in 1984 or 1302 per annum, but a
steep 32S decline in real terms. Funds employed (reserves) have not been able
to keep pace with assets, and in 1984 declined to 1.82 of assets from 2.82 in
1982, an unsatisfactory feature. Long-term loans of Dinars 230.3 billion are
covered by term borrowings and deposits of Dinars 281.6 biilion. SBS takes a
cautious view of the foreign exchange risk on borrowings, with client
enterprises always bearing this risk. Foreign currency deposits, 30% of total
deposits, are either redeposited with the NBY, which then carries the exchange
risk, or are held by correspondent banks abroad. Of long- and short-term
loans, 822 are granted to enterprises; of long-term loans alone, nearly 802
are for fixed assets acquisition. In-1982-84, long-term portfolio declined to
452 of assets from 582, a small reduction in portfolio risk. On the income
side, SBS has not evolved a consistent approach towards its spread 1/ which
has fluctuated between 3% and 6% during 1982-84; in 1984, the spread was 3%
compared to 6% in 1983 and 4% in 1982. For the future, a tore consistent
approach will be required by SBS.
Resource Position
23. Over 552 of total 1984 resources were foreign; the Bank's contribution was
i6%. Apart from Bank loans, SBS foreign resources are derived from
rescheduling of foreign debt. The 1983 and 1984 maturities of
foreign borrowings have been consolidated, and are now repayable over 3-4
years. The 1985-88 maturities have been agreed for multiannual rescheduling.
Federal and Republic Development Funds were the largest domestic component.
This fund is financed by contributions from Yugoslav enterprises and divided
amongst the less developed repuolics, Macedonia's 1984 share being 24%. With
a term of 14'years and interest rate up to 8.02, this is a large, low-cost
resource for Macedonia and SBS. Long-term deposits are increasingly financing
long-term lending, 422 in 1984, up from 32% in 1982.
Portfolio
24. During 1982-84, the long-term loan portfolio increased from Dinars 158
billion to Dinars 306 billion, 742 representing loans to enterprises for
capital investment, 442 foreign currency loans. Loan terms are generally for
periods up to 20 years, but the average is in the range of 10-13 years. The
portfolio is widely spread between energy, industry, agriculture, and
infrastructure projects.
1/ Spresd is defined as the difference between return on average outstanding
loans and the cost of average total debt including deposits.

ANNEX 7
Page 8 of 8
25. Arrears show a declining trend; arrears over 3 months amounted to 3.4X of
portfolio in 1984, 4.11 in 1982. But this occurs after Dinars 22 billion are
shifted from portfolio to doubtful loans, implying that 8.4S of SBS's
portfolio faces serious difficulties. This doubtful component relates mainly
to a ferro-nickel project, considered a total fiasco, now mothballed and
unlikely to recomence operations, The obligation for about one-third of the
loans for this project has been assumed by the Republican Government and SBS
takes the position that the remaining portion will also be taken over by
Government, it being only a matter of time. However, doubtful loans are so
large, nine times S3S' utilizable reserves, that until the issue is clarified,
its portfolio should be taken to be of uncertain quality.

Dear Mr. Thomas,
We have received your letter dated August 13,1986 with considerable
delay,attached to which we received a Draft of the Project
Completion Report.However, the analysis and giving of our
comments to such a Draft Report required engagement of certain
aumber of organizational units within Frivredna Banka Sarajevo,
Udruzena Banka as well as some consulting and additional investi-
gation with the investors,all of which took consideraDle
portion of time.In addition,the Report had to be translated in
Serbo-Croatibn.Therefor,taking into regard the above said
circumstances,you would understand we were not able to furnish
you with our comments and final opinion regarding this Draft
Report upon required term (September 12,1986).
We would likp to point out that certain difficulties occured in
organizing the visit,work and discussions in PBS-UB for
Mr. Einar Sexe,since ei.s visit was coincidental with a visit
of lMr. Sunit Gupta being a member of the Supervision Mission
for the VI Industrial Credit ProJect.Both your officers
had. discussiorA with the same staff of PBS-UB on cumpletely
different issues. Such difficulties were particularly evident
during their field visit to the sub-projects.PBS-UB had informed
the World Bt<ac about thiac problem before Mr. Sexe's bcrival
to Sarajevo.

Another difficulty was that on April 24, 1986 there had been
organized in Sarajevo the discussions of the group of Board members
with the P1resident of the Republic Executive Council, and there were
also present the representatives of PBS-Udruzena Banka that should
have also meet Mr. Sexe in order to discuss some specific issues.
.General impression resul4;ing out of the relevant Draft Report is
that, with respect to the credit objectives, much more importance
is attached to the institutional objectives and not to objectives
of more rapid development and increase in employpent in less develop-
ed regions of Yugoslavia, which are actually preferential credit
objectives being stipulated by the loan agreements. However, in the
Draft there is just a shy hint about satisfactory results beinL
achieved in that field of our activity, althouf-rh we think that
certain -ood results have been achieved. This particularly refers
to the efficient utilization of funds, which practicaly hiave been
utilized more quickly in relation to the projections, particularly
when coTpared to ocher IBRD loans /agriculture, road construction,
enerry, etc./ Normally, certain difficulties have been beinr- faced
during' completion of the sub-projects. However, we should emphasize
that, withir. very short period of time, projected production results
have been achieved by almost all investors, which also includes
economic -and f'inancial results despite rather bad conditions
prevailinE in the country as well as abroad in relation to the
projected ones. Very few investors have been facing major
difficulties, and none of them has been facing unsolvable ones.
This reflects proper and good sub-projects selection, as well as
the quality attached to the sub-projects appraisal, althouFh
appraisal methodology required by the World Bank has not been
strlctly applied to all cases. In cennection therewith, we would
like to draw your attention to our comments and opinion riven to
the Draft Report for the I Industrial Credit Project beii.g set out
in the letter dated April 24,1984. In that letter there has been
set out a clarification for different accesses in the s5b-projects
appraisal niethodology, as it is normal that one cannot expect
to see the same difficulties being equally met by

various new sub-projects,recostruction sub-projects,small and large
sub-projectstb.tter or worse organized investor3,developed and
less developed regions and similar.Our opinion is that the comments
and opinions disolosed in the above mentioned letter should have
been taken into regard more seriously during preparation of this
Draft Report,which would create more complete and actual Report.
In connection therewith,we v'- should set out here a few comments
given in the letter dated April 24,1984.
Our comments are the following:
1. Conclusion given under (ii) "Highlights" stating that 1/3 of
T   In      sub-projects is uncertain or unhealthy does not match with a
lights,     conclusion given in #ection 52.First of all,only 2 sub-projects
ti (i),  are marked as having large difficulties /not being PBS sub-projects
and the conclusion "3/4 of healthy ones,remaining sub-projects
are of uncertain quality,and oaly 2 unhealthy" would be more
convenient to say here.
2. Under (iii) les satisfactory  iastitutional development has
been mentioned out.In the introduction to these comments we
have explained that this issue has been receiving significant
attention,however,more from the point of view of the form
rather than its substance.The fact that good results have been
achieved in credit completion proves proper and good selection
and appraisal of the sub-projects,as well as relatively good
sub-project supervision works,despite the fact that the
methodolog7 required by the World Bank has not been strictly
applied to all sub-projects. We have already pointed out that
it isuiecessaX  to apply  the same methodology to all,
sub-projects,as t R sub-projects themselves have their own
specific features.There must be certain difficulties in
connection with market analysis,particularly when internation&l
market analysis is required.It is rather difficult co project
future developments in domeatic market,as it is objecti.vely
very difficult to obtain necessary data and information.

.3. Under (iv) you say that financial position of borrowers seems
to be poor/bad stating that none of the banKs has obtained
Reflected    funds to cover possible losses. We are of the opinion that such
in pwar. 73,
footnote 28. a conclusion of yours is not fully correct.since the financial
position of the borrowers has not got worse despite big problems
being faced by the economy. It is obvious that high negative
exchange rate differences are serious problem,however it is
a specific problem of Yugoslav economy.With respectto the
obtaining of special reservea to cover possible losses,your
conclusion is correct from the formal point of view,howe-er,
the borrowers really have available considerable reserves,
as well as corected receivables value.For PBS these twnO entries
amount more than 26 billion Dinars in 1985. which makes much
more than all fund resources.
4. Conclusion under (v) is unacceptable,as PBS -Udruzena Banka
Text of     has  always fulfilled its obligations with respect to reporst

of data for the same purposes without having been previously
reconciled in the World Bank.
Specific difficulties have occured with respect to the
projections,particularly when takJ.ng :into regard the specific
features of the planning system in Yugoslav banks.
5. Our opinion is that the conclusion under (vi) regarding
investment objectives should be modified in terms of the
objectives having been well achieved which is reflected by

the statements set out in below text of the Report.We would like
Already     to point out once again that those have been credit objectives
reflected    of high priority and that the institutional building  of

wording of   borrowers has been less important.
Highlights.
item (vi)
6. In section 6. the conclusion about small impact on improvement
in the quality of investment decisions has been repeated.In
Reflected    our letter dated April 24,1984 we pointed out in paragraph 1.
in para. 6   that such a conclusion was inconvenient and that the issues
by cross-
referer.ce    being incorporated into it should be a major task of Yugoslav
to para. 56  business banks.We also said that we could not understand the
and foot-
note 3     basis of the conclusion that the reorganization in the banking
system affected the independent investment decision making.
Business banks were,with respect to investment decision making,
independent and repoasible,however,such a responsibility was
much more emphasized in the new Law on banking and credit system.
We think that those conclusions should be dodified or better
clarified.It is pointed out once again in this section that
the application of "healthy methods" is one of the major
objectives for approval of these loans. Despite that fact,
we wish to mention out that increase in export,employment and
similar economic elements are the investment objectives of
high priority.
7. In section 13. it has been mentioned out once again that
Reflected    these loans have been mainly realized with favourable results,
in para. 13' that does not rflect a real situation,all of which we have
footnote 6
stated in paragraph 5.We would propose to have modified this
conclusion.
83  We consider the conclusion given in section 22. incorrect,
Reflected    as such circumstances have resulted in better utilization of
foonpart 22  the loanaswithout having bad consequences affecting the
sub-projects selection,which is reflected by date. about
sLb-projects themselves.

9. In section 28. there should be particularly pointed out
that big intercurrency changes have resulted,especially with
III and IV ICS ,in major savings during sub-projects completion,
which has secured additional inclusion of other sub-projects ayad
Reflected   slower funds utilization.However,it is just the possibility to
in pars. 28, have additional inclusion of the sub-projects that makes
footnote 13
considerable advantage for their practical full utiliaation,
which is not the ease with other similar loans.As a result of
a refusal to have additional investments with other loans,?BS
was compelled to cancel the utilization of significant portion
of funds.Funds surpluses have occured as a result of unrealistic
estimates and intercurrency changes,which have normally affected
total loan costs/com.fee,front end fee/.
lo.iith respect to high overruns (section 38.)and the conclusion
saying that they reflect very bad appraisal of the sub-projects,
we would like to supply you with additional explanation.
The investments into some other sub-projects have been,in error,
included into total costs of mentioned sub-projects,as it is
Reflected    often the ease that under modernization and capacities expansion
n para. 38  several sub-projects are being carried out within the same
footnote 16
project.Therefore,one could derive a wrong conclusion on the
quality of sub-project appriisal.For an example,4fter
elimination of such costs in sub-project A2 under loan 1612 YU,
overruns amount 135,and in sub-project B13,they are 93.
However,in "he sub-projects having long -term completion with
some long delais,cost overruns are the result of zigh inflation
rate,just as it is the ease with sub-projects B15 and B29.
However,none of the sub-projects have faced overruns in their
portions financed by the World Bank funds.
ll.With respect to FRR and ERR calculations (section 39.) we would
like to point out that these are made on tha basis of data
Deing more complete in relation to data used in sub-projects
appraisal.However,big difficulties have been met when
calculating FRR and ERR as a result of high inflation rate.

Anyhow,derived results should be considered indicative as well.
12.In section 48. there is a statement that PBS has refused to
Reflected   supply data on the arrears.We would like to point out that thexe
in pare. 48, are no arrears under the World Bank loans,therefore one should riot
footnote 18
speak about PBS refusal to supply such a data.
15.We agree withl your opinion regarding market evaluation wiicil
is set out in section 52.However,just as it is said in abpve
text,market evaluation is always acoompanied by major objective
Already    difficulties.It is sufficient to make an analysis of the
reflected   developments in the international markets to come to a

made towards improvement in the 96&ar.et evaluation analysis,

Reflected 15.The conclusion set out in section 56. about the banks being
in Para.    too dependent upon their founders and therefore not being able
56. f oot-
note 21     to give strict appraisal of the sub-projects is incolZrect.
16.In section 73.you have stated that banks are not in poasession
Text 7n      of rescheduling data.However,the banks submit such data to
modified     the World Bank within other regular reports on an annual basis.
17.With respoct to section 75.it has been said that the position
of the banks is weak in relation to suspicious portfolio.
More complete explanation Las been given in paragraph 3 of
Reflected    this letter pointing out that such reserves really exist,being
in para.    required to cover losses under such debts.It is certain that
75,foot-    the situation would  improve by application of new Law on
note 29
banking and credit system providing for some changes with
reapect tv bUenks"status that should secure for the banks to
earn higher income,which is contrary to a former period when
the banks should have earned only as much money as required
to cover their expenditures.
Reflected 18.With respect to section 79. required explanations are given
in para.    in paragraphs 4 and 12 and we wish to point out once again
79, footnote  that-all reports have been being regularly submitted,however
30
with some smal'l reasonable delays.
We think that your Report shoul, have mentioned out that the
cooperation with the World Bank staff contributed to efficient
completion of the lobuns facing certain difficulties that were
surpassed under mutual understanding.
We also think that you, should set out in the Report that
paragraph (f) of the Ilinutes on negotiations for the III and IV
credit projects provriding for utilization of ;he currencies  of
equipment origin country has not been consistently applied.
