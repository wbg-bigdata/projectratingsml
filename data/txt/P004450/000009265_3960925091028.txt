PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
PHILIPPINES
FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1374-PH)
PREFACE
This is a performance audit of the Fourth Education Project in the
Philippines, for which Loan 1374-PH in the amount of US$25.0 million was
approved  in March 1977.   The loan became effective in June  1977, and the
Closing Date was extended once to December 31, 1983.  The last disbursement
was made on .ugust 2, 1984 and an undisbursed Lalance of about T'S$133,000 was
cancelled.
The eudit report consists of a Project Performance Audit Memorandum
(PPAM) prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) and a Project
Completion  Report  (PCR)  dated July  17,  1985.    The  PCR  consists  of  two
chapters:  Chapter I was prepared by the Government with Unesco assistance,
and Chapter II by the East Asia and Pacific Region Education Projects
Division.
The PPAM is based on a review of material in Bank files, including
the Staff Appraisal Report No. 1207c-PH of Februai) 10, 1977; the President's
Report No. P-1997-PH of February 16, 1977; the records of the Board discus-
sion of this project on March I, 1977; the Loan Agreement dated March 25,
1977; correspondence with the Borrower concerning this project, including the
quarterly progress reports; Bank reports on preceding and subsequent
education projects in the Philippines; the PCR, and discussion with Borrower
and Bank staff associated with this project.   Selected project institutions
were visited by an OED mission to tne Philippines in December 1985.
The PCR provides much useful inf rmation which the PPAM supplements
with other 4nformation from Bank records .id with comments on various aspects
of project implementat!on experience.   There is, however, a wide divergence
between the total actual project cost reported by the PCR and that estimated
by the PPAM.   The Operations Evaluation Department gratefully acknowledges
the cordial cooperation accorded the OED mission by the Ministry of
Education, Culture and Sports.
Following customary OED procedures, copies of the draft PCR were
sent to the Government for comment  in April  1986.   No comments have been
received.

million was disbursed and about US$133,000 was cancelled on August 2, 1984
when the loan account was closed.  The actual project cost estimated by this
audit was about $48.5 million, 7% above the appraisal estimate; it differs
greatly from the PCR statement of US$26.4 million (PPAM, paras. 31-32).
Objective
The project's main objecti-es were to increase the supply of well-
qualified agricultural manpower and to improve the quality of agr4cultural
education and training.   To achieve these objectives,  the project provided
buildings, furniture, equipment and technical assistance, as appropriate for
each  component:    (a)  to establish  the Technical  Panel  for Agricultural
Education (TPAE), the Vlsayas State College of Agriculture (VISCA) and the
Philippine Training Centers for Rural Development (PTC-RD); (b) to strengthen
the University of the Philippines at Los Banos (UPLB), more specifically its
College of Forestry (UPLB-CF), Institute of Animal Science (UPLB-IAS), and
College of Veterinary Medicine (UPLB-CVM); and (c) to carry out studies,
including the monitoring and evaluation of the project.
Implementation Experience
The project has achieved a substantial part of its sbjectives. Its
implemdntation, however, was adversely affected by the unexpected price
inflation of 1979-80 and the subsequent devaluation of the peso.  The hard-
ship was compounded by changes in project management just as Inflation hit
the project.   Spiralling  prices of building materials  aaLd labor and  the
absence of price escalation clauses in the original building contracts led
eventually to the cancellation of these contracts.   Renegotiated contracts
were ineffectual. Consequently most of the physical facilities at UPLB were
unfinished at project completion, but construction at VISCA and for the



- vi -
PTC-RD wao successfully completed. The project originally was expected to be
completed by September 30, 1981, or 54 months after loan signing.  Instead,
the project was nominally completed in December 1983, even though several
important buildings were not completed.   The time overrun was 25 months or
46%. Taking physical components aloae, however, the time overrun was 1922.
Results
The results were mixed.  The output of graduates from the project
institutions progressively increased but not to the extent expected at
appraisal.  Most (about 802) of a sample of graduates surveyed were found to
be employei after a job search of three or four months.   Staff development
through the fellowship program was one of the most successful activities: it
exceeded the appraisal plan by nearly 50%, having trained 277 instead of 187
staff at only a 17% cost increase over the appraisal estimate.   The PTC-RD
established a network of regional training centers and farmer training
centers.  As a result of their training programs, farm production increased
significantly, according to a survey.   The Technical Panel for Agricultural
Education, despite budgetary and administrative constraints, formulated
minimum  educational  standards  for  17  undergraduate  and  26  postgraduate
courses and d, ieloped an accreditation system for agricultural education, as
well as a plan for a national system of agricultural education, out the Panel
could not control the enrollment expansion of agricultural educational
institutions because it was not empF,wered to do so.  The outstanding project
achievement is the establishment of VISCA as a regional center of excellence,
second only t. UPLB.
Sustainability
The qustainability of UPLB and VISCA is beyond question as they are
well-established centers of excellence in agricultural education. The future
of the College of Forestry, the Institute of Animal Science, and the College
of Veterinary Medicine at UPLB, however, will depend on the demand for skills
in those areas of specialization, but the fluctuationis in student enrollments
for these colleges can be accommodated within the larger framework of the
University. Regarding extensio' work and farmer training, the PTC-RD appears
well-established, but its efficiency will depend on increases in Government
budgetary support, even though its effectiveness has been demonstrated by
increases in farm production following training provided by the PTC-RD
system.   The TPAE faces the possibility of dissolution after December 31,
1986, when the Government will be released from the Loan Agreement covenant
to maintain it.  Considering the important groundwork the TPAE has achieved
and its usefulness as a consultative and advisory body to the Bureau of
Higher Education, the Government is likely to continue to maintain the Panel
beyond 1986.

Main Findings and Lessons
in addition to the PCR's recommendations from project experience
(PCR, paras. 5.01-'.08; 6.01-6.09), the audit finds that the project has
succeeded in substantially achieving its two major objectives of increasing
the output of agricultural manpower and improving the quality of agricultural
education through the improvement of academic staff qualifica'tions and the
establishment  of VISCA as a regional  center of excellence.   Although thie
total octual output of graduates was about two-thirds of what was projected,
the shortfall was probably a more accurate reflection of the market demand
for trained agricultural manpower and a blessing in disguise in view of the
unamployment  rate  in  the  agricultural  sector.    Other  main  findings  and
lessons are summarized as follows:
(a)  Changes in project management during the life of the projeOL had an
adverse effect on project implementation.   Such changes shoul(i be
avoided but, if unavoidable, adequate measures should be taken to
ensure  that  the  changes  would  not  adversely  affect  project
implementation (PPAM, para. 25; PCR, paras. 5.03, 6.05).
(b)  Most of the staf' of project instituti ris were dissatisfied witn
much of the equipment they received because it was inappropriate or
it could not be used.  To avoid the mismatch between the equipment
and its purpose, end-users should be involved in preparing equip-
ment lists and in inspecting and testing equipment on delivery; the
availability of spare parts and followup service should be taken
into account when equipment is procured; and extra care should be
taken  to ensure  that  the appropriate  space  is provided  for the
equipment (PPAM, para. 26).
(c)  The absence of a price escalation clause in civil werks contrac.s,
ineftective   financial   planning,   and   complicated   budgetary
procedures resulted in the non-completion of important buildings at
UPL3.  In the light of this experience, (i) care should be taKen to
harmonize the project implementation schedule with the Government's
budgetary  procedures  to ensure  a close  link between  the  hudget
cycle and the construction season; and (ii) an adequate price
escalation clause should be built into civil works contracts (PPAM,
para. 27).
(d)  There appears  to be a wide discrepancy be.ween the total actual
pruject cost reported by the PCR and that recorded by the (overn-
nteiut's quarterly progress reports.  As the actual project cost and
the reasons for cost overruns or underruns are important  to the
financial planning and budgetary provisions  for  future  projects,
scrupulous attention should be given to the accounting of project
implementation  funds,  following  the  relevant  guidelines  in  the
Bank's Operational Manual.  It is also suggested that the Internal
Audit Department undertakes a special audit of this project (PPAM,
paras. 31-32).



PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
PHILIPPINES
FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1374-PH)
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
1.        The  Fourth  Education  Project  had  its  origins  in  the  1969
Presidential Commission to Survey Philippine Education whose report in 1970
recommended, among other things, the rationalization and improvement of
agricultural education and training.  Originally conceived as a component of
the Third Education Project (Loan 1224T-PH),1/ agricultural education and
training was deemed sufficiently important to be a self-standing project
which the Bank preappraised in January 1976 and appraised in November 1976.
Following  negotiations  in  Washington  in  January  1977,  the  project  was
presented to the Board on March 1, 1977 and the Loan Agreement was signed on
March 25, 1977. The loan became effective on June 9, 1977.
Agricultural Education and its Role in Agricultural Development
2.        In  the  early  1970s  agriculture  predominated  the  Philippines
economy. It accounted for about 25% of GNP, over 50% of total employment,
and about 75Z of export earnings. Government investment programs, therefore,
emphasized the increased production of staple and commercial crops, livestock
and fisheries, and forest resources and the improvement in extension and
^ther services  to farmers.   The prevailing agricultural  education  system,
however, could not respond effectively to the country's needs.  It produced
graduatts who generally were poorly trained and ill-prepared for productive
employment.    The  ineffective  agricultural  education  and  training  system
could be traced to a number of weaknesses, among which were a shortage of
well-trained teaching staff, inappropriate curricula, and inadequate teaching
and research facilities while student enrollments were increasing rapidly
(from 4,000 in 1964 to 31,000 in 1974) in newly established but generally
poorly endowed agricultural institutions.   At the same time, poorly trained
extension workers led to inadequate farmer extension services. This was the
background to the development of the project which took over two years to
prepare and appraise.
Project Objectives and Scope
3.        The project's main objective was to increase the supply of well-
qualified agricultural manpower to implement important agricultural develop-
ment programs in crops, forestry and livestock (SAR Report No. 1207c-PH,
February 10, 1977, para. 9).  The PCR, however, credits the project with an
additional "main" objective, that of quality improvement in agricultural
1/   An OED audit of this project is being processed.



- 2 -
education and training (PCR, para. 1.08).  While not explicit in the staff
appraisal report, quality improvement was implied in the project scope.  Be
that as it may, the project was designed to support the Government's agricul-
tural education development strategy by (a) establishing and strengthening
three new institutions: the Technical Panel for Agricultural Education
(TPAE), the Visayas State College of Agriculture (VISCA), and a network of
rural training and development headed by the Philippine Training Centers for
Rural Development (PTC-RD); and (b) improving the quality of academic staff
and strengthening teaching and research facilities in the University of the
Philippines at Los Banos (UPLB), specifically the College of Forestry (CF),
the Institute of Animal Science (IAS), and the College of Veterinary Medicine
(PCR, para. 1.08).   Civil works, furniture, equipment and technical assis-
tance were provided for the above project components.
4.        As the trend in the 1970s was to provide backup support to agricul-
tural projects through agricultural education and training programs, it is
useful to set Loan 1374 in a wider background.   Thus, in several respects
this project was a logical development from the First Education Project
(Development Program of the University of the Philippines College of
Agriculture, UPCA), Loan 393-PH, October 1964, and the Second Education
Project,  Credit 349-PH, January 1973.   The major obj%ctives of the First
Education Project were to provide high quality agricultural education and
research and to increase the supply of higher level agricultural manpower for
government service, teaching and public and private research institutions.2/
The Bank's impact evaluation, carried out nine years after project comple-
tion, pointed out that the First Education Project was the Bank's first loan
in the education sector for higher education, and its aim was to achieve a
multiplier effect through the creation of a national center of excellence in
UPCA.   While the project, on the whole, was successful, e., _ ecially UPCA's
extension staff development funded by the Ford and the Rockefeller founda-
tions, the development plan's weakness was tniat it did not adequately prov.de
for the University of the Philippines' continued development through the
establishment of a permanent institutionalized capability for long-term
planning and related programming.3/
5.        The Second Education Project had two of its six major objectives
dealing with agricultural education and training:   (a) training of young
farmers, and (b) training of professional agricultural personnel and improve-
ment of extension services.   For a variety of reasons, the project was not
successful in achieving the objective of training young farmers4/ but was

successful  in  objective  (b)  above  which  involved  the  expansion  and
strengthening of the Regional Agricultural Colleges (RACs) of the Central
Luzon State Universlty (CLSU) and the Central Mindanao University (CMU) to
develop them into regional centers for agriculcural training and research.
6.        The Philippines  First and Second Education Projects had similar
counterparts in the Bangladesh First Education Project (Credit 407-BD, June
1973) and the Agticultural and Rural Training Project (Credit 621-BD, March
1976).  The main objective of Credit 407-BD was to strengthen the Bangladesh
Agricultural University at Mymensingh in teaching, research and extension,
and Credit 621-BD sought to increase agricultural production through more
effective extension, cooperative and credit services  to farmers.5/   These
contemporaneous projects illustrate the importance the Borrowers and the Bank
placed on agricultural education in developing the appropriate skilled man-
power as part of the strategy to increase agricultural production.
Project Cost and Financing Plan
7.        The total project cost, including contingencies, was estimated at
P339.5 million or US$45.3 million equivalent.   The  foreign  exchange was
estimated at P187.5 million or US$25.0 million, representing about 55Z of the
total cost. To meet all the foreign exchange cost, the Bank provided a loan
of US$25.0 million equivalent, repayable over 20 years, including a grace
period of four and a half years, at the interest rate of 8.52 per annum. The
Government would finance  the balance of US$20.3 million equivalent.   The
project, when it was fully operational in 1981, was expected to generate
additional annual recurrent expenditure of about P30.0 million in January
1977 prices.
Implementation Plan
8.        The existing project  unit,  the Educational  Development  Projects
Implementation Task Force (EDPITAF) in the then Ministry of Education and
Culture, would be responsible for the administration, procurement, financial
control and liaison with the Bank in all aspects of the project.  The only
aspect of the project not controlled by EDPITAF would be the teaching
programs of the Philippine Training Centers for Rural Development (PTC-RD)
which would be the responsibility of a National Governing Board Secretariat,
an agency of the Department  of Agriculture.   Within EDPITAF coordinating
committees would ensure that the procurement of civil works, furniture and
equipment would be economically implemented and harmonized with the education
programs.

II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND OJTTCOME
Project Management
9.        EDPITAF had overall respon3ibility for project implementation and
liaison with  the  Bank.    Frequent  organizational  changes  and  high  staff
turnover,   however,   adversely   affected   EDPITAF's   ability   to  address
implementation  problems  effectively.   The separate project  implementation
units (sub-PIUs), established in 1977 in UPLB and VISCA, often could not work
as planned because major decisions on construction and procurement had to be
referred to EDPITAF.   As part of a scheme to decentraliie decision-making,
both UPLB and VISCA in August 1980 took over full responsibility for
implementing all project activities for their own institutions.    From 1982
project maintenance and operating budgets, which until then had been provided
through EDPITAF, were paid to the project institutions through their regular
appropriations.   EDPITAF itself underwent a number of changes, as indicated
by its name change to Foreign-Assisted Projects Office (1982), to Project
Development and Implementation Management Office (1984), and in 1985 back to
it original EDPITAF.   The confusion resulting from these changes caused the
Bandk to draw the Government's attention to the need for a clear delineation
of responsibilities for project implementation (PCR, paras. 2.01-2.03).
Implementation Process
10.       To ensure a rapid start-up and to avoid possible cost overruns due
to initial implementation delays, the Bank had encouraged the Government to
have ready for negotiations architectural sketch plans for all project
institutions and a master plan for VISCA.   In addition, UPLB had advancel
preparation for a 200-manyear fellowship program which, together with the
architectural planning, had retroactive financing of expenditures incurred
after September 1, 1976.
11.       Civil Works Construction.   Overall  construction was expected  to
take about 23 months, from July 1977 to June 1979, as all project sites had
been acquired and surveyed, and schematic designs approved by the Bank.
Tendering by ICB had no major problems, although no foreign firm partici-
pated.   Contract awards, however, experienced an average  four-month delay
after bidding because of tardiness in contract preparation and internal
approval which often required clearance from the President's Office (PCR,
para. 2.04). Total civil works contracts, according to the PCR, amounted to
P128.0 million, about 30% less than the appraisal estimate of P183.0 million,
but the amount covered only contracts made between December 1977 and April
1979, when the last contract (for the Farmers' Training Center in Sab-a,
Leyte), was awarded (PCR, para. 2.04).  From late 1979 to project completion
in December 1983, the project's construction program faced serious problems
due mainly to a rapid price escalation from late 1979 in construction
materials and labor.   The Government's inability to make construction cost
adjustments to the original contracts and the shortage of funds led to a
suspension  of  construction  in  1980.    Temporary  remedial  help  by  the
authorities proved futile.  Five contracts (four in UPLB, one in VISCA) were
cancelled.  Construction work in VISCA was taken over by its Physical Plant



Office, using force account, and UPLB's contracts were retendered as smaller
packages. To complete the project buildings, the Budget Ministry granted an
additional  P50.0 million  (PCR,  paras.  2.05-2.06).   The Closing  Date was
extended from December 1981 to December 1983 to accommodate the project's
extended construction period. By December 1983, according to the PCR (para.
2.07 and Annex 1, Table 1), all project buildings were fully completed and
operational, except those at UPLB which were expected to be completed by
November 1984 (the College of Forestry and the College of Veterinary
Medicine) and February  1985 (t'  Institute of Animal Science).   The audit
mission, however, found that a.i the project buildings in UPLB were still
incomplete  in December  1985.   Indeed,  the buildings for the Institute of
Animal Science were overgrown with wvee,`4,  It was estimated that UPLB needed
at least another P48.0 million Li complete the physical facilities as
originally planned.   At VISCA, the mission found that seven of the eight
laboratories were not operational because of incomplete furniture and equip-
ment.  Total gross area constructed, according to the PCR, was about 94,600
square meters, 37% more than planned.   The actual usable area in the audit
mission's estimate, however, may be about 20% less, in view of the incomplete
facilities referred to above.
12.       Furniture and Equipment Procurement.  As a consequence of building
construction delay, the procurement of furniture and equipment was delayed by
about  60  months  overall.    The  audit  mission  learned  that,  while  the
furniture  was  not  entirely  satisfactory,  it was  generally  usable.    The
academic staff, on the whole, was less satisfied with the equipment provided
by the project (PPAM, para. 26).   Some equipment was not what they wanted;
some was damaged by prolonged storage in rented warehouses without air
conditioning; and some did not work because of missing parts or improper
installation.   The problem of a misfit between equipment and end-users was
caused generally by departmental heads preparing equipment lists without
consulting the staff members who had to use the equipment.   In other cases
affecting the Farmer Training Centers (FTCs), the central authorities ordered
equipment without consulting the FTCs. The PCR points out that, at project
completion, the value of equipment delivered was P82.0 million, representing
86% of total equipment cost, and the value of furniture delivered was P15.6
million, roughly estimated at 84% of total furniture contracts awarded (PCR,
para. 2.12).
13.       Technical  Assistance.    The  project  provided  180 man-months  of
expert services and 4,056 man-months of fellowships at a total estimated cost
of US$4.9 million. In overall project outcome, technical assistance was the
most successful and, for long-term institution building, one of the most
important achievements. The number of persons trained was increased by 48X,
from the appraisal plan of 187 to actual implementation of 277.   This was
achieved at only 17% increase in total fellowship cost, partly through the
conversion of 38 of the original 180 man-months of expert services into
fellowships, and partly through the adoption of less costly academic staff
training schemes (PCR, paras. 2.13-2.14).   Implementation of the fellowship
program was delayed by (a) the inability of the institutions to release too
many staff simultaneously for overseas training without a corresponding



number of new appropriately qualified people to take their place; (b)
difficulty of some staff in gaining admission to foreign universities; and
(c) government  restrictions  on overseas  travel  (PCR,  para.  2.15).   The
fellowship program suffered a loss of about 20 fellows (72 of the total) who
were not expected to return to the Philippines upon completion of their
studies.   The net result,  nevertheless,  was impressive:    among  the 277
fellows were 138 who gained a doctoral degree and 29 a master's degree, while
31 were on post-doctoral and 79 on non-degree studies.  VISCA and UPLB have
been the main beneficiaries of the fellowship program.
14.       The use of expert services deviated somewhat from appraisal plans,
but generally to good effect. The saving of 38 man-months of expert services
originally allocated to UPCVM, amounting to about US$200,000, helped to
support  additional  fellowships.    Similarly,  two  man-years'  specialist
services for EDPITAF were used to fund additional fellowships for UELB and
EDPITAF staff as well as preparation of the Sixth and Seventh Education
Projects. A notable fact is that VISCA used six local experts (mainly from
UPLB) where none had been planned. Thus, the overall cost of expert services
was about one-third (US$257,000) of the appraisal estimate (US$825,000). The
involvement of foreign experts helped to establish links with international
organizations and the universities from which they came, and the collabor-
ation between VISCA and UPLB was mutually beneficial, especially to UPLB and
its status as a national center of excellence (PCR, paras. 2.17-2.19; Annex
4, Table 1).
Project Outcome
15.       Technical Panel for Agricultural Education (TPAE).  The establish-
ment of the TPAE (January 1971) ana the appointment of a ten-member panel
(March 1977) were conditions of project p^esentation to the Board which were
met  by  the  Government  after  some  initial  resistance  from  the  National
Economic Development Authority (NEDA) mainly because NEDA did not want yet
another "autonomous" para-statal body created at the behest of an external
funding agency.   The Bank,  however,  regarded  the TPAE,  which eventually
included representatives of the principal ministries responsible for agricul-
tural and rural development, as the key to unlock the problem of quality
improvement in agricultural education.   Thus, a compromise solution was to
establish the TPAE as an agency of the Bureau of Higher Education (BHE). The
actual function of the TPAE as a consultative and advisory body of the BHE,
however, fell short of the Bank's expectation that the Panel would have
effective control over the system of agricultural education by setting
minimum standards and pruning the sprawling growth of agricultural education
institutions.   Despite budgetary and administrative handicaps, the TPAE has
achieved the following:   (a) formulation of a master plan for agricultural
education known as the National Agricultural Education System (NAES);
(b) formulation of minimum educati:nal standards for 17 undergraduate and 26
postgraduate courses; (c) development of a national agricultural education
accreditation system; and (d) publication of a quarterly journal, The Medium,



-  7  -
with over 800 local and international subscribers.6/  Accepted in principle
by the BHE, the NAES, however, has not been fully implemented (PCR, paras.
3.01-3.04).
16.       The University of the Philippines at Los Banos (UPLB).  Under this
component, the project sought to improve the quality of teaching and the
output or graduates in the College of Forestry (CF), the Institute
(originally Department) of Animal Science (IAS), and the College of
Veterinary Medicine (CVM). As the PCR gives a fairly detailed account of the
project's assistance to these institutions (PCR, paras. 3.06-3.21), this
audit will merely highlight some of the more significant project outcomes.
17.       Student Enrollment and Graduate Output.  In the CF and IAS enroll-
ments fell short of the appraisal expectation because of lack of interest in
forestry and the presumed availability of other courses in animal science in
local institutions (PCR, paras. 3.06, 3.12).  The decision not to introduce
the planned two-year technician course at the IAS contributed to the low
enrollment.   At the CVM, however, enrollments during the period 1976-1981
surpassed appraisal expectations, but since then the CVM has deliberately
reduced enrollments because of limited fac4lities at the Diliman (Manila)
campus (PCR, para. 3.18).  In the output of graduates, the project succeeded
in progressively increasing the supply of trained agricultural manpower, as
shown by figures for the period 1975/76 - 1983/84 (PCR, Annex 5, Table 2;
Annex 6, Table 2; Annex 7, Table 2; and Annex 9, Table 2).   The combined
actual output from UPLB and VISCA, however, was about 67% of the projected
output. Between the two institutions, UPLB had a lower performance mainly
because the planned two-year technician course in Animal Science was not
implemented. Thus, UPLB's total actual output of 2,425 graduates was about
60% of the total projected output of 4,100.  Within UPLB there was consider-
able variation in graduate output among the project colleges.  In the CF, it
was about 80% of the appraisal projections of about 880.   In the AIS, the
output was only 36% of the appraisal target of 1,850 (PCR, paras. 3.08,
3.14). In the CVM the output of graduates in the doctoral program was more
or less on target, but the output in the master's program was only 13% of
expectation. At VISCA, the total actual output was 1,870 (about 83%) of the
total projected output of 2,260.  The combined shortfall in graduate output
from UPLB and VISCA was a blessing in disguise in view of the growing
unemployment in the agricultural sector.  It also suggests that the project
institutions were right in adjusting enrollments in response to employment
opportunities for their graduates.  In curric;lum improvement, the project's
achievement was mixed.   In the CF, the curriculum for the B.S. degree in
Forest Product Engineering, first offered in 1974, was revised in 1978 to
include Wood Science Technology and Management courses, but the planned
introduction of the Forest Product Technology degree and technician programs
had to be deferred because of the delayed completion of the Wood Science
building  (PCR, para.  3.09).   In the IAS,  the  two-year Animal Technician
course to be run jointly with the CVM was not introduced because of slackened

demand for graduates and lack of experienced staff to run the course.
Instead, a one-year animal production program, leading to the Diploma in
Agriculture, was introduced (PCR, para. 3.13).   In the CVM, the curriculum
was revised to increase the err?hasis on animal production, but the more
important change needed is to shift the focus from domestic pets to farm
animals.   As in the other  institutions,  the CVM's  teaching  programs  have
fallen short of the appraisal expectation because of incomplete physical
facilities.
18.       Staff  Development.    The  main emphasis  cf  the  project  in staff
development was in strengthening UPLB's capability in teaching, research and
extension. For this, the project provided 180 man-years for dcctoral fellow-
ships and 20 man-years for post-doctoral fellowships.  The project produced
81 Pn.D.s and 18 M.S. degrees, besides financing post-doctoral studies for 29
staff and non-degree programs for 15 staff (PCR, paras. 3.22-3.23: Annex 3).
19.       The Visayas State College of Agriculture (VISCA).   The project's
objective was to develop VISCA into a regional center of excellence.
Starting as an agricultural high school in 1924, VISCA evolved slowly into a
college in 1960.  But it was not until the early 1970s that VISCA's present
form began to emerge, and Loan 1374 provided the catalyst for its establish-
ment  as  the  strongest  agricultural  college  next  to  UPLB.    Enrollment
increased from about 600 in 1975 to nearly 1,600 in 1983, the majority of
students coming from the Visayas region.  Graduates increased over four-fold
between 1975 and 1983. Education and training programs now include two post-
graduate,  eight undergraduate and  two technician courses.   The number of
academic staff increased from 125 in 1975 to about 200 in 1985, most of whom
were recruited from UPLB, thus confirming UPLB's role as a "multiplier"
institution.  VISCA's 14 academic departments, six special research centers,
a social laboratory, a radio station, a publications office and a regional
training center have been active in a wide range of research and extension
activities (PCR, paras. 3.24-3.32; Annex 9),7/
20.       The Philippine Training Centers for Rural Development (PTC-RD).  To
assist the Government to develop a national system of inservice training for
field extension workers and farmer leaders, the project supported the
establishmenit of a National Training Center (NTC, located at UPLB), five
Regional rraining Centers (TRCs, each hosted by a strategically located
agricultural college or university),8/ and six pilot Farmer Training Centers
(FTCs, located in strategic government stations to serve major food produc-
tion areas). Together these centers comprise the PTC-RD network regulated by
the National Governing Board (NGB) which is responsible for policies and

guidelines, budgeting and performance evaluation. Members of the NGB include
the UPLB Chancellor and the Ministers of the Ministries of Agriculture;
Agrarian  Reform;  Local  Government  and  Community  Development;  Natural
Resources;  and  Education,  Culture  and  Sports.    All  the  centers  were
constructed and equipped before the price escalation of 1979, and they are
fully staffed and in operation although in varying capacities because of
inadequate budgetary support for training programs.
21.       The  coordination  and  routine  management  of  the system are  the
responsibility of the National Coordinating Office which operates as a
secretariat.   The NTC's  role,  besides developing curricula and extension
methods  and  materials,  and  providing  technical  assistance,  is  to  train
trainers for the RTCs. The RTCs, in turn, were expected to train by 1981 a
total  of  18,000  extension  workers  from  the  Ministries  of  Agricultare
(responsible for agricultural extension, plant industry, animal industry, and
soils), Natural Resources, Agrarian Reform, and Local Government aiid
Community Development.   The extension workers would then train, over a five
year period, 45,000 farmer leaders each of whom, in turn, would train an
average of 10 farmers in his village so that eventually 450,000 farmers would
be  reached  indirectly  in  the  concurrent  five  year  period.    In  actual
performance the PTC-RD network trained about 22,500 extension workers and
I ,000 farmer leaders, despite a shortage of funds for training programs
C 'R, para. 3.38).   A survey of a sample of extension workers and farmers
t ained in 1982 showed that the training apparently was linked to signiticant
eases in farm production (PCR, para. 3.39).9/
22.       Sustainability.   As established institutions of higher educatiun,
UPLB (a national center of excellence) and VISCA (a regional center o.9f
excellence) raise no question about their sustainability, especially wiheni thk-
Government  is  directly  responsible  for  their  operating  cost  and  thetr
continuing development.   The viability of individual departments,  however,
may fluctuate according to the demand for skilled manpower, as evidenced by
the student enrollments in UPLB's College of Forestry and Institute of Animal
Science,  but  these  fluctuations  can normally  be accommodated  wichiin  the
larger framework of the university. The PTC-RD being newer, less established
as an institution, needs constant monitoring of its functions anid responsi-
bilities which, when proven to be vital to increasing agricultural prodLic-
tion, should have the necessary budgetary support at the right time. !inking
all the above together is the TPAE whose existence the Governmenit pledged to
maintain until December 31, 1986 (Section 3.02 (a) of the Loan Agreement,
9/   EDPITAF,  "A Tracer Study of Graduates/Trainees under the Fo Lrtht LBRD
Education Project (Study Findings)," Vol. I, January 1984. The Geavral
objectives of the study were  to "document,  review,  and evaluate  the
training programs conducted by the PTC-RD in terms of their impact. on
the productivity of the trainees."  The study showed that after-tra:i-IJg
agricultural production improved as follows:   rice and vegetahbes .'2/;
corn - 46%; swine - 86%; poultry - 15%; cattle - 30%; goats - 9X;  m d
ducks - 36%.

dited March 25, 1977) buc beyond which, if the TPAE is disbanded, the ground-
work laid by the Panel for maintaining quality in agricultural education and
training will be wasted.   It is therefore vital for the Government through
the BHE to maintain the TPAE beyond 1986.
Total Project Cost
23.       The total actual project cost, according to the PCR, was P369.1
million, exceeding the appraisal estimate of P339.5 million by 8.7% but, in
US dollars equivalent, the actual cost was US$26.4 million (stated only in
the key project data table, not in the text) which, compared with the
appraisal  estimate  of  US$45.3  million,  was  "about  422  below  appraisal
estimate due to the devaluation of the peso" (PCR, para. 4.01).  Apparently
the US$26.4 million was the result of dividing P369.1 million by 14, the
exchange value of the peso against the US dollar in 1984, the completion year
of the project. The audit's analysis of the Government's quarterly progress
reports shows that, as of December 31, 1983, the estimated total project cost
was about US$48.5, which exceeded the appraisal estimate by about 7%, a
figure which the audit considers more credible (Attachment I).  A comparison
of the total project cost as appraised,  as presented by the PCR, and as
estimated by this audit is presented in the table below.

III. FINDINGS AND ISSUES
Overview
24.       The project's objectives of increasing the supply of well-qualified
agricultural manpower and improving the quality of agricultural education and
training have been uet but not to the extent expected at appraisal.  As a
result of the large fellowship program, UPLB and VISCA have collectively
increased the number of staff with a doctoral or a master's degree (PPAM,
para. 13).  This will eventually contribute to the quality of education in
these  institutions.   Student graduate output in the main disciplines  in
agricultural education has also increased but at lower rates than planned,
partly in response to a fluctuating market demand and partly as a consequence
of the failure to complete some of the physical facilities at UPLB.  The
unanticipated rapid ptrce escalation in 1979-1980 delayed the construction of
buildings at UPL.B, seriously affecting the introduction of new courses and
improvement of teaching and research in the College of Forestry, Institute of
Animal Science and College of Veterinary Medicine. On the other hand, VISCA



- II -
seemed to have weathered the price escalation storm reasonably well and has
emerged as a strong regional center of excellence.   A tracer study carried
out under the guidance of EDPITAF showed that the majority (80) of graduates
were  employed  after  a  three  or  four-month  job  search,  and  that  farm
productivity increased significantly after training provided by the PTC-RD.
The TPAE, despite staff and budget constraints, did produce guidelines for
maintaining minimum academic standards and regulating the hitherto unbridled
expansion of agricultural education institutions. To be sure, many problems
remain unsolved and new issues have arisen. The following pages will discuss
some of these issues as well as the project's main findings.
Findings and Lessons
25.       Project Management.   The transfer of project management responsi-
bility from EDPITAF to the sub-PIUs of UPLB and VISCA (in 1980) was made
apparently without adequate preparation.   The confusion over implementation
responsibility during a period when building contracts had to be renegotiated
adversely affected the outcome of the project's civil works program (1TPAM,
paras.  27-28 below and PCR, para. 6.05).   The non-completion of importallt
facilities for the College of Forestry, College of Veterinary Medic.ne and
the Institute of Animal Science curtailed their educational programs and
ultimately the output of i,raduates in these specializations. The ostensible
reason for the transfer of responsibilities was that EDPITAF was to be
dissolved in 1982 when the original ten-year mandate for its establishment in
1972 was due to expire.  Tuas, EDPITAF became PDIMO (Project Development and
Implementation Management Office) but in late 1985 reverted to its original
acronym.  In any case, the transfer of responsibility did not appear to have
benefited UPLB, judging from the unfinished buildings, but VISCA was able to
use force account to complete substantially its civil works. The reorganizai-
tion of EDPITAF was symptomatic of the Governmert's attempt to rearrange its
internal review system, which is discussed further under paragraphs 27-28.
The project experience suggests that, major changes in project management
during  the  life  of  the  project  should  be avoided  but,  if unavoidahle,
adequate measures should be taken to ensure that the changes would not
adversely aft ct project implementation.
26.       L   pment Procurement.  Most of the staff interviewed by the audit
mission in th  project institutions visited were dissatisfied with much of
the equipment they had or were expected Lo use.  They declared that ei.her
they did not get the equipment specified or they had not been corFAUlted
before the equipment was ordered.   In some cases the equipment could not be
used because it was inappropriate or because parts were missing (or even
because there was no instructional manual; or, when there was one, iL was in
a language they could not read).  A general complalnt was about poor follow-
up service and the lack of spare parts.  Some of these problems were due to
staff turnover and the deterioration of equipment cauted by prolonged storage
under adverse conditions necessitated by the delayed completion of buildings
where the equipment on arrival should have been installed.   Other problzms
stemmed from a mismatch of the equipment and the building housing it.  The
project experience suggests that: (a) end-users should be consulted when



-  12  -
equipment lists are being prepared; (b) the procurement of equipment should
take  into account  the availability  of spare parts and  followup  service;
(c) end-users should be involved in the inspection and testing of equipment
on delivery; and (d) where large, heavy or delicate equipment is involved,
extra care should be taken to ensure that the space provided Liatches the
equipment.
27.       Financial Planning and Budgetary Procedures.  The insufficiency of
Government counterpart funds to meet the unexpected price escalation in
1979-80 was the consequence of the prevailing procedures for financial and
budgetary planning and approval. When contractors requested an adjustment of
contract prices to offset rising costs due to spiraling priczs of construc-
tion materials and labor, the matter had to be reviewed by the President's
Office because price adjustments, among other things, were not built into the
original contracts. The consequent delay and the slow release of funds from
the Budget Ministry eventually contributed to the contractors' abandonment of
the construction work. Aware that these problems affected all sectors of the
economy, the Government in early 1980 revised the regulations and procedures
governing civil works procurement.10/   As the policy change affected Bank
projects across all seccors, it may be useful to highlight three salient
points of the 1980 revised regulations:   (a) henceforth there would be a
common policy and a standard set of rules and procedures for all civil works
procurement undertaken by the Government regardlqss of the agency involved;
(b) the Sovernment would include a price escalation clause in all future
contracts where inflation or Government price controls were expected to
affect the final cost of the work; (c) the limits of delegated authority to
Ministers to approve contracts were raised from P2.0 million to P10.0 million
for LCB contracts and to P40.0 million for ICB contracts which required
concurrence from a foreign financing institution.
28.       The  Bank's  experience  in  the  Philippines  suggerts  that  closer
attention should be given to the Government's budgetary procedures when a
project implementation schedule is being prepared. It is essential to ensure
a close link between the budget cycle and the construction season to secure
adequate funds for implementing agencies by late December or early January.
This would enable civil works construction to start early in the construction
season.  The Government in 1978-79 had revised certain budget procedures to
improve financial discipline among line agencies to encourage them to esti-
mate their financial requirements more accurately.   The revised procedures
were also designed to support better planning of financial requirements for
foreign-assisted and domestic projects, but at the same time allow for
sufficient flexibility to facilitate effective project implementation. Cost
overrun problems were to be solved by the provision of a standard price
escalation tied to economic indices instead of a case-by-case review of
contracts as in the past.  This procedure was being linked to the budgetary
process to ensure that adequate funds were available to cover construction
10/ Presidential Decree 1594, "Implementing Rules and Regulations concerning
Government Infrastructure Contracts," dated February 25, 1980.

cost increases resulting from inflation.   These measures, however, did not
seem to have helped the project in the renegotiated contracts for the civil
works at UPLB. By late 1983, when all construction was supposed to have been
completed, contractors were hit by abrupt price increases of materials due to
the devaluation of the peso (the exchange rate fell to P14.0 to the US$).
Although a price escalation was built into the renegotiated contracts, in
practice  no additional  funds  were made available  for the project.   Any
subsequent increased cost of construction was to be recovered from the
reduction or simplification of construction equivalent to a maximum of 12% of
the remaining construction work.   In this project the application of such
price escalation led to the abandonment of the remaining construction.
Issues Arising
29.       UPLB-CVM and UPLB-IAS.   The audit concurs with the PCR that two
issues which require resolution are:   (a) the proposed technician course in
animal science, which was to be run jointly by the UPLB-CVM and the UPLB-LAS,
and (b) the relocation of the CVM from the Diliman campus to Los Banos (PCR,
para. 5.07).   If the technician course is to be dropped, the question that
arises is what alternative use will be made of the physical facilities pro-
vided by the project. Furthermore, what measures will be taken, and by whom,
to monitor the national supply of technicians in animal science? Part of the
original argument for relocating the CVM was that being close to the IAS
would facilitate cocrlination if not  integration in teaching.   But staff
reluctance to move from metropolitan Manila to the relative isolation of Los
Banos was cited as the main reason for the CVM's non-transfer to Los Banos.
The current proposed solution is to have two branches of the CVM: the one in
Diliman should specialize in domestic pets and the other in Los Banos in farm
animals.
30.       TPAE.  The PCR appears to convey two viewpoints on the role of the
TPAE. The Government viewpoint is that the bank at appraisal was unrealistic
in expecting the TPAE to serve as a means of ridding the system of substand-
ard agricultural educational institutions and controlling enrollment expan-
sion.   The Bank viewpoint is that the inability of the TPAE to consolidate
and control the agricultural education system remains the must important out-
standing issue. Ihe Bank continues to pursue this issue through the ongoing
Fishery Training Project (Loan 1786-PH) by seeking clarification of the
TPAE's role in controlling the spread of fishery schools and maintaining
standards (PCR, paras. 6.02-6.03).   As a consultative and advisory body to
the BHE, the TPAE has no constitutional powers to enforce the minimum stand-
ards it has established for agricultural programs.   The Bank, nevertheless,
expected, or perhaps hoped, that the TPAE's minimum standards and accredita-
tion of agricultt'ral educational institutions might serve as the basis of the
Government's  budgetary  allocations  which  would  reduce  or  deny  financial
assistance to substandard institutions and thus control their expansion or
even eliminate them.11/  Ironically, the Bank realized only towards the end

393-PH), OED Report No. 4472 dated May 6, 1983 (para. 8.08).



- 14 -
of the project that such minimum standards could not be enforced (PCR, para.
6.02).14/  In the present case, however, the basic issue is not the TPAE as
such, but what alternative strategy to adopt to achieve the ultimate objec-
tive of high quality agricultural education. In this audit's view, the TPAE
has laid the foundation for changing the system of agricultural education.
It has established its credibility as an impartial, competent professional
body.   Its existence, however, is not guaranteed beyond December 31, 1986,
when the Government will be released from its pledge to maintain the TPAE.
To ensure that the achievements of the TPAE and the investments made under
this project towards quality improvement are not dissipated, the Government
should maintain the TPAE as an integral part of the BHE.
3!.       Project Co,ts.  There appears to be a wide discrepancy between the
total actual project cost reported by thke PCR and that reported by the
Government's quarterly progress report (QPR) for the last quarter of 1983.
The audit's reconstruction of the project's cumulative cost, using the QPRs
from 1977 to 1983, arrived at a total rather different from that given in the
PCR (see Attachment 1).   It should be stressed that the reconstruction of
project costs year by year was merely a heuristic exercise to see whether the
PCR's general conclusion about project costs was valid.
32.       The PCR's total project cost is P369.1 million compared with the
audit's  estimate  of P434.9 million, a difference of P65.8 million.   The
prob]em seems to stem from the method used to convert one currency into
another.   To compute the total actual cost ir local currency or US dollars
equivalent--and both currencies should be given to facilitate comrarison with
the appraisal estimates which are always in the local currency and the US
dollars equivalent--the Bank's preferred m-thod is to apply the exchange rate
prevailing in each year against expenditures in that year (OMS 3.58, Annex,
,July 1978, para.  19).   It is important that the statement of final total
actual project cost should be as accurate as possible.  To ensure account-
ability for project implementation funds, the Bank requires each project to
have an adequate accounting and internal control system for recording and
reporting project-related financial transactions from the time project
expenditures commence.  There are no exceptions to this requirement, accord-
ing to Central Projects Note 3.05, IIIA, para. 3.02 which, however, is dated
June 1982.  No audit report from the Government was submitted for this proj-
ect because it was approved at a time when auditing requirements did not
apply to education projects.   It should be added that the audit does not
doubt that EDPITAF had a satisfactory accounting system which is demonstrated
by the detailed reporting in the quarterly progress reports.    What needs
emphasis here is that the basic information on actual project costs serves as
the reference point for an overall evaluation of the adequacy of the Bank's
12/  An  interesting  parallel  is the case of Bangladesh where,  under  the
Agricultural and Rural Training Project (Credit 621-BD) the high-level
inter-ministerial National Cormittee on Rural Training (NCRT) especially
established under the project, was unable to fulfill the Bank's expecta-
tion that the NCRT would be able to integrate rural training policies
through a comprehensive plan to strengthen the rural training system.

financial support and the sufficiency of the Government's financial provision
for the project. This matter is particularly relevant to this project where
UPLB's teachLng prograuA in forestry, animal science and veterinary medicine
were adversely affected by an insufficiency of funds.   Without  further
belaboring the point, it is sufficient to conclude here with the recom-
mendation that (a) PCRs should follow Bank guidelines in preparing cost
estimates; \.) Government and project auditors should review available cost
estimates; and (c) the Bank's internal audit department should undertake a
special audit of this project.13/
13/ A similar suggestion was made in the audit of the Burundi Fisheries
Project.    See  PPAR,  Burundi--Fisheries  Development  Project  (Credit
626-BU), OED Report No. 5683 dated June 3, 1985 (paras. 55-57).

The above estimated project expenditures and costs are recon-
structed from figures in the quarterly progress reports (QPR) which were sent
by the Government  to the Bank.   The QPR figures were all in US dollars
equivalent.   In Table 1, the expenditures in US dollars equivalent incurred
each year were converted to Pesos using the average annual market exchange
rate for the particular year. In Table 2 the cost by category of expanditure
in US dollars equivalent is taken from the QPR for the period ending December
31, 1983, and the conversion to Pesos is based on the average exchange rate
of P8.9752 for the period 1977-1983.
The reconstruction of i:he above estimated project expenditures and
costs is merely a heuristic exetcise to try and arrive at a more accurate
estimate of the total actual project cost in Pesos and in US dollars
equivalent. The cost should be verified by the Government.
It should be stressed that the total project expenditures through
ecemnber 31, 1983 still left a ,iumber of buildings in UPLB unfinished, unfur-
niished and without equipment. Similarly, a number laboratories in VISCA were
not furnished and equipped at the time of "project completion."  Therefore, a
much more accurate total project cost should include the cost of completing
the construction, furnishing and equipping of all the unfinished project
hubl dings.

PHILIPPINES
AGRICULTURE EDUCATION PROJECT
I. COMPLETION REPORT PREPARED BY THE COVERNMENT
A. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
The Setting
1.01      The Four-Year Development Plan (FY74-77) of the Republic of the
Philippines was aimed at raising the GNP growth rate to about 7% per year in
real terms cnd to increase the employment rate to over 4% per year.
1.02      At the time of project formulation the agricultural education system
generally lacked quality and relevance due to rapid proliferation of institu-
tions which were substandard, overcrowded and underequipped. The rapid
growth, accompanied by financial constraints and the inadequate number of well
trained teaching staff, had led to low quality instruction. As a result,
graduates at all levels were poorly trained and had difficulty in qualifying
for employment in their respective fields. Most in-service training programs
were ad hoc.
1.03      The substantial increase in enrollment at the higher level of
agricultural education over the decade (1964-1974) from 4,000 to 31,000 and
the proliferation of agricultural institutions warranted the rationalization
and improvement of the system. To respond more adequately to development
needs, the agricultural education system needed: (a) consolidation to allow
better allocation of resources to improve the quality of selected
institutions; (b) improved quality of technician training; and (c) creation of
a system of non-formal education.
1.04      The Bank began to support agricultural education in 1964 (Loan 393-
PH) when it assisted in financing a development program at the Los Bafios
College of Agriculture (UPLB-CA), with the objective of establishing UPLB as a
national center of excellence in agricultural education. Under the Sccond
Education Project (Credit 349-PH) two Regional Agricultural Colleges were
supported together with agricultural high schools.
Project Formulation
1.05      Based on the findings and policy,7ecommcndations of the Presidential
Commission to Survey Philippine Education,- reforms needed in the
1/   The commission by virtue of an Executive Order was created to assess the
Philippine Educational System. The assessment was completed in eight
months and the reconnendation were embodied in the report "Education for
National Development."

Philippines' educational system were identified including the rationalization
and improvement of the agricultural education subsystem. In September 1972,
the Educational Development Projects Implementating Task Force (EDPITAF) was
established by Presidential Decree 6-A to undertake the implementation of
development projects financed by external loans.
1.06      In April/May 1974 a UNESCO Pro]ect Identification Mission recom-
mended support for rural development, including the development of the Visayas
Agricultural College and support for the University of the Philippines'
College of Fisheries and College of Veterinary Medicine. Following an IBRD
Reconnaissance Mission in December 1974, a UNESCO Project Preparation Mission
assisted in preparing a loan request of a Third Education Project which was
submitted to IBRD in March 1975. The loan request covered: (1) basic
education development; and (2) rural development, including Visayas College of
Agriculture, support to UP College of Forestry and College of Veterinary
Medicine, a system of fisheries education and the development of multi-purpose
training centers for agriculture and rural development.
1.07      The agricultural education component was processed as a separate
loan which was pre-appraised by a World Bank mission in January/February 1976
and appraised in November 1976. Negotiations were held in Washington in
January 1977, the loan signed in March 1977 and the project became effective
in June 1977.
Project Description
1.08      The main objectives of the Project were to improve the quality of
agricultural education and training and to increase the supply of qualified
agricultural manpower. The project aimed to implement the Government's agri-
cultural education development strategy by: (i) creating the Technical Panel
for Agricultural Education (TPAE); (ii) strengthening the staff of the Univer-
sity of the Philippines at Los Baiios (UPLB); (iii) upgrading the UPLB-College
of Forestry (UPLB-CF), UPLB-Department of Animal Science (UPLB-DAS), and the
UP-College of Veterinary Medicine (UPCVM); (iv) establishing and strengthening
the Visayas State College of Agriculture (ViSCA); and (v) creating the Philip-
pine Training Centers for Rural Development (PTC-RD). The project provided
civil works, furniture, equipment and technical assistance for the above
inscitutions.
1.09      The benefits determined at appraisal are summarized as follows:
(i) the UPLB would be strengthened as a strong national center of excellence
and as a major source of competent manpower and technical advice; (ii) the
proposed network of training centers for rural development (Regional Training
Centers and Farmer Training Centers) would assist the Government investment
program in increasing production in crops and livestock; and (iii) the
proposed Visayas State College of Agriculture (ViSCA) would provide the
Visqyas region with a strong center for applied research, extension, manpower
production, and assistance to related institutions within the region
(Visayas).

B. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Overall Project Management
2.01       In accordance with the Loan Agreement, EDPITAF was responsible for
project implementation, including overall project administration, procurement,
financial control and liaison with the Bank. A Rural Development Sector (RDS)
of EDPITAF was set up to coordinate project implementation but was disbanded
in 1979 and its functions and staff were absorbed by another EDPITAF unit,
which was subsequently disbanded in 1980. These frequent organizational
changes and high staff turnover led to EDPITAF's inability to effectively
address implementation problems including tnose in civil works.
2.02       In 1977, EDPITAF drew up Memoranda of Agreement with UPLB and ViSCA
to establish separate project implementation units (sub-PIUs) at each
institution. Both sub-PIUs operated effectively under the overall supervision
of EDPITAF. However, implementation of civil works was often not carried out
as planned because the major decisions on building construction and procure-
ment were made centrally at EDPITAF. In August 1980, EDPITAF entered into
another Memoranda of Agreement with UPLB and ViSCA entrusting them with full
management responsibilities including construction and procurement. Project
maintenance and operating budgets which were provided by EDPITAF until 1982,
were channeled through the regular appropriations of the project institutions.
2.03       The decentralization was coupled with a series of reorganizations of
EDPITAF into the Foreign-Assisted Projects Office (1982), then later into the
present Project Development and Implementation Management Office (1984). The
effect of the frequent changes led Bank supervision missions to express
concern over the lack of delineation of clear responsibilities for managing
project implementation.
Civil Works
2.04       The Project allocated about P 183 million (including contingencies)
for new buildings for the project institutions to be built in 48 selected
sites. Construction was originally planned to start in July 1977 and be
completed in June 1979, an overall construction period of 23 months. All the
required project sites were acquired and surveyed as planned and schematic
designs of buildings were prepared and approved by the Bank. Tendering
proceeded without major problems, in accord with the Bank's International
Competitive Bidding although no foreign firm responded. Contract awards were,
however, delayed by an average of four months after bidding due to delays in
contract preparation and internal approval.  the first contract was awarded in
Deceniber 1977, while the last in April 1979.-   The total costs of contracts
amounted to P 128.00 million which was much less than rhe appraisal estimate
2/   The Farmers Training Center in Leyte was the last to be bid and awarded
because the project site was relocated from the town of Alang-ALang to
Sab-a.



- 22 -
of P 183.00 million. Construction of the first buildings began at ViSCA and
the PTC-RD in March 1978, eight months behind the appraisal schedule.
2.05       Progress of construction was hampered from late 1979 due to rapid
price escalation of construction materials and labor, forcing contractors to
seek cost adjustments. However, the absence of a provision for cost adjust-
ments in the original civil work contracts and shortage of funds caused
construction to stop in 1980. It was at this crucial stage that EDPITAF
entrusted UPLB and ViSCA with respnsibilities for civil works and this
resulted in a management gap at a time when close project supervision was most
needed.
2.06      Remedial actions taken by the project institutions to help contrac-
tors included the opening of letter of credit for procurement of construction
materials and shorter intervals between progress payments, but these proved
futile. Five contracts (one in ViSCA and four in UPLB) were subsequently
terminated. ViSCA's contract was taken over by the college's Physical Plant
Office and construction was done by force account, while the UPLB contracts
were retendered as smaller contract packages. An additional P 50 million were
granted by the Budget Ministry for the completion of the project buildings.
2.07      The Bank extended the project closing date by two ycars when it
became apparent that Project buildings at UPLB and ViSCA could not be comple-
ted within the stipulated period. Delays in construction hindered the intro-
duction of planned courses. By the extendeo closing date of December 31,
1983, all project buildings except those at UPLB were fully completed and
operational (Annex 1, Table 1).
2.08      Generally, the buildings were well-de:igned although overall
aesthetic quality, particularly at UPLB, suffered as designs and finishes were
simplified due to limited funds and cost increases. In one case, the
operating theaters in the Animal Disease and Diagnostic Laboratory, the design
was oversimplified.
2.09      The gross area constructed was approximately 37Z larger than the
appraisal plan, i.e., total area constructed was increased from 68,820 to
94,580 square meters (Annex 1, Table 2). The deLision to increase building
size at the expense of quality of finishes is likely to result in higher
maintenatnce costs. Overall, the actual building cost of about P 188 million
is only about 3% more than the appraisal estimate of P 183 million. Actual
loan disbursement on civil works amounted to P 49.5 million or roughly 23Z of
the total cost. Professional fees amounted to P 10.5 million or only about 5%
of the construction cost, compared with an appraisal estimate of 8%. Some of
the savings were the result of using EDPITAF's architects to design the PTC-RD
Training Centers.
Equipment and Furniture Procurement
2.10       Project cost estimates included about P 87.0 million and P 11.6 mil-
lion (including contingencies) worth of equipment and furniture respective-
ly. The first equipment and furniture package was to be procured by the last
quarter of 1977.



- 23 -
2.11      The first equipment package was awarded as planned in October
1977. The first furniture package was, however, delayed by about 23 months in
order to coincide with the completion of buildings. The total cost of
equipment procured under the project amounted to P 95 million, 9% higher than
the appraisal estimate, including contingencies (Annex 2). Furniture pro-
cured, on the other hand totalled P 18.5 million, 60% more than original
estimate (Annex 2).
2.12      The value of equipment delivered by the end of the project reached
P 82.0 million, representing 86% of the total equipment cost. Furniture
deliveries are estimated at P 15.6 million or roughly 84% of the total
furniture awarded. Actual loan drawdown of furniture and equipment combined
amounted to US$11.0 million, 10% higher than the revised allocation. The
increase was obtained from savings on consultant services. Also, delay in the
construction of buildings necessitated the renting of a warehouse, adding to
the costs, and the prolonged storage of sensitive instruments caused their
physical deterioration.
Fellowship Program
2.13       The implementation of the fellowship program, which started in
September 1976 under retroactive financing from the loan was successful. The
considerable program expansion (481 in terms of participants and 39% in man-
months) was achieved at only 17% increase in total costs. The expansion was
possible largely due to the: (a) adoption by ViSCA of a less costly Ph.D.
scheme whereby grantees spend one year of study at a foreign university and
two years including thesis writing at a local university, instead of the more
expensive appraisal plan of three years of study abroad; and (b) conversion of
some of the experts services allocation into degree fellowships. On average
it took 4-12 months longer than expected for MSc and Ph.D. fellows to obtain
their degrees.
2.14      Actual average costs per man-year of doctoral (US$8,860.00) and
master degree (USS9,400) fellowships were lower than the appraisal estimates
of US$12,000 and US$10,000, respectively. The actual lower costs however, may
have been achieved at the inconvenience of the grantees in view of their
complaints of insufficient subsistence and other allowances. The post
doctoral fellowship allocation per man-year was increased from US$15,000 to
US$18,000 in April 1980 in order to attract candidates. Average actual cost
per man-year, however, amounted to US$19,570. In order to overcome delays in
stipend remittances, a revolving account was set up for fellowship funds.
2.15      Other problems which contributed to the delay in completion of the
fellowship program included the following: (a) inability of the institutions
to release many staff for fellowships at the same time due to lack of
appropriately-qualified substitutes; (b) difficulty of obtaining travel
authorities and cleatances due to Govwnment restrictions; (c) difficulties
experienced by some fellows in getting admission to foreign universities; and
(d) the loss of about 20 fellcws who are unlikely to return upon completion of
their degrees. (Fellowship participants are contracted to fulfill three years
of service for every year of study abroad.)



- 24 -
2.16      The fellowship program was successful in upgrading the qualifi-
cations of staff of the project institutions: e.g. at UPLB the number of PhD
holders increased from 163 to 235 and MS holders from 185 to 313 as a direct
result of the program. Its successful implementation was due to the existence
at EDPITAF of a working system for fellowship placement and administration
including a Fellowship Coordinating Committee and to special arrangements such
as the revolving fund.
Specialist Services
2.17      Actual employment of experts' services deviated considerably from
appraisal plans (Annex 4, Table 1). ViSCA effectively used foreign experts -
including post-doctoral fellows in combination with local consultants, mostly
from UPLB.  It employed 7 foreign specialists for 84 man-months, compared with
the appraisal estimate of 5 for 48 man-months. The UPCVM employed only
3 short-term foreign consultants for about 12 man-months in total instead of 7
for 54 months as planned at appraisal. About US$200,000 of UPCVM experts'
services allocation was transferred to support additional fellowships.
2.18      The funds for two man-years of specialists' services originally
intended to assist EDPITAF to carry out feasibility studies for future
education development projects was used for initial activities of the Sixth
and Seventh Education Projects and for additional fellowships for UPLB and
EDPITAF.
2.19      Foreign experts assessed their consultancy experiences as generally
satisfactory except for inadequate preparation of work programs by the project
institutions and unsatisfactory living conditions at ViSCA. Project institu-
tions were generally satisfied with the experts' performance. Apart from
their direct contributions in teaching and research, their presence facili-
tated the establishment of linkages with international organizations and
universities. The performance of local experts at ViSCA was satisfactory and
the consultancy arrangements enhanced collaboration between ViSCA and UPLB.
The Bank's Role
2.20      The Bank sent 13 supervision missions during the project period.
The majority of the missions were short in duration, allowing only a few
institutions or sites to be visited. Agricultural educators were included in
only four visits during the six and a half years of project period. There was
also a gap in supervision between July 1978 when the first delays in civil
works were noted, and September 1979 by which time the delays in construction
had become serious.
C. OUTCOMES BY PROJECT COMPONENT
Technical Panel for Agricultural Education (TPAE)
3.01      Organization.  In accordance with Section 3.02 of the Loan
Agreement, TPAE was created under the Bureau of Higher Education (BHE) in
January, 1977 by virtue of Department of Education and Culture (now a
Ministry) Order No. 3. The order also created a Secretariat for the Panel
headed by an Executive Secretary. The appointments of the 10 Panel members
were confirmed and the Executive Secretary appointed in January 1978. The



- 25 -
Panel included representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry
of Natural Resources, the Ministry of Agrarian Reform and the Ministry of
Local Government and Community Development, among others.
3.02      In May 1979, the Secretariat moved from EDPITAF, in Manila, to UPLB
to enable closer coordination with the Vice-Chairman of the Panel who was
based in UPLB and who directly supervised the Secretariat, as well as the
Panel's Policy and Technical Advisory Group, The move facilitated the
independence of the TPAE from EDPITAF and gave it wider access to the pool. of
UPLB experts in various fields of agriculture.
3.03      Section 3.02(b) of the Loan Agreement called for an adequately
staffed Secretariat, however due to budgetary constraints, the Panel could not
employ full-time specialists to coordinate the work in the five main disci-
pline areas under the TPAE technical committees. The low salaries and
insecurity of tenure discouraged highly experienced people from staffing the
Secretariat (Chart 1).
3.04      Rationalizing Agricultural Education.  Despite budgetary and
organizational constraints, the Panel made some progress toward rationalizing
agricultural education through (i) the formulation of a national plan for
agricultural education in the Philippines; (ii) the establishment of minimum
standards and (iii) the initiation of a system for school evaluation. The
plan was approved in principle but not fully implemented. To date, TPAE has
formulated minimum standards for 43 agricultural programs and approved by
MECS. Of the 276 institutions currently offering agricultural programs in the
country, the Panel has evaluated about 203 and of about 400 agricultural
programs being offered, the Panel has evaluated about 170.
3.05      The project placed considerable importance on the Panel's role in
controlling enrollment growth and eliminating substandard institutions through
the accreditation scheme. Expectations of the Panel's controlling role were
however optimistic in light of its function as an advisory body to the BHE.
Furthermore, the Bank Appraisal Report did not define in detail the Panel's
operational activities and timetable of implementation as it did with the
other project components. Although the Bank recognized the crucial role of
the Panel (Bank Appraisal Report paras. 2.23 and 5.03), it was allocated only
2 man-years of fellowships for the Secretariat and its operation was financed
almost entirely from local counterpart funds.
University of the Philippines at Loa Razios - College of Forestry
(UPLB-CF) (Annex 5)
3.06      Admission and Enrollment.  To ensure adequate intake of students,
the UPLB-CF established on a series of forestry career orientati^n courses for
junior high school students from different regions of the country. When these
proved ineffective, recruitment teams visited schools to conduct orienration
seminars. In spite of these efforts there has been a shortfall in enrollments
into degree courses although targets for post-graduate enrollmernts have been
satisfactorily met. Enrollments are also inflated by repeaters as only 10-15%
of degree students complete their degree courses on schedule.



- 26 -
3.07      At the non-degree level, enrollments have risen but are still well
below target. Furthermore, this forest ranger course has become a "pre-
entrance" university course rather than a source of technican manpower.
Tracer studies and college records show that about 80% of the successful
studo  , from this course go on to degree programs.
3.08      Graduates.  Actual output at all levels from SY75/76 to SY8O/81
totalled 714, which is only 81% of the appraisal projections of 883. About
85% of graduates have passed the professional examination set by the Board of
Examiners for Foresters and employers have high regard for UPLB-CF graduates.
3.09      Curricular Changes.  It was planned that the College would develop
two new programs in Forest Product Engineering (FPE) and Forest Product
Technology (FPT). The Bachelor of Science in FPE was first offered in 1974
and the curriculum was revised in 1978 to include several Wood Science
Technology and Management courses, but the Forest Product Technology degree
and technician programs have not been offered due to the delayed completion of
the Wood Science building.
3.10      Staff Development.  The project provided 48 man-years of fellowships
to train 15 staff, compared with appraisal estimates of 34 man-years for 13
staff. The current staff of 72 is 20% below the appraisal target consistent
with the limited enrollment growth and curricular expansion. However, the
staff profile shows a considerable upgrading, with 83% of the staff holding
graduate degrees compared to 61% at apprdisal.
University of the Philippines at Los Banos-Institute of Animal Science (UPLB-
IAS) (Annex 6)
3.11      Institutional Development.  The Department of Animal Science became
the Institute of Animal Science in recognition of its leadership in the field
of animal science research.
3.12      Admission and Enrollment.  The planned increase in total enrollment
from 200 to 610 was not achieved: actual enrollment in 1983/84 was only 238,
less than in half that expected. The shortfall was due partly to the
(i) failure to introduce the planned 2-year animal technician course; (ii) the
growth of regional agricultural colleges which have attracted prospective
students who otherwise would have applied to UPLB; and (iii) restrictions oil
intake at graduate level due to limited facilities and funds. The expected
expansicn of the Institute's teaching of students from other facilities was
also :lot realized because these courses too failed to expand.
3.13      Curricular Changes.  The planned two-year Animal Technician Course
to be run jointly with UPCVM has not been introduced because of a lack of
employment opportunities for graduates. Also the staff do not have the
exporience required to run a technician course. A one-year graduate program
in animal production leading to the Diploma in Agriculture was introduced in
rusponse to the need of the Ministry of Agriculture to train their technical
personnel in up-to-date animal production skills.
3.14      Graduates.  The actual total output of 669 from SY1975/76 to
SY1983/84 was far below the appraisal projection of 1,850. There were only 9
post graduate degrees awarded in 1983/84 compared with a projection of 66 at



- 27 -
appraisal. Studies of Animal Science graduates indicate that about 50% are
employed by the Government, 40% in the private sector and the rest self
employed.
3.15      Staff Development.  The planned expansion of IAS teaching staff from
34 to 36 and research staff from 38 to 84, was not required because of the
failure to expar.d courses and enrollments as planned. However, the staff
profile showed considerable upgrading from 20 M.S. and 19 Ph.D in 1975/76 to
31 M.S. and 41 Ph.D. in 1982/83. Staff turnover is a problem and a number
have left for employment outside UPLB where salaries are higher.
University of the Philippines - College of Veterinary Medicine (UPCVM)
(Annex 7)
3.16      Organization and Management.  The College is headed by a part-time
Dean assisted by an Associate Dean who has day-to-day administrative responsi-
bility. Since 1979 the Bank has expressed concern over the lack of a full-
time Dean whose undivided attention was thought to be critical for the devel-
opment and relocation of the College from Diliman to UPLB campus.-'  The
College, however, believed that a Dean who holds another key position in the
animal industry has the advantage of wider national perspective.
3.17      Relocation and Integration at UPLB.  The UPCVM was planued to be
transferred in stages from Diliman to the UPLB campus, commencing in 1979, in
order to integrate its work with other academic departments. However, the
delayed completion of the CVM buildings at UPLB has hindered relocation.
Purthermore staff have resisted the move from Manila. The UPCVM has been put
partially under the supervision and administration of the UPLB Chancellor as
an interim arrangement until the college moves, which is now expected to occur
during the period June 1985 through June 1987. i, seems likely however that
part uf the College will remain at Diliman for the next few years.
3.18      Enrollment.  Actual growth in enrnllment from SY1975-76 to SY1980-81
surpassed appraisal projections, but since then there has been a decline due
to UPCVM's deliberate reduction in admissions because of inadequate space and
facilities at the Diliman campus. In addition, the proliferation of veterin-
ary schools in the country has not only reduced the number of applicant /to
the College but has also resulted in some unemployment among graduates.-/
3/   Since the start of the Project, the College Dean has concurrently served
as the Director of the Bureau of Animal Industry, Executive Director of
Livestock Development Council, Deputy Minister of Agriculture Chairman of
the National Meat Inspection Commission and seven other positions. The
Dean was later appointed Minister of Agriculture.
4/   TPAE study on The Assessment of the State of Veterinary Educational
Institution in the Philippines reveals that the number of veterinary
schools has expanded to ten within the last seven years from four during
project appraisal.



- 28 -
3.19       Curricular Changes.  The DVM curriculum has been revised to increase
the emphasis on animal production by approximately doubling the number of
units of these courses from 12 to 20 of the total 155. However, reorienting
the College's thrust towards animal production will require more than these
curricular changes. A more fundamental change in program thrust from domestic
pets to farm animals will have to be vigorously pursued. Also, parallel
changes in staff training, course orientation, clinical practice and research
will have to be undertaken.
3.20       The planned increase in the number of graduate level programs has
not been achieved due to the delays in completion of facitities and in comple-
tion of the overseas training of staff.
3.21       Staff Development.  The number of staff increased by 14 and the
staffing profile improved from one PhD and 11 MS in 1975-76 to 4 PhD and 21 MS
in SY 1983/84.
Staff Development at UPLB (Annex 8)
3.22      The project was designed to strengthen UPLB's staff capability in
teaching, research and extension thiroagh overseas and local fellowships. The
large number of overseas fellowships of UPLB (roughly 236 doctoral and 12
postdoctoral man-years) was implemented with satisfactory results. Seventy-
three of the 110 fellows have obtained their degrees and are currently back at
their posts in UPLB. In addition to the degree fellowships, study tours were
provide, for 9 administrative staff in university administration. Fourteen
PhD fellowships holders have not returned for reasons such as marriage abroad,
postdoctoral grants from other sources.
3.23       In addition to the overseas fellowships, the Government agreed to
train in the Philippines 70 staff of UPLB at the PhD level and abou; 150 at
the MS level. Actually 175 staff were upgraded to MS level and 43 to PhD
during the period 1975 to 1983. The combined overseas and local fellowship
program resulted in an improved staff profile and increased the number of PhD
holders from 163 in SY75/76 to 235 in SY82/83 and MS from 185 to 313. PhD
holders increased from 30% to 32%, and Masters degree holders from 34% to 42%
of the total teaching staff.
Visayas State College of Agriculture (ViSCA) (Annex 9)
3.24       ViSCA starced as a provincial agricultural school and has grown into
a college of 14 academic departments and 6 special centers. It is the center
of excellence in the Visayas region ar.d the strongest agricultural college
outside UP at Los Banos.
3.25      Admission and Enrollment.  The number of freshmen applicants seeking
admission to ViSCA increased (from 616 to 1,575) between 1975 and 5983. The
majority (about 70%) of the applicants were from Eastern Visayas.-   An
5/   4pplicants at ViSCA are no longer required to qusalify in an admission
test. Instead their high school averages and ratings in the National
College Entrance Examination serve as basis for admission, provided they
fall within the standards set by ViSCA.



- 29 -
average of 72% of applicants were admitted annually from 1975 to 1983. Degree
level enrollment expanded from 847 students in SY 1975-76 to 1,444 in 1983-84,
compared with the planned 1,500. MS level courses were started in SY 1979-80
and enrollments rose to 86 in SY 1983-84.
3.26      Graduates.  ViSCA's total output increased from 53 in SY75-76 to 229
in SY83-84, about 28% below the appraisal target.
3.27       Curricular Development.  The expansion of ViSCA's programs in
response to the demand exceeded plans at appraisal. In SY75-76, ViSCA offered
only 6 undergraduate and one technician courses as compared to the current
program of 2 graduate, 8 undergraduate and 2 technician courses. The Bank
expressed concern over the introduction of new programs and specializations
not originally planned. However, the diversification of ViSCA's courses
arises mainly from the different combination of subject rather than from
divisions into narrow specializations.
3.28       Staff Development.  Staff development has proceeded
satisfactorily. The staff has grown from 125 in SY75-76 to the present 192.
Staff qcalifications have improved from 8 PhD and 33 MS holders in SY75-76 to
the 32 PhD and 76 MS holders in SY83-84. ViSCA trained 96 and 5 faculty
members in MS and PhD courses, respectively in local institutions compared
with appraisal targets of 70 and 25.
3.29       Research and Extension.  With support from the Government through
the Philippine Council for Agricultural Resources and Research Department,
ViSCA has made considerable progress with four special research centers - the
Visayas Coordinated Agricultural Research Program, the Philippine Root Crop
Research and Training Center, the Regional Coconut Research Center, and the
Center for Social Research in Small Farmer Development.
3.30      Extension activities have been expanded through the social
laboratory, radio station, publications office and the regional training
center for rural development. The social laboratory covers six harangays
adjacent to ViSCA and 620 farm households have oeen helped through non-formal
training in crop production, and cottage industries ani assisted to form
cooperatives and other programs to increase their income. The laboratory
serves to train students majoring in extension work. The print shop included
in the project is only just becoming operational.
3.31      The ViSCA radio station designed to transmit over a 500 km radius
became operational in August 1982, and was normally on the air for 16 hours, 7
days a week with about 50% of time devoted to agricultural and related top-
ics. The radio station is not operating due to break down of the trans-
mitter. Other operational problems included: (i) lack of funds for acquisi-
tion of spare parts and hiring additional personnel; (ii) defective
installation of facilities; and (iii) inadequate power.
3.32      The Regional Training Center for Rural Development at ViSCA which is
a component of the PTC-RD network complemented the extension programs of ViSCA
by conducting training courses for extension workers and farmers in the
Eastern and Central Visayas.

The Philippine Training Centers for Rural Development (PTC-RD)
3.33      Institutional Support and Development.  Presidential Decree (PD)
1145 issuedMay 1977 formally created the PTC-RD network composed of a
National Training Center (NTC), five Regional Training Centers (RTCs), and six
Farmer Training Centers (FTCs). All the centers have been constructed,
equipped and are in operation. The decree also created the National Governing
Board to establish policies and guidelines, ensure adequate funding, review
budgets and evaluate performance.  The board inclug /s the Chancellor of UPLB,
and the Ministers of the five relevant Ministries.-   Because of difficulties
in convening the board it has delegated pcwer to the Executive Committee, and
to the Executive Director of the National Coordinating Office which serves as
the Board's Secretariat.
3.34      Budgetary support for the PTC-RD was initially provided from alloca-
tions of the five zooperating Ministries, however, because of delays in re-
leases of budget allocation a direct budget appropriation for PTC-RD was
instituted in 1980. Budgetary support however- has been inadequate to support
training operations to full capacity of the centers.
3.35      Staffing and Management.  All the centers are now fully staffed.
The average number of 35 staff per RTC and 25 per FTC is slightly higher than
the planned staffing of 30 for RTCs and 21 for FTCs. Staff turnover because
of low salaries is a problem. Two centers have retained the original
technical staff they started with in 1978, but one other center has completely
changed its staff. The full-time staff are predominantly social science
graduates who organize training programs, while part-time specialists provide
the training.
3.36      Training Programs and Operations.  The original emphasis on social
sciences has been changed and there is now a balance between social and
production technology courses. Courses include the Package of Applicable
Technology, Technical Services Delivery and Program Implementation Manage-
ment.  At appraisal, distinct functions were planned for the two types of
centers, i.e., RTCs to train extension workers and FTCs the farmer leaders.
However the RTCs and FTCs now perform similar functions. The agency officials
and the farmer leaders within each locality are trained as integrated groups
who can later collaborate in the implementation of the plans prepared during
training.
3.37      Training Output.  The training centers were planned to train about
13,650 individuals a year including 100 subject specialists and 50 field
supervisors at NTC, 900 extension workers at each RTC, and 1,500 farm leaders
at each FTC. As planned the course lengths varied as follows: field
supervisor course - six weeks; specialists course - 20 weeks; extension
workers course - four weeks; and farmer leaders course - one week.
6/   The Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Agrarian Reform, Ministry of
Local Government and Community Development, Ministry of Natural Resources
and Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports.



- 31 -
3.38      The first center was completed in late 1978, while most were
completed in late 1979. The NTC was the last center to be completed in
December 1983. Prior to the completion of the buildings, training at a
reduced level was conducted in rented facilities. By 1982, the training
output was closer to the target. but because operating budgets were insuffi-
cient to support full capacity training the duration was reduced to an average
of one week per trainee, i.e. shorter than the appraisal plan.
3.39      A survey of 150 extension workers and 150 farmer leaders who were
trained in 1982 showed increases in farm production after training. According
to the sample of extension workers, production of rice per harvest in their
service area increased by 22%, corn 46%, and livestock an average of 50%.
Farmer leaders reported similar increases. The study estimated the internal
rate of return of such training at 50%.
Industrial Policy Study
3.40      In line with the Governments' effort to improve research capabil-
ities in economic policy areas, the project provided 2 man-years of expert
services to the Philippine Center for Economic Development. A cor.sultant in
the field of Industrial Policy Studies at the UP School of Economics assisted
the Center in research on the relationship of industrial policies to
industrial performance and growth.
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.41      A monitoring and evaluation system for the Project was established
in compliance with Section 3.08 of the Loan Agreement by EDPITAF's Project
Monitoring and Evaluation Division. Regular progress reports were submitted
to the Bank. Towards the end of the project, a tracer study of UPLB and ViSCA
graduates and PTC-RD trainees was commissioned. The study, which surveyed a
sample of graduates of UP's Animal Science, Forestry and Veterinary Medicine
Colleges and ViSCA in 1980/81 and 1981/82, showed that about 80% found work
after 3-4 months of job search. Of those who found jobs, 85% were employed in
work related to their fields of study.
D. PROJECT COSTS
Actual Costs (Annex 10)
4.01      At appraisal the project cost was estimated at about P 339.5 million
(US$45.3 million equivalent) consisting of P 152.0 million (45%) local
counterpart funds and P 187.5 equivalent foreign exchange from the loan (Annex
5.1-A). The actual cost of P 369.1 million exceeded appraisal estimates by
8.7%. In US dollars, however, the actual cost is about 42% below appraisal
estimate due to the devaluation of the peso.

Disbursements (Annex 11)
4.02       The actual rate of disbursement was below the appraisal target.  The
Project suffered from a shortage of funds both for counterpart funds and for
prefinancing of loan financed items. The granting of a two-year project
extension and the greater use of direct payment procedures by the Bank
assisted implementation and disbursement in the closing stages.
4.03       Actual loan disbursement was US$24.9 million and the balance of
US$133,000 was cancelled. Loan funds were reallocated among expenditure cate-
gories, so that actual Bank shares of project costs by category of expenditure
departed slightly from appraisal estimate (Table 4.2).

E. Conclusions and Recommendations from Project Experience
Project Operations
5.01      Project appraisal was conducted in two stages, the first IBRD
mission concentrated on project justification and scope, while the second
mission reviewed architectural sketch plans, equipment lists, costing and
implementation arrangements. Consequently, the project was in an advanced
stage of prepatrtion when the loan was signed. This attempt to lend later in
the project cycle was intended to avoid initial implementati,il problems
previously experienced, such as slow establishment and staffing of project
units, and delay in site acquisition.
5.02      Extension of the closing date was granted in October 1981, much too
close to the project closing date of December 31, 1981 and after the Govern-
ment's annual budget preparation period. 'it was therefore impossible for the
Project Unit to justify a budget for the first year of the extension. In
future projects, extensions should be sought in advance to allow the Project
Unit to negotiate budgetary provisions.
5.03      Despite the institutional competence of UPLB and ViSCA, the devolve-
ment of implementation responsibilities resulted in a hiatus in management.
There was also a lack of clarity over EDPITAF's role and responsibility vis-a-
vis the Bank.
Implementation of Project Support Components
5.04      Civil Works.  The problems and delays in civil works were due to the
lack of provision for price escalation in the contracts.
5.05       Equipment.  Equipment procurement was carried out without major
problems. However, equipment monitoring was generally deficient such that a
number of equipment deficiencies were left unrectified by fully paid contrac-
tors.  In future projects, monitoring should be strengthened at every stage of
the procurement process, including equipment inspection and contract payments.
5.06      Fellowships.  The fellowship program was successful in upgrading
staff in the project institutions. In the majority of cases, the Government
regulation that returning fellows teach for a minimum period of twice the
period spent abroad has been effective., although about 7% of the fellows are
still abroad and may not return.
Outstanding Issues
5.07      University of the Philippines (UPLB-IAS, UPCVM).  The proposed
technican course in animal science, which was to be run jointly by the College
of Veterinary Medicine and the Institute of Animal Science, is being reconsid-
ered. The College of Veterinary Science questions its value because there are
adequate other sources of supply of technicians. Another major issue to be
settled is the relocation of the CVM. The CVM should be located close to the
IAS at Los Banos to facilitate integration as originally planned. However,



- 34 -
because of staff unwillingness to move, discussions of other solutions are
going on. One proposal is to have two campuses - one in Diliman for clinical
practice on domestic pets and the other in Los Bafios for farm animals.
5.08      TPAE.  The TPAE has not had pow'ers to enforce the minimum standards
it has established for agricultural programs. If the proliferation of sub-
standard institutions continues uncontroLled, the quality of agricultural edu-
cation will deteriorate and the number and quality of agricultural graduates
will not match the requirements of the economy. This issue should be dis-
cussed within the Government.
II. BANK OBSERVATIONS
6.01       On the whole, the project achieved the objective of raising the
standard of agricultural training but the supply of well-qualified agricul-
tural manpower was not increased to the extent envisaged at appraisal. The
degree of success varied between components. ViSCA was established as a
regional college of agriculture in the Visayas as planned, as was the national
system of inservice training for rural development staff. The component to
establish centers of excellence in forestry, animal science and veterinary
medicine, however, failed to meet appraisal targets in terms of timing,
enrollments and programs offered. The following observations are related to
the cause ot the deviations and lessons to be drawn for future projects.
Technical Panel for Agricultural Education
6.02       The Government in the completion report comments that the appraisal
team was unrealistic in placing its faith in the TPAE as a means of eliminat-
ing substanrard institutions and controlling enrollment growth. This risk was
identified at appraisal.  According to the Impact Evaluation Report of the
First Education Project,7 the power of the panel lay in its influence on the
central budget allocation, which would be based on the accreditation system
and thus encourage the phasing out of substandard institutions. This did not
materialize because budget allocations were also influenced by political and
other factors. Recognizing this risk, the appraisal report recommended peri-
odic reviews by tha Bank on the performance of the panel. Supervision mis-
sions reviewed TPAE's progress in formulating standards and development plans,
but it was nlot until towards the end of the project that it was evident that
the standards could not be enforced.
6.03       rhe inability of the TPAE in consolidating and controlling the agri-
cultural edtucation system remains the most important outstanding issue. The
Bank is continuing dialogue with the Government on this matter through the
ongoing Fishery Training Project (Ln. 1786-PH). One of the conditions the
Bank is seeking for an extension of the project is clarification of the opera-
tions of the panel.  The Bank has .-ought information on the number of fishery

('n 393-PH), May 6, 1983.

schools in the country and the method by which the panel is controlling the
number of schools and ensuring standards.
Enrollment Tacgets
6.04       The enrollments of the College of Forestry, Insti,ute of Animal
Science and College of Veterinary Medicine at UPLB were below appraisal
estimates. Several factors contributed to this: (a) the TPAE failed to
control the proliferation of agricultural institutions including veterinary
schools, which reduced the number of applicants to the project institutions;
(b) the economic decline in the 1980s caused a general drop in enrollment
throughout the country; and (c) the colleges maintained high admission
standards which limited the pool of qualified applicants.
Project Management
6.05       Changes in management arrangement midway through the project
resulted i-n confusion over responsibility at a crucial time when construction
contracts had to be renegotiated. The cause of the changes was that EDPITAF,
the central implementing agency of MECS, wae due to go out of existence in
1982. Project responsibilities were therefore transferred to the individual
project institutions. However, the decentralization happened too quickly and
institutions were not prepared to take on some of the functions. EDPITAF has
gone through a series of organizational changes since then but has now
stabilized under the new name of PDIMO.
Supervision
6.06      The Government pointed out that more supervision missions in 1978
and 1979, when civil works contracts were beginning to encounter problems,
would have helped project implementation. However, although there was a gap
in supervision during that period due to changes in project responsibility in
the division, it seems unlikely that supervision missions would have prevented
the delays, since the negotiations with contractors and later rebidding on
some contracts were inevitably time-consuming. The pitfall was, in reaction
to the crisis, supervision missions concentrated on implementation of physical
works, to the neglect of the educational aspects. As pointed out by the
Government (para. 2.40), agricultural educators made only four visits during
the project period.
Relocation of the College of Veterinary Medicine
6.07       The college should pursue the re-orientation towards farm animals
rather than domestic pets. With the facilities for clinical practice on farm
animals built at Los Banos, the college should be relocated there. The
proposal to split the campus - one part in Diliman and the other in Los Banios
- would result in inefficiencies and may hinder the re-orientation towards
farm animals. The Bank recently received an informal assurance from the
Deputy Minister of Education in charge of PDIMO that the college would be
relocated at UPLB.



- 36 -
Technician Training
6.08      The project was designed to help the Government achieve a better
balance in the production of various levels and types of agricultural
manpower. However, some of the technician courses planned at appraisal were
not offered. Technician training is fairly new in the Philippines, where
there is a tendency for students to pursue higher degrees. The agricultural
technician programs under the project were not given prominence and were over-
shadowed by the higher education components. The overseas fellowship program
also failed to take into account the need to train staff to teach -he
technician courses. Thus when the staff returned, they were not prepared to
teach the courses. The Government has since then continued efforts to develop
technician training. It has recently launched two projects assisted by ADB
focussing on technician training in engineering and agriculture.
Fellowships vs. Specialist Services
6.09       The reallocation of loan funds from specialist services to fellow-
ships indicates the Philippine preference for technical assistance in the form
of overseas training for their staff rather than specialist services. One
reason is that institutions have difficulty in recruiting leading foreign
experts and often resort to the employment of less experienced expatriates.
The benefits of overseas training are thus considered higher. This preference
is manifest in other education projects in the Philippines.
