                         except in the case of network applications which are managed centrally but extend to the Local Government Authorities. The other Development Partners are DFID, CIDA and
                         DANIDA. DFID and CIDA have extended their to the PSRP support till June 2014.This is the final ISR for the PRAP prior to Project Closing on December 31, 2012. It is based on the
                         results reported by the government till November 30, 2012. Since the formal reporting of results is done on a quarterly basis an interim report for the quarter was requested and was
                         kindly agreed to by the government.

                         The positive trend identified in the previous ISR, subsequent to restructuring of the project in April 2012, has continued with significant achievements in the following sub-components:

                         Records Management: Records management has consistently become better over the project period. One indicator of efficiency is the time taken to retrieve records. The average
                         retrieval time for a record has reduced from 18 minutes in 2006 to 10 minutes as was targeted. The lowest retrieval time in select locations is 5 minutes. This is a result of
                         decongestion of personnel and subject records, provision of appropriate storage and skills enhancement of staff. Construction of the archives (National Records Center at Dodoma)
                         has been completed and the site will be handed back to the government from the contractor on December 15, 2012. Equipment and furniture has been procured and is being
                         transported to Dodoma to make the archive operational before December 31, 2012. The capacity of the archives has been enhanced from 200,000 to 700,000 records.

                         Integrated HCMIS linked to Payroll: The upgraded Integrated Payroll System which is linked to the Human Capital Management Information System (HCMIS) has been rolled out to
                         405 Ministries, Departments and Agencies which includes 29 ministries and 126 Local Government Authorities. The results are very encouraging. This has become a case study of
                         successful PSR/PFM reform profiled by PRMPS. The benefits accruing from this intervention are (1) Enhanced staffing of service delivery staff in hard to staff areas. The average
                         Pupil to Teacher Ratio (PTR) declined in Tanzania by 4% since 2011 but in a remote district like Kibondo (which is 1300 kilometers from Dar es Salaam) the PTR declined by 13%
                         with an increase in the number of teachers from 1467 to 1670. Prior to the introduction of this system, staff in remote areas found it very difficult to get their salaries adjusted and had
                         to make repeated visits to Dar for the purpose. With the introduction of this system updation of records was decentralized to Accounting Officers which reduced the backlog. New
                         appointees get their salary in the first month of their joining instead of after a lag of upto seven months as previously. (2) The efficiency of the new system is also evident from the
                         sharp decrease in salary arrears from Tsh 43.8 billion (15% of the average monthly expenditure on salary) in January 2012 to Tsh3.5 billion in November 2012 (3) The financial return
                         on this investment is highly satisfactory. Against an investment of USD 1.9 million in equipment and training, the savings from just one month of avoided salary of the 13,815 "ghosts"
                         detected by the system is USD 1 million giving a pay back period of just two months. The integrated HCMIS and payroll also facilitates better workforce management and training by
                         providing customized information on the workforce profile.

                         Public service Pay and Incentives: The Strategy Paper to implement the new Pay and Incentives Policy is with the cabinet for approval. The government has identified 33 districts as
                         hard-to-serve and proposes to provide financial and non financial incentives to staff to work in these districts. It will also rationalize allowances resulting in better management of the
                         fiscal impact of salaries.

                         e-governance: The e-government portal <www.egov.go.tz> is ready and provides access to three e-governance services; the government directory; business registration and land
                         records. A dissemination strategy is being implemented to make citizens aware of these facilities. The e-government agency is operational and is integrating the ICT related work in
                         service delivery.

                         Gender Responsiveness: The program to support women government officials to gain their Masters degrees is being continued. A Tracer Study conducted in August 2012 shows that
                         65% of those who attained their masters degrees have been promoted to the Manager cadre which signals the effectiveness of this strategy to empower women in government. A

                         supporting activity to create a network of women mentors from those occupying leadership positions will be continued under the Public Service Reform Program of the government
                         which continues till June 2014.

                         Monitoring PRAP Performance Management: The government has significantly improved the monitoring of results. Results are now available for all four PDO indicators and all
                         eighteen Intermediate Indicators of PRAP.

                         Project management: Project management has improved significantly. The Work plan for 2012-13 was prepared by May 2012 and approved in June 2012 well in time for the start of
                         the new fiscal. The related Procurement Plan was prepared by September 2012 and approved in the same month, coinciding with the release of funds from treasury for the new
                         fiscal. In 2011-12 the completion rate of activities was over 90% as compared to around 60% earlier. Project activities have been substantively completed in all the sub components
                         or are at a stage of near completion within the target date of December 31, 2012.

                         Financial management: There has been significant improvement in financial management. Interim Financial reports are now being received on time within one month of the
                         completion of every quarter. The government even responded to the request of an interim IFR as of end November 2012 to facilitate disbursement of the remaining USD 2.93 million
                         which is now being processed. As of November 30, 2012 against the cumulative disbursement of USD 27.55 million, utilization of 93% of the amount has been accounted for.
