                         The restructuring (i) revised the Project Development Objective in order to align it more closely with the revised and reduced scope of the underlying Public Service Reform Program-
                         II of the recipient, which the Project co-finances (ii) revised the number of components from seven to four and reduced the number of activities to only those which could be
                         completed by the Project closing date on December 31, 2012, (iii) canceled SDR6.5 million (US$10 million equivalent) out of the undisbursed credit amount of SDR13.65 million (US
                         $20.5 million equivalent), and (iv) terminated the Adaptable Program Loan arrangements as no longer applicable given the significant changes in the scope of the program. The
                         Environmental Assessment category of the project is “B? and is not expected to change.

                         The effects of the restructuring are immediately visible in the results achieved by June 2012:

                         Records Management: Records management has been made more efficient in all Ministries, Agencies and Departments. the average retrieval time for a record is now down to 11
                         minutes from the level of 15 minutes in 2009-10. Both personnel and subject records have been decongested and the staff trained in upgraded records management. Construction
                         of the archives (National Records Center at Dodoma) has been completed. Equipment and furniture is being procured to make the archive operational before December 31, 2012.
                         This will enhance the capacity of the archives from 200,000 to 700,000 records.

                         HCMIS: The upgraded Human Capital Management Information System (HCMIS) has been rolled out to 347 MDAs and LGAs which includes 29 ministries and 126 Local
                         Government Authorities. The results are very encouraging. The savings accrued till June 2012 amounted to more than USD 7 million on account of weeding out of 18, 542 "ghosts"
                         and reduction of incorrect payments. The pay back rate on this investment is less than one year. (Expenses of USD 2 million with a savings of over USD 7 million in the first year of
                         implementation). New appointees get their salary in the first month of their joining instead of after a lag of upto seven months as previously. The integrated HCMIS and payroll also
                         facilitates better workforce management and training by providing customized information on the workforce profile. Till now only six of the thirteen modules have been operationalized
                         and training is ongoing for staff to operationalize all thirteen modules.

                         Public service Pay and Incentives: The Strategy Paper to implement the new Pay and Incentives Policy has been prepared by the POPSM. It is expected to be approved within
                         2012-13. This will serve to rationalize allowances; provide financial and non financial incentives to staff for working in hard to serve areas leading to rationalized distribution of the
                         work force and better management of the fiscal impact of salaries.

                         e-governance: The e-government portal <www.egov.go.tz> is ready and provides access to three e-governance services; the government directory; business registration and land
                         records. A dissemination strategy is being implemented to make citizens aware of these facilities. Availability of the portal and use of the facilities will be monitored in real time and
                         reported monthly from October 2012. The e-government agency has been set up and is expected to be operational in 2012-13.

                         Gender Responsiveness: The program to support women government officials to gain their Masters degrees is being continued. A Tracer Study conducted in August 2012 shows that
                         65% of those which attained their masters degrees have been promoted to the Manager cadre which signals the effectiveness if this strategy to empower women in government. A
                         supporting activity to create a network of women mentors from those occupying leadership positions is underway.

                         Monitoring Performance Management: The government has significantly improved the monitoring of results. Results are now available for all four PDO indicators and sixteen of the
                         eighteen Intermediate Indicators with surveys ongoing for the remaining two.

                         Project management: Project management has improved significantly. The Work plan for 2012-13 was prepared by May 2012 and approved in June 2012 well in time for the start of
                         the new fiscal. The related Procurement Plan was prepared by September 2012 and approved in the same month coinciding with the release of funds from treasury for the new fiscal.
                         In 2011-12 the completion rate of activities was over 90% as compared to around 60% earlier. Project activities in Zanzibar have also commenced under the restructured project and
                         are expected to be completed by December 31, 2012. Base level indicators in Zanzibar have also been assessed for referencing achievements.

                         Financial management: There has been significant improvement in financial management. Interim Financial reports are now being received on time and are made per the agreed

                         Procurement Management: The audit of Procurement Records relating to 2010-11 was received from PPRA in June 2012. No major comments were made by Audit and POPSM is
                         following up on all the recommendations for enhancing efficiency in Procurement. It has also taken a Procurement Specialist on deputation from PPRA to enhance capacity after the
                         demise of the head of the Procurement Unit in the previous fiscal.
