LOWER PIURA IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT II
(LOAN 1771-PE)
PREFACE
1.       This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Lower Piura
Irrigation Rehabilitation Project II in Peru, for which Loan No. 1771-PE
in the amount of US$56.0 million was approved on November 26, 1979. Al-
though the loan was closed on June 30, 1987, disbursements to Peru were
suspended on May 5, 1987 for non-payment of arrears.
2.       Formal closing of the Project has been precluded pending receipt
of documentation justifying the remaining balance in the loan Special
Account.   The Bank has requested that GOP either -eturn the funds or
provide the appropriate documentation.
3.       The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operatioius Division of the
Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office and is based inter alia, on
the Draf Completion Report prepared by the Borrower, progress reports of
the Project Unit (P.U.), the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan, Guarantee,
and Project Agreements, supervision reports, correspondence between the
Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda. A Completion Mission
to Peru was not undertaken.
4.       This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and the Cofinancier for comments on
March 2, 1990. Comments received from ENERGOPROJEKT are attached to the
Report as Annex 3.

PROJECT COWLT!ON REPORT

(LOAN 1771-PE)
EVALUATION SFMMAUY
A. Introduction and Obiectives
1.       The Irrigation Rehabilitation Project II was a further phase in
the Government of Peru's sectoral program to dev;lop and rehabilitate
irrigated coastal areas where the potential for increased agricultural
production is great and the basic infrastructure already exists.
2.       The objective of this project was to increase agricultural
production and productivity on 34,700 irri-able hectares and raise the
incomes of about 11,800 cooperative and smallholder families in the Lower
Piura Valley.  This was to be achieved througk  onstruction and
rehabilitation of irrigation works, completion -,? surface and sub-surface
drainage systems. land levelling and reclamation of saline lands, flood
protection works, provision of agricultural extension, and medium and
long-term investment credit. Studies for a third phase were also included.
B.  ImDlementation Exverienc -
3.       Project implementation was affected from the outset by
complexities of design and coordination, management upheavals in the
Project Unit, counterpart funding constraints. the floods of 1983 and slow
progress of the cradit component. The floods seriously damaged major civil
-orks nearing completion causing financial difficulties for ENERGOPROJECT,
the principal contractor and cofinancier, and the Borrower. However, the
Bank responded promptly and effectively to the 1983 disaster re-dirc_ting
funds to reconstruction and adjusting targets during implementation. By
late 1985 recovery was impressive and overall implementation satisfactory,
with the exception of on-farm development. The five year project was
comple-id 1 in seven with a minimal cost overrun (Chapter II1. and Annex
I) .
C. Results
4.       The Project was a qualified success, meeting or potentially
fulfilling most of its appraisal targets, but in some cases with
coxsiderable delay. The major deficiency was on-farm development which
progressed unevenly due to budget shortages, creditworthiness problems
especially among cooperatives, and poor demand for sub-loans (paras.
3.18-3.24).
5.       Agricultural production in key crops (rice, cotton, corn and
sorghum) showed satisfactory, and at times. exceptional results.
Production advances were set back principally by poor on-farm development
which contributed to continuing salinity problems on about half the project
area. Realistically, full development of agricultural production is
unlikely before the early 1990's but, based on results already achieved,
could eventually surpass appraisal estimates (paras. 4.2-4.15).

6.       Despite management upheavals, the Project Unit (DEPECHP) achieved
its institutional goals, developing comprehensive experience and expertise.
A fortified extension service was rewarded with good results from the more
advanced small farmers but had negligible effect on those at the lowest
levels (paras. 3.27-3.31)
7.       Despite sustained efforts by the Banik and DEPECHP. farmers
continued at Project's end to pay only nominal water charges with
commensurate implications for future operation and maintenance (O&M), cost
recovery and the viability of Water User Associations (paras. 5.10-5.18).
D. Sustainability
A.       Project sustainabillty depends heavily on:  (a) payment of water
charges sufficient to cover O&M costs; (b) sufficient funding to support
and boost agricultural extension; and (c) completion of on-farm irrigation
and drainage works without which the Project's agricultural prodtvction and
income goals over the full extent of the project area cannot materialize.
9.       Bank-initiated agreements were finally signed in 1987 to ensure
institutional continuity for O&M and extension. Modest hridging funds were
earmarked by the GOP pending settlement of the US$10 million flood
insurance claim from 1983. Settlement has recently occurred and the first
instalment of US$.0 million was deposited by the GOP in the Loan Account
in accordance with the Loan Agreement. Further progress has also been made
towards completing on-farm works (Annex 1).
E. Lessons Learned
10.      The following lessons could prove useful for similar future
projects:
(a) Despite problems, the project succeeded through the dedication of
the Project Unit supported by frequent Bank supervision,
demonstrating its a'-opriateness as a vehicle for transferring
lasting benefits, but one requiring a priori, a strong commitment
from the Borrower.
(b) The pressures of project planning deadlines can adversely affect
the perception of potential problems, depth of preparation and
setting of reali.-tic targets, leading to implementation delays.
(c)  Project pieparation failed to involve or fully understand
beneficiaries, leading to over-optimistic projections for the
credit and on-farm irrigation components.
(d) A more effective Monitoring and Evaluation System might have
mitigated such failures at an earlier stage.
(e) Appraisal should have foreseen the practical and legal impediments
to adequate cost recovery, requiring a more forceful approach to
covenant design and maintenance.
(f) The project justifiably included funds for preparation of follow-
on operations, since precluded by national economic and political
turmoil.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PERU
LOVER PIURA IRRIGATION REhARILITATION PROJECT It
(LOAN 1771-PE)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      Agriculture plays an important role in the economy of Peru
occupying some 402 of the labor force yet contributing only 152 to GDP.
Agricultural output e-'d especially food production has lagged population
growth for well over 20 years.
1.2      Of a total of 3.6 million ha of cropland, about 1.0 million ha are
potentially irrigable, of which 770,000 ha are located in 52 valleys in the
coastal zone. This region produces around two-thirds of Peru's
agricultural output under irid conditions which require irrigation.
1.3      Many of the existing coastal irrige.tion schemes were
privately-built on large estates some 40 to 50 years ago but subsequentlv
deteriorated because of a lack of regional investment and management
capability. Excess irrigation in the upper valleys and poor drainage below
caused progressive salinization, decreasing yields and reducing the area
cultivated.
1.4      Following the introduction of the Government's ambitious Agrarian
Reform Program in 1969, private investment in agriculture declined with
commensurate effects on coastal irrigation systems, which deteriorated
further. Facing the problem of scarce land, rapid population growth and
increasing dependence on imported foods, the GOP initiated a national
program of rehabilitating existing irrigation and drainage systems in the
coastal region in preference to investing in costly new schemes.
1.5      At appraisal only 27,400 ha out of the 34,700 ha project area were
under cultivation, with a cropping intensity of 106Z. Pima cotton was the
main crop on 21,000 ha with corn, sorghum and rice on 3,300 ha and pasture
and subsistence crops on 4,700 ha. Average yields were low due to
deteriorated infrastructure, inadequate techtical assistance and reduced
production credit. The SAR estimated annual income per family as US$1,784
for cooperative members, mostly derived :,n-farm, and US$1,272 for
minifundistas 1 of which some 45Z was from seasonal off-farm employment.2
1/  Very small holdings of 0-5 ha.  SAR also included communal cooperatives
and peasant groups, under this title. Together, they formed the
Project's chief target population.
2/  SAR income figures seem unrealistically high.  The President's Report
(2642-PE) of November 6, 1979 gives per capita fig,ures of US$180 p.a.
for farmers working less than 5 ha of which US$100 p.a. derived off-
farm. Extrapolation to a per family basis (i.e., with several
productive members) would still not produce SAR estimates.



- 2 -
1.6      In keeping with its policy of setting up semi-autonomous units to
manage and implement large projects, the Ministry of Agriculture
established DEPECHP, the Chira-Piura Special Project, in 1970. Before its
management of 1771-PE, DEPECHP was responsible for the construction of
other major hydraulic works in the region including the Poechos dam, and
was becoming increasingly involved with agricultural development. The
second project broadened and consolidated its institutional role in the
area.
II.  PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Identification and Preparation
2.1      A feasibility study to develop the Chira-Piura valleys was carried
out in 1968 by the International Engineering Company (IECO) USA, with Bank
finance. Political conditions in Peru at the time precluded the Bank from
financing a project. The GOP proceeded independently and with Yugoslavian
(ENERGO) finance, constructed the Poechos storage dam, the Chira-Piura
diversion canal and the main drainage networks in the Lower Piura Valley.
2.2      In 1976, the Bank appraised the first Irrigation Rehabilitation
Project (Loan 1403-PE) for US$25.0 million, which closed in December 1985.
Feasibility studies for the second phase were prepared by a local Peruvian
consortium with support from the FAO/CP. Due to limited Peruvian
experience with large irrigation schemes, a high FAO/CP input was required
to get an acceptable study for appraisal.
2.3      The follow-on project (Loan 1771-PE) would rehabilitate irrigation
works and reclaim salinized lands in the Lower Piura Valley, with the goal
of increasing the agricultural productivity and incomes of 11,800 families,
most of which were at or below relative poverty. Several new elements were
included in Stage II: a) a construction company (ENERGO) was scheduled to
tinalize design prior to implementation; b) a component was added to
strengthen and finance agricultural extension; c) on the job and overseas
training was funded for local staff on all project-related matters.
especially agriculture, and the operation and maintenance (O&H) of
irrigation and drainage systems.
B. Apuraisal and Negotiations
2.4      The Project was appraised by the Bank in November 1978 and
February 1979, negotiated in September 1979 and approved by the Board in
November 1979.
2.5      An early, pre-appraisal mission in August 1976 noted the potential
for special difficulties with Project II stemming from: (a) a new, dynamic
hydraulic situation following construction of the Poechos Dam and main
diversion canal, exacerbating the overall salinity problem due to increased
water volume and con-.inued poor drainage; (b) another foreign financing
agent (ENERGO) already in the area; and (c' a pre-existing aspecial
project' entity in the Lower Piura Valley (DEPECHP).



2.6      A follow-up mission in February 1979 explored the feasibility of
cost-effective manual labor for secondary and tertiary canals and drainage,
and warned of the need for high quality supervisivn from contractors and
the Project Unit, a phased approach to design and implementation, and the
importance of a regular flow of funds.
2.7      Negotiations secured assurances from t1e GOP on important aspects
including: (a) the implementation of realistic    er charges and
establishment of of-; -b) setting-up of the creuit component with BAP, upon
which loan effect  4tLe-. hinged; (c) role and responsibilities of DEPECHP;
(d) periodic revi ,    adjustment of sub-loan interest rates; and (e)
support for agricu_t.xl: extension.  The Loan Committee limited its
comments to the ju.isdictional relationship between Peru and Ecuador over
the Poechos Dam.
2.8      Almost one year elapsed between initial appraisal and Board
presentation because of incomplete co-financing arrangements between the
GOP and ENERGO, and the need for caution dictated by Peru's severe economic
difficulties and questions about creditworthiness. Principal risks
foreseen by the Board included: (a) construction delays due to right of
way conditions and ongoing farmer operations in areas subject to irrigation
and drainage works; and (b) failure to retain qualified staff for the
extension service due to low salaries.
2.9      As it turned out, the first concern was valid and targets for
on-farm drainage construction were sharply reduced to make use of existing
structures, one important reason being the avoidance of interruption to
farmers' urgent, on-going needs for water.  In the case of b), the
extension service was understaffed especially in the later stages of the
Project, but attrition was not the cause.
C. Proiect Objectives
2.10     The objectives of the project were:  (a) to increase agricultural
production and productivity on 34,700 Ha in the Lower Piura Valley; and
(b) raise the incomes of about 11,800 families with the emphasis on small
farmers and cooperative members. This would be accomplished through:
(i) rehabilitation of irrigation facilities; (ii) completion of drainage
networks; (iii) reclamation of saline soils; (iv) protection against
floods; and (v) provision of technical assistance and equipment.
D. Prolect Descrintion
2.11     The Project was to consist of:
Part (a)  irrigation works, including (i) construction of a diversion dam
on the Piura River; (ii) construction and lining of a 40 km main
irrigation canal; (iii) rehabilitation and lining of 112.1 km of
secondary and 77.9 km of tertiary canals and rehabilitation of
1,170 km of lateral and sublateral canals; (iv) construction of
administrative buildings for the irrigation district; and (v)
consulting services for engineering and supervision of these
works;



- 4 -
Part (b)  drainage works, including construction of 15 km of main drains,
415 km of collector drains and 1,070 km of field drains;
Part (c) flood protection works, including Ci) improvement of 12.3 km of
flood protection dikes; (ii) construction of 54.1 km of new dikes
along both banks of the Piura River; and (iii) realignment of
some stretches of the river;
Part (d)  development credit for land levelling, irrigation ditches, soil
leaching and improvements, and other on-farm investments;
Part {e)  equipment, including maintenance and office equipment, vehicles
for land reclamation and extension services, and a soils and
water analysis laboratory;
Part (f)  technical services, including (i) strengthening and expansion of
the agricultural extension and research services, with special
emphasis on assistance to small-farmers; Cii) establishment of a
land reclamation service; and (iii) training of Peruvian
technicians abroad; and
Part (g)  consultant services to (i) assist the project executing authority
in project design, construction and provision of technical
services; and (ii) carry out feasibility studies for subsequent
rehabilitation projects.
E. Proiect Costs and Financing
2.12     In 1978, total project costs were estimated at UJS$178.8 million
with the Loan providing US$56.0 million (31.3?), the GOP US$74.5 million
(41.62) ENERGO US$46.4 million (26?) and project beneficiaries US$1.9
million (1.12). Actual total project cost at completion showed a modest
overrun of US$4.07 million principally due to: (a) the floods of 1983,
which necessitated major reconstruction and repair to principal and
secondary works near completion; and (b) the decision in 1980 by DEPECHP to
relocate the site of the main d.version dam 18 km. upstream to Los Ejidos,
adding about US$5.0 million to GOP/ENERGO financed components. The Bank
shortfall resulted mainly from the suspension of disbursements in May 1987
for non-payment of arrears by the GOP. The Borrower shortfall was
ultimately minimal, though intermittent but serious counterpart funding
difficulties dogged the Project, with particular impact on the credit
component.
2.13     Of the final cost of US$182.87 million, the Loan financed US$53.03
million (29Z), the GOP US$74.31 million (41Z) and ENERGO US$55.53 (30?)
(See Annex II, Tables 1 and 2).



III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Proiect Effectiveness and Start-up
3.1      Project effectiveness was delayed until May 1980, following Board
approval in November 1979 because of the need to secure an agreement
between DEPECHP and BAP for carrying out the credit component, and
continued lack of an executed agreement between GOP and ENERGO for
co-financing the principal works.
3.2      Progress in the first year was slow with evidence of technical
difficulties and uneven implementation emerging early on because of:
(a) political pressure on DEPECHP to reconsider the design and location of
the main diversion dam; (b) serious differences of opinion over design and
construction of flood control works; (c) incomplete feasibility studies;
(d) Borrower technical inexperience; and (e) management problems in the
Project Unit.
3.3      It became evident that Project implementation would benefit from
the supervision of an experienced consulting firm and the ISL Consortium
was retained. Counterpart funding deficiencies emerged which were
aggravated in 1982 by a GOP budget contraction of 20% with negative
effects, especially on the credit component. By the end of 1982,
disbursements were only 42Z of appraisal.
B. Implementation
3.4      Project execution took seven years instead of the planned five
mainly due to start-up delays and the after-effects of the 1983 floods.
Principal events by component were as follows:
Irriaation Works
3.5      The Project successfully completed all major irrigation works
foreseen at appraisal or subsequently amended to take account of changed
circumstances, but on-farm irrigation works, especially those requiring
private investment, did not fare so well.
3.6      Under pressure from ODENORTE, the Borrower's regional entity,
DEPECHP decided at the outset to reconsider the location and design of the
main diversion dam on the Piura River, to be financed under bilateral
arrangements with ENERGO. The site was moved 17 km upstream from Catacaos,
to Los Ejidos. Bank staff supported the decision and its rationale
(safety, health and socio/political reasons) but warned of delays, cost
overruns and the possible need for additional financing.
3.7      Incremental costs associated with relocating the dam and
constructing the additional 17 km of canals were around US$5.0 million,
held down by cost savings on modifications to flood protection dikes and
other works, also ENERGO financed. Construction of the dam proceeded
almost one year over schedule and was 95% complete by the end of 1982
(start of El Nino floods). The relocation and additional 17 km of canal
brought under irrigation an added 3,000 ha over the appraised target.



3.8      Rehabilitation and lining of secondary and tertiary canals and
rehabilitation of lateral and sub-lateral canals, an important prerequisite
for the Project's overall on-farm development goals, progressed slowly,
especially on cooperative land, due to counterpart funding shorta£es,
farmer indebtedness and lack of interest in credit, flood effects after
1983, and inferior performance by local contractors. Targets for both
categories were substantially reduced because of difficulties arising from
fragmented land tenure, right of way problems and econom.ic conditions
requiring the use of existing canals. More importantly in the case of
lateral and sub-lateral canals, farmers had pressing need for ongoing
supplies of water, a situation forewarned at Board presentation.
3.9      Secondary and tertiary canals reached 87% of their revised target
while lateral and sub-lateral canals did poorly, achieving only 37Z of a
drastically reduced target. Small farmers fared better than cooperatives
chiefly because cooperative indebtedness inhibited BAP lending.
3.10     Construction of buildings for the irrigation district was reduced
from 2,900 sq.m. to 160 through better use of existing facilities.
Drainage Works
3.11     The Loan covered all drainage works on public land.  On
individually-owned farms, it paid for collector, secondary and field
drains, with other on-farm development (ditches, levelling, subsoiling) at
farmer expense, assisted by BAP credit. For cooperatives, the Loan
provided design and supervision assistance for all on-farm works, and paid
for collector drains. Secondary and field drains as well as other
development were at cooperative expense throuLA BAP loans.
3.12     It had been assumed at appraisal that all drainage would be at
State expense regardless of land ownership. However, a BAP/IDB loan
program for cooperative drainage works was already active in the area and
the Loan Agreement was amended (at GOP request) in 1980 to bring the
Project cost recovery policy into line with existing programs.
Cooperatives were therefore obliged to take loans with BAP which were
substantially greater per hectare than for average, individually-owned
farms (US$1,400 and US$600 respectively). As things turned out, this
decision proved to be a setback for the irrigation component in view of the
reluctance of BAP to lend to the cooperatives (para. 3.20 below).
3.13     The drainage component progressed unevenly and final results were
well short of target. The notable exception was the successful
rehabilitation of 175.0 km (108X of revised target) of secondary drains as
a result of project changes in 1984, which downgraded the role of main
drains and introduced a new target for the rehabilitation of 210 km of
existing secondary drainage channels (see Table 4.1). Small farmers did
better than cooperatives, which were hampered by creditworthiness and
managerial problems.
3.14     More generally, farmer enthusiasm for on-farm e ainage investment
was low due to traditional attitudes to debt, lack of faith in Project
benefits, and, after the 1983 floods, the inability of much of the drainage



-7-
system to receive and conduct accumulated drainage water due to
sedimentation and lack of maintenance. DEPECHP lacked the funds and
equipment to maintain collector drains and responsibility for clearing
secondary drains was a "gray" area resulting in little action at all.
Progress on the drainage component was also hampered by perennial
counterpart funding constraints, and until the Bank urged DEPECHP action in
late 1982, a lack of well-defined soil, drainage and levelling data that
would permit better design, lending and contracting activities.
3.15     The SAR cited varying salinization on about 782 of total project
area, with the remaining 222 highly salinized and out of production. By
early 1986, serious continuing salinity on over 502 of the project area was
described as "the main constraint to overall agricultural development" 3
requiring long-term effort and urgent construction, completion and
maintenance of a drainage system. These recomnendations led to an
extensive and successful pilot program of drainage rehabilitation to clear
and re-shape about 40 km of main drains with a parallel effort by farmers,
through Water User Associations, in financing and labor for the
rehabilitation of 35 km. of collector drains. BAP credit (initially for
one crop season) reimbursed farmers or User Associations against
certificates issued by the project upon completion of the work. Equipment
was supplied by the Association. Initial targets were exceeded and similar
programs were planned for 1988 with modest budgets, pending settlement of a
1983 insurance claim. 4
Flood Protection
3.16     Flood control works were completed in accordance with original or
amended targets. This included repair and re-design of flood-damaged
dikes, almost complete by 1982, and the subsequent addition of protection
groins against erosion. The reconstruction plan called for Bank financing
of additional flood works just outside the immediate project confines but
progress was slow due to shortage of funds and only some emergency work was
completed.
3.17     Aspects of the designs for the original flood protection plan
caused serious disagreement early in 1980, covering, among other issues,
the methodology used to estimate flood flows and the location if the
emergency spillway on the original dam at Catacaos. Bank specialist staff
made recommendations for re-design but these were not heeded. DEPECHP's
subsequent decision to relocate the main dam resolved the matter by
requiring overall design changes satisfactory to the Bank. This situation,
however, underlines the element of risk in initiating complex technical
projects where Borrower expertise and experience is lacking and basic
designs, procedures and institutional support are still being formulated
and established as the project gets underway.
3/ H. Auffret, Special Supervision Mission, 1986.
4/ The insurance claim has recently been settled after years of effort by
the Bank, including submissions to the highest Peruvian authorities. A
compromise was achieved resulting in the reimbursement of US$10.0
million which has been deposited in the Loan Account as per the Loan
Agreement (see also Annex I).



- 8 -
Development Credit and On-Farm Investment
3.18     The credit component for on-farm investment disbursed barely 17Z
of its original target of US$5.9 million with especially poor results for
cooperatives, for whom over half of the credit was intended.
3.19     The Project was to provide medium and long-term sub-loans through
the BAP at 33Z p.a. to small farmers and cooperatives, on the basis of
development plans submitted by DEPECHP. BAP would also provide incremental
short-term production credit to all project beneficiaries. The signing of
an agreement between the Ministry of Agriculture and BAP for provision of
the above was a condition of loan effectiveness.
3.20     Within a short time of loan approval it became clear that poor
creditworthiness, especially in the cooperatives, would be a serious
constraint on the credit componernt. By June 1982, a Bank mission described
the cooperatives' "poor administration, lack of understanding of, or
interest in, the cooperative as a business, low productive efficiency and
high unit cost,' as a powerful disincentive to BAP lending.
3.21     This perception, combined with a deteriorating country situation
and rising interest rates caused BAP to apply stringent sub-loan approval
criteria which inhibited DEPECHP's best efforts to formulate and process
farm development plans (See Table 5.1). Plans for 13,050 ha (67Z) were
submitted. The BAP approved onLy 7,070 ha (57Z) for small farmers and 447
ha (6Z) for cooperatives. Overall progress was only 38.6Z of target.
3.22     A number of other factors contributed to this result.  Counterpart
funding problems surfaced in 1981 and were made worse in 1982 by a GOP
budget contraction of 20Z. The El Nino floods of 1983 not only exacerbated
the budget crisis but also caused sedimentation of the drainage network.
This compounded by a lack of maintenance by DEPECHP and the Water User
Association, acted as a further deterrent to investment.
3.23     More important, farmers, especially cooperatives, were not in fact
interested in using c.,edit or carrying out on-farm works. Project goals
were not understood due to a lack of beneficiary involvement from the early
planning stages and inconsistent promotion thereafter, and the  appraisal
had paid no heed to traditional peasant attitudes to debt.  It is certain,
in any case, that a high proportion of the very small farmers, despite
being the Project's target population, could not realistically qualify for
credit and were never expected to do so.
3.24     Successive supervision missions stressed the responsibility of
DEPECHP and the extension service to promote project goals. Mission staff
suggested different guidelines for BAP sub-loan evaluation. By 1985,
limited project funds and the BAP requirement that all farmers settle
pre-existing debt, much of it production credit from the flood period,
virtually shut down credit approval. By the end of 1986, acting on the



-9-
recommendations of the Auffrett report5 the Bank urged the BAP to review
the cooperatives' financial situation, and in fact 80X were found to be
creditworthy. However, disillusionment with BAP suppressed further
meaningful demand for its loans, and in December Loan 2302-PE (Agricultural
Credit) was suspended principally for failure to meet interest rate
covenants. This killed any remaining chance of meeting project goals in
the credit component.
EauiDment
3.25     The loan provided US$5.3 million for purchase of maintenance
equipment, vehicles, specialized technical equipment, pipes for drainage
construction, and the setting-up of a soil and water analysis laboratory.
The loan amount for this component was reduced in 1986 to US$4.1 million,
of which 102% was disbursed. A soils and water laboratory was established
by DEPECHP. Some additional equipment had to be purchased for flood
reconstruction but mostly it was diverted from other activities and
agencies. The Auffrett report of 1986 noted shortages of vehicles for the
extension service as a serious constraint on its training and visit system.
Aaricultural Research
3.26     Under cont-actual arrangements between DEPECHP and INIA, (later
INIPA) research adv.nced rapidly with the already-established experimental
plots at Pedregal and Montegrande upgrading their activities to include
applied research on cotton, corn, sorghum, beans and soybeans, followed by
the development and continuous review thereafter, of livestock, joint
cropping and pest control packages complemented by I and D research at the
Chira Research Station. Thus production-oriented research and its link to
extension were strengthened, with evidence of good implementation rates
among the more successful small farmers. The real potential of extension
to foster better yields is shown in a comparison of demonstration plot
results versus actual average results for the project area in 1987. (See
Annex II, Table 3).
Extensiot Services
3.27     Extensionists' responsibilities were broad and included technology
dissemination through a variety of means including T&V, audiovisual
courses, demonstration plots and the contact farmer system (agricultores de
enlace); preparation of farm development plans for credit applications;
promotion and assistance for on-farm works including drainage, land
levelling and reclamation; irrigation counselling; and soil salinity and
texture classifications aimed at more intensive land use.
3.28     The agricultural extension component brought major benefits to the
more advanced farmers but had only modest effects on very small producers.
5/ H. Auffrett, Special Supervision Mission, April 1986 report, "Lower
Piura Irrigation Project: Agro-Economic Aspects."



- 10 -
Implementation was slow for several years due to DEPECHP management
relegating extension to a secondary position and inadequate budget
commitment from the Ministry of Agriculture.  The pivotal tri  i.ng and
visit system was without vehicles until April 1982; audio vi .. training
did not commence until 1983 and demonstration plots were not itr.roduced
until 1986.
3.29     The extensionists' task was complicated by a GOP census in 1980
which revealed that the number of potential beneficiary families in the
project area was almost three times higher than appraised (31,200 families
cf. 11,800), with minifundistas almost four times higher (26,050 cf.
7,500). The resulting extensionisttfarmer ratio of over 1:1,000 was
unacceptably high for the efficient delivery of assistance to all targeted
beneficiaries.6
3.30     The smallness of individual plots, the grouping of farmers into
villages and the use of the "enlace' system might have mitigated the
potential effects of such a ratio. However, the available information
suggests otherwise. The Borrower's draft completion report mentions very
small farmers as having derived negligible benefits from extension. The
Auffrett report of April 1986 notes that "results appear very satisfactory
for advanced farmers but are much more difficult to judge on other farmers
as no evaluation takes place." For small farmers (other than the
advanced), "results are very irregular."
3.31     Results of the extension component were also hindered by other
factors, including: (a) poor on-farm development and continued salinity
which inhibited the introduction or successful implementation of some
technologies; (b) initially negative farmer attitudes towards innovation
and lack of confidence in extensionists, many of whom were young and
inexperienced (though well-trained); tc) in the Project's later years.
staff shortages and an inadequate supply of vehicles; (d) delays in the
ongoing extension program caused by the floods of 1983 and the periodic
diversion of extension technicians to fight pest outbreaks, (e.g. the new
cotton infestation, Gusano Rosado de la India, appearing after 1983
floods); and (e) poor training of extensionists in water management, a
critical omission reported by Auffrett in 1986.
Development of Cooperatives
3.32     The SAR foresaw the extension component providing guidance to the
technical and managerial staff of cooperatives, but not direct extension,
since by law, cooperatives were meant to hire their own. In practice,
however, cooperatives took advantage of many extension activities though
the comparative level of assistance was weak and the trend was moving in
favor of more intensive involvement of DEPECHP in audiovisual training,
demonstration plots, and especially water management guidance within
cooperatives.
6/ If 1,898 families in the "peasant groups, category are added to
"minifundistas" as per SAR, the number is closer to 28,000 families or
a ratio of 1:1,150, and this does not include 418 small farmer families
(5-15 ha) or informal assistance to cooperatives.



- 11 -
3.33     There is little evidence that cooperatives' organization was
improved though they did receive considerably more extension service than
was originally contemplated. Though their yields were reported to be
better than small farmers, this probably resulted from pre-existing levels
of organization and accessability. Auffrett's 1986 data shows small
farmers with uniformly lower production costs, and higher net benefits per
hectare for the four major crops, than cooperatives (see Annex II,
Table 4). This is not surprising given the cooperatives, history of poor
credit approval and on-farm development which tends to caste doubt on
substantial organizational improvement resulting from the project.
Land Reclamation
3.34     Although adequate staff was hired, this component progressed
slowly for reasons already discussed above, including credit shortages, a
deteriorating drainage maintenance situation after 1983 and lack of farmer
interest. Activity was limited mostly to land levelling, bordering,
subsoiling and limited subsurface field drainage construction. By December
1987 such work had been initiated or completed on 9,800 ha, 53? of the
18,000 ha target, with 75Z on minifundia, and the remainder on
cooperatives. Soil salinity remained a serious problem late in the project
and salinity classification data remained approximate only, despite efforts
of the extension service.
Trainina Abroad
3.35     Some 19 DEPECEP technical personnel attended short courses abroad,
but shortage of funds by 1984 precluded further use of this component.
Consultant Services
3.36     Borrower inexperience in the technical requirements of a large
irrigation project necessitated the extensive use of consultants from the
earliest stages. Peruvian law required that consultant services for design
and supervision be through open contest but the Bank imposed its own
requirement for prequalification based on examination of contesting
proposals.
3.37     Consultants were used for:  (i) design and supervision of civil
works construction and on-farm development; (ii) formulation and
implementation of O&M of the principal irrigation and drainage network;
(iii) water usage plans for the Chira-Piura region; (iv) assistance in
establishing extension services and developing crop production packages;
(v) feasibility studies for possible Chira-Piura follow-on projects; and
(vi) post flood reconstruction and re-design.
3.38     The quality of consultants'performance varied and at times delayed
project implementation, especially up to mid-1983. The ISL Consortium
underwent several major managerial changes at DEPECHPs request and was
found in 1982 to have behaved improperly in its claims for services
rendered, overdrawing its total contracted amount a year early. Lax



- 12 -
supervision by DEPECHP, which had itself already suffered several top
management changes, was partly responsible and steps were taken by the Bank
to force the tighter ordering of ISL work priorities, while DEPECHP came
under closer scrutiny and control from the newly-established INADE. ENERGO
undertook the Chira Valley study but results were inadequate, especially
the economic and financial analysis. Because of its importance to the
project pipeline and the likelihood that it would promote further O&M and
water usage improvements, the FAO/CP was called in to review and revise the
study.
3.39     The work of several other consultants made positive contributions
to project implementation -nd sustainability. For example, the special
agro-economic study by Auffrett in 1986 focussed attention on a number of
persistent problems inhibiting the project's agricultural production and
institutional goals, including salinity and drainage, credit and extension
practice-. Measures already implemented by the end of 1986 included a
highly successful pilot drainage rehabilitation scheme and a BAP review of
cooperatives which found 80Z to be creditworthy, potentially paving the way
for better credit operation. A major study of O&I4 7 in the project area
was the basis for the crucial 1987 agreement on institutional arrangements
for O&M, between MAG, DGASI and DEPECHP.
C. Changes During Implementation
3.40     Many changes in project targets became necessary in response to
new information, political and economic forces and the 1983 floods. As
described earlier (para. 3.6), DEPECHP came under early pressure to
relocate the site of the main diversion dam, which brought an additional
3000 ha under irrigation. Targets for secondary and tertiary canals and
lateral/sublateral canals were drastically reduced in response to land
distribution and right of way complications, farmers, ongoing water needs
and other economic considerations. Flood control dikes and protection
groins not originally included were added after the 1983 disaster.
Targets for on-farm drainage works were amended several t.Zies to reflect
implementation realities.
3.41     A major change was the re-assignment of some US$24 million of loan
funds to the reconstruction effort after the floods. This and other
actions by the Bank, including creation of the loan Special Account to ease
GOP liquidity problems, and increasing Bank disbursements for civil works
from 65? to 90X under the Special Action Program, saved the project.

D. Disbursements
3.42     The SAR required that DEPECHP maintain separate accounts recording
expenditures made under different project categories and that BAP would do
likewise for its sub-loans for on-farm investment. Disburs?ments would
follow submission of appropriate supporting documentation to the Bank.
3.43     Disbursements were initially slow, reaching only 42% of Schedule
by the end of 1982. Peruvian liquidity problems and the need to pay
contractors and laborers regularly resulted in the opening of the Special
Account and Revolving Fund in early 1984. The project was also deemed
eligible, after the floods, for the Bank Special Action Program and
disbursements for the civil works component were increased from 65Z to 90%
from December 1983 until June 1985 (and subsequently extended until
December 1985).
3.44     The overall rate of disbursement picked up after 1984 and was
above the LAC profile for this type of project until project suspension in
May 1987, for GOP non-payment of arrears. The loan Special Account remains
open pending GOP documentation justifying an outstanding unrecovered
balance of some US$91,000.
E. Procurement
3.45     Financing and construction of major civil works was carried out by
ENERGO under special arrangements with the Borrower. Contracts for
secondary and tertiary canals, principal drainage works and procurement of
maintenance equipment and vehicles was under ICB with prequalification a
condition imposed upon the Peruvians.
3.46     Contracts for lateral/sublateral canals, buildings and
procurements of drainage pipes were under LCB, with foreign firms not
precluded. Field drainage construction, dependent upon other project
progress, was undertaken chiefly by force account. Contracts for on-farm
works with development credit were negotiated locally. ICB requirements
for civil works were waived for the 1983/84 flood reconstruction period in
favor of negotiated contracts with pre-qualified firms.
3.47     Despite ICB, prequalification and further screening at the bidding
and award stages, the behavior and performance of local contractors was
unsatisfactory in many instances and was described by Bank ttaff as a
continuous constraint on project execution. Lengthy administrative
procedures for LCB procurement were also unhelpful.

F. Compliance vith Loan Covenants
3.48     Compliance with loan covenants was satisfactory with the exception
of the Borrower's failure to institute the biennial review of water charges
after December 31, 1982, collect sufficient water charges to cover
farm-level O&M and invetitment costs, or transfer their equivalent to the
Irrigation District Authority. This situation resultel from a combination
of political and financial constraints, traditional farmer resistance to
paying realistic water charges and inadequate promotion of the potential
benefits of organized usage and maintenance.
G. Reporting
3.49     Reporting by DEPECHP was satisfactory, detailed and generally on
time, including submission of the Borrower's completion report.
Information and data provided was taken into account in preparing this
report, though the lack of comprehensive data on agricultural advances by
farm size or data linking on-farm development to production improvements
limits data-based assessment of Project effectiveness.
H.  Auditint and Accounting
3.50     Project accounts were adequately maintained and reflected
performance. Audit reports, while satisfactory and unqualified, tended to
be late and in the early stage of the project had some verification
problems, principally due to the Project Unit's lack of familiarity with
Bank procedures. After FY1984, audits were performed by specially trained
private firms with satisfactory results, though continued lateness in
submission caused the Bank to warn DEPECHP in 1986 of pote.tial suspension
if audit dates were not respected.
IV. PROJECT IMPACT
A. Physical Development
4.1      Most physical targets were met or achieved satisfactory progress,
with the critical exception of on-farm development which in most cases
failed to reach even greatly reduced goals. Table 4.1 summarizes these
achievements.

B. Agricultural Impact
4.2      The agricultural development program envisaged in the SAR was
based on improved irrigation water distribution and management, and the
provision of agricultural extension and marketing services. These would
lead to more intensive cultivation and production, particularly by the
poorest farmers. The SAR also envisaged improved cooperative organization
and access to credit and other services for some 9,000 minifundistas and
members of peasant groups.
4.3      As described earlier, some of the major elements of this program
were implemented much more slowly than had been envisaged at appraisal and
as a result, by project completion, the productive goals of the project had
not been fully met. The main achievements were yield increases for rice,
corn, sorghum and pulses (Table 4.2). The main shortfall was in the rate
of development of the cultivated area, which rose from 27,469 ha. in 1979
to 30,213 ha. in 1986 (compared with an appraisal target of 34,720 ha).
4.4      The principal factors which inhibited the growth in output were
the slow uptake of credit for on-farm development, the poor ratio of
extension agents to small farmers and disappointing development of
marketing services. Lack of on-farm development meant continued salinity
and water-logging, described by Auffrett in 1986 as the principal
constraint on agricultural progress. In areas where on-farm drainage
improvements were implemented, limited available M&E data clearly shows
their beneficial agricultural impact (Table 4.3). The eventual achievement
of the production targets for the project area is certainly feasible, in
the early 1990s, given the momentum already created. However, this will
depend upon a continued Government commitment to the 0&M, extension and
credit components leading to the completion by the farmers of the on-farm
works. Information received since completion suggests that such commitment
is continuing.
4.5 -    The SAR anticipated no real change in types of crops grown, and
for the four ma4or crops this was confirmed in practice. Cotton
monoculture continued on about 90% of the project area. However,
cultivation of garden crops (onions, green corn and sweet potato) and
fodder (alfalfa) dropped off sharply from pre-project levels in both
seasons and rarely even approximated appraisal goals. Such crops require
well-organized marketing and local markets were too small and quickly
saturated to provide incentive. This was unfortunate because, being labor-
intensive, garden crops provide employment potential. Cropping patterns
for corn and sorghum were also different frc-a the projections, becoming
second season crops exclusively from 1981 onwards. Local demand for both
crops tended to be weak, prices low, aad storage capacity inadequate. A
nationwide deficit of these crops however, and GOP price liberalization
might stimulate greater future production. The area devoted to rice
cultivation exceeded targets in six out of eight years with four times the
taeiget cultivated in 1987 (Annex II, Table 5).

4.6      Monitoring and evaluation of the project's agricultural impact by
DEPECHP was set up in 1982 under Bank guidelines. However, there is
inadequate data on crops, areas cultivated, production and yields by
production unit or their linkage to levels of on-farm development, thus
limiting judgements about comparative gains within the target population.
Auffrett reported in 1986 that lack of personnel in the M&E division caused
its focus to be limited to advanced farmers with no sampling of the others.
Auffrett recommended the hiring of additional technicians to re-orient M&E
towards evaluation of the impact of extension work, on-farm development.
water use and salinity control by sampling advanced and other farmers, and
evaluation of technical knowledge and experience gained thus far by the
extension service. It is not known if this occurred.
C. Economic ImDact
4.7      The SAR analysis was based on three farm models (1.8 ha, 15 ha,
and 1,000 ha) and yielded an ERR of 15Z. As noted above, at project
completion, the agricultural production targets from which the economic
rate of return was derived, had not fully materialized, though sufficient
momentum had been created for them eventually to be met. Unfortunately, it
is likely that this momentum has been lost in the years since loan closing
for reasons beyond the control of the project itself. The principal
factors leading to the delays during the project implementation period
were: (a) project effectiveness was delayed by seven months from Board
presentation and some 18 months from appraisal; (b) major civil works were
completed almost 2 years behind schedule because of the 1983 floods; and
.c) the number of potential beneficiaries in the project area was much
greater than estimat    with implications for credit, technology adoption,
and on-farm development, which were generally delayed by 2-3 years.
4.8      Because of the security situation, minimal Bank supervision was
possible in the year before completion, and no PCR mission was undertaken.
As a result, the data available is insufficient for a meaningful ex-post
economic evaluation, though it is certain that the final outcome would be
well below the 15Z calculated at appraisal. The uncertainties affecting
such an evaluation are: (a) the impact of the general economic
deterioration on the eventual completion of on-farm works, extension
services and O&M; (b) lack of important M&E data covering prices and
output, complicated by inflation, dual exchange rates and other
administratively induced market distortions; and (c) the general
deterioratio of the economy, infrastructure and internal security.
4.9      In spite of this negative assessment, there were important, and
perhaps lasting, benefits arising from the project. These included: (a)
better water management over a large part of the project area; (b) the
training of extension personnel for a broad range of responsibilities aimed
at disseminating k.nowledge, promoting innovation and enhancing income;
(c) reclamation of saline and waterlogged lands; (d) building DEPECHP into
an effective institution capable of successfully preparing and managing
follow-on projects; and (e) improved agricultural research and linkage to
production.



- 20 -
D. Environmental Impact
4.10     The project improved the environment through the reclamation of
saline and water-logged lands, the construction of flood control and
protection works, and through improved maintenance practices for weed and
silt control.
E. Potential Follow-on Proiects
4.11     The loan provided for feasibility studies of the Chira-Piura
complex for possible follow-on projects. Two studies were carried out:
(a) Chira Vallea. ENERGO financed and prepared a pre-feasibility
study of the Chira Valley from 1980-83. The result was considered
weak in its economic, financial and agricultural analysis and the
FAO/CP was brought in to review and complete the final feasibility
work, which was finished in early 1987. A project was, at that
time, under consideration for external financing.
(b)  Alto Piura.  This study was initiated in 1980-81 with Bank
endorsement. Political interference halted the process of rating
the 27 foreign and local proposals. In 1986, following a change
of Government and under renewed political pressure, DEPECHP
invited 6 prequalified firms out of the original 27, to submit new
proposals. DEPECHP contracted the TAHAL/ASCOSESA consortium which
started work in November 1986 on detailed analysis and review of
soils, hydrology, hydroecology, agriculture and engineering. Pre-
feasibility studies ended in March 1987, and completion of the
feasibility stage was scheduled for February 1988.
4.12     Suspension of all Bank lending to Peru in May 1987 prevented
further progress on develaping projects from tnese studies. The Bank
continued disbursements for the contracted consultancy services of
TAHAL/ASCOSESA on the Alto Piura study through December 31, 1987.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
A. The Proiect Unit
5.1      At GOP ir.sistence, DEPECHP became the principal executing agency
inspite of the reservations of Bank appraisal staff, who believed DEPERTC
(formerly PLANREHATIC) should have that role because of its probable
longer-term national involvement in irrigation rehabilitation. By
agreement, DEPERTC subsequently provided technical support and assistance
to DEPECHP for on-farm works and drainage. DEPECHP's chief strength was
construction, having built the Poechos Dam, the Chira-Piura diversion canal
and the Lower Piura main drainage network. At project outset, DEPECHP was
a semi-autonomous "special project" entity of the Ministry of Agriculture
but, under GOP decentralization policy, was transferred in 1980 to a



- 21 -
regional development body, ORDENORTE, to whom it reported whilst
maintaining technical links with MAG and retaining its administrative
importance and autonomy. It underwent further organizational change in
late 1981, being grouped with five other major water projects under the
Special Council for Hydraulic Projects, responsible to the Prime Minister.
The Loan Agreement vested DEPECHP with extensive coordinating powers over a
broad range of project activities. DEPECHP successfully maintained a high
level of autonomy and authority throughout the project period.
5.2.     The staffing and organizational structure of the Project Unit (PU)
were established early on in accordance with appraisal goals. Following a
very difficult start (four project managers were installed in the first
three years), the operational departments were periodically reviewed and
strengthened during implementation and its diverse activities supplemented
with consultant services, as provided for in the Loan. It was assisted
from 1981 onwards by the ISL Consortium, retained to provide expert design,
construction and supervisory services for which pressing need emerged once
the project got underway. The relationship between DEPECHP and the
consortium was redefined and tightened in 1983 after irregularities emerged
including lax control of claims and disbarsements to consultants and
contractors, over-use of loan funds for overseas training and a tendency to
avoid consulting the Bank on important technical and procurement decisions.
Performance improved markedly after stricter guidelines for ordering work
priorities and expenditures were laid down. In 1983 DEPECHP was also
brought under the oversight of INADE, the newly-created national
development body, but continued to develop and operate as an autonomous
independent entity.
5.3      Further political interference in 1986 left the project without
leadership for 3 months, delaying implementation. The appointment of an
experienced and motivated new director later in the year, injected fresh
momentum into project execution, especially as measured by farmer interest
in the 1986/87 special pilot drainage rehabilitation scheme and its
success. However, political pressures from the Government resulted in his
replacement in 1988.
5.4      Despite these difficulties, DEPECHP developed and consolidated its
experience and expertise over a broad range of responsibilities essential
to the project, becoming in the process an efficient institution, well-
equipped to handle future projects of this type. The long-awaited
agreement between DEPECHP, DGASI and MAG laid the foundations for the
institutional continuity of 0 & M and extension, and DEPECHP's important
interim role in both.
B. Proiect Coordination
5.5      The project presented a formidable coordination task given its
complex technical requirements, the need to launch major components
virtually simultaneously, and the PU's responsibility for facilitating
project start-up while still establishing its own staff, role and
priorities. The Loan Agreement vested DEPECHP with extensive coordinating
powers and it was fortunate in already having experience in major civil
works construction. Its special project status and real autonomy enhanced



- 22 -
its ability to secure the cooperation of other agencies. Bank supervision
missions worked closely with DEPECHP to keep project priorities and
implementation on track with commendable results, especially during the
flood reconstruction period. Although the justification for re-assigning
parts of the Loan to reconstruction included the argument that some less
urgent works would, of necessity, have to be re-targeted in later projects,
this resulted from an exceptional situation. There was a consistent effort
throughout to keep all components progressing and not to sacrifice some to
make others work. The project was, in fact, characterized by a high
degree of component interdependence necessitating a balanced focus to
achieve its goals.
C. Consultants
5.6      Consultants were used extensively throughout the project to inform
and supplement the activities of the PU and were a key element from the
earliest preparation phase. In the later stages two consultant executed
studies were especially influential in: (i) laying the foundations for
institutional 0 & M and (ii) focussing institutional attention on
shortcomings in extension, 0 & M, land reclamation, credit and cropping
practices.
D. Agricultural Credit
5.7      The BAP was responsible for providing medium and long-term credit
for on-farm development to small farmers and cooperatives. Its lending
performance was disappointing, especially for cooperatives, due partly to
budget shortages and partly to an overly conservative stance on loan
evaluation which imposed serious constraints on project implementation.
The efforts of DEPECHP to formulate and process loan applications for
submission to BAP, including the grouping of small farmers for loan
purposes, and the Bank's suggestions for different loan evaluation
criteria, effected little change. A Bank-prompted BAP review of
cooperatives' financial status in 1986, found 0S to be creditworthy, but
this came too late to enhance seriously, the project's on-farm credit
component, though encouraging results in drainage rehabilitation, funded by
special BAP loans, were achieved in early 1987 before project suspension
(see Table 5.1).

E. Agricultural Extension
5.8      The project funded the salaries and operating expenses of 54
incremental agricultural extension staff in the extension division of
DDAIDEPECHP.8 A five year Agricultural Extension Plan went into operation
in 1981, as an essential part of DEPECHP's overall Agricultural Development
Plan. The Piura Valley was divided into five agencies corresponding to
important population centres with marketing facilities. Each agency team
of seven consisted of agricultural engineers, livestock technicians,
agronomists with expertise in local crops, entomology, agro-economics and
cooperative administration, and support staff. Technolog:Lcal packages were
developed through collaborative arrangements with INIPA, CENCIRA, CESPAC,
the Chira Research Station (I & D) and experimental areas at Montegrande
and Pedregal.
5.9      Progress was slow in the first three years but extension
performance achieved diverse and commendable results including strong links
to production-oriented research. Salient features included:
(a)  The setting up of 720 farmer demonstrators (agricultores de
enlace) from whose direct experience some 7,200 additional
farmers benefitted indirectly in the first 3 years.
(b)  The introduction of audiovisual training in 1983 by agreement
with CESPAC, which served around 6,000 farmers per year.
(c)  From 1986, the installation of about 60 demonstration plots per
year, focussing on joint cropping and hybridization of corn,
variety and adaptability comparisons of other major crops, rice
cultivation techniques and horticultural activities. New corn
hybrids were introduced on cooperative land with excellent yield
results, exceeding the 6,200 kg/ha average of the project area.
(d)  The provision of technical assistance and organizational
guidance to 16 cooperatives, benefitting some 840 members on
average, each year. Included were audiovisual courses on
cotton, rice storage, dairy herd management and pest evaluation.
(e)  The introduction in 1986 of 4 pilot areas for cattle, goats,
poultry and pigs which evolved into livestock technology
demonstration centers.
(f)  The promotion of a significant second season crop through the
use of techniques developed at the Pedregal and Montegrande
stations. In 1987, a record 6,850 ha second crop was installed.
(g)  The introduction of field days (dias de campo), agricultural
methodology demonstrations and pilot farms (granjas pilotos).
8/ It is not known if 54 were actually hired. A June, 1982 SPN mission
report charts 52 positions within DDA/DEPECHP and Auffrett listed a
total of 48 by 1986. Staff shortages by then were described as
hindering extensi.   but it is not known if attrition was the main
problem or simply th; 4ncreased service provided, required more staff.



- 25 -
(h) The launching by DEPECHP in 1987, of a cattle development
scheme, working jointly with FONGAN on genetic improvements
through artificial insemination.
(i) The setting up of a specialized irrigation technology pilot
scheme on 2 demonstration areas of 25 ha each, to test
technologically-advanced irrigation methods on production of
high value cash crops (fruits and vegetables) for agro-
industrial processing, local consumption and export. Initial
results were promising.
(j) The implementation of an irrigation pilot plan (para 5.12) to
better apportion water at the tertiary and farm level, not
served by the gravity system.
P. Water Management and Usage
5.10    The General Water Law of 1981 sought the participation of users in
planning water resource management and the 0 & M activities of Irrigation
Districts, through their grouping into water User Associations (Juntas de
Usuarios) and committees of persons with water rights (Comisiones de
Regantes). Up to 1987, the Irrigation Districts operated on a restricted
budget and, with help from DEPECHP extension personnel and vehicles,
limited their operations to: (a) weekly definition of water needs and
adjustment of main canal discharges; (b) management and maintenance of some
canals; and (c) decisions on water charges and supervision of their
collection by BAP (at the time of crop sale).
5.11    Improvements in water management have been slow, with continued
excessive application and wastage of up to 50Z of consumption due to: (a) a
tradition of excessive use whereby farmers believe constant, unmeasured
application produces better yields; (b) the "machacow practice of a first,
high volume, pre-irrigation justified on leaching grounds (but which, in
fact, exacerbates salinity by raising the water table); (c) deficiencies in
the Irrigation District's control of water d'stribution and delivery, made
more difficult by ongoing lack of accurate soil classification or salinity
data, unfavorable topography and land tenure patterns for water delivery,
and poor system maintenance; and (d) lack of an institutional or legal
commitment to realistic water charges, or penalties for abuse.
5.12    Under the auspices of the Irrigation Pilot Plan an agreement
between DEPECHP and the Lower Piura Irrigation District went into effect in
1987, enabling joint action on: (a) planning and implementation of water
usage patterns; (b) preparation of farm and irrigation plans; and (c)
annual maintenance and river defense plans and their coordination with the
user bodies. DEPECHP's specific role in water distribution is through
control of principal infrastructure (e.g., Poechos and Los Ejidos dams, the
diversion canal, and principal drainage canal). The Ministry of
Agriculture, through the Irrigation District, controls secondary canals and
approves farm plans and on-farm water distribution. Actual control of
water occurs at the major headwater stage and at bifurcation points, while
water quantity is measured at locks off secondary canals. No on-farm
measurement yet exists.



5.13    Organizational results are reported to be satisfactory so far with
good coordination between DEPECHP, the Lower Piura Irrigation District and
User Associations.
G. Water CharRes
5.14    Resources from water user charges of agricultural origin are
supposed to automatically become the revenue of water User Associations
within Irrigation Districts, under the General Water Law of 1981. Such
revenues are intended to cover the real costs of water management and
distribution, 0 & M, and investment cost recovery. In practice, only
nominal charges have been imposed and even those were difficult to adjust
or collect, chiefly because User Associations failed to see their value in
the field and because of the arbitrary requirement that the maximum tariff
chargeable not exceed 5Z of the cost of production of the least profitable
crop. A Loan covenant required Borrower review of water charges by
December 31, 1982 and every two years thereafter; however, at Project s
end, no such review had occurred. While water charges were significantly
increased for 1987 to Soles 25/M3 from Soles 10.2/M3 in 1986 and Soles
2.0/M3 in 1985, they still represented only partial coverage of real costs.
DEPECHP prepared a budget for 1988 for 0 & M of tertiary irrigation systems
and maintenance of secondary drains, dependent upon payment of Soles
130/M3, and subsequently launched an aggressive campaign to convince User
Associations to further increase charges to Soles 160/M3, but because of
continued flaws in the water law, DEPECHP cannot enforce compliance.
H. Operation and Maintenance
5.15    From October 1985, DEPECHP became formally responsible for 0 & M of
all major infrastructure, in addition to collector drainage maintenance and
periodic inspections of the derivation dam and flood dikes. The Agrarian
Zone II (MAG) handled maintenance of on-farm secondary and tertiary canals
and drainage, sharing this responsibility with User Associations. These
functions suffered from budget restrictions and shortage of personnel.
5.16    Successive Bank missions pressed DEPECHP to institute 0 & M to
prevent deterioration of the system, loss of project benefits and potential
socio-economic problems. By 1986 there was still virtually no maintenance
of the drainage system which had deteriorated seriously after the 1983
floods due to progressive silting and weed growth.
5.17    Loan covenants relating to 0 & M were difficult to implement.  At
project conclusion, the GOP had failed to ensure the collection of charges
equal to expenses and their transfer to the Irrigation District, reflecting
political and economic realities beyond easy solution. Similarly, it was
not until the final days and under considerable pressure from the Bank that
an agreement was signed between DEPECHP, DGASI and MAG, establishing and
funding institutional arrangements for 0 & M (and extension) along the
lines of the covenant requiring such GOP support. The findings of a



- 27 -
special study contracted by DEPECHP in 1986 (at Bank's insistence), to plan
a program for 0 & M, agricultural development and institution
strengthening, 9 directing efforts away from construction to the production
phase, were influential in formulating this Agreement.
5.18    Shortage of funds prevented rapid implementation of the program but
did result in the setting up of an important pilot scheme aimed at
developing proper institutional handling of 0 & M, including sound
maintenance practices for the entire system, promotion of water
conser-,ation, and improved cultivation techniques.
VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
6.1     The assumption at appraisal in 1978, that the project could be
completed in 5 years, was overly optimistic and early indications should
have shown that implementation would not be smooth in important respects.10
Counterpart funding became a problem as early as 1977 when scant GOP funds
for preparation work due to budget cuts by the new Government, caused the
Bank preparation team to have to resort to special Bank arrangements (e.g.,
Project Preparation Facility and retroactive financing) to help pay for
consultants' feasibility studies. This, plus inferior work by some
consultants requiring review and repetition, caused the appraisal timetable
to slip repeatedly. The situation was hard to control and important
preliminary surveys and testing had to be deferred to the final design
phase when the executing agency could exercise greater influence. This, in
turn, delayed project start-up and implementation in the first year.
6.2     File memoranda acknowledge pressures to accelerate Project
preparation and appraisal chiefly because of (a) the already high prior
investment in major infrastructure (Poechos Dam, Chira-Piura diversion
canal) standing idle; (b) the risk of its deterioration and loss of
potential benefits; and (c) the primary importance of the Chira-Piura
complex and its place in the project pipeline. The timetable slipped
further owing to uncertainty about GOP creditworthiness and a follow-up
appraisal mission was required before Board presentation to clarify
important remaining issues.
6.3     The SAR accordingly shows evidence of superficial Project
preparation including: (a) unrealistic beneficiary income data and
expectations; (b) general assumptions that the poorest farmers would both
receive and benefit from extension and credit without specifying how; (c)
overly ambitious forecasts of agricultural development reflecting lack of
involvement with beneficiaries that would have informed more accurately
about attitudes to credit, belief in project goals, resistance to change,
and actual land tenure situation; and (d) the assumed provision of
marketing services, and a trouble free marketing environment.

6.4     During implementation the Project benefitted from regular and
comprehensive Bank supervision which strove to maintain momentum, attend
evenly to all components and find solutions to problems as they :rose, with
varying degrees of success. The Bank's actions in response to the 1983
flood disaster saved the project, with minimal cost overruns and
ultimately, after exhaustive effort spanning several years and
interventions at the highest level, a satisfactory solution to the
insurance payment dispute. This ensured a superior level of funding (than
the interim amounts allocated by the GOP in 1987) and thus the
sustainability, of institutional 0 & M and extension for the first several
years after project completion.
6.5     Bank performance was less successful in securing compliance with
Loan Covenants concerning water charges and 0 & M which, despite consistent
effort, achieved only partial and late solution.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.1     The project successfully completed major civil works foreseen at
appraisal but it did not achieve its targets in crop yields and technology
adoption. It was only partly successful in establishing sound water
management and maintenance practices and failed to promote the collection
of realistic water charges. Credit performance and on-farm development
were disappointing.
7.2     Despite early evidence of the Borrower's technical inexperience and
budgetary problems, the project established an ambitious set of targets
which were not fully achieved by the completion date. Lack of managerial
continuity, political interference and counterpart funding problems
sporadically hampered the performance of an otherwise effective Project
Unit. Setbacks from the 1983 floods also hindered implementation, though
reconstruction and agricultural recovery in their aftermath were
impressive.
7.3     Lessons Learned.  The following lessons could usefully guide the
preparation of similar projects in future:
(a) Despite its many problems, the project had some positive impact on
the economy and lives of its beneficiaries. Almost certainly,
that impact would not have been made without the dedicated
professional involvement of the Project Unit supported by frequent
Bank supervision, throughout its implementation. Clearly, this
kind of operation can be an appropriate vehicle for transferring
technical knowledge and developing managerial skills, but for its
success it requires a priori a high level of cor,umitment from the
Borrower.



- 29 -
(b) The failure of the project to meet its appraisal targets indicates
a need to be more realistic in setting those targets in the first
place. The problems encountered by the project are not, in
hindsight, all that surprising. They are the normal problems of
management, incentives and traditional aversion to risk. Many of
these potential problems were ignored at appraisal, under the
pressure of preparation and appraisal deadlines. Some of the
subsequent delays in implementation may actually be attributable
to the lack of thoroughness in preparation.
(c) A major area of failure, in this and many other rural development
projects, was the lack of involvement of potential beneficiaries
at zhe planning stage. Failure to evaluiate the incentive system
among small farmers and failure to assess their creditworthiness
in the light of known BAP criteria led to over-optimistic
projections for the uptake of credit and for the development of
an-farm irrigation.
(d) These failures might have been mitigated at an earlier stage had
there been a more effective Monitoring and Evaluation System.
(e) The obvious need to ensure an adequate recovery of costs ran up
against practical and legal impediments which could and should
have been foreseen at appraisal. A more forceful approach to
setting and maintaining, covenants on cost recovery is needed in
future operations.
(f) The inclusion of funds for the preparation of follow-on operations
was justified. Had the project not been overrun by political and
economic turmoil at national level, it would by now have been
followed by a further stage in irrigation development.

Flood Emergency: Actions and Outcome
1.       Extensive and devastating flooding from the El Nino phenomenon
between December 1982 and June 1983, seriously damaged major project works
at or nearing completion, with costs of reconstruction variously estimated
at the time to be around US$30-40 million. Crop losses were generally
moderate because the onset of the rains coincided with and halted sowing,
but cotton losses were heavy. The disaster was a major blow to ENERGO
which was already experiencing internal financial difficulties unrelated to
the floods, and put further stress on the Borrower's budget.
2.       While ENERGO acted rapidly to begin the re-design and
reconstruction of the structures within its purview, its activities were
constrained by the refusal of the international insurance consortium to
maintain the pace of insurance reimbursements, which increasingly lagged
ENERGO outlays. To alleviate this situation and salvage the project, the
Bank took the following steps:
(a) Established the Loan Special Account (with an initial deposit
of US$4.0 million) and Revolving Fund, to ease GOP liquidity
problems. This facility had, in any case, been requested by
DEPECHP and was under consideration before the disaster struck,
to ensure the regular payment of contractors and labor under
deteriorating GOP budget conditions.
(b) Increased Bank disbursements for Category A civil works from
65Z to 90Z for two years, under the Special Action Program.
(c) Waived the I.C.B. rc.qzirement for Project civil works,
allowing negotiated contracts with prequalified contractors,
not to exceed US$8.0 million for the 1983/84 reconstruction
period.
(d) Amended the Loan Agreement accordingly, including extension of
the Closing Date one year, to December 31, 1986.
3.      The damages incurred necessitated the re-design and reconstruction
with expert assistance, of important elements of the major structures
including: (a) the widening and reconstruction of the Los Ejidos dam
spillway for which hydraulic models were built and tested; and (b) the
flood protection system, and the addition of erosion groins not previously
included. Major topographical changes caused by the floods required the
re-design of Bank-financed secondary and tertiary canals. Additional
equipment was pur_hased, or diverted from other uses to facilitate the
effort.

4.      Agricultural production for 1983 was low, with a first cycle of
only 4,000 ha, chiefly corn and sorghum for subsistence. Much of the
cotton crop was lost and rice yields were poor. Extension was initially
limited, due to poor access, but T & V was restored later in the year and
7,000 farmers visited.
5.      Enormous progress occurred in 1984 however, owing to an impressive
input of funds, manpower and equipment provided by MAG, and coordinated by
DEPECHP and INADE. The main diversion canal resumed operation, permitting
the start-up of irrigation. Agricultural production achieved record
yields, especially for rice. The Special Account and Revolving Fund were
fully operational, as was the SAP. By mid-year, the Project was
approaching its original schedule.
6.      However, ENERGO's financial position had worsened and all
construction of flood protection works ceased from May until September
1984. The principal cause was the insurance consortium's refusal to
continue reimbursements for a 90 day period during which it ordered the
examination of original designs of the insured works. ENERGO had so far
received only US$6.0 million of US$12.0 million expended. ENERGO was
further weakened by the GOP's non-payment since May 1983, of US$40 million
in counterpart funds under bilateral arrangements.
7.      Pending resolution of  the above, the Bank's assistance was again
sought to avoid potential socio-economic and political pressures stemming
from delays in completion of works and resumption of normal production in
the valley. The Loan Agreement was accordingly amended and some US$5.0
million was reallocated to reconstruction, principally affecting the credit
component which was reduced to its already committed level of US$1.8
million (from US$5.9 million) with future responsibility for credit being
transferred to Loan 2302-PE, Agricultural Credit IV. Future insurance
reimbursements to ENERGO were required to be deposited into the Project
Account. Total Loan funds re-assigned to reconstruction were US$24.4
million.
8.      Despite the Bank's best efforts, the insurance dispute remained
unresolved at project closing; however, recent negotiations concluded an
agreement for the reimbursement by the insurors of US$10.0 million of which
a first installment of US$5.0 million has been deposited in the Project
Account as agreed. These funds will be directed to sustaining the
institutional arrangements for 0 & M and extension, agreed upon in 1987.

Dear Sirs:
Re: PERU - Lower Piura Irrigation Rehabilitation Project II
(Loan 1771-PE)
We thank you for the Project Completion Report for Lower Piura Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project II, Peru (Loan 1771-PE) of March the 2nd, 89 which is
considered by us as a continuation of your attention and understanding,
shown to us on many occasions during the execution of works.
We agree with your evaluations given in the Report which we have studied
carefully.
We think that we could add some data from our evidence:
- The dykes in the Piura valley were built in total length of 65826 m,
29240 m of which were on the left bank and 36586 m on the right one.
- The total value of the works carried out by our Company according to the
Main Contract and to the Add. No. 1 was 124.128.552 US$, and the sum f
63.6 million US$ was financed by us.
- The works which we carried out on the reconstruction and protection  f
fills (Add. 2 and 5. of the Main Contract) amount to 8.939.112 US$.
- The works on the Poechos Dam benaviour investigation (Add. No.3) .moL ted
to 60.000 US$.
- The works on the Los Ejidos Dam free weir reconstruction (Add.No.4) amounted
to 3.698.322 US$.
- The works on the reconstruction of canals and dykes after the floods,lexecuted
after August 27th, 1984 amounted to 8.003.497 US$. A part of the recl struction
works were financed by the Insurer till August 27th, 1984.              Ii
Hoping that the above data will be useful for you, we remain
Sincerely yours.
