IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO
HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
(LOAN 2875-ME)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Highway Maintenance
Project in Mexico for which Loan 2875-ME in the amount of US$135 million was approved on
October 6, 1987 and made effective on February 2, 1988.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1995 compared with the original closing date of June 30,
1994. Final disbursement took place on February 28, 1995.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Enrique Pinilla, task manager for the project, and reviewed
by Mr. Martin Staab, division chief LA2IN.
Preparation of this ICR began at the time of the Banks completion mission during October,
1994. It is based on materials in the project file. The borrower contributed to the ICR by
preparing its own evaluation of the project's execution. (Appendix B).






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO
HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
(LOAN 2875-ME)
Evaluation Summary
Project Objectives
1.  The objectives of the project were to: (a) assist the government and the Secretariat for
Communications and Transport (SCT) in improving their maintenance capabilities and
operations on the federal network so that the backlog of deferred periodic maintenance can be
reduced or eliminated and maintenance requirements provided in the future on a timely basis; (b)
enhance the cost effectiveness and help maximize the economic benefits of road maintenance by
improving maintenance planning and management; and (c) promote the implementation of
appropriate cost recovery policies for roads such that taxes on heavy vehicles cover at least the
marginal cost attributable to them (para. 6).
2.  The project was intended to support the Government's five year Maintenance Improvement
Program (1987-1991), including: (a) periodic maintenance of paved roads and bridges; (b)
provision of new, improved or expanded workshop facilities,including required machinery, tools
and spare parts; (c) procurement of road maintenance equipment; (d) implementation of SCTs
equipment overhaul and rehabilitation program; (e) training in equipment operation, repair and
maintenance and in road maintenance planning and operations; and (f) consulting services for
training and for studies and technical support to upgrade maintenance planning, design and
execution (para. 11).
3.  Given the accumulated backlog of periodic maintenance of the paved road network, the
deteriorated condition of bridges and the equipment fleet, the need to increase public sector
revenues through cost recovery policies and the necessity to improve the planning and
managerial aspects of the maintenance budgeting process, the project objectives were clear,
realistic and important for the sector and consistent with overall Bank Lending Strategy (para.
12).
Implementation Experience and Results
4.  The project modestly achieved its physical objectives. Periodic maintenance and
rehabilitation of 6,100 km of federal highways was accomplished as compared to a SAR estimate
of 16,000 km. The repair and rehabilitation of 338 existing bridges was accomplished as
compared with a target of 400 bridges in the SAR. The institutional development objectives



HI
were substantially achieved with respect to: a) the implementation of the first stages of the
pavement management system (SISTER) and the bridge management system (SIPUMEX); (b)
the studies for the reorganization of the General Directorate for Maintenance of Public Works
(DGCCOP); and (c) the training of road maintenance personnel and equipment operators as well
as technical,administrative and managerial personnel of DGCCOP (paras. 15 and 16).
5.  The likelihood of project sustainability is high. The importance of contracting routine and
periodic maintenance has been established at the highest levels of Government; the
reorganization of DGCCOP is being implemented under loan 3628-ME as are the paving
management system (SISTER) and the bridge management system (SIPUMEX). Government
ownership of these institutional improvements has been demonstrated by the systematic use of
these managerial tools. The project outcome is rated as satisfactory (para. 25).
6.  The final project costs amounted to US$312.89 million or 11% greater than the estimated
amount of US$281.5 million. The financial disbursements were negligible during the first two
years after which most of the Bank's proceeds were disbursed during the next three years. The
loan was closed on June 30, 1995, one year later than the estimated date (para. 24).
7.  The project was estimated to begin implementation in early 1988 and be completed by June
30, 1994. Project implementation started with two years delay and was completed by the end of
1994. Project implementation during the early years was hindered by inadequate and untimely
budgetary allocations, the lack of experience and motivation by DGCCOP in the adequate
supervision and quality control of the works, the lack of experience of DGCCOP in managing
works under contract, the lack of incentives for SCT to contract the periodic maintenance of
roads and the lack of familiarity of DGCCOP with the Bank's procedures and regulations
regarding the contracting of works. After 1990 the DGCCOP began implementation as it was
originally intended. Budgetary allocations were linked to the execution of Bank-financed
projects; priority was given to highway maintenance; contracting of periodic maintenance
operations was established at high levels of government; and the DGCOP became more involved
in the design and supervision of work. From 1992-1994, with the advanced progress of works,
the DGCCOP placed great emphasis on the institutional development component of the project
during which time studies were completed for the paving management system (SISTER), the
bridge management system (SIPUMEX) and the reorganization of DGCCOP (paras. 18, 19 and
20).
8.  The Bank's performance in the identification stage was satisfactory. During the preparation
and appraisal stages, the Bank's assessment of SCT's implementation capacity and its
commitment to maintenance was probably too optimistic resulting in a design of the project
which was somewhat ambitious. During supervision, the Bank was able to compensate for some
of these problems by providing support and advice to the DGCCOP.  The Borrower's
performance during project preparation and appraisal was not as strong as it could have been
due in large part to the difficult macroeconomic situation confronting the country, the fact that
the government was at the end of its administration, and the confusion caused by the Mexico
City earthquake. In spite of the delay of two years, the borrower's performance during



iii
implementation was satisfactory following the resolution of its budgetary allocation problems
and its commitment to execute the project (paras. 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31).
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
9. The physical objectives were only partly achieved while the institutional developments
were substantially accomplished. The project suffered from an initial two year delay but once
budgetary problems were resolved and the government was convinced of the project's
importance, the DGCCOP began implementing the project at a rapid pace. The project has
assisted the DGCCOP to develop its institutional and human capacity in its effort to transform it
from an operational agency to an agency with a planning and strategic role (para. 32).
10. Under the ongoing Highway Rehabilitation and Traffic Safety Project (Loan 3628-ME),
the paving (SISTER) and bridge (SIPUMEX) management systems, and the reorganization of
DGCCOP continue to move forward. The importance of highway maintenance and the
contracting of maintenance of roads has been established at the highest levels of Government.
There is reason to be confident that the institutional improvements, started under the project, will
be sustained (paras. 25, 33).
11. The following lessons emerged from the project and have been taken into account in the
on-going loan 3628-ME (para. 34):
(a)         The implementing agency should be committed to undertake the
project and be familiar with Bank procedures regarding the contracting of works.
(b)         Resistance to institutional change may require a modest initial
approach to implementation of new policies and procedures. Opportunities for further
development may occur later, building on achievements. A flexible approach is needed.
(c)         Expenditures for Bank financed projects should be tied to budgetary
disbursements of the implementing agency.
(d)         The Secretariat for Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) should be
involved on a timely basis in discussions with the SCT and DGCCOP regarding the need for
additional allocations and better efficiency in the use of allocated funds, especially in tying
the allocations to the implementation schedule.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO
HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
(LOAN 2875-ME)
PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. INTRODUCTION
1.   Road transport in Mexico is the major mode for both passengers and freight. In 1989,
99% of intercity movement and about 84% of cargo movement by land between cities occurred
on highways.
2.   The Federal Highway Network, as well as the rest of Mexico's road system, has evolved
rapidly. From 1952, when there were only 27,000 kmn. of roads of which 16,000 km were
paved, the road system overall has grown to over 250,000 km of which about 95,000 km are
paved (including 9,000 km with four or more lanes). The slower annual rate of growth of paved
roads in the last twenty years is an indication that the network has reached relative maturity and
that, with the exception of some areas, the trunk network is in place.
3.   Highways have experienced a continual drop in the relative share of transport investment,
falling from over 60% of investment in 1977 to almost 400/o in the mid-1980's, to the point
where the annual budgets for construction and maintenance were insufficient to cover the needs
of the network. The level of traffic congestion and the condition of the road network led to
excessive vehicle operating costs and the progressive deterioration of the federal trunk network.
4.   During the Country Program Implementation Review held in July, 1985, the Government
proposed that the Bank support its efforts to reduce the backlog of deferred maintenance that
had rapidly accumulated. As a result, this project was prepared which would focus on overall
maintenance and the institutional improvements required as well as other deferred maintenance
needs.
5.   The Bank has been involved with the Mexican Highway Sector since 1960, and has made
a total of twelve loans, ten of which were for the federal road system. The two most recent
loans, the Highway Maintenance Project (Loan 2875-ME), and the ongoing Highway
Rehabilitation and Traffic Safety Project (Loan 3628-ME) have focussed on addressing the need
for maintenance and rehabilitation of the federal network.



2
Project Objectives
6.   The objectives of the project were to: (a) assist the government and the SCT in improving
their maintenance capabilities and operations on the federal network so that the backlog of
deferred periodic maintenance can be reduced or eliminated and maintenance requirements
provided in the future on a timely basis; (b) enhance the cost effectiveness and help maximize the
economic benefits of road maintenance by improving maintenance planning and management;
and (c) promote the implementation of appropriate cost recovery policies for roads such that
taxes on heavy vehicles cover at least the marginal cost attributable to them.
Evaluation of Objectives
7.   As a result of the economic crisis which began in 1982, the Government had to curtail
radically the sectoral investment plans, and by 1985, transport investment levels were 43% below
the 1981 levels. The budgetary cuts in the highway sector, coupled with the fact that many of the
pavements were substandard to support the heavy axle loads and higher traffic densities, led to
excessive operating costs and the progressive deterioration of the federal trunk system.
Consequently, many of the roads did not receive the necessary maintenance attention, causing an
accumulating backlog of periodic maintenance.
8.   A similar situation existed with regard to bridges. Many of the bridge structures in the
system were built before 1950 and the design loads were no longer compatible with the heavier
truck loadings utilizing these structures. In addition, the outdated design of expansion joints and
bearings led to the deteriorated condition of many of the bridges.
9.   An important part of the Government's annual maintenance budget exercise is the
planning and programming of highway maintenance operations. Due to the inadequacies in the
staffing and the organizational problems within the DGCCOP's Programming and Evaluation
Directorate, there was limited capabilities to prepare, optimize and justify annual and multi-year
maintenance budgets.
10.  In 1985, SCT in coordination with the Bank conducted a study on road user charges
which concluded that the total revenues from all road users were insufficient to cover total road
construction and maintenance needs. In particular, the heavier vehicles, which cause more
damage to the road system than other vehicles, were not paying their full share of the damages.
11.  Based on field investigations and economic analysis performed by SCT, the Bank
collaborated in developing a project to support the Government's five year maintenance
improvement Program (1987-1991). The project consisted of.
(a) Civil Works
Maintenance Program of roads in the Federal Highway Network which includes
the periodic maintenance of 7,000 km (of a total of 18,200 Iam) and the surface



3
treatment of 9,000 km (of a total of 48,000 km) of paved roads over the five year
period
Repair and Rehabilitation Program for existing bridges and culverts on the Federal
Highway Network which includes about 400 major bridges (of a total of 950
bridges) which require major repairs
Workshop Construction, Rehabilitation, Improvement and Expansion Program
including workshop tools and equipment and an initial stock of spare parts for
scheduled maintenance.
(b)  Maintenance Equipment
Repair and Rehabilitation Program for Existing Equipment
Procurement of New Road Maintenance Equipment including associated spare
parts
(c)  Training
Training Program including Technical Support for Training
(d)  Consulting Services
Consulting Services and Technical Support
12.  Given the accumulated backlog of periodic maintenance of the paved road network, the
deteriorated condition of bridges and the equipment fleet, the need to increase public sector
revenues through cost recovery policies and the necessity to improve the planning and
managerial aspects of the maintenance budgeting process, the project objectives were clear,
realistic and important for the sector and consistent with the overall Bank lending strategy.
13.  SCT, through DGCCOP, was responsible for the project's implementation. Periodic
maintenance and the rehabilitation of bridges were to be carried out by contract. Consulting
services were utilized to provide engineering, supervision and technical support to the DGCCOP
as well as to provide professional services to DGCCOP's Training Unit. Within the DGCCOP,
the Directorate for Programming and Evaluation was responsible for the planning, monitoring
and reporting of project activities. The Equipment Directorate within the DGCCOP handled the
procurement of new maintenance equipment, spare parts, tools and machinery as well as the
design, bidding and awarding of construction contracts, for new workshops.
14.  The total project cost, excluding taxes,was estimated at US$281.5 million, with a foreign
exchange cost of US$135.0 rnillion (representing 48% of the total project cost). The Bank loan
of US$135.0 million was to finance the total foreign exchange portion of the cost of selected



4
items. The Government was to provide the required counterpart funding through an annual
budgetary allocation.
B. ACHIIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Physical Objectives
15.  The physical objectives of the project were modestly achieved. They are summarized as
follows:
Civil Works:
Periodic maintenance for roads in the Federal Highway System. Project financing
provided for a portion of the government's five-year Maintenance Improvement Program
(1987-1991). Under the Project, rehabilitation and periodic maintenance"' of 6,100 km of
Federal highways was accomplished as compared with the SAR estimate of 7,000 km
periodic maintenance (overlay) and 9,000 km of surface treatment of paved roads. The
Government's Maintenance Improvement Program had even more optimistic targets of
about 66,000 km of asphalt overlays and surface treatments of which only some 10,000
km were accomplished. The physical targets were not achieved due to the following facts:
(a) insufficient budgetary allocations; (b) due to a two year delay in implementing the
projects many of the roads which were originally scheduled for periodic maintenance had
deteriorated rapidly to the point where they had to be rehabilitated instead, resulting in
cost increases of three to four times the original estimate and consequently reducing the
amount of work which could be done with the available funds; (c) the unit prices and
costs per km for civil works were underestimated mainly due to the fact that as result of
the effects of the Mexico City earthquake much of the critical cost data and road
condition inventory was lost or in disarray; (d) the basic experience of DGCCOP was
essentially confined to maintenance by force account with a lack of knowledge of unit
prices and costs of maintenance by contract; and (e) the SAR estimate included surface
treatment of roads as a separate work item when in reality these operations were
implemented as part of the periodic maintenance component;
Repair and rehabilitation program for existing bridges and culverts on the Federal highway
network: The repair and rehabilitation of 338 bridges were accomplished as compared
with the repair and rehabilitation of 400 bridges in the SAR estimate.
Workshop construction,rehabilitation. improvement and expansion program including
workshop tools and equipment and an initial stock of spare parts for scheduled
maintenance: The repair and rehabilitation of 28 maintenance depots was accomplished
(of a total of 31 depots).
1/ Surface treatment was included in periodic maintenance operations.



5
Maintenance equipment:
Equipment purchases for about US$10.8 million were financed under the project. With
the emphasis on implementing the civil works by contract, the need for greater amounts of
equipment was reduced and consequently the purchased equipment (vehicles,
telecommunication equipment, computers, tires, lubrication equipment and traffic control
devices) was for logistical and technical support of the DGCCOP.
Institutional Development Objectives
16.  The institutional development objectives of the project were substantially achieved as
follows: (a).about 8,200 persons from the SCT's Maintenance Directorate received training and
the upgrading of their technical capabilities in the areas of heavy equipment operation and
maintenance, on the job training of road maintenance crews, and the upgrading the performance
of field foremen; (b) the DGCCOP, assisted by its consultants, prepared studies for: (i) the
implementation of the first stage of the Pavement Management System (SISTER) which serves
as a base to evaluate different maintenance strategies for a multi-year period and to prepare
annual budgets, (ii) the implementation of the first stage of a Bridge Management System
(SIPUMEX), and (iii) to improve its human resources, budgeting, planning and programming, a
study was prepared which recommended the reorganization of the DGCCOP.
Economic Re-evaluation
17.  The recalculated ERR was done for a sample of 19 projects for periodic maintenance,
representing 15% of the total project costs.AII but one project continue to demonstrate ERR's in
excess of 12%. A lower than the estimated ERR in the case of project 19, Villahernosa-
Escarcega (Ramal a Palizada) is attributable to the fact that the feasibility study contained an
erroneous traffic count and an under estimation of the costs (Table 11).
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
18.  The project was scheduled to begin in early 1988 and be completed by June 30, 1994.
Project implementation was delayed by almost two years and was completed in October, 1994
upon the conclusion of the training component and Phase 1 of the Bridge Management System.
19.  During 1988 and 1989, practically no progress was made in the implementation of the
project. The project was designed to support the Government's 1987-1991 highway maintenance
program, on the assumption that the 1987 highway maintenance budget (about US$106 million)
would be increased by about 75% and that after that, it would grow 100/o annually in real terms.
The additional budget would then be implemented through the increased use of contracting
rather than the existing practice of force account. However, actual budgetary allocations for
1987, 1988 and 1989 failed to include the additional amounts required for project



6
implementation and most of the works were carried out by force account, which is not eligible
for Bank financing. Furthermore, as the condition of the network deteriorated, instead of
periodic maintenance, the network required heavy maintenance or rehabilitation. Also, the
release of budgeted funds was governed by fiscal planning considerations, keeping the flow of
available funds in the early part of the year artificially low and, in addition there was a lack of
incentives on the part of SCT to use the Bank Loan proceeds. In addition to the budgetary
difficulties, project implementation suffered initially from the lack of experience and motivation
of DGCCOP in the adequate supervision and quality control of contracted works as well as its
lack of familiarity regarding the Bank's procedures and regulations on the type of project under
execution. Lastly, the initiation of project implementation was ill timed as it coincided with the
last year of Government administration.
20.  Starting in 1990, DGCCOP began implementing the project as it was originally intended
primarily due to the fact that: (i) the new administration decided to link budgetary disbursements
to the execution of Bank-financed projects; (ii) the project was reformulated (the objectives
remained the same but the physical targets were modified) to support the 1989-1993
maintenance program; (iii) priority was given to highway maintenance over other activities; (iv)
the reformulated program took into account realistic budgetary projections negotiated with the
Secretariat of Programming Budget (SPP), the 1990 authorized budget for highway
rehabilitation and maintenance was increased to US$214 million and since then the budget
allocation has been increased to US$270 million for 1995; (v) contracting of highway
maintenance works was established at high levels; (vi) cash flows of finds have been improved
so that monthly allocations were more in line with the work implementation schedule; and (vii)
SCTs technical department became more involved in the design and supervision of work;
21.  Given the initial optimistic financial and physical estimates, in May 1991 the DGCCOP
found it necessary to request the Bank to reformulate the project to more realistic goals, without
changing its objectives (Table 15). The basis for reformulation was the execution of the 1989-
1993 maintenance program.
22.  During 1992, with most of the physical components under implementation or completed,
greater emphasis was placed on the institutional development component of the project and was
highlighted by the contracting of consultants to assist the DGCCOP in the initial phases of the
pavement management system (SISTER) and the bridge management system (SIPUMEX) and a
study of the reorganization of DGCCOP.
23.  The period 1993-1995 was characterized by the completion of the few remaining works,
mostly bridges, and the implementation of the training component of the project.
24.  The final cost of the project amounted to US$312.89 million, or 11% greater than the
original estimate. With regard to the periodic maintenance of road projects financed by the Bank
the total investments amounted to US$253.7 million of which the Bank financed US$111.4
million through 135 contracts. From 1988 to 1991 the disbursements under the loan were
practically nil. After the disbursement of US$10.0 million in the special account in February



7
1988, there were disbursements of only US$1,615 in January 1989, and US$2.0 million in
September 1990, after which time 80%o of the loan funds were disbursed during FY91, FY92
and FY93 (Table 4). The loan was closed on June 30, 1995, one year later than the original
closing date.
D. PROJECT SUSTAD`ABLIATY
25.  The project achieved most of its development objectives and the likelihood of
sustainability is high. It moved from a low level of ownership at its beginning to a high
ownership level when it was completed. The importance of highway maintenance, particularly
of adequate budgets, the contracting of maintenance of highways and the need for the efficient
use of resources is now recognized and established at the highest levels of Government. The
project has been successful in improving DGCCOP's ability to make better use of its human and
financial resources despite the frequent staff and managerial changes and insufficient budget
allocations. The DGCCOP has made substantial improvements in developing its institutional and
human capacity to move from a centralized operational agency into an agency with a planning
and strategic role. DGCCOP has trained a substantial number of its personnel in upgrading their
road maintenance, equipment operation, technical, administrative and managerial skills. With the
implementation of loan 3628-ME, it is expected that the project's objectives would be further
sustained. Under the ongoing loan the training of DGCCOP personnel is being continued; the
reorganization of DGCCOP will be completed; the pavement management system (SISTER)
and the bridge management system (SIPUMEX) will be implemented, and actions will be taken
to ensure that the Government has a sound highway cost recovery policy and establish a
systematic methodology to assess annually the status of highway cost recovery.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
26.  The Bank spent nearly 75 staff-weeks to identify, prepare and appraise the project
including 98 person-days in the field. A total of 100 staff-weeks was spent on supervision,
including 215 person-days in the field.
Identification
27.  Satisfactory. As a result of the Governments budgetary limitations to allocate sufficient
funds to maintain the backlog of deferred maintenance of roads that was rapidly accumulating,
the Bank satisfactorily addressed the constraints, focused on the sector policy issues and
collaborated with the DGCCOP in identifying a detailed five year maintenance Program.
Agreements were developed with the Government on objectives to be met. The Bank and the
DGCCOP satisfactorily identified the scope of the other components of the program including:
the technical support to assist in the planning and managing of road maintenance operations; the
requirements for the procurement of equipment and the rehabilitation and overhaul of existing
equipment; and a training program to upgrade the capabilities of technical, administrative and
managerial personnel of DGCCOP.



8
Preparation and Appraisal
28.  Deficient. The project appraisal stage had several shortcomings. Much of the cost
information and vital information relating to the condition of the road network had been lost or
in complete disarray due to the effects of the Mexico City earthquake. Not enough data was
available to properly appraise the cost and the amount of kilometers of roads to be included in
the program. The Bank was probably too optimistic in assessing the DGCCOP's implementation
capacity, the DGCCOP'S lack of experience in managing works by contract, and the
DGCCOP'S lack of knowledge of Bank procurement requirements. The project was appraised
on the optimistic assumption that substantial additional budgetary funds would allow
implementation through the increased use of contracting rather than by greater use of force
account. Given the history of maintenance allocations, the existing force account capabilities, the
assessment of SCT's implementation capacity and its weak maintenance planning, the Bank
appraisal was optimistic and the project turned out to be somewhat ambitious.
Supervision
29.  Satisfactory. The Bank collaborated with, and was supportive of the implementing agency
and other key entities involved with the project in the resolution of problems arising during the
implementation stage. The status and progress of implementation was satisfactorily reported in
Supervision Form 590 as well as in other reports and Aide Memoires, all of which satisfactorily
identified problems and recommended follow up actions to be taken by the implementing agency
or the Bank. During implementation the Bank sent 11 supervision missions at opportune times
to review the project, make a mid-term review of project implementation as well as to discuss
and resolve outstanding issues and implementation problems. The Bank provided correct and
timely advice and orientation to the DGCCOP contributing much to project implementation,in
such aspects as: discussions with SHCP and the SCT on the linking of budgetary disbursements
to the execution of Bank-financed projects; the increased use of periodic and routine
maintenance of roads by contract; and advising the DGCCOP in the preparation of Terms of
Reference for paving and bridge management studies as well as other studies included in the
institutional development aspect of the project.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
Preparation
30.  Deficient. As a result of the macro economic constraints confronting the country, the
confusion and disarray caused by the effects of the Mexico City earthquake and the fact that the
Government was at the end of its administration period, borrower participation in the
preparation process at this difficult time was less than adequate. There existed little or no
adequate records on road conditions nor adequate maintenance cost information on which to
make a satisfactory assessment of the project.



9
Implementation
31.  Satisfactory. During the first 2 years (1988 and 1989) of project implementation the
project was dornant. Although an amount of US$10 million was disbursed into the special
account, none of the resources were used. Implementation delays were due to the fact that: (a) a
new Government administration had just taken office; (b) the initial lack of interest of SCT to
carry out the project when the budgetary increases did not materialize; and (c) the allocated
funds were needed by the implementing agency to support their force account activities. Project
implementation dramatically improved in 1990. The new administration took positive steps
which included: the tying of the availability of budget resources to the use of Bank project funds,
the increase of the highway maintenance budgets; the strengthening of the administration of the
project within the SCT; and the acceptance at high levels to contract maintenance works of
roads instead of using in-house resources. As a result, contracts were let for the execution of
periodic maintenance and the rehabilitation of bridges and the disbursements of loan funds rose
at a sharp rate (during FY91, FY92 and FY93 an arnount of US$110 million or 81% of the
US$135 million loan funds were disbursed). SCT, however, was slow in preparing and
submitting the progress reports on project implementation to the Bank.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
32.  The project partially achieved its physical objectives regarding the periodic maintenance of
paved roads but substantially achieved its institutional development objectives. During
implementation priority was given to highway maintenance over other activities. The SCT
accepted the importance of contracting highway maintenance works, and established it as a part
of their highway maintenance program, and the SCT technical department has become involved
in the engineering and supervision of rehabilitation works. The changes sought by the project
are being institutionalized, particularly the pavement management system (SISTER) and the
bridge management system (SIPUMEX) which are being implemented and used in the
preparation and control of DGCCOP's annual budget. In addition, DGCCOP has been
reorganized and strengthened and it's planning and managerial role have been improved. Overall
the project is rated as satisfactory.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
33.  The DGCCOP has taken steps to ensure project sustainability. The ongoing Highway
Rehabilitation and Traffic Safety Project (Loan 3628-ME), provides for a continuation of the
training of technical, administrative and managerial personnel; the completion of the DGCCOP
reorganization; the systematic implementation of pavement and bridge management systems, the
rehabilitation and resurfacing of highways, and the rehabilitation and improvement of bridges. In
addition, a set of project monitoring Performance Indicators is in place, which will provide data
and infornation on the status and quality of DGCCOP's maintenance operations, providing
benchmarks against which improvement in road and bridge maintenance operations and
capability can be measured.



10
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
34.  The following lessons which emerge from the project provided the foundation for the
ongoing loan 3628-ME, Highway Rehabilitation and Traffic Safety Project and have been
incorporated in the ongoing loan:
- The Implementing Agency should be committed to undertake the project and be familiar
with Bank procedures especially related to procurement of works. The DGCCOP had,
for many years, undertaken the role as executor of projects, with little experience in
planning, contracting, monitoring and supervising the projects and no knowledge of Bank
procedures.
- The institutional appraisal both of the implementation agency and of the environment in
which it operates should be highlighted during project preparation and appraisal.
Resistance to change may require a modest initial approach in implementation of new
policies and procedures. Opportunities for further development may occur later, building
on achievements. A flexible approach is needed.
- Expenditures for extemally funded projects should be tied to budgetary disbursements
of the Implementing Agency. Without the incentive to utilize Bank Loan Funds, the
DGCCOP continued to only utilize its budgetary allocations which were primarily
destined for maintenance work by force account.
- The various branches of SHCP should be involved as early as possible in the project
cycle, in discussions regarding the need for additional allocations, better efficiency in the
use of allocated resources and especially in tying the allocations to the implementation
schedule. The involvement of the SHCP facilitated the discussions to improve the
budgetary allocations and to avoid the unbalanced allocations occurring at the end of the
year, causing many projects to be constructed in the rainy season with its consequential
rise in costs.
- Stress the importance of increasing the proportion of highway maintenance
expenditures relative to those for construction and of ensuring that timely financing for
periodic maintenance be provided during the highway life cycle in order to avoid the risk
of costlier reconstruction or rehabilitation.
- Encourage the Government to improve both the programming of works and the
preparation of multiannual projections. This would increase the efficiency and assist in the
rationalization of the highway sector.
- Encourage the contracting of periodic maintenance operations and a gradual increase in
the contracting of routine maintenance operations.

AYUDA MEMORIA
MISION DE CAMINOS DEL BANCO MllNDLAL
PROYECTO DE CONSERVACION DE CARRETERAS (Prestamo 2875)
1.    Esta Ayuda Memoria resume los principales temas tratados durante la misi6n
de caminos que visit6 Mexico entre el 7 y el 20 de octubre de 1994. La misi6n,
compuesta por el Ingeniero Enrique PiniJla, revis6 conjuntamente con las agencias
involucradas, el avance de la implementaci6n del Proyecto de Conservacion de
Carreteras funnciado con el Pr6starno 2875-ME.
La misi6n encontr6 que la fase de implementaci6n del proyecto estaba
concluida con la terminaci6n en septiembre del programa de capacitaci6n y en
octbubre de la primera fase del Sistema de Administraci6n de Puentes. Las ultimas
aplicaciones de desembolso estan en preparacion y se espera completar los
desembolsos antes del fin de ano. La misi6a tuvo la oportunidad de visitar algunas
de la obras financiadas con este pr6stamo en los estados de Yucatan y Campeche, y
acord6 en principio el calendario y actividades para preparar el Informe de
Terminaci6n del Proyecto. La misi6n conjuntamente con las agencias involucradas
en el proyecto hizo una evaluaci6n tentativa de la implementaci6n del proyecto.
Los objectivos del Proyecto y su Evaluacion
2.    El objetivo principal del proyecto era, segun lo consignado en el informe de
evaluaci6n del Banco de mayo 20, 1989, de asistir al Gobierno y a la SCT en
mejorar sus pricticas para la conservaci6n de las carreteras del sistema federal, para
abatir la acumulaci6n de trabajos de mantenimiento peri6dico y para que en el futuro
los recursos requeridos para la conservacion de carretares sean asignados a tiempo.
Ademas, el proyecto ayudaria a promover la implementaci6n de polfticas adecuadas
para la recuparaci6n de costos causados por los usuarios. La misi6n y los
funcionarios del Gobierno concluyeron que estos objectivos son lo suficientemente
claros, realistas e importantes para las estrategias del Gobierno en el Sector
transporte.
Logros de los obiectivos
3.    El pr6stamo cuyo monto es de US$135 milones fue hecho para financiar un
proyecto cuyo alcance representaba una parte importante del Programa de
Conservacion de Carreteras en el periodo 1987-1991 y su fecha original de cierre era
el 30 de junio de 1994. La implementacion del proyecto se caracteriz6 por tres
periodos cuyas caracteristicas son las siguientes:
o     El periodo 1987-1990 en que el proyecto tuvo muy poca actividad y el
desembolso del prestamo fue exiguo. Este periodo se caracteriz6 por reducciones en
el presupuesto para atender la politica macroecon6mica del gobierno (Anexo 1),
continuaci6n de las antiguas politicas tales como la ejecuci6n de los trabajos por
administraci6n, y el deteriodo rapido de la red.



- 31 -
o     El periodo 1990-1992 en el que se contrataron y realizaron la mayorfa de las
obras. Este periodo se caracteriz6 por el aumento en las asignaciones presupuesta.es
y el desembolso de la 2/3 partes del pr6stamo (Anexo 2).
o     El periodo 1992-1994, di6 enfasis al desarrollo institucional y se caracteriz6
por la contratacion y desarrollo de la fase inicial de los sistemas para administraci6n
de pavimentos (SISTER) y de puentes (SIPUMEX), asi como la elaboraci6n del
estudio para la reorganizaci6n de la D.G.C.C. Durante este periodo tambien se
prepar6 e implement6 un programa de capacitacion.
4.    En t6rminos ffsicos al Programa 1987-1991, fue disefado en base a que el
presupuesto de conservaci6n seria aumentado a partir de 1987 en un 75% y en
adelante seguiria creciendo cerca del 10% en terminos reales. La red a atender tenia
el 60% de su longitud en estado regular y 6% en estado malo.
Sin embargo, debido a la politica macroecon6mica de ajuste adoptada por el
Gobierno, los presupuestos de 1987, 1988 y 1989, alcanzaron solo un 60% de lo
estimado inicialmente y el pr6stamo s6lo empez6o a usarse hacia finales de 1989. En
consecuencia, la implementaci6n del proyecto sufri6 un retrazo de aproximadamente
dos anios y medio. Este atrazo tuvo un impacto significativo en la condici6n de la
red cuyo estado empeor6 significativamente y muchos de los sectores cuya condici6n
era regular en 1987 pasaron a una condici6n mala, y los trabajos de reparacion
costaron, 3 o 4 veces mis de lo previsto inicialmente; el resultado de todo esto fu6
una drastica reducci6n en los alcances fisicos del programa y del proyecto que de
por si ya eran armbiciosos. Gracias al inter6s de la administraci6n (89-94) se
adoptaron medidas, tales como la adopci6n de una estrategia para incrementar la
contratacion de la conservaci6n en 1990, el aumento de la asignaci6n presupuestal
(en mayo 1990) y la inclusion en le presupuesto de la partida de Credito Externo en
1989, que permitieron iniciar el proyecto y aumentar el interes de la DGCC por su
imnplementacion. En resumen puede decirse que el aspecto fisico del proyecto tuvo
un alcance modesto.
5.    Los logros de los objectivos relacionados con los aspectos institucionales, en
el parecer de los entrevistados, son satisfactorios. Los estudios financiados por el
proyecto, para la administraci6n de Puentes y Pavimentos y para la reorganizaci6n
administrativa de la DGCC, originaron cambios institutionales muy importantes que
se est.n implementando con el apoyo del Proyecto de Rehabilitaci6n y Seguridad del
Trafico (Prestamo 3628) y los programas de capacitaci6n financiados en ambos
prestamos redundaron en mejores practicas para la conservaci6n de carreteras. Con
respecto al sostenimiento o continuidad en los logros alcanzados, los directivos de la
SCT manifestaron su optimismo ya que una vez institucionalizado el cambio es mAs
dificil dar pie atris y lo que es mas importante estos cambios intitucionales tienen. el
respaldo de la Gerencia de la SCT.

6.    En relaci6n con el objectivo de promover la implementacion de polfticas
adecuadas para la recuperaci6n de los costos causados por los usuarios y los
compromisos manifestados en la carta de la SHCP del 25 de agosto de 1987 la
misi6n solicit6 el envio al Banco lo antes posible de un informe actualizado sobre el
estado de los ingresos por cargos a los usuarios (en paticular los vehiculos pesados) y
de los gastos en conservaci6n y rehabilitacifn de carreteras. (Este compromiso fue
confirmado en la carta del 25 de mayo de 1993 de los Subsecretarios de
Infraestructura de la SCT y de Hacienda y Credito Publico). Dicho informe seria
enviado al Banco antes del fin de abril de 1995.
Comportamiento de la agencias involucradas en el Prgyecto
7.    Este tema merece un poco mas de reflexi6n y las agencias involucradas,
SHCP, BANOBRAS y SCT prefirieron abordarlo en el informe final de evaluaci6n.
Sin embargo, hubo acuerdo en que la labor de equipo interagencial y con el Banco
deberia hacerse mas facil. Con respecto al comportamiento del Banco, la misi6n
recibi6 comentarios favorables de los funcionarios de la tres agencias mencionadas.
Segiin ellos, ia presencia del Banco da una mejor orientaci6n t6cnica y administrativa
de los programas de la DGCC, y ha servido para tener una mejor disciplina en los
procesos de selecci6n y evaluaci6n de los proyectos y en la mejor preparaci6n y
transparencia de la propuestas presupuestales. Tambien se he logrado una mejor
conciencia en las esferas decisorias del Gobierno sobre los montos presupuestales
para la conservaci6n de carreterea y las consecuencias de reducir su asignaci6n, lo
que has redundado en los aumentos presupuestales de los ultimos afnos. El Banco,
sin embargo, necesita adaptarse mas a la realidad de los pafses y ser mas flexible en
sus requerimientos estrechos de selecci6n de proyectos en base a criterios puramente
econ6micos y en los procesos de no objeciones durante los procesos de licitaci6n.
Por tanto, se deben buscar mecanismos que agilicen mis el proceso de no objeciones,
ya que de ordinario los tiempos son bastante apretados y la intervenci6n del Banco
necesariamente alarga el proceso.
Preparacion del informe final de evaluaci6n
8.    En general la conclusion fue que el proyecto puede calificarse como
satisfactorio ya que su objectivo principal de mejorar las praciticas de conservaci6n
en la red federal se esta cumpliendo. Para la elaboraci6n de la constribuci6n del
prestarario al informe final de evaluaci6n, el Banco prepar6 una guia que se adjunta
en el Anexo 3. Ademas, se acordaron tentativamente los sectores de carretera para
los cuales se actualizaria la evaluaci6n econ6mica e informacion de inventario a pie,
asi como los trabajos de carpetas, renivelaciones y sellos ejecutados desde 1990 en
dichos sectores (Anexo 4). El Anexo 5 muestra el estado de los componentes del
proyecto al fm del periodo de implementaci6n. El informe final de evaluaci6n
debera entregarse al Banco antes del 30 de abril de 1995.

RESUMEN
INFORME DE TERMINACION DEL CREDITO 2875- ME "CONSERVACION DE
CARRETERAS"
L-[-E  T-TR  DUCC CI N
El credito 2875 -ME se firrn6 el 4 de noviembre de 1987 y entr6 en efectividad a partir del 2 de
febrero de 1988. Este credito se concert6 para apoyar un prog-ama de inversiones de 5 afios
(1987-1991). La vigencia del prestamo se acord6 inicialmente hasta el 30 de junio de 1994 y su
monto fue de 135 millones de d6lares. Su objetivo principal fue apoyar al gobierno y a la SCI
en la mejora de sus practicas para la conservacion de las carreteras de la red federal, para
combatir el rezago del mantenimiento peri6dico y ayudar a proponer la implementaci6n de
polfticas para la recuperaci6n de costos.
Motivado por las estimaciones fisicas y financieras optimistas del Reporte de Evaluaci6n,
durante 1991 se detect6 ]a necesidad de ajustar el proyecto sin modificar sus objetivos, a fin de
adaptarlo a las necesidades reales del pais, asi como para acordar metas mas realistas. Esta
reformulacion redujo sustancialmente las metas fisicas del proyecto y confirm6 la
participaci6n del Banco en la conservaci6n normal por contrato.
Asi mismo fue necesaria prorrogar por un anio la fecha de cierre del prestamo, a fin de
completar el programa de capacitaci6n; con lo cual la vigencia del prestamo qued6
establecida para el 30 de junio de 1995.
La   implementaci6n   del  proyecto  tuvo   un   desfase  inicial  de   dos
afios, habi6ndose iniciado a partir de 1989. Las principales causas de este desfase fueron:
lo. -   El bajo presupuesto asignado a la conservaci6n en los inicios del proyecto,
que practicamente soloalcanzaba para mantener ocupada la plantilla de equipoy
de personal de la D.G.C.C. que ejecutaban obras por administracion; y, debido a
las circunstancias macroecon6micas no fue posible que se aumentara el
presupuesto de conservaci6n en 1987 en un 75% y posteriormente el 10%
anual, como se habia previsto.
2o.-   La falta de experiencia y motivacion de la Direcci6n General de Conservaci6n
en la contrataci6n de obras, dada la politica anterior de ejecutar las obras por
administraci6n.



- 52 -                                   i i.
3o.-   La falta de familiarizaci6n de las areas de la Direcci6n General de
Conservacifn sobre Jos ]ineamiiientos acordados con el Banco y en particular
los procedimientos para lograr la no objeci6n de financiamiento para las
diversas categorias que componian el proyecto, ya que fue el primer proyecto
en el que la D.G.C.C. particip6 de manera intensiva.
La implementaci6n del proyecto se caracteriz6 por tres periodos pricipales:
1987-1989.- El proyecto tuvo poca actividad y el desembolso del pre'stamo casi fue nulo (sin
considerar la cuenta especial). Este periodo se caracteriz6 por reducciones al presupuesto y el
cambio de tendencia en la ejecuci6n de obras, por administracion a contrato. Asi como del inicio
de la contrataci6n de la conservacion rutinaria. Tambien se puede observar la tendencia del
deterioro acelerado de la red.
1990 -1992.- En este perfodo se contrataron y realizaron la mayoria de las obras. Se caracteriz6
por el aumento sustancial de las asignaciones presupuestales y el desembolso de mas de las 3/4
partes del prestamo, repercutiendo en reducir el deterioro acelerado de la red y en la mejora de
la superficie de rodamiento. Asimismo, el incremento de obras a contrato y de la
contrataci6n de la conservaci6n rutinaria, habiendose Ilegado a la contratacion de 1/3 parte de la
red durante 1991 y 1992. Durante 1992 se di6 mayor enfasis al desarrollo institucional y se
caracteriz6 por la contrataci6n y desarrollo de  la fase inicial de los sistemas para la
administraci6n de pavimentos (Sister) y de puentes (Sipumex), asi como la elaboraci6n del
estudio para la reorganizaci6n de la Direcci6n General de Conservacion de Carreteras. Como
consecuencia de la concentraci6n de las cargas de trabajo en este periodo, se observaron
tambien mayores problemas en el procedimiento de las no objeciones, lo que trajo consigo
retrasos en obra por falta de oportunidad en el pago de anticipos; por lo que, es deseable se
revisen los mecanismos de no objeci6n de financiamiento a fin de acordar alternativas que
reduzcan los tiempos utilizados.
1993 - 1995. - Se caracteriz6 por la terminacion de las obras que quedaron pendientes al cierre
de 1992, sobre todo de algunos puentes; y, la implementaci6n del programa de capacitaci6n,
llegandose a obtener el uiltimo desembolso en febrero 1995.
Durante la implementaci6n del proyecto se observ6 una transformaci6n radical de la Direcci6n
General de Conservacion de Carretera s, puesto que de ser una entidad que en 1988 ejecutaba la gran
parte de su pregrama por administraci6n, actualmente un 80% de los trabajos los realiza a
traves de contrato.



- 53 -                                  iii .
Por otro lado. al iniciarse el proyecto despues de dos anos de lo programado. se observ6 que el
tipo de trabajos acordados originalmente se debia adecuar, dado que la red de carreteras se
estaba deteriorado de manera acelerada v se requerian de trabajos mas costosos. Las metas
fisicas del provecto. planteadas inicialmente. resultaron demasiado optimistas. esto motivado
porque. aparentemente. los costos por unidad utilizados en la preparaci6n del reporte de
evaluaci6n. corresponden a gastos de trabajos por administraci6n y. tal vez. a la falta de
informaci6n mas fidedigna por el extravfo de archivos, a raiz del sismo de 1985.
En virtud del desfase mencionado anteriormente, y de los bajos presupuestos asignados a la
Secretaria, que practicamente se utilizaban para atender los tramos mas deteriorados con
tratamientos que permitieran restituir lo mas rapido posible las condiciones de transitabilidad, a
fin de reducir los costos de operaci6n de las carreteras, el proyecto se fue adecuando
paulatinamente.
Desde el punto de vista financiero. una de las acciones principales que aseguraron el eiato en
cuanto al ejercicio de los recursos de credito externo, fue el hecho de que la Secretarfa de
Hacienda y Credito Puiblico a partir de 1989 implement6 candados presupuestales para los
recursos autorizados a obras financiadas con credito externo, los cuales deberian de ejercerse
previa la No Objeci6n del Banco Mundial a los contratos respectivos.
En otro orden de ideas, se puede constatar que los mecanismos de licitaci6n y contrataci6n de la
D.G.C.C., se han fortalecido notablemente. Al inicio del prestamo se observaba un falta de
experiencia en la contrataci6n de trabajos relativos a la conservaci6n de carreteras, sobre todo
en imprecisiones en cuanto a los tramos a atacar y a los trabajos por realizar, asi como en los
mecanismos de control y seguimiento de los contratos. Esto de alguna manera era producto de
la falta de experiencia de la entidad, ya que de ejecutor directo de las obras estaba pasando a
administrador de contratos. Actualmente se observa una convicci6n de esta area en cuanto a
realizar la mayorna de los trabajos por contrato. Tal vez, esto fue acelerado administrativamente
por las politicas dictadas por el Gobiemo Federal en materia del adelgazamiento de la
burocracia y por la desercion del personal, al presentarse otras oportunidades en la iniciativa
privada, de mayor rentabilidad econo6mica.
En cuanto a fortalecimiento institucional, se considera que el principal apoyo se encuentra en
los estudios iniciados en el marco del prestamo que nos ocupa, que tambien servir'an de apoyo
fundamental para sustentar el programa acordado con el Banco Mundial, en el marco del
pr6stamo 3628-ME. Estos son los estudios realizados por el consultor B.C.E.O.M., mediante el
cual se implement6 la la. etapa del modelo SISTER, que sirvi6 como base para estudiar una
serie de estrategias de conservaci6n para un plazo de 15 afios, ademas de demostrar de manera
pragmatica las xentajas y consecuencias de elegir una de las alternativas estudiadas. Otro de los
estudios importantes se refiere a la realizaci6n de la la. etapa de implantaci6n del Sistema
Mexicano de Puentes SIPUMEX; mediante el cual se han adquirido ciertas tecnicas de reNisifn

de estructuras v de iiventario de puentes: con ello. se estima que actualmente se tiene una
evaluaci6n actualizada y homogenea de todos los puentes del pais. Asi mismo. dentro de este
prestamo. se lev6 al cabo un estudjo sobre la estructura administrativa de la Direcci6n General
de Conservaci6n de Carreteras. mismo que deriv6 en una evaluaci6n de esta Direcci6n General
y en las propuestas de reorganizaci6n. Principalmente. estos estudios han venido a reforzar la
capacidad institucional de la D.G.C.C.
Por lo que respecta a metas fisicas, en materia de rehabilitaci6n de carreteras, estas fueron
alcanzadas de manera muy modesta, en virtud principalmente de la diferencia entre el tipo de los
trabajos estimados inicialmente para una red federal en condiciones regulares y los efectuados
en condiciones de raipido deterioro de la red. En materia de costos del proyecto. el costo final
fue de 11% mayor a lo previsto.
En cuanto a desembolsos del pr6stamo, estos se desarrollaron de manera muy desfasada con
respecto a los gastos que iba ejecutando la Secretaria, debido a la lentitud en la preparaci6n de
las solicitudes de desembolso.
Otro problema observado. se refiere al desembolso de los recursos en categorfas diferentes a la
del gasto realizado por esta Secretaria. Lo cual implica tener registros diferentes entre los
desembolsos estimados por esta Secretaria y los desembolsos que realiz6 Banobras.
Para realizar los analisis de las evaluaciones econ6micas expost, relacionadas con el credito
2875 -ME, se tom6 una muestra de 19 proyectos, de Rehabilitaci6n y Conservaci6n Peri6dica.
Los resultados obtenidos por la Direcci6n General de Planeaci6n demuestran que las
inversiones siguen siendo rentables, (con excepci6n del ramal Palizada proyecto 19), ya que se
obtuvieron Tasas Intenas de Retomo mayores al 12%.
No obstante las experiencias sefialadas, se considera que en terminos generales el proyecto se
implement6 de manera adecuada y que las experiencias obtenidas han servido como base para
la preparaci6n del siguiente prestamo sectorial de conservaci6n de carreteras.
Como principales experiencias y conclusiones del proyecto, se pueden senialar las siguientes:
1. - La contribuci6n del proyecto a mejorar la planeacion, programaci6n y presupuestaci6n del
los escasos recursos que se asignan a la conservaci6n de carreteras, asi como a mejorar la
administracion de los recursos.

2.-  Se considera  como contribuci6n fundamental del proyecto. el que haya servido de
catalizador de la inversion para que las autoridades superiores den mayor prioridad a los
proaramas de conservacion de carreteras: actualmente. se considera que este programa
tiene una de las mas attas prioridades del pais y que. apoyado por el prestamo 3628-ME.
seauird contando con esta prioridad.
3.-  En materia de control de obras, al cambiar la politica de ejecuci6n de obras por
administracifn a contrato, existe una mejor contabilidad de costos de obras. asi como de
los avances ffsicos que se van logrando en [as mismas. Esto ha contribuido a que cada dia
exista mayor convencimiento para trabajar la mayorna de los trabajos de conservacion por
contrato.
4.-  En cuanto a mnetas fisicas alcanzadas, se considera que el proyecto tuvo logros modestos,
principalmente por estimaciones demasiado optimistas en la evaluaci6n del proyecto, y por
adecuaciones necesarias para incentivar su implementaci6n; ya que en los primeros dos
anios no hubo movimiento alguno y el prestamo estuvo en peligro de cancelarse. No
obstante, su implementaci6n sirvi6 para reducir el deterioro de la red y sentar las bases
para impulsar la politica de rehabilitaci6n y reconstrucci6n de carreteras.
5.-  Por lo que respecta al perfil de desembolsos, el proyecto present6 un comportamiento muy
similar a lo planeado, sin detectarse diferencias apreciables, aunque para su
implementacion fue necesario utilizar un afio mas del periodo original (en lugar de
terminarse en 1994 se termnin6 en 1995).
6.- Desde el punto de vista de fortalecimiento institucional, se considera que Ia Direccion
General de Conservacion de Carreteras, alcanz6 logros importantes con la reorganizacion
derivada del estudio realizado por la empresa Mc. Kinsey; lo que permiti6 tener bases
mas adecuadas para reestructurar las areas y asignar las nuevas funciones.
7.- El comportamiento del Banco Mundial puede resumirse como de falta de verdaderos
especialistas en carreteras y de entendimiento de la idiosincracia y procedimientos locales
durante la preparaci6n y evaluaci6n del proyecto por una parte, y de flexibilidad,
continuidad y especializaci6n durante la implementaci6n del proyecto. En ambos casos el
personal del Banco Mundial mostr6 su mejor voluntad pam cooperar con la Secretarfa. A
pesar de esto, deben mejorarse los tiempos de respuesta del Banco Mundial a los
planteamientos que sobre la no objecion de financiamiento lleva al cabo esta Secretaria,
dado que Jos tiempos excesivos de respuesta repercuten directamente en la ejecuci6n de
las obras. provocando  incumplirniento de esta  Secretaria  en  los compromisos
que st. padcfn en los contratos, sobre todo en materia de pago de anticipos.

8.- Con base en los resuttados de las evaluaciones econ6micas practicada. se deduce que el
proyecto siaue siendo rentable desde el punto de vista econ6mico. ya que se obtuvieion
tasas internas de retorno superiores al 12%.
9.-  En cuanto a la continuidad del proyecto en el tiempo, se considera que los objetivos
planteados seguirdn adelante con o sin financiamiento externo ya que la politica al
mediano plazo es obtener una red en 6ptimas condiciones de transitabilidad, para reducir
al rninimo los costos de operaci6n de los vehiculos, asf como eficientar la asignacion de los
recursos para realizar inversiones mas rentables que soporten el desarrollo del pais de la
mejor manera posible. En materia de ejecuci6n de contratos se estima que se seguira
utilizando de manera preponderante el sistema de licitaci6n y contrataci6n de obras y de los
servicios requeridos.

SUMMARY
(English version translated from the original)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT: LOAN 2875-ME
HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.   INTRODUCTION
Loan Agreement 2875-ME was signed on November 4, 1987 for an amount of US$135
million, and became effective on February 2, 1988, the purpose being to support a five-year
investment program (1987-91). The loan period was originally intended to run until June 30,
1994, and the main objective was to support the Government and the SCT in improving highway
maintenance on the federal network, overcoming the backlog of periodic maintenance, and
promoting the implementation of cost recovery policies.
Given the optimistic physical and financial estimates contained in the Appraisal Report, in
1991 it became clear that the project should be reformulated to bring it into line with the country's
actual needs and to make its goals more realistic, while maintaining the original objectives. As a
result, the physical targets of the project were substantially modified and the Bank's role in
questions relating to the contracting of routine maintenance was reasserted.
Similarly, the closing date of the loan had to be postponed by one year, in order to
complete the training program. Consequently, the loan was closed on June 30, 1995.
II.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project implementation was delayed by two years, beginning in 1989. The following were
the main causes of this delay:
1.    The budget allocations for maintenance at the beginning of the
project were sufficient only for works executed on force account using DGCC's
staff and equipment. Macroeconomic conditions made it impossible to increase the
maintenance budget by the planned 75% in 1987 and 10% in subsequent years.
2.    Because of the earlier policy of carrying out works by force
account, DGCC lacked experience and motivation in contracting.
3.    DGCC lacked familiarity with Bank procedures, particularly those
for obtaining the Bank's "no objection" to the release of funds for the various
project categories, this being the first project in which DGCC had had a major
role.



- 58 -
Project implementation fell into the following three main phases:
1987-89:    Little progress was made and there was almost no disbursement
(disregarding the special account). This period was characterized by budget cuts
and a trend away from force account to contracting, including the beginnings of
contracting out routine maintenance. At the same time, the network itself was
rapidly deteriorating.
1990-92:    Most of the contracting and execution of works took place in this
period, during which budget allocations substantially increased and more than
three fourths of the loan funds were disbursed, with a corresponding slowdown in
the rapid deterioration of the network and improvements in pavement surfacing.
By 1991 and 1992, the contracting of works and routine maintenance accounted
for one third of the network. In 1992, greater emphasis was placed on institutional
development, and the year was highlighted by the contracting of consultants for
the initial phases of the pavement management system (SISTER) and the bridge
management system (SIPUMEX), together with the preparation of a study for the
reorganization of DGCC. Because the work load was concentrated in this period,
more problems arose over "no objection" procedures, so that advances were not
paid in a timely manner and works were therefore delayed. "No objection"
procedures should therefore be revised, so that alternative courses of action can be
agreed upon and time saved.
1993-95:    During this period, the works left outstanding after 1992 (i.e.
mainly bridges) were completed, and the training program was implemented. The
final disbursement was in February 1995.
During implementation, DGCC was radically transformed. In 1988, most of its programs
were being executed by force account, while currently 80% of the work is contracted.
In addition, because the project was delayed by two years, the type of work originally
provided for had to be changed, since the network was rapidly deteriorating and required more
expensive treatment. The original physical targets proved to be too optimistic, apparently because
the unit costs used in the Appraisal Report were based on force account operations, and perhaps
because of the lack of more reliable data due to the loss of records in the 1985 earthquake.
In view of the delay -- and also the low budget allocations assigned to the Secretariat,
which were practically used up in making the stretches in worst condition serviceable again as
soon as possible, so as to reduce highway operating costs -- the project was gradually modified
to meet the real needs.
As regards financing, one of the main factors ensuring that the external loan funds were
successfully applied was the implementation from 1989 onward by the Secretariat of the Treasury



- 59 -
and Public Credit of measures tying budgetary funding for certain works to the actual use of
external loans. Such funding was to be provided once the World Bank's "no objection" to the
contracts concerned had been received.
DGCC's bidding and contracting mechanisms were considerably strengthened. At the
beginning of the loan period, the agency showed a lack of experience in contracting out the
various highway maintenance activities, particularly with regard to specifying the sections to be
maintained and tasks to be performed and carrying out supervision and monitoring. This by no
means reflected a lack of basic experience on the part of the agency, but was the result of the
transition from force account to contracting. Currently, however, it is clear that the will exists to
have most works performed under contract, and this change possibly came about more rapidly
both because of the Federal Government's policy of slimming down the bureaucracy, and because
many employees left the agency for better paid jobs in the private sector.
As regards institutional strengthening, the main support has been provided by the studies
prepared for this project, which will also be essential for the Highway Rehabilitation and
Resurfacing Program agreed upon under World Bank Loan No. 3628-ME. These studies were
prepared by the consultant BCEOM, who provided support for the implementation of the first
stage of the SISTER model, which was used to prepare a number of 15-year maintenance
strategies and to select one on the basis of a clear presentation of its advantages and results.
Another of these important studies concerned the first stage of the SIPUMEX (bridge
management system), which has provided techniques for examining structures and establishing
what is by now an up-to-date and homogeneous inventory of all the bridges in the country.
Similarly, the project included a study of DGCC's management structure, leading to an evaluation
of the agency and proposals for its reorganization. In the main, these studies have served to
strengthen DGCC's institutional capacity.
As regards the physical objectives of highway rehabilitation, the achievements were
modest, mainly because of the differences between the type of work that it was originally assumed
would be appropriate for the federal network and the work actually carried out on the rapidly
deteriorating system. Project cost was 11% more than planned.
Disbursement lagged very much behind the Secretariat's expenditures, because of delays in
the preparation of applications for withdrawal of funds.
A further problem concerned the disbursement of finds among project categories different
to those recorded by the SCT. This meant different disbursement records for SCT and Banobras.
The economic evaluation analysis for loan 2875-ME was based on a sample comprising 19
rehabilitation and periodic maintenance projects. The findings of the Directorate General of
Planning show that the investments (except for Project 19: Ramal Palizada) continue to be
economically sound, with ERRs of more than 12%.



- 60 -
In spite of the various factors noted, in general the project was properly implemented and
the experience has served as a basis for the preparation of the next highway maintenance sector
loan.
III.   KEY LESSONS LEARNED AND CONCLUSIONS
The following are the key lessons learned and the conclusions to be drawn from the
project:
1.    The project helped improve both the planning, programnming and budgeting of the
meager resources provided for highway maintenance, and the management of those
resources.
2.    A basic contribution of the project was to catalyze investment, inducing the
Government to prioritize highway maintenance programs. Currently, this program is
regarded as a high national priority, and will continue to be so when supported by loan
3628-ME.
3.    As regards works supervision, the change of policy from force account to
contracting has improved the cost accounting of works and the monitoring of physical
progress, contributing to an increasing willingness to contract out most maintenance work.
4.    As regards physical objectives, success was moderate, mainly because of the
overoptimistic estimates made at Appraisal and the adaptations that became necessary to
promote implementation, given that there was no movement in the first two years and the
loan was in danger of being canceled. Nevertheless, the project reduced the deterioration
of the network and provided a basis for the policy of rehabilitating and repairing highways.
5.    The pattern of disbursements went largely according to plan, without any
appreciable deviations, although implementation took one year longer than originally
planned (i.e. it was completed in 1995 instead of 1994).
6.    As regards institutional strengthening, DGCC achieved considerable success in
reorganizing itself in line with the recommendations of the study by the McKinsey
company, and this provided it with a suitable basis for restructuring the various areas of
responsibility and assigning the newly revised functions.
7.    During project preparation and appraisal, the World Bank's perfornance was
characterized by a lack of real expertise with regard to roads or any understanding of local
realities and procedures, but during project implementation it showed flexibility, continuity
and specialization. Although at both stages Bank staff showed a real willingness to
cooperate with the SCT, the institution must improve its response time when dealing with
the SCT's calls for the Bank's "no objection" to financing, since any delay directly affects



- 61 -
the execution of works and prevents the SCT from fulfilling its contractual duties,
particularly with respect to the payment of advances.
8.    The economic evaluations show that the project continues to produce an economic
return, with IRRs of more than 12%.
9.    As regards project sustainability, the objectives will continue to be pursued with or
without external financing, since the medium-term aim is to provide the most serviceable
network possible, thus reducing vehicle operating costs to a minimum and increasing the
efficiency of resource allocation, making investment more profitable so as to provide the
best possible support for national development. It is assumed that works and services will
continue to be provided predominantly through the system of bidding and contracting.
