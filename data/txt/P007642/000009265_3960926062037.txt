4EMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE BANCO NACIONAL DE OBRAS PUBLICAS Y SERVICIOS
GUARANTEED BY THE UNITED STATES OF MEXICO
FOR A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
TO BE EXECUTED BY LA SECRETARIA DE COMUNICACIONES Y TRANSPORTES
1.        The following report on a proposed Loan to the Banco Nacional de
Obras y Servicios (BANOBRAS) for US$135 million equivalent for a Highway
Maintenance Project to be executed by the Secretariat of Communications and
Transport (SCT) is submitted for approval. This proposed Loan would be
repaid over 15 years, including 3 years of grace, at the standard variable
interest rate.
2.        Background.  In response to the accelerated growth in traffic
throughout the 1970s, Mexico initiated a program to relieve congestion and
improve the condition of its road system. The economic crisis that began in
1982 has resulted in major reductions in the funds available for transport
investments, particularly roads, forcing a reorientation of the highway
program--focussing more on maintenance and less on relieving congestion.
While sufficient funds have generally been made available for routine road
maintenance, the economic crisis and budgetary restrictions of the last few
years have resulted in neglect of necessary periodic maintenance of federal
roads and bridges, and a backlog of urgent maintenance works has built up.
In addition, present maintenance policies are less than optimal in terms of
cost-effectiveness and maximization of economic benefits, and, maintenance
planning and management need to be improved. In order to halt the resulting
rapid deterioration of roads, the Government is embarking on a five-year
maintenance improvement program wlich the proposed project loan would
support.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Bank loans in the highway
subsector, including the ongoing Second Highway Sector Project (Loan
2428-ME), have focussed on Mexico's road construction and modernization
programs, in an attempt to ensure the application of appropriate technical
and economic evaluation criteria and to carry on a dialogue concerning
general sector policies. While the ongoing Highway Sector Project has been
reoriented to include an expanded road strengthening program covering
critically weak sections of the federal network, there is a need for
extending the Bank's technical and financial support directly to road
maintenance. The proposed project would focus on overall maintenance and the
institutional improvements required, as well as other deferred maintenance
needs, and would complement the ongoing sector project. The Project is
consistent with the Bank's country strategy by focussing on the
rationalization of public sector expenditures, while ensuring that
Infrastructure is in a satisfactory condition to support the economic
recovery, including the development of non-oil exports.



-2-
4.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project would, primarily, assist
the Government and SCT In Improving road maintenance operations for the
federal network, so that the present backlog of deferred periodic maintenance
can be eliminated and, in future, maintenance requirements can be provided on
a timely basis. In addition, the project would promote appropriate
institutional and operational efficiencies and cost recovery policies for
road users.
5.        Project Description.  The project would help to support the
Government's five-year Federal Road Maintenance Improvement Program
(1987-1991). Financing would be provided for a portlon of that program and
would Include: (a) periodic malntenance of paved federal roads and bridges;
(b) provision of new, improved or expanded workshop facilities, including
required machinery, tools and spare parts; tc) procurement of road
maintenance equipment; (d) implementation of SCT's equipment overhaul and
rehabilitation program; (e) training in equipment operation, repair and
maintenance and in road maintenance planning and operations; and (f)
consulting services for training and for studies and technical support to
upgrade maintenance planning, design and execution. The estimated total cost
of the project is US$281.5 million equivalent, about 31% of the cost of the
Government's five-year Federal Road Maintenance Improvement Program. Of the
project costs, US$135 million (48%) are foreign costs. Schedule A shows the
breakdown of project costs and the proposed financing plan. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement and the disbursement schedule are
presented in Schedule B. The timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6634-ME, dated May 20, 1987, is
also attached.
6.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreement was reached with
BANOBRAS and the Government on the following: (a) annual consultations to be
held on the highway sector expenditure program to ensure an appropriate
balance between construction, rehabilitation and maintenance; the annual
program to be satisfactory to the Bank; (b) carrying out of a Road User Cost
Recovery Scheme to recover road damages attributable to trucks and other
heavy vehicles; (c) the proposed Federal Road Maintenance Improvement
Program, its scope and composition, methodologies and technical and economic
criteria used to be satisfactory to the Bank with annual consultations to be
held to review each yearly program; (d) works to be included in the first
year program; (e) provision of necessary budgetary resources to carry out the
Federal Road Maintenance Improvement Program; (f) scope and composition of
the training program; (g) scope and timing of consulting services, outline
terms of reference and estimated cost; th) equipment procurement program,
workshop construction and improvement program and the equipment scrapping
program; (i) physical and operational targets to be achieved to help the
executing agency manage, monitor and evaluate the progress of the Federal
Road Maintenance Improvement Program; and (j) procurement procedures for
works, goods and services to be financed under the Project.
7.        Agreement was also reached on: (a) the 1987-88 Annual Project
Implementation Schedule and the methodologies and technical and economic



- 3 -
criteria to be used for updatIng the subsequent Annual Project Implementatlon
Schedules to ensure that the objectives of the project are achieved
efficiently; and (b) project reporting requirements. It will be a condition
of loan effectiveness that the Borrower and the Guarantor enter into
contractual arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the transfer of loan
funds.
8.        Benefits.  Experience of the Bank's Borrowers clearly shows not
only that neglect or deferral of maintenance produces higher capital, repair,
and rehabilitation costs, along with shortened facility life, but that
provision of adequate and timely maintenance results in reductions in road
user costs. Economic rates of return are well above the opportunity cost of
capital, especially for high traffic roads, as in Mexico, where over half of
the federal network carries more than 2,000 vehicles per day.   Quantified
economic benefits derive from vehicle operating cost savings from improved
road conditions. The economic evaluation of the pluriannual road maintenance
program found an overall economic rate of return of above 40%. Maintenance
strategies which have been selected would set the priority among road
sections of the maintenance program, thus maximizing overall economic
benefits.
9.        Risks.  There are three main risks with regard to the Project.  The
first concerns the possible failure by the Government to allocate sufficient
budgetary funds on a timely basis. However, this risk is mitigated by the
Government's agreement to hold annual consultations on road investments and
to provide the necessary budgetary resources to carry out the Federal Road
Maintenance Improvement Program.  The second, concerning the Road User Cost
Recovery Scheme, involves the possibility that future progress on this policy
issue may face political resistance, particularly regarding increases in
taxes to fully recover the cost of soad damage attributable to trucks and
other heavy vehicles. However, the Government has taken a series of measures
to increase taxes on trucks in the 1987 tax law, including an initial 130%
increase in road tolls for trucks which are to b. further raised to bring the
total increase to 260% in 1987, as well as substantial increases in annual
truck permit taxes. Also, the prlce of diesel fuel has been lncreased by
130% during the past year to bring it close to border prices. In light of
the foregoing, and the Government's agreement tG implempnt the Road User Cost
Recovery Scheme and raise user taxes on tricks and other heavy vehicles to
cover at least the related marginal costs attributable to them, this risk is
also acceptable. Lastly, there is the risk that the institutional
strengthe:ing aspects will not be given the necessary priority. Project
preparation has proceeded in close collaborition with Government authorities
in order to ensure commitment to objectives and minimize these risks.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
