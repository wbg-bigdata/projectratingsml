PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NICARAGUA - Loan 1244-NI
Second Education Project
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) derives from: (a) a Bank
Project Completion field mission of 4 staff/weeks; (b) a review of a Project
Completion Report prepared by the Borrower; and (c) a review of material in
Bank files, notably project related correspondence and mission reports, the
Appraisal Report (No. lOO3a-NI of March 26, 1976); the President's Report
(No. P-1808-NI, of March 31,1976), the Loatn Agreement (Loan 1244-NI of June
15, 1976) and the subsequent amendments thereto. This PCR draws
substantialla, especially in regard to physical implementation aspects, on
the PCR prepared by the Borrower with which there is general agreement.
Where Bank perceptions are at variance with opinions and conclusions
expressed in the Borrower's POR these are appropriately documented in the
present report. The Bank completion mission visited five of the six project
regions including a selected sample of nuclei, base and satellite schools and
basic secondary institutions. It held discussions with officials of the
Ministries of Education, Planning, Construction and Finance, with project
implementation staff and in the field with chief administrative officers and
staffs at regional (Delegado Regional), Zone (Delgado Zonal) and nucleo
(Director ITER) levels, and with teachers, community leaders, and school
principals. The report which follows highlights project implementation
issues, project outcomes, conclusions and recommendations of the mission.
The Operations Evaluation Department decided not to audit the
project and sent the PCR to the Government in October 1983.  No comments
have been received from the Government.

HIGHLIGHTS
Identified in 1972 (para 1.04), preparation of the Second Educationi
Project was postponed until 1975 because of the country's need to concentrate
its resources to reconstruction efforts following the December 1972
earthquake which destroyed Managua, the capital city. Loan 1.244-NI which was
approved in April 1976, supported the Governyiient's rural education and
training development strategy (para 1.01) by (i) improving and expanding
rural basic education opportunities, and decentralizing education management,
(ii) increasing agricultural training to meet the manpower needs of the
v         sector, and (iii) improving teacher qualifications.
The agreed project (para 1.02) included provision of (i) a total of
204 primary schools organized into 18 rural primary education nuclei composed
of "base", "sub-base" and "associated" schools; (ii) 18 lower secondary
schools; (iii) 9 agricultural training centers; and (iv) 4 agricultural
secondary schools. The project also included an upgrading program for 1,100
teachers and administrators, technical assistance and fellowships of 11 and
17 man-years respectively. Following the 1979 civil war, the project content
was reduced, the entire agricultural training component was deleted, and the
repair and refurnishing of 22 Diversified Secondary Schools damaged during
the civil war was added to the project. In a subsequent loan amendment,
three lower secondary schools were added, and two nuclei deleted.
The project as revised, has been satifactorily completed and has
rendered substantial benefits to the system as a whole (para 4.01). Cost
effective, easy to construct and maintain schools (para 2.05 and 2.06) were
designed, built and equipped under the project providing new places for
13,680 primary and 5,200 secondary school students, exceeding the targ,.ts by
about 8'" A successful community-assisted school building program (para 2.07
and 2.08) was undertaken, providing invaluable experience in implementation
mechanisms at grass roots level.  The project had an effective institution
building effect; the project unit has become an efficient and important
project implementation arm of the Ministry of Education (para 2.04). With
respect to educational aspects, the school nuclearization scheme (para 3.02)
has been made operational and teachers trained (para 2.13, 216 and 3.11) and
retrained in the areas of multigrade teaching and practical arts. In
addition, the technical assistance (para 2,14) and fellowships (para 2.15)
programs have provided guidance and training to a sufficient degree in the
areas of education administration, nuclearization, and science and language
teaching.
The project, however, has been less successful in several aspects.
Although nuclearization has been established, the new decentralized regional
administrative structure is operating ineffectively and without precise
definition of linkages and responsibilities of each management level (para
3.02), thereby militating against cost effective and sound educational
practices. The envisioned network of regional secondary education system has
not materialized.   Although appraisal enrollment targets (para 3.09) have
been achieved and show signs of increase, internal efficiency has not
improved above the rates existing at the time of appraisal (para 3.04-3.07).
The system of continuous evaluation (para 2.17) of education and training
programs has not been established. In the areas of teacher training,
mathematics teaching was not undertaken (para. 2.17), and technical



- vii -
assistance in school nuclearization (para 2.14) was of insufficient depth.
With hindsight, some of the problem could have been minimized at an early
stage such as by conducting an in-depth review of sclhool mapping before
reaumption of implementat:Lon (para 2.11) after the civil war when it became
apparent; that population had shifted subs.oantially. This sttudy could have
preenmpted the current confusion and diseconomy in the educational
orginizational structure and over or under utilization of some facilities.
The Government should give immediate attentioa to these organizational
problems and the still low inLternal efficiency of the education system.
Although the project 1had a time overrun of two years (para 2.02)
and a total cost of 21% above appraisal estimates (paras 2.18 and 2.19)
project implementation and disbursemnent performance (para 2.21) have been
remarkable, especially during the last 2.5 years of implementation,
considering the adverse effects of the 1972 earthquake from which the country
had not fully recovered and the 1979 civil war which further aggravated
economic difficulty.  On the  whole, both the Borrower's and the Bank's
performance have been satisfactory. The Bank's flexibility in considering
modifications to project content and facilitating disbursements througlh
increased disbursement percentages (para 2.21) during a difficult economic
period, and the new Government's ready allocation of scarce resources to this
project considered of high priority, have made possible the generally
successful conclusion of this project. Bank participation in this project
has been a worthwhile investment. Further external assistance is, however,
necessary to effect qualitative improvements in the system (para 4.02) by
providing instructional materials and textbooks, teacher/administrator
upgrading programs and assistance in curriculum development.
The following points may be of particular interest to Bank Staff
and the Borrower:
(a) the successful community involvement in rural primary school
construction under direct supervision by the project unit (para
2.07 and 2.08);
(b)  the effectiveness of the use of an increased disbursement rate at
the initial siage of project implementation without necessarily
increasing the Bank's overall participation in financing total
project cost (para 2.21);
(c)  the stability of the project unit staff not withstanding a change
in government (para 2.04);
(d)  the need to review school mapping and school locations when
substantial delays in start of ixplementation have occurred and
unexpected population shifts may have taken place (para 2.11);
(e)  distorcions in the educational organizational structure which could
result from unplanned school growth/expansion (para 3.02);
(f)  too theoretical approaches in the work of expatriate consultants as
a possible outcome of unfamiliarity with the couLntry (pare 2.14);
and
(g)  the importance of educational software (such as textbooks, teacher
tr;ainingt and curriculumn development) in improving educational
rpi;d.ity and iriternal efficienicy (para 3.04, 3.11 and 3.12).



I.  BACKGROUND AND CONTENT OP THE PROJECT
Project ObJectives
1.01      The project was designed to support the government's rural
education and training development strategy by:
(a)  improving and expanding rural primary education opportunities under
an innovative nuclear school system;
(b)  increasing agricultural training opportunities by establishing
non-formal training facilities in selected areas and supporting the manpower
needs of the agricultural sector by establishing agricultural secondary
schools;
(c)  expanding and improving rural secondarj educational opportunities
through a restructured regional secondary education system; and
(d) improving the quality of education through in-service teacher
training and a cechnical assistanca program.
Project Content/Revisions
1.02      During project implementation, the project content was modified
twice (April 1, 1980 and October 9, 1981).  Details of the original project
content and the subsequent amendments are shown in Table 1.1. Changes were
made for the following reasons:
(a) First Revision: Following the 1979 civil strife, the Government
was in a precarious economic situation and needed to concentrate
its meager resources. The deletion of the entire agricultural training
component was requested as this was considered to have a lower priority than
the basic education component. l/ Many buildings were damaged during the
civil war, among them, the Diversified Secondary Schools (IREMs) built uinder
Loan 532-NI.  Repairs of these schools and tha replacement of lost/damaged
furniture and equipment were therefore added in the revision of the project.
A revolving fund was established.
(b)  Second Revision:  Two Rural School Nuclei (NERs) in Zelaya,
comprising 18 primary schools were located in remote areas without access.
The government undertook to build these schools with its own resources and
requested deletion of these 18 schools from the project.  Three additional
Lower Secondary Schools (CIBAs) were added in areas where the Ministry of
Education (MED) found the greatest need for these schools. Force account
procedures ware included in the Loan Agreement.
1/ The importance, although of secondary priority, attached by the
Government to the agricultural training component, is evidenced
by its inclusion in tne aborted Third Education Project.

1.03      The loan proceeds were reallocated accordingly, final allocations
are shown in detail in the Basic Data Sheet.  During implementation, the Bank
agreed to other minor revisions involving the transfer of school locations
either due to difficulties in obtaining school Sites or to population shifts.
Project  'eneration
1.04      The project identification stage took twice as long (3 years) as
the average education project (1.5 years) due to the divergent views of the
UNESCO programming mission and 'che Borrower, and the adverse conditions
brought about by the Managua earthquake in December, 1972. The first rmention
in files of a possible Second Education Project occurs on January 7, 1972
when a tentative selection of personnel for a UNESCO KID mission was being
considered.  A report was subsequently received detailing the findings of the
RID mission which identified as priority the development of general
secondary, vocational training and agricultural schools. The Governmnent
viewed these findings as inconaistent with its educational development plan
and priority needs. A Bank reeonnaissance mission that was mounted in
February 1973 to resolve the divergent views of UNESCO and the Borrower
concerning project content, recommended that the second project be postponed
to FY76 because of (a) delays in the implementation of the First Education
Project (Lioan 532-NI); (b) the Government's constrained implementation
capacity due to the reconstruction projects underway after the disastrous



-3-
earthquake; (o) the need to reexamine the country's priority educational
needs and in that contpxt, possible project content.
1.05      Preparation and appraisal missions left in July and August 1975
respectively and after that date, the project was processed efficiently. The
Loan Agreement was signed on June 15, 1976 and became effective in August 17,
1976 when the appointment of project unit staff, a condition for loan
effecti'veness, was approved by the Bank.
II. Project Implementation
2.01      :n the context of the devastating earthquake of 1972, the unsettled
conditions of the mid-1970s which culminated in the 1979 civil war and the
economic constraints which have wracked Nicaragua ever since, physical
implementation can be described as generally very satisfactory.The Government
has complied with most of the covenants of the Loan Agreement (Annex 1).
2.02      Iuplementation Period.  Project implementation took 6.5 years to
complete (Annex 2) from the date of loan signature or 44% (2 years)  beyond
that estimated at appraisal. This is an average period for the education
projects approved in the mid-1970s. A remarkable difference in the rate of
project implementation before and atter the 1979 civil war is,however,
noteworthy. For almost 4.5 years from August 1976 (effectiveness date) to
December 1979, only about 5% of the project had been executed. Standard
school building plans, bid documents and equipment lists had been completed,
but little civil works had been iuitiated: two NERs and one EAC (Agricultural
Secondary School which was subsequently deleted from the project ) were
contracted and some technical assistance rendered. The first set of schools
were tendered ili April 1978 - nine months later than scheduled at appraisal
for the first phase.   Delays at this stage were dua to site acquisition and
relocation problems, the additional time needed for design modifications, and
delays in the transmittal of correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrower. By July 1978, the socio-political situation in Nicaragua had badly
deteriorated and adversely affected implementation: (a) the expected 1978 and
1979 budget allocations were not received; (b) contractors were reluctant to
participate in bids for fear that payments would not be forthcoming; and (c)
building materials were difficult to obtain even at inflated prices. The
outbreak of the civil war in mid-1979 paralyzed project implementation for
the next six months.
2.03      Project implementation effectively commenced only around May 1980
under the new government after the first modification of project content
(Para 1.02). During the 2.5 year period up to the closing date, virtually
the entire project as modified was completed and the remaining loan funds
(95%) disbursed. Although, completion of the preparation activities (i.e.,
school plans, bid documents, equipment lists) prior to the civil war greatly
facilitated project implementation during the post-war period (it would have
taken about 18 months longer to complete the project had these activities not
been accomplished), credit for the remarkable implementation performance
during this period should be shared both by the Bank and the Government. The
Bank displayed comprehension of, and a flexible approach to the
socio-economic problems of Nicaragua such as: (a) readily agreeing to the
Borrower's proposal to concentrate its meager resources on basic education,



- 4 -
and therefore to eliminate frnm the project the agricultural education and
training component; l/and (b) agreeing to an accelerated disbursement rate
(para 2.21), thus providing much needed funding at the time the Government
faced difficulties in providing counterpart funds.  To the credit of the
present Government are: (a) its ready endorsement of a project formulated by
a previous administration (politically unacceptable to the current one); and
(b) the high priority it has accorded to the project, significantly reducing
internal bureaucratic procedures. Unlike the 4 years preceeding the civil
war, the new Government  promptly provided human and financial resources on a
generous scale not previously available to the PIU for efficient project
implenentation. All major implementation activity had effectively been
terminated as of December 31, 1982 with the exception of CIBA-18 (RAMA) which
the Government has undertaken the responsibility to complete by July 1983.
2.04       Project management.  The uncharacteristic stabilitv of the project
unit contributed substantially to efficient project implementation. The
DGIAF (Department of Investments and Financial Assistance), charged with
responsibility for project execution, was reconstituted under the new
government into DEPE (Directorate for the Execution of Education Projects)
of MED.  Notwithstanding the change in government, DEPE retained most key
staff of DGIAF (project director, architect, accountant) and thus achieved
consistency in decision making on implementation matters throughout the life
of the project. Their expertise, dedication, and success in attracting
active community participation in rural areas, have been a significant and
positive factor in prcject implementation.   DEPE continues to be the
important ann of the Ministry of Education to implement locally and
externally financed projects.
2.05       School Construction.  Implementation of this component was the most
successful in the project in spite of problems with school sites, contrnetors
and cost overruns.  By the closing date (December 1982), about 98% of the
revised total schools to be built and/or provided with additional facilities
had been satisfactorily completed. Table 2.1 compares the facilities which
have actually been provided with both appraisal and revised targets (see
Annex 3 for details).

2.06       In general, the schools provided are econoraical, simple and
appropriate for the level of instruction involved.  They are easy to build
and maintain due to the adaptation of standardized NER and CIBA school
designs which make maximum use of locally available materials.  The modular
designs developed by consultants hired under this project which were further
simplified on recommendations of the Bank, require little specialized skills
to construct or maintain, facilitate the expansion of school buildings and
are easily adaptable to varying site conditions. The simple designs have
made possible the successful involvement of the commurLity in school
construction.
2.07      Community Assistance in School Construction.  The niew governnent's
active endorsement of developing participatory planning and implementation
mechanisms at grass roots level has resulted in wide-spread voluntary
community involvement in school construction and maintenance, and in local
infrastructure development. Direct comm.unity involvement in school building
was envisioned at appraisal, but the Loan Agreement did not provide
procedures allowing its use. Because of civil works cost overruns (then
estimated at about 45%) brought about by the unsettled political and economic
situation (and scarce materials), the Government was prompted in late 1978 to
request Bank approval for use of community assistance in building schools in
order to reduce cost>;  CARE would assist DGIAF.  The Bank agreed to try out
the system in Boaco on a pilot basis (with 6 schools), with a view to
expanding the use of community assistance if found successful. The civil war
suspended further use of assistance of this nature. Thus community
involvement in school construction only came to be realized in 1981 when DEPE
made concrete steps to organize the process after no consl 2ction tenders
were received for rural schools in areas of difficult access. The Bank
supported the process by amending the Loan agreement so as to enable DEPE to
use a force account method or direct administration in civil works.  NED,
through DEPE, delivered building materials to rural communities and
contributed technical expertise by assigning project staff and clerks of
works full time on school sites to supervise the labor voluntarily
contributed by the community. Where building materials CDuld not be
delivered due to lack of access, the community undertook the hauling of
materials from the last accessible delivery points to the school site and in
some cases even built access roads to the proposed sites. Fifty out of the
184 primary schools were built by the communities, with schools ranging in
size from one classroom schools to a central school complete with classrooms,
workshops, laboratory and administrative areas. Schools built by the
community show construction savings of as much as 60%; they are at Least
equal in quality and better maintained than those built under contract with
private firms. There are indications too that the involvement is benefitting
student participation and retention rates due to the increased awareness of
the rural community of the benefits of education, and parental interest
in ensuring that their children enjoy the faoilities they have helped to
build.
2.08      A number of factors contributing to the success of the community
involvement in school construction under this project are normally not found
in other projects: (a) just prior to the civil war, the country gained
successful exper-ience in a CARE assisted rural school construction project
wnaee about 300 classrooms were built with community assistance;  procedures



- 6 -
were therefore already established and tested; (b) the country had recently
emerged from a civil war in which ordinary citizens easily identified
themselves with the overthrow of an old system of government and the
establishment of a socially-oriented government, and encouraged by the new
government, readily translated community participation in school construction
to lending a direct hand in nation building. The same identification
motivates the "promotores" of MED who organize working groups in the
community and selflessly supervise the work often under harsh living
conditions; (c) nuclei directors, who were already in place where the process
had been introduced, greatly assisted in motivating the community.  The
implications of such self-help practices for improved living standards and
for cost-effective, quality education should not be lost upon the Bank and
other Borrowers.
2.09      The use of force account and direct administration of civil works
using community assistance has been successful under this project, and in
hindsight, wider use of this procedure could have significantly lowered total
project  0ost and reduced the problems and disputes with small c.ntractors.
Following the civil war, many large contracting firms were disaolv.id as a
result of unstable econoaic conditions in the country.  The majority of
school buildiag contracts were therefore won by small firms which w1b-e
technically capable, could generally count on only limited financial
resources.  As the majority (about 65%) of the schools built weve snall and
in widely dispersed, often isolated locations, difficulties ani delays in
delivery of building materials, sometimes aggravated by adverse weather
cordaitions, were often encountered by these small contractors. Misputes
between contractors and DEPE were not infrequent. Although only about 3% of
the contracts awarded to private contractors were eventually abandoned, DEPE
nevertheless was left to complete the works under direct administration and
had to cDntend with the delays incurred and the resultant increased costs.
2.10  School Locations/Sizes_ In general, most schools were properly located
and accessible to the communities they intended to serve, although there are
cases where mislocation became apparent at the later stage of project
implementation.  Vith respect to school sizes, the areas provided per student
place are adequate and compare favorably with appraisal figures and Bank-wide
statistics for education facilities of the same type (Table 2.2), with the
exception of some schools where apparent mislocation (paras 2.11 and 3.03)
h1a: resulted in overcrowding or oversizing.  Efficient planning and reduction
of circulation areas reduced unit areas under the project.
Table 2.2 Unit Gross Areas Per Student Place (sq. m.)

2.11  Tn hindsight, it is clear that the long interval between project
definition and execution, and the trauma of the civil war in betwieen.
produced significant population movements in the rural areas which resulted
in apparent mislocation of schools with implications for the appropriateness



-7-
of their size and capacity.  In the rush to make up for lost implementation
time, a review of school locations (which to its credit was started by DGIAF
before the civil war) was done in so cursory a manner that some of the
schools then being completed were either too small/big for the student
population or improperly located. Although adjustments were Lndeed made in
late 1981 to correct deficiencies, it was too late for some of the already
built oversized schools.  It would be appropriate to reappraise school
locations and capacities, particularly where substantial time has elapsed
between loan signature and start of project implementation.
2.12       Two other issues related to the location and size of construction
emerged: the appropriateness of multi-purpose rooms and staff houses. (a) A
covered multi-purpose area of 24 sq.m. (capacity not indicated at appraisal),
was planned to be added to existing rural primary schools in the project area
which had an adequate number of classrooms and required no remodeling or
repair work. Early in project implementation (1979-1981) after some of these
areas were constructed, it was found that either (i) the spaces were unusable
because they were too small, or (ii) it was difficult to annex these areas
usefully to existing buildings unless designs were altered in each case.
Finally, the covered areas in some schools were increased to classroom size
(accommodating 40 students) to be of practical use, and in others, no
construction was done. Both solutions were satisfactory. (b) Staff houses
(53 for NERs and 18 for CIBAs) were to be provided under the project for
school directors (Annex 3). Although the designs are simple and adequate for
their intended use, about half of the 59 staff houses actually provided are
either unused or have been converted into other uses such as office space,
student activity room, storage or classroom.  Reasons for the disuse are
either (i) school directors are residents of the commnunity or nearby and thus
have no need for another house, (ii) the houses are either too small or too
large for the size of the school staff's family, or (iii) the intended user
prefers to stay in his own home and commute.   The practicality of both the
isolated multi-purpose covered areas, and staff housing, should be considered
carefully before these ara included in future projects.
2.13       Furniture and E4uipment.  Educational equipment and furniture
acquired for the project are unsophisticated,suitable for the level of
training involved, adequate in quantity, sturdy and of a satisfactory quality
of workmanship. All equipment and learning materials were procured from
abroad; about 90% of furniture was locally manufactured. Procurement which
was in accordance with Bank guidelines was appropriately begun only when
civil works had been initiated in order to time deliveries with completion of
schools, and delivered in bulk to DEPE for subsequent distribution to the
dispersed schools. However, unavailability of local transportation tD
project schools, many of whiich (about 45%) were off regular transportation
routes, delayed deliveries from MED to about half of the project schools
until close to the closing date.  DEPE had to count upon the limited
transportation facilities of MED to deliver furniture and equipment, whenever
these were available.  The rural communities were instrumental in getting
this equipment to the isolated satellite schools as delivery vehicles often
could get no further than the NER central school. All furniture and
equipment (except for CIBA-18 in Rama which is under construction) are now in
place. Deliveries of a limited quantity of library books to CIBAs and NER
central schools will be completed by the end of April 1983. In future
projects, appraisal missions should investigate the transportation need for

project implementation, and, where transport difficulties are foreseen,
vehicles for delivery of equipment, furniture and construction materials
should be provided to the extent possible to the project unit, as these
vehicles would und&ubtedly be useful to the institutionL even after completion
of the project.
2.14       Technical Assistance - Specialist Services.  The services rendered
by educational specialists to the project mere substantially in accordance
with the appraisal targets, if the technical assistance related to
agricultural education that was deleted through the Loan Agreenent amendment,
is excluded (Table 2.3).  However, the Government's current assessment of the
technical assistance provided is that the services rendered in the field of
nuclearization was of insufficient depth. The technical assistance program
was rendered in two stages: 12 3/a out of the 100 s/m provided were completed
before the 1979 civil war, and the remaining 88 s/m after the war.
Effectiveness of the first services (12 s/m in curriculum development)
rendered were effectively lost in the aftermath of the civil war. Contacts
established between specialist and local counterparts were interrupted and
substantial documentation was lost. Of the 88 s/m of services rendered after
the civil war, 35 s/a were provided by five local consultants who generally
performed satisfactor,.ly within the limits of the guidance provided by
expatriate specialists which tended to be too theoretical, particularly in
the area of nuclearization. The field application of these concepts, was
therefore not as effective as expected. Additional assistance in this area,
and particularly in atudent evaluation which was not included because it was
at that time considered of lower priority, is required.

2.15      Fellovships.  The fellowships program as irsplemented, was
substantially reduced in scope and duration compared to that envisioned at
appraisal, but was well executed and met the Government's priority needs for
staff development.  The project originally provided 17 staff-years of
fellowships for local staff in (a) primary school adminislration and
supervision, (b) aecondary school administration and teacher-training and
(c) agricultural education. Because of the outbreak of the civil war in .1979
(a) the curriculum expert who was chief technical adviser of the TA program
and re3ponsible for preparing the fellowships plan was unable to complete
this plan; (b) the agricultural education component was deleted during the
first loan amendeient (para 1.02).  Problems in identifying suitable fellows
and appropriate training institutions, and government reluctance to release
key staff for long periods of training abroad prompted the administration to
propose a more limited series of study tours in the same general areas, to
which the Bank acquiesced.  The study tours provided training for 19 staff as
compared to the planned 10 but absorbed only abou-t 12 of the 84 s/m provided
in the revised Loan Agreement; they were satisfactorily conducted and met the
Borrower's priority needs for staff development in the field of
nuclearization. Training was supplemented by the specialists contracted
under the project. However, the Government feels a further need for
training, specially in school administration and supervision. The mission
concurs with the Government's view.
2.16      Teacher Upgrading Programs.  With the consent of the Bank the
teacher/administrator training prograxs were: (a) shortened takiTig
cognizance of the facts that (i) no separate course for NER supervisors was
required besides the course for the NER director since the latter is himself
responsible for school supervision; (ii) the IREMs would not be able to
supervise CIBAs; and (iii) the agricultural component of the project was
deleted during the Loan amendment; and (b) modified to include additional
teacher training programs in industrial arts and home economics. The
changee, together with reduction in length of sDme training courses, rcsulted
in only 913 of the planned 2,014 staff/months being used (Table 2.4).

2.17      Despite the reduced length of training courses in multigrade
teaching, the program was successful and the new techique is being
satisfactorily applied in satellite schools. Training of mathematics
teachers, however, (provided at appraisal) was not implemented and should be
mounted to meet a real dearth of teachers in this discipline. Furthermore,
upgrading courses Lor teachers/administrators should be updated and conducted
regularly, and a continuous evaluation of the education and training programs
should be carried out as provided under the project now that MED has defined
its y>licies more concretely (para 3.04).
2.18      Project Cost and Financing.  The project as modified incurred a
total cost of about US$24-12 million or 21% (US$4.28 m) above appraisal
estimates including contingencies.  Details of project cost, analyzed in
Annex 4 are summarized below:

2.19      Comparison between appraisal and actual cost of project components
which were not subsequently modified indicates an increase of actual over
appraisal costs by about 40%. By including the estimated cost of community
labor inputs into school construction (about 30% of the paid up cost of these
schools), the total increase would be about 43%. By early 1980 when about
95% of civil works still remained to be contracted, base costs are estimated
to have already increased by 50% over appraisal base costs when the price
escalation rates estimated at appraisal are applied. Data gathered from INEC
(the Nicaraguan Bureau of Statistics) however reveal that general
construction price indices for June 1980 were more than 100% above the 1976
levels. Therefore, the cost overrun is attributable mainly to actual price
increases which were much higher than appraisal estimates. Comparison of
capital costs per student place (Table 2.6) between actual, appraisal and
Bank-wide averages for education projects implemented between FY78-FY80
reveals that: (a) for rural primary schools, actual total unit capital costs
are 65% above appraisal costs and 29% above the Bank average (which could be
explained by the difficult sites); and (b) in the case of the basic secondary
schools, actual unit capital costs are 28% above appraisal estimates but 19%
below the Bank average.  Overall, the costs of the project are reasonable
compared to Bank averages, and the minimal maintenance costs required for the
facilities make them economic in the long run.

2.20      The major proportion (82.8%) of total project expenditure was
allocated to civil works (Table 2.7). Considerin8 the implementation delays
and the resultant higher cost escalation (para 2.19) in civil works the
actual allocation is not unreasonably more than the proportion (72.7%) at
.ippraisal. The decrease in actual equipment allocation was due to a
judicious selection of items procured and analysis of quantities required.
As a result of the increase in total project cost, Bank participation in
financing of total cost decreased from 55% at appraisal to about 46%
(Table 2.8).

2.21      Disbursements.  While there were practically no disbursements
during the first 4 years of project implementation, disbursements were
completed rapidly during the last 2.5 years when about 95% of the loan
proceels vwas  processed.  This disbursement performance during the latter
period (see Basic Data sheet) is renarkable for education projects,
particularly in the region, where disbursements have averaged 8 years for
projects approved in the mid-l970s. The rapid disbursement is due in great
part to the Bank's agreement to reimburse 100% of the civil works
expenditures up to an aggregate amount (US$2.0 million) for about one year
after the civil war (up to June 1980) in order to ease the Government's cash
flow constraints. This increased disbursement rate was subsequently reduced
to insure the Bank's meaningful participation in project cost financing up to
the closing date. This facility given to the Government ensured that project
implementation could go on at full speed without the uncertainty about
counterpart funds until local budgetary processes could operate smoothly.
This increased disbursement rate should be considered for other projects,
especially when government budgetary processes or other unforeseen
constraints impede implementation temporarily.
III.   OPERATIONAL OUTCOMES
Overview
3.01      Significant gains have been achieved in developing the country's
education system. Rural primary and secondary education opportunities have
been expanded under a nuclear school system, enrollment targets substantially
reached and teachers adequately trained. However, significant problems
emerged: confusion in the organizational structure of the education system;
lack of improvement in internal efficiency; substantial numbers of
unqualified teachers and a serious lack of educational materials.
Organizational and Administrative Issues.
3.02      Admnistrative Linkages.  The project aimed to assist the
establishment of Rural Education Nuclei (NER) in 18 areas (the
nuclearization decree was passed in March 1976). Each NER would constitute a
technical and administrative educational unit composed of a "base school",
one or more "sub-base schools", and several "associated or satellite
schools". The NER in turn would be linked administratively to a lower
secondary school (CIBA) which falls, under a decentralized secondary school
supervision and administration scheme, within the jurisdiction of existing
regional diversified secondary schools (IREMs).  The organizational scheme
has been established, and 16 NERs built under the project.   However,
prubL4ms have arisen which the Government has just begun to cope with.



- 13 -
Only limited progress has been made in thinking through the administrative
links and the chain of command between the central government and its several
regional subdivisions. Consequently, at each regional level there is
considerable vagueness regarding the powers to be exercised by each. In
keeping therefore, wiith a nationwide preoccupationi with participatory
mechanisms, complex and major decisions regarding the structure of the school
system and of educational planning are left to NER directors and school
principals, as being the people most capable of making judgments on local
matters.  These, however, are the very people most subject to pressure from
the local community to open new, or expand existing schools; from teachers
who seek to fit their teaching programs into other commitments; and from
students who choose the shift they wish to attend in accordance with their
working hours, Meanwhile, the lack of prescribed regulations for the conduct
of schools deprives the NER director or school principal of any support to
resist such pressures. Two consequences fJow from this situation. Firstly,
the structure of the education system has become confused, and parallel
organizational patterns are developing which threaten the cost effectiveness
and quality of education (Annex 5).   Satellite schools (grades 1-4) are
being transformed into and thus paralleling base or sub-base schools, often
without the physical facilities or staffing to provide the upper levels of
primary education, or to exercise the required supervisory functions over
satellite schools. In like fashion, and with similar results, base and
sub-base schools (grades 7-9), are assuming the function of the CIBA, which
in turn are now offering the full five years of secondary education (Grades
7-11), the prescribed role of the IREMs. In some cases these changes could be
readily defended provided the school infrastructure were adequate to meet the
new demands. Since this is almost never the case the second consequence to
flow from the lack of organizational directives is the creation of small
classes and the uneconomical use of facilities and teachers; and the
attribution to schools of teaching programs and/or superviscry functions for
which they are neither adequately constructed and equipped, nor staffed. The
government should take urgent steps to define the functions and
responsibilities of regional, zone and NER key staff, and to elaborate
criteria for the minimal physical and staff requirements for each type of
school, including lower and upper limits for class sizes and the conditions
under which schools may vary their prescribed teaching programs.
Efficiency and Quality Issues
3.03      Use of School Facilities.  Although the use of double-shifts in
project schools is generally being implemented as envisioned at appraisal,
in general, the use factor of schools should be improved. While in the rural
areas in particular, distances sometimes preclude the operation of more than
one shift, there are numerous instances of both under-utilization and
over-utilization. The former results in diseconomies; the latter in inferior
educational quality. This is exemplified in the organization of the 21
CIBAs. Annex 6 shows that out of the 21 CIBAe9, 4 operate no morning shiftand
7 no afternoon shift; conversely 9 function on a 3-shift basis with a
resultant truncation of the daily duration of each shift.  Under-utilization
may be a consequence of mislocation of schools (para 2.11), or of the
unplanned creation of new schools in areas of sparse population as the result
of popular pressures. Over-utilzation may similarly be a result of
miWLocation of scnools and/or stem from the introduction of additional



- 14 -
courses for which the scbool was not designed. Solution of these problems
lies in taking the actions described in para 3.02.
3.04      'Efficien         the System. The government's preoccupation with
increasing enrollments (para. 3.02) has delayed measures to improve internal
efficiency. At appraisal, the project was expected to assist the Governnient
in raising the primary education completion rate from 22% in 1973 to 28% in
1980 (average for rural and urban schools). Statistics available only for
the 1973->78 cohort (Annex 7) show that the average completion rate had
improved to about 24% iin 1978.  Determinants of t;iis  situation included: (a)
the disruption of classes caused by the 1979 civil war; (b) the much later
date than foreseen at appraisal in inaugurating these schools and, as a
result9 the as yet limited impact on student retention; and (c) ongoing
problems of access, teacher quality, out-of-date curricula and lack of
teaching/learning materials to stimulate student performance. Promotion,
repetition and dropout rates (Annex 8) are a continuing cause for concern as
may be gathered from Table 3.1 below.

3-05      The lack of improvement in student flows can also be examined
through a comparison of the uneven distribution of students per grade in 1974
and 1982, as shown in the following Table and Annex 9.

3.06      The reason for this uneven distribution of the intakes lave been
discussed in para 3.03; resolution of the problems depends in part on the
taking of those actions described in para 3.02   Clearly, with the hope for
improvements in retention rates, the present enrollment explosion in the
lower grades poses a serious threat to school cepacity already under strain.
3.07       There are, however, indications that the situation is improving, at
least in the better organized and better staffed schools where the mission
observed repetition and drop out rates of below 5%. This trend should



- 15 -
continue, given the new primary curriculum now baing launched and the
attendant teacher training programs and distribution of educational materials
which have now taken place.  In the CIBAs, too, the installation of workstiope
and science laboratories, and the' training given to practical subjects
teachers, should materially assist student motivation and performance, and,
consequently, promotion and retention rates.
3.08       Little can be said at this stage regarding external productivity
given the recent inauguration of the project schools. However, there are
indicationa that large numbars of secondary students have aspirations toward
higher educatior..
3.09     gEnrolments.  Annex 10 summarized below, presents a comparative
table of planned and actual enrollments and shows that planned enrollments
are close to appraisal estimates, but that student distribution by grades is
skewed.
Table 3.3: Planned and Actual Enrollments
Grades:          1-4      5-6     7-9       10-11     Total      Percentage
Appraisal  ].6 72   5,897   6,548             -       28,817         100%
Actual         16,391   1,503   7,054    1,489    26,437              92%
The 1982 NE3 enrollments are 80% of appraisal estimates (22,270), but the
shortfall i-' partly due to the fact that only 16 nuclei out of the 18
envisioned ;.t appraisal were estAblished (para 1.02).  CIBA enrollments for
1982 in the 18 schools originally contemplated are 5% abov:, appraisal
estimates.  By including the three additionl CIBAs, lower secondary school
enrollments are 30% above appraisal estimates.   Special features of
enrollment patterns in the CIBAs include: (a) the wide disparity between
schools (total enrollment range 72-909) and (b) the uneven distribution of
students per class (range 4-65).
3.10      The expansion of the CIBAs to complete secondary level institutions
merits a comment. Firstly, in the long interval between project appraisal
and school construction, CIBAs intended for grades 7-9 had already developed
into full secondary level schools (grades 7-12). Secondly, the appraisal
plan to associate the lower level CIBAs into a regional secondary school
system based on the i.versified secondary schools (IREM) constructed under
Loan 532-NI was probably misconceived. The considerable geographical
distances between the TREMs and the CIBAs (often in excess of 50 kms.) and
the resultant transport costs involved both for students and IREM
teachers/supervisors, in commuting between home/school, limit the feasibility
of the proposed linkage. At all events, the planned regional secondary
education system, as required by Section 3.02 of the Loan Agreement, has not
transpired. This in itself should not affect the quality of CIBA education.
However, the over-utilization of these schools to permit the introduction of
the diversified cycie(grades 10-12), has resulted in excessive class sizes.
Moreover, the availability of adequately prepared staff to teach the advanced
courses remains a matter of concern, while the purely academic programs
offered in the CIBAs do not afford students opportunities to select technical
programs such as exist in the IREMs into which CIBA graduates had been



- 16 -
axpected to faed.  Finally, the new independent status of the CIBAs requires
that adesquate regional. supervisory services be devaloped.
3.11      Teachers.  While the teacher uparading program was generally well
implemented and met the needs of the project, a sUbstantial number of
unqualified teachers remain to be trained (Table 3.4). Annex 11 presents
details of the qualifications of primar- and secondary school teachers.  It
shows that 52% of rural primary, and 71% of secondary teachers have less than
the minimum qualifications appropriate to their teaching commitments. In
order to secure qualified teachers at primary level, the system is being
underpinned in the rural areas by some 2,000-2,500 trained Cu',n teachers.
At sec_ondary level many teachers are taking part-time courses to improve
their qualifications.  The Goverrunent has initiated in-service teacher
training courses in the new first grade curriculum to be introduced in. 1983,
and has expanded preservice training. The nucleo system has become the
vehicle for monthly teachers workshops (TEPCE) at which in-service training
sessions are given.  Nonetheless, the situation calls for considerable
investment in teacher education (para. 3.14).

3.12      Curricula.   Loan 532-NI supported a significant qualitiative
improvement of secondary education through the introduction of a
well-balanced curriculum, which was already being implemented at the time of
appraisal. Since the advent of the present adrministration, "transition
curricula" are in use while curricul3um revision studies and development of
teaching Enaterials are in progress. Bilateral assistance has been obtained
for the revision of curriculum content and timetable loadings.  The
curriculum revision process, however, needs to be accelerated, for which
additional external financial support and technical assistance Vould be
appropriate. A further curriculum issue stems from the truncation of the
school day in some schools, notably, the CIBAs (para 3.03 and Annex 6) and
from the development of courses in schools inadequately equipped and staffed
for these programs.
3.13      Teaching/Learning Materials  The project did not provide for the
development of teaching and learning materials as the focus was primarily on
increasing education opportunities by the establishment of school
infrastrlucture.  A follow-up project which envisaged the provision of
teaching materials and the strengthening of educational supervision was



- 17 -
appraised by the Bank in 1981. Negotiations were completed for a Bank loan.
Subsequently, the Government withdrew the loan from Board presentation and
insisted on all IDA credit. The importance of this proposed project to the
qualitative improvements of the Nicaraguar. education system makes its early
implementation desirable. Apart from government steps to introduce a revised
curriculum, with teaching guides and student materials for the first grade
(para 3.12), there is an almost universal absence of student texts, a
critical shortage of library books, and a serious lack of support services
(transport, subsistence allowances) to underpin a school supervision
program.  Teachers and supervisors have made heroic efforts to perform their
functions in spite of these limitations, but the Government in the years
ahead should redouble its efforts to meet these critical necds.
Recurrent Costs
3.14      Presently the expansion of education owes much to the services of
2,000 - 2,500 Cuban teachers. Representing about 10% of the total primary
teaching force, their services are provided without cost to the Government.
While their eventual replacement by nationals does not constitute an
insuperable difficulty (teacher training has been expanded to meet this
contingency), the added salary burden of replacing the Cuban staff will
present a real challenge to a country already allocating almost 11% of total
government expenditures to education (Annex 12). These expenditures are
conservatively estimated at C$90m annually or US$9m in 1982/83 at the current
exchange rate and constituting about 11% of 1982 MED actual recurrent
expenditures or about 8.5% of recurrent expenditures programmed for 1983. It
is in this context that the administration must develop strategies to
gradually replace expatriate teachers and eliminate inefficiency from the
education system (e.g., define appropriate class sizes and school sizes).
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Conclusions
4.01      Overall the project can be rated successful, worthwhile, and of
considerable potential benefit to the Government. It has substantially
achieved its objectives, and the Government has complied with most of the
covenants of the Loan Agreement as amended following the 1979 civil war:
(a) Although implementation took 6.5 years or 44% (2 years) longer than
appraisal estimates, this is in line with the average implementation period
for the education projects approved in the mid-1970s. Only about 5% of the
project was implemented in the four years preceeding the civil war, but the
rapidity with which 95% of the project was completed and 95% of the loan
proceeds disbursed in the last 2.5 years in spite of the country's continued
economic difficulties is exceptional in the LAC region and among Bank
education projects in general. The remarkable performance during this period
should be credited to the flexible approach taken by the Bank, the high
priority given to the project by the new government, and the stability of a
competent project unit staff;



- 18 -
(b) In spite of the problems with site selection, contractors and cost
overruns, the appraisal targets for school facilities have been
satisfactorily met by constructing 184 rural primary schools providing 13,680
student places, 21 CIBAs with 5,200 student places and by repairing 19 IREMs
(with 17,500 student places) damaged during the civil war;
(c) the schools provided are of economical unsophisticated quality
making maximum use of local materials, easy to construct, expand and adapt to
varying site conditions due to the standard modular designs developed under
the project;
(d)  the experience gained in community involvement in school
construction and maintenance is a model in cooperative effort, efficiency,
and economy in the use of resources, and one which other countries might well
copy;
(e) in general, school locations and sizes are appropriate although
unforeseen population shifts between appraisal and the start of
implementation resulted in apparent mislocation and undersizing/oversizing of
some schools. These errors were only discovered after the rush into
implementation after the civil war, by which time it was too late to correct
them. The usefulness and appropriateness of staff housing are likewise
doubtful in half of the cases where these were provided.;
(f) furniture and equipment provided to project schools are simple and
adequate for the level of instruction required. there were delays in
deliveries to schools due to transport difficulties;
4.02      The project cost overrun of 21% (tJS$4.3m) can be attributed to the
four year delay in starting implementation of most (95%) of the physical
components.  Tn addition, actual price escalations in civil works were about
twice appraisal estimates due to (i) a much higher inflation rate than
estimated at appraisal; and (ii) scarcity of materials. The resltant unit
capital costs are nevertheless within a reasonable range compared to
Bankwide averages for education projects implemented during FY78-FY80.  As a
result of the cost from 55% at appraisal to about 46%. About 95% of the
disbursement were made during the last 2.5 years of implementation; this
remarkable performance was made possible partly by the increased disbursement
rate applied for one year when project inplementationwas resumed after the
civil war.
4.03      With regard to educational aspects, the principal achievements have
been realized. While it is as yet premature to gauge educational outcomes,
there are however, indications that internal efficiency in project schools
needs to improve.
(a) in the area of technical assistance, the specialists' and
consultants' services targets (96 s/m) have been substantially attained, but
further assistance in nuclearization is necessary. The fellowship's program
was cut back significantly, from 84 s/m to 12 s/m due to the use of study
tours instead of longer periods of training abroad for local staff;
nonetheless, this program as implemented met the most immediate needs of the
Government and the project;



- 19 -
(b) the project aimed to expand rural education opportunities under an
innovative nuclear school system and through a regional secondary education
system. The naclearization system has been put into operation within a new
decentralized regional administrative structure. This structure, however, is
presently operating without precise definition of the liniages between, and
the responsibilities of each regional management level, and decisions are
being taken locally which are distorting the structure of the education
system and militating against cost-effective and sound educational
practices. The planned regional secondary education system has riot
materialized, partly because the logistical problems of the proposed linkage
between CIBAs with the exisitng IREMs were not foreseen at appraisal, and in
part, because of expanding lower secondary schools (CIBAS) between loan
signing and project implementation. The planned CIBAs have developed intc
full five-year secondary schools with resultant pressures on accommodations.
In addition, lack of an adequate support system (i.e., textbooks, curriculum
revision. supervision) is adversely affecting the efficient operation of the
schools;
(c) Appraisal enrollment targets for both NERs and CIBAs have been
reached but promotion, repetition and dropout rates have not improved above
the rates at appraisal and are a continuing cause for concern although trends
suggest improvement in internal efficiency;
(d) About 1,000 teachers for project schools were satisfactorily
trained in the upgrading program under the project.  A substantial number Df
unqualified teachers, however, remain in the system.  The primary teaching
service is presently supported by some 2000-2500 unpaid Cuban teachers. An
expanded teacher training program would allow the eventual replacement of
these foreign teachers but expected salary costs could strain the
government's education budget;
(e) Curriculum revision is still in progress and needs to be
accelerated. Specialists from bilaterial programs are helping in tlis
regard, but additional external support is needed;
(f) There is an almost universal absence of teaching materials (books,
manuals, teachers' guides). Teachers and supervisors have made heroic effort
to perform their functions in spite of these limitations, but as2istance is
much needed from external sources.
Recommendations:
4.04      The Government should take all necessary measures to:
(a) ensure the continued effectiveness Df DEPE by providing staff with
incentives and opportunity for advancement and professional development;
(b) review and update its demographic and educational data as a
preliminary basis for determining the educational needs of each
administrative region and the means whereby to develop a rational, cost
effective, and economically viable school network;



- 20 -
(c)  promulgate the necessary regulations prescribing: (i) the chain of
command between nucleo, zone and regional authorities; (ii) the precise
duties, responsibilities and powers of each of these authorities; (iii) mini-
mum and maximum class sizes; (iv) minimum physical, staffing and geographic
requirements to change the teaching program of schools; and (v) cDnditions
under which such changes may be effected, as special cases not conforming inX
all respects to the requirements listed in (iv) above;
(d) accelerate the curriculum review process, and thereafter seek means
whereby to: (i) inprove the qualifications of its teaching force; and (ii)
prepare, produce and distribute teaching/learning materials as required by
the new curricula, including the provision of adequate stocks of library
books;
(e) ensure that at each regional level school supervisory services are
provided on a regular basis with transportation and subsistence allowances
adequate to their tasks;
(f)  nonitor and rationalize prLmary and secondary enrollments to ensure
that due regard is given to school locations, economy and optimal learning
conditions; and
(g) devote attention to improving internal efficiency in project
schools by taking steps to accelerate the progress in curriculum development;
provide adequate taching and learning materials; upgrade the level of teacher
qualifications; and conduct regular and effective school supervision.
4.05      The Bank should:
(a)  include this project in its "second look" progran so as to
monitor the educational outcomes once the schools are fully operational;
(b)  consider the utility and practicality of staff housing  Tnd
additional structures intended to be annexed to existing school buildings
such as "multi-purpose covered areas";
(c)  in future projects of this nature, assess the transportation needs
for project implementation, and, where transport difficulties are foreseen,
provide to the extent possible vehicles for delivery of equipment, furniture
and construction materials;
(d)  encourage the use of community participation in building rural
schools where such possibilities exist; and
(e)  encourage the naxinum use of local consultants working in close
collaboration with expatriate specialists who may know little of local
conditions and may tend to be too theoretical in their approach.
4.07      Both the Borrover and the Bank should recognize the advisability of
a reappraisal of project assumptions/content before rushing into project
implementation, particularly in -those cases where considerable time has
elapsed between loan signature and the actual start of implementation, in
order tD confirm the continued validity of earlier assumptions.
