i.        Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi AeS, (TSKB) established in 1950 is
the oldest SLd one or the largest development finlnce complnies assjsted
'by the World Bank. IFC became a shareholder of TSKB in 1963 and presently
holds 11.6c% o  the paid-in share capital of LT 65 mi'llion.  As of Decer,mber 31,
1968, TSEB's assets reached LT 1,151 million. Its local currency loarL
resources have been largely provided by the Government and the foreign exchange
resources by the Bank and IDA, EIB and USAID,. The Bank and IDA have made six
loans to TSKB totalling $63 million.
ii.       During the First Five Year Plan which ended in 1967 the average
annual growth of GNP was almost 7%, Value added in industry grew at arn
average rate of about 10% per year and industry's share in GDP increaseld from
about 14% in 1960 to 16% in 1966. The private sector accounted for about
two thirds of total industrial investment. The main problem at the present
time is the isolation of Turkish industry from outside competition with the
result that many non-economic industrial investments are being made.
iii.      The Second Five Year Plan aims at a growth of gross value addled in
industry of about 12% per year and an overall growth target for GNP of 7%.
Investment in the manufacturing sector is projected to increase about 1.0% per
annum and in aggregate will be twice as much in the Second Five Year PLan as
in the first,
iv.       TSKB has made a significant contribution to the Turkish economy in
Droviding, long-term finnnnp to the nrivate maTnniifn(turing sector.  It has
financed 15% of total investment in private manufacturing industry duriLng
thA First; Fi've Year Plan period.  TSi'ts rerent busuiness volume has depended
mainly on the availability cif foreign exchange resources.  The level of

adequate provisions have been established for doubtful loans and investments.
Vi.       TSKB's equity operations have been important and its portfolio
sales have been a major source of shares for the investing public. TSEB
recently started issuing ancd guaranteeing industrial bonds, which is a
positive step toward the deielopment of a capital market in Turkey.

vii.    T-S0 is a profitable institution operated by a competent managsment
in accordance with sound financial principles.   Its activities arne developing
at a reasonable rate and the demand for financing remains strong.
Vili.   TSFB is a suitable and creditworthy borrower.   The proposed loan of
$25 million is somewhat less than that originally requested by TSKB. However,
this is a reasonably sized loan in view of the need to tighten the criteria
relating to the economic viability of projects financed by TSKB, which may
reduce the amount of projects eligible for TSKB assistance.   TSKB is making
a reasonable attempt to define the economic viability of projects it finances
and will be refining its techniques in this area in the future.
ix.     The other terms of the loan should be similar to the general terms
now being applied to Bank loans to development finance companies. The exist-
ing debt luimitation should be maintained, with the modification tllat maturi-
ties of thie subordinated Government loan which are payable before the last
maturity of the Bank loan will be excluded from the borrowing base. It is
recommended that TSKB's free limit be inereased from $200,000 to $75o,000
with the provision that at least 70% of the loan will come to the Bank for
prior approva1.  ThJs degree of ccverage is considered necessary in viewi of
the need to ensure sound economic allocation of the Bank's funds in a
situation where the normal market pricing system is not a complet lyv satis-
factory gu:ide to resource allocation.
x.      TSKB is also expandinig its capital by means of a one for two rights
issue at par.  This is an attractive offer and consequently r'C should
exercise its rights to purchase 7,510 shares at a total cost of LT 3,755,000

APPRAISAL OF
TURKIYE SENTAI KALKIIJMA BANKASI A.S.
I. IANTRODUCTION
1.      Established in 1950 Turkive Sinai Kalcinma Bankasi A.S. (Industrial
Developrient Bank of Turkey or TSKB) is the oldest and one of the largest
development finance companies assisted by the World Bank. It has previouslv
received Bank or IDA funds in 1950, 1953, 1962, 1964 and 1966, totalling $63
million.  IFC became a shareholder of TSKR in 1963 and presently holds 11 63%
of TSKB's share capital of LT 65 million. Until recently IFC had a represent-
ative on TSKBts Board of Directorsa TSRB some months ago fUll-V committed its
foreign exchange resources and the company has approached the Bank for
additional finance.  It is also proposing to make a rights issue T.wThich gives
IFC the right to take up 7,510 new shares at a cost of LT 3,755,000 ($422,OOC).

II. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ENVIROI0ENT
General
2.      Turkey, with a population of 32.7 million (in 1967) and a GNP at
factor cost per capita of about $293 equivalent, completed at the end of 1967
its first Five-Year Plan. The performance during the First Plan was impressiv-.
The average annual growth of (GINP during this period reached about the 7,'
target, and was brought about by generally favorable weather conditions
leading to good crops and a rapid expansion of industry. During this period
population has been expanding at about 2.5% per annum.
3.      Industrial production increased at an average annual rate of about
10% during the First Plan period while agricultural output increased at about
3.5% per annum. The pace of industrial growth accelerated in the course of
the five-year period and reached about 12.5% in 1967. Industry's contributior
to GDP increased from about 17% to 19% during the five years; agriculture's
share fell from 39% to 33%.
Balance of. Pa,ents
h.      Turkey's foreign exchange reserves have stayed in recent years at
extremely low levels, coveringj less than one month's imports.  Moreover,
there are queues of applicantis for foreign exchange who, under foreign
exchange regulations, are entitled to allocations.  Severe import restricticrn3
in the form of tariffs, quotas or, in some cases, a complete ban on imports
have been built up over the years. In addition, advance deposits ranging frcm
100% to 200% of the c.i.f. cost of goods are required from those importing.
In an effort to avoid the bad effects of a black market, the Government
adopted a multiple exchange rate system: tourists and workers remittance fui-ds
are now exchanged at the rate of LT 12 to $1. The black market rate is eve:-
higher, at least LT 13 to LT 15 per dollar.



Industriaiists wishing to import capital equipment or raw
materials which are under quantitative restriction have two possibilities
for obtaining foreign exchange:  (1) The Union of Chambers of Commerce and
Industry, and (2) TSKB (for capital goods only). The Union receives a
semi-annual allocation of foreign exchange for itemized imports plus a
general allocation for capital goods imports from the Government. The
Union allocates these funds f or raw materials and spares to individual
firms on the basis of such criteria as capacity, output and performance.
Its capitaL goods funds are a'Llocated by a system which attempts to rank
investments by economic priority. Up until 1968 TSKB also was given
responsibility for the allocation of a small amount of funds (about
$4 million per annum) for capital equipment imports but now all such
allocations are through the Union of Chambers. The single largest problem
for industrialists in the present environment is obtaining foreign exchange
and in some sectors firms increase capacity faster than is necessary in
order to secure increased foreign exchange allocations for current imports
of components and raw materials, thereby securing an advantage over
competitors with lower capacities.
Industrial Sector and Investment
6.        Although exact data are not available. it is estimated that value
added in industry at present is one-third derived from State Economic
Enternrises (SEE) and two-thi:rds from private industrv. The Government-
owned industrial sector has generally been characterized by inefficiencies.
The overa11 ret.irn on investment of the SPREs i9 low, due in narticular to
heavy losses by the railways, and they have not generated the savings
expected from them hy the Gorernment.  However, these enterprises arP some-
times used as instruments of social policy and are not free to establish.
rates and prices on a cost plus profit basis.  In 1967 the investmennt
program of the SEE in the manufacturing sector totalled LT 1,300 million
w.hile private sector mannufactu+ring investmen.t was TT 2,100 i million.  Private
sector industrial investment averaged LT 1,600 million per annum over the
entire Plan period whlle the EE inrvestm.ent program averaged TT Pon mlllion.
7,        Both sectors are, hawever, hIghly protected.  This protection is
self-reinforcing, given the tiLght foreign exchange position in Turkey.

Although the! almost complete protection against imports often results in
high corporate profits, the economic consequences of investment in non-
competitive enterprises are of serious concern. and this is a major
problem facing Turkey at the present time.
l3.       Foreign investment in the manufacturing sector has not been an
ilmportant element in the industrialization that has taken place during the
'last five years although there have been a number of joint ventures
established, Sinr'e indindstry is protected and based on internal markets,
the value of foreign management and international marketing know-how is
not normall 7 seff icient to induce T'urkish busineSsmen to brinc in f oregrn
partners. Secondly, Turkish authorities have had a negative attitude
too,ward f or--;gn   vI -est,mt  eneral., 'y  redisfficult pJrocedurE.Ö
Ior the interested foreign investor. Finally, the present critical foreign
excha nge posit-ion  J. vlhe coun-trwy and the ` fficulti es encount ered in-m-rofi t
remittances discourage some patential investors. One recent administrative
chAnge centralized all dealings with foreign i,nvestors with4in the State
Planning Organization which also administers Turkey's investment and export
J.ncentive progra,s. However, 'the dLfficult foreign exchange situatIon arnd
the resulting set of restrictions and controls on investment and profit
2eMittuarces mean aiet Turkey remains a difiLcult co-untry for the foreign
investor to do business in.
Credit and Finance
9.        During the past two years the private sector has faced a fairly
tight money situation in spite of a significant expansion of bank deposits.
Interest rates on term deposits are fixed by law (2% to 6.5% depending on
the length of the deposit) as are lending rates (10.5% is the normal
commercial bank short-term rate paid by industrialists).  However, lendirg
rates are effectively increased by other bank charges and expenditure taxes
(20%) so the actual cost of short-term bank loans is from 15% to 18%. The
banks also invest in company shares and in a few cases take leading roles
in establishing new enterprises.  The IT Bankasi, for example, had indus-
trial equity participations totalling about LT 345 million in 1967 and last
year increased its equity investments by LT 18 million.
10.       TSKB lends local currenty at 8% and up to January 1967 it lent
f'oreign exchange at 8.5%. Since that time the foreign exchange rate has
been increased twice and is nowf %. These rates are low relative to
commercial bank charges for funds which have a considerably shorter
maturity. The Industrial Investment and Credit Bank (SYKB) rates are 10.5%
f'or working capital loans and :l0.5% for fixed asset loans financed out of
its own resources, and 8% for fixed asset loans financed out of governmental
funds. The 8% rates result from requirements in the Government loan agree-
ments with TSKB and SYKB. In addition, there have recently been several
issues of 5.-year industrial bonds, guaranteed by banks, at 12%, which have
been very quickly taken up by the general public. All of these rates. *zLth
the exception of interest on bonds held by individuals, are subject to a
2O% expenditure tax naid by thS borrotrer.



- h -
'11.     -Given the attractive spreads available to the banking community
as a result of the fixed deposit rates, there is strong competition for
savings by means of advertising and the establishment of branch banking
facilities.  In principle, it would be sound to free the deposit rate but
it is kept low so that it will not threaten the market for 6% tax-free
Government bonds. Moreover, the banks are not anxious to increase their
interest costs. A committee has been formed to study bank reform and one
of its first efforts is to evaluate the interest rate structure and to
suggest meaPsures to rationalize this aspect of the prinng mechanism in
Turkey.
'12.      Institutional savings (insurance companies and pension funds)
are enot an nimp-nt source of investm-ent capital   +r t   pIrlate sector
'The State Pension Fund and the Workers Insurance Organization generate sub-
sta,tial funds but the bu1lk of these goes into Government bond s or to the
SEE's through the State Investment Bank. The Military Pension Fund

Private per;sion funds and insuLrance companies do not generate significanl;
funds and t;heir investmenLt is largely direted to-ward real estate and
Government bonds.
13.       There has been little development in the capital market in the
lasti two years, with the exception of the industrial bond issues reLerred
to earlier. During the last two years there have been no direct public
offers of company shares to raise capital ana TSK3 s portiolio sales con-
tinue to ma.ke up the bulc of eqLity sales on the Istanbul Stock Exchange.
The D:change now lists -74 induiK;-`-rials of wh:Lch 26 are 'taded to a limitei
extent. Dividend yields on trak'ed shares r-un 8% to 15% on industrial shares
and about 6t'I on commercial bankc shares.  Development of the capital market
will be slow due to (a) .williciress of Turkish family-owned companies to
bring in outsiders, (b) u;-nfam. L.rity with investment practices on the part
of the public, and (c) p:ro@blens rej _ing to protL-ction of minority interests
in a company controlled by a fanily or a small closely associated group.
When good securitIes are available they are usually taken up quickly by
investors.  There have also been legal impediments to public share offers
and publicly-held companies buv some of these impediments would be removed
with the passage of the Capita:l Market Bill which has been in the Parlia-
ment for several years. This Bill would also give some incentives for
companies to broaden their ownership. (See Annex 2 for comments on this
Bill.)  This legislation may finally be passed in 1969 but this in itself
will only be a step, albeit a necessary one, toward the establishment of
an active capital market in Turkey.
Second Five-Year Plan
i4.       The overall target of the Second Five-Year Plan is for an annual
growth rate of 7% per annum. To achieve this the industrial sector is to
grow at 12', per annum.  Its share in GNP at the end of 1972 would then be
about 20%; consequently, manufacturing investment would have to be twice
as great in the Second Plan as in the First Plan (LT 25 billion versus



- 5 -
LT 12.7 billion.), The Government has not epnliitlv stnted what the relative
shares of the private and public sectors will be, but estimates are that;
about 60% of planned manufacturing investment is to be private secr'+.  in-
vestrment. These targets are ambitious and imply that the private sector
wr-rill be-n- givrer. e_asieLr 4cc s   fIlnds v.isa-  the pl scr.i
has had in the recent past.  Whether this will be the case remains to be
seen.     The Gover'-nt did allocat LT 200 millon in its 1968 budget for
private industry to be disbursed through financial intermediaries.
15.       The difficulties in proceeding with rational industrial develop-
rnent decisions remain the highly protected local market anld the distort:ions
this leads to, the overvalue(d lira and the difficulty of establishing com-
petitive plants when tne prices oI' rmany basic inputs 'sucn as steel) are,
high above the world market prices, while prices of other inputs are kept
artificially low by subsidle.S.  These are problems that both the Government
and the de-velopment banks face in trying to allocate scarce financial
resources.
III. THIE C01MPANY
16.       General background information on TSKB's ownership, resources,
organization, and broad policies is given in Annex 1. This company is
familiar to the Bank and this appraisal focuses on developments since the
last appraisal report DB-29a dated June 13, 1966.
Otnership
17.       In March 1967 TSKB increased its paid-in share capital from IT 50
million to LT 65 million by means oi a rights issue of LT 500 par value
shares at a subscription price of 135,01 of par.  The book value of TSKB's
shares at. that time was about 1605J of par.  This increase was essentially
a1l absorbed by TSKI's exi,t-Mng shareholders although subsequent to the!

TSKCB. Details of the share ownership are given in Annex 3. The Turkiye Ig

surance conpanies together hold 35.7% of the shares. The total number of
shareholdrers is about 300.  W.,ith the exception of ThrO and twjo small hold-

sentative, Mbr. John G. Beevor, resigned on June 30, 1968, as IFC felt that
coLntirnueU representation was n.o longer needed. Consequently tuhere remiaiin
one vacancy on the Board, which will be filled at the Shareholders Meeting
on February 24, 1969.  The Cnairman of the Board is viir. Bulent Yazici wno
wias, until Mlarch 1967, General Manager of the Is Bankasi. Since leaving the
Ig Bankasi he has devoted considerably more time to TSKB matters. The board
.is an active one; it meets weekly and must approve all loans and investments.
20.       F4gaement Staff and Procedures.   Mr. Resid Egeli has been the
General Manager of TSKB for the past 14 years. He is assisted by three
Assistant General Managers, Mr. Kayalioglu, Mr. Eroguz and Mr. Ors. An
organization chart indicating the departmental organization and staff is
given in Annex 5. TSKB has a large staff of about 67 professionals and
'1 non-professionals, which is the same size staff it had two years ago.
Generally, ISKB has been able to attract and to hold competent people.  TSKB
has a large engineering department, consisting of 18 university trained
engineers, which enables it to evaluate in depth the technical aspects of
projects requesting finance. Although TSKB is criticized by industrialists
for its time consuming procedures, it is also true that more than any other
institution in Turkey it has introduced sound project thinking into the
Turkish private sector. This contribution has been no less important than
its financial contribution.
21.       Coordination among the three groups working on project appraisals-
(financial analysts, economists and engineers) is reasonably good. However,
it has becotme apparent to management, (and was noted by TSKB's auditors)
that efficiencies in the work flow and the detailed paper work of the
company could be achieved and rSKB is in process of establishing the terms
of reference for international consulting firms to review its work procedures,
particularly its accounting administration, to suggest improvements anid
nossible methanization of some of TSKRI accounting work-
Project Appraisals
22.   -   TSKB's project appraisals are based on detailed analyses of the

is difficult to say how much of this lack of clarity is due to deficiencies
in analvsis and how much simnlv to nrohlms of npresentatisnj organization
and translation.  In some cases the marketing analysis dwells on theoretical
aspnent  of demnnal which nre neot A ro+.c1-ir rpInt.M tn thei nnt.na1  . tlat.inn of
a given project and while this probably does not lead to poor decisions,

in the course of the last vear is that TSKB has begun to attempt to analyze
the  - -    r-1  -l o,             ,, uing     s pc^ techni,qes and the
company is endeavoring to refine these analyses (see paras. 30 and 31).
Follow-Up
23.       TSKB's follow-up activities have also improved considerably since
llth pJrJevoJUs BkILU5 LUULI, A sepajJLdate: 61up concentLaUOes Un fLollUW-UJJ CdnU
arnual reports are written on companies which have received loans exceeding
-which eqiu"y investments have been made. The quality o
the reports is improving although additional procedural improvements could.
be mriade in the followL-up departiment.  In this connection some thought is
being given to revision of some of the forms used by the department, which
have not been modified since they were first put into use.
Resources and Resource Position
21t.      The resources acquired by TSKB since its founding are detaile -in
Annex 1, Page 2.  As of December 31, 1968, the resources outstanding or
available were: (in L   I million - includes $7.5 million EIB loan and KIfW loan
signed in January 1969)
Net worth                                     132
Subordinated Government loan                  368
Other Government loans                        48
EID, loans (less repayments) ($29.7m)         267
IBRD/IDA loans (less repayments) ($44.8m)     403
AID loans (less repayments) ($11.8m)          106
KftI loan ($2.5m)                              22
1,346
2'.       TSKB acquired the following funds subsequent to the 1966 Bank/IDA
funds.      IDans of $10 million at 5-1/2% and $7.5 million at 6-1/2% were
obtained fromn the European Investmen-t Bank (EIB).  The EIB funds are used
for projects wh.4ch require a minimum of $400,000 and EIB staff make field
appraisals of each project. Secondly, TSKB recently signed for a $7.5
million AID loan at 6-1/2% which is tied to U.S. procurement. Thirdly, TSKB
received a Dii 10 million loan from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (TSKB's
first) at 6-1/2%.  All these loans are repaid on the basis of collections
from TSKB's sub-borrowers.  Fourthly, TSKB has signed two loan agreements
with the Government for local currency loans totalling LT 48.5 million at
5-1/2∞5 repayable in 15 years.



26.     - Although TSKB has been profitable enough to attract equity
capital, it remains dependent on loan funds from either the Government or,
international agencies. As far as foreign exchange is concerned. TSKB
depends on public foreign funds; it cannot obtain foreign private credit
on reasonable terms. As far as local funds are concPrnPd- TSKB oonerates
under a system of interest charges which do not allow it to raise money in
the- market directly.  TweO ponsible  ltenhives to modnify this situation
are: (a) tax free status for TSKB bonds so that they could compete with 6%
15tax- .vancn          jolii:-,n    l\b) restuctring.ln  of TSqKB?S in.rn
rates to more closely approximnate what the market will pay, thereby allowing
1'SKB to pay the 1l, or so required if it is to successfullyT place its ow..n.
clebenture issues. The second alternlative would mean a significant recasting
of  n.teres charges and w.,ould Aprobabl-,  he 4-t- b- e -A 4- -d -an -ral pl-

interest rates await its recommendations.
Relations with Government
27.       TSKB has recently had lengthy discussions with the State Planning
Oirganrzation. (SFo) over the SPO:s right to approve projects obtaining
scarce foreign exchange resources from TSKB. Since TSKB is one of two
sources from which private industrialists can obtain foreign exchange for'
capital goods imports (the other being the Union of Chambers of Commerce
and Industry) and foreign exchange is so scarce, SP0 wanted some say in its
allocation. It appears that a satisfactory procedure has been established,
which is as follows:
(a) Industrialists must obtain SP0 approval for their projects
before seeking foreign exchange in excess of $200,000.
SP0 undertakes to evaluate the economic importance of
projects in making its decision. (If the project involves
a foreign investor, SP0 approval is required regardless
of the amount of foreign exchange requested.)
(b)  TSKB is free to accept or reject projects approved by SP0
and may make adjustments in capacity from minus 10% to
plus 20% and may increase foreign exchange loans plus 20%
from the figure;s set by SP0, without SP0 approval.
Changes beyond these points require discussion between
SPO and TSKB.

IV.   POLICIFS AIM OPERATIONS
Policies
28.       There have been several important policy changes made during the
last two years. In October 1966, TSKB modified some of its policies to
take into account the LT 368 million long-term subordinated loan it received
from the Govrernment in February 1966. The new financing limits established
at that time, which were approrPd hv the Bank, are as follows:
(.a) Mn-wimum financial assistance to a sina1 - firm! 1* of
net worth plus the subordinated loan (or about LT 75
(1-a  .Tn l m,  sw  +ir  m wh 4 Y-%f-; n+ -n  i n -   'z nol a  f rmi,  ref
vi J  J  oS-L1A-AP4U  ~j41 9 J- Li  '    ' *--'b//"  -
TSKB's net worth plus the subordinated loan (or about
rT 25 mllion at; present), or 255- of the firm's share
capital, whichever is lower;
(c) Aggregate equity commitments at any one time will not

T'S, -with one exceptlon, is wt hin all these limits.   Its largest com,it-
ment of funds to a single enterprise has been LT 50.5 million; its largest
equity comumitment - the exception - is 'LT 36 miLl'H on, ari'd its aggregaue
equity commitments are LT 135 million.  The large equity investment of
LT 36 million was just made in a new company wnich wil' operate a copper
minre and refinery.  The Etibank holds 4%,- of the total share capital of
LI 180 mill:ion and banks in Turkey were asked by the Government to subscribe
the balance. LT 16 million of TSKB's subscription will be funded by an
interest-free Government loan repayable in a lump sum in 10 years. Annex 6
contains important policy reso:Lutiorns adopted by the Board.
29.      UUntil July 1967 TSKB had no lower size limit on its lending and
a high proportion of its loans were less than LT 500,000 and many were less
than LT 250,000.  In some cases this reflected clients' needs for foreign
exchange to finance essential but low value equipment imports.  WIreover,
mXany clients were coming at frequent intervals for such assistance and
rather than project financing TSKB found itself providing piecemeal foreign
exchange allocations. This was finally recognized as being costly business
and general:ly unsatisfactory and thus TSKB's Board resolved that except in
unusual circumstances no application under LT 250,000 would be entertained
for local currency finance and no application under LT 500,000 equivalent
would be considered for foreign exchange financing.  This change represents
a useful development.
30.       In the last few years TSKB has faced a situation where the demand
for funds, and in particular foreigTn exchange funds, has exceeded its resDurce..
I't also became clear that for reasons mentioned earlier (paras. 7 and 15),
nrofitability was becoming an unreliable basis for measuring a nroject's rea,
wirorth in Turkey.  TSKB realized the imrplications of this situation on its owi
project evaLuation processes and began to put more emnhasis on capanitv,r
utiliation and foreign exchange savings in its analy-3es.



- 10 -
31.        However, foreign exchange savings as a principal criterion is
also not a fully reliable indicator of a project's merit if internal costs
are distorted through shortages, as is the case in Turkey.   Accordingly, in
1967, TSKB's Board resolved that TSKB should give more stress to cost
competitiveness in its analy,ses and decided that project appraisals should
use a shadow exchange rate of LT 12 to US$1, costs should be calculated. net
of taxes and subsidies. the r,ost of capital should be set at 12% and
comparisons should be made with CIF values of similar products.     During
negotiations the general probolem of resource allocation in+ the Tlrkish
environment was discussed with TSKB and refinements in their approach to the
prnolem. were Aa +.hMIIrh r. s                solut-ons are avai1ahle t1 this
problem, TSKB will be continuing to sharpen its analytical skills in dealing

Level of Business
32.        Lending.
TSKB's vo'ume of'business in recent years is shown in Annex 7 and
is summarized below in a table showing net approvals.
1965      1966     1967     1968
Local currency loans

The declirne in foreign currency loan approvals in 1968 reflects the fact that
TS1M had coimiitted all its foreign clrrency resources .and has been going slowT
with additional approvals until it lines up new foreign exchange resources.

of total gross private manufacturing investment during this period.
33.        Charges.   The interest rate on all long-term loans was 8% until
197u Wh itA _W; was increased to 8-1/2o on foreigni eux-Irewy *Unloa. VVWIhen Wthe

additiona.l income from (a) a 1% commitment charge which commences upon
notification of approval (b) commissions on letter of credit businLess which
it undertakes for its clients and (c) a commission on insurance contracts
that it places on borrowers! assets.  Clients pay in addition a 2076
expenditure tax on these rates making the effective rate 9.6% on lira loarns
and 10.8% on foreign exchange loans.   These rates are considerably lower
than market rates for equivalent funds.



- 11 -
34.        Mlaturities.  TS*i3;s loans typically run fromn 5 to 12 yeazs.  in
recent years the average teri of loans has been lengthening.   The weighted
average final maturity of long-term loans committed in 1966 was 6.7 years, in
1967 was 7.3 years, and in 1968 was 7.5 years.  All loans have a minimum
grace per:iod of one year.
35.        Size (Annex 8).  TSKB's lending has been characterized by a 'Large
number of relatively small loans but the average size has increased from less
than LT 1 million previous to 1966 to LT 2 million in 1967 and LT 2.8 in 1968.
Loans of less than LT 1 mill:ion accounted for 64% of the total number in 1966,
52% in 1967 and 37% in 1968 but as compared in amount they accounted for only
16/s in 1966, 9% in 1967 and 13% in 1968. In 1968, TSKB approved only 2 'loans
under LT 250,000 compared to 22 in 1967. In 1967, 9 loans were above LT 10
rmillion (7% in number and 55% in amount) and in 1968, 6 such loans were
approved (6/o in number and 36,fo in amount).
36.        Geographical Distribution.  TSKB's activities are concentrated ir
the industrialized areas in 'Western Turkey.  Industries in the Istanbul ares:
accounted for 60% of TSKBts 'Loans in 1967 and about 70% in 1968. Although
incentives exist for industr:ial investment in the undeveloped regions, very
little capital has gone into the eastern part of the country. TSKB's
distribution ref1ects the genera1 rispiirson of inrdiutrv throue'hout the
country.
37.        Industrial Distributioni (Annex 9).  TSKB's loan portfolio is well
the pattern of private industry in Turkey.    The textile industry has
received 23.7% of all loans   pro-ed Iterl Tn.1 dpecided to reiduc        its
involvement in that sector and for the time being has stopped financing

of 1968. TSKB has not financed projects in tourism and very few in mining.
ionAb s equity commitments are diversified accordinrg to industry and
approximately the same distribution as lending commitments.
Equity Irilestments and Capital Market Activities
38.        As of December 31, 1968, TSIB made 55 equity commitments amounting
to LT 197.9 million of which LT 159.6 million had been paid-in.   From 1965 to
1968, equity commitments and payments were as follows:
1965      1966      1967      1968
Number of commitments           5          12        7         5

- 12 -
Tne decline of equity investnent in 1967 was largely the result of a
Government Decree in that year, which has since been rescirmded at TSKB's
urging, stating that a financial institution could not take both equity and
long-term lending position in the same enterprise.  Other factors which have
tended to limit equity operations are that TSKB will not give repurchase
options to existing owners and it will only take equities that it can in good
conscience sell to a wide-spread public later on, knowing that minority
shareholders will be treated fairly. The large increase in 1968 was due to
the LT 36 million commitment to the copper project mentioned in paragraph 28.
39.        In view of the absence of direct approaches to the public fcr
share subscriptions in Turkey, TSKB's portfolio sales remain the major
source of shares being sold to the public.  Since 1963, TSKB has sold, by the
medium of newspaper advertisements, shares of 22 companies in 36 issues with
a total nominal value of LT 61.9 million at a total aggregate sales price of
LT 78.6 iTtillion-  The capital gains have hpen substantial and the proceeds
from sales have been more than enough to cover new commitments. TSKB'S
marketingn activirty is simnarized below:

purchases.
41.        TSKB has not done any underwriting operations and until recently
had not done any new issue work. However, late in 1967 TSKB began
considering issuing and guaranteeing bond issues for well known Turkish
firms. lo date it has done so for 3 companies raising LT 25 million. All
issues have been readily subscribed by the public and TSKB is appraising
future issues.



- I v -
4~2.       The bondc issued to date have been bearer in form, are revable
in five equlal installments by lottery and have been fully guaranteed by TSKB.
The bonds ,ield 12% less 20% withhol-;ng tx, but because +they are bearer;
no further taxes on the income are probably paid by the recipients so the net
yield is 9 ,, V/0  No formal propspectubs fLor the-se offers LwSWL.Luen  there is
simply a neWspaper advertisement aniouncing the issue.  The bonds, however,
show the S-Mtuiar1Zed accounts of 'he issuing company on the reverse side of
each bond. Purchases are ma(le not so much on the basis of the standing of
the i6Ouingz company but the reputation of the guarantor.
43.        TSKB appraises the projects funded by theae bonds on the saime basis
as if they were lending directly to the company issuing the bonds; noimal
security requirements are also applied. TSKB's charges take three
forms:(a) ai 1% issuing charge on the face value of the issue (b) a 1% charge
on the actual payments of principal and interest to each bondholder (TS'B
makes these payments) and (c) a 1%' annual charge for the total TSKB
guarantee obligation outstan(ding each year. These charges added together
come to a discounted yield of about 2%.
44.        This bond work is a positive development for TSKB because it
gives the company additional security marketing experience. It is also a
step towarods th* creati.on of a more effective capital market.  The issues
to date have been   L>usiastically received which indicates that yields
might be lo,oered somnew'+at bu-t TSIO3 is cautious because it has no idea of the

V.   FAN CIAL CONDITION AND PERFORMANCE
Portfolic Quality
46.        Loans.   TSKB has contiined to experience relatively high arrears,
although in the last eight months a concerted effort has been mounted to
improve the situation.  Loans in default as a percentage of total portfolio
amounted to 82% at the end of 1966, 69% at the end of 1967 and 41% as of
May, 1968.. However, it should be noted that as of May 31, 1968 only 10% of
the loan portfolio was in arrears for more than 6 months. Annex 10
summarizes TSKB's arrear problems and indicates the improvements that. have
been made, in dealing with this matter.



- 14 -
47.        G,ne of the basic problems in this area hai been that court proceed-
ings take such a long time in Turkey that in many cases the threat of going to
court with a deliquent client does not motivate the client to right the
situation. (Another prob'lem has been that TSKB historically was lax with
loverdue debtors and built up a reputation as being easy on overdue accounts).
To get around this, TSIM has commenced securing promissory notes on its Loan
obligations,. TSKB presents the promissory note to the commercial banks for
them to collect. In Turkey, if such a note is not paid, the company is
placed on the default list circulated to the credit community by the Central
Bank and this is a situation borrowers assiduously try to avoid.
48.        'ClTe essential point, however, is that TSKB's loan portfolio is
basically sound.  Of a portfolio totalling LT 740 million at the end of 1L967,
provisions amounting to LT 14 million had been made and it was the auditor's
(Arthur Andersen and Co.) opirion that the provision figure was an over-
estimate of requirements. This opinion is justified. In 1968 further
provisions of LT 3.8 million Were established.   Actual write-offs of loan2s
in 1966 and 1967 totalled onlv LT 66q000 and there were no write-offs
during 19683.
49.        Equity.  As of September 30, 1968, TSKB held shares of 36 companies
acquired a-t a cost of LT 90.3 million.  Detaals of these investments are given
in Annex 11. Twelve of these companies,representing in value 36% of the
portfolion, are paying divder.nds. Seven companies representing in value 222% of
the portfo'lio are not yet in full operation. Eleven companies representing in
valll 27%' 7f the portfolio are- not paying 4-4den.ds although fivPe of them are
reporting small profits; two others are reporting losses but it is expected
that they will be profitable in two or three years.   All companies (except
those for which provisions have been made) indicate in their financial
statem,.ents 'book values exceediLng t1he par -value of their shares;  TSIL estimates
the value of its portfolio at about LT 112 million, which is reasonable
'derLn. iieearninug puwe      comanes                1'
considering the         ----er OI the companies concerned.  TSQDDs average
yearly realized yield on its equity portfolio (dividends plus capital gains
less actual losses) has been *14%. At the end of 1968, TSIM's equity intvestents
reached LT 96.6 million.
50.        At the time of the conversion of the Government funds previously
admi-istered by TSl- into a long-term loan, a portfolio evaluation was r,,ade
and in 1966 provisions of LT 11.8 million were established for 4 equity
irfvestments. In addition, provisions of LT 8.14 million were established in
1967 for 3 other investments.  Also in 1967 one loss (LT 7.4 million) on a
sale was-realized which was written off against the provision establishe!d
previously for the particular investment so that the balance of thle equity
provisions at the end of 1967 was LT 12.4 million (after a recovery of 0..4
million). The provisions appear to be more than adequate; TSKB's auditor
concludes in his 1967 report that the provision for losses relating to equity
investments was excessive by LT 4,500,000. Additional provisions of LT 1.4
million were made for 3 companies against the earnings of 1968.
51.        TSKB is heavily involved in most of the companies in which it has
equity (only three did not have loans).   It has loans outstanding to these
companies totalling LT 245 million or 26% of its total loan portfolio. Although
TSIB's policy calls for a limit to its holding of 25% of the shares of any
company, it still holds more than this in 3 companies (compared to 6 companies
in 1967). TSIB is represente!d on the boards of 31 of the 36 companies in which
it holds shares.

reflects the LT 368.1 million (Government loan acquired in 1966 plus additional
foreign exchange borrOwiungs.  At Lecember 31, 1968, total borro'wins nd
committed debt amounted to 8.1 times net worth.  The borrowing limit ratio
caLculated in accordarme with the definition in the last  ank Loanl Agreer-et
was 1.4:1 as against the 4:1 maximum specified in the Agreement.
53.        Liquid funds were onily about 5% of total assets at the end of 1968.
They are mainly kept on deposilts at yields of 4% to 6%. This is almost as good
as yields on Government bonds (6% tax free), which are not very liquid. About
58% of disbursed loans outstanding at the end of 1968 were in foreign exchange.
Retained earnings amounted to 6.14% of the entire portfolio at the end of 1968;
Provisions amounted to 2.8% of portfolio; combined they totalled 9.2% of port-
f'olio.  TSKIB by law is required to keep certain of its reserves invested in
Government bonds.
Earnings Performance
514.       TSKB's earnings performance has been good historically and has
further improved in the past t-wo vears bv increasing spreads and leverage.
I)etailed profit and loss statemnents are given in Annex 13. The improvement in
spreads is largely due to the change from a 3% management fee on the LT 2.68
million Government funds to a 4LWj spread at present.  In 1967 TSKB's net profits
after tax and a sizeabhl  n1lorntion for possible losses was ecuivalent tc 20%
on average net worth (32%O before provisions).  Earnings in 1968 have run ahead
of last vear's nperf'rmanre.  Net profits reached 22% of average net worth.

respectively on these two bases or net earnings yields on the current share
price of 17.,4%o and 20.8%7 respectively.  The present snare price is not iuflated
relative to the earning power of the shares.
57.        TSKB has paid a 12% dividend since 1954.  In 1965 and 1966 this
amounted tco about a 50% distribution of net profits while in 1967 and 19608 it
was about one-third of net profits (after provisions).  The present dividlend
yield on TU,t's shares at a market price of 240 is 5%.  Overall, given its high
earnings cEapacity TSKB has had no trouble raising its share capital from time
to time. While the dividend yield on the market price has been low, cash
yields to sh1areholders have been improved by (a) a bonus issue in 1963 and (b)
rights issues at prices below book value and market prices in 1953, 1963 and
1967.



VI.   FUTIRE OPERATIONS
Demand Forecasts
58.      T:SKB has taken as a starting point in projecting its potential
lending voLume over the Second Five Year Plan the manufacturing investmrent
targets in the Plan (which projects about a 12% per annum increase in
manufacturing investment).   TSKB has assumed that its contribution in
disbursements relative to the total could be 15% of private industrial
investment, as it has been in the past, and that two-thirds of its loans will
be in foreign exchange. As a starting point these estimates are not
unreasonable.
59.       Fnis analysis defines TSKB's potential market.   In reality, since
TSKF had to restrict -its pcac in OA8R All to a lack of foreign exchange. it
does not expect its foreign exchange disbursements to reach the potential
demand levels in 196-9 and 1970 but it does ex-pect to approach thase levels
in subsequent years.   With respect to local currency, TSKB expects that it
will fir.ance so.n.ewat less than +1-. s   esi     bd  ue    r I-fl&St e
derived from the above demand estimates due to (a)    a rapid growth of bank
deposits and improved liquidity in the bank-ing syst-m and (b)   restraints on
TSKB's ability to raise locaL currency resources. The following table sets

Foreign 4change Fundir
60.        As of the ond of 1968, TSKB had, on an approval basis, allocated
all of its available local and foreign resources including the $7.5 million
loan from EIB and the DX 10 million loan from KfW, which were finalizec in
January 1969, Rn a commitment basis, TSKB had about $15 million available
In foreign echange for 1969 and 1970. TSKB is attempting, therefore, to
find $70 mllion to cover its forecast 1969 and 1970 operations and hoped to
secure about half of this through the Bank with the expectation that it
could raise the other half throueh the combinpd sources of EIBh. itM and AID.
However, with the more rigorous screening of projects with respect to their
econnmTi  viability that TRKR will now               +.n'+tlej  n  the faGt. that the

62.    Capital Increase.  In view of TSKB's expanding volume of business, its
desire for a larger papital base to support that business (including ecquity
operatiorcs) and the strong earnings position of the Company, TSKB's BoeLrd,
in December, agreed to a capital increase consisting of a 1 for 2 right's
offer at par (LT 500 per share) and a 1 for 5 bonus issue.  This increase
is to be aLpproved at a shareholders meeting on February 24 and will havre the
following results,

Since the market price of TS1B!s shares has been near 240% of par for a
nwiber of years, and pince tihe book value of the shares at the end of 19608
was 200% of par and the book value after the rights and bonus issues will be
about I5C(J7 of par, tne rightns issue, at par, is an attractive offering and
IFC plans to exercise itsa rights.

63.       IFC's present holding amounts to 15,020 shares.  Conseqaently ;.t wil'i
receive 3,OOJ bonus shares andi will have the right to subscribe for 7,510
shares at LT 500 per share or a total cost of LT 3,755,000 ($h17,222).  Its
total holding after the increase will be 25,534 shares of an aggregate par
value of LT 12,767,000 or about 11.6% of TSKB's total share capital. The
earnings yield on the shares (at par) after the capital increase will be o- z
3oc.
Projected Financial Position
64.       CTO the basis of the business levels estimated above, TSKB's assets
would increase from about LT 1150 at the end of 1968 to LT 1500 at the end of
1970.  TSEè's debt limit has been 4 times the sum of its net worth and the
subordinated Government loan; this will now be modified to exclude the
maturities of the Government loan due prior to the last maturity of the Bark
loan (to conform to present Bank practice on this matter) and on this basis
the debt limit ratio will reach about 3.2:1 at the end of 1972, at which time
the Bank loan will be fully disbursed. TSKB's cash generation from prof'its crdn1
collections will cover its debt service obligations about 2.0 times during the
forecast period. The equity build-up by means of the capital increase and
retained earnings would allow assets to expand as forecast with little change
in the overall debt equity ratio, which increases from 5.7:1 at the end of
1969 to 6.6:1 at the end of 1970. (Proiected balance sheets - Annex 15).

66.       TSKB continues to play an important role in Turkey as a provider of
long-term finance for the private industrial sector.  It has the capability 'Lo:
executing sound project analyses and it has had a significant impact on
influencing the industrial community to undertake full project studies. The
company's portfolio is sound and adequate provisions have been established fo-'
doubtful accounts.  Although it has had arrearage problems with many of  .
clients in the past, it is making a serious attempt to improve the perforrlr_ e

67.        TSKB has not played a significant catalytic role in joining
foreign enterprise with Turkish enterprise, although it has contributed
finance to about 25 joint ventures. However, there are serious environmental
problems aith respect to foreign investment which are outside TSIB's control.
While the company remains predominantly a lender it has been fairly act;ive in.
equities :ad in revolving its portfolio.   Its venture into issuing and
guaranteeing boards is an encouraging step in the direction of more investment
banking-like functions and this evolution should be encouraged.
68.        TSKB remains a suitable and creditworthy borrower for Bank funds,
it needs additional foreign exchange resources and it has the competence to
make soundc investmrent decisions.  However. the envirormnent in which it
operates requires that extra. care be taken in deciding which projects to
finnnce i    n rfder that the ir ,uz+. iJliz 7.o? WrXnhich TSKR a -sists  ban become

additionra resources somewha,t earlier than originally planned.
70.        TSIB's debt limit (4:l), now modified to exclude from the borrowing
base the maturities of the Government subordinated loans which are payabDle
before the last maturity of the Bank loan, provides the company with adiequate
borrowing capacity for the foreseeable future, and remains a suitable 'Limit.

evaluation and follow up of projects and the increase in the size of i-ts
loans using Bank funds, an increase in the company's free limit-is war.ranted.
TSKB's free limit should be increased from the present level of $200,000 to
$750,000. On the basis of recent business the Bank could expect to receaive
for approval loans totalling; in aggregate 80% of the total loan for pr:ior
approval. Because of the economic issues involved it is appropriate t'hat
the Bank should review a sizeable proportion of the projects which are to
use Bank funds.  The new free lirit should allow this but to insure the
coverage desired, an aggregate limit on projects not requiring Bank ap:Proval
will be set at 30% of the total loan.

Basic Information
Formation ancl OwnershiD
1.        Tiukiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A.S. (TSKB) was established in June
1950 and started operations in March 1951. TSKB's initial share capital of
LT 12.5 million divided into 12';,000 bearer shares of LT 100 each, was sub.-
scribed bv TB institution . mos1t;v nommPrnial banks. In addition to the
ordinary shares, 100 registered founders' shares were issued at no cost to
thp founders in prpnortion t.o their rparticipation  in the initial capital.
entitling the holders to a special bonus out of TSKB's profits.  In October
1953, as a    requirement for the Second Bank Lo n, the authorized share cnpital
was doubled *to LT 25 million by issuing 50,000 shares of par value LT 500
each at a premiulmn of 5%.  In 196l3 the capital was again doubled to LT 50
million by a bonus issue of LT 12.5 million and a share issue of LT 12.5
millin at a 10% pemium.    At +tat time fvC subscribed to TT 7.5 million (par

Objectives and Scone
2.        TSKB's objectives are to assist in the creation, expansion and
modernization of private industrial enterprises, to encourage local and
f'oreign private capital participation in its financing, and to assist in the
develonment of a Turkish capital market.  In addition to operations with its
own and borrowed capital, TSKB formerly administered three revolving funds on
behalf of tha Governments of Turkey and the United States: (a) Marshall P'lan
E'rivate Enterprise Fund for long-term loans to private industry; (b) Capital
Participation Fund for investment in equities; and (c) Industrial Exports
Working Capital Fund for short-term loans for financing the export of indus-
trial goods. The first two funds mentioned above, totalling LT 368 million
were converted into a 35-year subordinated loan to TSKB in February 1966. The
third fund, which amounted to LT 35.7 million was terminated in 1967 and is
being turned. over to another institution.

(listed in A-nnexh) who are elected for 3-year tgerms.  The rhairTman continues
to be Mr. Bulent Yazici who was the General Manager of the I, Bankasi until
Anril 1967- Mr. Beevor, who w      -as orig4+llr elrc+sd in M-'reh 196) as T_Gl_

is also a member of the Board.. TSKBts departments are divided into three
groups, each directed by an Assistant ueneral Malnager. The first group,
under Mr. Kayalioglu, consists of the Loan and Investment and Financial Analy-
sis Department, the End-Use Department, the Secretary's and Aoministration
Department and the two Regional Offices in Adana and Izmir.    The second group,
under Mr. Ors, consists of the Economics Department and the Engineering De-
partment. The third group, under Mr. Eroguz, consists of the Accounting and
Control Department, the Resources and Securities Department and the Disburse-
ment Department. The organization chart is given in Annex 5. Tic total, tai'f
nunbers 158.
6.        Iroject Appraisal Frocedures. All loan applications are received
by the Loan Department. The loan application is sent to a financial ana-
lyst who will see if the application form has been correctly completed and
if all the required annexes are attached. It is only when the information
is considered to be sufficient that the application is registered.    Then,
in an infc'rmal meeting, the three directors of the appraisal departments
(Loan Department, Engineering Department and Economic Department) review the
loan application and decide whether or not an appraisal has to be undertaken
and indicate which points are to be studied more carefully. The applicaLtion
is then sent to the Engineering Department which will make the technical
appraisal of the project. In, the meantime, the End-Use Department will col-
lect all information on the borrowers' credit standing and their ability to
undertake the operation envisaged. After the completion of the technical
report the Economic Departmen,t prepares the economic analysis of the project.
Finally, on the basis of the technical and economic reports, the financial
analyst prepares the full appraisal report to be submitted to the Loan
Committee consisting of the Assistant General Managers and department heads
and later to the Board. Althoueh there is no formal working party there is
liaison among the financial analyst, the en-ineer and the economist at every
stage of the annraisal.  The financial analysts are responsible for general
relations iith the borrowers but on technical details engineers talk directly
with the hnrrnwerq_ The time requlired for an appraisal vnries hut eaGh fii-nt-
cial analyst handles around 20 projects a year.

of the borrow,ers-  All the economi c s+udies hatvre to be undertaken by the+

Economic Department. The main problem is to obtain reliable market sta-
tistics.  Oenerally, it is possible to have broad data on industrial sectors
but this is rarely detailed enough for specific products. The other diffi-
culty is tc, make forecasts because the import figures do not follow a na!tural
trend; they depend upon the availability of foreign exchange and riot on the
law of supply and demand.
8.        Disbursement.  There is a special department in charge of disburse-
ment, operoing letters of credit, and following up on insurance and coll+teral
questions.
9.        Follow-Up. Follow-Up of loans and investments is undertaken by
the End-Use Investigation and Information Department. This Department re-
ceives froml the borrower (a) quarterly reports during the construction period;
(b) quarterly reports from companies in which TSIB has participated; and (c)
semi-annul-lt reports from other borrowers.
10.       Thle End-Use Department prepares end-use reports for all companies
in which the amouint of loans outstanc-ling exceeds LT 500,000 and all companies
in which TSKB has a participation.  In addition, the End-Use Department pre-
pares repo-.rts on O 11 fomnanieS in difficult-1  (ir'nplementation too slow, over-
run, arrears, etc.).  Companies for which a report is prepared are normally
visited at least once each year. Elrerv financial a nalyst is in charge of 30
to 40 companies. In 1968, about 250 end-use reports were prepared.
11.       End-Use reports are sent to the Bank for all loans of more than
LT 5 .mnllJion and equitY investments of more t.h-r LT 1 million.  TSKB sends
end-use reports to EIB or AD) for only the investments which have used their

Minister's Offlce to administer the provisions of the Bill.   Its
menlibers woLuld ke appointed by WLthe InowncL I of Miiser  andLA.UUC IJIU V'd
include representatives of the Ministries of Finance, Commerce
andu 'us-tice, the Central Bank and the union fI thL e uCihambers Of
Commerce and Industry. The Commission would have a secretariat
whose expenses would be met by the Central 3ank and the union of
Chambers. The Commission would be given broad powers to regulate
the capital market.
(b) Provisions are made for the establishment of "Joint Stock
ComDanies Open to the Public" (JSCOP). Such companies must have
at least 50 shareholders, file a prospectus to the Commission
giving detiailed information on the company (for a new concern) or
submit to the Commission financial data and the schedule for ope,.-
ing up their own3rship to the public (for existing firms). For
new companies the founders must by some means underwrite the
public offers of stock. All JSCOP's must be listed on the Stock
Exchange, and must be audited by auditors chosen from a list
specified by the Commission. Auditors must be changed every year.
Finally, JSCOP's annual audited financial statements must be made
public in the Gnzette and in two newspapers.
(c) Underwriters whc take up shares m.ust sell them to the public as
soon as possible and report on their sales efforts to the
Commission.
(Id) The Bill allows the creation of variable capital investment
cormpanies. Their minimum capital must be LT 10 million, they
cannot put more than 5% of their funds into a single enterprise
and they cannot hold more than 12% of the shares of any company.,
No further regulations on oiuch rnrnnnics are Snecified.
(e) The possibility of issuing convertible bonds is openied for
JSCOP's.
(f) The first LT 200 dividend or bond interest income is exempted
from incnome tn- in the hands of the recipients.

Uthe operati.Lon o1 the capital market wnich are not Cuvvered by  etailed pro-
visions in the Draft Bill. Another critical problem is auditing and dis-
closure (which the Bill recognizes) but in the absence of a sound accow-tiing
professioni in Turkey it will be a difficult task to upgrade the system to
the level envisaged in the Bill. Some of the inparent nitfalls in the
proposed legislation have bee,n noted in Turkey and some modifications may
oe made be2ore final action by the Parliament.   The Dill does, homever,
represent   rnecessary step in the right direction, particularly if modi-?ica-
tions suggested by experience are not difficult to implement.

nucleus must be souglht abroad.. It will make investments only after full
examination of applications by this staff.
4.         In selecting enterprises to be financed, the Bank will observe the
following criteria:

b. Soundness of the enterprise;
c. Quick realization and profitableness of the enterprise; and
d.  Desirability of geographical distribution of investment.

TURKIYE SINAI KALKINMA BANKASI A.Q.
Arrears
TSKB continues to face significant arrears although an increased
effort is now being made to reduce delinquent accounts.   Loans in default
as a percentage of total portfolio amounted to 82% at the end of 1966, 69%
at the end of 1967 and 41% as of May 1968.  TSKB has not considered arrears
under three months as serious since most are paid as soon as TSKB presses
for collection. (More than 50% of 0-3 month arrears at the end of May were
paid in the following month). The attempts by clients to delay repayments
reflect the tight money situation in Turkey and the fact that TSKB funds are
less costly than funds from other creditors.
Until recently, TSKB used to take receivables from clients which
were overdue but this nractice was discontinu,d in May because it did riot
really force clients to repay on time. TSKB is now taking promissory notes
from its e-lients.  If these are not honored when due they are 1itnomntier-lly
"protested" (no court action is required) in which case the delinquent
borrower's nar  S published in a "bad risk" circlar issed by the Gentiral
Bank.
Internal procedures on arrears have also been tightened. A rIonthly

and every six months a detailed report is prepared for TSKB's Board by the End.-
UJse Dnart+ment. These epcui*ts gi-ve details on the proble.ms being encovunter-
ed in each case and recommiended action.  Board appproval is necessary to
reschedule any loan.
Uruortunaze1y-, ±eg,a± proceedings are extremely tLrie const-ming.
Only one third of the loans sent to court in 1966 had been dealt with as of
May 31, 1960.  However, during the three years 1965, 1966 and 1967 TSK3 only
had to write off LT 5.4 million in bad debts, most of which had previously
been provided for.  Finally it is Ti;D's judgment, supported by its auditors
(Arthur Andersen and Co.) that provisions made for losses actually exceed the
like!- losses in TSKis nortfolio.
Tables summarizing the arrears position are given overleaf.
