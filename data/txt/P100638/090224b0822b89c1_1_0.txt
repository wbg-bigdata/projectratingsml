                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of this Project is to facilitate market-based farm restructuring through enhancing the ability of farmers, farm family members, and farm workers to manage
                         their assets and income. Under this overarching objective, the Project will assist the Government of Romania (GOR) in (i) completing the property title registration of
                         land assets in rural areas and (ii) improving the delivery of socio-economic guidance services to the agricultural population.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project, implemented by the National Agency of Cadastre and Property Registration (ANCPI), in charge of the systematic registration of properties in rural areas, and the Ministry
                         of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), in charge of providing of socio-economic guidance services to the rural population was restructured in June 2013 and extended only
                         for the components implemented by MARD (as per the Romanian Government's request). At the time, the project had achieved a number of results towards reaching its development

                         Under the systematic registration component, the lessons learned during project implementation led to several amendments in 2010 and 2012 to the legislation governing the
                         cadastre and property registration (Law 7 of 1996) and supporting regulations. These amendments removed most legal and administrative hurdles from systematic registration

                         helping to speed up systematic registration contractors’ work in the field and demonstrating a strong commitment to the project objectives.

                         The systematic registration campaign by the project started in 50 communes (UATs) to ultimately benefit about 230,000 people (of which, about 16,000 Roma) that will resolve issues
                         for about 620,000 property rights. Although stalled in March 2013 because of insufficient budget, the implementation of the systematic registration contracts has now resumed and the
                         activities have been completed in six communes, while it is in advanced stages in 18 more communes. It is expected that all contracts would be completed by December 2014,
                         provided that adequate Government financing continues to be provided.

                         The project also helped institutional development at ANCPI which led to a significant increase of land transactions in the project area while the registration fees have been reduced,
                         as well as the average time to produce certified land book copies. At the same time, the procedures for systematic registration developed under the project facilitated more
                         transparent interaction with land owners so that a large majority participated in consultations with the contractors and ANCPI staff. To protect the rights of vulnerable people, a social
                         monitoring mapping concept was developed under the project and is being implemented, despite the ceasing of loan financing in June 2013, including the participation of vulnerable
                         groups in systematic registration and regularization of property rights for Roma settlements. Eventually, it resulted in legal provisions for recording possession, lease or ownership
                         rights and about 16 000 Roma people are expected to benefit when the systematic registration in all 50 communes is completed.

                         The socio-economic guidance services (SEG) provided to the rural population in 45 communes (of which 31 overlapping with the 50 communes where the systematic registration
                         activities have been implemented) contributed to the increase of the percentage of agricultural land registered in the National Farm Registry to 72% of the project area. These SEG
                         services reached about 65% of the population in the project area, and 55% of the total population accessed the support programs. For these people, over 6,700 individual guidance
                         plans have been developed. The consultants providing SEGP services also benefited from training (based on a Handbook developed under the project) and 800 man-days of training
                         have been provided. Given the positive reception by the rural population of these services and good results on the ground, these services will continue until June 30, 2014 to increase
                         the reaching-out to more beneficiaries.
