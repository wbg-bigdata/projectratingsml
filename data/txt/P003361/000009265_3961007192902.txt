MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Myanmar
Wood Industries II Project (Credit 1444-BA)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Myanmar - Wood Industries II Project (Credit
1444-BA) prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office. The Borrower has not commented.
The PCR emphasizes difficulties in project implementation including slow or non-availability
of infrastructure and electricity; and lack of autonomy for the Project Unit. The project was
cofinanced by the Finnish International Development Agency.
The project was a follow on project to Wood Industries I (Credit 1114-BA). Both projects
were designed to rehabilitate and modernize the wood processing industry in Myanmar. Wood
Industry II aimed to rehabilitate two Teak Sawmills (each with 45,000 hoppus ton capacity per year),
to construct a New Plywood Mill with capacity for 4,000 m3 of plywood and 1,000 m3 of veneer per
year, and construct two mobile hardwood sawmills. These investments would have a higher yield of
more valuable products without requiring higher annual cuts; in part because old and inefficient mills
were expected to be closed as part of the project.
The project outcome is rated as unsatisfactory, its institutional development impact as modest,
and sustainability of results achieved is unlikely. Major contributions to this disappointing result were
a reluctance to close the old mills, and low log allocations to the new mills.
The PCR is of satisfactory quality. An audit is being undertaken.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
UNION OF MYANMAR
WOOD INDUSTRIES II PROJECT
CREDIT 1444-BA
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Wood Industries II
Project in Myanmar, for which Credit No. 1444-BA in the amount of SDR
23.7 million was approved June 12, 1984. The project was co-financed by a grant
of US$6.0 million from the Government of Finland. The Credit Closing date was
extended from March 31, 1990 to March 31, 1993. The last disbursement was made
April 21, 1993 and the undisbursed credit balance of SDR 194,987.30 was cancelled
November 30, 1993.
The Preface, Evaluation Summary, and Parts I and III of the PCR are based
on a report of a project review mission to Myanmar and review of IDA records. It
was reviewed and updated by staff of the Agriculture and Natural Resources
Operations Division, Country Department I, East Asia and Pacific Regional Office
(EAlAN) . The Borrower has not commented on these sections in a separate Part II,
and no comments have been received from the co-financier.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
UNION OF MYANMAR
WOOD INDUSTRIES II PROJECT
CREDIT 1444-BA
Evaluation Summary
Obiectives
1.         The Wood Industries II Project was conceived as the second in a
series of projects that the Government of Myanmar (GOM) wished to undertake to
improve the efficiency of the wood processing industry so as to increase local
value added to its teak resources. The main objectives of the project were to (i)
improve efficiency and product quality of the export-oriented teak processing
industries through modernization and rehabilitation of existing capacity; (ii)
improve the supply of hardwood, sawn timber and panel products to the domestic
market; (iii) introduce production of block board production; and (iv) advance
further the technical and export marketing skills of teak processing industry
personnel, through training and technical assistance. The major components were:
(a)    Rehabilitation of Teak Sawmill No. 4 at Ahlone to saw about
45,000 Hoppus (H) tons per annum of teak logs using modern band
saw technology;
(b)    Reconstruction  of Teak  Sawmill No.  14  at Dallah  to  saw
45,000 H tons  of  teak  logs  also  using  modern  band  saw
technology;
(c)    Construction of a new panel products mill at Monya to produce
4,000 m3 plywood and 1,000 m3 teak veneer annually, and to
introduce block board on a pilot scale;
(d)    Construction of two mobile sawmills with annual throughput
capacity of 10,000 H tons to be located in the North Pegu area;
(e)    Strengthening and modernizing technical skills of wood industry
personnel;
(f)    Strengthening of administrative and construction facilities;
and
(g)    Incremental working capital.



iv
Project Design and Organization
2.        The  design  of  the  project  was  modeled  after  the  earlier  Wood
Industries I Project (Cr. 1114-BA) . Project implementation was to be undertaken
by a semi-autonomous project unit (PU) within the Timber Corporation (TC) in the
Ministry of Agriculture and Forests (MAF).
Project Implementation
3.        Total project cost estimated at US$57.4 million was jointly supported
by an IDA credit of SDR 23.7 million (equivalent to US$25.0 million at the time
of Board approval) and a Finnish International Development Agency (FINNIDA) grant
of US$6.00 million.
4.        Actual project cost  (US$ 65.78 million) was about 15%T higher than
appraisal estimate. IDA disbursements, SDR (23.5 million) totaled US$30.9 million
due to the depreciation of the US dollar vs SDR.
5.        The  choice  of  a  semi-autonomous  project  unit  (PU)  within  TC,
subsequently renamed Myanma Timber Enterprise (MTE) was based on the past
successful practice in IDA-assisted projects that were largely for log
extraction.   As it turned out the degree of autonomy of PU might have been
successful for a forestry project; but with the wood industries project, IDA
entered into a different category of project which required more independent
management. Although efficient in its management, PU had no control over log
supply, foreign exchange for import of auxiliary inputs (particularly glue for
plywood processing),  or project staffing.   This adversely affected not only
project implementation but project results.
6.        Delays at project start due to shortage of cement,  and delays in
providing electric power and staffing caused delays of up to two years in
completion of sawmill sites and over four years at the plymill site. The
continued shortage of electricity and good quality logs have greatly constrained
production. The proposed new sawmill at Dallah had to be dropped due to
unavailability of electric power and quality logs.
7.        Block board production started only in 1992 as the equipment and
required machinery were not delivered on time.
8.        Sliced veneer production is not significant despite the installation
of two horizontal veneer slicing machines because of the lack of demand for
veneer produced in Myanmar, which does not meet international standards.
9.        Financial results and foreign exchange earnings from Plywood Mill No.
5 are favorable because of the signing of a lucrative export contract with a
foreign firm which provides technical assistance and glue, which is unavailable
locally.
10.       The original concept of installation of two mobile units near to
clearfelling sites was dropped after the decision was taken to construct Hardwood
Sawmill No. 4 at Pyu. The mill is well designed and the quality of output is
good but production is constrained by the poor quality of logs, shortage of
electric power, erratic power supplies and unpredictable voltage drops.



v
Project Results
11.       Project results are generally disappointing. Measured by a three year
average input/output ratio of Sawmill No. 4, wood recovery increased from 31% to
36% of true recovery (para 6.1). However, the overall recovery at all MTE's teak
sawmills fell from 42.8 hoppus points (33.6% true) to less than 40 hoppus points
(31.4% true) because of decreasing quality and diameter of logs delivered to the
old mills; and because project sawmills have been working on only a one-shift
basis instead of two, as covenanted in the Credit Agreement.
12.       The expected increase of export of teak processed products - teak
sawnwood, plywood and teak veneer - has not been achieved mainly due to the
decreasing quality of logs arriving at the mills. In FY 1991-92 the country's
export of non-teak-faced sawnwood also dropped to zero but increased
significantly after signing of an export contract with a buyer for the mill's
total production and providing for the supply of glue and other imported inputs
by the buyer.
13.       The gross production of teak sawnwood - both export and local grade -
increased less than anticipated at appraisal because Sawmill No. 4 worked at only
one 8-hour shift instead of the two agreed at appraisal.
14.       The output of the project's plywood mill met the one-shift target by
March 1992 and attained 77% of the two-shift target by June 1992, in cooperation
with the buyer, who supplied the glue and auxiliary inputs.
Project Sustainability
15.       In common with the Wood Industries I Project, the potential economic
benefits will not be realized until impediments preventing full utilization are
removed. The rehabilitated teak sawmill which represents 20% of total project
cost is only being operated on a one-shift basis instead of on two shifts, which
was the basis for justification of the project. It was also expected that the new
mills provided under the two projects would replace the older inefficient mills
but the old mills continues to operate and to compete with the new mills for
supply of logs. Improvement of power supply at Yangon and Pyu is also necessary.
Management is severely constrained in that it has no control over log supply,
staffing and importation of auxiliary inputs.
Findings and Lessons Learned
16.       The  main  lessons  which  emerge  from  implementation  of  the  Wood
Industries II Project, which may be relevant to wood processing projects
elsewhere, relate to the following:
(a)    Before committing the Borrower to major export-oriented capital
investments  in  a  sub-sector,  the  financial  and  economic
viability of such proposals should be realistically assessed.
If the viability of a project depends largely on the closure of
existing facilities, quality of raw material, and availability
of electric power, the Government must be fully committed to
such measures and the project management must have sufficient
authority to ensure implementation. In the case of power
supply, the projects should be furnished with their own power
units based on the use of wood residues for power generation.



vi
(b)    The management  of  the project,  particularly when a state
enterprise is involved, is likely to face insurmountable
difficulties if it cannot operate according to commercial
principles because of Government-imposed restrictions. PU had,
for example, no control over the log supply to the project-
financed sawmills either in volume or in quality.
(c)    Project monitoring systems must be properly designed during
project preparation and provision for their introduction and
operation must be spelled out in the appraisal report. Project
staff as well as IDA staff carrying out supervision ought to
have a clear understanding of monitoring requirements.
(d)    Prior to project implementation, assurances should be obtained
from Government to procure equipment and construction material
of appropriate quality and quantity to undertake civil works in
a timely manner.

Subsector                     Forest and Forest Industries
2. Background
2.1       Myanmar is well-endowed with forest resources.  Climate and topography
together have contributed both to a rich variety of forest species and to a river
system providing good access for timber extraction.   Teak and a few other
valuable hardwood species have historically formed the major part of the forest
output. While forestry activities represent only a small share of GDP (less than
3*), the sector is of major importance in foreign trade where it traditionally
has been the second largest foreign exchange earner. Due to a steep decline in
the quantity of rice exported, timber and related products have surpassed rice
exports in value since FY 1984/85. Forestry revenues are an important source of
funds for the national budget and generally make a net contribution of about 10%
- 15% to public sector resources in the form of royalties, taxes and operating
surplus. All forests and most forest-based industries are owned and controlled
by Government of Myanmar (GOM). The Forest Department (FD) formerly within the
Ministry of Agriculture and Forests (MAF) is primarily responsible for the
management of all forest land.   The Myanma Timber Enterprise (MTE), formerly
known as Timber Corporation (TC), a State Economic Enterprise (SEE) under MAF,
continues to be responsible for all teak sawmilling, veneer manufacturing and
export. Since 1989 non-teak hardwood logging, processing and export has been
opened to the private sector.
2.2       In the early seventies, International Development Association (IDA)
economic and sector missions confirmed the high priority of the forestry sector
for the country's economic development and identified log extraction capacity as
the major problem. Timber extraction reached a peak of 2.3 million m3 in 1972/73
and after that declined to a low of 1.8 million m3 in 1975/76 due to a shortage
of extraction equipment and fuel. With the help of the IDA-assisted Forestry I
(Cr. 493; July 1974) and II (Cr. 949, Sept. 1979) . Projects and the ADB-assisted
Sagaing Forestry Project which provided support in the form of a new equipment
and technical assistance, the decline was reversed and about 2.8 million m3 of
teak and other hardwoods were extracted in 1979/80. Having established a log
extraction program on a sound footing, Government strategy then focused on
improving processing of forest products and in mid-1979 Government submitted to



- 2 -
IDA a request for financing of a series of projects aimed at technical updating
of existing forest industries and the establishment of additional and new forest
industries.  IDA Wood Industries I Project  was completed in early 1990 with
project objectives only partially achieved. Despite a significant increase in
wood recovery measured by the input/output ration of Teak Sawmill No.1, the
economic rate of return at completion of sawmills was negative due to shortage
of raw material and working on only a one-shift basis instead of two.
3.        Project Obiectives and Description
3.1       The Wood Industries II Project was conceived as the second in a series
of projects that GOM wished to undertake in order to improve the efficiency of
the wood processing industry, and to increase recovery and quality of semi-
finished and finished wood products, while supplying the domestic market with
cheaper hardwoods so that some of the valuable and locally used teak could be
freed for export. The main objectives of the project were to: (i) improve further
the efficiency and product quality of Myanmar's export oriented teak processing
industry through modernization and rehabilitation of existing capacity; (ii)
improve the supply of hardwood, sawn timber and panel products to the domestic
market and thereby reduce the use of teak for construction purposes in the
domestic market; (iii) introduce production of block board production for the
first time in Myanmar; and (iv) advance further the technical and export
marketing skills of teak processing industry personnel, through training and
technical assistance.
3.2       The project was to be implemented over five years and was to be
located in Yangon (formerly known as Rangoon), Monywa and Pyu. Its major
components were:
(a) Rehabilitation of Teak Sawmill No. 4 at Ahlone to saw about 45,000
Hoppus  (H)  tons  per  annum of  teak  logs  using modern  band  saw
technology;
(b)  Reconstruction of Teak Sawmill No. 14 at Dallah to saw 45,000 H tons
of teak logs also using modern band saw technology;
(c)  Construction of a new panel products mill at Monywa to produce 4,000
m3 plywood and 1,000 m3 teak veneer annually, and to introduce
production of block board on a pilot scale;
(d) Construction of two mobile hardwood sawmills with annual throughout
capacity of 10,000 H tons to be located in North Pegu area;
(e) Strengthening and modernizing technical skills of wood industry
personnel through technical assistance and training;
(f) Strengthening of administrative and construction facilities; and
(g) Incremental working capital.
3.3       The  total  project  cost  was  estimated  to  be  US$  57.4  million
(K 452 million) of which US$ 26.5 million (K 114 million) would be local costs,
and US$ 30.9 million (K 243 million) foreign exchange costs. The IDA credit of
SDR 23.7 million (US$ 25 million equivalent) was to finance foreign exchange



- 3 -
costs. The Finnish International Development Agency (FINNIDA) was to provide, on
a grant basis, the plywood manufacturing equipment and the technical assistance
and training component costing about US$ 6.0 million equivalent in foreign
exchange. TC was to finance US$ 26 million equivalent of local costs. Project
implementation was to be undertaken by a semi-autonomous project unit (PU) within
TC.
4.        Proiect Design and OrQanization
4.1       The Wood Industries II Project evolved from the Government strategy
for the forest and forest industries sector which emphasized higher export
earnings through better utilization of the country's natural resources;
recognizing the importance of the forest and forest industries sector as now
being the largest foreign exchange earning sector in Myanmar and acknowledging
the problems created by an old and inefficient capital stock.
4.2       In 1974, GOM and TC embarked on a rehabilitation and modernization
program with the Forestry I Project (Cr. 492-BA; July 1974), followed by the
Forestry II (Cr. 949-BA; Sept. 1979) and the Wood Industries I projects.
Restricted implementation capacity of TC, shortage of  funding and necessary
phasing of the investments proposed within the first phase program to protect
income flow during rehabilitation, resulted in the reduction of the scope of the
first wood industries project and also of the present project.
4.3       The second wood industries project was identified and discussed with
TC, in May 1982. The Food and Agriculture Organization/Cooperative Program
(FAO/CP) assisted with project preparation in October 1982. The proposed project
was intended to continue the program undertaken in the first project.
4.4       The choice of a semi-autonomous project unit  (PU)  within TC to
implement the project was based on past successful practice in IDA-assisted
projects that were largely for log extraction. As it turned out, the degree of
autonomy of PU might have been sufficient for a forestry project; however, with
wood industries projects, IDA entered into a different category of projects which
required a more independent management. Although PU was managed by a high level
officer from TC with direct access to the Managing Director, it was constrained
in that it had no control over log supply, no control over foreign exchange for
the import of auxiliary inputs (particularly glue for plywood processing), and
no control over project staffing. This adversely affected not only project
implementation but also project results.
5.        Prolect Implementation
5.1       Actual project cost, US$ 65.78 million, was about 151 higher than the
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) estimate. Expenditure on the panel products mill was
about twice SAR estimate (US$ 38.78 million versus US$ 18.6 million) while
expenditure on teak sawmill reconstruction was reduced considerably. (US$ 1.48
million compared to SAR estimate of US$ 15.4 million) . The credit agreement was
amended to allow financing for importation of petroleum and materials required
for the manufacture of panel products.



- 4 -
5.2       The project was jointly supported by an IDA credit of SDR 23.7 million
(US$ 25.0 million equivalent at appraisal) and FINNIDA grant of
US$ 6.0 million. Due to depreciation of the US Dollar, IDA disbursement of SDR
23.5 million yielded US$ 30.9 million. It is interesting to note however, that
during the project period 1984 to 1993, the official exchange rate for the
Myanmar Currency, the Kyat (K) , actually reflected an appreciation in value
relative to the US dollar rising from US$ 1 = K 8.25 to US$ 1 = K 6.24, while the
parallel market rate of the local Kyat fell to about US$ 1.00 = K 100 with the
introduction of Foreign Exchange Currency (FEC) by GOM in 1993.
5.3       Considering  the  system-inherent  constraints  of  a  largely  state
controlled sector, the problems encountered during the implementation of project
works were to be expected. The most critical variances between planned and actual
implementation were delays at start-up which arose for reasons that were beyond
the control of PU. Shortage of cement, delays in providing electric power to the
new installations and allocation of staff caused delays in construction
completion of almost two years at sawmill sites and over four years at the
plymill site. The proposed new sawmill No. 14 at Dallah had to be dropped due to
unavailability of electric power. Despite the slow start implementation of the
project picked up rapidly. The credit closing was originally scheduled for March
31, 1990 but it had to be extended three times to March 31, 1993 to complete
targets.
5.4       Rehabilitation of Teak Sawmill No. 4.    Rehabilitation of the mill
under the project was completed in December 1988, providing a throughput capacity
of 54,150 m3 (30,000 H tons). In comparing mill performance for the three years
prior to rehabilitation with that for the three years following rehabilitation
true wood recovery rose from 30.8% to 33.7%. However, production at one shift
has on the average fallen by more than 50%, from 17,848 m3 in 1984-86 to 8,089
m3 in 1989-91 due to excessive lost time as a result of power failure (93 working
days in 91/92) and due to shortage of logs (only 46% of required volume)
resulting in an added production loss of about one third of the target capacity.
The mill is designed to run at full capacity for two shifts with a minimum of
down time and unless actual utilization approaches installed capacity the mill
will be uneconomic. Despite the investment in modern sawing equipment, export-
grade production as a portion of total sawnwood output did not increase but
actually declined slightly from 63% to 61% because of poor log quality.
5.5       Reconstruction of Teak Sawmill No. 14 at Dallah.  A new sawmill was
to be installed near the existing teak sawmill which was in poor condition. After
reconstruction, the capacity was to be increased from about 19,000 H tons to
45,000 H tons, allowing phasing out of an additional 26,000 H tons of old and
inefficient teak sawmilling capacity elsewhere. The location was excellent from
the point of view of raw material supply - from MTE log depots at Obo and
Kyachung - and transport of finished goods to the Yangon harbor; all locations
are within five miles of the mill site. However, despite GOM's assurance during
negotiations, electric power was not supplied by The Electric Power Corporation
(EPC) . It was learnt from the IDA-f inanced Wood Industries I Project that agreed
phasing-out of old and inefficient teak sawmilling capacity would not take place.
Consequently, this project component was dropped.

5.6       Construction  of  Plvmill  No.  5 at Monywa  (Panel  Product Mill).
Installation of the new Plymill No. 5 at Monywa was the most delayed of all
project mills. Production started only in fiscal year 1991/92 after successful
completion of the training component. At the end of 1992 production reached 33%
of plywood capacity in one shift. In 1992/93 monthly plywood output was about
25,000 sheets (298 m3) running two shifts. This was equivalent to 75% of the
final  goal  of  33,300   (397  m3)  sheets/months  or  400,000  sheets/year
(4,768 m3/year) . Actual production figures for the first half year 1992 compared
with targets are as follows:

5.7       Blockboard production started only in August 1992, as the required
machinery was not installed in time. Two eight-hour shifts were introduced in
order to achieve 75% of the total production capacity in 1992/93. But the second
shift - from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. - has experienced severe problems because of the
power cuts in the early evening (5-10 p.m.) and the permanent curfew situation
in the night hours.
5.8       Sliced veneer production is not significant despite the installation
of two horizontal veneer slicing machines because of lack of demand for teak
veneer produced in Myanmar, which does not meet international market standard.
Only the "crown" design is produced in Myanmar instead of   the more highly
favored "streaky" design which is achieved by the "quarter cut" technique. Thus,
the revenue of less than one US Dollar per square meter of sliced veneer of 0.6
mm of thickness is far below of values which are currently achieved by export of
veneer-grade logs. This problem can be overcome only by installation of a
horizontal bandsaw and a turnable log carriage with spindles to enable quarter-
cutting teak logs on an industrial scale.
5.9       Future  financial  results and foreign exchange earnings  from the
Plywood Mill No. 5 are expected to be quite high with the signing of a contract
for the production of export quality plywood with an importer which supplies its
own glue, gives technical assistance - mainly in quality control and export
marketing & shipping - and pays a reasonable ex-factory price of US$ 226.80 per
m3.
5.10      At the beginning of operations in FY 1991-92 the true recovery rate
in the input/output ratio of the plywood manufacture was only 14%, due to



-  6 -
extremely low log quality. At the beginning of 1992 recovery rose to 44% -
probably on a experimental basis - dropped to 28%, and rose to 30% in FY 93 and
F 94, considerably below the target of 35W. The target can be achieved only by
providing fresh peeler logs as raw material. Savings from cancellation of Sawmill
No. 14 were used to purchase five 250-ton barges for bringing fresh peeler logs
of good quality and size to the mill.
5.11      Construction of Hardwood Sawmill No. 104 at Pyu.  The mill is well
designed and constructed and supplies construction timber to Yangon. The quality
of output is good and demand far exceeds mill output. However, the original
concept at appraisal for the installation of two mobile mills near to
clearfelling sites in plantation areas to saw small diameter logs economically
has been dropped as a consequence of shortage of labor and poor power supply from
the national grid.
5.12      In 1991/92,  the mill was able to produce only half of targeted
sawnwood or 1,531 m3 (1,081 H tons) instead of 3,115 m3 (2,200 S tons) at a true
recovery rate of 49.7% .
5.13      The major problems at this mill are the shortage of electric power (73
shutdown days in 1991/92); erratic supplies (1-4 hours per day only) including
unpredictable voltage drops paralyzing the main machinery; and shortage of raw
logs.
5.14      The poor quality of hardwood logs supplied to the mill is also a
problem as deliveries take too long (about three years after felling) . Logs
should reach the mill not later than 5-8 months after felling if true recovery
rates are to reach levels normally expected in commercial sawmills.
5.15      Action needs to be taken to provide an alternative power supply to the
mill preferably by making use of the mill residues. The wood-gasification power
plant proposed at appraisal could not be provided because there are none
available for this purpose in the world market. The economic feasibility of power
supply by steam motors burning sawmill residues for steam generation is a
technologically viable alternative which needs to be investigated.
6.        Project Results
6.1       Project objectives were only partially achieved. Measured by a three
year average input/output ratio of Sawmill No. 4 - where the obsolete and
inefficient equipment had been replaced by new equipment under the project - wood
recovery increased by 7 hoppus points from 39 without the project (1984 to 1986)
to 46 with  the project  (1989-91); or  from  31%  to  36%  of  true  recovery
respectively. Thus, the gain of 5 hoppus points assumed at appraisal (based on
2 hoppus points for the reduction of oversized allowances and 3 hoppus points for
the reduction of sawdust losses by smaller sawing kerfs through band-sawing
rather than circular sawing) has been largely achieved, despite lower teak log
quality delivered by MTE to mills. In this context, the overall recovery at all
MTE's teak sawmills fell from 42.8 hoppus points (33.6t true) to less than 40
hoppus points (31.4% true) during the project period because of decreasing
quality and diameter of logs delivered to old mills (including those not shut
down after establishment of the two new mills by Wood Industry I Project and the



- 7 -
rehabilitation of one mill under this project). Two mobile bandsaws have been
installed in the new hardwood Sawmill No. 104. In 1991-92, the recovery rate
measured by the input/output ratio came up to 63 hoppus points (50% true
recovery) despite breaking down old logs which were felled on the average three
years before delivery to the mill. The significant higher rate for hardwood in
comparison with teak sawmilling is to be explained by larger log diameters,
better log quality and higher sales of secondary sawmilling products.
6.2       The expected increase in the export of teak processed products - teak
sawnwood, plywood and teak veneer - has not been achieved. At Sawmill No. 4,
sawnwood exports decreased slightly from 63% to 61%, mainly due to the decreasing
quality of logs arriving at the mill. Exports from the rehabilitated Band-Sawmill
No. 4 amounts to only three quarters of the export share achieved by the new
band-sawmills established under Wood Industry I Project. Export of teak-faced
plywood and teak veneer dropped to zero in all mills due to the low market demand
of teak veneer sliced in Myanmar (see para 5.8) . The policy implication is that
with the very low prices for Myanma-sliced veneer teak, logs should be exported
for breaking down abroad by a better slicing technique resulting in thinner
veneer sheets (down to 0.2 mm) and better "design".

6.3       In 1991/92, the country's export of non-teak-faced pl.ywood also
dropped to zero. However, the project's plymill signed a contract covering the
mill's total plywood production capacity of 4,770 m3/year (400,000 sheets 8' x
4' x 4 mm) which could be expanded to 6,000 m3/year (500,000 sheets) if raw
material supply meets the requirements in volume and quality.
6.4       The gross production of teak sawnwood - both export and local grade
- increased less than anticipated at appraisal because Sawmill No. 4 worked
only one 8-hour shift instead of two 8-hour shifts per day as agreed at
appraisal. This variance is partially explained by the fact that the proposed
phasing out of six of the old and inefficient sawmills did not take place
during the implementation of both World Bank-financed Wood Industries
Projects. Another reason for the disappointing teak sawnwood production was
the limited sawlog supply to the project mills. Between 1982/83 and 1990/91,
log exports increased from 109,000 m3  to 199,000 m3. During the same period,
export of teak conversion dropped from 95,000 m3 to 55,000 m3 or by 40%. The
project sawmill continues to operate on a reduced capacity utilization which
is also reflected in the falling incremental production figures. The third
reason for the low production of Sawmill No. 4 is the restricted power supply
and consequent power failures which in 1991/92 (together with 22 lost days
caused by machine breakdown) came up to 115 lost days out of 242 working days;
i.e. almost only 50t of the available working capacity.
6.5       The Plymill No. 5 exceeded technical specifications for production
during testing. The mill produced about 19,000 sheets per month compared with
the design target of about 16,000 per month, for one shift. Quality was high
with only 1.8% of sheets rejected compared with the 10% expected. The quality
performance was achieved at the expense of recovery of plywood from logs by
drastic trimming of waste from feeder logs. However, without adequate fresh
log supply and other inputs, full utilization of capacity was not reached and
mill viability remains in question.
6.6       The extremely low teak veneer production at all mills in Myanmar
is closely related to the reasons indicated above. It is MTE's policy to sell
high quality veneer logs on the world market rather than process them on their
own slicer machines as teak veneer manufacturers abroad use a sophisticated
technology of slicing flitches down to a thickness of 0.20 mm producing
theoretically 5,000 m2 of veneer out of one m3 of flitches. This compares with
a rated output of 1,666 m2 with a minimum thickness of 0.6 mm by the project
mill which is only supposed to produce the veneers for their outturn of teak-
faced plywood.
7.        Project Sustainability
7.1       The project's contribution to the modernization of Myanmar's wood
processing industry is potentially significant. However, the full economic
benefits will not be realized unless and until impediments to full utilization
are removed. The rehabilitated teak sawmill which represented 20% of total
project costs was designed to be operated with two shifts and the investment
was justified on that basis. Furthermore, IDA supported this investment on the
assumption that the new mills provided in the two Wood Industries Projects
would replace less efficient old mills in order to increase productivity of



- 9-
teak sawmilling and to improve the quality of end products, resulting in
higher economic returns to the nation. At present, the new mills are operated
only during one shift and they are treated the same way as the old inefficient
mills in allocating logs, both in terms of quantity and quality. MTE continues
to follow a policy designed to maintain the old teak mills and the existing
log supply is distributed equally among all mills. Because of this policy, it
has not been possible to supply the project-financed mills with enough logs to
operate two shifts. Unless MTE takes action to reduce log supplies to the old
mills and direct them to the new mills, this will continue to be the case.
Moreover, improvement of power supply at Yangon and Pyu sawmills as well as
the introduction of a second daily 8-hour shift are essential. The mill at
Monywa is extremely dependent on improvement of log quality and log diameters
and international cooperation with market enterprises should be extended to
sliced veneer as well. For the latter, a horizontal bandsaw including a
spindle-type and turnable log carrier will be needed in order to render
possible the required "quarter cut" technique. The main conditions to achieve
the project sustainability can be summarized as follows:
(a) raw material supply to the primary processing plants to be
adequate in volume and quality;
(b) the obsolete and inefficient old teak sawmills to be closed
and the new mill to be run partially or fully with non-teak
hardwood;
(c) availability of foreign exchange for imports of auxiliary
production materials such as glue and hardener for plywood
making in case of the current agreement ceases;
(d) promotion of joint-venture/buy-back agreements in order to
overcome constraints in: the supply of auxiliary production
materials to the mills, the access to and provision of up-to-
date market information, the provision of required production
techniques and design and export quality control;
(e) Finally, efficient mills should be able to enter into joint
partnerships or management arrangements with private sector
partners, local or foreign. At present, MTE is not competitive
with private enterprises which are already dominating the non-
teak hardwood log export and log processing market. MTE should
place individual mills on a free enterprise basis able to
engage in price and quality competition and having some
discretion over incentive wages. There are precedents for this
already (Monywa). Any mills not able to operate on a self-
sustaining basis should be divested, rented out or closed.
8.        IDA Performance
8.1       IDA financing enabled Government to improve the efficiency of part
of the wood processing industry and to address the sub-sector's technical and
marketing constraints. Given the poor state of the country's old sawmills,
IDA's decision to concentrate assistance on sawmilling where capital
investments would be most beneficial, was appropriate, particularly for non-



- 10 -
teak hardwood sawmilling in order to support the local construction
industries. As this was the first major operation in the wood industries
sector involving a substantial technology transfer through the modernization
of teak and non-teak hardwood sawmilling, plywood and blockboard making and
veneer manufacture, IDA inclusion of technical assistance, along with training
component was therefore fully justified. By reducing the original project
scope during appraisal, IDA sought to reduce implementation problems.
8.2       However, the risk analysis at appraisal did not consider the case
that the old mills would continue to operate and compete for logs; that new
mills would be operated at only one shift; and that the shortage of electric
power supply would constrain the regular production of the mills. Also,
because of the high export prices for teak logs, but comparatively
unattractive world market prices for sawn teak, modernization and
rehabilitation of more existing hardwood mills would have been more
profitable. In retrospect, it appears that the project appraisal was over-
optimistic in estimating the benefits to be generated by the project's capital
investment. Also, while IDA was certainly aware of marketing aspects and
domestic policy constraints, it did not fully take into account the impact
which these would have on the project.
8.3       IDA carried out 16 supervision missions.  Supervision was helpful
in identifying deficiencies in implementation and in requesting GOM to effect
remedies. IDA was insistent, albeit unsuccessful, in getting Government to
close down old mills and to improve the log supply situation for project
mills.
8.4       The main lessons which emerge from implementation of the Wood
Industries II Project, which may be relevant to wood processing projects
elsewhere, relate to the following:
(a) Before committing the Borrower to major export-oriented
capital investments in a sub-sector, the financial and
economic viability of such proposals should be realistically
assessed. If the viability of a project depends largely on the
closure of existing facilities, quality of raw material, and
availability of electric power, the Government must be fully
committed to such measures and the project management must
have sufficient authority to ensure implementation. In the
case of power supply, the projects should be furnished with
their own power units based on the use of wood residues for
power generation.
(b) The management of the project, particularly when a state
enterprise is involved, is likely to face insurmountable
difficulties if it cannot operate according to commercial
principles because of Government-imposed restrictions. PU had,
for example, no control over the log supply to the project-
financed sawmills neither in volume nor in quality.
(c) Project monitoring systems must be properly designed during
project preparation and provision for their introduction and



- 11 -
operation must be spelled out in the appraisal report. Project
staff as well as IDA staff carrying out supervision ought to
have a clear understanding of monitoring requirements.
(d) Prior to project implementation, assurances should be obtained
from Government to procure equipment and construction material
of appropriate quality and quantity to undertake civil works
in a timely manner.
9.        Borrower Performance
9.1       TC/MTE played the leading role in preparing the project in
collaboration with FAO/CP, and in coordinating project implementation. Project
management was of good professional standard but was constrained by lack of
autonomy and by delays in the execution of civil works, staff build-up and
operation of project-financed processing capacities which were in large part
outside its control. Staff quality at operational level was enhanced through
local and overseas training provided under the project. TC/MTE had rightly
instituted a policy which required all overseas trainees to remain in their
positions for at least two years after returning from their training tours.
9.2       In retrospect, the location of sawmills in the southern area within
or near the country's capital led to the current situation of poor power
supply. It is fair to state, however, that during appraisal independent power
generation based on the mill's own wood residues was proposed for the mobile
sawmills, now located at Pyu. Unfortunately, the risk analysis did not
consider that based on the experience from other countries, private initiative
and international entrepreneurial cooperation would be essential for the
economic performance of wood processing. This applies particularly to Myanmar
since market intelligence, access to fresh market information and management
skills are not readily available. In summary, it could be said that individual
projects are not likely to succeed in improving substantially the efficiency
of state enterprises like MTE, unless project management is accorded a high
degree of autonomy and commercial principles are strictly applied.
9.3       The Borrower fully met the financial obligations required for
implementation of the project but did not comply adequately with all legal
agreements:
(a) The Borrower gave assurance that the project mills would be
operated at least on a two shift basis, but, up to now, TC has
been reluctant to adopt two shift operations at the project's
sawmills because of its policy of favoring exports in log form
rather than in sawnwood. Although the two sawmills constructed
under the project are fully operational, TC has taken no
action and has no concrete plans to run the mills on two
shifts.
(b) Log supply to the new mills is not satisfactory partly due to
excess sawmilling capacity in Yangon because of TC reluctance
to close old mills, favoring log export of high quality logs
and leaving low quality logs for local sawmills.



- 12 -
9.4       The main lessons of experience for the Borrower relevant to future
projects can be summarized as follows:
(a) Improving the efficiency of a sub-sector through individual
projects requires not only a high degree of autonomy in
project management but also the application of commercial
principles by the Borrower or through participation of local
and foreign private enterprises.
(b) The introduction of capital-intensive technology into a sub-
sector can only be successful if the requirements for a viable
operation are met. These include, first of all, an assured
supply of raw materials and auxiliary inputs, sufficient labor
and trained staff as well as remunerative output prices. Local
prices for wood products should reflect opportunity costs.
(c) In order to avoid unnecessary delays in civil works at project
start, building sites should be selected during project
preparation and the availability of construction material,
both local and imported, must be assured.
10.       Proiect Relationship
10.1       No major problems were encountered in the relationship between IDA
and the Borrower, and between them and the participating agencies in the
project.
11.       ConsultinQ Services
11.1      Both external and local contractors and consultants were engaged in
carrying out the project. The performance of contractors and of the suppliers
of machinery and equipment is considered very satisfactory. Delays that
occurred in construction work were due to reasons that were outside the
contractors' control. The project's technical assistance and training program
financed by FINNIDA on a grant basis and carried out by a Finnish consulting
firm specialized in training in the field of wood processing was considered
useful.
12.       Project Documentation and Data
The Credit Agreement was quite adequate and appropriate for
achieving the project's primary objectives. The SAR provided a useful
framework for IDA and the TC/MTE during project implementation. Its key
tables, in particular, those concerning detailed cost, proposed credit
allocation and disbursement projections were used as benchmarks during
supervision. Most relevant to the Borrower was the presentation of detailed
features of the project components. The project accounting system had been
constantly improved during implementation and the data relevant to preparing
the PCR were partially available.
